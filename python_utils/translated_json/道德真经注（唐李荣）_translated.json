  "full_translation": "**The *Daode Zhengjing Zhu* (Commentary on the *True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*)**\n\n**Title and Attribution:**\n*The Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*. Composed by the Daoist Li Rong during the Tang High Zhen period. The original text comprised two scrolls. Two fragmentary versions now survive:\n1. *The Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), under the *Dongshen* (Cavernous Gods) section of the *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) category, preserving the original preface and commentaries on thirty-six chapters of the Dao scripture, arranged in four scrolls.\n2. A Dunhuang fragmentary manuscript, containing commentaries on the *Dejing* (Virtue Classic) forty-four chapters and the thirty-seventh chapter of the Dao scripture. Though combined, the two texts remain partially incomplete.\n\nThe present edition collates the *Daozang* version with the Dunhuang manuscript, supplemented by the *Daode Zhengjing Xuande Mushu* (Mysterious Virtue and Profound Commentary on the *True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*) by Qiang Sici (hereafter, the Qiang Edition), reconstructing a complete text. The original work lacked chapter divisions; these have been added according to the standard transmitted version.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the *Daode Zhengjing***\n\nThe Daoist subject Rong humbly speaks:\n\nI have heard that the silent and tranquil precedes the primal heaven,\nYet the heavens lack brilliance to reveal its splendor.\nThe undifferentiated gives rise to things,\nYet the myriad things are insufficient to fathom its subtlety.\n\nThis is the transcendent and ineffable—\nBeyond all forms, yet profound and boundless.\nIt traces the profound workings of the Cosmic Potter,\nAnd its principle lies in the responsiveness of the Void.\nIt unfolds the hidden paths of the Craftsman-Guide,\nAnd its meaning resides in the numinous diagram.\n\nThus, the sacred scriptures of the Celestial Village\nEstablish communion with the Imperial Symbols before their manifestation;\nThe True Sovereign of Ku County\nReveals the august origin of the numinous spirit.\n\nFive thousand years of blessings descend,\nAnd the mystic wind manifests in harmony with the Celestial.\nThe twin pillars flow with divine destiny,\nAnd the purple qi shines upon the Imperial Throne.\n\nI humbly observe that Your Majesty,\nWith jade-like virtue compiling the sacred,\nAnd golden gates responding to the diagram,\nIlluminates the radiance across the waves of the luminous mirror,\nWhile auspicious vapors drift over the peaks of longevity.\nYou nurture the divine at Fen River,\nAnd with the Great Compass alone transform—\nSeeking the Dao at the Yellow River’s banks,\nAnd practicing supreme benevolence without domination.\n\nThe sacred texts of the numinous caves\nYou personally labor to revere,\nAnd the secret scrolls of the Immortal Metropolis\nYou graciously peruse with sagacious insight.\nConcentrating at the Yellow Court to embody the subtle,\nAnd bathing in the Dark Feminine to flow with humility,\nYou thus attain the stillness of the *Niqishang* (Rainbow Robe) wind,\nAnd sever the transformations of the *Kunhai* (Dark Sea) with non-action.\n\nExamining the scripture, I see that the Sage governs\nBy attending to affairs of non-action,\nAnd practices the teaching of unsaid words.\nIt is also said: *\"The Sage governs by emptying the mind and filling the belly.\"*\nThese anterior and posterior numinous confirmations\nAre as if seals fitting together.\n\nAncient and modern masters\nDo not clarify the profound intent,\nFor the divine spirit has yet to behold the Sage’s concentrated stillness.\n\nNow, the Heavenly Opening of Your Majesty’s heart\nShines brightly and distinctly—\nTruly the manifestation of the primal transformation of Great Peace,\nUnfolding before the ages,\nAnd establishing the supreme function of non-action,\nDisplaying auspicious omens for a thousand generations.\n\nHow could it merely echo the *Hetu* (River Diagram) records,\nTransmitted in vain since the Han,\nOr the vermilion inscriptions of the Shang,\nMerely preserving the characters of the Zhou?\n\nIts words are subtle yet profound,\nIts principles profound yet distant.\nLike gazing upward to the *Xīhé* (Sun God),\nWhere the six voids shine uniformly,\nOr being moistened by the Supreme Good,\nWhere all things harmonize.\n\nThus, past sages and virtuous worthies vied to explore its depths,\nWhile Wei-Jin scholars of brilliance faltered at the threshold of being and non-being.\nQi-B Liang Daoists erred in admonishing and encouraging within the domain of non-trace.\nThose who merely echoed it were enshrouded in mist,\nTalking of nothing but emptiness;\nThose who wandered astray were lost in vaporous illusions,\nFirmly grasping at existence.\nSome merely touched upon the upper mechanism,\nLeaving it incomplete,\nWhile those clinging to petty knowledge\nMade it verbose without simplicity.\nThus, this single scripture has spawned a hundred commentaries,\nConfusing the Daoist winds like chaotic alarms,\nAnd mingling the *Jing* and *Wei* (clarity and muddiness) in the sea of wisdom.\nAssisting the age and guiding customs,\nSometimes obstructing the Dao’s gate,\nPiercing the void yet failing to unlock the key of emptiness.\n\nI, Rong, though my years are devoted to the Dao,\nAnd my name recorded in the elixir registers,\nHave rinsed my heart in the pure stream yet it is not still water,\nAnd though I face the dark stone, my mirror hangs askew.\nDwelling among the red cinnamon and white cassia,\nI have long listened to the fragrant winds,\nDancing and singing by the Green Stream,\nYet my back has been exposed to the Tang sun in vain.\n\nWith my inflated nature,\nI twice received the words of perspiration and toil,\nAnd thus dared to wield the jade scepter in the Purple Court,\nAnd listen to the golden decrees upon the Vermilion Steps.\nThough I frequently engaged in lofty discourse,\nMy inner sincerity remained unexpressed.\n\nFor the vast abyss of the Three Mountains\nI drift upon the Lynx Isle without measuring its depths;\nFor the nine wells of the flowing spring,\nI gaze upward at the Dragon’s virtue as if it still existed.\n\nDaring to exhaust my mediocrity,\nI venture to compose this commentary.\nThough I strive night and day,\nMy understanding is but a drop in the ocean,\nYet like the mountain’s foundation supporting the clouds,\nI hope to achieve something in the ant-hill of the world.\n\nMay I not merely imitate the myriad wonders,\nBut aspire to the formless symbol of the Dao’s pearl.\nWith dust clinging to the imperial canopy,\nI fear the depths of the abyss.\nWith utmost trepidation,\nI humbly present this offering.\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on the *Daode Zhengjing* – Scroll One**\n\n**Chapter 1**\n*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.*\n\n*The Dao*—this is the principle of the utmost void.\nTo discuss the principle of the utmost void,\nOne cannot divide its manifestation into being and non-being,\nNor can one measure its truth with high and low.\n\nThus, the utterly profound transcends prior cognition,\nAnd the utterly real cannot be grasped by mundane understanding—\n*\"Mysterious, yet difficult to ponder;\nProfound, yet impossible to fathom.\"*\n\nThe Sage wished to lay bare this profound path,\nAnd opened the gate of teaching,\nBorrowing the name *Round and Penetrating* (圓通)\nTo designate the principle of the utmost void.\nSince the principle can be named,\nAnd the named can be called *Dao*,\nIt is said: *\"I do not know its name; I call it Dao.\"*\n\n*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao*—\nThis is not the common, mundane Dao of humanity.\nThe common, mundane Dao of humanity\nIs honored through rites and propriety,\nValued for its superficial brilliance,\nWhere one sacrifices the self for fame,\nAnd forgets the self for gain.\nHaving lost the Dao and its virtue,\nThis teaching now prevails.\n\nNow, having discarded the superficial trappings of benevolence and righteousness,\nAnd taken the substance of Dao and virtue,\nCeasing frivolous conduct and returning to the pure source,\nReversing habitual emotions—\nThus, it is called *the Dao that is not the eternal Dao*.\n\n**The name that can be named is not the eternal name.**\n*The name*—this is the designation of the Great Dao.\nI forcefully name it: *\"Great!\"*\nA name does not stand alone;\nIt arises from the substance.\nA character does not exist independently;\nIt is established by virtue giving form to principle,\nAnd in its operation, it does not stagnate—\nEncompassing all, it reaches the boundless.*\n\n**The Dao That Can Be Named**\n\nThus, with the name of the Great Dao,\nI proclaim its essence,\nSo that all things may understand it.\nHence, it is said: *\"The name that can be named.\"*\n\nThe name that is not the eternal name—\nThis is the name of vain worldly glory, not the true.\nTherefore, I reject it as *not the eternal Dao*,\nSo that one may abandon the transient and return to the eternal truth.\n\nNames arise from causes,\nAnd wisdom progresses by gradual or sudden stages.\nTo open the way with principles,\nOne seizes the transient to grasp the eternal truth.\n\nWhen laid out to its ultimate conclusion,\nThere is no eternal Dao to seize,\nNor is there a true eternal to take.\nNot only is it not the eternal Dao,\nBut it is also not the transient.\nIf it is not the transient, then the eternal is transient,\nAnd if it is not the eternal Dao, it is also not the transient.\nThus, the eternal and the transient are both beyond grasp.\n\nBefore names arose, Heaven and Earth began.\nWith names, all things took form.\nThe Dao’s virtue is profound and mysterious,\nIts principle transcends existence and non-existence.\nSince existence and non-existence are transcended,\nNames are cast aside.\n\nYet the function of boundless emptiness—\nWhere can it not apply?\nTherefore, though it is not existence, it exists,\nAnd the nameless is the origin of the two *complementaries*.\nThough it is not non-existence, it is non-existent,\nAnd the named is the parent of all things.\nHence, the Dao generates virtue and nurtures,\nThis is what is meant.\n\nTo observe its mystery, one must be ever without desire.\nTo observe its subtlety, one must be ever with desire.\nAll who receive life\nDraw their origin from Dao and virtue,\nShare the same *qi* from Yin and Yang,\nYet their clarity and obscurity differ in spirit,\nTheir stillness and agitation differ in nature.\n\nIf one smooths the heart and stills the path,\nWashes the will in the mysterious depths,\nThen desires cannot disturb the spirit,\nAnd distractions cannot cloud the intention—\nThe luminous *spirit platform* is clear and still,\nThe profound *mirror of the Dao* is deep and bright—\nThen one may perceive the faintest traces,\nComprehend the subtlest mysteries.\nThis is the *conduct of without desire*.\n\nIf one cannot yet abandon the mind,\nAnd remains bound to the realm of existence,\nChasing after right and wrong,\nAgitating over sounds and colors,\nThen one is merely caught in the affairs of existence,\nAnd does not recognize the principle of non-action.\nThis is the *conduct of with desire*.\n\nSubtlety is a trace, a return, a coming.\nThis means relying on Dao and virtue for conduct,\nObserving profound principles to enter the cycle—\nLosing the emptiness and stillness, calling them false,\nAnd staining oneself with coarse methods, drifting into subtlety and traces.\nThese two arise from the same source yet bear different names.\n\nSpeaking closely,\nWith desire and without desire—these are the two.\nThis is called *humanity*.\n\nAll share the same substance of the Five *Eternal Virtues*,\nAnd all possess the same *mind of an inch*.\nThey are the same.\nTo dim the sharpness and embrace tranquility,\nTo pierce through the Dao’s source,\nThis is to attain the profound.\nTo compete with prior knowledge and be entangled in confusion,\nTo sink into the world’s realm,\nThis is to drift into subtlety.\nThese are the differing names.\n\nSpeaking broadly,\nThe sages sought to expound the principle of boundless emptiness,\nThus taking Dao and virtue as their core.\nTherefore, in this chapter,\nThey vividly illuminate this meaning,\nAnd pair it with Dao and virtue.\n\nHence, it is said:\nThough the two bear mixed and obscure principles,\nThey are one in essence.\nThe movement arising from stillness,\nThe use emerging from substance,\nHence, it is said: *they arise*.\nThe function of the Dao’s generation,\nThis is the *Dao itself*.\nThe meaning of nurturing,\nThis is the *virtue* made manifest.\nDao and virtue bear distinct names,\nThus, it is called *differing names*.\n\nThe profound is said to be the same.\nThe Dao of emptiness and stillness,\nThe profound virtue of mystery,\nIs not easily discerned,\nAnd its silent depth is not easily spoken.\nNo one can name it,\nSo it is called *the same*—\nThe mystery of the most profound mystery.\n\nWithout anything to establish,\nOnly the Dao and virtue can speak of the profound,\nHence, it is said: *\"The profound virtue is deep and distant,\nThe ultimate Dao is profound and still.\"*\n\nThe profound beyond the profound,\nIs the gateway to all mysteries.\nDao and virtue are remote and obscure,\nTheir principle surpasses words and forms.\nThe true core is empty and profound,\nTheir affairs transcend existence and non-existence.\n\nBorrowing speech beyond words and forms,\nRecording the marks of existence and non-existence,\nTo traverse the hidden path,\nHence, it is said: *\"The profound beyond the profound.\"*\n\nYet fearing those lost in direction may cling to rigid principles,\nAnd those who lose the principle may cling to fixed dogmas,\nIf one lingers here and calls it the true Dao,\nHence, it is said in its utmost terms:\nIt is not the mark of existence and non-existence,\nSo the name is called *profound*—\nBorrowing *profound* to cast off existence and non-existence.\nOnce existence and non-existence are cast aside,\nThe profound is also lost,\nHence, it is said: *\"The profound beyond the profound.\"*\n\nThe profound beyond the profound—\nThree reversals are not enough to speak of its extremity,\nFour phrases cannot fully convey its source.\nBoundless and unobstructed,\nIt encompasses the pivot of all phenomena,\nAnd opens the windows of a hundred spirits.\nThis is the gateway to all mysteries.\n\n**Two Chapters**\n\nAll under Heaven know *beauty* when it is called *beauty*,\nThen *evil* has already arisen.\n*Beauty* is *joy*.\nIt is said that humanity’s inherent nature\nCannot take the Dao as delight,\nBut takes desire as joy.\nJoy cannot be exhausted,\nAnd when joy reaches its peak, sorrow comes.\nDesire cannot be indulged,\nAnd when desire is indulged, the nature is harmed.\nHence, it is said: *\"All take sounds, colors, flavors, and tastes as supreme joy.\nThey do not know that sounds, colors, flavors, and tastes\nAre the greatest calamities of the *Great Uncarved Block*.\nOnce they become calamities of the *Great Uncarved Block*,\nThey also become the roots of sorrow.\nTo extinguish the nature and harm the body—\nThis is where *evil* arises.\"*\n\nAll know *good* when it is called *good*,\nThen *not-good* has already arisen.\nUnder Heaven and upon Earth,\nNoble and ignoble alike,\nFew can empty the heart and the self,\nYet all indulge desire and emotion.\nThough their loves differ,\nEach follows their own emotions—\nLoving names, they call names *good*;\nLoving gain, they call gain *good*.\nTo love gain as *good* is to seek gain without the Dao;\nTo love fame as *good* is to court fame to the point of self-destruction.\nThough it conforms to emotion, it is *not-good*.\nHence, the Master of *Bountiful Virtue* died for fame atop *Chief Yang*,\nAnd the Bandit *Zhi* died for gain beneath the *Eastern Mound*.\nThis is where *not-good* arises.\n\nHence, existence and non-existence give rise to each other,\nAll things under Heaven are born from existence,\nExistence from non-existence.\nFrom non-existence comes existence,\nAnd from existence returns non-existence.\nThus, it is said: *\"They give rise to each other.\"*\n\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nFor all difficult matters under Heaven\nMust first be made easy.\nDifficulty arises from ease,\nAnd ease accomplishes difficulty.\nEase arises from difficulty,\nAnd difficulty completes ease.\n\nLong and short take shape from each other,\nFor things separated have neither great nor small,\nBut gathered, they have short and long.\nThe *Great Mountain* and the *autumn hair* differ in proportion,\nThe *white crane* and the *green duck* differ in leg length—\nHence, it is known:\nTo avoid them is to have neither great nor small,\nTo preserve them is to have short and long.\n\nHigh and low incline toward each other—\n*Incline* means *danger*.\nWater can bear a boat,\nYet also overturn it.\nThe high relies on the low as its foundation,\nBut the low is as perilous as the high.\nThough the low is humble,\nIt yet endangers the high;\nThe high, though noble,\nIf it truly annihilates the low,\nThen when the *Dao* is lost, high and low endanger each other,\nBut when the *Dao* is attained, both ruler and subject find harmony.\n\nSound and voice harmonize together—\nThe ruler transforms the people below,\nLike wind swaying the grass.\nThe people follow the ruler above,\nLike echoes answering sound.\nIt is like the *gong* and *shang* notes,\nAlternately singing in harmony.\nIf the pitch is too high, the strings will snap;\nIf the ruler is too hasty, the people will grow restless.\nThus, when the Five Tones are in accord,\nThe Eight Sounds are perfectly attuned,\nAnd when governance is harmonious,\nThe people rejoice.\nHence it is said: *\"The sovereign is the people’s teacher,\nAnd the people take him as their model.\"*\n\nBefore and after follow in sequence—\nThe ruler acts first, and the minister follows;\nThe father acts first, and the son follows.\nThus, those who rule as fathers and sovereigns\nMust not act lightly or lose the heart of the *Dao*,\nBut should instead uphold stillness\nAnd align with *virtue*.\n\nTherefore, the Sage governs\nBy doing nothing yet achieving all,\nBy teaching without speaking,\nWhile all things act without complaint.\nGazing back through the ages,\nSome are coarse, some refined.\nSurveying the hundred kings,\nTheir steps were sometimes swift, sometimes slow.\nNone have inscribed their titles on golden tablets,\nNor recorded their deeds in royal annals.\nThe Emperor responds to the thousand-year cycle,\nAnd upholds the seven-hundred-year foundation,\nWithout wielding arms,\nYet takes joy in boundless fulfillment—\nThus, the sacred lineage shines far beyond its beginnings,\nAnd its destiny is sealed before form takes shape.\nHence it is said: *\"The Sage governs by doing nothing.\"*\n\nMighty generals stabilize the four quarters by upholding *威*,\nMinisters and officials govern by discussing the *Dao* and clarifying affairs—\nTheir influence is not through words alone.\nHence it is said: *\"They teach without speaking.\"*\n\n*Action* is what is spoken of here—\nThe four classes each fulfill their duties,\nAll things retain their true nature,\nAnd follow transformation naturally,\nWithout resistance or complaint.\nTo give birth yet not possess,\nTo entrust to *spontaneous transformation*,\nTo use without knowing—\nTo act yet not rely on it,\nTo treat all things as *chúgǒu* (sacrificial straw dogs),\nNot claiming *virtue* as one’s achievement.\nWhen success is attained, one does not dwell on it.\nThough adorned with splendor,\nOne remains detached and distant—\nSeeking the *Dao* beyond *Xiāngchéng*,\nAnd focusing the spirit toward *Gūshè*.\nOnly by not dwelling does one not depart.\nThe *Dao* pervades the universe,\nWhile *virtue* encompasses the Two Principles.\nThough *virtue* avoids functional display,\nThe people revere it.\nWith effortless governance, the Nine Regions are pacified,\nAnd through *wuwei*, the myriad states come in tribute,\nThe spirit ever serene.\nHence it is said: *\"It does not depart.\"*\n\n**Chapter Three:**\nNot to exalt the worthy\nMakes the people not contend.\nThe *Wang Dao* is vast and impartial,\nNobles and commoners alike are like jade and stone in the same dust,\nThe worthy and the foolish share the same rope—\nThis is the transformation of the *Great Dao*,\nWhere there is no contention.\nThe worthy must be placed in their proper station,\nRewards must be given for merit,\nThe foolish must be assigned to labor,\nPunishments must be meted for offenses.\nIf rewards exceed merit,\nExcess leads to arrogance and extravagance.\nIf labor exceeds capacity,\nPoverty and exhaustion follow.\nArrogance and extravagance breed deceit and violence—\nEven beasts, when cornered, will fight—\nThus, contention arises.\nHence the sun and moon shine impartially,\nNot altering their light for the worthy or unworthy;\nHeaven and Earth cover and nourish all,\nNot lightly changing their ways for the good or evil.\n\n**Chapter Four:**\nNot to prize rare treasures\nMakes the people not steal.\nAbandon the jade of ten cities,\nCast aside the pearls of a thousand gold,\nRegard them as tiles and rubble—\nWho would steal?\nIf desires are unseen,\nThe heart remains undisturbed.\nThe ears do not hear the *Zhèngwèi* zither and pipes,\nThe eyes do not see the beauties of *Páo Sì* and *Dá Jǐ*,\nThe heart is purified, the self cleansed,\nEmotions abandoned, desires forgotten—\nWho would be disordered?\nThus, the Sage governs\nWith unified *virtue* and accumulated *ren*,\nPerfecting goodness and beauty.\nThe *Laozi* wished to exalt the Sage’s *virtue*,\nSo he spoke of this as well:\nEmpty the heart,\nEliminate desires,\nSever right and wrong,\nAbandon myriad concerns,\nPreserve the One Truth.\nFill the belly,\nHold the *Dao* in the breast,\nLet *virtue* fill the inner self.\nWeaken the will,\nSoftening the heart to follow the *Dao* without resistance.\nStrengthen the bones—\nOnly when the *Dao* gathers in emptiness,\nWhen the empty heart embraces the *Dao*,\nWhen the *Dao* resides where there is no harm,\nDoes one attain the strength of the *xian*.\nAlways keep the people ignorant and desireless,\nSo that the wise dare not act.\nTo act with *wuwei* is to govern completely.\nAbove, spread the winds of *wuwei*,\nBelow, cultivate the pure and simple transformation.\nWhen the people follow above,\nAnd both high and low are at ease,\nThen there is no transformation that cannot be transformed.\n\nThe *Dao* is boundless yet used—\nOr it does not overflow.\n*Boundless* means *central*.\n*Overflow* means *full*.\nThe *Dao* is not a partial thing;\nIts use must lie in the center.\nHeaven abhors fullness—\nFullness invites loss,\nHence it is said: *\"It does not overflow.\"*\nFullness must have deficiency,\nEmptiness must have substance.\nThe *Dao* of central harmony\nIs neither full nor deficient,\nNeither having nor lacking.\nHaving and lacking are not true,\nFullness and deficiency are not real—\nBorrowing the medicine of the central path\nTo cure the ailments of the extremes.\nWhen the illness is gone, the medicine discarded,\nWhen the extremes are removed, the center forgotten,\nThere is nothing left at all.\nThis is also the meaning of *\"not overflowing.\"*\n\nDeep as the sea, it seems the origin of all things.\nThe sea is deep, so all streams flow toward it.\nThe *Dao* is deep, so all things revere and serve it.\nDull its sharpness—\nForeknowledge harms nature,\nProlonged evil harms others—\nThis is *sharpness*.\nWith an empty heart and forgotten self,\nThe *Dao* bends it—this is *dulling*.\nUntangle its confusion—\nDesires disrupt propriety,\nGain and loss confuse the heart—\nThis is *confusion*.\nAbandoning the other, forgetting the self,\nDistant from desires, controlling emotions—\nThis is *untangling*.\nHarmonize its brightness,\nBlend with the dust—\nSerene, as if it might exist.\nBright yet not dazzling,\nStained yet not blackened,\nHarmonious yet not obscured in form,\nBlended yet not burdened in truth.\nThus, it is known:\nSerene and tranquil, it remains ever present.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nYet it precedes the Emperor.\nThe *Dao* is profound and mysterious,\nA boundless abyss—\nEven *迎* and *随* cannot fathom its end.\nHow then can it be defined?\nHence it is said: *\"I do not know whose child.\"*\n\nUnlocking the natural order,\nIt is divided by the **Three Powers**,\nIts creative function unfolds,\nEncompassed by the **Ten Thousand Beings**.\nExamined in its practical application,\nIt precedes the Celestial Sovereign—\nThis mirrors Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Five**\nHeaven and Earth are without *virtue*,\nTreating all things as *chúgǒu*.\nLong and short define each other,\nRight and wrong oppose each other—\nThis is the natural *Dao*.\n\n*Virtue* is love,\nAnd where there is love, there is hatred.\nHeaven and Earth act without intention,\nSevered from love and hatred.\nBecause they love not,\nThey are called without *virtue*.\n\n*Chúgǒu*—\nStraw shaped into a dog,\nUsed in ancient rites,\nThen discarded.\n\nIt is said of people toward *chúgǒu*:\nThey use it without loving,\nAbandon it without hating.\n\nThis illustrates how Heaven and Earth,\nWarm as spring’s spontaneous harmony,\nAre not called *virtuous*,\nCold as autumn frost’s descent,\nAre not called *righteous*.\n\nThe Sage is without *virtue*,\nTreating the people as *chúgǒu*.\nThe Sage acts without intention,\nMerging in *virtue* with Heaven and Earth.\n\nWithout *virtue*, the meaning of *chúgǒu* is clear.\nThough grace nourishes grass and trees,\nBenevolence covers swine and fish,\nPropagating wind and unfolding transformation,\nIt must first benefit humanity—\nHence, \"the people.\"\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nIs it not like the *tuóqiè*?\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nMoving yet ever flowing.\n\n*Tuó*—the bellows.\n*Qiè*—the flute.\n*Yielding*—exhaustion.\n*Interval*—the space between.\n\nThe *tuóqiè* is hollow within,\nThus it emits sound and breath without exhaustion.\nHeaven and Earth are hollow within,\nThus they generate all things without end.\n\nIf one can empty the heart and body,\nDeploying wisdom and *virtue* without limit,\nThere is no exhaustion.\n\nMany words lead to ruin,\nBetter to hold to the center.\n\n*Ruined*—confined.\nAs if filling the world with reason yet committing no fault.\n\nSpeaking without precision—\nWords leave the mouth, calamity enters.\nCalamity enters—\nThis is ruin.\n\nYet calamity and fortune lie in correctness or error,\nGain and loss are not in excess.\n\nNow, many words lead to ruin—\nA warning against the loss of speech,\nEncouraging adherence to the center’s gain,\nSo that teaching is unobstructed and words forgotten within.\n\n**Chapter Six**\nThe *Gu* spirit does not die—\nThis is called the **Mysterious Female**.\nThe *River Above* said:\nNurturing the spirit is the method of *thinking-preservation*.\n\nHúisì remarked:\nThe emptiness within the valley—\nThis is metaphorical language.\n\nThough true sages’ lofty insights\nAre all explanations of things,\nNow we simplify the principle and attempt to speak.\n\n*Gu*—emptiness.\n*Xuan*—the *Dao*.\n*Pìn*—stillness.\n\nWith form and spirit, there is a master.\nWith birth and death, the *Dao* cannot be spoken of—\nFlowing, unstable, how can it be called still?\n\nIf one can empty form and spirit,\nAbandoning self and object,\nExhaling rootless *qi*,\nGathering without calling it birth,\nInhaling windowless *qi*,\nDispersing without calling it death—\nNeither death nor birth—\nThis is the *Dao* of the *Gu* spirit.\n\nBirth and death are unstable things.\nDeep, feminine, still—\nThis is the meaning of the *Mysterious Female*.\n\nThe **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—\nThis is the root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe *Dao* in stillness—\nFormless, without attributes.\nWhen it moves,\nIt generates Earth, generates Heaven.\n\n*Qi* manifests from here,\nThus it is called the **Gate**.\nHeaven and Earth depend on it to live,\nThus it is called the **Root**.\n\nEndless, as if it exists—\nUsing it is effortless.\n\n*Endless*—subtle and wondrous.\nThe *Dao* of the *Mysterious Female*\nNeither generates nor perishes,\nThe principle of feminine stillness\nNeither exists nor vanishes.\nTo speak of existence—no form is seen,\nTo speak of vanishing—all things are born.\n\nNeither flourishing nor decaying,\nNeither constant nor severed—\nThus, *endless*.\n\n*Effort*—toil.\nObtaining the *Dao* of the *Mysterious Female*,\nIts use is boundless, effortless leisure.\nThus, it is said: *effortless*.\n\n**Chapter Seven**\nHeaven endures, Earth persists.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth endure and persist\nIs that they do not generate themselves,\nThus they can endure and persist.\n\nThe sun and moon revolve and thin,\nTheir waxing and waning cannot be halted.\nYin and Yang contract and expand,\nThe cycles of cold and heat pass easily.\n\nAll things beneath them are insufficient,\nThus Heaven and Earth alone endure.\n\nExamining the *virtue* of Heaven and Earth,\nAsking the reason for their longevity,\nNone but the heartless,\nThe selfless in generation.\n\nIf one can model Heaven and Earth,\nActing without intention,\nNurturing without self-interest,\nThe bones of the Immortal will surpass gold and stone in endurance,\nThe *command* will embrace the square and round in permanence.\n\nIf one cannot abandon right and wrong to align with the *Dao*,\nDiscard emotions and desires to condense the *True Self*,\nThen deaf and blind to sound and color,\nNumb to fragrance and flavor,\nThe body toils externally,\nThe heart wearies internally—\nThen a hundred years are like morning dew,\nA thousand gold like evening dust.\n\nThus it is said:\nPeople’s disregard for death\nComes from their thickened vitality—\nThus they disregard death.\n\nHence the Sage places himself last,\nYet his body is first.\nHe sets himself aside,\nYet his body persists.\n\nFew abandon emotions and extinguish schemes,\nMany pursue desires and betray the *True Self*.\nOnly the Sage knows and acts.\n\nThis is acting in humility to dwell among things,\nPlacing *virtue* last so as to be first in honor,\nPreserving the *Dao* externally so the body persists with it.\n\nNot that he lacks selfishness—\nThus he fulfills his selfishness.\n\nOrdinary emotions are obscured,\nThe numinous awareness is clear.\nWithout a heart of utter impartiality,\nThere are actions of partiality.\nExalting self while burdening others,\nEnriching self while impoverishing others,\nDesiring to lead yet unable to surpass others,\nSeeking to preserve yet the body already lost.\n\nThe Sage, without intention, dwells first among things—\nNaturally first without emotion and desire, thus naturally preserved.\nHence it is said: *fulfilling his selfishness*.\n\n**Chapter Eight**\nThe highest *virtue* resembles water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwelling where people dislike—\nThus it approaches the *Dao*.\n\nThe principle is profound and distant,\nDifficult to fathom.\nThe virtuous cultivate the *Dao*,\nTheir actions are subtle and wondrous.\nThus water is borrowed as an analogy.\n\nWater can moisten things,\nThe *Dao* can rescue people—\nHence it is said: *beneficial*.\nWater clears blockages,\nThe *Dao* accommodates humanity—\nThus it is said: *does not contend*.\n\n「Things often abhor the low,\nYet people often love the high.\nNow water flows, drawn to the low,\nThe *Dao* acts with humility and retreat—\nThus it is said: *dwelling where people dislike*.\n\n**Near** (*几*) is **close**. The nature of water is akin to the *Dao*,\nHence it is taken as an analogy.\n\n*Residing in virtuous places*—\nWater does not choose its place,\nFlowing wherever it finds itself—\nThose who cultivate the *Dao*,\nWherever they dwell, is virtuous.\n\n*Heart’s virtue is profound*—\nWater’s stillness reflects clarity.\nHumans, when the heart is empty, become mirrors.\n*With virtue in kindness*—\nWater harmonizes with all things,\nKindness embraces the common folk.\n\n*Words of virtue are trustworthy*—\nWater’s mirroring reveals objects,\nBeauty and ugliness without losing their form.\nKindness in speech,\nFrom beginning to end, does not depart from truth.\n\n*Governance’s virtue is rectitude*—\nGreat peace is unmatched by stagnant water’s neutrality,\nNor does it surpass the virtue of the people.\n*Matters of virtue are accomplished*—\nWater’s lack of contrivance does not hinder its purpose—\nWhy then cannot the *Dao*-cultigating person achieve all things?\n\n*Action’s virtue is timely*—\nWater freezes in winter, overflows in summer,\nNever straying from its proper season.\nThe virtuous act in accordance with the times,\nNever failing in what is appropriate.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\nIs there no resentment.\nWater itself has no intention—\nIf a person empties themselves,\nNot contending with things,\nNaturally there is no fault.\n\n**Chapter Nine**\n*Fulfilling what is held*—\nTo hold and overflow is not as good as *its already* (*已*).」\n\n**Chapter Ten**\nThe *qi*-vessel tilts when full and must topple,\nExcessive indulgence reaches its limit and must fail.\nIf one wishes neither to topple nor fail,\nOnly the unarrogant and unfilled endure.\n\nSharpened by comparison, it cannot long persist.\nHonored, it invites criticism; austere, it invites censure.\nWith sharp resolve to stand apart,\nOne becomes the object of others’ scorn—\nDifficult to long endure.\n\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them.\nGold and jade without feet flow freely on their own.\nDisasters of water and fire, none can repel.\nBandits come—difficult to defend against.\nThus, the greedy who hoard lose *virtue*,\nWhile those who accumulate and then disperse align with the *Dao*.\n\nRich and noble yet proud—\nThey invite their own ruin.\nWealth piled but not dispersed,\nUsing nobility to oppress others.\nFault arises from within, not from without.\n\nWhen achievement is complete, name secured, step back—\nThe *Dao*’s way.\nYin and yang succeed one another,\nCool and warm shift in turn—\nThings have no fixed principle;\nThis is the constant *Dao* of Heaven.\nIf one clings to honor and does not withdraw,\nDestruction is inevitable—\nThus the *Er Chu* discerned the signs.\nThe Four Recluses departed in their wisdom,\nUnderstanding the principles of things,\nIn harmony with Heaven’s *Dao*.\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\n*Carrying the spirit-essence, embracing the One*—\nCan one remain undivided?\n*Carrying*—to govern.\n*Camp*—to protect.\n*Essence*—the body’s spirit.\n*One*—the *Dao*.\nHumans are the spirit’s chariot—hence *carrying*.\nA pure body calms the spirit-essence,\nA turbid heart drives away the true spirit.\nSevering thought to guard the spirit—hence *camp*.\nThe heart unclouded, undivided—hence *One*.\nWhen wisdom aligns with the *Dao*,\nSpirit and form unite—\nThus it is said: undivided.\n\n*Concentrating qi to attain softness*—\nCan one be like an infant?\nA unified body and heart are pure and undispersed—\nConcentrating qi.\nObtaining the *Dao* of longevity—\nAttaining softness.\nUnknowing the union of yin and yang,\nWithout clinging to right and wrong,\nOne can be like an infant.\n\n*Purifying and gazing into the mysterious*—\nCan one remain flawless?\nBathing in the *Dao*’s flow to cleanse the heart—*purifying*.\nWafting the numinous wind to dispel burdens—*cleansing*.\nInner and outer round and tranquil,\nLike water’s clear stillness.\nExterior and interior pure and bright,\nFree of blemish like jade and pearl.\n\n*Loving people, governing the state*—\nCan one act without action?\nIn high station yet unable to transform oneself,\nOne relies on others.\nTransforming things and people,\nAffairs depend on tranquility.\nBut those who act with agitation harm things,\nWhile those who act without action love people.\n\n*Heaven’s gates opening and closing*—\nCan one be receptive?\nHeaven has four seasonal gates:\nThe Azure Gate opens—warmth arrives,\nThe Vermilion Gate opens—heat arrives,\nThe White Gate opens—coolness arrives,\nThe Black Gate opens—cold arrives.\nNow the petty folk complain of summer’s heat and winter’s cold—\nThis is inability to be tranquil.\n*Closing*—to shut.\nOne gate opens while three close—\nReceptive tranquility.\nThe Sage’s spirit condenses in the Great Void,\nWisdom stilled in the Empty Mystery.\nLife and death, failure and success cannot disturb,\nFire and water, cold and heat cannot move.\nIlluminated in all directions,\nCan one remain without knowing?\n\nThe Sage’s wisdom encompasses all things,\nClarity equal to the two luminaries,\nIlluminating the four quarters—\nFourfold illumination.\nIlluminating yet ever still,\nShining yet not blazing,\nAbandoning perception, blending the heart—\nCan one remain without knowing?\n\n*Nurturing and preserving*—\nThe *Dao* gives birth, *virtue* nourishes.\nThe Sage aligns with the *Dao*’s birth and nurturing,\nGuiding the black-haired masses in pure transformation,\nNourishing all creatures in their natural state.\nGiving birth yet not possessing,\nActing yet not relying,\nGoverning yet not dominating—\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\nForgotten are merit and *virtue*—\nThe highest *virtue* is without *virtue*,\nThus it has *virtue*.\nForgotten *virtue*’s *virtue*,\nDeep and far-reaching—\nHence *Mysterious*.\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate.\nThough eyes can see, indulging in color without end\nLoses their brightness.\nThough ears can hear, wallowing in sound without rest\nLoses their acuity.\nThough the mouth can taste, probing flavors exhausts\nTheir nourishment.\n*Dull*—to lose.\nYet blindness is justified by not seeing,\nDeafness by not hearing.\nHaving eyes yet not seeing—\nThe True Person, the Great Sage, is blind.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\nTo have ears yet not hear the vast *Dao*’s subtle music—\nThis is deafness to the soul’s refined sound.\nThe mouth’s use lies in knowing taste,\nYet if one craves vulgar flavors, one strays from the *Way*—\nThus, *taste* is called *dull*.\n\nChasing hunts across fields drives the heart to madness.\nTo indulge in fowling and fishing,\n*Taikang* abandons his duties,\nZhang Yi falls ill from hunting fame—\nThis is the height of madness.\n\nRare treasures bring obstruction to one’s path.\nBeautiful women and precious gems—\nThese are rare.\nTo let them disrupt the heart\nIs to harm one’s conduct.\nThus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes,\nAnd so discards the one to take the other.\n\nTo empty the heart yet fill the inner self—\nThis is nourishing the belly.\nTo listen in reverse yet not be blind—\nThis is not indulging the eyes.\n\nBurdensome deeds are cast aside,\nThe *Way* of *wuwei* is embraced.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\nWhat cannot be seen is called *Yi*:\nThe *Dao* is distant—\nThe eye cannot perceive it,\nYet the Sage embodies it,\nAnd alone comprehends its clarity.\nThus it is called *Yi*.\n*Yi*—level, unobstructed.\n\nWhat cannot be heard is called *Xi*:\nThe great sound is subtle,\nBeyond the ear’s reach,\nYet the Sage penetrates it,\nAnd alone hears its harmony.\nThus it is called *Xi*.\nMysterious teaching is rare—\nSubtle speech, natural.\n\nWhat cannot be grasped is called *Wei*:\nThe great form has no shape,\nUnattainable to touch.\nThe Sage’s profound insight\nPierces the void’s essence.\nThus it is called *Wei*.\n*Wei*—mechanism, emptiness.\nResponding to things—mechanism.\nBeyond all names—emptiness.\n\nThese three cannot be questioned,\nThus they merge into one.\n*Xi, Wei, Yi*—three in essence.\nNeither sound nor color,\nNor form nor name,\nNeither presence nor absence suffices to define,\nNor length nor breadth can be measured.\nMingled chaos, undivided,\nNamed as one.\n\nOne is not one—\nBecause of the three, it is one.\nThree is not three—\nBecause of the one, it is three.\nFrom one comes three—\nThree is one and three.\nFrom three comes one—\nOne is three and one.\nOne does not complete one,\nThree is one and three.\nThree does not complete three—\nThree is not three.\nOne does not complete one—\nOne is not one.\n\nWithout one, without three,\nThis is the logic of forgotten speech.\nClinging to three or one\nObstructs the fluidity of the Mysterious Teaching.\n\nAbove, it is not bright,\nBelow, it is not dark.\nVast and boundless—\nIt cannot be named.\nBright—illuminated.\nDark—obscured.\nVast—unfettered, unrestrained.\n\nRiding the ten thousand things yet unattached,\nThe Supreme *Dao* is neither bright nor dark,\nCannot be named by light or shadow,\nNor perceived by sight or hearing.\nThe principles of *Xi* and *Yi*,\nHaving silenced the three and one,\nTranscend all existence—\nThus it returns to *wu*.\n\n*Wu*—nothingness, nothing to return to.\nTo know nothingness is to know nothing.\nThis is the Mysterious beyond the Mysterious,\nDiscarded yet again.\n\nThis is the form of the formless,\nThe image of the imageless—\nThis is called *hūhuang*.\n\nTo transcend existence and return to nothingness,\nNothingness has no form—\nTo perceive *Xi* and *Yi* through sight and hearing,\nYet *Xi* and *Yi* return to stillness,\nLest the bewildered fail to awaken,\nAnd cling only to the formless,\nShowing the lost the way home.\n\nTo open the form of the formless—\nThis arises from essence’s function,\nThe image of nothingness—\nThis is the cessation of response, returning to truth.\n\nTo cease response and return to truth\nIs to gather traces and restore the root.\nFrom essence’s function arises motion—\nStillness’s motion—\nSpeak of it as *wu*—\nYet suddenly, there is.\nTo gather traces and restore the root—\nSpeak of it as *you*—\nYet suddenly, there is not.\n\nSuddenly not—\nThis is only fixed *wu*.\nSuddenly yes—\nThis is only fixed *you*.\nThe fluctuating *you* and *wu*—\nNo name can contain it.\n\nApproach and you see no head,\nFollow and you see no tail.\n*You*—it has a front to meet.\n*Wu*—it has no rear to chase.\nTo approach and see nothing—\nThis is not *you*.\nTo follow and see nothing—\nThis is not *wu*.\n\nThe ancient Dao is held to govern the present’s *you*.\nGovern—this is to rectify.\nThe ancient Dao is rectified by *wu*—\nThe present Dao is perverse by *you*.\n\nThe Sage upholds the Dao of *wu*\nTo rectify the *you* of action,\nTo cease the frivolous and thin,\nAnd restore the pure and harmonious transformation.\n\nTo know the ancient beginning—\nThis is called the Dao’s foundation.\n\nThe mysterious ancient Dao is hard to know,\nThe *wu*’s wind is rarely awakened.\nThe superior governs the inferior with rectitude,\nThe inferior follows the superior with reverence.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\nThe ancients who excelled as scholars\nWere subtle, mysterious, and penetrating,\nDeep beyond recognition.\n\nThe Dao of old was hard to walk,\nYet the wise of antiquity could cultivate it.\nThe Dao is subtle, essential, and wondrous,\nMysterious, still, and empty—\nIts practice is extreme, reaching the utmost subtlety,\nUnobstructed, with no stagnation.\n\nWhen practice aligns with the Dao,\nIt is unfathomable and hard to know.\nIt cannot be spoken of with words—\nHe who speaks of it does not grasp the Dao;\nIt cannot be recognized with recognition—\nHe who recognizes it strays from truth.\nThus it is said: *It cannot be recognized.*\n\nSince it cannot be recognized,\nWe forcefully give it form—\nForm, meaning appearance.\nThe Dao is hard to ponder,\nIts practice hard to discern—\nFearful that later scholars may lack the means to embody the Dao,\nStudents may not know how to establish and walk it,\nBelow, we briefly outline its appearances\nTo encourage and exhort.\n\nLike one crossing a river in winter—\nStepping on thin ice,\nFearful of sinking into the depths,\nThe living fear danger,\nTrembling, not daring to act wrongly,\nDiligently knowing only to advance on the Dao.\n\nLike one fearing the neighbors—\nIn the midst of the world, acting wickedly,\nStartled by the neighbors’ warnings to awaken,\nResolving to follow the Dao and do good,\nFearful of the consequences in both life and death,\nTo be reproached by both the living and the dead.\n\nSolemn in appearance—\nIn appearance, only to quietly cultivate the Dao,\nNot to move recklessly.\n\nDissolving like ice about to melt—\nOn a fine spring day, the ice thaws,\nThe mysterious wind rises, and burdens dissolve.\n\nPlain like uncarved wood—\nThick without being thin,\nSubstantial without being ornate.\n\nVast like a valley—\nThe valley’s emptiness\nHolds all things and responds to sound.\nThe heart’s emptiness\nEmbraces the Dao and aids the world.\n\nMixed like turbid water—\nThe heart without distinction—mixed.\nIn harmony with the world—turbid.\nHolding jade without stain,\nClutching a pearl, self-luminous—\nYet appearing turbid.\nWho can, through stillness, gradually clarify the turbid?\nWho can, through tranquility, gradually bring forth life from motion?\nTranquility—stillness.\nGradually—slowly.\n\nTo still movement in the heart,\nThe spirit naturally becomes tranquil.\nTo not disturb the water,\nThe turbid naturally clears.\nFew practice this.\nThus it is said: *Who can?*\n\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\nAbove, we broadly expound on the Dao’s practice to encourage learners—\nIf one guards it, one attains clarity and stillness,\nHumbly retreating, not indulging in excess.\nOnly by not being full\nCan one be depleted and yet renewed.\n\nThose who establish themselves do not aspire to fullness,\nAssisting with loyalty and rectitude—\nThough aged, they return to youth,\nIn depletion, like rebirth.\n\nLearners of the Dao empty their hearts of sounds and colors,\nWash away worries and dissolve entanglements—\nThough in a decaying body and corrupt world,\nThey yet attain fulfillment in the true Dao.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\nTo perfect emptiness, to firmly hold stillness.\nIts nature is still and true,\nIts practice clear and distant.\nThose who guard it deeply\nMay attain the Dao of perfect emptiness.\n\nAll things arise together—\nCommon people cannot guard *wu*,\nTaking ease and stillness as the emotions’ movements,\nAbandoning truth for falsehood,\nLosing the root and chasing the branches.\nI observe their return.\n\nReturn—root.\nCommon people lose the root and chase the branches,\nAbandoning purity for frivolity.\nThe Sage suppresses the branches and honors the root,\nTurning frivolity back to simplicity.\n\nThings, teeming and diverse,\nEach return to their root.\nThings—also people.\nRoot—also the root.\nSpeaking of people with one heart clinging to myriad realms,\nTheir affairs are not singular—\nThus it is said: *teeming and diverse*.\nThe Sage all encourages returning to the root,\nThus it is said: *each return to their root*.\n\nReturning to the root is stillness,\nIn the branches, the wheel turns back to the root,\nMotionless and unmoving.\nStillness is called *returning to command*.\nNearly speaking, the strong and violent\nDo not meet their natural end—\nTheir names are cut short in mid-life.\nPreserving emptiness and stillness,\nOne attains the full span of life—\nThis is called *returning to command*.\n\nFarther spoken of, movement brings birth and death,\nLosing true nature.\nStillness brings neither death nor birth,\nReturning to the enlightened command.\n\nReturning to command is constancy—\nBirth and death are thus interrupted.\nNeither death nor birth—thus constancy.\nKnowing constancy is clarity.\nThose who are confused about this principle are dark,\nThose who awaken to this Dao are clear.\nNot knowing constancy—reckless action is calamitous.\nKnowing constancy and trusting the Dao—\nAll actions are auspicious,\nHeaven aids, people assist—\nThus it is said: *auspicious*.\nGoing against the Dao, following perversity,\nIndulging emotions and will—\nStumbling into error, acting improperly,\nMan and spirit condemn—\nThus it is said: *calamitous*.\n\nKnowing constancy is capacity—\nKnowing constancy, reaching principle,\nEqual to the void, containing all—\nThus it is called *capacity*.\nCapacity can be impartial.\nRectified without partiality.\nImpartiality can rule—\nPartiality cannot govern things,\nImpartiality naturally can reign supreme.\nRule can align with Heaven—\nBroad and heartless, moving in due season.\nHeaven can embody the Dao—\nIn harmony with Heaven and Earth in virtue,\nShared in the Dao, aligned in truth,\nUnobstructed and flowing,\nAll movement in accord with reason.\nThe Dao can endure—\nThe Dao has existed since ancient times,\nThe Sage enjoys eternal life without end.\nNo danger at the end of life—\nEnd—termination.\nAligned with Heaven, in accord with the Dao,\nEnding in this body,\nForever without peril.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\nThe Supreme Sage—\nThe inferior know of his existence.\nThe Supreme Sage—referring to the ruler of supreme virtue.\nVirtue, though not virtuous,\nIts name is hard to name—\nOnly that the Great Person is above,\nSpeaking of the Supreme Sage,\nThe superior embraces virtue and the Dao below,\nNeeding nothing from below,\nSelf-sufficient above,\nNothing to receive—\nRuler and subjects, superior and inferior,\nKnow only of his existence.\n\nThe next—\nHe is praised and honored.\nThe ruler of lesser virtue has traces of action,\nNot yet able to forget words.\nAbove, he is trusted by his subjects,\nBelow, he is praised by his superiors.\n\nThe next—\nHe is feared and insulted.\n\n---\n\n...unable to follow the transformations of all things,\nto allow nature’s essence to unfold naturally,\nand to establish laws and punishments to intimidate them—\nthus they speak of being feared.\n\nWith commands numerous, the people below grow insolent—\nthus they speak of being insulted.\n\nThis is the way of the ancient past.\n\nTrust is insufficient, so there is distrust.\nAs the ruler above,\nhe transforms through the Dao,\nhe demonstrates through trust.\n\nIf the ruler above trusts those below,\nthose below also trust the ruler above.\nIf the ruler above cannot trust those below,\nthose below do not trust the ruler above.\n\nYet he values words—\nthis is the time of the middle age.\n\nUnable to forget words,\nhe borrows speech to convey meaning,\nand they mutually flatter and praise each other—\nthus words become heavy.\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nthe people say, \"This is natural.\"\n\nThe Dao of the Emperor shines forth—\ndeeds accomplished,\nthe wind of non-action takes root—\naffairs fulfilled.\n\nHaving previously explained the three ancient stages,\nhe speaks of losing the Dao and then virtue,\nfrom purity to corruption—\nnow he restores the connection,\ndesiring to show the abandonment of benevolence and righteousness,\nto reverse corruption and return to purity.\n\nThe Dao is shallow and easily seen,\nvirtue is profound and hard to perceive.\nNow the Sage’s transformation is deep,\nhis divine power unfathomable,\nhis daily actions unknown—\nthus they speak of naturalness.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen**\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned,\nbenevolence and righteousness arise.\n\nIn the realm of *Zhongxuan* (重玄),\nthe *qi* and its manifestations cannot be kept private.\nIn the principle of utmost emptiness,\nthe void itself is insufficient to discuss.\n\nOne cannot welcome or follow it—\nwhat beginning, what end is there?\n\nFlourishing and decline show no change—\nwhat abandonment, what rise is there?\n\nIn days of pure simplicity,\nnear and far are not divided by closeness or distance,\nin hours of tranquil reverence,\nsuperior and inferior are not distinguished by rank.\n\nThe Dao and its manifestations align naturally,\nwithout need for binding cords or records,\nwalking the Great Way,\nhow could one rely on written contracts?\n\nWhen the times are in harmony with the One,\nthus they speak of the Dao’s flourishing.\n\nPracticing partial love as benevolence,\napplying censure of wrong as righteousness,\ncorruption and shallowness become the norm—\nunable to walk the Dao,\nthus they speak of its abandonment.\n\nThe times have purity and corruption,\nthe Dao has no rise or fall.\n\nWisdom emerges, and great deceit follows.\nDim and silent, the Dao’s ultimate state.\nObscured and murky, the practice’s utmost form.\n\nUnable to illuminate yet not dazzling—\nthus one knows that wisdom is adorned to startle the foolish,\nand disputes are vied to outdo others.\nDisputes arise in succession,\nand crafty deceits multiply.\nThe thief Zhi follows its rules as thievery,\nand the usurper Tian Cheng rides it to steal the state—\nthis is great deceit.\n\nWhen the six relations are not in harmony,\nfilial piety and kindness arise.\nFather and son, brothers, husband and wife—\nthe six relations.\nMutually dependent,\ndisputes do not arise.\nLong and short compared,\nlikes and dislikes then emerge.\nHarmony is marked by discord,\nfilial piety is named by unfilial acts.\n\nWhen the state is in chaos and disorder,\nloyal ministers appear.\nIn the age of Xu and Nong,\nno tales of the limbs’ devotion were heard.\nIn the days of Jie and Zhou,\nthe virtues of the loyal and upright were first praised.\n\nThus one knows:\nwhen the sun rises bright in the sky,\nthe stars cannot compete in their radiance;\nwhen the timely rains descend,\nthe fields cannot claim credit for their growth.\n\nIf the ruler above is benighted,\nand ministers below are disorderly,\nyet one who can internally assist his ruler\nand externally pacify the bandits\nemerges—\nthen the name of loyalty shines forth.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen**\nAbandoning the Sage, discarding wisdom,\nthe people gain a hundredfold benefit;\nthe Sage—\none whom the people revere;\nwisdom—\nwhat the foolish seek.\n\nWithout wisdom, how could one perceive the subtleties?\nWithout the Sage, how could one govern all things?\n\nNow he speaks of abandonment—\nthis has not been heard before.\n\nThe Sage aligns with the Dao,\nthe Dao itself has no name.\nWhen names arise, things become confused—\nspeaking of the Sage does not reach forgetting the Sage.\nWhen wisdom emerges, deceit follows—\nusing wisdom does not reach forgetting wisdom.\n\nThus it must be abandoned and discarded.\nYet when the Sage arises, thieves appear,\nand when wisdom is employed, robbers come.\nNow he speaks of abandonment—\nno thieves or robbers rise,\nits benefits are indeed great—\nbriefly speaking, a hundredfold.\n\nAbandoning benevolence, discarding righteousness,\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness;\nbenevolence—\nto love all things;\nrighteousness—\nto yield to others.\nThough called the Way to establish humanity,\nit is truly also a way to distort human nature.\n\nNow, discarding the distorting benevolence and righteousness,\nand returning to the natural filial piety and kindness.\n\nAbandoning cleverness, discarding profit,\nthieves and robbers will not exist.\nDiscarding the skillful hands of Gong and Tu,\nquieting the scheming heart—\nabandoning cleverness.\nDiscarding jade to shatter pearls,\nabandoning profit—\nthis is the way.\n\nYet thieves and robbers follow profit’s rules,\nand when profit is discarded,\nwho would steal?\nThese three—\nas for teaching, it is insufficient,\nthus they must be followed by later words.\nTeaching—\ninstruction.\nFollowing—\ncontinuation.\n\nThe Great Person’s instruction\nalways refines the common to reach the Sage,\nguides the foolish to wisdom,\nand removes harm to seek profit.\nNow all are discarded,\nand instruction is insufficient.\nThe unlearned do not know where to place their hearts—\nthus he continues with later words,\nto show how to establish and practice.\n\nSeeing simplicity, holding onto purity,\nfew private desires, little craving.\nPurity—\nthe root.\nUnstained by all phenomena—\nseeing simplicity.\nGuarding the One without deviation—\nholding onto purity.\nImpartial yet not cliquish—\nfew private desires.\nUsing nature to regulate emotions—\nlittle craving.\n\n**Chapter Twenty**\nAbandoning learning, there is no worry.\nAs for the mind’s alignment with the Dao of non-action,\nthen learning has nothing to learn,\nblending the foolish with the wise,\nthen gains and losses are unheard,\nembracing forgetfulness in advance and retreat,\nthen honor and disgrace do not alarm.\n\nHolding onto nature and aligning with the Dao,\nhow could there be worry?\n\nOnly those who preserve the affairs of action,\nlearning is not for oneself—\nthose who hang their heads and pierce their thighs to compete are called scholars,\nthose who study by candlelight and gather fireflies vie for profit—\nfearing that honorable names will not be established,\nand dreading that great profits will not come,\nwith this in mind,\nworries and troubles arise.\n\nHow far apart are *Zhi* (之) and *A* (阿)?\nHow different are good and evil?\n*Zhi* and *A* are paired in ritual,\nthe wilds respond with *A*.\nTo conform is called good,\nto oppose is called evil.\nNot far—\nspeaking of their nearness.\n\nTo embody the Dao,\nall deliberations are forgotten,\nto follow truth,\nall paths are suitable.\nTruly, there is neither opposition nor compliance,\nneither praise nor blame—\nyet those who act forcefully\ngive rise to false distinctions and partiality,\narbitrarily fostering likes and dislikes,\nnot keeping their hearts in the realm of virtue and the Dao,\nonly blaming others with shallow and refined rituals,\ncalling conformity to the heart \"good,\"\nwithout asking whether they are virtuous or not—\n\n「When one polishes oneself and calls it *ability*,\nwithout considering wisdom or its absence.\nThis is how the wise become obscured in folly,\nand the virtuous become inverted in ignorance.\nThus it is said: *How close they are*—\nalso saying that human nature is naturally self-sufficient,\nand adding to it breeds sorrow.\n\nTo advance wisdom for the sake of reputation,\nor to adorn falsehood as evil,\nthough their purposes differ,\nboth lose their true nature.\nThus it is said: *How close they are*—\n\nWhat people fear,\none must fear—\nhow vast and unending is this dread!\nWater and fire are to be feared,\nyet not fearing them leads only to burning and drowning.\nWolves and tigers are to be feared,\nyet not fearing them brings only harm and injury.\nThus, when people indulge in likes and dislikes without restraint,\nthey return to ruin and defeat;\nwhen they covet fame and profit without end,\nthey invite danger and annihilation.\n\nNow, the common folk are long ensnared,\ndrowned and forgetful of return.\nThey drift aimlessly, with no end in sight—\nthe multitude bustling like feasts of *Tai Lao* [great sacrificial meat],\nascending spring platforms like revelers in bloom.\n*Familiar bustling*—joy and delight.\n*Tai Lao*—flavor,\n*Spring platform*—color.\nThe common folk pursue learning to shape reputation,\nindulge passions to cloud the senses with color and taste.\nThey delight in color,\nyet know not that blindness has its time;\nthey gratify the mouth,\nyet know not that satisfaction will fade.\nChasing desires grows old yet overflows evermore,\nexhausting the body without rest,\nstill they take pride,\ncalling it joy and delight.\n\nI alone am fearful—\nbefore signs appear,\nlike an infant yet to know childhood.\n*Drifting and unmoored*—\nas if without destination.\nThe Sage speaks of the common folk racing through the realm of *doing*,\nmoved by sounds and colors,\nwhile I abide in the stillness of *non-doing*,\nunperturbed by fragrance or flavor.\n\nLike the unspoiled babe,\nunaware of the union of male and female,\nunknowing of lustful desires,\nthe heart has no attachment—\nhow could it be fixed to any destination?\nThe common folk all have excess,\nwhile I alone seem abandoned.\nThe vulgar cling to purity and emptiness yet lack it,\ndwelling in turbidity and filth yet have abundance—\namassing wealth as external burden,\ngiving free rein to desires to deepen inner defilement.\n\nThe Sage is unstained by dust and filth,\ncasting aside worldly affairs entirely,\nthus it is said: *as if abandoned*.\n\nMy heart is that of a simple fool—\n*simple and pure*.\nThe vulgar are foolish,\nyet deem themselves wise,\nbewildered by emotions and desires,\nsoiled and disordered day by day.\n\nThe Sage’s great wisdom seems like folly,\nform and spirit serene and empty,\npure and white day by day.\nThe vulgar are *bright and clear*,\nyet unaware that true wisdom is not mere eloquence—\ninner clarity of heart,\nouter radiance in things,\nself-proclaimed as knowing and discerning,\nthus it is said: *bright and clear*.\n\nI alone seem *dim and dull*—\nknowing yet appearing ignorant,\nas if veiled in darkness.\nThe vulgar are *sharp and keen*,\nfixated on the realm of right and wrong,\nconcentrating on the paths of gain and loss.\n\nI alone am *obscured and tranquil*—\nabandoning heart and mind,\nfree from distinctions,\nforgetting good and evil,\nthus it is said: *obscured and tranquil*.\n\nDiluted like the sea,\ndrifting without end.\nThe expanse of *virtue* is vast,\nthe heart’s platform serene—\nlike the great sea stirred by winds,\nwaves rise and fall,\ndrifting east and west,\nyet never fixed in place.\nThe common folk all have *means*—\nthey rely on *doing*.」\n\nI alone seem crude and vulgar—\nlike the ignorant fool, unadorned like the lowly.\nI alone differ from others,\nyet cherish *Dao* as my nourishing Mother.\nFood is *use*; Mother is *Way*.\nAll seek fulfillment,\nyet none yet speak of it.\nWhen things lose their *principle*,\nthe Sage establishes teaching.\nFrom Spring Terrace downward,\nall are the afflictions of sentient beings’ *doing*.\nThe Sage follows illness to heal,\nprescribing *wuwei* as medicine.\nIllness and *doing* differ,\n*wuwei* and *having* differ—\nthus the distinction in speech.\n\nThe vulgar, mired in convention,\nthe Sage uses *Dao*—\nthus it is said: *nourished by Mother*.\n\n---\n**Chapter XXI**\nThe vastness of *virtue’s* bearing,\nfollows only *Dao*.\n*Kong* means \"great,\" \"most.\"\n*Dao* is *principle*.\n*Virtue* encompasses all things—\nthus it is said: *bearing*.\nAll movement aligns with *principle*—\nthus it is said: *follows*.\nIt is also said: *great virtue*\ndoes not come from elsewhere,\nonly from *Dao*.\n\n*Dao* as thing—\nonly hazy, only vague.\nNot yet knowing what it is,\nyet *virtue* shines forth.\nThe Great *Way* is profound and mysterious,\ntoo deep to fathom.\nSpeak of its *non-being*,\nyet it forms the mixed whole;\nspeak of its *being*,\nyet it returns to nothingness.\nReturning to nothingness yet not lacking,\nspeaking of something yet not absent—\n*being* and *non-being* are not constant,\nlife and death are not fixed—\nthus it is said: *hazy and vague*.\nWithin hazy vagueness, there is form;\nwithin vague haziness, there is substance.\nThe true of neither *being* nor *non-being*,\nthe most profound, most mysterious *Way*—\nsplitting the One to open the Three *Images*,\nharmonizing the Two *qi* to birth ten thousand things.\n\nIn the dim and dark, there is essence.\nThe ultimate *principle* is singular—\nthus it is said: *essence*.\nThe wondrous body is unchanging—\nthus it is said: *true*.\nIts essence is most true,\nand within it, there is *faith*.\nSilent without form,\nyet responsive and penetrating.\nRewarding the good, punishing licentiousness—\nits influence is ever-present.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nits name does not fade,\njudging all beginnings.\n*Yue* means \"simplify\"; *fu* means \"beginning.\"\nThe ignorant lack knowledge,\nthe vulgar are mired in delusion,\nclaiming the dim and dark *principle*\nis originally severed from cause and effect,\nthat within hazy vagueness,\nthere is no karma—\nthus the virtuous grow slack,\nthe wicked do not repent.\nNot recognizing essence as sacred,\nhow could they know truth as real?\nIt is said: *within it, there is faith*,\nto illuminate *principle* as not empty,\nto save all beings by prescribing teachings,\nfrom end to beginning,\nsimplifying causes of good and evil.\nFrom ancient times to now,\njudging deeds of vice and rectitude.\nThe loyal and filial are rewarded with rank,\nthe transgressors punished with law.\nEmbracing both emptiness and substance,\npervading the cosmos,\nits body stands independent,\nyet its name endures—\nserene and unceasing.\nHow do I know all beginnings are thus?\nBy this.\n\nHow do I know the Great *Way*\nfrom ancient times to now,\njudging all things from end to beginning,\ndistinguishing among people,\nfreeing the four births and three ages without loss?\nOnly by observing the present,\ncan one know past and future.\n\n---\n**Chapter XXII**\nBend and you are whole;\ncrooked and you are straight.\nHollow and you are full;\nworn and you are new.\nFew and you gain;\nmany and you are confused.\nOuter conformity to inner harmony,\ninner nourishment of spirit—\nharmony with things—*whole*.\nBow to others, yet your body does not stray from *Dao*—*straight*.\nRetiring to lowliness—*hollow*.\nMixed yet not turbid—*new*.\n*Principle* is originally one—\nthus it is said: *few*.\nForgetting speech aligns with *principle*—\nthus it is said: *gain*.\n*Doing* creates myriad teachings and doctrines;\nmany scholars chase desires, minds in turmoil,\nlost in teachings, mired in delusion—\nthus it is said: *confused*.\n\nTherefore, the Sage embraces *One* as the model for all under heaven.\n*One* is *Dao*.\nThe Sage cherishes *Dao*—\nthus it is said: *embraces One*.\nAll movement aligns with *principle*,\ncan govern things—\nthus it is said: *model*.\nNot self-assertive, thus clear;\nnot self-righteous, thus manifest;\nnot self-praising, thus effective;\nnot self-conceited, thus enduring.\nAbandoning distinctions, forgetting mind,\nwisdom shines forth.\nDiscarding *self* and *other*, preserving truth,\n*virtue* becomes manifest.\nClaiming merit yet losing it,\nboasting of *virtue* yet not enduring.\n\nOnly the non-contending\ncannot be contended with.\nClaiming *I* am right,\npointing to others as wrong—\nunable to follow others,\nonly knowing to oppose things—\ncontention arises.\nThe Sage bends to follow things,\ntranscends right and wrong,\ndoes not vie for merit and fame,\ncompetes with none—\nthus, though the world be vast,\nwho could contend?\n\nWas it not said of old:\n*\"Bend and you are whole\"*?\nTruly whole, returning to it.\nThe Sage does not monopolize,\nspeaking through antiquity.\nCrooked and straight, few and gain—\nnot empty words,\ntruly whole, returning to the body—\nall are true records.\n\n---\n**Chapter XXIII**\nFew words, natural.\n*Xi* means \"few.\"\nMany words exhaust meaning;\nfew words align with *Dao*—\nthus it is said: *natural*.\n*Dao* is neither *non-being* nor *being*,\n*principle* is neither few nor many.\nTo clarify the error of many words,\nborrow few words to align with *Dao*.\n\nA gust does not last the morning,\na sudden rain does not last the day.\nSwift winds and violent rains\nstill do not span day or morning—\nlight and hasty speech,\nhow could it preserve the body and avoid harm?\nFew words align with *principle*—\nthen ten days of rain, five days of wind.\nMany words bring damage—\nthen raging winds and torrential rains.\nWho does this?\nAsk the heavens and earth.\nEven they cannot endure—\nhow much less humans?\nThis uses the great to explain the small.\n\nThus, those who practice *Dao*:\nthose aligned with *Dao* gain *Dao*.\nThose who practice *Dao* are pure, empty, and *wuwei*,\nsaving people and benefiting things—\nif all actions follow *Dao*,\n*Dao* is gained.\nThose aligned with *virtue* gain *virtue*.\n*Virtue* nurtures things,\nbenefits people—\nif people act in accord with *virtue*,\n*virtue* is gained by people.\nThose aligned with loss lose *Dao*.\nThose who practice *Dao* lose it.\n\n---\n\nThe unaligned cannot embody *virtue* and *Dao*,\nnor preserve the essence of transformation and *principle*.\nTo conspire with evil is to act against *Dao*;\nto share in guilt is to suffer punishment.\n\nWhen trust is insufficient, distrust arises.\nThose aligned with *Dao* gain *Dao*;\nthose faithful to *virtue* gain *virtue*.\nThose aligned with loss lose *Dao*—\nwhen trust is insufficient, distrust arises.\n\n**Chapter XXIV**\nThose who stand on tiptoe cannot stand firm;\nthose who stride cannot walk steadily.\n*Stride* means to overreach.\nSlow steps and measured pace endure long.\nTiptoeing and overreaching divide the stride—\nsuch steps do not endure long.\nThis illustrates that humility, modesty, and yielding endure,\nwhile arrogance and self-aggrandizement bring peril and ruin.\n\nSelf-display brings no clarity,\nself-righteousness no brilliance,\nself-praise no merit.\nSelf-aggrandizement does not last.\nThis is not the conduct of a *junzi*—\nhow much less the forgetful scholar?\n\nIn *Dao*, it is called surplus food and superfluous actions.\nThough some may detest it, those who practice *Dao* do not dwell there.\nSurplus food cannot be offered in sacrifice.\nOverreaching steps cannot advance *Dao*.\nThe confused love such conduct as correct,\nwhile the enlightened reject it as false—\nthus they do not dwell there.\n\n**Chapter XXV**\nThere is a thing that blends and forms,\nborn before Heaven and Earth.\n*The thing* is *Dao*—\nthus it is said to be a thing.\nYet *Dao* as a thing is vague and indistinct,\nneither to be affirmed nor denied in terms of existence,\nnor to be debated as yin or yang.\nMingled and formless, it arises naturally—\nthus it is called *blended and formed*.\n\nBy natural principle, it moves through transformation,\nwithin the formless, opening through *qi* and phenomena.\nIts origin precedes Heaven and Earth’s birth.\nSilent and vast, it stands alone and unchanging,\ncirculating endlessly without exhaustion—\nit can be the mother of all under Heaven.\n\n*Blended and formed*, *Dao* precedes Heaven and Earth’s birth.\nListen, and no sound—silent and vast, no echo.\nGrasp, and nothing—dim and boundless, no form.\nIt loses its pair and has no counterpart—\nthus it is said to stand alone.\nDeep and enduring, it ever exists—\nthus it is said unchanging.\nIt is nowhere absent—\nthus it circulates.\nTo use it is effortless, without exhaustion.\nCovering and nurturing all things—\nthis is its maternal role.\n\nI do not know its name—\nI call it *Dao*.\nI force a name upon it—*Great*.\nHeaven, when shaped, is named;\nwhen formless, it is nameless.\nApproximating the origin of life for use,\nit is called *Dao*.\nIt encompasses all without singular law—\nthus it is called *Great*.\nPrinciple has no name;\nnameless, yet named—\nthis is called *forcing*.\n\n*Great* is called *Passing*,\n*Passing* is called *Distant*,\n*Distant* is called *Returning*.\n*Passing* means to go.\nTo seek *Great* is to find no going;\nto pursue *Passing* is to fail to reach *Distant*.\nIts essence is near within oneself—\nthus it is called *Returning*.\n\nThus *Dao* is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great,\nand the Sovereign is great.\n*Dao* is honored, *virtue* is precious—\nspanning all without limit.\nHeaven can broadly cover,\nwithout distinction between noble and base.\nEarth can deeply bear,\nwithout preference for beauty or ugliness.\nThe Sovereign controls,\npenetrating far and near.\nNurturing and equalizing the poor and rich,\neach with its proper use—\nthis is spoken of as *Great*.\n\nWithin the realm, there are four *Greats*,\nand the Sovereign occupies one.\nBeyond the world’s bounds,\nwords may cease.\nWithin form and image,\nprinciple generates names.\nThough countless things exist,\nultimately there are only four *Greats*.\nSince the name *Great* is singular,\nits applications differ in meaning.\nTo exhort the Sovereign to embrace *Dao* and *virtue*,\nand take Heaven and Earth as models—\n\nHumans model Earth,\nEarth models Heaven,\nHeaven models *Dao*,\n*Dao* models Nature.\n\nThe Sovereign, in stillness, aligns with yin’s *virtue*,\nhis intentions unselfish—\nthis models Earth.\nIn action, he aligns with yang’s movement,\nhis governance public and just—\nthis models Heaven.\nClear, empty, and *wuwei*,\nhis actions flow without obstruction,\nall movement in accord with principle—\nthis models *Dao*.\nThe Sage has no desires beyond attending to affairs,\nemptying himself of schemes and managing things,\nhis purpose returning to spontaneous transformation—\nthis models Nature.\n\nThis is modeling Heaven and Earth,\nnot Heaven and Earth modeling each other.\n\n**Chapter XXVI**\nWeight is the root of lightness,\nstillness the master of agitation.\nIf both great and small are light,\nthey cannot serve as roots.\nIf both high and low are agitated,\nthey cannot serve as rulers.\nThus, one light and one heavy—\nthe light relies on the heavy as root.\nOne agitated and one still—\nthe agitated relies on the still as master.\n\nTherefore, *wuwei* and stillness are the *virtue* of the ruler.\nAction and agitation are the duties of the minister.\nAbove and below each attend to their roles—\nthe ruler must prioritize stillness and weight.\n\nThus the *junzi* moves all day without leaving his carriage.\nThe enlightened ruler, governing people and things,\nstrives for stillness and weight,\nnever light or agitated,\nnever straying from *Dao*,\nnever departing from stillness.\nThus his movement is with the carriage,\nhis dwelling with guards.\nHe does not reach peril and ruin—\nthis is the power of stillness and weight.\n\nThough adorned with splendor,\nhe dwells aloof and untroubled.\nWhat the Sage values,\nwhat *Dao* treasures,\nis stillness and weight.\nThough adorned with jade halls and palaces of beauty,\nhis true dwelling is emptiness and silence.\nThough surrounded by beauty like Naoji and Feiyan,\nhis mind dwells in *wuwei*.\nDesires cannot burden him,\nluxury cannot deceive him.\nUnencumbered by things,\nthus he is untroubled.\n\nHow can the Sovereign of ten thousand chariots\nmake his body lighter than the world?\nThe son of a thousand gold,\nsits not on the edge of the hall.\nThe Sovereign of ten thousand chariots—\nhow can he move recklessly?\nLightness loses ministers,\nagitation loses the ruler.\nEarlier, stillness and weight were praised—\nthus he is untroubled and unburdened.\nNow, lightness and agitation are warned against—\nthus harm must follow.\nUnburdened, ruler and ministers are at ease;\nharmed, both ruler and ministers are lost.\n\n**Chapter XXVII**\nGood conduct leaves no traces.\nThe seven-scented carriage gliding over water—\nits movement leaves tracks.\nThe thousand-*li* horse leaping through clouds—\nits strides leave marks.\n\nThe Sage moves without haste yet swiftly,\nthe cloud-carriage glides without treading the earth.\nHe arrives without traveling,\nthe phoenix-bird leaves no trace behind.\n\nWhen the Sage governs with hands at rest,\nno wheels mark the halls of state.\nThe virtuous man fades into silence,\nno footprints scar the hills and valleys of Confucius.\n\nGood speech leaves no blemish.\nWhen words are spoken, they strike true—\na thousand *li* responds.\nWithout law, no speech is given—\nwhat fault could there be?\n\nGood planning requires no tally-sticks.\nTally-sticks count things by number,\nbut through the Dao, all things are already complete—\nwhy use numbers?\n\nGood closure needs no bolt or bar to seal,\nyet cannot be opened.\nDoors may be barred or unbarred,\nbut if governed by the Dao,\nthere is no closing—\nnor any opening.\n\nThus, the ruler of the realm governs the people with the Dao,\nleaving no way for spies to peer.\nThe cultivator refines himself with the Dao,\nleaving no path for desires to breach.\n\nGood binding needs no rope or knot to tie,\nyet cannot be undone.\nThose who bind with ropes know of tying and untying,\nbut if the Dao governs the four quarters,\nthis is true binding.\nAll under heaven unite beneath one—\nit cannot be undone.\n\nThe cultivator must align with the Dao,\nthus it is said: good binding.\nHolding to One without separation,\nit cannot be undone.\n\nTherefore, the Sage is always good at saving people,\nand so no one is abandoned.\nWhen one thing loses its place,\nhis heart aches with care—\nhe views all as his children.\nHow could there be abandonment?\n\nThe True Sage expounds the scriptures to enlighten,\nresponds to karmic impulses to guide the common,\nand rescues with the Dao—\nnever leaving any behind.\nAlways good at saving things,\nthus nothing is abandoned.\nFrom beginning to end, the Dao is applied—\nthus it is said: always good.\n\nJoy reaches all under heaven—\nthus it is said: good.\nVirtue can broadly rescue—\nthus it is said: save.\nSpeaking of all things—\nthus it is said: things.\nThis is called *Clothing the Bright*.\n\nPracticing these five virtues,\nboth people and things are rescued.\nFollowing the Dao and applying it—\nthis is called *Clothing the Bright*.\n\nThe good man is the teacher of the unvirtuous.\nThe unvirtuous are the resources of the good.\nWhen conduct aligns with the Dao,\nvirtue can benefit others—\nthis is the good man.\nThe model for all people,\nthe standard for all things—\nthis is the teacher.\nThe dim seek the bright,\nthe bright do not seek the dim.\nThey receive them to serve,\nand provide them with offerings—\nthese are resources.\nIf one does not honor the teacher,\nnor cherish the resources,\nthough one may know great confusion,\nthis is called the *Essential Mystery*.\n\nTo revere the teacher and honor the Dao—\nthis is honor.\nTo be kind and persuasive—\nthis is love.\nThe meaning of resources demands honor and love,\nbut if the teacher does not love the resources,\nthe dark flow is blocked and does not nourish,\nand the resources do not honor the teacher.\nThe path of kindness is difficult to return—\nthe enlightened grasp this mystery,\nthe benighted fall into great confusion.\n\n**Chapter XXVIII**\nKnowing the雄 yet guarding the雌,\none becomes the valley of all under heaven.\nNot flattering, not arrogant,\ndwelling in moderation—\nthis is the conduct of the gentleman.\nNot still, not agitated,\ndwelling in harmony—\nthis is the foundation of the Dao.\n\nThus, those who harbor雄 and fierce intentions\ncannot be fully true.\nThose who embrace雌 and yielding nature\ncannot aspire to the Dao.\nNow, knowing one’s雄 nature yet guarding the雌,\none neither agitates nor acts hastily.\nSimilarly, knowing one’s雌 nature yet guarding the雄,\none neither stagnates nor delays—\navoiding extremes, naturally aligning with the Middle Way.\n\nYet those who act with雄 and fierceness are many,\nwhile those who guard雌 and yielding are few.\nThus, the analogy: the Han River and valleys dwell low,\nand all streams flow toward them.\nThe virtuous and refined retreat in humility,\nand morality flows to them.\nConstant virtue never departs,\nreturning to the infant’s state.\nWithin, no distinctions or judgments—\nthis is the conduct of the innocent child.\nIf one can always guard stillness,\nconstantly aligning with virtue,\nthis is not departing.\n\nSmall things lack emotion,\ngreat things have desires—\nabandoning the great awareness of maturity,\nreturning to the childlike ignorance of infancy—\nthus it is said: returning.\n\nKnowing the white yet guarding the black,\none becomes the model for all under heaven.\nGreat whiteness seems like disgrace,\ngreat wisdom seems like folly—\nretiring to preserve oneself,\nthis is the law.\n\nConstant virtue does not err,\nreturning to the boundless.\n*Err* means to deviate—\nnot to dazzle others with wisdom,\nnot to harm oneself for fame,\nthough inwardly pure,\nexternally appearing as dust.\nHe who establishes himself receives boundless blessings,\nhe who cultivates the Dao attains the boundless.\n\nKnowing honor yet guarding disgrace,\none becomes the valley of all under heaven.\nHolding office and rank—honor.\nHaving no position, no name—disgrace.\nIf one can know how to dwell in display without arrogance,\nand guard humiliation with humility,\nthis is to contain all things,\nbecoming the valley of all under heaven.\n\nTo be the valley of all under heaven,\nconstant virtue is sufficient,\nreturning to simplicity.\nIn nobility, act as the humble;\nin honor, appear as the disgraced—\nthe true and constant virtue naturally overflows.\nConstant virtue returns,\nthus it is said: returning to simplicity.\n\nSimplicity scatters to form vessels—\nthe Sage uses them as officials and leaders,\nthus the great order knows no cutting.\nBefore differentiation, there is simplicity.\nThe Three Powers have their places—vessels.\nFrom the formless to the manifest,\nthus it is said: scattering simplicity to form vessels.\nThe high and low of Heaven and Earth are established,\nthe noble and base of ruler and subject are clear—\nplanting the ruler as the root,\nthus it is said: officials and leaders.\nOverseeing all under heaven,\nthus it is said: great order.\nAbove, nurturing like a parent,\nbelow, ensuring no harm—\nthus it is said: no cutting.\n\nPity extends to all things,\nand all things are preserved—\nno cutting.\n\n**Chapter XXIX**\nIf one seeks to take all under heaven by force,\nI see that it cannot be done.\nNon-action and non-doing\ncan govern all under heaven.\nIf one acts with doing and force,\nI see that it cannot be done.\n\nAll under heaven is a divine vessel—\nit cannot be seized.\nSeizing it brings ruin,\ngrasping it leads to loss.\nIf one instead shares all under heaven’s goodness,\nwithout privatizing its benefits,\nremoves all under heaven’s harm,\nwithout claiming its rewards,\nthen the four seas bathe in virtue and drink in harmony,\nand all things follow transformation, rejoicing in customs—\nthus one can secure the great treasure,\nand guard the divine vessel.\n\nThe pity of the Dao does not know force,\nyet those who grasp at force as right\nwill meet with ruin and loss.\n\nThus things move or follow,\nbreathe or sigh,\nstrengthen or weaken,\ngather or scatter.\nThe laws of action have their paths—\nforward or backward,\nwarm or cold,\nflourishing or decaying.\nTo gather is to bind,\nto scatter is to ruin.\nIf one acts with force,\nthough it may succeed, it must fail.\nIf one acts with non-action,\nit can undo ruin and restore.\n\nThus the Sage avoids excess,\navoids extravagance,\navoids extravagance’s extremes.\nExcess is the pursuit of desire,\nextravagance is the heart’s indulgence in waste,\nand extreme indulgence is boundless greed.\nThe Sage empties the heart, knows sufficiency—\nthis is avoiding excess.\nSees simplicity, embraces purity—\nthis is avoiding extravagance.\nForges joy from contentment—\nthis is avoiding extremes.\n\n**Chapter XXX**\nThose who assist the sovereign with the Dao\ndo not use force to subdue the world—\ntheir deeds return as they were sent.\nLoyal ministers aid the ruler,\nvirtuous ministers harmonize *yin* and *yang*,\nand with the Dao they prevail over all under heaven—\nnot by force, but by the Way.\nWhen subjects serve their superiors,\nthey too should assist with the Dao.\nIf the ruler already follows the Dao,\nhow could he rely solely on arms?\nThe Dao brings mutual peace,\nwhile arms bring mutual assault.\nGive and take—\nthus it is said: *\"deeds return.\"*\n\nWhere armies tread, thorns grow.\nAfter great battles, famine follows.\nFine grains cannot be planted—\nthus thorns flourish.\nThis too is the fault of arms.\nTherefore, the virtuous act decisively,\nyet do not claim strength.\nTo use arms for righteous slaughter is decisive.\nWhen enemies invade, they must be removed—\nnot by relying on the nation’s might.\nDecisive, yet not arrogant,\ndecisive, yet not boastful,\ndecisive, yet not proud,\ndecisive, yet not without cause.\nArrogance comes from self-importance,\nboasting from claiming merit,\nunending victory from love of triumph,\nand showing superiority over enemies—\nthis is pride.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The king’s armies win by righteousness,\nthose of vengeance win by victory,\nthose of anger perish,\nand the proud are destroyed.\"*\nThe skilled warrior decides with resolve,\nyet is not arrogant, not vengeful,\nnot greedy, not proud.\nActing only when unavoidable,\nresponding from behind—\ntheir purpose is to remove the enemy and save the people,\nnot to revel in force or war.\nThis is decisive without aggression.\nA steady heart knows neither pride nor arrogance,\nactions taken only when unavoidable—\nthis is decisive without aggression.\n\nThings flourish then age—\nthis is against the Dao.\nThe Dao rejects what is premature.\nYouth must grow to maturity,\nflourishing must yield to decay—\nthis is the way of things aging.\nThose who delight in arms as strength\nwill see their strength fail—\nthus it is said: *\"against the Dao.\"*\nThe Dao may be followed always,\nbut what is against the Dao must cease early.\n\n**Chapter XXXI**\nFine arms are an inauspicious tool.\nThings recoil from them,\nso those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\nPolished and refined—\nauspicious means \"good.\"\nArms bring the peril of lost kingdoms and slaughtered people—\nthus they are called inauspicious.\nLife is what people cherish,\ndeath what they abhor.\nThus those who follow the Dao do not cherish fine arms.\n\nThe noble in peace values the left,\nin war, the right.\nThe celestial pattern is *wen* (culture),\nhalting the blade is *wu* (martial).\nIn their uses, they are equally vital—\nritual and music must proceed together,\nwater and fire must not be neglected.\nAction must align with principle,\nmovement must follow the time.\nThus in peace, life is cherished—\nthe left is honored—\nin war, killing is paramount—\nthe right is valued.\n\nArms are an inauspicious tool,\nnot the instrument of the noble.\nThough arms may be used,\ntheir cost is great.\nThey are the domain of claws and teeth,\nnot the ruler’s proper tool.\nWhen unavoidable, their use must be serene and unadorned,\nvictory without glory.\nSerene—this is stillness.\nThe king who deploys armies\nhas cause, not war—\nmovement without losing stillness—\nthus it is said: *\"serene and unadorned.\"*\nTo delight in arms is to delight in slaughter.\nThose who delight in slaughter\ncannot achieve their aims in the world.\nThe ruler is parent to the people—\nto delight in arms is not to nurture them.\nThus auspicious matters honor the left,\ninauspicious matters honor the right.\nThe *yang* Way values life—\nthus it is auspicious.\nThe *yin* Way values killing—\nthus it is inauspicious.\nTherefore, the general of the left wing resides on the left,\nthe general of the right wing on the right.\nThe left general commands the auxiliary forces—\nnot to kill—\nthus he resides on the left.\nThe right general leads the assault—\nthus he resides on the right.\nWhen many are slain,\nmourning follows with tears.\nVictory is marked with funeral rites.\nThe purpose of arms is to save people—\nlamenting the loss of the Dao,\ngrieving the excess of slaughter.\nIn ancient times, armies were led with compassion,\nvalued by virtue,\ndeemed inferior to moral force.\nAfter victory, the general wore mourning robes,\nconducted funeral rites,\nand received condolences.\n\n**Chapter XXXII**\nThe Dao is ever nameless.\n\n「The Dao of simplicity, though small,\nholds the world in awe and does not submit.\nThings with names are all transient—\nyet the nameless is eternal and true.\nReturn to the Way of constancy.\nSimplicity, the root—\nsubmission, the base.\nThe root of constancy is wondrous—\nneither great nor small,\nyet great without being exalted,\nsmall without being debased.\nIf kings and lords can uphold it,\nall things will submit of their own accord.\nWhen the heavens and earth unite,\nsweet dew descends.\nGuard the Dao, and virtue reaches to the four quarters—\nact without striving, and Heaven and Earth harmonize.\nNot only do Heaven and Earth unite,\nbut virtue unites with Heaven and Earth.\nWhen virtue unites with Heaven and Earth,\none knows sweet dew descends,\nand one knows the spring of wine flows—\nthis is the transformation of the Dao.\nNone command, yet all align.\nThe ruler like a guiding branch,\nthe people like wild deer—\nno need for teaching or orders,\nyet all is naturally at peace.\nAt first, the Dao was named—\nonce named, one knows to stop.\nFrom root to origin,\nit gives birth to Heaven and Earth—\nthe Dao was first named.\nHaving obtained its child,\none knows its mother.\nThe child depends on the mother—\nthis is the order of Heaven.\nThus it is said, *knowing to stop*.\nKnowing to stop prevents ruin.\nThe child depends on the mother—\nthings suffer no harm;\nthe man depends on the Dao—\nthe Way meets no peril.\nThe Dao spreads throughout the world,\nlike streams and valleys to the rivers and seas.\nStreams and valleys draw from their upper sources yet never run dry,\nfor they take the rivers and seas as their foundation.\nTaking the rivers and seas as foundation,\nthey return to their source and flow back to the rivers and seas.\nMen are born from the Dao and must return to it—\nif they fail to return, they lose their foundation.\nIt is also said that men have the Dao,\nand all things return to it,\nlike streams and valleys to the rivers and seas.\n\n**Chapter XXXIII**\nTo know others is wisdom,\nto know oneself is enlightenment.\nTo hear and know is called sagely,\nto see and know is called wise.\nYet what is difficult to know externally is man,\nand what is difficult to know internally is oneself.\nNow, to discern others and know their good and evil—\nthis is wisdom;\nto reflect on oneself and know one’s gains and losses—\nthis is enlightenment.\nKnowing good, one approaches the virtuous—\nlike staining oneself with fragrant orchids;\nknowing evil, one avoids the petty—\nlike fleeing the fishmonger’s stall.\nKnowing gain, one fulfills it with loyalty and sincerity;\nknowing loss, one removes it with repentance and regret.\nThis is the union of enlightenment and wisdom.\nHe who conquers others has strength,\nhe who conquers himself is powerful.\nThe man who uses strength—\nthe greater his strength, the more he conquers others.\nThe man who uses virtue—\nthe higher his virtue, the more things submit to him.\nCultivating virtue and refining practice,\nself-strengthening without ceasing,\nnot indulging in what is not—\nthis is conquering oneself.\nThe man who cultivates the Dao forgets his concerns,\nand thus external things cause no harm—\nhence it is said, *he conquers others*.\nWith an empty heart, his spirit bones grow stronger daily—\nhence it is said, *he conquers himself*.\nThe man who knows contentment is rich,\nthe man who acts with resolve has purpose.\nHe who knows his measure,\nfinds joy in a single gourd and calls it wealth.\nHe who covets profit,\naccumulates a hundred million yet remains poor.\nAdorning oneself and striving for self-improvement,\nacting resolutely and trusting in the Dao—\nthe more steadfast, the more purposeful.\nHe who does not lose his place endures long.\nThe teachings of the highest vehicle\nare given to instruct men.\nFollowing the teachings and refining one’s practice,\none does not stray from their principles.\nThus it is said, *he who does not lose his place*.\nThe ruler who governs by the Dao\nwill have his kingdom endure long.\nThe man who cultivates himself by the Dao\nwill have his life and vitality endure long.\nHe who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\nWhen the king has the Dao,\nthe heavens are clear, the earth is tranquil,\nmen are at ease, their spirits harmonious,\nand there is no more danger of decline.\nEven if calamities and decay should befall him,\nor if fate brings adversity and obstruction,\nhe who dwells in danger yet finds peace,\nwho abides in adversity yet remains harmonious,\npreserves himself through endless ages—\nthus it is said, *he who dies yet does not perish is long-lived*.\nThe man who cultivates the Dao\nwith a body nearing its hundredth year\ngains a lifespan beyond all measure—\nthis is also *dying yet not perishing*.\nYet all things have birth and death,\nwhile men have both existence and nonexistence—\nall are governed by Heaven.\nThe Dao neither gives birth nor perishes,\nyet it can show birth and death.\nThough born, it does not exist,\nthough it dies, it does not perish.\nNeither existing nor perishing,\nthus it is called *long-lived*.\n\n**Chapter XXXIV**\nThe Great Dao flows unrestrained,\nleft and right it may be turned.\nA hollow boat drifts without mooring,\nthe Great Dao flows and communicates subtly.\nUnmoored, it is not hindered by east or west;\nsubtly communicating, it is not confined by left or right.\nThus, entering the finest hairs, it leaves the small behind,\nspanning the universe, it forgets the great.\nIts reflections are not singular,\nits transformations elusive and unending.\nAll things respond to it—\nwhat cannot be done?\nAll things rely on it for birth yet do not refuse it.\nThings obtain birth through the Great Dao,\nthe Dao alone transforms without ceasing.\nThe giver of birth does not claim it as merit,\nthe born do not repay it as virtue.\nThe ultimate truth of the Dao\ndoes not exchange words of gratitude.\nSuccess is nameless.\nThe Dao gives birth to things and thus they are born—\nthis is success.\nThe giver and the born alike are forgotten,\nthus it is nameless.\nIt clothes all phenomena yet does not rule them—\nit may be called small.\nIt nourishes all uniformly,\ncovers all without distinction—\nthis is clothing.\nIt grows yet is never reaped,\nthus it does not rule.\nIt may be spoken of as small,\nyet it is not small.\nAll things return to it yet it does not rule—\nit may be called great.\nAll phenomena revolve in cycles,\nnever escaping the formless.\nIt gathers all beginnings and ends,\ndepending on the void and emptiness.\nThus it is said, *all things return to it*.\nIt may be called great,\nyet it is not great.\nTherefore, the sage never claims to be great,\nand thus he achieves true greatness.»\n\nThe sage aligns with the Dao’s nurturing and forgets merit through its ultimate principle,\nnever clinging to the transient or the named.\nHe does not confine himself to the realm of small or great,\nbut must transcend both—thus it is said, *he never claims to be great*.\n\nTo grasp is to become small;\nto abandon the mind is to become great.\nNot great yet great—\nthus he achieves true greatness.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Fifth**\nHold to the Great Image, and all under heaven will come.\nThe Great Image is formless.\nThe formless is the Dao of boundless emptiness—great.\n\n*Hold*—this means to focus, to sustain.\nHe who sustains his body beneath the shadow of profound virtue\nand concentrates his mind at the gate of silent stillness\nfinds that when the Dao is embraced, things return—\nthus it is said, *all under heaven will come*.\n\nWhen they come without harm, there is peace and ease.\nLike clouds spreading oil, all things are moistened;\nlike dew bearing fat, every grass flourishes.\nYet even in nourishing the smallest,\nthere is benefit—\nthis is the Dao’s return without harm.\n\nHow does this principle of no harm manifest?\nStillness of body and spirit is called *peace*;\noblivion to life and death is called *ease*;\nmysterious harmony between all is called *tranquility*.\n\nDelight and indulgence are but passing guests.\nThe five tones of music are delight;\nthe eight rare flavors are indulgence.\nA hundred years in the body—\na passing guest.\n*Stop*—this means to linger, to abide.\nThose who return to the Dao can ease all emotions,\nbut those who fail to awaken\ncling to music to vent their spirits,\nrely on orchids and cassia for comfort,\nand cannot hold to the Great Image—\nhow then can they achieve tranquility?\n\nThe Dao’s expression is bland, without taste.\nThe ornate and flourishing are what the world desires,\nyet the void and stillness are what the human heart cannot settle upon.\nWhat the heart desires is called *beauty*;\nwhat it cannot settle upon is called *bland*.\n\nThe eye cannot see what is unseen,\nthe ear cannot hear what is unheard,\nthe mind cannot grasp what is limitless.\n*Limitless*—this means complete, exhaustive.\n\nWhat the eye perceives is color,\ndazzled by the radiant hues of blue and yellow;\nwhat the ear hears is sound,\nbewildered by the discord of pitch and tone;\nwhat the heart covets is profit,\nclouded by the allure of treasures and jewels.\nThough treasures bring profit,\ntheir use is finite;\nthough sounds may please,\ndeafness knows no distance;\nthough colors may charm,\nblindness lies near.\nThus it is known—\nthose who stop at delight and indulgence\nsuffer these afflictions.\n\nYet the Dao of serene simplicity and non-action,\nthough unseen by the eye,\nreveals itself to those who penetrate—\ntheir vision is clear, nothing remains obscure.\nThough unheard by the ear,\nit is grasped by those who resonate—\ntheir hearing is acute, their wisdom deepens.\nThough the mind cannot calculate it,\nthose who attune employ it without end.\n\nThe Dao’s appeal to the common is like this,\nits paths of gain and harm are such.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 36:**\nWhen one is about to make it slack,\none must first stretch it taut.\nWhen one is about to block the *fù* and close the gates,\nthe foolish man refuses—\nthus, let him open the *fù* and cross the border,\nand he will be exhausted before he ceases.\n\nWhen one is about to weaken it,\none must first strengthen it.\nTo still the heart’s fierce and mighty spirit,\nyet indulge its rigid and resolute will—\nthe weak will breed followers,\nthe strong will meet their end in action,\nand suffering will reach its limit when it must stop.\n\nWhen one is about to abandon it,\none must first raise it.\nWhen it wanes, it grows yet more vigorous;\nwhen things reach their extreme, they turn back upon themselves.\nWhen one is about to take it away,\none must first give it.\n\nTo take away its evil,\nif the evil persists unchecked,\nevil accumulates to destroy the self—\nonly then does one awaken to its folly.\nThis is called *Wēimíng* (微明).\n\nThe Sage’s *quán* Dao (权道) is observed from above,\nyet it does not appear like the application of teaching.\nTo explore its principle is to grasp its profound resources—\nits subtlety is wondrous, its distinctions clear and beneficial,\nhence it is called *Wēimíng* (微明).\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 81:**\nThe Dao’s transformations are expounded at length,\nyet common hearts remain bound—\ntheir attachments differ,\nso the truth is shown to them,\nyet they do not follow.\nThus, *quán* Dao (权道) is employed to transform them,\nso they may know to return to the *Xuán* teaching (返玄教),\nand its profound and distant ways suit them well.\n\n*Quán* Dao (权道) is first revealed in argument,\nthe true solution is then made manifest.\nTo gather and restrain, open the scriptures for transformation;\nto weaken worldly desires, strengthen their *xiān* essence (仙骨).\nTo abandon false intentions, grant them the true Dao;\nto take away evil deeds, give them virtuous actions.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard.\n*Quán* Dao (权道) follows without contradiction,\nthus it is said that softness must ultimately prevail over hardness—\nhence it is called *victory*.\n\nA fish cannot be taken from the depths,\nthe state’s sharpest tools\nshould not be displayed to the people.\nTo take from the depths is to lose it.\nThe fish’s swimming depends on rivers and lakes;\nthe Sage’s greatest treasure\ndraws upon the resources of sharp tools.\n\nA fish cannot lose its water,\nor it perishes.\nSharp tools cannot be shown to the people,\nor danger ensues.\nThus it is said:\nOne may lead the people by the path,\nbut one cannot make them know it.\nThis is the way of holding to *quán* Dao (执权之道)—\nit does not alter the people’s nature.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 38**\nThe virtue/power of the highest Dao does not claim itself as virtue/power—\nhence it is said to have virtue/power.\nClarifying the ancient imperial Way,\ndwelling in the Supreme Void as the heart,\nconcentrating the utmost unity as the body,\nit neither speaks nor interferes with Heaven and Earth’s transformations,\nyet all things are accomplished without effort.\nIt does not seek the fame of ritualized courtesy,\nyet there is no strife of arms.\nThough dwelling at the peak of the highest and the extreme,\nit neither contends nor seeks renown—\neffortless and natural, hence it is called *highest virtue/power*.\nActing yet not clinging,\nachieving success yet not dwelling upon it—\nhence it is called *not virtue/power*.\nNurturing all things,\nthings attain completion—\nhence it is called *having virtue/power*.\nWithin, one understands virtue/power and harmonizes with the Dao,\nits meaning is revered—\nhence it is called *highest virtue/power*.\nThe Dao has no form,\nvirtue/power is empty and mysterious—\nconcealing light and storing action,\nhence it is called *not virtue/power*.\nThough stored in action,\nthe actionless action is indeed action.\nConcealing light,\nthe unblazing light is indeed light.\nHaving action and light,\nit benefits both people and things—\nhence it is said: *thus it is called having virtue/power*.\n\nThe virtue/power of the lower Dao does not lose its virtue/power—\nhence it is said to have no virtue/power.\nThe winds of virtue/power nearly lost,\nthe transformations of benevolence and righteousness almost to arise—\nwhen texts are proclaimed,\nthe vulgar and the refined gradually emerge—\nhence it is called *lower virtue/power*.\nClaiming virtue/power as virtue/power,\nclaiming achievement as achievement,\nrelying on virtue/power to attack achievement—\nhence it is called *not losing virtue/power*.\nClinging to words and claiming virtue/power,\nit does not reach the Dao of non-action—\nhence it is said: *thus it is called having no virtue/power*.\nWithin, one understands the body as identical to emptiness and stillness—\nthis is virtue/power’s highest.\nAffairs become entangled—\nthis is virtue/power’s lowest.\nSeizing and clinging in the heart,\nhence it is called *not losing virtue/power*.\nThe seizer loses it—\nhence it is called *having no virtue/power*.\n\nThe highest virtue/power acts yet has no means to act—\n*use* (为) is *action* (用).\nThe highest action acts without means to act upon the lower,\nthe lower action acts without means to serve the higher.\nThe lower virtue/power acts yet has means to act—\nthe highest action uses means to guide the lower,\nthe lower also uses means to serve the higher—\nhow so?\nGrasses sway with the wind, drifting east and west,\nshadows follow form, bending crooked and straight—\nthus it is known:\nOne who rules within the seas cannot engage in many affairs,\nreturning to the Void and tranquility.\nTeaching disciples cannot stray from propriety,\nrighteousness abides in loyalty and filial piety.\n\nThe highest benevolence acts yet has no means to act,\nthe highest righteousness acts yet has means to act.\nUniversal love and broad benevolence—\nthis is benevolence.\nRewarding the good and punishing the evil—\nthis is righteousness.\nIf one steadfastly holds to virtue/power and the Dao,\nit is fitting for the highest.\nThe distinction between highest virtue/power and lower virtue/power,\nthe refined and the vulgar,\nis clear in the governance of gain and loss—\nnon-action and action.\nThe lower virtue/power’s designation as action\nis inferior to the highest virtue/power.\nThe highest benevolence’s designation as non-action\nis superior to the highest righteousness.\n\nThe highest propriety acts yet meets no response—\nthen one forces the arms and compels it.\nThe *Classics of Propriety* (上礼) number three hundred,\nthe *thousandfold admonitions* (威仪) three thousand—\nwith these to instruct the people,\nhence it is said: *one acts*.\nPropriety becomes burdensome, chaos ensues,\nthe lower cannot practice it—\nhence it is said: *yet it meets no response*.\nThis may be called: *trust insufficient, thus distrust arises*.\nTrust and belief can naturally forget words,\nbut distrust breeds anger and contention—\nthus one brandishes fists and forces the arms,\nmutually dragging and pulling.\nHence: *losing the Dao, then virtue/power; losing virtue/power, then benevolence; losing benevolence, then righteousness; losing righteousness, then propriety*.\n\nThe ancient mysteries were pure and harmonious,\nthe sentiments of things were sincere and real—\npeople were self-sufficient,\nnot needing benevolence and righteousness to warm and nourish them.\nFamilies practiced non-action,\neach cherishing virtue/power and the Dao in their conduct.\nNo *hexagram lines* (爻) nor *symbols* (象) were formed,\nno traces of teaching arose—\ndistinguishing close and distant,\nforgetting noble and base—\nthis was the *highest Sage’s* knowledge below,\nthe transformation of the *Great Dao*.\n\nWhen these winds scattered,\nfalse titles arose—\nthe meaning of nurturing was practiced,\nthe achievement of assistance became visible.\nThe Sage’s influence was subtle,\nthe common folk were at ease—\nthis was the transformation of the *highest virtue/power*.\n\nKindness and affection generated,\nbroad love and achievement arose—\nkindness had limits to its universality,\nlove had distinctions in its application—\nthe vulgar winds grew thick.\nKindness and love were insufficient to transform customs,\nthus rewards and punishments were used to govern the people.\nAgain, the meaning of rewards and punishments was abandoned,\nthe rituals of benevolence and righteousness were neglected—\nteaching was reduced to barter and exchange,\nconduct was carried out with jade and silk—\nthe ruler was deceived above,\nthe minister was deceived below—\nthe pure source had faded,\nthe vulgar and the refined were in turmoil.\nPropriety, then, was the beginning of chaos.\n\nForeknowledge—\nthis is the Dao’s superficiality,\nthe beginning of folly.\nVirtue/power and the Dao are the Dao’s substance.\nBenevolence and righteousness are the Dao’s superficiality.\nThose who first recognize benevolence and righteousness\nsee only superficiality, not substance.\nThe enlightened naturally align with reason,\nthe ignorant still await instruction from teachers.\nKnowing propriety is not the foundation of the highest wisdom—\nit is the beginning of the lowest folly.\nThus, the great man dwells in substance, not superficiality,\nabides in reality, not ornament—\nhence it is said: *discard that, take this*.\n\nDispersing simplicity to make vessels,\nreturning to its origin is the most pure—\nlosing the Dao, then virtue/power—\nits end is vulgar and refined.\nThus, benevolence is not innate nature,\nrighteousness is not spontaneous,\ntrust does not come from the heart,\npropriety is mere external ornament—\nright and wrong, war and contention,\ndeceit and cunning in confusion—\nfathers and sons lose the heart of filial piety,\nrulers and ministers stray from the Way of loyalty and righteousness—\nthus the great Sage, Laozi, lamented the times,\nthe great error of the age,\nthe collapse of the highest Dao—\ndesiring to suppress the latter and exalt the former,\nto still the vulgar and return to the pure—\nhence he raised the *Great Man’s* conduct in governing the state and managing the family,\nin cultivating the self and establishing practice—\ndiscarding superficial rituals,\nreturning to the true Dao.\n\n**Chapter 39**\nThose ancient who attained *Oneness* (一):\nHeaven attained *Oneness* to become clear,\nEarth attained *Oneness* to become responsive,\nValleys attained *Oneness* to become full,\nAll things attained *Oneness* to become alive,\nLords and kings attained *Oneness* to rectify the world.\n\n**Chapter 40**\nOne is the *Primordial Qi*—undivided, hence called *One*.\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast, they draw upon the *Primordial One*.\nThough all things are abundant, they rely upon *Purity and Harmony*.\nThough lords and kings are noble, they depend upon the *True Dao*.\n\nThus, Heaven is clear and vast in its coverage,\nEarth is tranquil and thick in its bearing,\nTransformation is refined and spiritual,\nVacuity is expansive and full,\nPeace and ease preserve all life,\nNon-action establishes rectitude—\nhow is this achieved?\nAll attain *Oneness* through the Dao.\n\nIn its attainment,\nthe Dao knows no rise or fall,\nyet things gain or lose.\nThose who attain it grow ever stronger,\nthose who lose it decline ever more.\nHeaven, without clarity, would fear to crack,\nEarth, without tranquility, would fear to erupt,\nSpirit, without vitality, would fear to fade,\nValleys, without fullness, would fear to dry,\nAll things, without life, would fear to perish,\nLords and kings, without nobility, would fear to fall.\n\nThe *True One* Dao must not be lost.\nLost, it brings fear of ruin—\nto form, fear of disturbance,\nto mystery, fear of extinction,\nto emptiness, fear of exhaustion,\nto life, fear of annihilation,\nto nobility, fear of downfall.\n\nThus, nobility finds its root in humility—\na kingdom’s foundation lies in its people,\nfor even the highest rise from the lowly.\nNine-tiered towers begin with piled earth.\nHence, lords and kings call themselves *\"Lonely, Few, and Without Grain\"*—\n*\"Lonely, Few, and Without Grain\"* are the humble titles of kings,\nlest they forget their roots.\nIs this not taking humility as root?\nNo—it is saying that true nobility stems from humility.\n\nThus, one earns *countless praises* without praise,\nfor kings who are truly noble yet name themselves humble—\nthese are the Dao-bearing rulers.\nSongs and odes praise their virtue, yet they do not claim renown—\nthis is *countless praise*.\nTo heed slander and accept counsel, yet not take it as blame—\nthis is *countless reproach*.\n\nThe enlightened gentleman transcends external honor and disgrace,\nunshaken by gain or loss,\nhis heart forgets praise and blame,\nhis joy and anger do not show on his face.\nHe does not desire to gleam like jade,\nnor to be rough like stone.\nJade gleams but is rare, hence noble,\nstone is rough but common, hence low—\nthe lowly are despised, the noble are fit to govern,\nyet neither brings true ease.\n\nTo hold nobility with humility,\nto dwell in humility without craving equality—\nto attain *One* and abide in *Middle*—\nonly then is there no unease, whether high or low.\n\n**Chapter 41**\nThe superior man, hearing the Dao,\nstrives to practice it with diligence;\n\n**Chapter 40**\nThe Dao moves through *returning*,\nits power lies in *weakness*.\nThe Dao employs softness and weakness,\nits actions all reverse convention—\nto hold firmness in the heart is to lose the Dao.\nAll things arise from *Being*,\n*Being* arises from *Non-Being*.\n*Being*—Heaven and Earth take form, hence called *Being*.\nHeaven covers, Earth bears, and things thereby live—\nthus, they arise from *Being*.\n*Non-Being*—the Dao has no form,\nits essence is pure and void, hence called *Non-Being*.\nHeaven and Earth follow the Dao to take form,\nthus *Being* arises from *Non-Being*—\nhence, *voidness* is the root of Heaven and Earth,\n*Non-Being* is the source of all things.\n\nThe confused lose the Dao,\nnot recognizing the origin.\nThe Sage teaches, clarifying the beginning—\nif one transcends life and death, entering *Non-Being* and *Being*,\nthen the deluded, lost in *Being* and *Non-Being*,\nare bound to life and death.\nForm and spirit unite to manifest—\nthus, they arise from *Being*.\nForm and spirit scatter, leaving no substance—\nthus, *Being* arises from *Non-Being*.\n\nThe faithful in the Dao grow ever more steadfast,\nstrengthening their resolve with unwavering will.\nThrough shifting seasons, their resolve remains unshaken,\nthough gold and stone may melt, their integrity stands firm—\nbeginning and end, ever constant,\nunshaken as the mountains.\n\nThis is the virtue of diligent practice.\n\nThe middling scholar hears the Dao,\nnow grasping, now losing it—\nlike unspun silk, shifting hues with every whim.\nThe middling scholar is unstable,\ntheir heart swaying with desire and aversion.\n\nWhen they encounter true Dao,\nthey preserve life to secure the realm,\nyet cling to Dao while forgetting the common way.\nWhen they see wealth and beauty,\nthey indulge their nature to gratify their passions,\nyet cling to the common way while losing heart and Dao.\n\nThe lesser scholar hears the Dao and laughs.\nTheir mind is clouded by gain and loss,\nknowing the near but not the far,\ntheir senses dulled to truth and falsehood,\ntheir understanding shallow—\nthey delight in petty virtues of the dusty world,\nyet mock the vast, empty Way.\n\nNot to laugh is not the Dao.\nThe Dao is profound and mysterious—\nthe lesser fool’s difficulty to grasp.\nIts subtlety and penetration\nare beyond the dull to recognize.\nNow they laugh, yet cannot make the true mingle with the impure—\nonly to reveal the Dao’s purity and distance.\n\nThus it is said:\nHuman hearts are not one,\ntheir choices vary with their wills.\nThe Sage establishes teachings—\nwithout teaching, yet teaching all—\nfor common hearts turn toward or away,\nsome believing, some not.\n\nClarity like darkness,\nwisdom without bounds—\nthis is illumination.\nShining without glare—\nthis is darkness.\n\nDiligent practice advances,\nyet great attainment seems incomplete—\nthis is retreat.\n\nThe Way of equality is like uniformity—\nlevel and equal, this is the Way of equality.\nHarmonizing light with dust,\nthis is uniformity.\n\nGreat virtue is like a valley—\nit contains all things.\nGreat brightness is like shame—\nmodest yet unstained, this is great brightness.\nMingling like impurity,\nthis is shame.\n\nBroad virtue seems insufficient,\ngreat fullness seems empty.\nEstablished virtue seems petty—\nhidden practice, subtle influence.\nTrue substance seems petty—\n*petty* means transformation.\nNature knows no purity or impurity,\nessence remains ever true—\nthis is true substance.\nTranscending life and death,\nembracing transformation—\nthis is petty.\n\nThe greatest square has no corners—\nthe cosmos encompasses forms,\nyet the Way has no shape.\nThe greatest vessel matures late—\naccumulated habit becomes natural,\nbeauty ripens with time—\nthus, cultivating heart and practice\ncannot be achieved in a single day.\n\nGreat sound is rare—\nthe bell chimes in response to rhythm,\nthe Mysterious Teaching acts in accordance with circumstances.\n\nThe greatest form has no shape—\nthe Dao is hidden, nameless.\nThe void encompasses all forms—\nthus, it is called the greatest form.\nWithout shape, it is formless.\nUnseen, the Dao is hidden.\nBeyond all names, it is nameless.\n\nOnly the Dao\ncan generously bestow life.\nAdvancing yet appearing to retreat—\nthis is no advancement.\nRetreating yet advancing—\nthis is retreat.\nClarity like darkness—\nthis is not clarity.\nDarkness like clarity—\nthis is not darkness.\n\nThe supreme truth of the Dao\nis neither advance nor retreat,\nneither clarity nor darkness—\nwithout color, without sound,\nwithout form, without name.\n\nThough nameless, what name cannot stand?\nThough formless, what form cannot be seen?\nThus, it breathes *qi* and transforms,\nbestowing life upon all things,\nacting yet not relying on itself,\nentrusting to the natural order.\n\n---\n**Chapter 42**\nThe Dao gives rise to *Oneness*—\nthe void stirs with *qi*, hence the Dao gives rise to *Oneness*.\nBefore *qi* divided, it was called *Oneness*.\n*Oneness* gives rise to *Twoness*—\nclear and turbid separate, yin and yang take form.\n*Twoness* gives rise to *Threeness*—\nthe interplay of two *qi* forms the three essences.\n*Threeness* gives rise to all things.\nThe round heaven covers above,\nthe square earth bears below,\nand the sovereign governs between—\nwhat thing cannot arise?\n\nAll things embrace yin while holding yang,\nharmonizing *qi* to achieve balance.\nYang *qi*, hot and solitary, cannot give life,\nyin *qi*, cold and lone, cannot form shape—\nthus, they rely on the Great Dao to connect them,\nborrowing harmonizing *qi* to balance them,\nand so they live.\n\nWhat humans despise are the solitary, the orphaned, the childless—\nyet kings and nobles name themselves thus.\nThey embrace harmonizing *qi*,\nneither liking nor disliking.\nLosing the Way of *Oneness*,\nthey love and they hate.\nThey only cherish the names of wealth and nobility,\nyet shun the titles of solitude and want.\n\nOnly the Dao-abiding sovereign\nhumbles themselves to govern,\npracticing modesty and retreat as their name.\n\nThus, some things are diminished yet gain,\nothers gain yet are diminished.\nTo be called solitary and orphaned with wealth and nobility—\nthis is diminution.\nTo renew oneself daily in humility—\nthis is gain.\nWithout virtue in high station,\nself-deception is thought gain.\nLow talent in high rank\nmust lead to ruin—\nthis is diminution.\n\nWhat humans teach,\nI also teach as my principle.\nHuman teachings in the world\nrest on reason and righteousness,\nyet rigidity and strength are the path of death,\nwhile reason and righteousness are the adornments of the Dao.\nI teach as my principle\nto move away from rigidity and embrace softness,\nto distance from reason and righteousness while securing virtue and the Way.\n\nIt is said the Sage teaches all beings appropriately,\nadapting to what is taught.\n*Principle* means *appropriateness*.\nThe rigid and overbearing\ndo not die as they should—\nI will make them my teachers.\n\nThose who disobey their parents and sovereigns,\nwho defy the Sage’s teachings,\nwho cling to glory and victory,\nwho exalt themselves over others—\nthese are the rigid and overbearing.\nThey violate laws, cut short their years,\ndying prematurely in their prime—\nthis is not true death.\n\nAll things conform to the Dao;\nthe Sage teaches without exception.\nWhen human hearts stray from reason,\nthe Transforming Sovereign speaks.\nThrough the adornments of reason and righteousness,\nthe reality of virtue and the Way is revealed.\nThrough the nature of rigidity and overbearing,\nthe laws of softness and weakness are enacted.\nThe parent is the root—\nrigidity is made the root of teaching.\n\n---\n**Chapter 43**\nThe softest in the world\novercomes the hardest in the world.\nThe softest with form is water—\nthe softest without form is the Dao.\nWater, though soft, can dissolve metal and pierce stone,\nbreaking the strongest.\nThe Dao, though soft, can honor the self-forgetful,\nbreaking rigid fixation.\n\nIf one can reflect upon water,\nembody the Dao,\npenetrate the distinctions of self and other,\ntest it against hills and mountains—\nits subtlety and penetration\nknow no obstruction—\nthis is called overcoming the hardest.\n\n**Chapter 44**\nWhat cannot enter the void?\nWater knows no obstruction.\nThe Dao has no form.\nWith or without gaps,\nIt enters everywhere.\nThus, one knows the benefit of *wuwei*.\nThe Dao, formless, yet all things are formed.\nThe Sage acts without doing—\nand all beings are transformed.\nThis is the benefit of *wuwei*.\nTeaching without words,\nthe benefit of *wuwei*—\nyet before, we spoke of *wuwei*’s benefit,\nbut now we ask: what is *wuwei*?\nPractice teaching without words—\nand teaching forgets words.\nFollow natural course—\nand affairs dissolve into nothing.\nI rest above, the ministers delight below—\nthis is the true benefit.\n\nFew attain it in the world.\nThose who act with doing are many;\nthose who attain *wuwei* are few.\n\nWhich is dearer—name or body?\nWhich is more—body or wealth?\nWhich is more harmful—gain or loss?\nNames are external praise.\nWealth is the world’s silk and cloth.\nThe body is the root of loyalty and filial piety,\nthe foundation of virtue.\nOne must abandon external fame and profit,\npreserve the body and spirit,\nreturn to *wuwei*,\ncultivate the Supreme Way—\nyet those who weaken and lose do not return,\nthose who chase desires lose their true nature,\nand thus name kills the body,\nwealth harms the self.\nMany are lost in delusion.\nThe Sage pities them,\nand so asks in detail:\nIs gain beneficial or harmful?\nIs losing name or profit harmful?\nThe vulgar take gaining name and profit as good—\nyet gaining them brings death.\nLosing them is evil—\nyet losing them brings life.\nWho determines gain, loss, harm, or benefit?\nLoss is the same as losing.\nThus, excessive love brings great waste—\nto seek name and kill the body is great waste.\nHoarding much brings great loss—\nto seek wealth and harm the self is great loss.\nKnowing contentment brings no shame—\nnot pursuing external fame keeps one far from disgrace.\nKnowing restraint brings no peril—\nnot scheming against reason for wealth avoids danger.\nThus, one endures forever.\nTo distance oneself from fame and profit,\nto avoid peril and harm—\nto govern the realm is to ensure its longevity,\nto cultivate the self is to preserve it long.\n\n**Chapter 45**\nThe greatest completion seems incomplete—\nits use never wears out.\nThe Dao is whole, virtue is complete—\nthis is called greatest completion.\nThough complete, it seems lacking—\nyet the great abyss, when drawn from, is never exhausted;\nthe bright mirror, when reflected in, knows no fatigue—\nits use never wears out.\n\nThe greatest fullness seems empty—\nits use is inexhaustible.\nFour directions extend equally, yet all are illuminated;\nsix pathways reveal no hidden depths—\nthis is greatest fullness.\nNot using illumination as illumination,\nnot using fullness as fullness—\nthis is emptiness.\nIts use is not constrained by the mind—\nthus, it knows no limit.\n\nThe greatest straightness seems crooked—\nstraightness aligns with the Dao.\nTo follow desire as if bending—\nthis is greatest straightness.\n\nThe greatest skill seems clumsy—\nthe artisan completes all things—\nyet it seems unable—\nthis is greatest clumsiness.\n\nThe greatest eloquence seems inarticulate—\nto discuss the heavens and clarify principles—\nyet speech dissolves into silence—\nthis is greatest inarticulateness.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold;\nstillness overcomes heat.\nYin and Yang qi alternate in function.\nYang qi is agitated and hot;\nyin qi is still and cold.\nWhen yang qi prevails, stillness overcomes agitation—\nthus, the sequence shifts, and balance determines victory and defeat.\n\nIf greatest completion seems incomplete,\nif greatest fullness seems empty—\nthen there is no excess.\nIf its use never wears out, never exhausts—\nthen there is no decline.\nNo excess, no decline,\nno cold, no heat—\nit preserves completion without ruin,\nforgets victory without defeat.\nClarity and stillness are the norm for the world.\nTo be swayed by yin and yang’s cold and heat—\nthis is not clarity.\nTo be moved by life and death’s flux—\nthis is not stillness.\nThe Sage knows life and death do not alter them,\ncold and heat do not burden them—\nthis is clarity and stillness.\nWhere wheels turn, life and death are both bound.\nWithout wheels turning, transcending life and death—\nthis is the norm for the world.\n\n**Chapter 46**\nWhen the Way prevails in the world,\nwarhorses are turned to manure.\nThe sovereign follows the Way—\nhe dismisses the horses of urgent command.\nMinisters practice *wuwei*—\nthey manure the fields of sericulture.\nThose who cultivate the True abandon restless emotions—\nthey manure the body and spirit with virtue and the Dao.\nScholars sever drifting laziness—\nthey manure the empty heart with learning and letters.\n\nWhen the Way does not prevail in the world,\nwarhorses rise in the suburbs.\n*Rise* means *arise*.\nWithout the Way, yet adorned with culture,\nspecializing in arms and loving war—\nfour borders bristle with fortifications,\nfive armies rise—\nwarhorses arise in the suburbs.\n\nWithin, the mind-king is unclear—\nthe six senses gallop like horses,\nthrough ten thousand scenes—\ngain and loss clash,\nright and wrong contend.\nNo guilt is greater than desire,\nno calamity greater than discontent,\nno blame worse than grasping what one desires.\nThose who follow the Way abandon emotion and desire—\ncalamity is removed.\nThe unenlightened indulge their nature, follow their hearts—\ndisaster and blame arrive.\n\nGood accumulates as blessing—\nboth hidden and manifest enjoy it.\nEvil accumulates as calamity—\nboth living and dead bear it.\nPunishment stops at oneself—\nthis is guilt.\nExtending to descendants—\nthis is calamity.\nMisleading ancestors—\nthis is blame.\n\nThe contentment of contentment—\nalways content.\nTo remove desire is to seek nothing externally—\nto purify nature is to lack nothing internally—\nthus, knowing contentment,\nevery action aligns with the Way,\nevery matter is perfectly fulfilled.\nWithout a time of lack—\nalways content.\n\n**Chapter 47**\nWithout leaving the door,\none knows the world.\nObserving through the Dao—\nprinciples are without limit.\nIlluminating with wisdom—\naffairs are without unknowns—\nthis is called knowing without traveling.\n\nWithout peering through the window,\none sees the Way of Heaven.\nTwo luminaries adorn the sky,\nfive stars shine in the Han—\nwhy peer through the window\nto begin seeing inner clarity?\nPeering through the window—\nthis is probing and forcing meaning.\nThe Way of Heaven—\nthis is the natural order.\nWithout artificial aids, one catches fish and rabbits;\nwithout labored teaching, one awakens to ultimate truth—\nthis is not peering through the window to see the Way of Heaven.\n\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.\nCircumnavigating the cosmos,\nyet unaware of mountains and rivers;\ntraversing all scriptures,\nyet unaware of ultimate truth—\nthis is called ignorance.\n\n「Thus, the Sage does not act yet acts—\nthis is called solitary awakening.\nNot seeing yet naming—\nthis is called profound insight.\nNot doing yet achieving—\nthis is called spontaneous alignment.\n\n**Chapter 48:**\nThe pursuit of learning brings daily increase—\nadding to it with scrolls and volumes,\nlengthening it with sights and sounds,\nprofiting it with fame,\nand entangling it with cravings and desires.\nThe pursuit of the Dao brings daily diminishment—\nwalking the unsaid teaching,\nforgetting both form and principle.\nEmbodying the void and subtle Dao,\ndiscarding both self and other.\nIn doing nothing, one loses a hundred doings;\nin having no affairs, one abandons ten thousand affairs.\nWhy should one only discard arrogance and excess?\nDiminish again and again,\nuntil one reaches the state of doing nothing.\nAbandoning possession to return to emptiness—\nthis is the diminisher.\nPossession gone, forgetfulness remains—\nthis is again the diminisher.\nPossession gone, emptiness remains.\nThe principles merge in true stillness,\nreaching the ultimate state of doing nothing.\nDoing nothing yet doing all things—\nthis is the Dao of non-doing.\nThose who hear of non-doing\nstand stiffly, palms clasped,\ntaking cold ashes for the Great Dao,\nand clods of earth for the ultimate mind.\nFearful they may be sealed in rigid non-doing,\nunable to transcend and dissolve,\nhence it is said: *Doing nothing yet doing all things*.\nNot doing is not true non-doing;\ndoing yet returning to non-doing—\nthis is not doing.\nThis is the state where both learning and Dao are forgotten,\nwhere only movement and stillness,\nstillness and movement, are both at rest.\n\nTo govern the world, one must act without affairs;\nwhen affairs arise,\nit is insufficient to govern the world.\n*To govern* means to encompass.\nIf one forgets, there is nothing one does not gather;\nif one acts, there are things one can and cannot do.\nIf one governs with non-doing,\nwhat is absent becomes possible, and what is impossible becomes possible.\nIf one governs with affairs,\nwhat is absent becomes impossible, and what is impossible remains impossible.\n\n**Chapter 49:**\nThe Sage has no mind,\nusing the hearts of the people as his own.\nThe ruler above has no mind for doing,\nletting the people transform themselves naturally.\nThe Sage has no emotional discrimination,\nyet responds to all things in harmony.\nThe good, I make good;\nthe not-good, I also make good—\nthis is called attaining goodness.\nIf one has a discriminating mind,\nthere is good and there is not-good,\nand one cannot attain true goodness.\nNow, having no discriminating mind,\nnot only is the good made good,\nbut the not-good is also made good—\ngood and not-good are both made good,\nhence it is called attaining goodness.\n\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nthe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nthis is called attaining trust.\n*Trust* means to follow.\nSince things have their own nature—\nsome trustworthy, some untrustworthy—\nto act means there is following and not-following.\nThere is following and not-following,\nand one cannot attain perfect trust.\nNow, the Sage has neither trustworthy nor untrustworthy,\nall are trustworthy;\nneither following nor not-following,\nall are following—\nhence it is called Great Following.\n\nThe Sage is in the world,\nrestlessly blending the hearts of the people.\n*Restless* means not fixed.\nOrdinary minds discriminate—\nseeing good and not-good,\ntrusting and not-trusting.\nThe Sage is restless and unfixed,\nwandering freely with the circumstances,\nblending their discriminating hearts,\nequalizing their notions of right and wrong.\nThe people fix their ears and eyes,\nthe Sage treats them all as infants.\nThe people cannot govern their emotions with their nature,\nso they indulge their hearts in desires,\nfix their ears and eyes on sounds and colors,\ndevote their noses and mouths to fragrances and tastes,\nthus becoming befuddled and dim-witted,\ndeaf and blind by their own doing.\nThe Sage follows the disease and practices medicine,\nadapts to the circumstances and expounds teachings,\nfollows the heart to save all things,\nspeaks of self-transformation to transform others—\nthus it is said: *I am still as a newborn babe,*\n*not knowing sounds and colors delight my ears and eyes.*\n\n**Chapter 50:**\nLife and death overlap.\nFrom the hidden to the revealed is called life,\nfrom having to returning to emptiness is called death.\nOf those who seek life, there are thirteen;\nof those who seek death, there are thirteen.\nThe nine orifices and four gates make thirteen.\nIf one can cut off desire, they belong to the life category;\nif they indulge recklessly, they belong to the death category.\nHuman life is the movement toward death’s ground—\nthirteen times over.\nThe reason one flows into death’s ground\nis due to the thirteen kinds of transgression.\nWhy so?\nBecause of the thickness of life’s life.»\n\n**Chapter 51:**\nThe Dao gives birth to it,\nvirtue nurtures it,\nthings shape it—\nwho brings it to completion?\nThe Way flows without obstruction—\nwhere can it not go?\nMysterious virtue moves without hindrance—\nwhat task cannot it accomplish?\n\nNow, if we speak of its functions and applications:\nTo promote life is to return to the Way,\nto nurture is to uphold virtue.\nLife and nurturing belong to things,\neach with its own form.\nWhen it flourishes but bears no fruit, it is called *nao* (孰);\nwhen life and nurturing are fully realized, it is called *cheng* (成).\nThus, all things revere the Way and honor virtue.\nParents give birth, the heavens and earth shelter—\ntruly worthy of reverence.\nYet virtue and the Way surpass the恩 of parents,\ntheir功 overshadows that of heaven and earth—\nthus, they are worthy of human honor.\nThe Way is exalted, virtue is noble—\nyet no title is bestowed upon them,\nfor their honor is natural and constant.\nVirtue and the Way, when forgotten in emptiness,\nare naturally exalted and noble—\nnot because of titles, but because of inherent respect.\n\nThus, the Way gives birth, nurtures, sustains, completes, and fulfills—\nit nourishes and shelters.\nThis broadly illuminates the meaning of virtue and the Way in nurturing life.\n\nTo advance is to *zhang* (长),\nto comfort is to *yu* (育),\nto establish is to *cheng* (成),\nto perfect is to *nao* (孰),\nto provide is to *yang* (养),\nto cover is to *fu* (覆).\nTo give birth without possession,\nto act without control,\nto grow without domination—\nthis is called Mysterious Virtue.\n\nThose who claim its功 are not true功,\nthose who rely on its德 are not great德.\nNow, having given birth and nurtured,\nnot relying, not dominating—\nthis is the profoundest virtue.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 52:**\nThe world has a beginning,\nand it is called the Mother of the world.\nThe Dao is the root of things—\nthus it is called the beginning.\nVirtue is able to nurture—\nthus it is called the Mother.\nHaving obtained its Mother,\none knows its child.\nThe Dao and virtue give birth and nurture—\nthis is the meaning of Mother.\nThings arise from the Dao—\nthe child is thus known.\nHaving known its child,\none must again guard its Mother—\nthen one will not perish in life.\n\nA child is born of parents,\nand must be filial to its parents;\nthings arise from the Dao,\nand must be guarded by the Dao.\nIf a child is filial to its Mother,\nthe Mother is kind to the child—\nthis harmonizes heaven and earth,\nmoves the divine,\nand nothing is harmed.\nIf one guards the Dao,\nthe Dao loves them—\naccumulating功 and acting in virtue,\nmanifesting in both subtle and apparent ways,\nnothing is harmed—\nthus, it is said one will not perish.\n\nThis clarifies the guarding of Mother and child,\nthe gathering of root and branch.\nThose who practice this bring peace to their families and states.\n\nClose the *yue* (兑) and shut the gates—\nthen one will never labor in life.\nCover the eyes and close the mouth—\nexternal calamities will not arise.\nWithout fatigue or toil,\nall strenuousness is cut off.\nReturn to the nameless beginning,\nand abide in the named Mother—\nthis is the Way of cultivating oneself.\n\nOpen the *yue* (兑) and advance in affairs—\nyet one will never be saved in life.\nLosing the Dao and stagnating in convention,\nabandoning the root and following the branches,\nopening the six passions’ *yue* (兑),\nunlocking the five desires’ gates—\nthough one completes burdensome deeds,\none will ultimately lose the Way of *wuwei*.\nThis body will perish,\nand salvation will be difficult.\n\nTo see what is small is called *ming* (明),\nto use softness is called *qiang* (强).\nWhen calamity first arises, it is small—\nto foresee and prevent it is *ming*.\nTo follow the Dao without resistance is softness,\nto remain unharmed from beginning to end is *qiang*.\n\nUse its light,\nand return to its *ming* (明).\nAvoiding bodily harm,\nwisdom illuminates the mechanisms—\nusing this to prevent calamity is its light.\nSeeing what has not yet sprouted,\nbrightly without loss,\ninner vision returns to its *ming*—\nthus, one does not suffer bodily harm.\n\nThis is called **clinging to constancy**.\n\nTo indulge passions and exhaust desires,\nto abandon the root and follow the branches—\ncalamity and difficulty will come,\nand one will return to the **Wu Chang** (無常).\n\nBlock the *yue* (兑) and close the gates,\nguard the Mother and return to the beginning,\npurify the body and enter the Dao—\nthis is clinging to **Zhen Chang** (真常).\n\n---\n**Chapter 53**\nIf I but knew the Way,\nto walk the Great Dao,\nI would tremble with reverence.\n\nThe Sage laments the age’s kings,\nwho do not follow the level path,\nbut tread perilous roads instead—\nwearing ornate robes yet girding sharp blades,\ndisdaining food while hoarding wealth.\nFields lie fallow, granaries stand empty—\nthese are the ways of **thieves and the boastful**,\nnot the pure and true conduct.\n\nIf I but knew governance,\nI would walk the Great Dao of *wuwei*,\nnever straying into the petty paths of action.\nAny deed undertaken,\nI would fear most to fail in doing.\n\nThe Great Dao is most level,\nyet men love the byways.\nThe straight path is smooth and easy,\nthe crooked path steep and hard.\nRulers often tread the difficult,\nwhile those cultivating the self rarely follow the easy.\n\n**Reject the un-Dao.**\n\nMorning’s halls are cleared,\nfields lie overgrown.\nElaborate walls and towering halls—\nold structures torn down, new ones raised.\nCommoners hinder the farmers,\ngood land left to rot.\nPursuing names and profits,\nthey discard the little for the much.\nDaoic cultivation neglected,\nthe **Dan Tian** left barren.\n\nGranaries stand empty.\nWhen harvests are bountiful, stores are full,\nbut when farming is neglected, granaries empty.\nWhen governance is shallow, virtue is hollow,\nbut when virtue is full, the Dao is real.\n\nWearing ornate robes,\ngirding sharp blades—\nabandoning simplicity for adornment,\nvaluing force over culture.\nThose who cultivate the True\ndo not dwell within morality externally,\nbut only adorn themselves with ritual and decorum,\ntheir hearts poisoned by superficiality,\ngirded with blades.\n\nDisdaining food,\nyet hoarding wealth—\nHe who eats without taste,\ndrinks to harmony and bathes in virtue.\nHe who acts without action,\nhonors the worthy and loves the virtuous.\nDespising coarse fare,\nfinding joy in simple meals,\ndispersing wealth,\ntreasuring non-greed as his jewel—\nthis is inner and outer perfection.\n\nYet they glut on delicacies,\npile up pearls and jade—\nthese are the ways of **thieves and the boastful**,\nnot the foundation of family or state.\n\nThis is called **thieving and boasting**.\nThieving and boasting are not the Dao.\nTaking what is not enough to accumulate excess—\nthis is theft.\nLoving adornment, indulging greed—\nthis is boasting.\nOnly theft and boasting\nare not the Dao’s conduct.\n\n---\n**Chapter 54**\nWell-planted, it cannot be uprooted;\nwell-embraced, it cannot slip away.\nAncestral sacrifices will never cease.\n\nIf one establishes conduct in the realm of the **Ultimate Dao**,\nits roots will be deep and unshaken.\nIf one nurtures virtue in the land of **Mystic Power**,\nits stem will be firm and unbroken.\nFor a state, this means eternal ancestral halls;\nfor a family, unending ancestral rites.\n\nThe lineage of teachers and disciples\nis woven in **True Qi**,\npassed down like echoes in the **Mystic Wind**.\n\nCultivate for the self—virtue becomes true;\ncultivate for the family—virtue overflows;\ncultivate for the village—virtue endures;\ncultivate for the state—virtue flourishes;\ncultivate for the world—virtue is universal.\n\nThe Dao must be cultivated,\nvirtue must be established.\nTo establish virtue and cultivate the Dao\nis to shape the family and govern the state—\nwherever one goes, there is no instability.\n\nUnchanging through life and death is called **True**,\nblessings extending to descendants is called **Overflow**,\nnear and far in peace is called **Enduring**,\nall things acting naturally is called **Flourishing**,\nbenevolence without omission is called **Universal**.\n\nThus, observe the self to know the self,\nobserve the family to know the family,\nobserve the state to know the state,\nobserve the world to know the world.\n\nThe source of the **Ultimate Dao** is truly\nneither good nor evil.\nThe beginning of establishing virtue\nrequires knowing right and wrong.\nHe who knows wrong will soon abandon evil,\nhe who knows right will fear not acting in virtue.\n\nDiscerning falsehood and truth,\nilluminating presence and absence—\nthe cultivated self returns to **True**,\nthe uncultivated self falls into **False**.\n\nThe cultivated family has **Overflow**,\nthe uncultivated family lacks.\nThe cultivated village endures,\nthe uncultivated is brief.\nThe cultivated state flourishes,\nthe uncultivated is impoverished.\nThe cultivated world is universal,\nthe uncultivated is deficient.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nHow does one know that the cultivated thrive\nwhile the uncultivated perish?\nObserve one self, and a hundred can be known;\nobserve one state, and ten thousand are revealed—\nhow much more so than the Three Dynasties!\n\n---\n**Chapter 55**\nThe depth of **embracing virtue**\nis like that of an infant.\n\nNurturing the Dao and embracing virtue,\naccumulating conduct deeply,\nqi focused and firm,\ndesires severed, no greed—\nthe pure child remains undispersed,\nlike an infant.\n\nPoisonous creatures do not sting,\nferocious beasts do not seize,\ngrasping birds do not strike.\n\n*\"Sting\"* is with poison,\n*\"seize\"* is with claws,\n*\"strike\"* is with talons.\n\nAn infant is unharmed\nbecause first, there is no poisonous intent within,\nand second, a loving mother protects them—\nthus, they are not injured.\n\nOne who embraces virtue,\nhaving no wicked heart,\nand with Heaven’s grace descending as aid,\nthus poisonous creatures cannot spread their venom,\nnor ferocious beasts unleash their fury.\n\nThough bones are weak and sinews soft,\ntheir grip is firm.\n\nAn infant’s sinews and bones are weak,\nyet their grasp on the thumb is unyielding—\nnot by strength alone,\nbut because the mind is focused;\nthough others try to pry it open,\nthey cannot.\n\nOne who embraces virtue\nbends the body to follow things,\nsoftens the heart to conform to the Dao—\nwhat is desired cannot pry them open,\ntheir True Nature remains naturally firm.\n\nUnknowing the union of male and female,\nyet the **Thunder of the Ancestor** resounds—\nthe essence is most refined.\n\nThe union of male and female is the **confluence of Yin and Yang**.\n*\"Thunder\"* refers to the infant’s **Yin**,\n*\"resounding\"* is movement.\nAn infant, unaware of male-female rites,\nyet moving—\ntheir essence is undispersed to its utmost.\n\nWhen essence scatters, the body withers;\nwhen the body withers, life ends.\n\nOne who embraces virtue\nrejects emotional desires and cherishes their essence,\navoids exertion and treasures their qi.\n\nWithout intent in movement,\nmovement does not disturb stillness;\nemptying the self in stillness,\nstillness does not disturb movement.\n\nStillness does not disturb movement,\nthough moving, it is not moving;\nmovement does not disturb stillness,\nthough still, it is not still.\n\nBeyond motion and stillness—\nthe essence is most refined.\n\nTo cry all day yet not exhaust the *Ge* resonance—\nthis is the ultimate harmony.\n\nWhen weeping ceases without sound, it is called *ge*.\nAn infant who cries ceaselessly at dawn and dusk,\nyet whose voice does not *ge*—\ntheir harmonious qi remains undispersed.\n\nOne who embraces virtue speaks of the Mysterious without fatigue,\nflows the Law’s sound without interruption—\nthis is the result of embracing the Supreme Harmony.\n\nTo know harmony is to know the Constant,\nto know the Constant is to know Clarity.\n\nTo lose essence and deplete qi is to return to the Unconstant;\nto know harmony is to preserve the True Constant.\n\nOne who embraces virtue, having grasped the principle of harmony,\nunderstands the inherent nature of the human body—\nnothing in existence is beyond reach—\nthus they are called *Clarity*.\n\nTo nurture life is called *auspicious*,\nto let the heart direct qi is called *strength*.\n*Auspicious* means *good*,\n*strength* means *flourishing*.\n\nYet those of the vulgar world, bound by artificial pursuits,\ncannot match the infant’s firm grasp of the natural,\nnor emulate the one who embraces virtue in knowing harmony.\nThey chase desires and lose their essence,\nexert force and harm their qi.\nThey nourish life with flavors,\nsupplement qi with medicines—\ntheir hearts command qi to flourish without decline,\ntheir bodies to remain unblemished—\nhow could this be attained?\n\nThus it is said:\nAll know goodness as goodness,\nyet evil has already begun.\n\nWhen things reach their peak, they age—\nthis is called *not the Dao*,\nand *not the Dao* perishes early.\n\nWhen things reach their limit, they reverse;\nwhen the body is at its height, it decays.\n\nAt this stage, the burdens of worldly dust—\nhow could they align with the Constant Way of emptiness and stillness?\n\nThe Venerable Lord laments that sentient beings do not comprehend the Constant,\ncannot receive qi,\nand through artificial nourishment,\ngain only loss.\nHaving strayed from ultimate truth,\nhe warns them to cease such folly.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six.**\n\nThe wise do not speak,\nthose who grasp meaning forget words,\nthose who awaken abandon teachings.\nThose who speak do not understand.\n\nMuch speech brings loss of the Dao,\nclinging to teachings brings loss of truth.\n\nBlock the mouth,\nclose the gate.\nCut off the path of desire,\nsever the source of calamity.\nDull the sharp,\nresolve the wrathful.\nBreak the edge of greed,\nrelease the quarrels of right and wrong.\n\nBlend one’s brilliance,\nharmonize with the dust—\nthis is called *Mysterious Unity*.\nTo contend over gain and loss is sometimes right, sometimes wrong;\nto compete over right and wrong is either this or that.\n\nNow, blending brilliance brings no knowledge, no distinction,\nharmonizing with dust shares in foolishness without separation,\nunifying all things in equal measure—\nwhat law could differ from others?\n\nThus, one cannot be too close, cannot be too distant;\ncannot be too beneficial, cannot be too harmful;\ncannot be too noble, cannot be too base.\nTherefore, one is noble for all under Heaven.\n\nWhen Heaven has near and far, distinctions of closeness and distance arise;\nwhen gain and loss are held, harm and benefit emerge;\nwhen high and low are fixed, nobility and baseness are established.\n\nNow, resolving wrath, dulling sharpness,\nblending brilliance, harmonizing with dust,\nbalancing love and hatred equally—\ncloseness and distance cannot penetrate,\npraise and blame are unified,\nharm and benefit cannot interfere,\nhonor and disgrace are forgotten,\nnobility and baseness have no means to take hold.\nThose who can act thus\nmay be noble for all under Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven.**\nTo govern with *Dao* and order the state,\nto nourish the people—\nits subtlety lies in balance.\nTo spread virtue and transform customs—\nits essence returns to uprightness.\nThis is what is called:\nThe feudal lords and ministers guiding virtue, aligning rites—\nthe cultivation of culture and teaching.\n\nTo employ the *unconventional* in warfare,\nthe *unconventional* is deceit and transformation.\nFacing danger, controlling change—\nwarfare knows no surfeit of deceit.\nThree stratagems, six unconventional tactics,\nnine governance principles, a hundred victories—\nthe supreme general’s stillness extinguishes rebellion,\nhis martial prowess pacifies the land.\nTo take all under Heaven with *non-action*.\n\nThe enlightened ruler’s transformation of all under Heaven—\nwhen discussing *Dao* and spreading virtue, he is the worthy minister;\nwhen upholding principles and punishing rebellion, he is the renowned general.\nSeated in court with the myriad states in attendance,\nhis ears sealed, his spirit concentrated in the nine palaces.\n\nHow do I know all under Heaven is thus?\nBy this.\nHow do I know that *non-action* can take all under Heaven?\nAs the following text states:\n*\"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI take no action, yet the people grow rich.\"*\n\nAll under Heaven abounds in taboos,\nyet the people grow ever poorer.\nTaboos multiply, governance becomes intricate and secretive.\nThe intricate exhausts the people, the secretive fills them with fear.\nFollowing laws hinders livelihood—\nhow could they not grow poor?\n\nWhen people abound in clever tools,\nthe state grows ever more confused.\nCunning strategies should not be widely given,\nweapons should not be in every home.\nIf weapons fill the home, thoughts turn to banditry;\nif cunning is widely held, fear of chaos arises.\n\nWhen people abound in cleverness,\nstrange things proliferate.\nExcessive cleverness breeds strange creations.\nThe ruler indulges in novelties, the people’s desires rise.\nWhen rare and beautiful things become lawful,\nthieves multiply.\nWhen gold and jade are prized,\nbandits arise.\nIt is also said:\nLaws meant to suppress theft instead breed more theft;\nrites meant to order chaos instead foster more chaos.\n\nThus the Sage says:\n*\"I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI take no action, yet the people grow rich;\nI love stillness, yet the people become upright;\nI abandon desire, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nThe four ills of *having-doing* above—\nthus the Sage speaks of the four remedies of *non-doing*,\ndesiring to eliminate chaos, attain transformation,\nremove movement to achieve stillness,\nbring peace to the home and joy to the customs,\n*non-action* and *non-doing*.\nTo entrust to the natural course is called *transformation*,\nall know it as *wealth*,\nwithout bias is called *upright*,\nabandoning ornament to dwell in substance is called *simplicity*.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight.**\nWhen governance is serene and unhurried,\nthe people are sincere and pure.\nWhen governance is broad,\nthe people are joyful.\nWhen the ruler is tranquil and still,\nthe people are simple and unified.\n\nWhen governance is scrutinizing and rigid,\nthe people grow deficient and lacking.\nWhen governance is hasty and burdensome,\nthe people grow weary and impoverished.\n\nCalamity is the foundation of fortune;\nfortune is the seed of calamity.\n*Foundation* means *use*;\n*seed* means *hidden*.\n\nIt is said:\nWhen people suffer, they long for joy,\nand turn from evil to good.\nThrough calamity, fortune is attained—\nif one indulges in joy, ruin follows.\nWhen in nobility, if one grows arrogant,\ncalamity lies hidden within fortune.\n\nWho knows its limits?\nThe causes of good and evil yield the fruits of fortune and calamity,\nthe cycles of suffering and joy—\nwho knows their coming and going to their end?\n\nThere is no fixed *upright*.\nThe *upright* becomes *unconventional*,\nthe *good* becomes *evil*.\n*Unconventional* means *strange*;\n*evil* means *perverse*—\nthe deeds of good and evil returning in cycles—\nare these not all deviations?\n\nOnly in stillness does the true origin stand upright,\nfor people accumulate much dust and filth in their deeds,\nfew possess a foundation of purity and emptiness.\nThus it is said: *\"There is no fixed upright.\"*\n\nThose who follow the *upright* are few,\nthose who set their own commands as *upright* are many.\nThe *upright* is not always *upright*—\nsuddenly it transforms and becomes strange,\nthus it is called *unconventional*.\nAll act in evil, unwilling to cultivate good,\nyet even if they pretend to do good,\ngood is not constantly good—\nit soon returns to evil.\nThus it is called *perverse*.\n\nThe people’s delusion has lasted long.\nDeluded by the source of calamity and fortune,\nbewildered by the paths of deviation and uprightness—\nthis is not a matter of days or nights,\nbut a long-standing habit.\n\nThus the Sage is square yet does not harm,\n*square* meaning *upright*,\n*harm* meaning *injury*.\nDeviant conduct injures both self and others,\nthe *Dao* of uprightness harms neither.\n\nHe is frugal yet not defiled,\nfor common emotions are greedy and turbid,\nthe Sage’s *Dao* is frugal and pure.\n\nHe is straight yet not overbearing,\nfor great straightness seems to bend,\nnot openly displaying the upright to others.\n\nHe shines yet does not dazzle,\nfor the bright *Dao* appears dim.\n\nHaving marked the errors of gain and loss in governance,\nthen pointing to the gates of calamity and fortune—\nthose drowned and bewildered are already many,\nthose lost in confusion have lingered long.\n*Perverse* and *unconventional* bind them in suffering,\n*foundation* and *hidden* offer paths of release and salvation.\n\nThus, frugal yet not defiled—\nbeginning with the *Dao* of purity and emptiness;\nshining yet not dazzling—\nonly then recognizing the source of benevolence.\n\nBlurring gain and loss—\nwhat calamity, what fortune?\nConfounding right and wrong—\nwho is deviant, who is upright?\n\nDrifting without attachment, without non-attachment,\nserene, without *can* or *cannot*.\n\n**Chapter 59: Governing People and Heaven, Nothing Exceeds the *Formula*.**\n\nTo govern below among the people,\nto serve above in Heaven—\nnothing surpasses using the *Dao/Way* as the *formula*.\n\nOnly the *formula* allows for early submission.\nUsing the *Dao/Way* as the *formula*,\nthings naturally incline to return.\nEarly submission is called \"laying down heavy *virtue/power*.\"\n\nThe *Dao/Way* is light, *virtue/power* is thin—\npeople do not lean toward what is light.\n*Virtue/power* deep and rich,\nthings themselves submit.\nLaying down heavy *virtue/power* means nothing is not conquered.\n*Virtue/power* heavy, benevolence profound—\nnothing is not overcome.\nConquer, overcome—\nto conquer without limit, none know its bounds.\nThe four quarters submit in homage,\nthe realm knows no borders—\nharmonized with the *Dao/Way*’s mysterious unity,\nwhat limits can there be?\nNone know its bounds,\nyet this is how one can have a realm.\nLand without borders,\n*virtue/power* without bounds—\nonly then can one truly establish a home and a state.\nThat which gives rise to a realm,\ncan endure forever.\nWith the *Dao/Way*, the realm is secure;\nwithout the *Dao/Way*, the realm is perilous.\nThe realm is born of the *Dao/Way*,\nthe *Dao/Way* is the realm’s mother.\nUsing the *Dao/Way* as mother,\nthis is how one endures long.\nThus, the *Dao/Way* of deep roots and firm foundations—\nenduring life, lasting vision.\n\nFor when roots wither, they are uprooted;\nwhen foundations rot, they fall away.\nNow, to govern the realm by taking the *Dao/Way* as root—\nthen the root is deep.\nTo cultivate oneself by taking *virtue/power* as foundation—\nthen the foundation is firm.\nA firm foundation ensures enduring life,\na deep root ensures lasting vision.\nThe *formula* for Heaven and humanity,\nthe key to state and family.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 60: Governing a Great Realm, Like Poaching a Small Fish.**\n\nA small fish, poached gently, does not break.\nBreak it, and the fish spoils.\nThus it is said:\nTo govern the realm with excessive interference brings chaos below;\nto cultivate oneself with excessive interference scatters one’s essence.\nUsing the *Dao/Way* to oversee the world,\nits spirits are not *divine/numen*.\nWhen a ruler uses the *Dao/Way* to govern below,\nthe spirits do not manifest their *numen* to harm people.\n\nNot that their *numen* is not divine—\ntheir divinity does not harm people;\nNot that their *numen* lacks divine power and does not harm people—\nit is because the ruler governs with the true *Dao/Way*,\nso that perversity cannot cause harm.\nNot that their divinity does not harm—\nthe sage does not harm.\nNot that their divinity and spirits cannot harm people—\nbut when the sage is above,\nhis *virtue/power* permeates the hidden and the manifest,\nand ghosts and spirits cannot cause harm—\nbecause the sage himself does not harm.\n\nWhen a person can benefit others,\nhe himself is not harmed.\nThus, when both do not harm each other,\n*virtue/power* flows in reciprocal harmony.\nThe sage and the spirits—\nthe two are such,\nboth able to benefit others,\nyet they do not harm each other.\nThe sage is benevolent and kind,\nthe spirits are upright and just—\nbenevolence shines in the open, smooth and radiant;\njustice dwells in the hidden, quietly amassing resources.\nBoth, through their *virtue/power* and grace,\nreturn to the people in reciprocal harmony.\n\nThe great realm is the confluence of the lowlands,\nthe gathering of all under heaven.\n*Confluence* means *assembly*.\nThe sea lies beneath all streams—\na hundred rivers there converge and return.\nTo govern a state, one must first examine oneself as if deficient,\nso that all nations may assemble in harmony.\n\nThe confluence of all under heaven is ever victorious through *yin*’s stillness over *yang*.\n*Yin* is receptive and still;\n*yang* is assertive and active.\nStillness can govern movement,\n*yin* can bend *yang*,\nthus knowing that humility, submission, and yielding\novercome arrogance and strength.\n\nTherefore, when the great realm humbles itself to the small,\nit takes the small;\nwhen the small humbles itself to the great,\nit gathers the great.\nWith humility as *virtue/power*,\none can embrace others.\nIf one cannot yet be humble and retiring,\none cannot take or gather.\n\nThus, sometimes one humbles to take,\nsometimes to gather—\nbinding two realms together.\n\nThe great realm seeks only to nurture others,\nthe small realm seeks only to serve.\nThe great realm further spreads the *Dao*’s noble influence,\nthe small realm seeks only to revere its transformative *virtue/power*.\nThe great, through its influence, extends its voice and teachings far;\nthe small, through its reverence, submits to rites and propriety.\nBoth fulfill their aspirations,\neach attains its desire.\nClothing and cap are one,\ninstitutions and systems align—\nyet still, the great may despise the small,\nthe noble may oppress the lowly.\nThus, the great must truly humble itself.\n\nThe *Dao* is the hidden essence of all things,\nyet the virtuous do not treasure it.\n*Treasure* means *value*.\nThe *Dao* is formless,\nits principle is emptiness and stillness.\nFormless, it encompasses all manifestations;\nemptiness and stillness, it embraces all movement and growth—\nthus it is called the hidden essence of all things.\n\nThe virtuous ruler, upright in essence,\ncan value truth.\nThe unworthy and foolish, following perversity,\ndespise the *Dao*—\nthus, some treasure it, others do not.\n\nFine words can earn respect,\nactions can elevate others.\nYet one who embodies the *Dao* forgets words;\ntruthful speech is not merely beautiful.\nElaborate arguments to justify falsehood\ncannot truly grasp truth.\nEmpty words, devoid of substance,\nhow can they be called the *Dao*?\nFlowery speech confuses the people,\ndecorating falsehood as truth.\nFrivolous theories disrupt the people,\nturning vice into virtue.\nSuch words may serve in marketplace transactions—\nhow can they convey *virtue/power* or embrace the *Dao*?\n\nThose who attain supreme *virtue/power*\nforget distinctions of self and other.\nThose who awaken to nature\nmerge into harmonious unity.\nHow can one exalt oneself while belittling others,\naffirm oneself while negating others,\nand place oneself above all things?\n\nThe unvirtuous—\nwhy abandon them?\nThe sage’s teachings are established\nto enlighten the ignorant;\nthe wondrous *Dao* spreads far,\nperfecting those yet unaware.\nTo make the unvirtuous virtuous,\nto make the ignorant wise—\nconstantly saving people,\nnever abandoning any.\nThus, the Son of Heaven is established,\nand the Three Ministers are appointed.\n\nIn the most ancient times, the pure and simple,\nthe wise and foolish were equal.\nTheir bodies did not stray from the *Dao*,\ntheir conduct aligned with nature—\nall treasured the *Dao*.\n\nFrom the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors onward,\nthings grew corrupt and muddled.\nWithout a ruler, people could not be guided;\nwith a sovereign, things could be transformed.\nThus, above, the *scholarly-officials* were appointed to assist the *hands-off ruler*,\nbelow, officials were set to discuss the *Dao*.\nThey were shown what was good and evil,\nadmonished with rites,\ntransforming the unvirtuous,\ncultivating pure winds.\n\nEven with jade discs and swift horses as tribute,\nit is not as good as advancing this *Dao*.\nIn ancient times, the *scholarly-officials* first presented jade,\nthen horses—\nthus, “with jade discs before swift horses.”\n\nThose who invert proper order\nmust be awakened from their delusions.\nThose who cling to folly\nshould be illuminated by wisdom’s measure.\nTo be the ruler’s inner counselors,\nthe sovereign’s pillars and arms—\ntheir duty is to rectify evil,\neasily propagating *Dao* and teaching.\n\nYet those who seek fame do not rest in their place,\narbitrarily aiming for improper honors.\nThose who crave favor do not act according to the *Dao*,\nonly seeking high rank.\nArrogance and extravagance bring self-inflicted ruin,\nleading to shared danger and destruction—\nbetter to cultivate the supreme *Dao*,\nremaining unmoved by honor or disgrace.\n\nWhy did the ancients value this *Dao*?\nNot to seek and obtain,\nnor to escape guilt with punishment.\nThus, it is most precious for all under heaven.\n\nFrom ancient times to today,\nwhy is this *Dao* so revered?\nBecause seeking it is not accomplished in a day,\npracticing it averts a hundred years of calamity,\nsecures blessings and fortune,\nand severs danger and ruin.\nThus, it is honored by all ages,\nvalued by both heaven and humankind.\n\nTo act without action,\nto manage without managing,\nto savor without savoring—\nto still restless movement,\nto concentrate the mind in tranquility.\nTo abandon excessive affairs,\nto empty oneself in naturalness.\nTo discard desires,\nto indulge in the mysterious and subtle.\n\nGreat and small, much and little—\nto repay resentment with *virtue/power*.\nResentment arises, sometimes great, sometimes small.\nEnmity emerges, sometimes few, sometimes many.\nOnce entangled in affairs,\none is bound by these ties,\nand resentment begets resentment without end.\nIf one returns to the great *Dao* of *wuwei*,\npreserves the burdenless naturalness,\nabandons this muddled world,\nand savors this pure emptiness—\nthen faults do not arise,\nresentment and enmity do not take root—\nthis is repaying resentment with *virtue/power*.\n\nDifficult arises from easy,\ngreat from small.\nThe world’s difficult matters\nmust begin with what is easy;\ngreat affairs must arise from what is small.\n*Arise* means *initiate*.\nAffairs begin with what is easy to achieve,\nthen grow difficult.\nThings in their growth\nalso proceed from small to great.\nTo remove great crimes,\none must first extinguish what is easy.\nTo eliminate great evil,\none must first curb what is small.\nIf the roots are cut,\nthe branches wither of themselves.\n\nLight promises lead to few fulfilled words,\nmany easy things lead to many difficulties.\nFirm speech must be kept—\nlight promises are empty.\nDifficulties arise from committing evil deeds,\nlife and death become easy to manage.\nUnlawful acts\nare difficult from beginning to end.\nThus, even the sage finds them difficult—\nand so they never arise.\n\nLightly undertaking evil deeds,\none steps into the causes of guilt.\nThe sage, wise and insightful,\nstill finds *action* difficult—\nthus, he attains the end without difficulty.\n\nHow much more so for the blind and ignorant,\nwho cannot act with gravity and caution—\nhow could they hope to escape calamity?\n\n**Chapter 64**\nWhat is settled is easy to uphold,\nwhat has not yet manifested is easy to plan.\n*Settled* means stillness,\n*Unmanifested* means the mechanism remains unstirred.\nDisasters are prevented,\nevils are stopped before they arise.\nTo remove evil, restrain it before it moves.\nTo avert misfortune, hold fast to stillness and tranquility.\nIf evil omens have no means to arise,\nand one does not plot against them, misfortune naturally vanishes—\nthis is what the superior sage calls preventing disaster.\n\nWhat is fragile is easy to shatter,\nwhat is subtle is easy to disperse.\nSmall crimes are easy to extinguish,\nlong-standing evils are hard to remove.\nIf one cannot prevent them before they move,\none must restrain them in their fragile, subtle state—\nthis is how the middle sage eliminates misfortune.\n\nTo act before it exists—\nthis is called \"what is settled is easy to uphold.\"\nTo govern before chaos arises—\nthis is called \"what is fragile is easy to shatter.\"\n\nA tree of embrace begins as a hair’s end;\na nine-tiered tower rises from a clod of earth;\na thousand-li journey starts beneath one’s feet.\nTo act is to court ruin,\nto grasp is to lose.\nA tree of embrace grows from small to great,\na nine-tiered tower ascends from low to high,\na thousand-li journey proceeds from near to far.\n\nIf one governs with stillness,\ncrimes never sprout from the hair’s end;\nif one stops them in their subtlety,\na single basketful of foundation is easily broken.\nIf one remains motionless and tranquil,\na thousand-li journey will never be completed—\nif one cannot act before it exists,\ngovern before it is disordered,\nand persists in artificial doing,\nruin and destruction are inevitable.\nClinging to evil deeds as correct,\none will inevitably meet with loss.\nThis is called the vulgar failing to act wisely,\nleading to ruin and destruction.\n\nThus, the sage acts without doing and thus knows no ruin,\nholds nothing and thus loses nothing.\nThe common man fails in immediate action,\nand thus suffers defeat and loss.\nThe sage perceives the critical moment in advance,\nand thus knows no calamity from action.\n\nMen’s undertakings often fail when nearly complete.\nTo finish as one begins,\nthen there will be no failed endeavors.\n*Critical* means near—\nordinary men commit evil and cannot remove it early;\nwhen evil is nearly complete,\nit is already too late to stop it.\nIf one can follow the sage’s path,\navoid danger and seek tranquility,\nbegin without wrongdoing,\nand end without guilt,\nthen there will be neither gain nor loss—\nwhat ruin, what success?\n\nThus, the sage desires not what others desire,\ndoes not prize difficult-to-obtain wealth;\nhe learns not what others learn,\nbut prepares for the errors of the multitude.\nMen follow their desires,\nholding wealth dear and the Dao cheap.\nThe sage does not eat,\nyet sinks pearls and casts jade as if they were mud—\nhis cultivation is not for himself,\nhis learning is for others.\nGreed for profit brings error,\ncontention for fame invites blame.\nThe sage, having no desires, discards profit,\nabandoning learning, forgets fame,\nnot flaunting his own abilities,\nbut guarding against the faults of others.\nHe aids the natural unfolding of all things\nwithout daring to act.\nThe nature of things\noriginates from spontaneity—\ndesire stains true nature with attachment,\nlearning obstructs the Way with distinctions,\nthus obscuring the source of unity,\nmaking the profound Dao hard to reveal.\nIf one does not enter *wuwei*,\none only returns to ruin and loss.\nThe sage reveals the original nature of things,\nnurtures all beings to preserve their truth,\ndares not act artificially,\nbut guides them back to emptiness and stillness.\n\n**Chapter 65**\nThe ancients who excelled in the Dao\ndid not seek to enlighten the people—\nthey sought to make them simple.\nTo teach the present age,\none must first invoke the ancients.\nThe ancients cultivated the Dao to refine themselves and govern the realm,\nnot employing cunning intelligence to deceive the heart or dazzle the people—\nthis was not to enlighten them.\nThey concealed their brilliance like light within a shell,\npreserved their purity like uncarved wood,\nquieted their discriminating wisdom—\nthis was to make them simple.\n\nThe people are hard to govern\nbecause they know too much.\nIf the ruler maintains simplicity,\nand the subjects return to naturalness,\nwithout resorting to threats or punishments,\nthey will naturally harmonize.\nIf one does not practice the empty, tranquil Dao,\nbut instead relies on clever, deceptive wisdom,\nthe more one knows, the greater the chaos—\nthus, it is hard to govern.\n\nTo govern with wisdom is to harm the state;\nto govern without wisdom is to benefit the state.\nClever, deceptive wisdom deeply harms the people—\nthis is the state’s ruin.\nSimplicity and naturalness, without knowledge,\nallowing things to unfold spontaneously,\neach attending to their own affairs,\nthe people content, families at peace,\nharmony between self and other,\nruler and subject all at ease—\nthis is the state’s virtue.\n\nKnow these two paths as models.\nTo always know these models\nis called profound virtue.\nProfound virtue is deep and distant,\ncontrary to the ways of the world—\nonly then does one attain the greatest harmony.\nTo use wisdom or not to use wisdom—\nthese are two paths.\nUsing it brings harm,\nnot using it brings no injury.\nTo know that the people suffer no harm—\nthis is the model for governing the state.\nTo know the model,\nto establish the foundation of the state and ensure its peace—\nthis is the subtlety of virtue.\n\nVirtue’s subtlety is unfathomable—*deep*,\nits pursuit cannot be attained—*far*.\nAll men use wisdom,\nbut this one uses simplicity—\nlearning to invert with the world.\nNot opposing the nature of things,\nletting them unfold naturally—\nthis is the greatest harmony.\n\nIt is also said that the Dao originates from emptiness and profundity,\nwhile the world defiles it with filth.\nTo conform to the world in seeking the Dao\nloses one to its falsity,\nbut to invert the world in cultivating virtue\nenters one into its subtlety.\nTo enter subtlety is to have neither what may nor may not be,\nto return to truth is to have neither what is communicated nor what is not.\nSince its response is empty and boundless,\nit attains great harmony and equality.\n\n**Chapter 66**\n\nThe rivers and seas become kings of all valleys\nbecause they excel in yielding.\nThus they become kings of all valleys.\n\nThis is a parable.\nBut the sea dwells in lowliness,\nso it becomes the king of all valleys.\n\nIt illustrates the Sage’s humility,\nmaking him the sovereign of all nations.\n\nThus, the Sage wishes to lead the people\nby speaking humbly;\nwishes to go before them\nby placing himself behind.\n\nThus, though he stands above,\nthe people do not feel burdened;\nthough he leads,\nthe people are not harmed.\n\nTo dwell humbly beneath all things is virtue,\nso he is exalted as supreme.\nTo retreat and guide others with the Dao,\nhe is honored as foremost.\n\nThe people willingly bear him as lord,\nnot feeling oppressed;\nall are loyal and filial—\nwho would dare harm them?\n\nThus the world delights in promoting him\nwithout tiring of it.\nBecause he does not contend,\nnone can contend with him.\n\nWithout virtue, all things reject him.\nWith the Dao, all willingly promote him.\nPracticing the customs of yielding and deference,\nfollowing the transformations of all things—\nwho would dare contend with him?\n\n**Chapter 67**\n\nThe world all calls me \"great\"—\nI am unworthy.\nOnly because I am great,\nam I unworthy.\n\nIf I were worthy for long,\nI would be small.\n\nThe Old Master’s Dao is exalted and honored,\ntruly worthy of being great.\nYet he conceals his traces with the common,\nhis hidden and revealed ways are unfathomable,\nnot resembling wisdom,\nnot resembling foolishness—\nthus he speaks of being unworthy and unlike.\n\nOnly the truly great Sage\nhas nothing to resemble.\n\nIf form has fixed qualities,\nwisdom has fixed measures,\nif there are things to resemble,\nif the Dao has opposites—\nthese are the petty and fragmented small men.\nHow could they be the boundless, transcendent Sage?\n\nI possess three treasures;\nI hold them fast.\nThe first is *cì* (慈, kindness),\nthe second is *jiǎn* (俭, frugality),\nthe third is *bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān* (不敢为天下先, not daring to go before the world).\n\nThe vulgar cherish profit,\nvaluing it with seven treasures.\nThe Dao rests in truth,\nweighting it with the three treasures.\n\nThe meaning of the three treasures\nis not something sought externally.\nIf one can be kind to all things,\ncherish life and abhor destruction—\nthis is the meaning of *cì*.\n\nLight taxes and frugal expenditures,\nhumble bearing and restrained use,\nneither extravagant nor ostentatious—\nthis is the meaning of *jiǎn*.\n\nForgotten self, aiding others,\nretiring to guide—\nnot daring to go before the world.\n\nHolding fast to these three,\npracticing them in conduct,\nthey bring peace to the state and security to the family—\ngreat treasures indeed.\n\nKindness makes one courageous;\nfrugality makes one expansive;\nnot daring to go before the world\nmakes one a vessel of completion.\n\nKindness toward things—\nthings do not harm you.\nThings not harming you—\nyou have no adversaries before you.\nBecause you have no adversaries,\nyou are called courageous.\n\nIf used extravagantly,\nit is insufficient for affairs;\nif practiced frugally,\nit suffices for governance—\nreaching far and wide,\nthus it is called expansive.\n\nExalted in humility,\nguarded in yielding softness,\nits virtue is universal,\nits humility radiant and ever-renewing,\nheld in esteem by all things—\nthus it becomes a vessel of completion.\n\nNow abandon kindness and courage,\nabandon frugality and expansiveness,\nabandon humility and going before—\nyou are dead.\n\nEarlier, those who possessed the three treasures\ndwelt in kindness and gained courage,\nheld fast to frugality and achieved expansiveness,\nremained behind and thus became foremost.\n\nNow those who lose the three treasures\ncannot practice kindness—\nthey hastily know courage;\ncannot uphold frugality—\nthey waste without measure;\ndo not understand humility and going behind—\nthey eagerly seek to go before others.\n\nTo love courage without kindness brings ruin;\nto use expansiveness without restraint brings hardship;\nto dwell before others without virtue brings danger—\nthus it is said: you are dead.\n\nKindness, when used in battle, conquers;\nwhen used in defense, it is steadfast.\nHeaven, about to save it, guards it with kindness.\nUsing kindness as principle,\nit does not lose its Dao.\n\nIn battle, it must overcome the enemy—\nthus it conquers.\nIn defense, it faces no collapse or peril—\nthus it is steadfast.\nWith kindness as heart,\nthe Mysterious Heaven protects it—\nthus it is said: Heaven saves it.\nThe utmost Dao preserves it—\nthus it is said: the Dao guards it.\n\nWithin, it clarifies right and wrong in conflict as battle,\ndispels delusion as victory,\nthe body does not lose its Dao as defense.\nTo align with the Dao for long is steadfastness.\nHarmony without harm—\nHeaven saves it.\nThings not injuring it—\nthe Dao guards it.\n\n**Chapter 68**\n\nThe ancients who excelled as warriors\nwere not martial.\nThey came to things with kindness,\nsubdued people with virtue,\ndid not fight with force,\ndid not delight in courage—\nwithout action, they transformed—\nthis is not martial.\n\nSkilled in war but not angry,\nable to quell rebellion and chaos—\nthis is skilled in war.\n\nSaving things with kindness,\nnot angry.\nSkilled in overcoming enemies without contending,\nthe Dao aids the world—\nthe four seas come to submit as king.\n\nVirtue soothes within,\nthe five weapons are not raised.\nThings are subdued without blades—\nthus it is said: skilled in overcoming enemies.\nWithout striving, naturally promoted—\nthus it is said: no contending.\n\nSkilled in using people as lowly,\nensuring people do not lose their natural forms,\nassigning things their proper roles—\nthis is skilled in using people.\n\nWide in tolerance, it gains the multitude;\nhumble, it incurs no blame—\nthus it is said: as lowly.\n\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention—\nthis concludes the above: not martial, not angry, yet able to overcome enemies.\n\nThis is called using people’s strength—\nthis concludes skilled in using people as lowly, people exerting themselves for it.\n\nThis is called aligning with Heaven—\nthe ancient ultimate.\n\nEmbracing things with the Dao,\nattracting the distant with culture.\nConquering without war,\nexalted without contending.\nIts virtue is vast and great,\napproaching Heaven above.\nIts transformation is pure and harmonious,\ncomparable to the ancient extreme.\n\nWithin, it clarifies the empty heart and full belly,\nsitting-forgetfulness merging with the Dao,\nnot relying on coercion or authority,\nno labor of courage or ferocity—\nthus it is said: the ancients who excelled as warriors were not martial.\n\nErasing the emotions of right and wrong,\nremoving the prejudices of love and hate,\nskilled in war but not angry.\nThings do not harm me,\nfollowing without resistance—\nskilled in overcoming enemies without contending.\n\nThe heart-king is tranquil,\nthe will rests in the void,\nears and eyes undisturbed,\nhands and feet unlabored—\nskilled in using people as lowly.\n\nIn accord with natural principle—\nthus it is said: aligning with Heaven.\nContracting the original source—\nthe ancient extreme.\n\n「Chapter 69: When employing forces, there are words to heed—\ndrawing from ancient military precepts.\n\nI do not dare to be the **host** but instead the **guest**,\nfor when within my own land I strike first, I am the host;\nwhen in the battlefield I move first, I am the host.\n\nTo strike first and move first is arrogance and excess—\na perilous state.\nNow I seek to preserve my whole,\nthus it is said: I dare to be the host.\n\nIn harmony yet not singing, following yet not leading—\nthus it is said: to be the guest.\n\nI do not dare advance an inch only to retreat a foot.\nI do not rely on military might to invade externally—\nthus it is said: I do not advance an inch.\nYet I rely on **accumulating virtue** to defend internally—\nthus it is said: I retreat a foot.\n\nThis is called **action without action**—\nforces arise from the other.\nI truly do not act,\nyet respond to things and act without effort,\nmoving without intent—\n**action without action**.\n\n**Repelling without arms**—\nanger drives the use of forces,\nand this is why one repels with arms.\nAs the guest, I retreat a foot,\nnot relying on arms to repel—\nthus it is said: **repelling without arms**.\n\n**Holding without forces**—\nharming the other without **Dao/Way**,\nthis is why one holds forces.\nForces are used to still forces,\npunishment is meted out to end punishment.\nNot yet losing **benevolence and righteousness**,\nthose who revere the Dao return of their own accord—\nthere are no forces to hold.\n\nNo greater calamity than **insulting the enemy**—\ninsulting the enemy nearly brings about the loss of my treasure.\n\nTo **kill without cause** is not to be done habitually,\nthough in times of conflict, the Dao values **mystery and stillness**,\nthus it is said: **govern things through non-action**,\nstrive to **settle the people**,\nand do not let harm arise.\nIf one retreats and loses the **Dao of non-action**#27,\nor advances without **stillness and subduing forces**#28,\nand **lightly insults the enemy**,\nthe state will collapse and the people perish—\na calamity most dire.\n\nA state with **abundant people and wealth**,\na **sage ruler and virtuous ministers**—\nthis is called **possessing the treasure**.\n\nWhen the people perish and the granaries are empty,\nwhen ministers are humiliated and the ruler is in peril—\nthis is near to losing my treasure.\nThus, when opposing forces are equal,\nthe **compassionate will prevail**.\n\nOpposing forces are equal when both sides mobilize their troops,\ntheir numbers and strength balanced—\nthus it is said: **equal opposing forces**.\nTo **lightly scorn the enemy** with no preparation,\nand to **covet victory yet love killing**—\nthis is inferior.\n\n**Stillness** must align with the **Dao/Way**,\n**action** must follow strict laws,\nnever losing **benevolence**—\nfor **benevolence** can govern things,\nand thus the **compassionate will prevail**.\n\nWithin, one knows **disturbances and afflictions** are manifold,\nand they cannot be broken without **wisdom**.\nTo expound their methods,\nthus it is said: **When employing forces, there are words to heed**.\n\nTo be the host must be **heroic and strong**,\nto be the guest must be **yielding and weak**.\nThose who would **still movement and return to stillness**,\nknowing to **guard strength with yielding**—\nthus it is said: **I do not dare to be the host but instead the guest**.\n\nIf one **ignores the Dao/Way** and **obscures it**,\nadvancing the **Dao/Way** is like retreating—\n**learning without true learning**,\n**practicing without true practice**—\nthus it is said: **I do not dare advance an inch only to retreat a foot**.\n\nUnderstanding that **all conditions are illusory**,\nrealizing that **both principles and teachings are empty**—\n**action without action**.\n\nNot only are all ten thousand phenomena **empty and tranquil**,\nbut also the self is **empty and pure**—\n**repelling without arms**.\n\nWithin, one **forgets wisdom**,\n**holding without forces**.\n\nExternally, one **severs emotional attachments**,\nand thus has **no enemies**.\n\n**Indulging emotions and extreme desires**,\nlosing the **Dao/Way** and ruining the self—\nthis is the loss of my treasure#29.\n\n**Wisdom** and **disturbances**,\nthese two kinds always follow one.\nOpposing forces are equal.\n\n**Skillful means** lie in **wisdom**,\n**subtle and unerring** in **compassion and benevolence**,\n**leakages exhausted** or **dispelled**,\n**serene and free of burdens**—\nthus the **compassionate will prevail**.\n\n**Chapter 70: My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice.**\nThe **sage** establishes teachings,\n**concise in words yet profound in meaning**,\nilluminating **principles and revealing their significance**—\nthus they are easy to know.\n**Embrace the One**#30, **free from myriad entanglements**,\n**non-action** **severing burdens**—\nthus they are easy to practice.\n\nYet none under Heaven can know them,\nnone can practice them.\n**Common emotions** do not conform to **mysterious teachings**,\n**cling to folly** and have not yet opened to **wisdom**,\nnot recognizing this **Dao/Way**—\nthus none can know them.\n**Lost in desires**, they do not **habitually practice non-action**,\nabandoning **rightness** to follow **evil**—\nthus none can practice them.\n\nWords have a **root**,\naffairs have a **master**.\n**Root** is **foundation**,\n**master** is **ruler**.\nTo take **virtue and power** as the foundation,\nits essence is easy to know.\nTo take **non-action** as the master,\nits essence is easy to practice.\n\nThose who **lose the foundation and chase the ends** are many,\nnot revering the **true root**,\nindulging emotions and defying nature—\nthese are the multitude.\nHow could they know that the **master** leads all and thus they are as such?\nThus it is said: **None under Heaven can know or practice them**.\n\nFor it is only because of **ignorance**,\nthat they do not know me.\nAll things are **dark and obscured**,\nwithin, there is not even a **hair’s measure of discernment**—\nthus it is said: **ignorance**.\n**Lost in principles**, they stray from the **Dao/Way**,\nexternally, they lack **wisdom in the ten thousand phenomena**—\nthus they do not know me.\n\nFew can **truly understand me**,\nthus I am **precious to those who do**.\nThe **busy and laborious**,\nwhat they value is **name**.\nThose who **ruin the multitude**,\nwhat they love is **profit**.\nFew can **embody the Dao/Way**,\nthus it is said: **Few can truly understand me**.\n\nIf one **does not return** from ruin,\nreturning is due to **the right path**;\nif one **wanders aimlessly** and does not **return**,\nreturning is entering **the true source**—\nthe **Dao/Way**.\nThus the **sage** **wears coarse robes yet holds jade within**—\n**conforming to the common** and **mingling with dust**,\nexternally demonstrating **humble attire**—\n**wearing coarse robes**.\n**Pure virtue** shines untainted,\n**white and radiant**—\n**holding jade within**.\n\n**Chapter 71: To know the unknown is superior**;\n\n**Chapter 72: Not knowing what one knows is an affliction.**\nTo know the empty and the full with wisdom,\nTo comprehend the true and the mundane with insight—this is *knowing*.\nWhat it illuminates is ever empty,\nIts discerning wisdom is ever still—\nNo knowing, no known, both vanish together,\nIllumination and object alike forgotten—this is *not knowing*.\nIlluminating yet without illumination,\nKnowing yet as if not knowing—\nThis is the **supreme virtue**.\n\nTo force knowing upon *not knowing* brings sickness,\nThe more one knows, the more one loses—\nIt harms the body, shortens life—\nThis is the affliction of knowing.\nThus the sage does not fall ill,\nFor he treats the affliction as an affliction—\nThus he does not fall ill.\nThe sage originally abandons knowing—\nThus he does not fall ill.\nHe pities those who suffer from forced knowing,\nFor he treats their affliction as an affliction.\nHe pities the multitude, though they labor in distinctions,\nYet remain unstained by dust—\nThus the sage does not fall ill.\nIt is also said: *He treats their affliction as an affliction*,\nMeaning the multitude is afflicted by the sickness of distinctions—\nThus it is said: *He does not fall ill*.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 73: The bold who dare are destroyed; the bold who do not dare live.**\nNot fearing is courage,\nFirmness of heart is daring.\nBefore the flashing blade, regarding death as life—\nThis is the courage of the noble.\nYet wisdom is not strategy,\nStrength is not mere prowess—\nTo rush forward for gain\nWill surely lose one’s life—\nThus it is said: *destroyed*.\nWithout contention, one must act with compassion,\nOr draw others with virtue and Dao,\nOr subdue things with wisdom and strategy—\nHarming none, preserving oneself—\nThus it is said: *live*.\nWithin, daring in voice and color destroys the body,\nNot daring in dust and defilement preserves oneself.\nThese two—one brings harm, one brings benefit—\nThis is *destroyed* and *live*.\n\nWhat does Heaven abhor, and who knows its reason?\nHeaven’s Dao loves life and abhors destruction,\nYet many cannot follow what benefits and avoid what harms—\nThis is because they do not recognize Heaven’s intent.\n\nHeaven’s Dao conquers without contention,\nIts will is without striving,\nYet naturally it is honored and takes precedence.\nIt responds without speaking,\nIt comes without being summoned—\nSpring gives way to winter, cold yields to heat,\nThose who depart were not sent away,\nThose who arrive were not called forth.\nYet it unfolds with perfect design.\nThe Great Dao is so simple—\nThus it is said: *unfolding*.\nIt weighs the gains and losses of all,\nIts rewards and punishments are precise,\nIts judgments of good and evil are without error—\nThus it is said: *perfect design*.\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide,\nThough sparse, it loses none.\nIt spreads through the boundless void,\nIt ensnares the manifest—\nWide and great, thus it is said: *vast*.\nCrimes, great or small, are all caught,\nNo offense escapes, no transgression is overlooked—\nThus it is said: *loses none*.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 74: If the people do not fear death, how can you frighten them with death?**\nWhen the age encounters the Dao,\nAll things cherish life,\nThe times belong to *wuwei*,\nAnd all hold life dear.\nIf one cannot govern them with supreme virtue,\nBut instead restrains them with harsh laws,\nPeople have no joy in living—\nThus it is said: *the people do not fear death*.\nThe people do not fear death\nBecause punishments are cruel—\nOne should instead pardon and employ virtue, forgetting laws.\nHow can you still use harsh measures to govern them,\nSeeking to frighten them with death?\nThis laments the errors of the age.\nIf one were to act strangely without fear of death,\nI would seize and destroy them—who would dare?\n*Strange* means deceitful, disorderly, and disruptive.\nIf the ruler follows the Dao,\nAll preserve their lives—\nThis is called *fearing death*.\nAs for those who forcibly oppress,\nDisrupting the order with their crimes,\nThe more strange and perverse they become,\nHeaven does not endure evil—\nThus I seize and destroy them.\nThose who fear death naturally avoid transgression,\nWho would dare to act wrongly while cherishing life?\nThere are always those who execute punishment.\n*Execute* means *master*—\nThe officials of life and death have their duties,\nThey cannot act arbitrarily—\nThose who break the law deserve death,\nYet one cannot presume to take it upon oneself.\n\n---\n\nThose who presume to execute punishment in place of the proper officials\nare like those who take the place of the master carpenter in hewing.\nIf one takes the place of the master carpenter in hewing,\none will hardly avoid injury to one’s own hands.\n\nThough the **Dao/Way** of Heaven may seem distant,\nits mysterious discernment is most clear.\nIt rewards the virtuous and punishes the wicked,\nmanifest in the **Suffering Officials** of the underworld.\n\nSpring brings forth life, summer nurtures its growth,\nyet these are entrusted to visible substitutes.\nIf the governance of the age cannot rely on Heaven’s natural order\nbut instead substitutes it with human contrivance,\nit is already straying from the Dao.\n\nYet even so, the stubborn few may follow transformation,\nwhile the cunning many are hard to guard against.\nAdapting to the times is proper,\nand establishing laws to restrain them—\nthere are always those who enforce punishment,\nthose who hold authority over life and death.\n\nIf one does not entrust punishment to its proper officials,\nand does not act through its rightful **masters**,\nthen those who execute punishment arbitrarily\nare like clumsy men taking the place of skilled artisans.\nThere will surely be injury to their hands,\nand few will escape harm—\nthe injuries will be many indeed.\n\n**Chapter 75**\nThe people’s hunger stems from their rulers’ excessive taxes,\nthus they suffer hunger.\nWhen the common folk are starving and destitute,\nwhen the four classes are burdened and exhausted,\nit is not due to other causes—\nonly heavy taxes and rampant banditry.\n\nThe people are hard to govern because their rulers act unnaturally,\nthus they are hard to govern.\nTo act unnaturally is to obstruct the people,\nand this is why governance is difficult.\nTo govern naturally and uprightly,\nthe people will easily be transformed.\n\nThe people’s disregard for death comes from their rulers’ excessive indulgence in life,\nthus they hold death lightly.\nThose who cling to life weigh their fleeting gains above true virtue,\nwhile those who scorn death drown in false affections.\nTo take what has life\nand nourish a hollow, artificial existence—\nthis is what is meant by *excessive indulgence in life*.\nExcessive means accumulated, means excessive.\nWhen desires accumulate, the mind is disordered;\nwhen pleasures are excessive, the palate grows weary,\nand one cannot cherish life with proper reverence to preserve it.\nTo indulge recklessly and destroy oneself—\nthis is the path to holding death lightly.\n\nOnly those who do not cling to life\nare truly able to **honor** life.\nTo cling to life as something of value,\nyet to nourish it beyond its proper measure,\nultimately leads to harm—\nthis is not yet to **honor** life.\n\nThose who attain the **Dao/Way** see the body as not truly theirs,\nwho understand the principle of **non-being**,\ndo not perceive the illusory form of life,\nand naturally shed the burdens of false attachment.\nThey align with the **emptiness** and **purity** of the **Dao/Way**,\nsharing the same root of **virtue/power**.\nThough they do not cultivate life,\nlife sustains itself—\nthis is what it means to truly **honor** life.\n\n**Honor**, here meaning *capable of*.\n**Honor**, here meaning *to value highly*.\n\n「Chapter 76: Human life begins in softness and weakness,\nyet death manifests in rigidity and strength.\nUnder heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than **qi**,\nand nothing is softer and weaker than the **Dao/Way**.\nThus, when a person is born,\nthey must draw upon the **Dao/Way** and **qi**.\nWhen **qi** remains, bending and straightening are at one’s own command;\nwhen the **Dao/Way** is present, movement and stillness are governed by **spirit** (*shén*).\n\nThe heart follows without resistance,\nactions proceed without hindrance,\nhence the saying of softness and weakness.\nIf **qi** cannot be preserved,\nits exhaustion brings death to the body;\nif the **spirit** is not yet liberated,\nits departure means life’s end.\nWhen life’s end comes and the body perishes,\nthere is no further movement—\nhence it is called rigidity and strength.\n\nAll things, grasses and trees,\nbegin life as tender and fragile,\nyet in death become withered and brittle.\nSentientless beings—\nthose with **qi** live, those without **qi** die.\nThus, it is known that among beings with awareness,\nthose who grasp the **Dao/Way** belong to the category of softness and weakness,\nwhile those who lose the **Dao/Way** fall into rigidity and strength.\n\nTherefore, rigidity and strength are the followers of death,\nwhile softness and weakness are the followers of life.\nBinding the above with sentient and sentientless beings,\nthe two principles of birth and death,\neach has its own category of adherents.\n\nHence, armies grow strong yet cannot conquer,\ntrees grow strong yet are felled.\nNot relying on **virtue/power** but on arms to be strong—\nthis is violent to all under heaven who love life,\nyet hated by all things.\nGathering few to make many,\nsupporting weak to make strong,\nand then attacking together—\nthere will be those who cannot conquer.\n\nThus, when a tree grows strong,\nits branches and leaves flourish above;\nwhen a pillar grows strong,\nits beams and supports are steadied below.\nBy this analogy, I explain:\nto seek **virtue/power** in softness and weakness,\nnot to adorn oneself with arms for rigidity and strength.\nSo, rigidity and strength reside beneath,\nwhile softness and weakness dwell above.\n\nLife is what all rejoice in;\nsoftness and weakness are the followers of life—\nis this not the highest?\nDeath is what all grieve over;\nrigidity and strength are the followers of death—\nis this not the lowest?\n\nChapter 77: The **Dao/Way** of heaven\nis like a drawn bow.\nHuman affairs are near and shallow,\nfaced yet their true nature remains unseen;\nthe **Dao/Way** of heaven is distant and profound,\ngazed upon yet its principle cannot be fully comprehended.\nThe confused cannot know it,\nthe correct **Dao/Way** is difficult to discern—\nthus, I borrow the analogy of the drawn bow.\n\nThe high are lowered,\nthe low are raised,\nthe excessive are diminished,\nthe insufficient are supplemented.\nThe **Dao/Way** of using a bow:\nthe high fear overshooting,\nso they are lowered lest they be too high.\nThe low fear falling short,\nso they are raised lest they be too low.\nNeither too high nor too low,\nthis is the middle—what is expected.\n\nFor those who govern a state,\nthey diminish the excess of wealth,\nsupplement the lack of poverty.\nThe poor, though benefited, remain poor,\nthe rich, though diminished, remain rich.\nNeither poor nor rich,\nthis is the middle in the governance of a state.\n\nToo high risks the emptiness of the void,\nso it is lowered lest it be void.\nToo low risks stagnation in deficiency,\nso it is raised lest it be deficient.\nNeither deficient nor void,\nthis aligns with the middle **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of heaven\ndiminishes the excessive and supplements the insufficient.\nI explain the **Dao/Way** of heaven through this analogy.\nBut human affairs are not so:\nthey diminish the insufficient to serve the excessive.\nThis is to say that human actions contradict the **Dao/Way** of heaven,\nand cannot diminish the strong to benefit the weak,\nnor reduce the rich to augment the poor.\nWho can have excess to serve all under heaven?\nOnly those who grasp the **Dao/Way**.\n\nWho can follow the **Dao/Way** of heaven in their conduct,\ndiminishing the full to supplement the humble?\nOnly the **Dao/Way**-aligned ruler can know this.\n\nThus, the sage acts yet does not rely on it,\nachieves yet does not possess—\nthis is not to value the worthy.\nThe sage cultivates **virtue/power** without expecting its rewards,\ncompletes things without claiming its merits.\nThis is so because they wish to conceal their sage **virtue/power**,\nand obscure their worthy talents.\nSince the highest act thus,\nthe lowest naturally follow.\nThe calamity of seeking fame is removed,\nthe pity of valuing the worthy does not arise.\n\nChapter 78: Under heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than water,\nyet nothing can surpass it in overcoming rigidity and strength—\nit cannot be replaced.\nObserving all things,\nsummarizing all existence,\nthe utmost softness and weakness\nis water above all else.\nIt melts metal and stone,\nerodes hills and mounds—\nnothing can surpass water,\nwater is the most victorious.\n\nTo overcome rigidity and strength, one must imitate water.\nSince it is victorious,\nit cannot be replaced.\nFor those who govern a state,\nif they can take humility as **virtue/power**,\nand the **Dao/Way** as their method,\nthey can overcome strong enemies,\nsubdue the mighty—\nand the **Dao/Way** will be the foremost,\nthus nothing can replace it.\n\nFor those who cultivate themselves,\nif they can uphold the utmost **Dao/Way** of softness,\nthey will naturally break the rigidity and strength of self and others,\nand grasp the utmost principle of **emptiness** and **purity**.\nThey will transcend the disputes of right and wrong.\nOnly the **Dao/Way** is victorious,\nnothing can substitute for it.\n\nThus, softness overcomes rigidity,\nweakness overcomes strength—\nthis concludes the previous discussion.\n\nUnder heaven, none can know it,\nnone can practice it.\nMany love rigidity and strength,\nfew preserve softness and weakness,\nunable to humble themselves,\nstriving to be first among all things.\n\nTherefore, the sage says:\nTo bear the state’s filth,\nthis is called the master of soil and grain;\nTo bear the state’s misfortunes,\nthis is the ruler of all under heaven.\nCorrect words, yet reversed in meaning.\nEmbodying the **Dao/Way** of softness and weakness,\nthen all things are contained within.\nUnderstanding the realm of the profound and mysterious,\nthen all affairs are naturally received.\nSuppressing wrongdoing without stifling virtue,\nbearing the state’s filth—\nblaming oneself and taking responsibility,\nbearing the state’s misfortunes—\nthis is fitting for being the master of all things,\nhence the saying: the ruler of all under heaven.\n\nThis is contrary to common practice yet in accord with the **Dao/Way**,\nthus it is said: correct words, yet reversed in meaning.\nFilth (*nòu*) is impurity.\nMisfortune (*xiáng*) is virtue.\n\nFor those who cultivate themselves,\nthough they experience impurity and purity,\nthey forget both purity and impurity.\nThough they traverse virtue and vice,\nthey harbor both vice and virtue equally.\nIlluminating the original **emptiness** of a single principle,\nrealizing that all realms are empty—\nthis can achieve the **Dao/Way**,\nand become the **Dharma King** (*Fǎwáng*).\n\nCommon practice regards filth, purity, virtue, and vice\nas all having existence,\nbut observing through the **Dao/Way**,\nall are seen as **emptiness**—\nhence it is said: reversed.\n\nChapter 79: Reconciling great grudges\nwill inevitably leave lingering grudges—\nhow can this be considered good?\nWhen self and others are equal and unified,\nright and wrong do not arise.\nWhen distinctions and conflicts abound,\ngrudges and enmities naturally flourish.\nThus, ritual has the principle of repaying grudges,\nlaw has the penalty of death for retribution.\nGrudges past and present cannot be extinguished,\nyet if one seeks to extinguish grudges and reconcile them,\nthey must eliminate hostility to achieve harmony,\nturn wrongdoers to virtue,\nand guide them from evil to goodness.\n\n「Yet though one’s words are good and one’s heart is not,\none outwardly complies while inwardly dissenting—\nif the heart is not good and compliance is not sincere,\nthe lingering grudges will only grow worse,\nand thus further evil will arise—\nhow can this be called good?\n\nIf one truly seeks to be good,\nit is better not to harbor grudges at all.\nIf one does not harbor grudges,\nwhy must one seek reconciliation and harmony?\nThen there is neither hostility nor opposition.\nHostility and opposition forgotten,\ngrudges and enmities naturally cease.\n\nTo not know that goodness is goodness,\nonly then can it be named **ultimate goodness** (*zhìshàn*).\n\nThus, the **Sage** (*shèngrén*) holds the **left token** (*zuǒ qìe*—a pledge of trust),\nand does not blame others.\n\nIn ancient times, the **Sage** carved wooden tokens,\nthe ruler kept the left half,\nthe subject kept the right half as a sign of faith.\nWhen the tokens were matched,\nno further legal punishment was imposed,\nand no blame was given to others.\nHence it is said: **\"virtue/power\"** (*dé*) governs tokens,\nwhile lack of **\"virtue/power\"** governs their separation.\n**Govern** (*sī*) means **to oversee**; **tokens** (*qìe*) mean **to unite**; **separation** (*chè*) means **to part**.\n\nWhere **\"virtue/power\"** presides,\nabove it unites with the **Dao/Way** of **non-action** (*wúwéi*—effortless alignment),\nblending into a silent, singular harmony,\nbelow it is where all things converge,\nthe tokens of trust sealed in faith.\n\nIf one lacks **\"virtue/power\"**, unable to act in goodness,\nnot only does one fail to unite with the **Dao/Way**,\nbut one also causes **dispersion** (*liú sǎn*) among the masses.\nHence, it is said: **\"virtue/power\"** governs tokens,\nwhile lack of **\"virtue/power\"** governs separation.\n\nThe **Heavenly Dao/Way** has no favorites,\nalways aligning with those of **\"virtue/power\"** (*shànrén*).\nThe **Heavenly Dao/Way** is balanced and equal,\nwith no distinction of near or far—\nthe wicked stray from its path,\nthus earning the name **\"distant\"** (*cū*).\nThe good draw near to truth,\nthus earning the name **\"close\"** (*qīn*).\n**Ultimate truth** (*zhìlǐ*) speaks in plain words,\nneither distant nor close—\nonly when the good act in **\"virtue/power\"** and goodness\ndoes Heaven bestow its blessings#38,\nhence it is said: the **Heavenly Dao/Way** aligns with the good.\n\nYet it does not align with the wicked—\nthus one knows that **\"virtue/power\"** aids **\"virtue/power\"**, not those lacking it.\nIf one can act in **\"virtue/power\"** and goodness,\nthen **\"virtue/power\"** and goodness will naturally return to them.\n\nChapter 80: In a **small state with few people** (*xiǎo guó guǎ mín*),\n\nthough they possess **tenfold and hundredfold implements** (*shí bǎi zhī qì*—tools, weapons, or instruments),\nthey do not use them...」\n\nThe Sage governs the state through the **Dao/Way of non-action**,\nand though military implements—whether few or many, tenfold or thousandfold—exist,\nthey are all unused.\nA small state does so; how much more so a great one!\n\nLet people hold death in reverence and not flee far.\nWhen governance has purpose, life becomes light.\nWhen transformation follows **non-action**, all revere death.\nFathers protect their children, wives do not lose their husbands,\neach finding joy in their work and dwelling in peace—\nno more wandering or fleeing.\n\nThough carriages and boats exist, they are not used.\nFor what need is there of boats on water?\nOr carriages on land?\nIn the age of **non-action**, mountains lack paths or tunnels,\nmarshes lack bridges or ferries.\nThe source cuts off coming and going—\nwhat need is there for riding?\n\nThough armor and weapons exist, they are not deployed.\nWeapons are used to punish rebels,\nmartial might to quell chaos.\nWhen the ruler follows the **Dao/Way**, the people cherish **virtue/power**.\nTransformation follows naturally—\nwhat need is there for arraying troops?\n\nLet the people return to using knotted cords for records.\nIn ancient times, before writing was invented,\nknots on cords were used for governance.\nOnce writing arose, frivolity increased,\nand though sages taught, the principle remained **non-action**.\nThey wished to return to simplicity, discard ornamentation,\nand embrace reality.\nLet their food be plain, their clothing simple,\ntheir dwellings secure, their customs joyful.\nWhen hearts are content, coarse food and rough garments suffice as delight.\nNow the Sage’s transformation surpasses the Great Pivot—\nno distinction between noble and common,\nall food is savory,\nall clothing beautiful,\nall dwellings secure,\nall homes filled with joy.\nNo one flees far—\nthe weak and the dying are naturally cut off.\nNeighboring states are visible to the eye,\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs heard in ears,\nyet from beginning to end,\nfrom youth to old age,\nthey do not visit one another.\nTwo states as neighbors,\nvisible to the eye,\nroosters crowing, dogs barking—\nyet from start to finish,\nfrom young to old,\nthey do not come and go,\neach self-sufficient, each home complete.\nThus it is said:\nPeople forget each other in the **Dao/Way**,\nfish forget each other in rivers and lakes—\nthis is what is meant.\n\n**Chapter 81:**\nTruthful speech is not ornate,\nornate speech is not truthful.\nSpeech reveals the heart—\nnot for idle fabrication,\nbut to uphold true principle,\nnot for empty words.\nThus, truthful speech is not ornate.\nSweet words betray truth,\nlight promises lack sincerity—\nthus, ornate speech is not truthful.\n\nThe good do not argue,\narguers are not good.\nGreat eloquence seems stammering,\nwithout labored words.\nThe good do not argue.\nOne-sided speech overreaches,\nmany words lead to exhaustion—\narguers are not good.\n\nThe wise are not learned,\nthe learned are not wise.\nIf you know one thing,\nall things are complete—\nthe wise are not learned.\nWhen form overshadows substance,\nlearning drowns the mind,\ntrue principle is forgotten.\n\nThe sun and moon shine their light,\nilluminating all peaks,\nthings gain sight and their brilliance increases—\njust as the Sage’s wisdom penetrates all things,\nand their teachings extend endlessly.\nRivers and seas nourish all things,\ngiving life while their source never runs dry—\njust as the Sage’s generosity is inexhaustible.\n\nThe **Dao/Way of Heaven** benefits without harming,\nthe **Dao/Way of the Sage** acts without contention.\nHeaven’s **Dao/Way** bestows life—\nthis is benefit.\nIt always rescues people without harm.\nContention arises from the heart,\naction from circumstances.\nThe Sage has no heart—\nthus naturally no action.\nWhen action is none,\n**non-action** is also none.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is ever **non-action** yet nothing remains undone.\nThe **Ultimate Dao/Way** is profound and still,\ntrue reality unmoved—\nthis is **non-action**.\nYet it responds to things and moves,\nits transformation reaching everywhere,\nadapting to all forms—\nhow could it lack anything?\nThrough myriad expedients, it does all things.\n**Non-action** yet doing—\nstillness is not always still,\naction is not always active.\nWhen action is not always active,\nrest returns to stillness;\nwhen stillness is not always still,\nmovement arises from stillness.\nStillness is itself movement—\nit does not remain in stillness;\nmovement returns to stillness—\nit does not remain in movement.\n**Ultimate truth** speaks:\nTransformation is not stillness.\nAll beings can move and can be still—\nknow that movement and non-movement\nare neither movement nor non-movement.\nProclaim this **non-doing** as neither doing nor not-doing.\n\nIf kings could uphold it,\nall things would naturally align.\n**Virtue/power** subdues all things,\nthe **Dao/Way** is present—thus they are honored.\nKings who uphold the **Dao/Way** do not command alignment,\ndukes who cherish **virtue/power** do not enforce transformation.\nYet if transformation falters and action arises,\nI shall suppress it with the **uncarved block of the Nameless**.\n\n*\"Action\"* means to stir—\nthose who cannot follow transformation\ndesire to stir the heart toward **action**.\nWith the **uncarved block of the Nameless**, suppress it—\nthe heart of **action** will naturally cease.\nPreserve the **Dao/Way**, nurture simplicity,\nembrace the uncarved, hold to purity.\nThe **uncarved block of the Nameless**—\nit too will not desire.\nIts principle is empty yet substantial,\nits essence neither true nor false,\nneither mundane nor abandoned.\nOnly the stirring of desire is the ailment—\nthe Sage uses the **uncarved block of the Nameless** as the remedy.\nThe remedy removes the ailment;\nwhen the ailment is gone, the remedy is forgotten.\nThus, the **uncarved block of the Nameless**—\nit too will not desire.\nOr rather, the **uncarved block** with a name—\nhow could it not desire?\nWith no desire, all is still—\nthe world naturally aligns.\nUsing wisdom to govern is a state’s ruin,\n**action** disrupts things, which are ever in motion.\nIf the ruler can hold to stillness and **non-desire**,\nthe people need no ordering and will align themselves,\nall nations require no commands and will correct themselves.\nIf inner clarity abandons these burdens,\nreturning to the Nameless—\nif desire still arises,\nthen peace is lost, and the **Dao/Way** is forsaken.\nNow, neither the burdens to abandon nor the Nameless to grasp are seen—\nwhen taking and discarding are forgotten,\ndesire does not arise.\n\n---\n\nWhen desire does not arise, stillness comes naturally.\nWithout **heart-desire**, one aligns with the **Dao/Way**—\nthus, the **Dao/Way** and stillness naturally harmonize,\nand it is said that the world naturally aligns.\n\n*Laozi’s Dao De Jing, Volume Two #1*\nThis volume’s title is conjecturally added by the editor.\n\nThe base text for this volume’s commentary is reconstructed from the Dunhuang manuscripts P.2594, P.2864, S.2060, P.3237, P.2577, and P.3237.\nThese six manuscripts originally formed one continuous scroll; after reassembly, the tail remains intact, while the head still shows slight lacunae.\nThe missing portion includes commentary on *Dao De Jing* Chapter 38 and partial verses from Chapter 39, supplemented by the *Dao De Jing’s Mysterious Virtue* (Qiande Zanshu) attributed to Liang Siqi (hereafter referred to as the Liang text).\n\nThe Dunhuang

upper volume to the end of Chapter 81 in the lower volume, reflecting differing interpretations of the *Laozi* text among Tang scholars.\nSome hold that the eighty-one chapters symbolize the number nine of the Yang, representing the *Dao* as heaven and the *De* as earth.\nHeaven has four seasons, hence the *Dao* volume contains thirty-six chapters.\nEarth has five phases, hence the *De* volume contains forty-five chapters.\nThus, Chapter 37 was relocated to follow the *De* volume, to correspond with the numbers of heaven and earth.\nSee Dong Sijing’s *Collected Commentaries on the Mysterious Dao De Jing* (preface).",

      "translated_text": "**The *Daode Zhengjing Zhu* (Commentary on the *True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*)**\n\n**Title and Attribution:**\n*The Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*. Composed by the Daoist Li Rong during the Tang High Zhen period. The original text comprised two scrolls. Two fragmentary versions now survive:\n1. *The Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), under the *Dongshen* (Cavernous Gods) section of the *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) category, preserving the original preface and commentaries on thirty-six chapters of the Dao scripture, arranged in four scrolls.\n2. A Dunhuang fragmentary manuscript, containing commentaries on the *Dejing* (Virtue Classic) forty-four chapters and the thirty-seventh chapter of the Dao scripture. Though combined, the two texts remain partially incomplete.\n\nThe present edition collates the *Daozang* version with the Dunhuang manuscript, supplemented by the *Daode Zhengjing Xuande Mushu* (Mysterious Virtue and Profound Commentary on the *True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*) by Qiang Sici (hereafter, the Qiang Edition), reconstructing a complete text. The original work lacked chapter divisions; these have been added according to the standard transmitted version.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the *Daode Zhengjing***\n\nThe Daoist subject Rong humbly speaks:\n\nI have heard that the silent and tranquil precedes the primal heaven,\nYet the heavens lack brilliance to reveal its splendor.\nThe undifferentiated gives rise to things,\nYet the myriad things are insufficient to fathom its subtlety.\n\nThis is the transcendent and ineffable—\nBeyond all forms, yet profound and boundless.\nIt traces the profound workings of the Cosmic Potter,\nAnd its principle lies in the responsiveness of the Void.\nIt unfolds the hidden paths of the Craftsman-Guide,\nAnd its meaning resides in the numinous diagram.\n\nThus, the sacred scriptures of the Celestial Village\nEstablish communion with the Imperial Symbols before their manifestation;\nThe True Sovereign of Ku County\nReveals the august origin of the numinous spirit.\n\nFive thousand years of blessings descend,\nAnd the mystic wind manifests in harmony with the Celestial.\nThe twin pillars flow with divine destiny,\nAnd the purple qi shines upon the Imperial Throne.\n\nI humbly observe that Your Majesty,\nWith jade-like virtue compiling the sacred,\nAnd golden gates responding to the diagram,\nIlluminates the radiance across the waves of the luminous mirror,\nWhile auspicious vapors drift over the peaks of longevity.\nYou nurture the divine at Fen River,\nAnd with the Great Compass alone transform—\nSeeking the Dao at the Yellow River’s banks,\nAnd practicing supreme benevolence without domination.\n\nThe sacred texts of the numinous caves\nYou personally labor to revere,\nAnd the secret scrolls of the Immortal Metropolis\nYou graciously peruse with sagacious insight.\nConcentrating at the Yellow Court to embody the subtle,\nAnd bathing in the Dark Feminine to flow with humility,\nYou thus attain the stillness of the *Niqishang* (Rainbow Robe) wind,\nAnd sever the transformations of the *Kunhai* (Dark Sea) with non-action.\n\nExamining the scripture, I see that the Sage governs\nBy attending to affairs of non-action,\nAnd practices the teaching of unsaid words.\nIt is also said: *\"The Sage governs by emptying the mind and filling the belly.\"*\nThese anterior and posterior numinous confirmations\nAre as if seals fitting together.\n\nAncient and modern masters\nDo not clarify the profound intent,\nFor the divine spirit has yet to behold the Sage’s concentrated stillness.\n\nNow, the Heavenly Opening of Your Majesty’s heart\nShines brightly and distinctly—\nTruly the manifestation of the primal transformation of Great Peace,\nUnfolding before the ages,\nAnd establishing the supreme function of non-action,\nDisplaying auspicious omens for a thousand generations.\n\nHow could it merely echo the *Hetu* (River Diagram) records,\nTransmitted in vain since the Han,\nOr the vermilion inscriptions of the Shang,\nMerely preserving the characters of the Zhou?\n\nIts words are subtle yet profound,\nIts principles profound yet distant.\nLike gazing upward to the *Xīhé* (Sun God),\nWhere the six voids shine uniformly,\nOr being moistened by the Supreme Good,\nWhere all things harmonize.\n\nThus, past sages and virtuous worthies vied to explore its depths,\nWhile Wei-Jin scholars of brilliance faltered at the threshold of being and non-being.\nQi-B Liang Daoists erred in admonishing and encouraging within the domain of non-trace.\nThose who merely echoed it were enshrouded in mist,\nTalking of nothing but emptiness;\nThose who wandered astray were lost in vaporous illusions,\nFirmly grasping at existence.\nSome merely touched upon the upper mechanism,\nLeaving it incomplete,\nWhile those clinging to petty knowledge\nMade it verbose without simplicity.\nThus, this single scripture has spawned a hundred commentaries,\nConfusing the Daoist winds like chaotic alarms,\nAnd mingling the *Jing* and *Wei* (clarity and muddiness) in the sea of wisdom.\nAssisting the age and guiding customs,\nSometimes obstructing the Dao’s gate,\nPiercing the void yet failing to unlock the key of emptiness.\n\nI, Rong, though my years are devoted to the Dao,\nAnd my name recorded in the elixir registers,\nHave rinsed my heart in the pure stream yet it is not still water,\nAnd though I face the dark stone, my mirror hangs askew.\nDwelling among the red cinnamon and white cassia,\nI have long listened to the fragrant winds,\nDancing and singing by the Green Stream,\nYet my back has been exposed to the Tang sun in vain.\n\nWith my inflated nature,\nI twice received the words of perspiration and toil,\nAnd thus dared to wield the jade scepter in the Purple Court,\nAnd listen to the golden decrees upon the Vermilion Steps.\nThough I frequently engaged in lofty discourse,\nMy inner sincerity remained unexpressed.\n\nFor the vast abyss of the Three Mountains\nI drift upon the Lynx Isle without measuring its depths;\nFor the nine wells of the flowing spring,\nI gaze upward at the Dragon’s virtue as if it still existed.\n\nDaring to exhaust my mediocrity,\nI venture to compose this commentary.\nThough I strive night and day,\nMy understanding is but a drop in the ocean,\nYet like the mountain’s foundation supporting the clouds,\nI hope to achieve something in the ant-hill of the world.\n\nMay I not merely imitate the myriad wonders,\nBut aspire to the formless symbol of the Dao’s pearl.\nWith dust clinging to the imperial canopy,\nI fear the depths of the abyss.\nWith utmost trepidation,\nI humbly present this offering.\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on the *Daode Zhengjing* – Scroll One**\n\n**Chapter 1**\n*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.*\n\n*The Dao*—this is the principle of the utmost void.\nTo discuss the principle of the utmost void,\nOne cannot divide its manifestation into being and non-being,\nNor can one measure its truth with high and low.\n\nThus, the utterly profound transcends prior cognition,\nAnd the utterly real cannot be grasped by mundane understanding—\n*\"Mysterious, yet difficult to ponder;\nProfound, yet impossible to fathom.\"*\n\nThe Sage wished to lay bare this profound path,\nAnd opened the gate of teaching,\nBorrowing the name *Round and Penetrating* (圓通)\nTo designate the principle of the utmost void.\nSince the principle can be named,\nAnd the named can be called *Dao*,\nIt is said: *\"I do not know its name; I call it Dao.\"*\n\n*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao*—\nThis is not the common, mundane Dao of humanity.\nThe common, mundane Dao of humanity\nIs honored through rites and propriety,\nValued for its superficial brilliance,\nWhere one sacrifices the self for fame,\nAnd forgets the self for gain.\nHaving lost the Dao and its virtue,\nThis teaching now prevails.\n\nNow, having discarded the superficial trappings of benevolence and righteousness,\nAnd taken the substance of Dao and virtue,\nCeasing frivolous conduct and returning to the pure source,\nReversing habitual emotions—\nThus, it is called *the Dao that is not the eternal Dao*.\n\n**The name that can be named is not the eternal name.**\n*The name*—this is the designation of the Great Dao.\nI forcefully name it: *\"Great!\"*\nA name does not stand alone;\nIt arises from the substance.\nA character does not exist independently;\nIt is established by virtue giving form to principle,\nAnd in its operation, it does not stagnate—\nEncompassing all, it reaches the boundless.*",

      "translated_text": "**The Dao That Can Be Named**\n\nThus, with the name of the Great Dao,\nI proclaim its essence,\nSo that all things may understand it.\nHence, it is said: *\"The name that can be named.\"*\n\nThe name that is not the eternal name—\nThis is the name of vain worldly glory, not the true.\nTherefore, I reject it as *not the eternal Dao*,\nSo that one may abandon the transient and return to the eternal truth.\n\nNames arise from causes,\nAnd wisdom progresses by gradual or sudden stages.\nTo open the way with principles,\nOne seizes the transient to grasp the eternal truth.\n\nWhen laid out to its ultimate conclusion,\nThere is no eternal Dao to seize,\nNor is there a true eternal to take.\nNot only is it not the eternal Dao,\nBut it is also not the transient.\nIf it is not the transient, then the eternal is transient,\nAnd if it is not the eternal Dao, it is also not the transient.\nThus, the eternal and the transient are both beyond grasp.\n\nBefore names arose, Heaven and Earth began.\nWith names, all things took form.\nThe Dao’s virtue is profound and mysterious,\nIts principle transcends existence and non-existence.\nSince existence and non-existence are transcended,\nNames are cast aside.\n\nYet the function of boundless emptiness—\nWhere can it not apply?\nTherefore, though it is not existence, it exists,\nAnd the nameless is the origin of the two *complementaries*.\nThough it is not non-existence, it is non-existent,\nAnd the named is the parent of all things.\nHence, the Dao generates virtue and nurtures,\nThis is what is meant.\n\nTo observe its mystery, one must be ever without desire.\nTo observe its subtlety, one must be ever with desire.\nAll who receive life\nDraw their origin from Dao and virtue,\nShare the same *qi* from Yin and Yang,\nYet their clarity and obscurity differ in spirit,\nTheir stillness and agitation differ in nature.\n\nIf one smooths the heart and stills the path,\nWashes the will in the mysterious depths,\nThen desires cannot disturb the spirit,\nAnd distractions cannot cloud the intention—\nThe luminous *spirit platform* is clear and still,\nThe profound *mirror of the Dao* is deep and bright—\nThen one may perceive the faintest traces,\nComprehend the subtlest mysteries.\nThis is the *conduct of without desire*.\n\nIf one cannot yet abandon the mind,\nAnd remains bound to the realm of existence,\nChasing after right and wrong,\nAgitating over sounds and colors,\nThen one is merely caught in the affairs of existence,\nAnd does not recognize the principle of non-action.\nThis is the *conduct of with desire*.\n\nSubtlety is a trace, a return, a coming.\nThis means relying on Dao and virtue for conduct,\nObserving profound principles to enter the cycle—\nLosing the emptiness and stillness, calling them false,\nAnd staining oneself with coarse methods, drifting into subtlety and traces.\nThese two arise from the same source yet bear different names.\n\nSpeaking closely,\nWith desire and without desire—these are the two.\nThis is called *humanity*.\n\nAll share the same substance of the Five *Eternal Virtues*,\nAnd all possess the same *mind of an inch*.\nThey are the same.\nTo dim the sharpness and embrace tranquility,\nTo pierce through the Dao’s source,\nThis is to attain the profound.\nTo compete with prior knowledge and be entangled in confusion,\nTo sink into the world’s realm,\nThis is to drift into subtlety.\nThese are the differing names.\n\nSpeaking broadly,\nThe sages sought to expound the principle of boundless emptiness,\nThus taking Dao and virtue as their core.\nTherefore, in this chapter,\nThey vividly illuminate this meaning,\nAnd pair it with Dao and virtue.\n\nHence, it is said:\nThough the two bear mixed and obscure principles,\nThey are one in essence.\nThe movement arising from stillness,\nThe use emerging from substance,\nHence, it is said: *they arise*.\nThe function of the Dao’s generation,\nThis is the *Dao itself*.\nThe meaning of nurturing,\nThis is the *virtue* made manifest.\nDao and virtue bear distinct names,\nThus, it is called *differing names*.\n\nThe profound is said to be the same.\nThe Dao of emptiness and stillness,\nThe profound virtue of mystery,\nIs not easily discerned,\nAnd its silent depth is not easily spoken.\nNo one can name it,\nSo it is called *the same*—\nThe mystery of the most profound mystery.\n\nWithout anything to establish,\nOnly the Dao and virtue can speak of the profound,\nHence, it is said: *\"The profound virtue is deep and distant,\nThe ultimate Dao is profound and still.\"*\n\nThe profound beyond the profound,\nIs the gateway to all mysteries.\nDao and virtue are remote and obscure,\nTheir principle surpasses words and forms.\nThe true core is empty and profound,\nTheir affairs transcend existence and non-existence.\n\nBorrowing speech beyond words and forms,\nRecording the marks of existence and non-existence,\nTo traverse the hidden path,\nHence, it is said: *\"The profound beyond the profound.\"*\n\nYet fearing those lost in direction may cling to rigid principles,\nAnd those who lose the principle may cling to fixed dogmas,\nIf one lingers here and calls it the true Dao,\nHence, it is said in its utmost terms:\nIt is not the mark of existence and non-existence,\nSo the name is called *profound*—\nBorrowing *profound* to cast off existence and non-existence.\nOnce existence and non-existence are cast aside,\nThe profound is also lost,\nHence, it is said: *\"The profound beyond the profound.\"*\n\nThe profound beyond the profound—\nThree reversals are not enough to speak of its extremity,\nFour phrases cannot fully convey its source.\nBoundless and unobstructed,\nIt encompasses the pivot of all phenomena,\nAnd opens the windows of a hundred spirits.\nThis is the gateway to all mysteries.\n\n**Two Chapters**\n\nAll under Heaven know *beauty* when it is called *beauty*,\nThen *evil* has already arisen.\n*Beauty* is *joy*.\nIt is said that humanity’s inherent nature\nCannot take the Dao as delight,\nBut takes desire as joy.\nJoy cannot be exhausted,\nAnd when joy reaches its peak, sorrow comes.\nDesire cannot be indulged,\nAnd when desire is indulged, the nature is harmed.\nHence, it is said: *\"All take sounds, colors, flavors, and tastes as supreme joy.\nThey do not know that sounds, colors, flavors, and tastes\nAre the greatest calamities of the *Great Uncarved Block*.\nOnce they become calamities of the *Great Uncarved Block*,\nThey also become the roots of sorrow.\nTo extinguish the nature and harm the body—\nThis is where *evil* arises.\"*\n\nAll know *good* when it is called *good*,\nThen *not-good* has already arisen.\nUnder Heaven and upon Earth,\nNoble and ignoble alike,\nFew can empty the heart and the self,\nYet all indulge desire and emotion.\nThough their loves differ,\nEach follows their own emotions—\nLoving names, they call names *good*;\nLoving gain, they call gain *good*.\nTo love gain as *good* is to seek gain without the Dao;\nTo love fame as *good* is to court fame to the point of self-destruction.\nThough it conforms to emotion, it is *not-good*.\nHence, the Master of *Bountiful Virtue* died for fame atop *Chief Yang*,\nAnd the Bandit *Zhi* died for gain beneath the *Eastern Mound*.\nThis is where *not-good* arises.\n\nHence, existence and non-existence give rise to each other,\nAll things under Heaven are born from existence,\nExistence from non-existence.\nFrom non-existence comes existence,\nAnd from existence returns non-existence.\nThus, it is said: *\"They give rise to each other.\"*\n\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nFor all difficult matters under Heaven\nMust first be made easy.\nDifficulty arises from ease,\nAnd ease accomplishes difficulty.\nEase arises from difficulty,\nAnd difficulty completes ease.\n\nLong and short take shape from each other,\nFor things separated have neither great nor small,\nBut gathered, they have short and long.\nThe *Great Mountain* and the *autumn hair* differ in proportion,\nThe *white crane* and the *green duck* differ in leg length—\nHence, it is known:\nTo avoid them is to have neither great nor small,\nTo preserve them is to have short and long.",

      "translated_text": "High and low incline toward each other—\n*Incline* means *danger*.\nWater can bear a boat,\nYet also overturn it.\nThe high relies on the low as its foundation,\nBut the low is as perilous as the high.\nThough the low is humble,\nIt yet endangers the high;\nThe high, though noble,\nIf it truly annihilates the low,\nThen when the *Dao* is lost, high and low endanger each other,\nBut when the *Dao* is attained, both ruler and subject find harmony.\n\nSound and voice harmonize together—\nThe ruler transforms the people below,\nLike wind swaying the grass.\nThe people follow the ruler above,\nLike echoes answering sound.\nIt is like the *gong* and *shang* notes,\nAlternately singing in harmony.\nIf the pitch is too high, the strings will snap;\nIf the ruler is too hasty, the people will grow restless.\nThus, when the Five Tones are in accord,\nThe Eight Sounds are perfectly attuned,\nAnd when governance is harmonious,\nThe people rejoice.\nHence it is said: *\"The sovereign is the people’s teacher,\nAnd the people take him as their model.\"*\n\nBefore and after follow in sequence—\nThe ruler acts first, and the minister follows;\nThe father acts first, and the son follows.\nThus, those who rule as fathers and sovereigns\nMust not act lightly or lose the heart of the *Dao*,\nBut should instead uphold stillness\nAnd align with *virtue*.\n\nTherefore, the Sage governs\nBy doing nothing yet achieving all,\nBy teaching without speaking,\nWhile all things act without complaint.\nGazing back through the ages,\nSome are coarse, some refined.\nSurveying the hundred kings,\nTheir steps were sometimes swift, sometimes slow.\nNone have inscribed their titles on golden tablets,\nNor recorded their deeds in royal annals.\nThe Emperor responds to the thousand-year cycle,\nAnd upholds the seven-hundred-year foundation,\nWithout wielding arms,\nYet takes joy in boundless fulfillment—\nThus, the sacred lineage shines far beyond its beginnings,\nAnd its destiny is sealed before form takes shape.\nHence it is said: *\"The Sage governs by doing nothing.\"*\n\nMighty generals stabilize the four quarters by upholding *威*,\nMinisters and officials govern by discussing the *Dao* and clarifying affairs—\nTheir influence is not through words alone.\nHence it is said: *\"They teach without speaking.\"*\n\n*Action* is what is spoken of here—\nThe four classes each fulfill their duties,\nAll things retain their true nature,\nAnd follow transformation naturally,\nWithout resistance or complaint.\nTo give birth yet not possess,\nTo entrust to *spontaneous transformation*,\nTo use without knowing—\nTo act yet not rely on it,\nTo treat all things as *chúgǒu* (sacrificial straw dogs),\nNot claiming *virtue* as one’s achievement.\nWhen success is attained, one does not dwell on it.\nThough adorned with splendor,\nOne remains detached and distant—\nSeeking the *Dao* beyond *Xiāngchéng*,\nAnd focusing the spirit toward *Gūshè*.\nOnly by not dwelling does one not depart.\nThe *Dao* pervades the universe,\nWhile *virtue* encompasses the Two Principles.\nThough *virtue* avoids functional display,\nThe people revere it.\nWith effortless governance, the Nine Regions are pacified,\nAnd through *wuwei*, the myriad states come in tribute,\nThe spirit ever serene.\nHence it is said: *\"It does not depart.\"*\n\n**Chapter Three:**\nNot to exalt the worthy\nMakes the people not contend.\nThe *Wang Dao* is vast and impartial,\nNobles and commoners alike are like jade and stone in the same dust,\nThe worthy and the foolish share the same rope—\nThis is the transformation of the *Great Dao*,\nWhere there is no contention.\nThe worthy must be placed in their proper station,\nRewards must be given for merit,\nThe foolish must be assigned to labor,\nPunishments must be meted for offenses.\nIf rewards exceed merit,\nExcess leads to arrogance and extravagance.\nIf labor exceeds capacity,\nPoverty and exhaustion follow.\nArrogance and extravagance breed deceit and violence—\nEven beasts, when cornered, will fight—\nThus, contention arises.\nHence the sun and moon shine impartially,\nNot altering their light for the worthy or unworthy;\nHeaven and Earth cover and nourish all,\nNot lightly changing their ways for the good or evil.\n\n**Chapter Four:**\nNot to prize rare treasures\nMakes the people not steal.\nAbandon the jade of ten cities,\nCast aside the pearls of a thousand gold,\nRegard them as tiles and rubble—\nWho would steal?\nIf desires are unseen,\nThe heart remains undisturbed.\nThe ears do not hear the *Zhèngwèi* zither and pipes,\nThe eyes do not see the beauties of *Páo Sì* and *Dá Jǐ*,\nThe heart is purified, the self cleansed,\nEmotions abandoned, desires forgotten—\nWho would be disordered?\nThus, the Sage governs\nWith unified *virtue* and accumulated *ren*,\nPerfecting goodness and beauty.\nThe *Laozi* wished to exalt the Sage’s *virtue*,\nSo he spoke of this as well:\nEmpty the heart,\nEliminate desires,\nSever right and wrong,\nAbandon myriad concerns,\nPreserve the One Truth.\nFill the belly,\nHold the *Dao* in the breast,\nLet *virtue* fill the inner self.\nWeaken the will,\nSoftening the heart to follow the *Dao* without resistance.\nStrengthen the bones—\nOnly when the *Dao* gathers in emptiness,\nWhen the empty heart embraces the *Dao*,\nWhen the *Dao* resides where there is no harm,\nDoes one attain the strength of the *xian*.\nAlways keep the people ignorant and desireless,\nSo that the wise dare not act.\nTo act with *wuwei* is to govern completely.\nAbove, spread the winds of *wuwei*,\nBelow, cultivate the pure and simple transformation.\nWhen the people follow above,\nAnd both high and low are at ease,\nThen there is no transformation that cannot be transformed.\n\nThe *Dao* is boundless yet used—\nOr it does not overflow.\n*Boundless* means *central*.\n*Overflow* means *full*.\nThe *Dao* is not a partial thing;\nIts use must lie in the center.\nHeaven abhors fullness—\nFullness invites loss,\nHence it is said: *\"It does not overflow.\"*\nFullness must have deficiency,\nEmptiness must have substance.\nThe *Dao* of central harmony\nIs neither full nor deficient,\nNeither having nor lacking.\nHaving and lacking are not true,\nFullness and deficiency are not real—\nBorrowing the medicine of the central path\nTo cure the ailments of the extremes.\nWhen the illness is gone, the medicine discarded,\nWhen the extremes are removed, the center forgotten,\nThere is nothing left at all.\nThis is also the meaning of *\"not overflowing.\"*\n\nDeep as the sea, it seems the origin of all things.\nThe sea is deep, so all streams flow toward it.\nThe *Dao* is deep, so all things revere and serve it.\nDull its sharpness—\nForeknowledge harms nature,\nProlonged evil harms others—\nThis is *sharpness*.\nWith an empty heart and forgotten self,\nThe *Dao* bends it—this is *dulling*.\nUntangle its confusion—\nDesires disrupt propriety,\nGain and loss confuse the heart—\nThis is *confusion*.\nAbandoning the other, forgetting the self,\nDistant from desires, controlling emotions—\nThis is *untangling*.\nHarmonize its brightness,\nBlend with the dust—\nSerene, as if it might exist.\nBright yet not dazzling,\nStained yet not blackened,\nHarmonious yet not obscured in form,\nBlended yet not burdened in truth.\nThus, it is known:\nSerene and tranquil, it remains ever present.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nYet it precedes the Emperor.\nThe *Dao* is profound and mysterious,\nA boundless abyss—\nEven *迎* and *随* cannot fathom its end.\nHow then can it be defined?\nHence it is said: *\"I do not know whose child.\"*",

other,\nRight and wrong oppose each other—\nThis is the natural *Dao*.\n\n*Virtue* is love,\nAnd where there is love, there is hatred.\nHeaven and Earth act without intention,\nSevered from love and hatred.\nBecause they love not,\nThey are called without *virtue*.\n\n*Chúgǒu*—\nStraw shaped into a dog,\nUsed in ancient rites,\nThen discarded.\n\nIt is said of people toward *chúgǒu*:\nThey use it without loving,\nAbandon it without hating.\n\nThis illustrates how Heaven and Earth,\nWarm as spring’s spontaneous harmony,\nAre not called *virtuous*,\nCold as autumn frost’s descent,\nAre not called *righteous*.\n\nThe Sage is without *virtue*,\nTreating the people as *chúgǒu*.\nThe Sage acts without intention,\nMerging in *virtue* with Heaven and Earth.\n\nWithout *virtue*, the meaning of *chúgǒu* is clear.\nThough grace nourishes grass and trees,\nBenevolence covers swine and fish,\nPropagating wind and unfolding transformation,\nIt must first benefit humanity—\nHence, \"the people.\"\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nIs it not like the *tuóqiè*?\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nMoving yet ever flowing.\n\n*Tuó*—the bellows.\n*Qiè*—the flute.\n*Yielding*—exhaustion.\n*Interval*—the space between.\n\nThe *tuóqiè* is hollow within,\nThus it emits sound and breath without exhaustion.\nHeaven and Earth are hollow within,\nThus they generate all things without end.\n\nIf one can empty the heart and body,\nDeploying wisdom and *virtue* without limit,\nThere is no exhaustion.\n\nMany words lead to ruin,\nBetter to hold to the center.\n\n*Ruined*—confined.\nAs if filling the

error,\nGain and loss are not in excess.\n\nNow, many words lead to ruin—\nA warning against the loss of speech,\nEncouraging adherence to the center’s gain,\nSo that teaching is unobstructed and words forgotten within.\n\n**Chapter Six**\nThe *Gu* spirit does not die—\nThis is called the **Mysterious Female**.\nThe *River Above* said:\nNurturing the spirit is the method of *thinking-preservation*.\n\nHúisì remarked:\nThe emptiness within the valley—\nThis is metaphorical language.\n\nThough true sages’ lofty insights\nAre all explanations of things,\nNow we simplify the principle and attempt to speak.\n\n*Gu*—emptiness.\n*Xuan*—the *Dao*.\n*Pìn*—stillness.\n\nWith form and spirit, there is a master.\nWith birth and death, the *Dao* cannot be spoken of—\nFlowing, unstable, how can it be called still?\n\nIf one can empty form and spirit,\nAbandoning self and object,\nExhaling rootless *qi*,\nGathering without calling it birth,\nInhaling windowless *qi*,\nDispersing without calling it death—\nNeither death nor birth—\nThis is the *Dao* of the *Gu* spirit.\n\nBirth and death are unstable things.\nDeep, feminine, still—\nThis is the meaning of the *Mysterious Female*.\n\nThe **Gate of the Mysterious Female**—\nThis is the root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe *Dao* in stillness—\nFormless, without attributes.\nWhen it moves,\nIt generates Earth, generates Heaven.\n\n*Qi* manifests from here,\nThus it is called the **Gate**.\nHeaven and Earth depend on it to live,\nThus it is called the **Root**.\n\nEndless, as if it exists—\nUsing it is effortless.\n\n*Endless*—subtle and wondrous.\nThe *Dao* of the *Mysterious Female*\nNeither generates nor perishes,\nThe principle of feminine stillness\nNeither exists nor vanishes.\nTo speak of existence—no form is seen,\nTo speak of vanishing—all things are born.\n\nNeither flourishing nor decaying,\nNeither constant nor severed—\nThus, *endless*.\n\n*Effort*—toil.\nObtaining the *Dao* of the *Mysterious Female*,\nIts use is boundless, effortless leisure.\nThus, it is said: *effortless*.\n\n**Chapter Seven**\nHeaven endures, Earth persists.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth endure and persist\nIs that they do not generate themselves,\nThus they can endure and persist.\n\nThe sun and moon revolve and thin,\nTheir waxing and waning cannot be halted.\nYin and Yang contract and expand,\nThe cycles of cold and heat pass easily.\n\nAll things beneath them are insufficient,\nThus Heaven and Earth alone endure.\n\nExamining the *virtue* of Heaven and Earth,\nAsking the reason for their longevity,\nNone but the heartless,\nThe selfless in generation.\n\nIf one can model Heaven and Earth,\nActing without intention,\nNurturing without self-interest,\nThe bones of the Immortal will surpass gold and stone in endurance,\nThe *command* will embrace the square and round in permanence.\n\nIf one cannot abandon right and wrong to align with the *Dao*,\nDiscard emotions and desires to condense the *True Self*,\nThen deaf and blind to sound and color,\nNumb to fragrance and flavor,\nThe body toils externally,\nThe heart wearies internally—\nThen a hundred years are like morning dew,\nA thousand gold like evening dust.\n\nThus it is said:\nPeople’s disregard for death\nComes from their thickened vitality—\nThus they disregard death.\n\nHence the Sage places himself last,\nYet his body is first.\nHe sets himself aside,\nYet his body persists.\n\nFew abandon emotions and extinguish schemes,\nMany pursue desires and betray the *True Self*.\nOnly the Sage knows and acts.\n\nThis is acting in humility to dwell among things,\nPlacing *virtue* last so as to be first in honor,\nPreserving the *Dao* externally so the body persists with it.\n\nNot that he lacks selfishness—\nThus he fulfills his selfishness.\n\nOrdinary emotions are obscured,\nThe numinous awareness is clear.\nWithout a heart of utter impartiality,\nThere are actions of partiality.\nExalting self while burdening others,\nEnriching self while impoverishing others,\nDesiring to lead yet unable to surpass others,\nSeeking to preserve yet the body already lost.\n\nThe Sage, without intention,

reverence.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\nThe ancients who excelled as scholars\nWere subtle, mysterious, and penetrating,\nDeep beyond recognition.\n\nThe Dao of old was hard to walk,\nYet the wise of antiquity could cultivate it.\nThe Dao is subtle, essential, and wondrous,\nMysterious, still, and empty—\nIts practice is extreme, reaching the utmost subtlety,\nUnobstructed, with no stagnation.\n\nWhen practice aligns with the Dao,\nIt is unfathomable and hard to know.\nIt cannot be spoken of with words—\nHe who speaks of it does not grasp the Dao;\nIt cannot be recognized with recognition—\nHe who recognizes it strays from truth.\nThus it is said: *It cannot be recognized.*\n\nSince it cannot be recognized,\nWe forcefully give it form—\nForm, meaning appearance.\nThe Dao is hard to ponder,\nIts practice hard to discern—\nFearful that later scholars may lack the means to embody the Dao,\nStudents may not know how to establish and walk it,\nBelow, we briefly outline its appearances\nTo encourage and exhort.\n\nLike one crossing a river in winter—\nStepping on thin ice,\nFearful of sinking into the depths,\nThe living fear danger,\nTrembling, not daring to act

full\nCan one be depleted and yet renewed.\n\nThose who establish themselves do not aspire to fullness,\nAssisting with loyalty and rectitude—\nThough aged, they return to youth,\nIn depletion, like rebirth.\n\nLearners of the Dao empty their hearts of sounds and colors,\nWash away worries and dissolve entanglements—\nThough in a decaying body and corrupt world,\nThey yet attain fulfillment in the true Dao.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\nTo perfect emptiness, to firmly hold stillness.\nIts nature is still and true,\nIts practice clear and distant.\nThose who guard it deeply\nMay attain the Dao of perfect emptiness.\n\nAll things arise together—\nCommon people cannot guard *wu*,\nTaking ease and stillness as the emotions’ movements,\nAbandoning truth for falsehood,\nLosing the root and chasing the branches.\nI observe their return.\n\nReturn—root.\nCommon people lose the root and chase the branches,\nAbandoning purity for frivolity.\nThe Sage suppresses the branches and honors the root,\nTurning frivolity back to simplicity.\n\nThings, teeming and diverse,\nEach return to their root.\nThings—also people.\nRoot—also the root.\nSpeaking of people with one heart clinging to myriad realms,\nTheir affairs are not singular—\nThus it is said: *teeming and diverse*.\nThe Sage all encourages returning to the root,\nThus it is said: *each return to their root*.\n\nReturning to the

Dao and its manifestations align naturally,\nwithout need for binding cords or records,\nwalking the Great Way,\nhow could one rely on written contracts?\n\nWhen the times are in harmony with the One,\nthus they speak of the Dao’s flourishing.\n\nPracticing partial love as benevolence,\napplying censure of wrong as righteousness,\ncorruption and shallowness become the norm—\nunable to walk the

may be barred or unbarred,\nbut if governed by the Dao,\nthere is no closing—\nnor any opening.\n\nThus, the ruler of the realm governs the people with the Dao,\nleaving no way for spies to peer.\nThe cultivator refines himself with the Dao,\nleaving no path for desires to breach.\n\nGood binding needs no rope or knot to tie,\nyet cannot be undone.\nThose who bind with ropes know of tying and untying,\nbut if the Dao governs the four quarters,\nthis is true binding.\nAll under heaven unite beneath one—\nit cannot be undone.\n\nThe cultivator must align with the Dao,\nthus it is said: good binding.\nHolding to One without separation,\nit cannot be undone.\n\nTherefore, the Sage is always good at saving people,\nand so no one is abandoned.\nWhen one thing loses its place,\nhis heart aches with care—\nhe views all as his children.\nHow could there be abandonment?\n\nThe True Sage expounds the scriptures to enlighten,\nresponds to karmic impulses to guide the common,\nand rescues with the Dao—\nnever leaving any behind.\nAlways good at saving things,\nthus nothing is abandoned.\nFrom beginning to end, the Dao is applied—\nthus it is said: always good.\n\nJoy reaches all under heaven—\nthus it is said: good.\nVirtue can broadly rescue—\nthus it is said: save.\nSpeaking of all things—\nthus it is said: things.\nThis is called *Clothing the Bright*.\n\nPracticing these five virtues,\nboth people and things are rescued.\nFollowing the Dao and applying it—\nthis is called *Clothing the Bright*.\n\nThe good man is the teacher of the unvirtuous.\nThe unvirtuous are the resources of the good.\nWhen conduct aligns with the Dao,\nvirtue can benefit others—\nthis is the good man.\nThe model for all people,\nthe standard for all things—\nthis is the teacher.\nThe dim seek the bright,\nthe bright do not seek the dim.\nThey receive them to serve,\nand provide them with offerings—\nthese are resources.\nIf one does not honor the teacher,\nnor cherish the resources,\nthough one may know great confusion,\nthis is called the *Essential Mystery*.\n\nTo revere the teacher and honor the Dao—\nthis is honor.\nTo be kind and persuasive—\nthis is love.\nThe meaning of resources demands honor and love,\nbut if the teacher does not love the resources,\nthe dark flow is blocked and does not nourish,\nand the resources do not honor the teacher.\nThe path of kindness is difficult to return—\nthe enlightened grasp this mystery,\nthe benighted fall into great confusion.\n\n**Chapter XXVIII**\nKnowing the雄 yet guarding the雌,\none becomes the valley of all under heaven.\nNot flattering, not arrogant,\ndwelling in moderation—\nthis is the conduct of the gentleman.\nNot still, not agitated,\ndwelling in harmony—\nthis is the foundation of the Dao.\n\nThus, those who harbor雄 and fierce intentions\ncannot be fully true.\nThose who embrace雌 and yielding nature\ncannot aspire to the Dao.\nNow, knowing one’s雄 nature yet guarding the雌,\none neither agitates nor acts hastily.\nSimilarly, knowing one’s雌 nature yet guarding the雄,\none neither stagnates nor delays—\navoiding extremes, naturally aligning with the Middle Way.\n\nYet those who act with雄 and fierceness are many,\nwhile those who guard雌 and yielding are few.\nThus, the analogy: the Han River and valleys dwell low,\nand all streams flow toward them.\nThe virtuous and refined retreat in humility,\nand morality flows to them.\nConstant virtue never departs,\nreturning to the infant’s state.\nWithin, no distinctions or judgments—\nthis is the conduct of the innocent child.\nIf one can always guard stillness,\nconstantly aligning with virtue,\nthis is not departing.\n\nSmall things lack emotion,\ngreat things have desires—\nabandoning the great awareness of maturity,\nreturning to the childlike ignorance of infancy—\nthus it is said: returning.\n\nKnowing the white yet guarding the black,\none becomes the model for all under heaven.\nGreat whiteness seems like disgrace,\ngreat wisdom seems like folly—\nretiring to preserve oneself,\nthis is the law.\n\nConstant virtue does not err,\nreturning to the boundless.\n*Err* means to deviate—\nnot to dazzle others with wisdom,\nnot to harm oneself for fame,\nthough inwardly pure,\nexternally appearing as dust.\nHe who establishes himself receives boundless blessings,\nhe who cultivates the Dao attains the boundless.\n\nKnowing honor yet guarding disgrace,\none becomes the valley of all under heaven.\nHolding office and rank—honor.\nHaving no position, no name—disgrace.\nIf one can know how to dwell in display without arrogance,\nand guard humiliation with humility,\nthis is to contain all things,\nbecoming the valley of all under heaven.\n\nTo be the valley of all under heaven,\nconstant virtue is sufficient,\nreturning to simplicity.\nIn nobility, act as the humble;\nin honor, appear as the disgraced—\nthe true and constant virtue naturally overflows.\nConstant virtue returns,\nthus it is said: returning to simplicity.\n\nSimplicity scatters to form vessels—\nthe Sage uses them as officials and leaders,\nthus the great order knows no cutting.\nBefore differentiation, there is simplicity.\nThe Three Powers have their places—vessels.\nFrom the formless to the manifest,\nthus it is said: scattering simplicity to form vessels.\nThe high and low of Heaven and Earth are established,\nthe noble and base of ruler and subject are clear—\nplanting the ruler as the root,\nthus it is said: officials and leaders.\nOverseeing all under heaven,\nthus it is said: great order.\nAbove, nurturing like a parent,\nbelow, ensuring no harm—\nthus it is said: no cutting.\n\nPity extends to all things,\nand all things are preserved—\nno cutting.\n\n**Chapter XXIX**\nIf one seeks to take all under heaven by force,\nI see that it cannot be done.\nNon-action and non-doing\ncan govern all under heaven.\nIf one acts with doing and force,\nI see that it cannot be done.\n\nAll under heaven is a divine vessel—\nit cannot be seized.\nSeizing it brings ruin,\ngrasping it leads to loss.\nIf one instead shares all under heaven’s goodness,\nwithout privatizing its benefits,\nremoves all under heaven’s harm,\nwithout claiming its rewards,\nthen the four seas bathe in virtue and drink in harmony,\nand all things follow transformation, rejoicing in customs—\nthus

there converge and return.\nTo govern a state, one must first examine oneself as if deficient,\nso that all nations may assemble in harmony.\n\nThe confluence of all under heaven is ever victorious through *yin*’s stillness over *yang*.\n*Yin* is receptive and still;\n*yang* is assertive and active.\nStillness can govern movement,\n*yin* can bend *yang*,\nthus knowing that humility, submission, and yielding\novercome arrogance and strength.\n\nTherefore, when the great realm humbles itself to the small,\nit takes the small;\nwhen the small humbles itself to the great,\nit gathers the great.\nWith humility as *virtue/power*,\none can embrace others.\nIf one cannot yet be humble and retiring,\none cannot take or gather.\n\nThus, sometimes one humbles to take,\nsometimes to gather—\nbinding two realms together.\n\nThe great realm seeks only to nurture others,\nthe small realm seeks only to serve.\nThe great realm further spreads the *Dao*’s noble influence,\nthe small realm seeks only to revere its transformative *virtue/power*.\nThe great, through its influence, extends its voice and teachings far;\nthe small, through its reverence, submits to rites and propriety.\nBoth fulfill their aspirations,\neach attains its desire.\nClothing and cap are one,\ninstitutions and systems align—\nyet still, the great may despise the small,\nthe noble may oppress the lowly.\nThus, the great must truly humble itself.\n\nThe *Dao* is the hidden essence of all things,\nyet the virtuous do not treasure it.\n*Treasure* means *value*.\nThe *Dao* is formless,\nits principle is emptiness and stillness.\nFormless, it encompasses all manifestations;\nemptiness and stillness, it embraces all movement and growth—\nthus it is called the hidden essence of all things.\n\nThe virtuous ruler, upright in essence,\ncan value truth.\nThe unworthy and foolish, following perversity,\ndespise the *Dao*—\nthus, some treasure it, others do not.\n\nFine words can earn respect,\nactions can elevate others.\nYet one who embodies the *Dao* forgets words;\ntruthful speech is not merely beautiful.\nElaborate arguments to justify falsehood\ncannot truly grasp truth.\nEmpty words, devoid of substance,\nhow can they be called the *Dao*?\nFlowery speech confuses the people,\ndecorating falsehood as truth.\nFrivolous theories disrupt the people,\nturning vice into virtue.\nSuch words may serve in marketplace transactions—\nhow can they convey *virtue/power* or embrace the *Dao*?\n\nThose who attain supreme *virtue/power*\nforget distinctions of self and other.\nThose who awaken to nature\nmerge into harmonious unity.\nHow can one exalt oneself while belittling others,\naffirm oneself while negating others,\nand place oneself above all things?\n\nThe unvirtuous—\nwhy abandon them?\nThe sage’s teachings are established\nto enlighten the ignorant;\nthe wondrous *Dao* spreads far,\nperfecting those yet unaware.\nTo make the unvirtuous virtuous,\nto make the ignorant wise—\nconstantly saving people,\nnever abandoning any.\nThus, the Son of Heaven is established,\nand the Three Ministers are appointed.\n\nIn the most ancient times, the pure and simple,\nthe wise and foolish were equal.\nTheir bodies did not stray from the *Dao*,\ntheir conduct aligned with nature—\nall treasured the *Dao*.\n\nFrom the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors onward,\nthings grew corrupt and muddled.\nWithout a ruler, people could not be guided;\nwith a sovereign, things could be transformed.\nThus, above, the *scholarly-officials* were appointed to assist the *hands-off ruler*,\nbelow, officials were set to discuss the *Dao*.\nThey were shown what was good and evil,\nadmonished with rites,\ntransforming the unvirtuous,\ncultivating pure winds.\n\nEven with jade discs and swift horses as tribute,\nit is not as good as advancing this *Dao*.\nIn ancient times, the *scholarly-officials* first presented jade,\nthen horses—\nthus, “with jade discs before swift horses.”\n\nThose who invert proper order\nmust be awakened from their delusions.\nThose who cling to folly\nshould be illuminated by wisdom’s measure.\nTo be the ruler’s inner counselors,\nthe sovereign’s pillars and arms—\ntheir duty is to rectify evil,\neasily propagating *Dao* and teaching.\n\nYet those who seek fame do not rest in their place,\narbitrarily aiming for improper honors.\nThose who crave favor do not act according to the *Dao*,\nonly seeking high rank.\nArrogance and extravagance bring self-inflicted ruin,\nleading to shared danger and destruction—\nbetter to cultivate the supreme *Dao*,\nremaining unmoved by honor or disgrace.\n\nWhy did the ancients value this *Dao*?\nNot to seek and obtain,\nnor to escape guilt with punishment.\nThus, it is most precious for all under heaven.\n\nFrom ancient times to today,\nwhy is this *Dao* so revered?\nBecause seeking it is not accomplished in a day,\npracticing it averts a hundred years of calamity,\nsecures blessings and fortune,\nand severs danger and ruin.\nThus, it is honored by all ages,\nvalued by both heaven and humankind.\n\nTo act without action,\nto manage without managing,\nto savor without savoring—\nto still restless movement,\nto concentrate the mind in tranquility.\nTo abandon excessive affairs,\nto empty oneself in naturalness.\nTo discard desires,\nto indulge in the mysterious and subtle.\n\nGreat and small, much and little—\nto repay resentment with *virtue/power*.\nResentment arises, sometimes great, sometimes small.\nEnmity emerges, sometimes few, sometimes many.\nOnce entangled in affairs,\none is bound by these ties,\nand resentment begets resentment without end.\nIf one returns to the great *Dao* of *wuwei*,\npreserves the burdenless naturalness,\nabandons this muddled world,\nand savors this pure emptiness—\nthen faults do not arise,\nresentment and enmity do not take root—\nthis is repaying resentment with *virtue/power*.\n\nDifficult arises from easy,\ngreat from small.\nThe world’s difficult matters\nmust begin with what is easy;\ngreat affairs must arise from what is small.\n*Arise* means *initiate*.\nAffairs begin with what is easy to achieve,\nthen grow difficult.\nThings in their growth\nalso proceed from small to great.\nTo remove great crimes,\none must first extinguish what is

many difficulties.\nFirm speech must be kept—\nlight promises are empty.\nDifficulties arise from committing evil deeds,\nlife and death become easy to manage.\nUnlawful acts\nare difficult from beginning to end.\nThus, even the sage finds them difficult—\nand so they never arise.\n\nLightly undertaking evil deeds,\none steps into the causes of guilt.\nThe sage, wise and insightful,\nstill

hardship;\nto dwell before others without virtue brings danger—\nthus it is said: you are dead.\n\nKindness, when used in battle, conquers;\nwhen used in defense, it is steadfast.\nHeaven, about to save it, guards it with kindness.\nUsing kindness as principle,\nit does not lose its Dao.\n\nIn battle, it must overcome the enemy—\nthus it conquers.\nIn defense, it faces no collapse or peril—\nthus it is steadfast.\nWith kindness as heart,\nthe Mysterious Heaven protects it—\nthus it is said: Heaven saves it.\nThe utmost Dao preserves it—\nthus it is said: the Dao guards

within my own land I strike first, I am the host;\nwhen in the battlefield I move first, I am the host.\n\nTo strike first and move first is arrogance and excess—\na perilous state.\nNow I seek to preserve my whole,\nthus it is said: I dare to be the host.\n\nIn harmony yet not singing, following yet not leading—\nthus it is said: to be the guest.\n\nI do not dare advance an inch only to retreat a foot.\nI do not rely on military might to invade externally—\nthus it is said: I do not advance an inch.\nYet I rely on **accumulating virtue** to defend internally—\nthus it is said: I retreat a foot.\n\nThis is called **action without action**—\nforces arise from the other.\nI truly do not act,\nyet respond to things and act without effort,\nmoving without intent—\n**action without action**.\n\n**Repelling without arms**—\nanger drives the use of forces,\nand this is why one repels with arms.\nAs the guest, I retreat a foot,\nnot relying on arms to repel—\nthus it is said: **repelling without arms**.\n\n**Holding without forces**—\nharming the other without **Dao/Way**,\nthis is why one holds forces.\nForces are used to still forces,\npunishment is meted out to end punishment.\nNot yet losing **benevolence and righteousness**,\nthose who revere the Dao return of their own accord—\nthere are no forces to hold.\n\nNo greater calamity than **insulting the enemy**—\ninsulting the enemy nearly brings about the loss of my treasure.\n\nTo **kill without cause** is not to be done habitually,\nthough in times of conflict, the Dao values **mystery and stillness**,\nthus it is said: **govern things through non-action**,\nstrive to **settle the people**,\nand do not let harm arise.\nIf one retreats and loses the **Dao of non-action**#27,\nor advances without **stillness and subduing forces**#28,\nand **lightly insults the enemy**,\nthe state will collapse and the people perish—\na calamity most dire.\n\nA state with **abundant people and wealth**,\na **sage ruler and virtuous ministers**—\nthis is called **possessing the treasure**.\n\nWhen the people perish and the granaries are empty,\nwhen ministers are humiliated and the ruler is in peril—\nthis is near to losing my treasure.\nThus, when opposing forces are equal,\nthe **compassionate will prevail**.\n\nOpposing forces are equal when both sides mobilize their troops,\ntheir numbers and strength balanced—\nthus it is said: **equal opposing forces**.\nTo **lightly scorn the enemy** with no preparation,\nand to **covet victory yet love killing**—\nthis is inferior.\n\n**Stillness** must align with the **Dao/Way**,\n**action** must follow strict laws,\nnever losing **benevolence**—\nfor **benevolence** can govern things,\nand thus the **compassionate will prevail**.\n\nWithin, one knows **disturbances and afflictions** are manifold,\nand they cannot be broken without **wisdom**.\nTo expound their methods,\nthus it is said: **When employing forces, there are words to heed**.\n\nTo be the host must be **heroic and strong**,\nto be the guest must be **yielding and weak**.\nThose who would **still movement and return to stillness**,\nknowing to **guard strength with yielding**—\nthus it is said: **I do not dare to be the host but instead the guest**.\n\nIf one **ignores the Dao/Way** and **obscures it**,\nadvancing the **Dao/Way** is like retreating—\n**learning without true learning**,\n**practicing without true practice**—\nthus it is said: **I do not dare advance an inch only to retreat a foot**.\n\nUnderstanding that **all conditions are illusory**,\nrealizing that **both principles and teachings are empty**—\n**action without action**.\n\nNot only are all ten thousand phenomena **empty and tranquil**,\nbut also the self is **empty and pure**—\n**repelling without arms**.\n\nWithin, one **forgets wisdom**,\n**holding without forces**.\n\nExternally, one **severs emotional attachments**,\nand thus has **no enemies**.\n\n**Indulging emotions and extreme desires**,\nlosing the **Dao/Way** and ruining the self—\nthis is the loss of my treasure#29.\n\n**Wisdom** and **disturbances**,\nthese two kinds always

free of burdens**—\nthus the **compassionate will prevail**.\n\n**Chapter 70: My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice.**\nThe **sage** establishes teachings,\n**concise in words yet profound in meaning**,\nilluminating **principles and revealing their significance**—\nthus they are easy to know.\n**Embrace the One**#30, **free from myriad entanglements**,\n**non-action** **severing burdens**—\nthus they are easy to practice.\n\nYet none under Heaven can know them,\nnone can practice them.\n**Common emotions** do not conform to **mysterious teachings**,\n**cling to folly** and have not yet opened to **wisdom**,\nnot recognizing this **Dao/Way**—\nthus none can know them.\n**Lost in desires**, they do not **habitually practice non-action**,\nabandoning **rightness** to follow **evil**—\nthus none can practice them.\n\nWords have a **root**,\naffairs have a **master**.\n**Root** is **foundation**,\n**master** is **ruler**.\nTo take **virtue and

      "translated_text": "「Chapter 76: Human life begins in softness and weakness,\nyet death manifests in rigidity and strength.\nUnder heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than **qi**,\nand nothing is softer and weaker than the **Dao/Way**.\nThus, when a person is born,\nthey must draw upon the **Dao/Way** and **qi**.\nWhen **qi** remains, bending and straightening are at one’s own command;\nwhen the **Dao/Way** is present, movement and stillness are governed by **spirit** (*shén*).\n\nThe heart follows without resistance,\nactions proceed without hindrance,\nhence the saying of softness and weakness.\nIf **qi** cannot be preserved,\nits exhaustion brings death to the body;\nif the **spirit** is not yet liberated,\nits departure means life’s end.\nWhen life’s end comes and the body perishes,\nthere is no further movement—\nhence it is called rigidity and strength.\n\nAll things, grasses and trees,\nbegin life as tender and fragile,\nyet in death become withered and brittle.\nSentientless beings—\nthose with **qi** live, those without **qi** die.\nThus, it is known that among beings with awareness,\nthose who grasp the **Dao/Way** belong to the category of softness and weakness,\nwhile those who lose the **Dao/Way** fall into rigidity and strength.\n\nTherefore, rigidity and strength are the followers of death,\nwhile softness and weakness are the followers of life.\nBinding the above with sentient and sentientless beings,\nthe two principles of birth and death,\neach has its own category of adherents.\n\nHence, armies grow strong yet cannot conquer,\ntrees grow strong yet are felled.\nNot relying on **virtue/power** but on arms to be strong—\nthis is violent to all under heaven who love life,\nyet hated by all things.\nGathering few to make many,\nsupporting weak to make strong,\nand then attacking together—\nthere will be those who cannot conquer.\n\nThus, when a tree grows strong,\nits branches and leaves flourish above;\nwhen a pillar grows strong,\nits beams and supports are steadied below.\nBy this analogy, I explain:\nto seek **virtue/power** in softness and weakness,\nnot to adorn oneself with arms for rigidity and strength.\nSo, rigidity and strength reside beneath,\nwhile softness and weakness dwell above.\n\nLife is what all rejoice in;\nsoftness and weakness are the followers of life—\nis this not the highest?\nDeath is what all grieve over;\nrigidity and strength are the followers of death—\nis this not the lowest?\n\nChapter 77: The **Dao/Way** of heaven\nis like a drawn bow.\nHuman affairs are near and shallow,\nfaced yet their true nature remains unseen;\nthe **Dao/Way** of heaven is distant and profound,\ngazed upon yet its principle cannot be fully comprehended.\nThe confused cannot know it,\nthe correct **Dao/Way** is difficult to discern—\nthus, I borrow the analogy of the drawn bow.\n\nThe high are lowered,\nthe low are raised,\nthe excessive are diminished,\nthe insufficient are supplemented.\nThe **Dao/Way** of using a bow:\nthe high fear overshooting,\nso they are lowered lest they be too high.\nThe low fear falling short,\nso they are raised lest they be too low.\nNeither too high nor too low,\nthis is the middle—what is expected.\n\nFor those who govern a state,\nthey diminish the excess of wealth,\nsupplement the lack of poverty.\nThe poor, though benefited, remain poor,\nthe rich, though diminished, remain rich.\nNeither poor nor rich,\nthis is the middle in the governance of a state.\n\nToo high risks the emptiness of the void,\nso it is lowered lest it be void.\nToo low risks stagnation in deficiency,\nso it is raised lest it be deficient.\nNeither deficient nor void,\nthis aligns with the middle **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of heaven\ndiminishes the excessive and supplements the insufficient.\nI explain the **Dao/Way** of heaven through this analogy.\nBut human affairs are not so:\nthey diminish the insufficient to serve the excessive.\nThis is to say that human actions contradict the **Dao/Way** of heaven,\nand cannot diminish the strong to benefit the weak,\nnor reduce the rich to augment the poor.\nWho can have excess to serve all under heaven?\nOnly those who grasp the **Dao/Way**.\n\nWho can follow the **Dao/Way** of heaven in their conduct,\ndiminishing the full to supplement the humble?\nOnly the **Dao/Way**-aligned ruler can know this.\n\nThus, the sage acts yet does not rely on it,\nachieves yet does not possess—\nthis is not to value the worthy.\nThe sage cultivates **virtue/power** without expecting its rewards,\ncompletes things without claiming its merits.\nThis is so because they wish to conceal their sage **virtue/power**,\nand obscure their worthy talents.\nSince the highest act thus,\nthe lowest naturally follow.\nThe calamity of seeking fame is removed,\nthe pity of valuing the worthy does not arise.\n\nChapter 78: Under heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than water,\nyet nothing can surpass it in overcoming rigidity and strength—\nit cannot be replaced.\nObserving all things,\nsummarizing all existence,\nthe utmost softness and weakness\nis water above all else.\nIt melts metal and stone,\nerodes hills and mounds—\nnothing can surpass water,\nwater is the most victorious.\n\nTo overcome rigidity and strength, one must imitate water.\nSince it is victorious,\nit cannot be replaced.\nFor those who govern a state,\nif they can take humility as **virtue/power**,\nand the **Dao/Way** as their method,\nthey can overcome strong enemies,\nsubdue the mighty—\nand the **Dao/Way** will be the foremost,\nthus nothing can replace it.\n\nFor those who cultivate themselves,\nif they can uphold the utmost **Dao/Way** of softness,\nthey will naturally break the rigidity and strength of self and others,\nand grasp the utmost principle of **emptiness** and **purity**.\nThey will transcend the disputes of right and wrong.\nOnly the **Dao/Way** is victorious,\nnothing can substitute for it.\n\nThus, softness overcomes rigidity,\nweakness overcomes strength—\nthis concludes the previous discussion.\n\nUnder heaven, none can know it,\nnone can practice it.\nMany love rigidity and strength,\nfew preserve softness and weakness,\nunable to humble themselves,\nstriving to be first among all things.\n\nTherefore, the sage says:\nTo bear the state’s filth,\nthis is called the master of soil and grain;\nTo bear the state’s misfortunes,\nthis is the ruler of all under heaven.\nCorrect words, yet reversed in meaning.\nEmbodying the **Dao/Way** of softness and weakness,\nthen all things are contained within.\nUnderstanding the realm of the profound and mysterious,\nthen all affairs are naturally received.\nSuppressing wrongdoing without stifling virtue,\nbearing the state’s filth—\nblaming oneself and taking responsibility,\nbearing the state’s misfortunes—\nthis is fitting for being the master of all things,\nhence the saying: the ruler of all under heaven.\n\nThis is contrary to common practice yet in accord with the **Dao/Way**,\nthus it is said: correct words, yet reversed in meaning.\nFilth (*nòu*) is impurity.\nMisfortune (*xiáng*) is virtue.\n\nFor those who cultivate themselves,\nthough they experience impurity and purity,\nthey forget both purity and impurity.\nThough they traverse virtue and vice,\nthey harbor both vice and virtue equally.\nIlluminating the original **emptiness** of a single principle,\nrealizing that all realms are empty—\nthis can achieve the **Dao/Way**,\nand become the **Dharma King** (*Fǎwáng*).\n\nCommon practice regards filth, purity, virtue, and vice\nas all having existence,\nbut observing through the **Dao/Way**,\nall are seen as **emptiness**—\nhence it is said: reversed.\n\nChapter 79: Reconciling great grudges\nwill inevitably leave lingering grudges—\nhow can this be considered good?\nWhen self and others are equal and unified,\nright and wrong do not arise.\nWhen distinctions and conflicts abound,\ngrudges and enmities naturally flourish.\nThus, ritual has the principle of repaying grudges,\nlaw has the penalty of death for retribution.\nGrudges

carriages and boats exist, they are not used.\nFor what need is there of boats on water?\nOr carriages on land?\nIn the age of **non-action**, mountains lack paths or tunnels,\nmarshes lack bridges or ferries.\nThe source cuts off coming and going—\nwhat need is there for riding?\n\nThough armor and weapons exist, they are not deployed.\nWeapons are used to punish rebels,\nmartial might to quell chaos.\nWhen the ruler follows the **Dao/Way**, the people cherish **virtue/power**.\nTransformation follows naturally—\nwhat need is there for arraying troops?\n\nLet the people return to using knotted cords for records.\nIn ancient times, before writing was invented,\nknots on cords were used for governance.\nOnce writing arose, frivolity increased,\nand though sages taught, the principle remained **non-action**.\nThey wished to return to simplicity, discard ornamentation,\nand embrace reality.\nLet their food be plain, their clothing simple,\ntheir dwellings secure, their customs joyful.\nWhen hearts are content, coarse food and rough garments suffice as delight.\nNow the Sage’s transformation surpasses the Great Pivot—\nno distinction between noble and common,\nall food is savory,\nall clothing beautiful,\nall dwellings secure,\nall homes filled with joy.\nNo one flees far—\nthe weak and the dying are naturally cut off.\nNeighboring states are visible to the eye,\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs heard in ears,\nyet from beginning to end,\nfrom youth to old age,\nthey do not visit one another.\nTwo states as neighbors,\nvisible to the eye,\nroosters crowing, dogs barking—\nyet from start to finish,\nfrom young to old,\nthey do not come and go,\neach self-sufficient, each home complete.\nThus it is said:\nPeople forget each other in the **Dao/Way**,\nfish forget each other in rivers and lakes—\nthis is what is meant.\n\n**Chapter 81:**\nTruthful speech is not ornate,\nornate speech is not truthful.\nSpeech reveals the heart—\nnot for idle fabrication,\nbut to uphold true principle,\nnot for empty words.\nThus, truthful speech is not ornate.\nSweet words betray truth,\nlight promises lack sincerity—\nthus, ornate speech is not truthful.\n\nThe good do not argue,\narguers are not good.\nGreat eloquence seems stammering,\nwithout labored words.\nThe good do not argue.\nOne-sided speech overreaches,\nmany words lead to exhaustion—\narguers are not good.\n\nThe wise are not learned,\nthe learned are not wise.\nIf you know one thing,\nall things are complete—\nthe wise are not learned.\nWhen form overshadows substance,\nlearning drowns the mind,\ntrue principle is forgotten.\n\nThe sun and moon shine their light,\nilluminating all peaks,\nthings gain sight and their brilliance increases—\njust as the Sage’s wisdom penetrates all things,\nand their teachings extend endlessly.\nRivers and seas nourish all things,\ngiving life while their source never runs dry—\njust as the Sage’s generosity is inexhaustible.\n\nThe **Dao/Way of Heaven** benefits without harming,\nthe **Dao/Way of the Sage** acts without contention.\nHeaven’s **Dao/Way** bestows life—\nthis is benefit.\nIt always rescues people without harm.\nContention arises from the heart,\naction from circumstances.\nThe Sage has no heart—\nthus naturally no action.\nWhen action is none,\n**non-action** is also none.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is ever **non-action** yet nothing remains undone.\nThe **Ultimate Dao/Way** is profound and still,\ntrue reality unmoved—\nthis is **non-action**.\nYet it responds to things and moves,\nits transformation reaching everywhere,\nadapting to all forms—\nhow could it lack anything?\nThrough myriad expedients, it does all things.\n**Non-action** yet doing—\nstillness is not always still,\naction is not always active.\nWhen action is not always active,\nrest returns to stillness;\nwhen stillness is not always still,\nmovement arises from stillness.\nStillness is itself movement—\nit does not remain in stillness;\nmovement returns to stillness—\nit does not remain in movement.\n**Ultimate truth** speaks:\nTransformation is not stillness.\nAll beings can move and can be still—\nknow that movement and non-movement\nare neither movement nor non-movement.\nProclaim this **non-doing** as neither doing nor not-doing.\n\nIf kings could uphold it,\nall things would naturally align.\n**Virtue/power** subdues all things,\nthe **Dao/Way** is present—thus they are honored.\nKings who uphold the **Dao/Way** do not command alignment,\ndukes who cherish **virtue/power** do not enforce transformation.\nYet if transformation falters and action arises,\nI shall suppress it with the **uncarved block of the Nameless**.\n\n*\"Action\"* means to stir—\nthose who cannot follow transformation\ndesire to stir the heart toward **action**.\nWith the **uncarved block of the Nameless**, suppress it—\nthe heart of **action** will naturally cease.\nPreserve the **Dao/Way**, nurture simplicity,\nembrace the uncarved, hold to purity.\nThe **uncarved block of the Nameless**—\nit too will not desire.\nIts principle is empty yet substantial,\nits essence neither true nor false,\nneither mundane nor abandoned.\nOnly the stirring of desire is the ailment—\nthe Sage uses the **uncarved block of the Nameless** as the remedy.\nThe remedy removes the ailment;\nwhen the ailment is gone, the remedy is forgotten.\nThus, the **uncarved block of the Nameless**—\nit too will not desire.\nOr rather, the **uncarved block** with a name—\nhow could it not desire?\nWith no desire, all is still—\nthe world naturally aligns.\nUsing wisdom to govern is a state’s ruin,\n**action** disrupts things, which are ever in motion.\nIf the ruler can hold to stillness and **non-desire**,\nthe people need no ordering and will align themselves,\nall nations require no commands and will correct themselves.\nIf inner clarity abandons these burdens,\nreturning to the Nameless—\nif desire still arises,\nthen peace is lost, and the **Dao/Way** is forsaken.\nNow, neither the burdens to abandon nor the Nameless to grasp are seen—\nwhen taking and discarding are forgotten,\ndesire does not arise.",

after reassembly, the tail remains intact, while the head still shows slight lacunae.\nThe missing portion includes commentary on *Dao De Jing* Chapter 38 and partial verses from Chapter 39, supplemented by the *Dao De Jing’s Mysterious Virtue* (Qiande Zanshu) attributed to Liang Siqi (hereafter referred to as the Liang text).\n\nThe Dunhuang manuscripts do not divide chapters, and commentary runs continuously in small double-column characters.\nThe present edition has been altered accordingly. #2\nThis chapter’s commentary is supplemented by the Liang text.\n\n#3 The Dunhuang text begins at the character **\"地\"** beneath.\n#4 **\"石\"**: This character was originally omitted;
