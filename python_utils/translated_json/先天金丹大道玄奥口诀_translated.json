  "full_translation": "**The Esoteric Oral Instructions on the Primordial Golden Elixir Dao**\n*Title:* *Esoteric Oral Instructions on the Primordial Golden Elixir Dao*\nBy Huo Jizhi, composed during the Southern Song. One fascicle.\n*Source text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Zhongjie* Category.\n\n**Preface to the Esoteric Oral Instructions on the Primordial Golden Elixir Dao**\n\nIn my youth, I studied the elixir classics and, where they cited phenomena to expound principles, glimpsed a thing or two. Yet with a family to tend and official duties to fulfill, though I cherished recitation, I had no leisure to practice. At twenty-eight, entangled in frontier affairs, I was demoted and exiled to Chunling. Passing through Yueyang, a guest showed me Master Huiweng’s lines on Mount Beiluo—*\"A thousand valleys, deep with cloud and qi; ten thousand deaths, yet the soul sprouts wings\"*—which moved me to sigh: *\"Heaven and Earth cycle endlessly; why alone can I not, like the lotus, loosen my bonds a year sooner to know my errors?\"* At once, I dismissed my servants and concubines, and worldly dust vanished in an instant.\n\nOne day, I met a woodcutter-recluse who spoke of the elixir’s essentials at the Elegant Chant Pavilion. His words were not abstruse but clear and easily grasped. Yet I, taking them as too simple, grew careless and left before he finished. Arriving at Mount Jiuyi, friends and I built thatched huts to explore the mountains. Between lessons, I began to focus on self-cultivation, aiding it with stillness. The firing times, tally symbols, and hexagram sequences of elixir studies all aligned with the instructions. In that tranquil state, my body too gained insight. Recalling the recluse’s teachings, I was about to amend my ways when an imperial decree summoned me north to my homeland of Liaoyang. Those who saw me marveled at my frost-white beard turning black again, confirming the marvel of elixir studies. Though my hair and temples remained as before, they were enough to cherish—how much more so if I had received the true transmission and practiced it!\n\nShortly after, I was graced with imperial favor and appointed to the staff of Jiangzhen’s military headquarters. Riding alone to my post, I found official duties mountainous. Yet whenever I dwelled there, I delighted in the *Laozi* and *Book of Changes*, ever regretting the lack of like-minded companions. Suddenly, Master Huo of Piling arrived, bearing elixir instructions in his sleeve. Reading them, I found they matched what I had heard in Yueyang. He broadly took the true medicine, Earth of Kun, and firing times as the three essentials of elixir arts, their source flowing from the *Wuzhen Pian*, yet their guiding principles no different from Zhou Dunyi’s *Taiji Diagram*. Moreover, he detested how世人借容成之秽论以传《悟真》，迎合士大夫之欲，而诬紫阳之道。Alas!\n\nHad Master Huo arrived a decade earlier, I might have studied the *Cantong Qi* and advanced in this Dao during my leisurely days at Jiuyi. Now, Master Huo presents his instructions, seeking a preface.\n\nAlas! The watery *po* and fiery *hun*, the sacred scripture of the Great Ultimate—on the days of *wu* and *ji*, the true Earth assumes its rightful place. Qian and Kun are my crucible, Kan and Li my elixir materials, *Fu* and *Gou* my firing times. Within the yellow center, the principle is thoroughly penetrated; when the supreme Dao congeals, the murky *qi* and turbid substance are transformed without remainder, filling and radiating brilliance, the sagely work perfected!\n\nTo seek the Limitless in the postcelestial, to demand the rightful position from another’s body—without reflecting on the difficulty of transforming one’s own *qi* and substance, one instead clings to the most benighted and impure of yin’s biases, nurturing delusion! How narrowly they avoid the ghostly marketplace.\n\nMy worldly thoughts have long since turned to ash; I know not the taste of wealth or rank. Weary of official dust, I shall soon abandon it to build a hut beneath the Five Elders, a single ravine veiled in clouds. When Master Huo passes by in the future, we shall guide and admonish each other, clarifying the verifications of the *Wuzhen* learning. Then the *Taiji Diagram* of Master Zhou, the *night qi* of Mencius, and the *Qian* dragon of the *Taiyi* will be transmitted together, undecayed. Though your life may be one of hardship, it shall be one of attainment, and I too shall escape the censure of those who \"seek the hidden and practice the strange.\"\n\nThus I write this preface as a parting gift.\n\nOn an auspicious day of the *li-xia* solar term in the *xinhai* year of the Chunyou reign, Liu Zicheng Qingshu of Yuyuan writes this preface.\n\nQu Yuan’s *Far Roaming* and Master Zhu Xi’s reading of the *Cantong Qi*—their stirred, grieving, and indignant hearts were one. Yet the art of the golden elixir, rooted in the *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* and expounded by Wei Boyang, is no falsehood! In recent times, those who toy with its words and write books to clarify its learning fill libraries to overflowing, yet those who grasp its truth are scarcely one or two. Though innate capacity cannot be forced, this is also due to the loss of transmission of the ancient learning.\n\nFrom youth I longed for this Way, and in old age I have gained some understanding—yet the years have passed, and can it no longer be transmitted? My fellow townsman, Master Huo, showed me this book, though it contains many omissions and leaks. Compared to the works of others, it is by no means inferior. Delighted, I have inscribed these words for it, and also recounted how Qu Yuan and Master Zhu Xi read the *Cantong Qi*, to awaken later learners.\n\nOn the first day of the fourth month of early summer in the *jiyou* year of the Chunyou reign, You Qing of Jinling respectfully writes.\n\n**The Profound Oral Instructions on the Great Dao of the Primordial Golden Elixir**\n*Recorded by Huo Jizhi of Jinling*\n\nThe Great Dao arises from the Primordial, spontaneous and self-so. From Non-Ultimate to Supreme Ultimate, the Dao lies hidden in formlessness; from Supreme Ultimate to Heaven and Earth, the Dao manifests in embodied form. Thus, from yin and yang arise the Five Phases, and from the Five Phases is conceived the One Nature. When the One Nature is discerned, the One Creation is perceived; when the One Form is established, the One Qian and Kun are known. Then one realizes that in the human body, the ebb and flow of spirit, the waxing and waning of qi and blood—none differs from the yin-yang transformations of Heaven and Earth.\n\nYet within the body, there is the Primordial and the Posterior. What is the Primordial? It is the true within the true, the innate endowment of the square-inch [heart]. Its body is mysterious and empty—likened to lead and mercury, entrusted to metal and wood, named dragon and tiger. Generally, it is called the Two Things; comprehensively, the Four Images. These are the pure qi of the Five Phases, belonging to the Primordial of the body.\n\nWhat is the Posterior? It is the Five Viscera—lumps of unilluminated substance sustaining the leaky body. Cultivated, they may only ward off illness and prolong life; relied upon, they cannot transcend the womb or transform the spirit. These are the turbid forms of the Five Phases, belonging to the Posterior of the body.\n\nThe Primordial Dao is profound and hard to know; the Posterior is shallow and easy to see. Some take the Nature School’s seated meditation for the Primordial, requiring no effort, unaware of creation’s workings. Yet their vacant stillness belongs to the yin of Chan, not the yang-spirit of immortality. If the Nature School were the Great Dao, why would the ancient sages speak of the golden elixir? Why speak of divine immortals? They might as well say that cultivating Nature suffices! Little do they know that the Primordial Dao is near, clear, and easy to cultivate—yet the world’s people, benighted, do not recognize what in themselves is the Primordial, what is lead and mercury, what is dragon and tiger.\n\nIf the Nature School were the elixir, why not speak of One Thing instead of Two? Why speak of Four Images? Without encountering a divine immortal’s transmission, one can only speculate in vain. As [Master] Pingshu said: *\"Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without a true teacher, do not force guesses.\"*\n\nOthers abandon the Primordial to study the Posterior, taking the *Huangting*’s Five Viscera as primary, the body’s qi and blood as essential. They merely practice inner contemplation, swallowing saliva and absorbing qi—deeming this sufficient for immortality! Yet the Posterior’s Five Phases cannot soar or transform; they are mere dregs of form, not the One Qi of the formless void. As Master Zhongli’s poem says: *\"Heart and kidney are not water and fire; how can kan and li become mercury and lead?\"* The embodied Five Phases can only prolong life and ward off illness; they cannot ascend to truth. The Primordial Five Phases, like the water and fire of sun and moon, have form but no substance—thus they soar and transform, enabling immortality. Let scholars truly awaken to this!\n\nThe Primordial Golden Elixir: from before our birth, this thing already exists within us. One thing divides into two, separated as east and west—this is lead and mercury, also called metal and wood. As metal and water share a palace, fire and wood share a position, they are called the Four Images. Without *wu* and *ji* to harmonize and unite them, they cannot return to the center. The key lies in discerning the Heaven-Earth mechanism of movement and stillness, exploring the sun-moon mysteries of waxing and waning. At this time, observe Heaven’s Dao, grasp Heaven’s workings—this is all.\n\nYet *wu* and *ji* do not abide between Heaven and Earth; one must recognize when Heaven and Earth possess *wu* and *ji* before advancing in practice—this is the firing times. Some say the spleen is earth—why speak of no earth? Know that the spleen belongs to the Posterior, the earth of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—not *wu* and *ji*. As Pingshu said: *\"Only by thoroughly understanding yin-yang and penetrating creation’s workings can one pursue the Two Qi along the Yellow Path, merge the Three Natures in the Primordial Palace, bore through the Five Phases, and harmonize the Four Images.\"*\n\nI, born in Piling, received transmission from my late father, the Lord of Shanggu Prefecture, who once encountered a sage’s instruction. Having obtained this lineage, I do not fear leaks and omissions. I have carefully recorded the Primordial lead, mercury, and firing times in the accompanying diagram, to transmit to later learners. Should a gentleman of immortal bone and countenance chance upon me—one whose karmic affinity aligns, who sees through fame and profit as bubbles and illusions, who laments life and death as a wind-lantern—if he wishes to hear the essentials of the Great Dao, I will conceal nothing.\n\nThis is the root of plants and trees. Relying on ordinary soil for nourishment, the root remains alive; without the root, it withers. The human root originally has form, yet the root has already scattered. Without the true earth of *wu* and *ji* to nourish it, it cannot return to its root—this is *fu* [return]. Scattered, it returns; thus Laozi said: *\"Returning to the root is called stillness; this is called recovering destiny.\"*\n\nThe human root is like plants and trees, growing upside-down. As Pingshu said: *\"Without recognizing the upside-down within the mysterious, how can one know how to plant lotuses in fire?\"* The scripture says: *\"Qi returns to its original root; the luminous soul follows its fundamental root; the flying root scatters the mysterious leaves.\"*\n\n**Diagram of the Golden Elixir’s Medicinal Substances: Direct Pointers**\n\nMaster Pingshu said: lead and mercury are the two medicinal substances. He also said: *\"When these two things meet, nature and emotion unite.\"* Daoguang said: *\"One thing divides into two.\"* Yunfang said: *\"Apart from lead and mercury, the two medicinal ingredients, all else is deception to delude the foolish.\"*\n\nThese two substances do not reside in the five viscera, nor are they essence or blood, nor are they fluids. They do not rely on visualization, nor are they dhyāna meditation, nor sitting in emptiness, nor the arts of the bedchamber. Lead and mercury—these two substances—are not sought outside the body; one must seek them within one’s own body. Heaven and earth possess these two substances and endure; the human body also relies on them in daily use. Thus the *Yijing* says: *\"The hundred clans use them daily yet do not know.\"* How rare are those who grasp the Dao of the solitary sovereign!\n\nMaster Pingshu said: *\"If li and kan lack wu and ji, though the four images unite, the elixir will not form.\"* He also said: *\"The four images and five phases all depend on earth.\"* And again: *\"It is originally through wu and ji that they are wed.\"*\n\n**Direct Oral Instructions:**\nOne sees the heavenly stems and earthly branches but not wu and ji, yet wu and ji reside within heaven and earth. The same holds true within the human body. When heaven and earth have their time of wu and ji, so too does one’s own body. This is what is meant by *\"gazing up at heaven and looking down at oneself\"*—it is called stealing heaven and earth’s complete qi of wu and ji to supplement the insufficiency of wu and ji in one’s own body. The *Yinfu Jing* says: *\"Heaven has five thieves; those who see them prosper.\"* Thus it is said: *\"The myriad things steal from heaven; humans steal from the myriad things.\"*\n\nEarth’s alternate name is the cinnabar field. The cinnabar field and metal are all earth. Once one recognizes wu and ji, one may proceed with the work—this is called the *fire timing*.\n\n**Fire Timing:**\nFire timing is the five phases within the human body meeting with heaven and earth, the generative qi of returning to the origin gathering and dispersing within the central path. Initially, it does not require laborious circulation, exhalation and inhalation, or artful pretense in practice. All transformations are perfectly complete within a single moment. If one discusses it in terms of the sun and moon’s advance and retreat, there are naturally solar divisions, and one must not force it. If one speaks in terms of days, there is naturally a month’s yin and yang; the same applies to a month or a year.\n\nNow, if one considers the timing of days: one must perceive the mechanism of killing returning to life, the blade and the river chariot, and the door of death transforming into the door of life! Only then, after ten months, the fetal elixir is complete; after a hundred days, the work is accomplished; after twelve years, one ascends in flight—all lies herein!\n\n**Twelve Verses on the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir to Dispel Delusion:**\n\n**Not Chan Buddhism:**\nThe golden elixir entirely depends on receiving the mind-to-mind transmission,\nUnlike the empty gate’s practice of seated meditation.\nThe medicine has its cooking and firing,\nWhen the yang spirit’s qi is sufficient, one becomes an immortal.\n\n**Not Visualization:**\nThe great Dao does not involve visualization or imagination,\nMercury and lead are not black and essence.\nTo know the priceless treasure of long life,\nThe luminous pearl shines brightly all night.\n\n**Not Ritual Practice:**\nBurning incense, clicking teeth, and visualizing spirits,\nGrasping mudras, writing talismans, and summoning the myriad spirits—\nSuch efforts are not the supreme Dao,\nFor within the true, there is yet the primordial true.\n\n**Not the Five Viscera:**\nMercury and lead are the forms of kan and li,\nThe marvelous maiden and infant, tiger and dragon.\nThey are not the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, or kidneys,\nThe true origin lies separately in the crystal palace.\n\n**Not Bedchamber Arts:**\nCultivating the elixir entirely depends on cutting off lust and delusion,\nSpeaking of the bedchamber is foolishness.\nThe Supreme Lord’s immortals are of the pure and still,\nHow could the filthy and turbid establish the foundation of the elixir?\n\n**Seeking the Root:**\nEver since the Supreme Ultimate divided into heaven and earth,\nThe ancestral qi and root origin have ceased to exist.\nEven plants and trees can seek their firm root,\nCultivating the true entirely depends on learning to return to the root.\n\n**Recognizing the Medicinal Substances:**\nEast Flower gazes toward White Tortoise Terrace,\nThe golden tower looms majestically before it.\nThen one sees the true person ascending to the jade palace,\nIn stillness, hearing the thunderous roar.\n\n**Knowing the True Earth:**\nYin and yang copulate and cook themselves,\nWithout aligning with the center, the marvel is incomplete.\nWhen did heaven and earth ever have wu and ji?\nSeek the true earth in the mind-to-mind transmission.\n\n**Awakening to Fire Timing:**\nThe mechanism of fire timing’s advance and retreat,\nThe subtle workings of waxing and waning—ponder them deeply.\nDo you yet know the three refrains of the jade zither?\nThe divine light of the precious tripod gently soars.\n\n**Viewing the Elixir Chamber:**\nThe valley spirit’s mysterious female is the elixir chamber,\nThis is the formula for long life and immortality.\nWithin it, the numinous embryo’s junction,\nPure yin is entirely stripped away, transforming into pure yang.\n\n**Forming the Immortal Embryo:**\nOnce the embryo is formed, the jade furnace warms,\nQi returns yang and restores the original root.\nSoaring, diving, concealing, and hiding—all are within me,\nFor outside the body, there is another body.\n\n**Diligence from Beginning to End:**\nThe immortals’ marvelous secret is not trivial,\nThough hard to encounter, know that it is easily accomplished.\nThe work of advancing fire must not cease,\nWhen the yang spirit bursts forth, one ascends in flight.\n\n**Postscript:**\nImmortality can be learned; deathlessness can be attained through effort. The ancients spoke thus, and it is no lie!\n\nJuchuan of the world was born in Piling. His great-great-grandfather, the Junior Preceptor Duke Jin, ranked first in the imperial examinations during the reign of Huizong and associated with immortals and alchemists. The family transmitted the *Diagram of the Golden Elixir*, which he showed to Lin Lingsu, saying: *\"This is Chen Tuan’s marvelous secret.\"* Lin Lingsu grasped its essence, but the great-great-grandfather’s path diverged from the Dao, and he listened as if chewing wax, unable to awaken. He then passed it to Guo Sanyi, Grand Marshal of the Bureau of Military Affairs, who was the father of the great-great-grandmother, the Lady of Yue State, née Guo. Guo was fond of the Dao but could not fully investigate its matters, so the diagram remained in the family’s possession.\n\nAfter another ninety years, during the Jiading era, the late father, the Lord of Shanggu Prefecture, suddenly encountered the barefoot Chen the True Person of Mount Wudang, who first transmitted this Dao. Upon returning, he studied the old diagram, and it matched perfectly. He then added oral instructions and annotations, intending to publish it, but the late father passed away.\n\nJuchuan lamented the lack of transmission of the mysterious learning and feared this book’s obscurity. Thus, he made a vow before heaven at the incense altar and commanded craftsmen to carve the woodblocks, continuing his late father’s aspiration.\n\nAlas! All people in the world cling to life and fear death, for such is the nature of the heart. Yet, burdened by their cravings and desires, they cannot steel their resolve or persevere in practice, often halting midway. Thus, we know that hearing the Dao is easy, but walking the Dao is difficult.\n\nFrom childhood, I, Juchuan, delighted in studying the Dao. Since my youth, I practiced quietude, but my late father, fearing I would neglect my scholarly pursuits, repeatedly forbade me. Yet, I could not desist. In my early twenties, extraordinary affairs and worldly gains—fame’s shackles and profit’s snares—occupied my thoughts, and I did not turn to this path.\n\nLater, my late father transmitted his oral instructions to various disciples. Among the noble and eminent of the age, some heard and practiced, some practiced but not diligently, and some delighted in hearing but not in doing. I alone received my late father’s innermost transmission. He admonished me, saying: *\"I attained the Dao of immortals but lacked the fortune of immortals. Now, I am old. My mystical practice has been intermittent, and I have not completed the work. My spiritual dwelling decays, and soon I must depart. I have a debt of gratitude to Jiezhai; you may entrust him with this great matter.\"*\n\nIn the auspicious month of the jia-yin year, I traveled to Shuchuan, where I drank with Jiezhai in joyous abandon. One day, my father suddenly announced his departure. The guests, sensing his intent, sent word to me the next day: *\"The tiger crouches, the dragon descends—no haste in parting. You have a son to entrust; think no more of it.\"*\n\nAh! Had my late father possessed the strength to complete his Dao, how much more would he have achieved! Thus, I record these events after the cinnabar diagram.\n\nWith a hundred bows, I respectfully transcribe the preface by the late Grand Councilor Guo:\n\n*\"Reading the ‘Biography of Zhang Liang’ in the* Han History*, I marveled at how he received the book from the Yellow Stone Elder—was this not extraordinary? With ease and laughter, he aided the rise of a dynasty, surpassing all others. Truly, he had something to rely upon. Yet, the* Biography *states that the book was but a single scroll, the* Art of War of the Grand Duke*. Today, that text circulates in the world, and all may read it. What Zhang Liang received must have been far more than this. I believe its profound essence was kept secret and not transmitted. Later, I observed that Huo Duanda’s family had preserved the book for generations, its origins unknown. Lin Lingsu saw it and deemed it a work transmitted from Chen Tuan’s heart. Huo personally showed it to me—indeed, it was a wondrous book. I sought and obtained it. Later, I presented it to Lin Lingsu, who confirmed its true essence. Once, while crossing the sea to Mount Haishan in Goryeo, I encountered many perils. Yet, after testing it, I found it unfailingly efficacious—a treasure for one’s person! Truly, it should be passed to my descendants. Alas, I could not transmit it widely, so I write this preface as a warning.*\n\n*—Guo Sanyi’s preface, written on the third day of the eleventh month in the first year of Xuanhe (1119).*\n\nThe Prefect of Shanggu, Lord Huo, styled Boyu, was a native of Piling. A descendant of the Grand Preceptor of Jin, he passed the imperial examination with highest honors in the Chongning era. From birth, he was wise and quick-witted, mastering the mysteries of the Nine Schools and the hundred traditions. Unrestrained and magnanimous, he scattered wealth to aid others, rushing to relieve suffering as if it were his own. Once, he encountered a sage who transmitted to him the cinnabar formula and the Dao of corpse-liberation. In the winter of the jia-yin year, without illness, he manifested transformation in the private studio of Zhao Guanwen of Leichuan.\"\n\nHis son Juchuan likewise harbored aspirations beyond the mundane. Though embroiled in the strife of magpie-nest battles and burdened with hollow renown, he regarded official rank as mere dust, returning to the world without vexation, as if resolved to remain thus for life. One day, he published the cinnabar formula as transmitted in his heart, thereby continuing his father’s legacy. I, in turn, was granted a glimpse of the alchemical incense, yet my meager strength precluded inquiry—I could only aspire to study it. Written on the Zhonghe Festival of the ding-si year of Baoyou (1257).\n\n*—Here end the esoteric oral instructions of the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir of Former Heaven.*",

      "translated_text": "From youth I longed for this Way, and in old age I have gained some understanding—yet the years have passed, and can it no longer be transmitted? My fellow townsman, Master Huo, showed me this book, though it contains many omissions and leaks. Compared to the works of others, it is by no means inferior. Delighted, I have inscribed these words for it, and also recounted how Qu Yuan and Master Zhu Xi read the *Cantong Qi*, to awaken later learners.\n\nOn the first day of the fourth month of early summer in the *jiyou* year of the Chunyou reign, You Qing of Jinling respectfully writes.\n\n**The Profound Oral Instructions on the Great Dao of the Primordial Golden Elixir**\n*Recorded by Huo Jizhi of Jinling*\n\nThe Great Dao arises from the Primordial, spontaneous and self-so. From Non-Ultimate to Supreme Ultimate, the Dao lies hidden in formlessness; from Supreme Ultimate to Heaven and Earth, the Dao manifests in embodied form. Thus, from yin and yang arise the Five Phases, and from the Five Phases is conceived the One Nature. When the One Nature is discerned, the One Creation is perceived; when the One Form is established, the One Qian and Kun are known. Then one realizes that in the human body, the ebb and flow of spirit, the waxing and waning of qi and blood—none differs from the yin-yang transformations of Heaven and Earth.\n\nYet within the body, there is the Primordial and the Posterior. What is the Primordial? It is the true within the true, the innate endowment of the square-inch [heart]. Its body is mysterious and empty—likened to lead and mercury, entrusted to metal and wood, named dragon and tiger. Generally, it is called the Two Things; comprehensively, the Four Images. These are the pure qi of the Five Phases, belonging to the Primordial of the body.\n\nWhat is the Posterior? It is the Five Viscera—lumps of unilluminated substance sustaining the leaky body. Cultivated, they may only ward off illness and prolong life; relied upon, they cannot transcend the womb or transform the spirit. These are the turbid forms of the Five Phases, belonging to the Posterior of the body.\n\nThe Primordial Dao is profound and hard to know; the Posterior is shallow and easy to see. Some take the Nature School’s seated meditation for the Primordial, requiring no effort, unaware of creation’s workings. Yet their vacant stillness belongs to the yin of Chan, not the yang-spirit of immortality. If the Nature School were the Great Dao, why would the ancient sages speak of the golden elixir? Why speak of divine immortals? They might as well say that cultivating Nature suffices! Little do they know that the Primordial Dao is near, clear, and easy to cultivate—yet the world’s people, benighted, do not recognize what in themselves is the Primordial, what is lead and mercury, what is dragon and tiger.\n\nIf the Nature School were the elixir, why not speak of One Thing instead of Two? Why speak of Four Images? Without encountering a divine immortal’s transmission, one can only speculate in vain. As [Master] Pingshu said: *\"Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min, without a true teacher, do not force guesses.\"*\n\nOthers abandon the Primordial to study the Posterior, taking the *Huangting*’s Five Viscera as primary, the body’s qi and blood as essential. They merely practice inner contemplation, swallowing saliva and absorbing qi—deeming this sufficient for immortality! Yet the Posterior’s Five Phases cannot soar or transform; they are mere dregs of form, not the One Qi of the formless void. As Master Zhongli’s poem says: *\"Heart and kidney are not water and fire; how can kan and li become mercury and lead?\"* The embodied Five Phases can only prolong life and ward off illness; they cannot ascend to truth. The Primordial Five Phases, like the water and fire of sun and moon, have form but no substance—thus they soar and transform, enabling immortality. Let scholars truly awaken to this!\n\nThe Primordial Golden Elixir: from before our birth, this thing already exists within us. One thing divides into two, separated as east and west—this is lead and mercury, also called metal and wood. As metal and water share a palace, fire and wood share a position, they are called the Four Images. Without *wu* and *ji* to harmonize and unite them, they cannot return to the center. The key lies in discerning the Heaven-Earth mechanism of movement and stillness, exploring the sun-moon mysteries of waxing and waning. At this time, observe Heaven’s Dao, grasp Heaven’s workings—this is all.\n\nYet *wu* and *ji* do not abide between Heaven and Earth; one must recognize when Heaven and Earth possess *wu* and *ji* before advancing in practice—this is the firing times. Some say the spleen is earth—why speak of no earth? Know that the spleen belongs to the Posterior, the earth of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—not *wu* and *ji*. As Pingshu said: *\"Only by thoroughly understanding yin-yang and penetrating creation’s workings can one pursue the Two Qi along the Yellow Path, merge the Three Natures in the Primordial Palace, bore through the Five Phases, and harmonize the Four Images.\"*\n\nI, born in Piling, received transmission from my late father, the Lord of Shanggu Prefecture, who once encountered a sage’s instruction. Having obtained this lineage, I do not fear leaks and omissions. I have carefully recorded the Primordial lead, mercury, and firing times in the accompanying diagram, to transmit to later learners. Should a gentleman of immortal bone and countenance chance upon me—one whose karmic affinity aligns, who sees through fame and profit as bubbles and illusions, who laments life and death as a wind-lantern—if he wishes to hear the essentials of the Great Dao, I will conceal nothing.\n\nThis is the root of plants and trees. Relying on ordinary soil for nourishment, the root remains alive; without the root, it withers. The human root originally has form, yet the root has already scattered. Without the true earth of *wu* and *ji* to nourish it, it cannot return to its root—this is *fu* [return]. Scattered, it returns; thus Laozi said: *\"Returning to the root is called stillness; this is called recovering destiny.\"*\n\nThe human root is like plants and trees, growing upside-down. As Pingshu said: *\"Without recognizing the upside-down within the mysterious, how can one know how to plant lotuses in fire?\"* The scripture says: *\"Qi returns to its original root; the luminous soul follows its fundamental root; the flying root scatters the mysterious leaves.\"*\n\n**Diagram of the Golden Elixir’s Medicinal Substances: Direct Pointers**",

      "translated_text": "Master Pingshu said: lead and mercury are the two medicinal substances. He also said: *\"When these two things meet, nature and emotion unite.\"* Daoguang said: *\"One thing divides into two.\"* Yunfang said: *\"Apart from lead and mercury, the two medicinal ingredients, all else is deception to delude the foolish.\"*\n\nThese two substances do not reside in the five viscera, nor are they essence or blood, nor are they fluids. They do not rely on visualization, nor are they dhyāna meditation, nor sitting in emptiness, nor the arts of the bedchamber. Lead and mercury—these two substances—are not sought outside the body; one must seek them within one’s own body. Heaven and earth possess these two substances and endure; the human body also relies on them in daily use. Thus the *Yijing* says: *\"The hundred clans use them daily yet do not know.\"* How rare are those who grasp the Dao of the solitary sovereign!\n\nMaster Pingshu said: *\"If li and kan lack wu and ji, though the four images unite, the elixir will not form.\"* He also said: *\"The four images and five phases all depend on earth.\"* And again: *\"It is originally through wu and ji that they are wed.\"*\n\n**Direct Oral Instructions:**\nOne sees the heavenly stems and earthly branches but not wu and ji, yet wu and ji reside within heaven and earth. The same holds true within the human body. When heaven and earth have their time of wu and ji, so too does one’s own body. This is what is meant by *\"gazing up at heaven and looking down at oneself\"*—it is called stealing heaven and earth’s complete qi of wu and ji to supplement the insufficiency of wu and ji in one’s own body. The *Yinfu Jing* says: *\"Heaven has five thieves; those who see them prosper.\"* Thus it is said: *\"The myriad things steal from heaven; humans steal from the myriad things.\"*\n\nEarth’s alternate name is the cinnabar field. The cinnabar field and metal are all earth. Once one recognizes wu and ji, one may proceed with the work—this is called the *fire timing*.\n\n**Fire Timing:**\nFire timing is the five phases within the human body meeting with heaven and earth, the generative qi of returning to the origin gathering and dispersing within the central path. Initially, it does not require laborious circulation, exhalation and inhalation, or artful pretense in practice. All transformations are perfectly complete within a single moment. If one discusses it in terms of the sun and moon’s advance and retreat, there are naturally solar divisions, and one must not force it. If one speaks in terms of days, there is naturally a month’s yin and yang; the same applies to a month or a year.\n\nNow, if one considers the timing of days: one must perceive the mechanism of killing returning to life, the blade and the river chariot, and the door of death transforming into the door of life! Only then, after ten months, the fetal elixir is complete; after a hundred days, the work is accomplished; after twelve years, one ascends in flight—all lies herein!\n\n**Twelve Verses on the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir to Dispel Delusion:**\n\n**Not Chan Buddhism:**\nThe golden elixir entirely depends on receiving the mind-to-mind transmission,\nUnlike the empty gate’s practice of seated meditation.\nThe medicine has its cooking and firing,\nWhen the yang spirit’s qi is sufficient, one becomes an immortal.\n\n**Not Visualization:**\nThe great Dao does not involve visualization or imagination,\nMercury and lead are not black and essence.\nTo know the priceless treasure of long life,\nThe luminous pearl shines brightly all night.\n\n**Not Ritual Practice:**\nBurning incense, clicking teeth, and visualizing spirits,\nGrasping mudras, writing talismans, and summoning the myriad spirits—\nSuch efforts are not the supreme Dao,\nFor within the true, there is yet the primordial true.\n\n**Not the Five Viscera:**\nMercury and lead are the forms of kan and li,\nThe marvelous maiden and infant, tiger and dragon.\nThey are not the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, or kidneys,\nThe true origin lies separately in the crystal palace.\n\n**Not Bedchamber Arts:**\nCultivating the elixir entirely depends on cutting off lust and delusion,\nSpeaking of the bedchamber is foolishness.\nThe Supreme Lord’s immortals are of the pure and still,\nHow could the filthy and turbid establish the foundation of the elixir?\n\n**Seeking the Root:**\nEver since the Supreme Ultimate divided into heaven and earth,\nThe ancestral qi and root origin have ceased to exist.\nEven plants and trees can seek their firm root,\nCultivating the true entirely depends on learning to return to the root.\n\n**Recognizing the Medicinal Substances:**\nEast Flower gazes toward White Tortoise Terrace,\nThe golden tower looms majestically before it.\nThen one sees the true person ascending to the jade palace,\nIn stillness, hearing the thunderous roar.\n\n**Knowing the True Earth:**\nYin and yang copulate and cook themselves,\nWithout aligning with the center, the marvel is incomplete.\nWhen did heaven and earth ever have wu and ji?\nSeek the true earth in the mind-to-mind transmission.\n\n**Awakening to Fire Timing:**\nThe mechanism of fire timing’s advance and retreat,\nThe subtle workings of waxing and waning—ponder them deeply.\nDo you yet know the three refrains of the jade zither?\nThe divine light of the precious tripod gently soars.\n\n**Viewing the Elixir Chamber:**\nThe valley spirit’s mysterious female is the elixir chamber,\nThis is the formula for long life and immortality.\nWithin it, the numinous embryo’s junction,\nPure yin is entirely stripped away, transforming into pure yang.\n\n**Forming the Immortal Embryo:**\nOnce the embryo is formed, the jade furnace warms,\nQi returns yang and restores the original root.\nSoaring, diving, concealing, and hiding—all are within me,\nFor outside the body, there is another body.\n\n**Diligence from Beginning to End:**\nThe immortals’ marvelous secret is not trivial,\nThough hard to encounter, know that it is easily accomplished.\nThe work of advancing fire must not cease,\nWhen the yang spirit bursts forth, one ascends in flight.\n\n**Postscript:**\nImmortality can be learned; deathlessness can be attained through effort. The ancients spoke thus, and it is no lie!\n\nJuchuan of the world was born in Piling. His great-great-grandfather, the Junior Preceptor Duke Jin, ranked first in the imperial examinations during the reign of Huizong and associated with immortals and alchemists. The family transmitted the *Diagram of the Golden Elixir*, which he showed to Lin Lingsu, saying: *\"This is Chen Tuan’s marvelous secret.\"* Lin Lingsu grasped its essence, but the great-great-grandfather’s path diverged from the Dao, and he listened as if chewing wax, unable to awaken. He then passed it to Guo Sanyi, Grand Marshal of the Bureau of Military Affairs, who was the father of the great-great-grandmother, the Lady of Yue State, née Guo. Guo was fond of the Dao but could not fully investigate its matters, so the diagram remained in the family’s possession.\n\nAfter another ninety years, during the Jiading era, the late father, the Lord of Shanggu Prefecture, suddenly encountered the barefoot Chen the True Person of Mount Wudang, who first transmitted this Dao. Upon returning, he studied the old diagram, and it matched perfectly. He then added oral instructions and annotations, intending to publish it, but the late father passed away.\n\nJuchuan lamented the lack of transmission of the mysterious learning and feared this book’s obscurity. Thus, he made a vow before heaven at the incense altar and commanded craftsmen to carve the woodblocks, continuing his late father’s aspiration.",

Yet, burdened by their cravings and desires, they cannot steel their resolve or persevere in practice, often halting midway.

Since my youth, I practiced quietude, but my late father, fearing I would neglect my scholarly pursuits, repeatedly forbade me. Yet, I could not desist. In my early twenties, extraordinary affairs and worldly gains—fame’s shackles and profit’s snares—occupied my thoughts, and I did not turn to this path.\n\nLater, my late father transmitted his oral instructions to various disciples. Among the noble and eminent of the age, some heard and practiced, some practiced but not diligently, and some delighted in hearing but not in doing. I alone received my late father’s innermost transmission. He admonished me, saying: *\"I attained the Dao of immortals but lacked the fortune of immortals. Now, I am old. My mystical practice has been intermittent, and I have not completed the work. My spiritual dwelling decays, and soon I must depart. I have a debt of gratitude to Jiezhai; you may entrust him with this great matter.\"*\n\nIn the auspicious month of the jia-yin year, I traveled to Shuchuan, where I drank with Jiezhai in joyous abandon.

You have a son to entrust; think no more of it.\"*\n\nAh! Had my late father possessed the strength to complete his Dao, how much more would he have achieved! Thus, I record these events after the cinnabar diagram.\n\nWith a hundred bows, I respectfully transcribe the preface by the late Grand Councilor Guo:\n\n*\"Reading the ‘Biography of Zhang Liang’ in the* Han History*, I marveled at how he received the book from the Yellow Stone Elder—was this not extraordinary? With ease and laughter, he aided the rise of a dynasty, surpassing all others. Truly, he had something to rely upon. Yet, the* Biography *states that the book was but a single scroll, the* Art of War of the Grand Duke*. Today, that text circulates in the world, and all may read it. What Zhang Liang received must have been far more than this. I believe its profound essence was kept secret and not transmitted. Later, I observed that Huo Duanda’s family had preserved the book for generations, its origins unknown. Lin Lingsu saw it and deemed it a work transmitted from Chen Tuan’s heart. Huo personally showed it to me—indeed, it was a wondrous book. I sought and obtained it. Later, I presented it to Lin Lingsu, who confirmed its true essence. Once, while crossing the sea to Mount Haishan in Goryeo, I encountered many perils. Yet, after testing it, I found it unfailingly efficacious—a treasure for one’s person! Truly, it should be passed to my descendants. Alas, I could not transmit it widely, so I write this preface as a warning.*\n\n*—Guo Sanyi’s preface, written on the third day of the eleventh month in the first year of Xuanhe (1119).*\n\nThe Prefect of Shanggu, Lord Huo, styled Boyu, was a native of Piling. A descendant of the Grand Preceptor of Jin, he passed the imperial examination with highest honors in the Chongning era. From birth, he was wise and quick-witted, mastering the mysteries of the Nine Schools and the hundred traditions. Unrestrained and magnanimous, he scattered wealth to aid others, rushing to relieve suffering as if it were his own. Once, he encountered a sage who transmitted to him the cinnabar formula and the Dao of corpse-liberation. In the winter of the jia-yin year, without illness, he manifested transformation in the private studio of Zhao Guanwen of Leichuan.\"",

He then added oral instructions and annotations, intending to publish it, but the late father passed away.\n\nJuchuan lamented the lack of transmission of the mysterious learning and feared this book’s obscurity. Thus, he made a vow before heaven at the incense altar and commanded craftsmen to carve the woodblocks, continuing his late father’s aspiration.",
