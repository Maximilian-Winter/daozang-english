  "full_translation": "**The Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue: Commentary**\n*(Title: The Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue—Commentary. Also known as The Riverbank Elder’s Chaptered Exegesis.)*\nTransmitted as composed by the Western Han recluse Riverbank He (Heshang Gong), who taught Emperor Wen of Han. Some attribute it to the Eastern Han. Four volumes. Base text source: *The Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, in the *Tongshen* (Cavernous Gods) section of the *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) category.\nCollated editions:\n1. *Siku Quanshu* reprint of the Song-era Jian’an Yu Family edition (hereafter, *Shadow Song Edition*).\n2. Dunhuang manuscripts S.477 and S.3926.\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on the Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue**\n*Volume One: The Riverbank Elder’s Chaptered Exegesis*\n\n**Chapter 1: Cultivating the Dao**\n\n*\"The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao.\"*\n—Refers to the Dao of learning, governance, and teaching.\n*\"The eternal Dao cannot be spoken of.\"*\n—Not the Dao of natural longevity.\n\nThe eternal Dao lies in:\n- Nurturing the spirit through *wuwei* (non-action),\n- Governing without interference,\n- Concealing brilliance like jade in shadow,\n- Erasing traces like water in the wind—\nThus, it cannot be named.\n\n*\"The name that can be named is not the eternal name.\"*\n—Refers to wealth, honor, and worldly eminence.\n*\"The eternal name cannot be named.\"*\n—Not a name that endures by nature.\n\nThe eternal name is like:\n- An infant before speech,\n- An egg before cracking,\n- A pearl in its shell,\n- A gem in stone—\nInternally luminous, externally dull.\n\n*\"The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n—The nameless is the Dao.\nThe Dao is formless, hence unnameable.\n*\"Origin\"* refers to the Dao’s foundation.\nFrom the void, it breathes *qi* and spreads transformation,\nBecoming the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\n*\"The named is the mother of ten thousand things.\"*\n—The named refers to Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth have form, position, yin-yang#1, and rigidity-flexibility—\nThese are their names.\n*\"Mother of ten thousand things\"*—\nHeaven and Earth contain *qi*, giving birth, nurturing, and maturing all things,\nLike a mother rearing her child.\n\nThus, *\"ever without desire, to observe its subtlety\"*#3—\n*\"Subtlety\"* means *key*.\nIf one constantly lacks desire, they perceive the Dao’s essential truth.\n*\"Key\"* means *oneness*.\nOneness issues forth, naming the Dao and distinguishing right from wrong.\n\n*\"Ever with desire, to observe its consequences.\"*\n*\"Consequences\"* means *return*.\nThose with desire reveal where the world’s pursuits lead.\n\nThese two—\nSame origin, different names.\nSame origin: both arise from human nature.\nDifferent names: their objects differ.\nThe nameless endures; the named perishes.\n\n*\"The two are called the Mysterious.\"*\n*\"Mysterious\"* means *Heavenly*.\nThose with and without desire both draw *qi* from Heaven.\n*\"Mysterious yet more mysterious\"*—\nWithin Heaven lies another Heaven.\nThick or thin in one’s *qi* intake:\nBalanced harmony yields sages;\nTurbulence and filth yield greed and lust.\n\n*\"The gateway of all subtleties.\"*\nTo know Heaven within Heaven,\nTo discern *qi*’s thickness or thinness,\nTo purge desire and uphold balance—\nThis is the threshold of Daoic insight.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 2: Nurturing the Body**\n\n*\"All under Heaven know beauty when they see it—*\nThey flaunt it, making it conspicuous.\n*Thus, it becomes ugliness.*\nDanger and ruin follow.\n*All know goodness when they see it—*\nThey seek it for merit and fame.\n*Thus, it becomes ungoodness.*\nMen contend for it.\nHence, having and lacking give rise to each other—\nSeeing ‘having’ as ‘lacking.’\nDifficulty and ease form each other—\nSeeing ‘difficulty’ as ‘ease.’\nLong and short define each other—\nSeeing ‘short’ through ‘long.’\nHigh and low incline toward each other—\nSeeing ‘low’ through ‘high.’\nSounds harmonize—\nThe lower must respond to the upper.\nFront and back follow—\nThe lower must follow the upper.\nThus, the Sage acts in *wuwei*,\nGoverning through the Dao.\nTeaching without words,\nModeling with the body.\nAll things act without complaint,\nYet none are coerced.\nGiving life without possession,\nLike *yuanqi* (original *qi*) birthing all things without claim.\nActing without reliance,\nThe Dao’s work seeks no reward.\nWhen the deed is done, retreat—\nThe Sage does not dwell on achievement.\n*Only by not dwelling does it not depart.*\nVirtue remains, never leaving the body.\n\nThis says:\n*\"The unspoken cannot be followed;\nThe unsaid cannot be known as urgent.\"*#4\n\n---\n**Chapter 3: Settling the People**\n\n*\"Do not exalt the virtuous...\"*\n\nThe virtuous here refers to the worldly wise.\nWith eloquence and polished speech,\nThey abandon the Dao, relying on clever schemes,\nDiscarding sincerity for artifice.\nTo not exalt them means\nNot to honor them with rank or wealth,\nNor to elevate them with office.\nThus, the people do not vie for distinction.\n\nNot striving for fame or merit—\nThis is the natural way.\n\nNot to prize rare treasures—\nFor when rulers do not hoard precious gems,\nGold lies abandoned in the hills,\nPearls sink forgotten in the depths.\nThus, the people do not turn to theft.\n\nWhen the ruler’s virtue is pure and clear,\nThe people below are free from greed.\nWhat is not seen as desirable\nIs abandoned—\nBanish the music of Zheng,\nKeep distant the flatterers.\nThus, the heart remains undisturbed.\n\nNo licentiousness takes root.\n\nTherefore, the Sage’s governance—\nWhether of state or self—\nEmpties the mind,\nDiscarding cravings and excess,\nDispelling agitation.\n\nFills the belly,\nHolding fast to the Dao, embracing unity,\nGuarding the Five Spirits.\n\nWeakens the will,\nCultivating softness, gentleness, humility,\nNot clinging to power.\n\nStrengthens the bones,\nCherishing essence, applying nourishment,\nSo marrow fills and bones grow firm.\n\nEver keep the people\nIn ignorance of knowledge, free of desire,\nReturning to simplicity, guarding purity.\n\nThe wise dare not act.\nDeep in thought, they speak not lightly.\nThey act without action,\nCreate nothing, move with measured ease—\nThen nothing remains untended.\n\nTheir virtue profound, the people rest in peace.\n\n**Fourth: The Dao’s Subtle Power**\nThe Dao flows yet acts—\nSubtle, it dwells within.\nIt hides its name, conceals its merit,\nIts work unseen, yet ever present.\nIt never overflows.\n\nThe Dao is ever modest, never full.\nDeep as the source of all things,\nIt seems the ancestor of ten thousand forms.\nIt blunts the sharp—\nThe sharpness of ambition—\nSo the Dao remains unseen.\n\nIt unravels entanglements—\nThe knots of resentment—\nBy embracing non-action.\nIt dims its brilliance—\nThough wisdom shines, it must not dazzle others.\nIt aligns with the common dust—\nNo separation, no distinction.\nStill as the depths, yet ever present.\n\nI know not whence it comes—\nBefore the Emperor of Heaven,\nIt endures through stillness, untroubled.\nTo guide the self in the Dao’s way.\n\n**Fifth: The Virtue of Emptiness**\nHeaven and Earth are not kind—\nThey nourish and transform without favor,\nTreating all things as straw dogs.\nThe Sage is not kind—\nNurturing the people without favor,\nTreating them as straw dogs.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nIf one clears the passions, discards tastes,\nPurifies the Five Organs,\nThe spirits dwell within.\nLike the hollow gourd—\nEmpty yet resonant—\nThe more it moves, the more it yields sound.\nEmpty yet unbroken, moving yet ever flowing.\nMuch speech brings exhaustion,\nMuch action harms the spirit.\nBetter to guard the center,\nNurturing the spirit, cherishing qi, speaking little.\n\n**Sixth: The Form of Perfection**\nThe Valley Spirit never dies—\nNurture the spirit, and death is undone.\nThe spirit of the Five Organs:\nThe liver houses the soul,\nThe lungs the ethereal breath,\nThe heart the spirit,\nThe spleen the intent,\nThe kidneys the essence and will.\nWhen all five are harmed, the spirits depart.\n\nThis is called the Mysterious Female—\nThe way of immortality lies within.\nMysterious—Heaven, in man the nose—\nThe nose breathes the Five Qi from Heaven into the heart,\nRefining them into spirit, clarity, voice, and five natures.\nIts ghost is the soul—\nThe soul is male, entering and exiting through the nose,\nCommuning with Heaven—\nThus the nose is called Mysterious.\n\nThe Female—Earth, in man the mouth—\nThe mouth takes the Five Flavors from Earth into the stomach,\nCoarsening them into form, flesh, blood, and the Six Emotions.\nIts ghost is the ethereal breath—\nThe ethereal breath is female, entering and exiting through the mouth,\nCommuning with Earth—\nThus the mouth is called Female.\n\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female\nIs the root of Heaven and Earth—\nThe root, the origin.\nThe gate of nose and mouth\nIs where the primal qi of Heaven and Earth circulates.\n\nBreathing must be subtle, as if present, yet as if not.\nQi should flow gently, never strained.\n\n**Seventh: Concealing Brilliance**\nHeaven endures, Earth persists—\nTeaching mortals to endure.\nHeaven and Earth endure long\nBecause they do not strive to live—\nThey rest in nature, giving without seeking return,\nUnlike mortals who exhaust themselves for private gain.\nThus they endure forever.\n\nThe Sage places himself last,\nYet is placed first.\nHe sets himself aside,\nYet is preserved.\nThe people love him as parents,\nRevere him as gods,\nCherish him as their own.\nThus he endures.\n\nBecause he is without self,\nHe fulfills his own.\n\n**Eighth: Transforming Nature**\nThe highest goodness is like water.\nWater benefits all things\nYet does not contend.\nIt dwells where others scorn—\nLow, damp, filthy, murky—\nThus it nears the Dao.\n\nIt rests in lowly places,\nIts heart is deep.\nIt associates with the good,\nGiving to the worthy, not the full.\n\nIts truth is reflected—\nWater mirrors forms without deceit.\n\n**Ninth: Flowing Evenly**\nGovern well, and nothing remains unclean—\nClear and level, like water’s flow.\nAct skillfully, and you adapt—\nSquare when straight, round when curved,\nFlexing to fit each form.\n\nMove in due time—\nDispersing in summer, congealing in winter,\nActing when the season demands,\nNever losing the Way of Heaven.\n\nOnly the non-contending\nIs blocked, it stops;\nReleased, it flows—\nObedient to human will.\nThus it incurs no blame.\nWater’s nature is such—\nNo one in the world blames water.\n\n**Tenth: The Power of Virtue**\nHold to fullness, yet stop before completion.\nFullness means excess;\nStopping means restraint.\nTo cling to fullness is to invite collapse—\nBetter to halt in time.\n\nShape with sharpness, yet it cannot endure.\n\"Shape\" means to refine—\nFirst you refine, then you discard.\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can keep them.\nIndulgence harms the spirit,\nWealth burdens the body.\nRiches and honor breed arrogance—\nSelf-inflicted ruin follows.\n\nWhen wealth should relieve the poor,\nWhen honor should cherish the lowly,\nYet pride takes root—\nDisaster will come.\nWhen deeds are done,\nWhen fame is secured,\nWithdraw—\nThis is Heaven’s Way.\nFor what is done at high noon must move,\nWhat is full must wane,\nWhat is excessive must decline,\nJoy at its peak turns to sorrow.\n\n**Eleventh: Nurturing Vitality**\nCarry the spirit-souls—\nThe spirit-souls are the *hun* and *po*.\nHumans rely on them to live—\nCherish and nourish them.\nJoy and rage scatter the spirit,\nSudden fright harms the soul.\nThe spirit dwells in the liver,\nThe soul in the lungs.\nFine wine and rich foods damage them.\nThus, when the spirit is calm and the mind aligned,\nThe soul rests, and life is prolonged.\n\nCan one not hold to Oneness?\nIf one embraces Oneness,\nIt will not depart.\nOneness is the essence of virtue and Dao,\nThe refined *qi* of Great Harmony.\nThus it is called Oneness.\nOneness spreads through the world—\nHeaven gains Oneness and becomes clear,\nEarth gains Oneness and becomes tranquil,\nRulers gain Oneness and achieve rectitude.\nWithin, it is the heart;\nWithout, it is action.\nGenerosity is its virtue—\nAll called Oneness.\nOneness means single-mindedness,\nWithout division.\n\nFocus the *qi* to attain softness—\nGuard the vital essence so it does not scatter,\nAnd the body will respond with yielding grace.\n\nCan you be like an infant?\nWithin, no scheming;\nWithout, no governance—\nThen the spirit remains undisturbed.\n\nPurify and gaze into the void—\nCleanse the heart to make it pure.\nThe heart dwells in the profound darkness,\nPerceiving all things—\nThus it is called *xuanlan* [profound vision].\nCan you remain without blemish?\nDo not indulge in depravity.\n\n「To love the people and govern the state,\nTo govern the self—\nReceiving *qi* preserves the body whole.\nTo govern the state—\nLoving the people secures the realm’s peace.\nCan you be without action?\nTo govern the self—\nBreathing *jingqi* [精气], without letting it be heard by the ears.\nTo govern the state—\nDispensing virtue and benevolence, without letting the people below know of it.\nThe Celestial Gate opens and shuts—\nThe Celestial Gate, the North Pole’s Purple Forbidden Enclosure [北极紫微宫].\nOpening and shutting, the five phases of beginning and end.\nThe Celestial Gate of governing the self refers to the nostrils—\nOpening means panting,\nShutting means breathing.\nCan you be without duality?\nTo govern the self, one should be like the female and male—\nStable, tranquil, soft, and weak.\nTo govern the state, one adapts to circumstances—\nHarmonious yet not boastful.\n\nIlluminating and far-reaching—\nThe Dao is clear as the sun and moon,\nFourfold and boundless beyond the eight extremes of the world.\nThus it is said:\n*\"To see yet not be seen,\nTo hear yet not be heard,\nTo manifest in all ten directions,\nResplendent and radiant beyond measure.\"*\nCan you be without knowing?\nThere is none who can know the Dao’s fulfillment throughout the world.\n\nNurturing and sustaining—\nThe Dao generates all things and sustains them.\nGenerating yet not possessing—\nThe Dao generates all things, yet takes none for itself.\nActing yet not relying—\nThe Dao’s deeds are done without expectation of reward.\nLengthening yet not slaughtering—\nThe Dao nourishes all things without carving or using them as tools.\nThis is called *xuande* [profound virtue].\nThe Dao’s virtue is profound and dark,\nDesiring to make people know it yet unseen.\n\nThe Tenth Principle of Non-Utilization\nThirty spokes join one hub—\nAncient chariots had thirty spokes,\nA measure of the moon’s cycles.\nAll spokes converge at a single hub,\nFor the hub has a hollow core,\nAnd thus the spokes gather around it.\nTo govern the self, one must purge emotions and desires,\nEmpty the five *zang* [内脏],\nSo that the spirit may return.\nWhen the hub is hollow, the chariot’s function is fulfilled;\nWhen the self is emptied, its purpose is realized.\nThe hub’s emptiness allows the wheels to turn;\nThe center’s void lets the carriage bear its load.\nMolding clay to make vessels—\n*Bing* [埏] means blending,\n*Zhi* [埴] means earth.\nBlending earth to craft utensils for food and drink.\nWhen the vessel is hollow, its use is fulfilled;\nThe vessel’s emptiness allows it to receive.\nPiercing doors and windows to make a dwelling—\nTo construct rooms and houses.\nWhen the dwelling is hollow, its use is fulfilled.\nThe doors and windows’ emptiness lets people enter and exit;\nThe dwelling’s emptiness lets people reside within.\nThus, having is for utility—\n*Li* [利], meaning \"things.\"\nThings manifest in use—\nThe vessel contains objects,\nThe dwelling holds people,\nYet fear that the house may be destroyed;\nFear that the body’s spirit may perish.\nThe principle of non-utilization—\nThe hollow void alone can embrace all forms.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The empty and the void can govern the having and the form.\"*\nThe Dao is the empty and the void.\n\nThe Eleventh Principle of Restrained Desire\nThe five colors blind the eyes—\nLusting after the five colors,\nThe vital essence is drained, and clarity is lost;\nOne cannot perceive the colorless.\nThe five tones deaf the ears—\nEnjoying the five tones,\nThe harmonious *qi* departs the heart,\nAnd one cannot hear the soundless.\nThe five flavors dull the palate—\n*Shuang* [爽], meaning \"to lose.\"\nIndulging in the five flavors,\nOne loses the Dao’s true taste.\nChasing and hunting in the fields cause the mind to go mad—\nThe spirit prefers tranquility;\nExcessive movement scatters the essence,\nThus the mind goes mad.\nHard-to-obtain treasures bring hindrance to conduct—\n*Fang* [妨], meaning \"to harm.\"\nGold, silver, jade, and pearls—\nThe heart is burdened by greed,\nIgnorant of contentment,\nAnd thus one’s actions harm the body and bring disgrace.\nTherefore, the sage governs the belly—\nGuarding the five *xing* [性],\nDiscarding the six *qing* [情],\nModerating the will,\nNurturing the spirit and clarity.\nNot the eyes—\nThe eyes do not gaze wantonly,\nFor wanton gazing drains the essence outward.\nThus, discard that and take this—\nDiscard the eyes’ wanton gazing,\nTake the belly’s spirit-nurturing.\nThe Thirteenth Principle of Satiety and Shame\nHonor and disgrace like a startling alarm—\nTo be honored is to be startled,\nTo be disgraced is to be startled.\nGreat calamities are feared like they touch the self—\n*Gui* [贵], meaning \"to revere.\"\n*Ran* [患], meaning \"calamity.\"\nWhen great calamities approach the self,\nThus one is startled.\nWhat is meant by honor and disgrace?\nAsking what is honor, what is disgrace.\nHonor is dignity and glory,\nDisgrace is shame and debasement.\nTo receive honor and glory like a startling alarm—\nTo attain high station is to be startled,\nAs if standing at the edge of danger.\nWealth does not dare to be extravagant,\nStatus does not dare to be arrogant.\nTo lose honor and glory like a startling alarm—\nTo lose favor is to be disgraced,\nAnd one is startled by fear that calamity will return.\nThis is called *\"honor and disgrace like a startling alarm.\"*\n\nTo resolve the above—\nTo receive honor and glory like a startling alarm,\nTo lose it like a startling alarm.\nWhat is meant by *\"great calamities are feared like they touch the self\"*?\nReturning to the question—\nMy great calamity arises from my having a self.\nMy great calamity arises from my having a self.\nHaving a self brings worry of toil,\nReflection on hunger and cold.\nIndulging in emotions and desires,\nThen calamity befalls.\nWhen I have no self,\nWhat calamity do I have?\nIf I have no self,\nMy body aligns with the Dao naturally—\nLightly ascending to the clouds,\nEntering and exiting without obstruction,\nCommuning with the Dao’s spirit,\nWhat calamity could there be?\nThus, the noble who values the self above the world\nCan entrust themselves to the world—\nThe ruler holds their self in high regard,\nYet devalues the people,\nDesiring to be the world’s master,\nAnd thus can rely on the world yet not be trusted.\nThe loving who values the self above the world\nCan entrust the world to themselves—\nThe ruler who loves their self,\nNot for themselves alone,\nBut as the parent of all people,\nWith this virtue as the world’s sovereign,\nCan entrust their self to the people above,\nEnduring no blame for long.\n\nThe Fourteenth Principle of Praising the Profound\n*\"To see yet not be seen\"* is called *yi* [夷]—\nThe colorless is *yi*.\nThe Dao is without hue,\nAnd thus cannot be seen.\n*\"To hear yet not be heard\"* is called *xi* [希]—\nThe soundless is *xi*.\nThe Dao is without sound,\nAnd thus cannot be heard.\n*\"To grasp yet not obtain\"* is called *wei* [微]—\nThe formless is *wei*.\nThe Dao is without substance,\nAnd thus cannot be seized.»\n\n---\n\nThis triad cannot be questioned or examined,\nThree things: *yi* [夷], *xi* [希], and *wei* [微].\nThat which cannot be questioned or examined—\nIt is the colorless, the soundless, the formless.\nThe mouth cannot speak of it,\nThe written word cannot transmit it.\nReceived in stillness, sought with the spirit,\nIt cannot be questioned yet is known.\n\nThus, it blends into oneness.\n*Hun* [混] means to merge.\nTherefore, the three names unite as one.\nAbove, it shines without brightness—\nThe one in the heavens,\nNot dimly luminous, yet boundless above and below.\nBelow, it is without obscurity—\nThe one in the world,\nNot dimly veiled in darkness or hidden depths.\n\nIt flows ceaselessly, yet cannot be named—\n*Shuangshuang* [绳绳], ceaseless motion.\nIt cannot be named,\nNot a single hue—\nNot distinguishable by blue, yellow, red, white, or black.\nNot a single sound—\nNot discerned by the five tones of *gōng* [宫], *shāng* [商], *jué* [角], *zhǐ* [征], or *yǔ* [羽].\nNot a single form—\nNot measured by length, shortness, smallness, or greatness.\nReturning to the formless.\n\n*Wu* [物] means substance.\nSubstance must return to the formless.\nThis is called the *state* [状] of the formless—\nThe one without form yet able to shape all things.\nThe *image* [象] of the formless—\nThe one without substance yet able to manifest all forms.\nThis is called *hūhuǎng* [忽恍]—\nThe one that is indistinct, as if present or absent,\nUnseen.\n\nTo meet it, you cannot see its beginning—\nThe one without start or end,\nUnpredictable.\nTo abandon passions and desires,\nThe one returns to itself#11.\n\nTo follow it, you cannot see its trace—\nThe one without shadow or mark,\nUnseen.\nTo hold the ancient Dao,\nAnd thus govern the present—\nThe sage grasps the ancient Dao,\nGenerates the one to govern all things,\nKnows that the present must also return to the one.\nTo know the ancient origin,\nThis is called the *Dao*’s *jì* [纪].\n\nIf one can know the ancient origin of the one,\nThis is called knowing the *Dao*’s fundamental threads.\n**The Fifteenth Principle of Manifesting Virtue**\n\nThe ancient adept at being a *shì* [士]—\nThe ruler who obtained the Dao.\nSubtle and profound, penetrating the heavens,\nHeavenly [玄] refers to the Dao.\nTheir resolve and conduct are profound and subtle,\nTheir spirit in harmony with the Dao.\nDeep beyond recognition.\n\nVirtue and power are profound and distant,\nBeyond recognition.\nInternally, they see as if blind,\nThey turn and hear as if deaf,\nNone know their excellence.\n\nOnly because it cannot be recognized,\nThey forcefully assume its guise—\nThat is to say: the following lines.\n\n*Yù* [豫]—like winter crossing a river,\nCautious and deliberate in all actions,\n*Yùyù* [豫豫]—like winter crossing a river,\nTheir heart finds it difficult.\n*Yóu* [犹]—like fearing the four neighbors,\nTheir advance is hesitant, as if restrained,\nLike one who has broken the law,\nFeared for the four neighbors’ judgment.\n*Yǎn* [俨]—like a guest,\nAs a guest before their host,\nThey are dignified yet unassuming.\n*Huàn* [涣]—like ice about to dissolve,\n*Huàn* means to disperse,\n*Shì* [释] means to vanish,\nThat is to say: abandoning passions and desires,\nDaily emptiness.\n*Dūn* [敦]—like undifferentiated simplicity,\n*Dūn* means solid and thick,\n*Pǔ* [朴] means unrefined form,\nInternally guarding the spirit,\nExternally without ornamentation.\n*Kuàng* [旷]—like a valley,\n*Kuàng* means vast and spacious,\nA *gǔ* [谷]#12 is emptiness,\nWithout virtue, achievement, or name,\nYet encompassing all.\n*Hún* [浑]—like turbid water,\n*Hún* means to preserve their true nature,\nTurbid [浊] means not clearly evident,\nIn harmony with the common yet not self-exalted.\n\nWho can, like turbid water,\nCease and settle, then gradually clear?\nWho can, with stillness,\nEndure motion for long, then gradually arise?\n\nThose who preserve this Dao\nDo not desire excess.\nPreserving this Dao of longevity,\nThey do not desire indulgence or overflow.\nOnly because they do not overflow,\nThey can endure wear without renewal.\n\nOnly those who do not overflow\nCan guard against decay,\nHiding their brilliance.\nRenewal means valuing achievement and name.\n\n**The Sixteenth Principle of Returning to the Root**\n\nReach the utmost emptiness—\n*Zhì* [致] means to attain.\nThe Daoist abandons passions and desires,\nThe five *zàng* [藏] organs are pure and still,\nAttaining the utmost emptiness.\nGuard steadfast stillness—\nGuard purity and stillness,\nPractice with sincerity and depth.\n\nAll things arise together—\n*Zuò* [作] means to generate.\nAll things generate together.\nWith this, I observe their return.\n\nThat is to say: I observe all things\nReturning to their origin,\nHumans must cherish their root.\n\nThings are abundant and flourishing—\n*Yún yún* [芸芸], the appearance of blossoms and leaves.\nEach returns to its root.\nThat is to say: all things\nWithout fail wither and fall,\nReturning to their root to regenerate.\nReturning to the root is called stillness—\nStillness refers to the root.\nThe root is tranquil, soft, and weak,\nHumble and lowly, thus it does not die again.\nStillness is called returning to *mìng* [命]—\nTo be able to remain tranquil\nIs called returning to one’s original nature and vitality,\nThus one does not die.\nReturning to *mìng* is called *cháng* [常]—\nReturning to *mìng* prevents death,\nThis is the Dao’s eternal practice.\nKnowing *cháng* is called *míng* [明]—\nTo know the Dao’s eternal practice\nIs called enlightenment.\nNot knowing *cháng*, yet acting arbitrarily,\nIs perilous.\nKnowing *cháng*, one is inclusive—\nTo know the Dao’s eternal practice,\nOne abandons passions and desires,\nEmbracing all without exception.\n\nTo embrace is to be impartial—\nWithout exception, one is impartial and just,\nAll evils cannot withstand.\nImpartiality is called *wáng* [王]—\nImpartial and just,\nOne can rule the world,\nCorrecting the body’s essence,\nForm unified and still,\nSpirit enlightened for myriad ages,\nAll converging within oneself.\n*Wáng* is called *tiān* [天]—\nTo rule is to harmonize with virtue,\nSpirit enlightened now communicates with heaven.\nHeaven is called *Dào* [道]—\nVirtue harmonizes with heaven,\nThus it unites with the Dao.\nThe Dao is called *jiǔ* [久]—\nTo unite with the Dao is to endure.\nTo perish without harm—\nTo be impartial, to rule,\nHarmonizing with heaven and uniting with the Dao,\nAll four perfected,\nVirtue and power vast and distant,\nNo misfortune or blame,\nThus one perishes with heaven and earth,\nNever in peril.\n\nThe *True Classic of the Dao and Virtue* (Annotations, Scroll One)\n\n**1.

Concealing Brilliance and Glory:**\n*(\"荣\" [róng, \"glory\"] originally written as \"盈\" [yíng, \"full\"], corrected per the *Shadow Song* edition.)*\n\n---\n*The True Classic of the Dao and Virtue* (Annotations, Scroll Two)\n*Commentary by Master He Shanggong*\n\n**17. The Primordial Wind:**\nThe Most High, the lowest know of His existence.\nThe Most High refers to the sovereign of the primordial age, before names were given.\nThe lowest know of His existence yet do not serve Him—this is the simplicity of the unrefined.\n\nThe next stage: they are close to Him and praise Him.\nHis virtue is visible, His benevolence and grace are worthy of praise,\nso they love and honor Him.\n\nThe next stage: they fear Him.\nHe governs through laws and punishments.\n\nThe next stage: they scorn Him.\nHe imposes many prohibitions, causing confusion,\nand they cannot be brought to sincerity, so they deceive and mock Him.\n\nIf this is insufficient:\nWhen the sovereign’s trust is lacking among the people,\nthe people then deceive and betray him above.\nIf this is untrustworthy:\nWhen the sovereign’s trust is lacking among the people,\nthe people respond with their own lack of trust and deceive their sovereign.\n\nThus, the Most High values speech.\nThe sovereign of the primordial age acted with restraint,\nvaluing speech above all else,\nfor fear of straying from the Dao and losing naturalness.\n\nWhen achievements are complete and affairs settled,\nthe world is in great peace.\nThe people all say, \"This is natural.\"\nThe people do not know that the sovereign’s virtue is pure and profound,\nbut instead take it as their own inherent nature.\n\n**18. The Crassness of Custom:**\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned, there arises benevolence and righteousness.\nIn the age of the Great Dao,\nfamilies had filial children, states had loyal and trustworthy subjects,\nand benevolence and righteousness were not yet seen.\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned and not practiced,\nevil and perversity arise,\nand then benevolence and righteousness can be transmitted as the Dao.\n\nWhen wisdom appears, there arises great deceit.\nThe wise sovereigns devalue virtue and exalt speech,\ndevalue simplicity and exalt ornamentation,\nand the people respond with great deceit and cunningness.\n\nWhen the six bonds of kinship are severed, there arises filial piety and kindness.\nWhen the six bonds of kinship are broken and relatives do not harmonize,\nthen filial piety and kindness arise to nurture and care for them.\n\nWhen the state is in chaos and confusion, there arise loyal ministers.\nWhen governance fails and orders are not followed,\nthe ruler and subjects blame each other,\nwhile the wicked vie for power,\nthen loyal ministers arise to rectify their sovereign.\n\nThis is to say:\nIn the age of the Great Dao, the people do not know benevolence,\nwhen desires are fully satisfied, they do not know contentment,\nwhen each purifies themselves, they do not know integrity.\nThus, in the age of the Great Dao,\nfilial piety and kindness vanish,\nbenevolence and righteousness fade away—\njust as the sun and moon shine brightly,\nwhile the stars lose their luster.\n\n**19. Reverting to Simplicity:**\nAbandon the Sage...\n\nAbandon the Sage’s artifices, return to the origin, and uphold the primal Way.\nThe Five Emperors drew symbols, and Cang Jie created writing—\nyet this was not as effective as the Three Sovereigns’ knotted cords,\nwhich governed without scripture.\n\nAbandon wisdom,\nabandon cleverness and cunning,\nreturn to non-action.\nThe people’s benefits multiply a hundredfold;\nagriculture thrives, and public affairs are without private gain.\n\nAbandon benevolence and righteousness,\nabandon the cleverness that sees benevolence,\nabandon the ostentation that values righteousness.\nThe people return to filial piety and kindness—\nfor virtue’s transformation is pure.\n\nAbandon artifice.\nThose who abandon artifice prevent deceit from corrupting truth.\nAbandon profit,\nblock the paths of greed, and close the gates of power.\nThieves and robbers vanish.\nThe ruler’s transformation is public and just,\nand the people below have no private deceit.\nThese three are called the three uppermost affairs to abandon.\n\nBecause scripture is insufficient,\nbecause scripture is insufficient to transform the people,\ntherefore let governance have its proper place.\nAs the following verse states:\n\nEmbrace simplicity and preserve purity—\nto embrace simplicity is to hold fast to simplicity and truth,\nnot to value ornamentation.\nTo preserve purity is to manifest one’s natural sincerity to the world,\nso that it may be emulated.\nFewer private interests, fewer desires.\nTo have fewer private interests is to correct the absence of private gain.\nTo have fewer desires is to know contentment.\n\n**Chapter 20: Divergent Customs**\nAbandon learning.\n\n**Chapter 20: Divergent Customs** (continued)\n\nAbandon learning without attaining truth—\nthis does not align with the **Dao/Way** and its teachings.\nBe free from worries.\nEliminate superficiality and extravagance, then there will be no worries.\n\nWhat is the difference between *Zhi* and *A*?\nBoth are responses to the times,\nyet their difference is vast.\n\nThe rulers of our age despise genuine virtue\nand exalt mere ornamentation.\nHow far apart are good and evil?\nThe good are praised,\nthe evil are rebuked—\nhow can they truly be distinguished?\n\nThe rulers of our age prefer treacherous flatterers\nto loyal and upright ministers.\nWhat is it that people fear?\nPeople fear the **Dao/Way** of the learned.\nWhat they truly fear is the ruler who does not abandon learning.\nOne must indeed fear this.\n\nThe current rulers favor superficial display,\nslaying the virtuous and the wise.\nOh, the chaos—\nit knows no end!\n\nSpeaking of the vulgar masses,\nthey pursue learning only to indulge in empty ornamentation#3,\nyet their corruption cannot be halted.\n\nThe common people revel in excess,\nin licentiousness and indulgence,\nin boundless desires.\nLike feasting on the **Tailao** sacrificial offerings,\nthey crave abundance as if starving,\nyet their hunger is never satisfied.\nLike ascending a terrace in spring,\nspring, when *yin* and *yang* intermingle,\nand all things are stirred—\nto stand upon the terrace and gaze,\ntheir minds overflow with wantonness.\n\nYet I alone stand in dread,\nwithout any sign of desire.\nLike an infant before it speaks,\nor a younger sibling unable yet to answer others.\nI drift, drifting—\nas if without destination.\n\nI drift like one lost in the remote wilderness,\nwith nowhere to turn.\nWhile others have abundance,\nothers hoard wealth to indulge in luxury,\nand excess knowledge to deceive with.\nI alone seem cast aside,\nas though lacking—\nmy heart is that of a simpleton.\n\nI do not conform to the world,\nsteadfast in the One, unmoved,\nlike the heart of a simpleton.\n\nPure and unadulterated—\nwithout distinction or division.\nThe common people are bright and clear,\nilluminated and discerning.\n\nI alone seem dim—\nas though in darkness.\nOthers are keen and sharp,\nurgent and swift.\n\nI alone am murky—\nmurky, without division or separation.\nVast as the sea,\nI alone drift, drifting—\nlike the ebb and flow of rivers and oceans,\nunknown in their depths.\n\nI drift—\ndrifting like windborne dust or lifted feathers,\nwithout end,\nmy will and intent in the realm of the spirit.\n\nOthers all have *doings*—\nthey cling to action.\nYet I alone am obstinate,\nI alone do nothing,\nseeming crude.\nCrude, as though inadequate.\n\nI alone differ from others,\ndiffering from the crowd,\nyet I alone honor the *Mother*.\n*Mother*—the Dao.\nOnly I alone honor the Dao’s use.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Virtue of the Hollow**\n\nThe bearing of great virtue—\ngreat, vast—\none of great virtue contains all,\nable to receive filth and turbidity,\ndwelling in humility and openness.\nOnly the Dao is followed.\nOnly—uniquely—\none of great virtue does not conform to worldly ways,\nbut follows the Dao alone.\n\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nis only vague and indistinct.\nThe Dao, toward all things,\nuniquely drifts and vanishes,\nwithout fixed form.\n\nVague, indistinct—\nyet within it, there is substance.\nThe Dao is only vague and indistinct,\nyet within it, there is the One.\n\nIt nurtures and transforms life,\nestablishing form through *qi*.\nIndistinct, vague—\nyet within it, there are patterns.\nThe Dao is only profound and formless,\nyet within it, the laws of all things reside.\n\nProfound, dark—\nyet within it, there is essence.\nThe Dao is only profound and dark,\nyet within it lies the true essence,\nwhere divine and mortal intermingle,\nwhere *yin* and *yang* converge.\nIts essence is most true—\nthe Dao’s essence, *qi*, and spirit are most wondrous and true,\nwithout ornamentation.\nWithin it, there is sincerity.\nThe Dao conceals its deeds and hides its name,\nyet sincerity abides within.\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nits name does not fade—\nfrom, since.\nSince ancient times to now, the Dao remains ever-present.\nIt nourishes all beginnings.\n*Nourishes*—receives.\n*Beginnings*—origins.\nHow do I know all things begin thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe **Benef of Modesty** (Chapter 22)\n\nIf one bends, one is whole.\nBend oneself to follow the multitude,\ndo not assert oneself alone—\nthen one remains whole.\n\nIf one is crooked, one becomes straight.\nCrooked—bent.\nBending oneself while extending to others,\nover time, one naturally attains straightness for oneself.\n\nIf one is lowly, one is filled.\nThe earth is lowly and deep; water flows to it.\nHumility in a person—\nvirtue flows to them.\n\nIf one is afflicted, one is renewed.\nWhen one bears hardship lightly,\nputs others before oneself,\nthe world respects them—\nover time, one renews oneself.\n\nIf one is few, one gains much.\nWhen one receives little,\none obtains much in return.\n\nThe Dao favors the modest,\nthe spirits and *qi* benefit the humble.\nExcess leads to confusion.\nThose with much wealth—\nconfused by what they must guard.\nThose with much learning—\nconfused by what they must hear.\n\nThus, the Sage embraces unity as a model for all under heaven.\nEmbrace—guard.\nModel—law.\nThe Sage guards unity,\nknowing all things,\nthus able to serve as the law for all under heaven.\n\nNot self-assertive, hence clear.\nThe Sage does not use his own eyes to see beyond a thousand *li*,\nbut relies on the eyes of all under heaven to see,\nthus able to perceive and reach far.\n\nNot self-righteous, hence illustrious.\nThe Sage does not assume his own correctness while rejecting others,\nthus able to shine brightly in the world.\n\nNot self-praising, hence meritorious.\nPraise—take.\nThe Sage’s virtue spreads naturally,\nnot taking credit for his own excellence,\nthus his merit is recognized by all under heaven.\n\nNot self-glorifying, hence enduring.\nGlorify—magnify.\nThe Sage does not magnify his own greatness,\nthus able to endure without peril.\n\nOnly by not striving,\ndoes the world find none who can contend with them.\nThis means that all under heaven—\nwhether virtuous or unvirtuous—\nnone can contend with those who do not strive.\n\nThe ancients spoke of *\"bending brings wholeness\"*—\nwas this mere empty talk?\nPassed-down words: *\"Bend and follow, and one is whole,\"*\nproven true.\nThus, sincerity is whole and returns to its source.\nSincerity—reality.\nThose who can practice bending and following—\ntheir bodies are unharmed,\nreturning to their parents,\nwithout injury.\n\nThe **Vacuity of Nonbeing** (Chapter 23)\n\nRarely spoken of—\nnature’s spontaneity.\n\nThus, *\"rarely spoken\"* means loving speech.\nLoving speech is the Dao/Way of nature.\nGusts of wind do not last through the morning,\nsudden rains do not last through the day.\nGusts of wind—swift winds.\nSudden rains—torrent rains.\nSwiftness cannot endure,\nviolence cannot last.\nWho causes this?\nThe heavens and earth.\nWho causes these gusts and torrents?\nIt is the heavens and earth that do so.\nEven the heavens and earth cannot endure long,\ncannot persist from morning to evening.\nThen how much less can mortals?\nThe heavens and earth are most divine,\nyet when they combine to produce gusts and torrents,\nthey cannot even make them follow from morning to afternoon—\nhow much less can mortals, then, and desire to emulate their completion?\n\nThus, those who follow the Dao/Way,\n*\"follow\"* meaning to act in accordance with—\nwhen mortals act, they should be as tranquil as the Dao,\nnot as gusting and torrential.\nThose who follow the Dao/Way are in harmony with the Dao/Way,\nmeaning their actions align with the Dao.\nThose who embody **virtue/power** are in harmony with **virtue/power**,\nmeaning their actions align with **virtue/power**.\nThose who are lost are in harmony with loss.\n*\"Lost\"* means to burden oneself while neglecting others.\nThose in harmony with loss—\ntheir actions align with loss.\nThose in harmony with the Dao/Way, the Dao/Way delights in them;\nthose in harmony with **virtue/power**, **virtue/power** delights in them;\nthose in harmony with loss, loss delights in them.\nFaith is insufficient here—\nif a ruler lacks faith below,\nthe subjects respond with disbelief.\nThere is disbelief.\nThis speaks of things returning to their kind—\nlike sounds resonate, clouds follow the dragon, winds follow the tiger,\nwater flows to moisture, fire seeks dryness—\nthese are nature’s laws.\nThe **Virtue of Benevolence** (Chapter 24)\nThe **limping** do not stand,\n\nThe **limping** are those who advance.\nThey who covet power and usurp fame,\nwho seek glory and gain—\ncannot long stand firm in the Dao/Way.\n\nThe **straddling** do not walk.\nThey who exalt themselves above others,\nthe crowd conspires to obstruct them,\nso they cannot proceed.\n\nThe **self-seeing** are blind.\nMen who admire their own appearance as beautiful,\nwho deem their own actions the Dao/Way—\nthey fail to see their own ugliness,\ntheir own vulgar conduct.\n\nThe **self-righteous** are not renowned.\nThey who insist they are right while others are wrong—\nthe crowd conspires to obscure them,\nso they remain unillustrious.\n\nThe **self-praising** achieve nothing.\nThey who claim credit for their deeds,\nin truth, lose the merit of true contribution.\n\nThe **self-glorifying** do not endure.\nThey who boast of their greatness\ncannot long persist.\nIn the Dao/Way, they are called *\"excessive food, superfluous actions.\"*\nSuperfluous—meaning *noble* in excess.\nIf such men govern the state,\nthey tax and extort,\nhoarding surplus wealth—\ntheir actions are gluttonous.\nAll things recoil in hatred.\nWhen they hold office,\ntheir every move brings harm,\nso all fear and detest them.\nThus, the Dao/Way does not dwell there.\n\n**Symbol of the Origin** (Chapter 25)\nThere exists a formless, mixed unity,\nborn before Heaven and Earth.\nThis is the Dao/Way—\nshapeless, indistinct,\nyet giving birth to all things,\nexisting before Heaven and Earth.\n\nSilent and void,\nit stands alone, unchanging.\nSilent—without sound.\nVoid—without form.\nAlone—without equal.\nUnchanging—its transformations are eternal.\n\nIt moves in cycles without exhaustion,\npermeating Heaven and Earth,\nunscathed in the sun, uncorrupted in the shade,\npenetrating all without peril.\nIt can be the mother of the world.\nThe Dao/Way nurtures the vital essence of all things,\nas a mother nurtures her child.\n\nI do not know its name—\nso I call it the Dao/Way.\nI do not see its form—\nso I name it thus.\nSeeing all things arise from the Dao/Way,\nI name it the Dao/Way.\nForced to name it, I call it *Great*.\nI do not know its name—\nso I forcefully call it *Great*.\n\nLofty yet without summit,\nencompassing yet without bounds—\nthus it is *Great*.\nGreat is called *Fleeting*—\nnot like Heaven, always above,\nnot like Earth, always below.\nYet it departs, without fixed abode.\n\nFleeting is called *Distant*—\nits distance extends to the boundless,\nits qi permeating Heaven and Earth,\nunobstructed in its passage.\n\nDistant is called *Returning*—\nits vastness does not sever,\nbut returns within the human realm.\nThus, the Dao/Way is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nand the Sovereign is Great.\n\nThe Dao/Way is Great—\nencompassing Heaven and Earth,\ncontaining all without exclusion.\nHeaven is Great—\ncovering all without omission.\nEarth is Great—\nbearing all without burden.\nThe Sovereign is Great—\ncommanding all without opposition.\n\nWithin the Four Extremes, there are Four Great Ones,\nand the Sovereign is one of them.\n\nHumans model themselves after Earth—\nquiet, still, yielding, gentle—\nplanted, they yield grain;\ndug, they yield sweet springs.\nThey labor without complaint,\nperform deeds without expectation of reward.\n\nEarth models itself after Heaven—\nclear and undisturbed,\nbestowing without seeking return,\nnurturing all things without taking.\n\nHeaven models itself after the Dao/Way—\nthe Dao/Way acts without speech,\nits subtle qi flowing—\nall things arise naturally.\n\nThe Dao/Way models itself after *Nature*.\n\n**Chapter on Weighty Virtue** (Chapter 26)\nWeight is the root of lightness—\na ruler who does not hold weight is not revered,\na man who does not hold weight loses his spirit.\nGrass and trees, flowers and leaves are light—\nthus they wither and fall.\nRoots are heavy—\nthus they endure.\n\nStillness is the master of agitation—\na ruler who is not still loses his authority,\na man who is not still endangers himself.\nThe dragon is still—\nthus it transforms.\nThe tiger is agitated—\nthus it perishes young.\n\nTherefore, the Sage moves all day\nyet never departs from his stillness.\nHis carriage is his stillness.\nThe gentleman walks the Dao/Way\nyet never departs from his weighty composure.\n\nThough he enjoys palaces and concubines,\nhe remains detached.\nPalaces—meaning the royal halls.\nConcubines—meaning the inner chambers.\nDetached—meaning he avoids them.\n\nHow can the sovereign of ten thousand chariots\nbe so light in the world?\n*How*—meaning he laments the pain of his time.\nYet he conducts himself lightly before all.\n\nThe sovereign’s excess and dissipation\ndrain his vital essence.\nLightness leads to losing his ministers,\nagitation leads to losing his throne.\nAgitation leads to losing his spirit.\n\n**Chapter on Skillful Action** (Chapter 27)\nThe skilled practitioner leaves no trace.\n\nThe adept in the Dao/Way seeks it within himself,\nnever descending from his hall,\nnever stepping beyond his door—\nthus leaving no trace.\n\nThe adept in speech has no flaws or blemishes,\nfor he selects his words with care,\nand thus commits no errors before the world.\n\nThe adept in calculation needs no tally sticks,\nfor he adheres to the One without deviation,\nand his schemes are few—\nthus he knows without reckoning.\n\nThe adept in closure requires no locks or keys,\nfor he seals his passions and guards his spirit\nmore securely than doors with bolts.\n\nThe adept in binding needs no ropes or cords,\nfor he binds his heart—\nmore firmly than any tether.\n\nTherefore, the Sage is always adept at saving people,\nteaching them loyalty and filial piety\nto rescue their very lives.\nThus, he abandons no one;\nnobles and commoners each find their place.\n\nHe is always adept at saving things,\nharmonizing with the Four Seasons\nto rescue all creatures from harm.\nThus, he abandons nothing.\n\nThe Sage does not demean stone while honoring jade,\nregarding them as one.\nThis is called *clinging to clarity*.\n\nThe Sage is adept at saving both people and things—\nthis is called *clinging to the Great Dao/Way*.\n\nThus, the virtuous become teachers for the unvirtuous,\nfor those who act rightly are made the Sage’s guides for others.\n\nThe unvirtuous become resources for the virtuous—\n*resources*, meaning tools.\nEven when people act wrongly,\nthey may still be guided toward virtue,\nthus serving a purpose.\n\nTo dishonor one’s teacher\nis to have no aid.\nTo disregard one’s resource\nis to have nothing to employ.\nThough one may claim wisdom,\nsuch a person is deeply deluded.\nThis is called *the essential mystery*.\n\nTo grasp this Dao/Way is to know the subtle and essential.\n\n**Chapter on Returning to Simplicity** (Chapter 28)\nKnowing the masculine, he guards the feminine,\nand becomes the valley of the world.\n*The masculine*—meaning exalted status,\n*the feminine*—meaning humility.\nThough one knows his own exaltation,\nhe must guard his humility,\nabandoning the masculine’s rigidity\nand embracing the feminine’s gentleness—\nthus the world flows toward him,\nlike water gathering in deep valleys.\n\nTo become the valley of the world,\nhis virtue remains unbroken.\nHe returns to the infant.\nHe must return his mind to the simplicity of the infant,\nclumsy and unaware.\n\nKnowing the bright, he guards the dark,\nand becomes the model of the world.\n*The bright*—meaning clarity,\n*the dark*—meaning stillness.\nThough one knows his own clarity,\nhe must guard it with silence,\nas if in darkness, seeing nothing—\nthus he becomes the standard for the world,\nand his virtue remains unerring.\n\nTo become the model of the world,\nhis virtue never falters.\nHe returns to the boundless.\n\nKnowing honor, he guards disgrace,\nand becomes the valley of the world.\n*Honor*—meaning nobility,\n*disgrace*—meaning impurity.\nThough one knows his own nobility,\nhe must guard it with humility,\nas if stained—\nthus the world flows toward him,\nlike water entering deep valleys.\n\nTo become the valley of the world,\nhis virtue is complete.\n*Complete*—meaning settled.\nHe returns to simplicity.\n\nWhen simplicity disperses, it becomes tools.\nWhen the Dao disperses, it becomes spirit and clarity,\nbecoming the sun and moon,\ndividing into the Five Phases.\nThe Sage employs it,\nand it becomes officials and leaders.\nThus, great governance does not harm.\n\nTo govern the body, he employs the Dao\nto regulate passions,\nwithout harming the spirit.\n\n**Chapter on Non-Action** (Chapter 29)\nWhen one seeks to take the world by force,\nI see it as inevitable failure.\nThe Dao/Way abhors complexity and filth,\nhuman hearts abhor excess desire.\nThe world is a sacred vessel—\nit cannot be seized.\n\n*Vessel*—meaning essence.\nHumans are the sacred essence of the world.\nThe sacred essence prefers tranquility\nand cannot be governed by force.\n\nAction ruins it,\ngrasping loses it.\nForcing instruction breeds deceit.\n\nThus, some advance, some retreat,\nsome are warmed, some are chilled,\nsome are strong, some are weak,\nsome are secure, some are endangered.\n\nTherefore, the enlightened ruler cannot govern by force.\nThus, the Sage rejects excess,\nrejects extravagance,\nrejects extravagance.\n*Excess*—meaning gluttony for sounds and colors,\n*extravagance*—meaning attire, food, and dwellings,\n*extravagance*—meaning palaces and pavilions.\nAbandoning these three,\ndwelling in moderation,\npracticing non-action,\nthe world transforms itself.\n\n**Chapter on Frugal Military Strategy** (Chapter 30)\nTo assist a ruler with the Dao/Way\nis to have him govern without arms,\nconquering the world without force.\nHis actions return to him naturally,\nwithout blame.\n\nWhere his army passes,\nthorns and brambles grow.\nFor agriculture is neglected,\nfields left untended.\nAfter great armies,\nthere are always years of famine.\n\nThe **Heaven** responds with the *killing qi*, and thus harms the five grains.\nWhen the five grains are exhausted, it harms the people as well.\n\nThe virtuous act decisively, yet with restraint.\nThe virtuous wielders of arms—when they act decisively, they must dare to do so with restraint,\nnot seeking glory.\nThey do not dare to claim strength through conquest.\nThey do not seek the name of mighty armies through decisive yet arrogant actions.\nAct decisively yet do not boast—when one acts decisively, they must remain humble,\nnot prideful in their strength.\nAct decisively yet do not take credit—when one acts decisively, they must yield and not claim glory for themselves.\nAct decisively yet do not be arrogant—arrogance is deception.\nWhen one acts decisively, they must not deceive others with arrogance.\nAct decisively only when unavoidable—when unavoidable, they must do so with utmost sincerity,\nnot through coercion or desperate compulsion.\nAct decisively yet do not force—decisive action must not be seen as brute strength or impenetrable armor,\nto oppress others.\n\nWhen things flourish, they grow old—\nwhen grass and trees reach their peak, they wither and fall,\nwhen people reach their peak, they decline and age.\nThis means that strength cannot endure long.\nThis is called *not the Dao*—\nthose who wither and age sit and fail to follow the Dao.\nNot the Dao leads to early ruin.\nThose who do not follow the Dao die early.\n\n**Chapter on Laying Down Arms** (Chapter 31)\nFine arms are not auspicious implements—\n*auspicious* means *good*.\nArms are instruments that disturb the spirit,\ncloud the harmonious *qi*—\nthey are not good implements,\nand should not be adorned.\n\nSome things are naturally repugnant—\nwhen arms are used, harm is inevitable,\nso all things naturally abhor them.\nThus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\nThose who follow the Dao do not dwell in their lands.\n\nThe **gentleman** in peace values the left—\nvaluing the soft and yielding.\nIn war, they value the right—\nvaluing the strong and resolute.\nThis says that the Dao of arms is contrary to the Dao of the gentleman,\nand what they cherish is different.\n\nArms are not auspicious implements,\nnor are they the instruments of the gentleman—\nnot the implements the gentleman cherishes.\nOnly when unavoidable are they used—\nwhen facing decline or calamity,\nto protect the people,\nnot to plunder lands or covet wealth and treasures.\nVictory yet without glory—\neven if they achieve victory, they do not take pride in it.\n\nBut those who take pride in victory—\nthose who delight in killing—\nare those who revel in slaughtering others.\nThose who excel in achieving victory\nare those who are said to take joy in killing.\n\nHe who takes joy in killing\ncannot fulfill his ambitions in the world.\nFor a ruler who takes joy in killing,\nthis is why he cannot make his will prevail in the world.\n\nA sovereign who delights in killing\nmust necessarily control the lives of his people,\nand recklessly execute and slaughter them.\nThus, auspicious matters are honored on the left—\nthe left, the place of life.\nOminous matters are honored on the right—\nthe Dao of the dark governs death.\nThe subordinate general stands on the left—\nthe subordinate general is lowly and occupies the position of the bright.\nThe supreme general stands on the right—\nthe supreme general is exalted and occupies the rightful position,\nfor he governs death.\nThis is said in the context of funeral rites.\nThe supreme general resides on the right,\noverseeing funeral rites.\nFuneral rites are honored on the right,\nfor the dead are held in darkness.\nWhen the number of slain is great,\nthey mourn with sorrow and tears.\nWhen one’s own virtue is thin,\nhe cannot transform the people through the Dao,\nand thus harms the innocent.\nWhen victorious in battle,\nhe treats it as a funeral rite.\nIn ancient times, when victorious in battle,\nthe general would occupy the position of the funeral master,\ndressed in plain white garments and weeping.\nThe wise gentleman values virtue over arms,\nand when arms are unavoidable,\nhe punishes what is inauspicious,\nyet his heart does not rejoice in it,\ncomparing it to a funeral.\nKnowing that future generations will not cease from arms,\nhe mourns and grieves deeply.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Virtue of the Dao**\nThe Dao is constant and nameless.\nThe Dao can be dark and bright,\ncan relax and expand,\ncan preserve and perish—\nthus it has no constant name.\nThough simple and unadorned,\nthe Dao is vast, and the world dare not enslave it.\nThe Dao is simple yet subtle and formless,\nand the world dare not enslave those who embody it.\nIf lords and kings can uphold it,\nall things will come to serve of their own accord.\nIf lords and kings can uphold the Dao,\nall things will naturally submit and follow in virtue’s transformation.\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite,\nsweet dew descends—\nwhen the actions of lords and kings align with Heaven and Earth,\nHeaven bestows sweet dew and auspicious blessings.\nThe people need no command,\nyet all things are balanced.\nWhen Heaven’s sweet dew and auspicious blessings descend,\nno thing needs teaching or ordering,\nyet all things naturally adjust in harmony.\nThe Dao first gives rise to names—\nthe Dao, which is the Way,\ngives rise to named things, the myriad beings.\nThe Dao is nameless, yet it governs what is named;\nformless, yet it governs what is formed.\nOnce names exist,\nall named things have desires and emotions,\nrebelling against the Dao and departing from virtue,\nthus their bodies are destroyed and dishonored.\nHeaven will also come to know of it.\nIf a person can follow the Dao and cultivate virtue,\nHeaven will also come to know of it.\nKnowing of it,\nthis is why there is no peril.\nWhen Heaven knows of it,\nits divine clarity aids and protects,\nand no longer is there danger or peril.\nThe Dao in the world is like streams and valleys to the rivers and seas.\n\nThe Dao is vast and boundless,\nlike something submerged or floating,\nlike something present yet absent,\nseen yet not seen,\nspoken yet hard to distinguish.\n\nIts influence can be turned left or right.\nThe Dao can be applied left or right,\nadapting to all circumstances.\n\nAll things depend upon it to arise,\n*[shì]*, meaning they await the Dao to give birth.\nYet the Dao does not refuse or decline.\nThe Dao does not reject and cease.\n\nIts work accomplished, it does not claim ownership.\nThough the Dao possesses virtue,\nit does not name itself as such.\n\nIt nurtures all things yet does not lord over them.\nThough the Dao cherishes and sustains all things,\nit does not take as a ruler does.\n\nConstantly without desire,\nit may be called small.\nThe Dao conceals its traces and hides its name,\ncalmly acting without doing,\nseeming faint and insignificant.\n\nYet all things return to it without being ruled,\nall things return to the Dao to receive its *qi*,\nyet the Dao does not prohibit like a ruler.\n\nThus it may be called great.\nAll things come and go freely,\neach acting according to its own nature,\nso it may be called the greatest.\n\nTherefore, the sage never claims greatness,\nthe sage follows the Dao,\nconceals virtue and hides its name,\nnot seeking to fill itself with greatness.\n\nThus it can achieve true greatness.\nThe sage leads by embodying the Dao,\nacting without words yet transforming,\nall matters refined and ordered,\nthus it can achieve true greatness.\n\n**Chapter 35: Virtue of Benevolence**\nHold the great symbol,\nand the world will follow.\n*[zhí]*, meaning to uphold;\n*[xiàng]*, meaning the Dao.\nWhen the sage upholds the great Dao,\nthe world’s people turn their hearts and follow.\n\nOrder oneself,\nand Heaven grants divine clarity,\nmoving toward you.\nWhen the sage orders its own being,\nHeaven sends its divine light,\ncoming and going with you.\n\nComing yet not harming,\npeace and tranquility ensue.\nAll things follow yet are not injured,\nso the state becomes secure and attains great peace.\n\nOrdering oneself without harming divine clarity,\nthe body remains at ease and attains great longevity.\nDelight and allure,\npassing travelers stop.\n\n*[ĕr]*, meaning beauty;\n*[guòkè]*, meaning singularity.\nWhen a person finds beauty in the Dao,\nit abides in singularity.\nSingularity means to depart from excess and embrace emptiness,\nto dwell lightly as a passing traveler.\n\nWhen the Dao emerges from the mouth,\nit is faint and without taste.\nThe Dao enters and exits through the mouth in faintness,\nnot like the five flavors—\nsour, salty, sweet, bitter, and pungent.\n\nViewing it, one cannot see it fully.\n*[zú]*, meaning attainment.\nThe Dao is formless,\nnot like the five colors—\ngreen, yellow, red, white, and black,\nwhich can be fully attained by sight.\n\nListening to it, one cannot hear it fully.\nThe Dao is not like the five tones—\n*gōng, shāng, jiǎo, zhǐ, yǔ*,\nwhich can be fully attained by hearing.\n\nUsing it, it cannot be exhausted.\n*[jì]*, meaning completion;\nmeaning that when the Dao is used to govern the state,\nthe state becomes wealthy and its people flourish,\nwhen used to order oneself,\nlongevity extends—\nthere is no time of exhaustion.\n\n**Chapter 36: Subtle Clarity**\nTo prepare for contraction,\none must first fully expand;\n---\n\nFirst, expand it fully,\nso that its extravagance and excess may reach their height.\nWhen you wish to weaken it,\nyou must first make it strong;\nfirst strengthen it,\nso that it may meet with misfortune and harm.\n\nWhen you wish to discard it,\nyou must first elevate it;\nelevating it first,\nso that its arrogance and excess may reach peril.\nWhen you wish to take it away,\nyou must first give it.\nGiving it first,\nso that its prideful desires may be fully indulged.\n\nThis is called *Subtle Clarity*.\n\nThese four matters—\ntheir Dao is subtle,\nyet their effects are clear.\n\nThe soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.\nThe soft and weak endure long,\nwhile the hard and strong perish first.\n\nFish do not escape from the depths,\nbut when fish escape from the depths,\nit means they have left the hard for the soft,\nand cannot be recaptured.\n\nThe state’s sharpest tools\nshould not be shown to the people.\nSharp tools refer to *power*.\nThose who wield power in governing the state\nshould not reveal it to their attending ministers.\nThose who practice the Dao of self-cultivation\nshould not reveal it to those unworthy.\n\n**Chapter 37: Governing with Dao**\n\nThe Dao acts without action,\nyet nothing remains undone.\nThe Dao abides in non-action as its constant.\nIf lords and kings can uphold it,\nall things will transform of their own accord.\nThis means that if lords and kings uphold the Dao,\nall things will spontaneously manifest their effects for them.\n\nWhen transformation begins to stir,\nI will restrain it with the uncarved simplicity of the Nameless.\n*I* refers to the self.\nThe *Nameless* refers to the Dao.\nWhen all things manifest their effects for them,\nyet still desire to act with artifice and deceit,\nlords and kings must restrain them with virtue and Dao.\n\nThe uncarved simplicity of the Nameless\nwill then also not desire to act,\nand by not desiring, it remains tranquil.\nThis means that when lords and kings restrain with virtue and Dao,\nthe people will also not desire to act,\nso they must be transformed through the tranquil Way.\n\nThen the world will spontaneously align itself.\nThose who can do this—\nthe world will spontaneously align and settle.\n\n**Chapter 38: On Virtue**\n\nThe highest virtue is non-virtue.\nBy \"highest virtue,\" it refers to the sovereigns of the primordial age, whose virtue was supreme and nameless.\nTo say \"non-virtue\" means they did not govern through virtue but followed nature’s course, nurturing life and destiny without visible intervention.\nThus, they *had* virtue—\nfor their virtue harmonized with Heaven and Earth, blending with the flowing *qi*, allowing the people to thrive.\n\nThe lower virtue is not lost virtue.\nBy \"lower virtue,\" it refers to sovereigns with titles and posthumous names, whose virtue fell short of the highest.\nTo say \"not lost virtue\" means their virtue was visible, their deeds praiseworthy.\nThus, they *lack* virtue—\nbecause they bore names and titles.\n\nThe highest virtue does nothing.\nThis means adhering to the Dao’s tranquil stillness, making no alterations.\nYet it does nothing—\nmeaning it does not rely on names or titles.\n\nThe lower virtue acts.\nThis means issuing edicts and administering governance.\nYet it does so—\nmeaning it uses these deeds to claim titles for itself.\n\nThe highest benevolence acts.\nBy \"highest benevolence,\" it refers to sovereigns who practice benevolence, whose virtue is unmatched.\nTo say \"acts\" means they enact benevolent kindness.\nYet they do nothing—\nfor when their deeds are complete, they do not cling to them.\n\nThe highest righteousness acts.\nThis refers to righteousness in punishing harm.\nYet it does so—\nmeaning they act for personal gain, killing to assert power, taxing the people to sustain themselves.\n\nThe highest ritual acts.\nBy \"highest ritual,\" it refers to sovereigns whose rituals are unmatched.\nTo say \"acts\" means they establish ritual institutions and ceremonial order.\nYet none respond—\nfor ritual flourishes in form while substance decays, its excesses and deceits multiplying, every action straying from the Dao, making response impossible.\nThus, they raise their arms and force compliance—\nmeaning the burdensome rituals, unanswered, provoke resentment and strife, so they compel obedience by force.\n\nHence, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;\nwhen virtue is lost, benevolence appears;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness is enforced;\nwhen righteousness is lost, ritual is imposed.\nFor ritual is the thinnest layer of loyalty and sincerity—\nmeaning ritual abandons the root to adorn the branches, so uprightness dwindles while deceit proliferates.\n\nPrescience is the Dao’s superficial bloom, the beginning of folly.\nTo speak without knowing is prescience.\nThis is when people lose the Dao in truth but grasp its superficiality—\nthe first spark of folly and darkness among men.\n\nThus, the true sage abides in substance,\nby \"true sage,\" meaning the sovereign who embodies the Dao.\nTo \"abide in substance\" means to dwell in sincerity and simplicity.\nThey do not abide in superficiality—\nmeaning they do not indulge in worldly turmoil and excess.\nThey reside in truth—\nmeaning they uphold loyalty and sincerity.\nThey do not reside in superficiality—\nmeaning they do not prize empty words.\nThus, they discard the latter and embrace the former.\n\n**Chapter 39: The Law of the One**\n\nThose of old who attained the One—\n\"of old\" refers to the past; \"the One\" is non-action, the child of the Dao.\nHeaven attains the One and becomes clear,\nEarth attains the One and becomes tranquil—\nmeaning Heaven, through the One, manifests its luminous forms;\nEarth, through the One, remains steadfast and unshaken.\n\nThe spirit attains the One and becomes numinous—\nmeaning the spirit, through the One, transforms without effort.\nThe valleys attain the One and become full—\nmeaning the valleys, through the One, remain abundant without depletion.\nAll things attain the One and thrive—\nmeaning all things depend on the Dao for their existence.\nThe lords and kings attain the One to rectify the world—\nmeaning they, through the One, bring order to the realm.\n\nYet if they overreach—\n\"overreach\" is a warning—concerning the following six dangers:\nHeaven, without clarity, would fear rupture—\nmeaning Heaven must balance yin and yang, alternating day and night; if it clings only to stillness, it risks fracturing and losing its heavenly nature.\n\nEarth, without tranquility, would fear eruption—\nmeaning Earth must embrace elevation and depression, hardness and softness, the five phases; if it clings only to stillness, it risks upheaval and losing its earthly nature.\n\nThe spirit, without numinosity, would fear exhaustion—\nmeaning the spirit must cycle through kingship, decline, and decay; if it clings only to vitality, it risks stagnation and losing its divine essence.\n\nThe valleys, without fullness, would fear depletion—\nmeaning the valleys must cycle through abundance and scarcity; if they cling only to fullness, they risk drying up and losing their nourishing nature.\n\nAll things, without generation, would fear annihilation—\nmeaning all things must follow the natural cycles of birth and death; if they cling only to life, they risk extinction and losing their true form.\n\nThe lords and kings, without humility, would fear downfall—\nmeaning they must humble themselves, seek worthy counsel; if they cling only to exaltation, they risk ruin and losing their rule.\n\nThus, nobility must root itself in humility—\nmeaning if one seeks true elevation, they must ground it in lowliness.\nLike Yu and Shi tilling the fields, Shun molding by the river, the Duke of Zhou dwelling in humble halls—\nhighness must be built upon lowliness.\nFor if the foundation is not firm, the structure will inevitably collapse.\n\nHence, lords and kings call themselves \"lonely and few, unworthy of the harvest\"—\n\"lonely and few\" signifies solitude; \"unworthy of the harvest\" signifies they cannot be the hub around which all else revolves.\nIs this not the essence of rooting in humility?\nThey speak thus to enlighten others.\nAlas, it is but deceitful speech.\n\n「Thus, gathering countless chariot parts yields no chariot—\n*致* (zhi) here means \"to gather.\"\nIt speaks of how people gather chariot parts—\nfor the spokes, for the wheels, for the hub, for the axle—\nyet none can be called a \"chariot\" until they are assembled.\nThis illustrates how lords and kings, by not claiming exalted titles,\ncan thereby achieve true nobility.\n\nThey do not wish to be polished like jade,\nnor stark like stone.\n*碌碌* (luoluo) signifies scarcity;\n*落落* (luoluo) signifies abundance.\nJade is scarce, hence its value;\nstone is plentiful, hence its lowliness.\nIt speaks of how people should not seek to be prized like jade,\nnor despised like stone,\nbut rather dwell in moderation.\n\n**Dao/Way’s Movement (反者道之动)**\n*反* (fan) here means \"root\" or \"origin.\"\nThe root is what makes the Dao/Way move—\nmovement generates all things;\nto go against it is to perish.\nThe Dao/Way’s use is in weakness.\n\nThe soft and yielding are what the Dao/Way habitually employs,\nand thus they endure.\nAll things under heaven are born from what is present—\nthings arise from the forms and positions of heaven and earth,\nso it is said they are born from what is present.\nYet what is present is born from what is absent.\n\nHeaven and earth, divine and luminous,\nthe *蜎* (ying) flying, the *蠕* (ru) crawling—\nall arise from the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way is formless, hence it is said they are born from what is absent.\n\nThis speaks of how the root surpasses the flourish,\nthe weak surpass the strong,\nand humility surpasses fullness.\n\n**Hearing the Dao/Way (同异第四十一)**\nThe superior person hears the Dao/Way\nand strives diligently to practice it.\nThe middle person hears the Dao/Way\nand clings to it, yet falters—\nthey strive to cultivate themselves for long life,\nto govern their state for lasting peace,\nand take pleasure in its teachings.\nBut when they encounter wealth, desire, honor, or glory,\nthey are bewildered by their passions\nand thus lose it again.\nThe inferior person hears the Dao/Way\nand laughs at it.\nThe inferior are greedy, cruel, and filled with desires;\nthey see the Dao/Way’s softness and call it fearsome.\nThey see its plainness and call it vulgar.\nThus, they laugh at it.\n\nIf one does not laugh at it,\nit is not worthy to be called the Dao/Way.\nIf the Dao/Way is not laughed at by the inferior,\nit is not yet fully the Dao/Way.\nHence, I set forth these sayings:\n\nThe bright Dao/Way seems dim,\nthe advancing Dao/Way seems to retreat,\nthe smooth Dao/Way seems crooked.\nThe superior in virtue seems like a deep valley,\nthe great purity seems like a stain,\nthe vast virtue seems insufficient,\nthe established virtue seems hollow.\nThe truthful seem false,\nthe upright seem misaligned,\nthe great instrument takes long to mature,\nthe great sound is rare in voice,\nthe great image is formless,\nthe Dao/Way is hidden, nameless.\n\nOnly the Dao/Way\nis good at lending and completing.\n*成* (cheng) here means \"to fulfill.\"\nIt speaks of how the Dao/Way is good at bestowing upon people\ntheir vital *qi* and bringing them to completion.\n\n**The Transformations of the Dao/Way (道化第四十二)**\nThe Dao/Way first generates *一* (yi),\nthe primal unity.\n*一* (yi) generates *二* (er),\nthe duality of yin and yang.\n*二* (er) generates *三* (san),\nthe three *qi* of harmony, clarity, and turbidity,\nwhich divide into heaven, earth, and humanity.\n*三* (san) generates all things.\nHeaven and earth, humanity together generate all things.\n\nHeaven bestows, earth transforms,\nand humanity nurtures them.\nAll things bear yin and embrace yang,\nturning toward the sun as they revolve.\nThe *冲气* (chongqi) of harmony pervades them all—\nwithin all things lies the primal *qi*,\nand when harmonized and softened,\nit is like marrow in bones,\nor the void within grasses and trees.\nThe *qi* of harmony flows silently,\nand thus they attain longevity.\n\nWhat people detest\nis the \"lonely and few, unworthy of the harvest,\"\nyet lords and kings take it as their name.\n\"Lonely and few, unworthy of the harvest\"\nis an ill-omened title,\nyet lords and kings adopt it,\ndwelling in humility,\nembodying emptiness, harmony, and softness.\nThus, some things are diminished yet gain,\nsome are drawn yet cannot be held,\nsome are pushed yet return.\nSome gain yet are diminished.\n\nHe who raises himself too high invites collapse,\nhe who covets wealth and honor invites calamity.\nWhat people are taught\nis to abandon the weak for the strong,\nto abandon the soft for the hard.\nI also teach this—\nI teach people to abandon the strong for the weak,\nto abandon the hard for the soft.\n\nThe rigid and forceful\ndo not meet a natural death.\nThe rigid and forceful\ndo not believe in the mysterious and profound,\nthey betray morality,\ndo not follow the teachings,\nbut rely on power and strength.\nIt is said they do not meet a natural death—\nthey are cut off by heaven,\nslain by weapons,\nexecuted by law,\nand do not die by the full span of their years.\nI shall take them as my first lesson.\n\n**The Dao/Way’s Partial Use (偏用第四十三)**\nThe utmost softness under heaven\novercomes the utmost hardness under heaven.\nThe utmost softness is water,\nthe utmost hardness is metal and stone.\nWater can penetrate hardness,\nenter rigidity—\nnothing it cannot pass through.\nThere is nothing it cannot enter without gap.\n\nIt is said there is nothing it cannot enter—\nthis is the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way has no form or substance,\nand thus can move freely without obstruction,\npenetrating the divine and luminous,\nbenefiting all living things.\nThus, I know the benefits of *无为* (wuwei).\n\nI see how the Dao/Way’s *wuwei*\nyet all things transform and complete themselves—\nthus I know the benefits of *wuwei* for humanity.\n\n---\n\n**The Dao/Way’s Silent Instruction (不言之教)**\nBy law of the Dao/Way, that which is not spoken#11,\nthe teacher applies it to oneself.\n\nThe benefits of *wuwei* are such:\nby law of the Dao/Way’s *wuwei*,\ngoverning the body brings benefit to **spirit/qi**,\ngoverning the state brings benefit to all the people—\nwithout toil or vexation.\n\nFew under heaven can attain this.\n\nThe world, its ruler is humanity.\nIf few can attain the Dao/Way’s *wuwei*,\nthen *wuwei* governance is both of body and state.\n\n**Establishing Precepts (立戒第四十四)**\nWhich is more dear to you, name or body?\nIf name follows body, it must decline.\nWhich is more abundant, body or wealth?\nIf wealth is abundant, it harms the body.\nWhich is more painful, gain or loss?\nIf one clings to profit, one’s actions will falter.\n\nExcessive love brings great cost.\nExcessive love of beauty wastes **spirit/qi**,\nexcessive love of wealth invites calamity.\nWhat is loved is little, what is lost is much—\nthus it is said that great cost arises.\nExcessive hoarding brings great loss.\nThe living hoard in treasuries,\nthe dead hoard in tombs.\nThe living face fears of plunder and assault,\nthe dead face fears of desecration and neglect.\n\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace,\nthe contented one cuts off profit and desire—\nno disgrace befalls the body.\n\nKnowing restraint brings no peril,\nhe who knows when to stop must stop,\nthen wealth and profit do not weigh upon the body and mind,\nsensual pleasures do not disturb the ears and eyes—\nthus he remains throughout life unthreatened,\nable to endure.\n\nIf humanity can know to stop at contentment,\nthen fortune and blessings are within themselves.\nHe who governs his body does not weary **spirit/qi**,\nhe who governs his state does not trouble the people—\nthus he can endure long.\n\n**Abundant Virtue/Power (洪德第四十五)**\nGreat virtue/power, though complete, seems deficient.\nThis refers to a sovereign of great Dao/virtue/power:\nthough complete, he hides his name and renown,\nas if destroyed or incomplete.\nHis governance knows no exhaustion—\nwhen his heart is thus, there is no time when virtue/power is spent.\n\nGreat fullness seems empty.\nThis refers to a sovereign of great Dao/virtue/power, overflowing with abundance:\nthough full, he does not dare to be arrogant in his high rank,\nthough rich, he does not dare to be extravagant.\nHis governance knows no depletion—\nwhen his heart is thus, there is no time when virtue/power is exhausted.\n\nGreat rectitude seems bent.\nGreat rectitude refers to one who follows the Dao/Way’s laws and precepts with perfect uprightness.\nThough bent, he does not contend with the common folk,\nas if he could be bent and folded.\n\nGreat cleverness seems clumsy.\nGreat cleverness refers to one with many talents and skills.\nThough clumsy, he does not dare to show his abilities.\n\nGreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\nGreat eloquence refers to one whose wisdom is unquestionable.\nThough inarticulate, his speech is without words.\n\nExcessive vigor overcomes coldness—\n*vigor*, here, means extreme.\n\nSpring and summer, the **yang qi** is restless and swift above,\nall things flourish and grow vast.\nWhen it reaches its extreme, coldness follows—\ncoldness brings withering and scattering to ruin,\na warning that one must not be overly rigid and restless.\n\n**Calmness overcomes heat**—\nin autumn and winter, all things rest beneath the Yellow Springs.\nWhen it reaches its extreme, heat arises—\nheat is the source of life’s vitality.\n**Clarity and stillness** establish the **Dao/Way** as the standard for the world.\nIf one can be clear and still,\nthen one becomes the leader of the world,\nand holding to this standard knows no end.\n\n**Frugality** (the forty-sixth) —\nWhen the ruler follows the **Dao/Way**,\nhe uses **walking horses** to fertilize the fields;\n*fertilize*, here, means **cultivating the soil**.\nHe does not employ arms,\nbut uses **walking horses** to tend the farmlands.\nOne who governs himself **restrains his yang essence**,\nusing it to **fertilize his own body**.\n\nWhen the ruler does not follow the **Dao/Way**,\n**walking horses** breed in the suburbs.\nWarfare never ceases,\nand **walking horses** multiply in the borderlands,\nnever returning home.\nNo crime is greater than **excessive desire**,\nfor lustful indulgence.\nNo calamity is greater than **not knowing contentment**,\nfor the rich and noble cannot restrain themselves.\nNo fault is greater than **greed for gain**,\ndesiring wealth, influence, and profit.\nThus, **contentment’s root is contentment itself**—\n**true contentment** lies in guarding the **original essence**.\nAlways content,\nmeaning **without desire at all**.\n\n**Reflecting from afar** (the forty-seventh) —\nWithout leaving his door, he knows the world;\nthe sage does not need to leave his door to know the world,\nfor he understands it by knowing the **human body** through his own,\nand **human families** through his own.\nThus he perceives the world.\nWithout peering through windows, he beholds **Heaven’s Dao/Way**.\n**Heaven’s Dao/Way** and **human Dao/Way** are alike—\n**Heaven** and **humanity** are in harmony,\ntheir **refined qi** interpenetrating.\nWhen the ruler is clear and still,\n**Heaven’s qi** naturally aligns.\nWhen the ruler is excessive in desire,\n**Heaven’s qi** becomes troubled and murky.\n**Fortune, misfortune, benefit, and harm** all arise from within.\nThe farther he goes,\nthe less he knows.\nMeaning: when he leaves his own home to observe others,\nor his own body to observe others’,\nthe more distant his gaze,\nthe less he truly sees.\nThus the sage knows without traveling—\nthe sage neither ascends to **Heaven** nor descends into the depths,\nyet knows the world through his **heart**.\nHe names without seeing—\nwhen the ruler above values **Dao/Way**, those below value **virtue/power**;\nwhen the ruler above values **martial might**, those below value **strength**.\nThe sage discerns the small to grasp the great,\nand examines the inner to comprehend the outer.\n\n**Achievement through non-action** —\nThe sage acts without striving.\nWhen the ruler above favors **non-action** (*wuwei*),\nthose below have no need for exertion,\nfamilies are well-provided, and people are content—\nall things transform naturally.\n\n**Forgetting knowledge** (the forty-eighth) —\nTo study daily is to increase;\n*study*, here, refers to **governance, teaching, rituals, and music**.\nTo **increase daily** means **refining emotions, desires, and artificial adornments** grow ever more plentiful.\nTo follow the **Dao/Way** daily is to diminish.\nThe **Dao/Way** refers to **natural spontaneity**.\nTo **diminish daily** means **refining emotions, desires, and artificial adornments** are gradually worn away.\n**Diminish again and again**—\n*diminish*, here, means **eradicating desires**.\n**Again and again** refers to **gradually removing them**.\nUntil he reaches **non-action**—\nwhen he is **serene and simple**, like an infant,\n**creating nothing artificially**.\n**Non-action yet nothing remains undone**—\nwhen desires are severed and **virtue/power** aligns with the **Dao/Way**,\nhe accomplishes all without effort.\nTo **govern the world**, one must act with **non-interference**—\n*govern*, here, means **to rule**.\nRuling the world should be done with **non-interference**,\nnot with labor and disturbance.\nOnce **interference** arises,\none cannot rule the world.\nWhen one **loves interference**,\ngovernance grows troubled,\nand the people are restless—\nthus it is insufficient for ruling the world.\n\n**Entrusting to virtue** (the forty-ninth) —\nThe sage has no fixed heart,\nmeaning the sage **values transformation and adaptation**,\n**follows natural progression**,\nas if **without a settled intention**.\nHe takes the **hundred folk’s heart** as his own.\nWhatever benefits the **hundred folk**,\nhe follows accordingly.\nIf they are **good**, I **nurture their goodness**—\nwhen the **hundred folk** act well,\nthe sage **reinforces their virtue**.\nIf they are **not good**, I **also nurture their goodness**—\nthough the **hundred folk** may have those who are **not good**,\nthe sage **transforms them** until they become good.\n**Virtue is thus cultivated**.\nWhen the **hundred folk’s virtue** is transformed,\nthe sage **acts with goodness**.\n\nIf they are **faithful**, I **affirm their faithfulness**—\nwhen the **hundred folk** act faithfully,\nthe sage **reinforces their trustworthiness**.\nIf they are **not faithful**, I **also affirm their faithfulness**—\nthough the **hundred folk** may have those who are **not faithful**,\nthe sage **transforms them** until they become faithful.\n**Virtue is thus trustworthy**.\nWhen the **hundred folk’s virtue** is transformed,\nthe sage **acts with trust**.\n\nThe sage in the world is **solemn and cautious**—\nthe sage in the world is **solemn and cautious**,\nalways fearing **wealth and nobility**,\nnever daring to be **arrogant or extravagant**.\nHe **muddles the world’s heart**—\nmeaning the sage **clouds the hearts of the hundred folk**,\nas if they were **simple and unknowing**.\nThe **hundred folk** all **fix their ears and eyes** upon him—\n*fix*, here, means **to rely on**.\nThe **hundred folk** all **rely on his ears and eyes** as their **vision and hearing**.\nThe sage **treats them like infants**—\nthe sage **cherishes and nurtures the hundred folk** as if they were **babies or young children**,\n**cultivating them without expectation of reward**.\n\n**Valuing life** (the fiftieth) —\n**Birth and death** are intertwined,\n\n**Birth** refers to when **emotions and desires arise from the five viscera**—\nwhen the **hun** is steadfast and the **po** is tranquil, thus **life** emerges.\n\n**Death** refers to when **emotions and desires sink into the chest and abdomen**—\nwhen **spirit and essence** grow weary and confused, thus **death** comes.\n\nThere are **thirteen paths to life**,\nand **thirteen paths to death**—\nmeaning the **kinds of birth and death** each number thirteen,\nnamely the **nine orifices and four gates**.\n\nIn **life**, the eyes do not gaze wantonly,\nthe ears do not listen indiscriminately,\nthe nose does not indulge in foul or fragrant odors,\nthe mouth does not speak or taste recklessly,\nthe hands do not grasp at will,\nthe feet do not move arbitrarily,\nand the **essence** is not wasted.\n\nIn **death**, the opposite holds true.\n\n**Thirteen actions** lead a person to **death’s domain**—\nbut when one **seeks life**, those same actions, reversed, become **thirteen paths to death**.\n\nWhy is this?\n*—Why do these actions lead to death’s domain?*\nBecause **life’s excess** is too great.\n\nThe reason these actions lead to death’s domain\nis that **seeking life is too extreme**—\nit **contradicts the Dao** and **defies Heaven**,\nacting recklessly against oneself.\n\nNow, those who **master life-nurturing**—\n*—s摄 here means \"to nourish.\"*\n—**walk on land** and **avoid rhinoceros and tigers**,\nnaturally keeping far from harm.\n\nThey **enter battle** without armor or weapons,\n*—not favoring war or killing.*\nThe rhinoceros has no place to strike with its horn,\nthe tiger no place to strike with its claws,\nand weapons no place to strike with their blades.\n\nThose who **nurture life**—\ntigers and rhinoceros find no way to harm them,\nand blades have no means to strike.\n\nWhy is this?\n*—Why do tigers, rhinoceros, and weapons not harm them?*\nBecause they **avoid death’s domain**—\nbecause they **do not violate the thirteen paths to death**.\n*—Meaning the **spirit and clarity** protect them,\nand tigers, rhinoceros, and weapons dare not harm.*\n\n**Virtue-Nurturing (the fifty-first)**—\nThe **Dao** gives birth to **virtue**,\n\nThe **Dao** gives birth to myriad things.\n**Virtue** nurtures them—**virtue** is singular.\nThe singular **Dao** distributes **qi** to all,\nand **virtue** nourishes and sustains them.\nIt shapes their forms—\nthe singular **Dao** establishes shapes and likenesses for all things.\nIt forms their conditions—\nthe singular **Dao** creates the forces of cold and heat to bring them to fulfillment.\nThus, all things without fail revere the **Dao** and hold **virtue** in high esteem.\nWhatever **Dao** and **virtue** accomplish,\nall things respond with awe and reverence.\nThe **Dao’s** grandeur, **virtue’s** nobility—\nno summons is made, yet they ever act naturally.\nThe **Dao** does not call upon myriad things,\nyet they always respond naturally, like the echo of a sound.\nHence, the **Dao** gives birth to them,\n**virtue** nurtures them,\nlengthens and fosters them,\nfulfills and matures them,\ncovers and protects them.\nThe **Dao** does not merely give birth to myriad things—\nit also lengthens, nurtures, fulfills, matures,\nand covers to preserve their nature and life.\nWhen a ruler governs a state or cultivates oneself,\none should act likewise.\nTo give birth without possession—\nthe **Dao** gives birth to myriad things,\nyet does not claim ownership for its own use.\nTo act without reliance—\nthe **Dao’s** deeds are not done to demand reward.\nTo lengthen without slaughter—\nthe **Dao** lengthens and nurtures myriad things,\nyet does not slaughter or harm for its own gain.\nThis is called **Mysterious Virtue**.\nThe **Dao’s** actions are **en** and **virtue**,\nyet their mystery is dark and unseen.\n—**Returning to the Root (the fifty-second)**\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nand that beginning is the **Dao**.\nThe **Dao** is called the \"mother of the world.\"\nSince one knows its mother,\none must also know its child;\nthe child is singular.\nHaving known the **Dao**,\none must also guard it.\nHaving known the singular,\none must also guard the **Dao**,\nreturning to non-action.\nThus, one’s life is not endangered.\nOne’s body does not perish.\nClose its **dui**—\n**Dui**, the eyes.\nDo not gaze recklessly.\nShut its **men**—\n**Men**, the mouth.\nDo not speak recklessly.\nThen, one’s life is not labored.\nOpen its **dui**—\nopen the eyes,\nto discern desires.\nFulfill its affairs—\n**Jì**, to benefit.\nBenefit the desires.\nThen, one’s life is not in peril.\nCalamity and chaos arise.\nTo see the small is called **clarity**—\nwhen sprouts first appear, unseen,\ncalamity and chaos have not yet manifested,\nyet one alone discerns them—this is **clarity**.\nTo guard the soft is called **strength**—\nto guard softness and weakness is to strengthen greatness.\nTo use its light—\nto employ the eyes’ light outward,\nto discern the world’s benefits and harms.\nThen, return to its **clarity**—\nmeaning to restore the light inward,\nso that the **spirit** does not leak away.\nNo calamity befalls the body—\nby inwardly preserving the **spirit**,\none avoids losses.\nThis is

paths.\nCrooked paths—unrighteous, not upright or just—\nthough the great Dao is most plain and easy,\nthe people prefer to follow these crooked paths.\n\nThe court is most extravagant,\nwith towering pavilions and grand halls,\npalaces and chambers adorned.\nFields lie most untended,\nagriculture neglected,\nplowing and tilling forsaken while seasons pass.\nGranaries lie most empty,\ngrains spoiled and wasted,\nthe nation lacks provision.\n\nThey adorn themselves in fine embroidery,\npursue ornate pretense,\nvalue outward splendor.\nThey wear sharp blades,\npraise strength and vigor,\npursue martial prowess and wasteful excess.\nThey glut themselves with food and drink,\nwealth overflowing,\ndesires insatiable,\nyet never content—\nthis is called **deceptive

come,\nfamilies may crumble,\nand kin may perish along with them.\n**Deceptive display** is not the Dao, is it?\n\nIf a ruler acts thus,\nthis is not the Dao.\nThe words *\"is it not?\"* are an expression of lament.\n\n—**Habitual Practice (the fifty-fourth)**\n\n**Established virtue does not falter**,\n*Established*—to stand firm.\nVirtue established through the Dao in one’s person and nation\ncannot be shaken or uprooted.\n\n**Embraced virtue does not depart**,\nVirtue embraced through the Dao in spirit and qi\nwill never be abandoned or released.\n\nTheir descendants’ sacrifices will never cease.\nIf a person’s descendants practice the Dao thus,\nthey achieve **long life without death**,\nenduring through generations,\ntheir ancestral temples never without offerings.\n\nPracticed in the person,\nits **virtue/power** becomes true;\nPracticed in the person, the Dao\nnurtures **qi** and preserves the **spirit**,\nextending life and prolonging years.\nIf its **virtue/power** is such,\nthen one becomes a **True Person**.\n\nPracticed in the family,\nits **virtue/power** overflows;\nPracticed in the family, the Dao\nbrings forth a father’s tenderness and a son’s filial piety,\na brother’s kindness and a younger sibling’s obedience,\na husband’s trust and a wife’s rectitude.\nIf its **virtue/power** is such,\nthen blessings abound for future

foolish and ignorant.\nIf its **virtue/power** is such,\nthen none are left uncovered by its influence.\n\nPracticed in the state,\nits **virtue/power** becomes abundant;\nPracticed in the state, the

**virtue/power** is such,\nthen its blessings are plentiful.\n\nPracticed throughout the world,\nits **virtue/power** becomes universal.\nA ruler who practices the Dao throughout the world\nacts without speaking, governs without teaching,\nand the people respond as shadows follow their forms.\nIf its **virtue/power** is such,\nthen it may be called **universal and broad**.\n\nThus, observing

throat does not grow hoarse,\nthe utmost **harmony**.\nAn infant, from morning till evening,\ncries without ceasing,\nits voice unchanging—\nthis is due to the abundance of **harmonious qi**.\n\nTo know **harmony** is to know the **constant Dao**,\n*Constant*—ever-present, unchanging.\nIf a person knows the **harmonious qi**’s softness and benefit,\nthen they understand the Dao’s constancy.\n\nTo know the **constant Dao** is to know **clarity**,\n*Clarity*—enlightenment, insight.\nIf a person knows and follows the Dao’s constancy,\nthen day by day they attain **clarity** in its mysteries.\n\n**Beneficial life** is called **auspicious**,\n*Auspicious*—the Dao’s blessing.\nSpeaking of life that grows evermore,\nday by day expanding and strengthening.\nThe heart directs **qi**—this is called **strength**.\nIf the heart is focused, gentle, and harmonious,\n**qi** and **spirit** are firmly rooted within,\nso the form is soft.\nBut if the heart instead allows **false desires** to act,\nthen **harmonious qi** departs from the center,\nand the form grows evermore **rigid and strong**.\n\n—**Mysterious Virtue (the fifty-sixth)**\n\nThings grow strong then age,\nthis is called **not the Dao**.\nWhen all things reach their peak of vigor,\nthey wither and grow old—\nold, they cannot attain the Dao.\n\n**Not the Dao** leads to early decline.\nThose who do not attain the Dao\ndie young.\n\nThe wise do not speak,\nthe wise value **practicing the Dao** over words.\nThe talkative lack wisdom,\nmany words bring many troubles—\nfour horses cannot outrun the tongue.\n\nBlock its **mouth**,\nclose its **gate**,\n*Block*—to stop at the source.\n*Close*—to shut the door.\nTo **block** and **close** is to sever its origin.\n\nDull its sharpness,\nwhen desires are keen,\none should reflect on the Dao’s **non-action** to blunt them.\n\nLoosen its tangles,\n*tangles*—knots of grudges that never unwind.\nOne should reflect on the Dao’s **simplicity** to unravel them.\n\nHarmonize its brightness,\nthough one may have solitary insight,\none should harmonize it to prevent dazzlement.\nEqualize its dust,\none should not distinguish oneself.\nThis is called **mysterious unity**.\n*Mysterious*—heavenly, profound.\nIf a person can act thus,\nthis is called **aligning with Heaven’s Dao**.\n\nThus, it cannot be **close**,\nnot delighting in honor and glory,\nyet standing firm in sorrow.\nNor can it be **distant**;\n*Distant*—detached, estranged.\nWith **calm intent** and **no desires**,\none bears no grudges against others.\n\nThe Way cannot be grasped for **gain**—\nthe body does not crave wealth and rank,\nthe palate does not lust after the five flavors.\n\nNor can it be grasped for **harm**—\nit does not contend with the greedy for profit,\nnor does it vie with the bold for strength.\n\nIt cannot be made **exalted**—\nit does not serve as a ruler in chaotic times,\nnor does it occupy a position under a tyrannical lord.\n\nNor can it be made **lowly**—\nit does not grow arrogant through power,\nnor does it bow its will in defeat.\n\nThus, it is **noble beyond the world**.\nIts virtue is such that\nkings cannot make it their subject,\nlords cannot bend it to their will.\nIt floats with the world, rising and falling,\npreserving itself while avoiding harm—\nthus, it is **noble beyond the world**.\n\nTo govern the realm with **rectitude**—\n*rectitude*, the utmost.\nHeaven appoints those of upright conduct\nto rule with perfect governance.\n\nTo wage war with **strategy**—\n*strategy*, deceit.\nHeaven appoints those skilled in guile\nto command the armies.\n\nTo seize the world through **non-action**—\nHeaven entrusts those who act with effortless ease\nto rule the world as its sovereign.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this—\n*this*, the present.\nLaozi said:\nHow do I know Heaven’s intent is so?\nBy what is seen today.\n\n**Pure Wind**, the Fifty-Seventh.\n\nThe world abounds in taboos and prohibitions,\nyet the people grow ever poorer.\nThe world speaks of the sovereign.\nTaboos are restrictions and bans.\nToo many decrees breed deceit,\ntoo many prohibitions spawn guile below—\nthus, mutual harm and poverty arise.\n\nThe people multiply clever tools,\nand the state grows ever more confused.\nClever tools are *power* and influence.\nWhen the people wield too much power,\nthose who watch grow dazzled by sight,\nthose who listen grow bewildered by sound—\nsuperior and inferior grow estranged,\nand thus the state falls into chaos.\n\nThe people multiply in skill and artifice,\nand strange adornments flourish.\nThe people speak of the ruler and the great lords.\nMultiplying in skill means carving palaces and halls,\nengraving robes and adornments.\nStrange adornments grow ever more extravagant—\nthose below emulate those above,\ndecorating with gold and jade,\nembroidering with silk and dyes,\never more excessive each day.\n\nFine and desirable things grow ever more prominent,\nand thieves and robbers multiply.\nFine and desirable things are luxuries.\nWhen luxuries flourish and are displayed openly,\nfarming is neglected,\nhunger and cold draw near—\nthus, thieves and robbers multiply.\n\nTherefore, the Sage says:\n*\"I act with non-action, and the people transform themselves.*\nThe Sage speaks: *I cultivate the Dao and align with Heaven,\nmaking no alterations or innovations,\nyet the people transform themselves naturally.*\n\n*I love stillness, and the people become upright.*\nThe Sage speaks: *I cherish tranquility,\nspeaking not, teaching not,\nyet the people all become loyal and true.*\n\n*I engage in no affairs, and the people grow rich.*\nWithout forced labor or conscription,\nthe people settle into their work—\nthus, they all grow rich.\n\n*I desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity.*\nI constantly desire nothing,\nrejecting ornamentation and finery,\nwearing modest attire—\nthe people follow my simplicity.\n\n*I

growing weary and depleted day by day.\n\nCalamity! It is the foundation of fortune.\n*Foundation* means *origin*.\nWhen fortune arises from calamity,\nthose who encounter calamity repent their errors,\nblame themselves,\nand cultivate virtuous conduct along the Dao—\nthen calamity departs and fortune arrives.\n\nFortune! It is the seedbed of calamity.\nCalamity lies hidden within fortune.\nWhen one obtains fortune and becomes arrogant and licentious,\nfortune departs and calamity arrives.\n\nWho knows its limits?\nCalamity and fortune generate each other—\nwho can know their ultimate end?\n\nWhen the ruler lacks rectitude,\n*lack* means *not*.\nIt means the ruler does not rectify himself—\nthen the state will perish.\n\nRectitude returns as deceit.\n*Deceit* means *craftiness*.\nWhen the ruler lacks rectitude,\neven rectitude transforms beneath him into craftiness.\n\nVirtue returns as hypocrisy.\nVirtuous men all transform above into hypocritical omens.\n\nThe people’s confusion is long-standing.\nIt speaks of the ruler’s delusion and loss of rectitude\nhaving endured for many days.\n\nThus the Sage is square yet does not cut,\nThe Sage practices rectitude to guide the people,\nnot to sever them.\n\nHe is frugal yet does not harm,\nThe Sage’s frugality is pure,\nseeking to transform the people,\nnot to injure them.\nYet now it is not so—\nrectifying oneself to harm others.\n\nHe is upright yet does not flaunt,\n*Flaunt* means *proclaim*.\nThough the Sage is upright,\nhe bends himself to others,\nnot proclaiming himself.\n\nHe shines yet does not dazzle.\nThough the Sage possesses singular insight,\nhe remains as if dim,\nnot dazzling others with brilliance.\n\n**Guarding the Dao, the Fifty-Ninth**\n**Govern the People**\nThe ruler who governs the people\nshould serve the Dao of Heaven,\nfollowing the Four Seasons.\n\nNothing surpasses frugality.\n*Frugality* means *love*.\nThe ruler who governs the state must love the people’s resources,\nnot indulging in extravagance.\nThe ruler who governs himself must love his vital essence,\nnot indulging in dissipation.\n\nOnly through frugality\ndoes one attain early mastery.\n*Early* means *prior*.\n*Mastery* means *attainment*.\nTo love the people’s resources and vital essence alone\nis to first attain the Dao of Heaven.\n\nEarly mastery is called accumulating virtue.\nTo first attain the Dao of Heaven\nis to accumulate virtue within oneself.\nAccumulating virtue means nothing remains unconquered.\n*Conquer* means *overcome*.\nTo accumulate virtue within oneself\nis to overcome all.\nTo overcome all means none know its limits.\nTo overcome all without limits\nis to possess the state.\nTo possess the state without limits\nis to endure long.\nThe state and the body are the same.\n*Mother* refers to the Dao.\nIf one preserves the Dao within the body,\nso that vital essence is not exhausted\nand the Five Spirits are not tormented,\nthen one may endure long.\n\nThis is called deep roots and firm foundations.\nIf one takes *qi* as root and essence as foundation,\nlike a tree—if roots are not deep, it will be uprooted;\nif the foundation is not firm, it will fall—\nit speaks of deeply guarding one’s *qi*\nand firmly preserving one’s essence,\nso that none may leak away.\n\nThis is the Dao of longevity and enduring vision.\nThose with deep roots and firm foundations\nembody the Dao of longevity and enduring vision.\n\n「Chapter Four of the *Zhuang* of the *Dao De Jing*: Master Hu Shang’s Commentary\n\n**Section 60: Governing a Great State**\n\nTo govern a great state as one would cook a small fish—\n*Fish* refers to the people. When cooking a small fish,\none does not remove its entrails,\ndoes not strip its scales,\ndoes not dare to prod it,\nfor fear it will spoil.\n\nIf governance is burdensome, the people will fall into chaos;\nIf self-cultivation is burdensome, the vital essence will scatter.\n\nTo apply the Dao to the world,\nits spirits will not act with malevolence.\n\nTo govern the world with the *Dao* and *virtue* in one’s station,\nthen the spirits will not dare to confront one’s *spirit* (shén) and harm the people#1.\n\nIt is not their inherent *spirit* (shén) that harms people—\nNor does the Sage harm people.\n\nOnly those lacking *Dao* and *virtue* can harm people.\nWhen the Sage holds office,\nthey dare not harm people,\nthus the spirits do not dare interfere with humanity.\n\nWhen two do not harm each other,\nthe people are preserved in the *Yang*,\nthe spirits are preserved in the *Yin*,\nhumanity’s life and nature are kept whole,\nthe spirits preserve their own *spirit* (shén).\nThus, they return to their proper exchange.\n\n**Section 61: Humble Virtue**\n\nA great state is like the flow of water below—」\n\n「To govern a great state as the rivers and seas flow downward,\nit does not resist the smallest currents.\nThe world’s convergence rests in great states,\nwhere the world’s people gather and assemble.\n\nThe world’s *yin*—\n*Yin* is the category of the receptive.\nSoft, humble, yielding, yet not aggressive.\n*Yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,\nfor the female bends beneath the male,\n*yin* triumphs over *yang*#2,\nby remaining tranquil and never seeking first.\n\nTo be still is to be lowly.\nThe *Dao* of *yin* brings stability.\nThus, when a great state humbles itself before small states,\nit takes them;\nwhen it remains humble and yielding,\nit keeps them.\nWhen a small state humbles itself before a great state,\nit is gathered under it.\nThis shows that states, great or small,\nif they grasp humility and nurture others,\nwill never err.\n\nThus, sometimes one humbles to take,\nsometimes to gather.\nTo humble means for the great state to yield to the small,\nand for the small state to yield to the great,\neach taking what is rightfully theirs.\nThe great state seeks only to encompass and nurture others.\nIf the great state does not lose its humility,\nit will swallow and tend to the small states.\nThe small state seeks only to serve others,\nto become their subjects and servants.\nWhen both obtain what they desire,\nthe greater should indeed humble itself.\nThe great state and the small state each seek what they desire,\nbut the great state should especially humble itself.\n\n**Section 62: The Way**\n\nThe *Dao* is the hidden essence of all things—\n*Essence*, meaning what is stored within.\nThe *Dao* as the hidden storehouse of all things,\ncontains all without exclusion.\n\nThe treasure of the virtuous,\nthe virtuous use the *Dao* as their personal treasure,\ndaring not to defy it.\nThe refuge of the unvirtuous,\nthe *Dao* is the unvirtuous’ support and reliance.\nEven in calamity or urgency,\nthey may yet know to repent, humble, and yield.\n\nFine words can be sold—\nFine words can be sold: in trade, one exchanges and withdraws,\nbut does not persist in selling virtuous speech or sweet words.\nThe buyer desires swift acquisition,\nthe seller desires swift sale.\nNoble conduct can be bestowed upon others.\n*Bestow*, meaning to distinguish.\nWhen a person’s conduct is noble and distinguished,\nit is not yet sufficient to honor the *Dao*.\nWhat should one discard of those who are unvirtuous?\nEven the unvirtuous should be transformed by the *Dao*.\nBefore the Three Sovereigns, there were no abandoned people—\ntheir virtue and transformation were pure.\nThus, when establishing a Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers,\nit is to teach and transform the unvirtuous.\nEven if one presents a jade tablet before four horses,\nit is not as good as sitting and offering this *Dao*.\nEven if one presents fine jade with four horses,\nit is not as good as sitting and offering this *Dao*.\nWhy did the ancients value this *Dao* so highly?\nWhy not seek it daily to obtain it?\nThe ancients valued this *Dao* not by daily distant journeys to seek it,\nbut by finding it close within oneself.\nCan it free one from guilt?\n*Guilt* refers to those in chaotic times,\nunder tyrannical rulers who unjustly mete out punishment—\npracticing the *Dao* can dissolve death’s peril,\nsaving one from the masses.\nThus, it is held in highest esteem by the world.\n\nThe *Dao* and *virtue* are profound and far-reaching,\ncovering and aiding all without exception,\npreserving the self and governing the state,\nserene and effortless—\nthus, it can be held in highest esteem by the world.\n\n**Section 63: The Beginning of Grace**\n\nTo act without action,」\n\n「因成修故，无所改作。\nTo act in accordance with what is already formed, without alteration or fabrication.\n\n事无事，\n*Qi* without

small.\n\n天下难事必作於易，\nthe most difficult tasks must be undertaken when they are still easy;\n天下大事必作於细，\nthe greatest undertakings must begin with the slightest efforts.\n\n是以大人终不为大，\nthus, the great

to teach the people,\n使质朴不诈伪。\nso they remain plain and unadulterated.\n\n民之难治，\nThe people are difficult to govern—\n以其智多。\nbecause their cleverness is excessive.\n\n民之不可治理者，\nThe people who cannot be governed—\n以其智太多，\nbecause their cleverness is too great,\n必为巧伪。\nthey will inevitably resort to artifice and deceit.\n\n以智治国，国之贼；\nTo govern the state with cleverness is to be its thief—\n使智惠之人理国之政事，\nwhen clever and cunning individuals manage state affairs,\n必远道德，\nthey will inevitably drift from *Dao* and *virtue*,\n妄作祸福，\nrecklessly creating both blessings and misfortunes,\n而为国之贼也。\nand thus become thieves to the state.\n\n不以智治国，国之福。\nTo not govern the state with cleverness is its blessing—\n不使智惠之人治国之政事，\nwhen one does not allow clever and cunning individuals to manage state affairs,\n则民守正直，\nthe people uphold sincerity,\n不为邪饰，\nthey do not engage in deceitful adornment,\n上下相亲，\nsuperior and inferior are harmonious,\n君臣同力，\nruler and subjects work in concert—\n故为国之福也。\nthus, it is a blessing for the state.\n\n知此两者，亦楷式。\nTo know these two principles is to grasp the model—\n两者谓智不智也。\nthese two refer to the use and non-use of cleverness.\n\n常能知智者贼，不智者福，\nTo always recognize that cleverness is a thief and simplicity a blessing—\n是治身治国之法式也。\nthis is the method for governing oneself and the state.\n\n常知楷式，\nTo always know the model—\n是谓玄德。\nis called *xuan* (mysterious) *virtue*.\n\n玄，天也。\n*Xuan* is the *Dao* of heaven.\n\n能知治身治国之法式，\nTo know the methods of governing oneself and the state—\n是谓与天同德也。\nis to be in accord with the *virtue* of heaven.\n\n玄德深矣远矣，\nThis *xuan* *virtue* is profound and distant—\n玄德之人深不可测，\nthose with *xuan* *virtue* are deep beyond measure,\n远不可极也。\nand far beyond reach.\n\n与物反矣，\nThey go against the nature of things—\n玄德之人与万物反异，\nthose with *xuan* *virtue* are contrary to all things,\n万物欲益己，\nfor all things seek to benefit themselves,\n玄德欲施与人也。\nwhile *xuan* *virtue* seeks to give to others.\n\n然后乃至大顺。\nOnly then do they attain great harmony—\n玄德与万物反异，\nfor *xuan* *virtue* is contrary to all things,\n故能至大顺。\nthus, they reach great harmony.\n\n大顺者，天理也。\nGreat harmony is the *Dao* of heaven.\n\n后己第六十六\n**Chapter 66: The Sage Comes After Others**\n\n江海所以能为百谷王者，\nThe rivers and seas are able to be the sovereigns of all the valleys—\n以其善下之，\nbecause they are good at being lowly—\n江海以卑下，\nthe rivers and seas are humble and lowly,\n故众流归之，\nthus, all streams flow to them,\n若民归就於王也。\nas people naturally gather to their ruler.\n\n故能为百谷王。\nThus, they are sovereigns of all the valleys.\n\n直以就下，\nStraightforwardly, they are lowly—\n故能为百谷王。」\nthus, they are able to be sovereigns of all the valleys.\n\n**Chapter 67: The Three Treasures**\n\nThus, the Sage desires to be above the people—\nto be above them in position—\nyet must speak humbly to them;\nfollowing the rivers and seas,\ndwelling in modesty and humility.\nTo lead the people—\nto be before them in action—\nhe must place himself behind them in deed.\nHe serves others before himself.\n\nTherefore, the Sage, though above the people,\ndoes not weigh them down;\nthough he is their sovereign,\nhe does not oppress them with his exalted status,\nso the people revere him without feeling burdened.\nHe stands before them without harming them;\nthough he leads, he does not blind them with his brilliance,\nso the people love him as they would their parents,\nwith no thought of harm.\nThus, all under heaven joyfully promote him without tiring.\nThe Sage’s kindness is profound, his love vast—\nhe views the people as his own children—\nso all under heaven willingly advance him as their leader,\nnever weary of it.\nBecause he does not contend,\nall under heaven never tire of the Sage’s rule,\nfor he does not compete with others for precedence.\nThus, none can contend with him.\nMen all contend in action,\nbut none contend in non-action.\n\n**Chapter 68: Aligning with Heaven**\n\nAll under heaven call me great,\nyet I seem unworthy.\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"All under heaven call me virtuous and great,\nyet I feign foolishness and seem unworthy.\nOnly because I am truly great\ndo I seem unworthy.\nHe who boasts of his great virtue\nbrings harm to himself,\nso I feign foolishness and seem unworthy.\nI make no distinctions,\ntake no sides,\ndo not demean others while elevating myself.\nIf I were skilled for long,\nskill would mean cleverness and cleverness is not the way of the noble.\nThe clever are like petty men,\nnot the virtuous.\nI possess three treasures;\nI hold and cherish them:\nFirst, *ci*—\nloving the people as my own children.\nSecond, *jian*—\ntaxing as if taking from oneself.\nThird, not daring to lead all under heaven.\nI practice humility and retreat,\nnever initiating action.\nBecause of *ci*, I am courageous;\nfirst with benevolence, then with loyalty and filial piety.\nBecause of *jian*, I am expansive;\nthe Son of Heaven’s own frugality\nmakes the people’s daily lives abundant.\nBecause I do not dare lead all under heaven,\nI am able to become the leader of those who follow the *Dao*.\nTo be the leader of those who follow the *Dao*—\nthis is to be the Sage.\nNow, they abandon *ci* and courage,\nabandon *jian* and abundance,\nabandon humility and seek precedence—\nthis is the path of death.\nHe who acts thus\nmoves ever closer to ruin.\n*Ci* in war brings victory,\nin defense brings security.\nThe benevolent and kind\nwin the people’s devotion,\ntheir hearts and minds united,\nso in war they conquer the enemy,\nin defense they stand firm.\nHeaven aids them,\nshielding them with goodness and kindness.\nHeaven aids the virtuous,\nendowing them with benevolence and kindness\nto help themselves.\"\n\n**Chapter 69: Mysterious Application**\n\n**Chapter 70: Knowing**\n\nThe *Laozi*’s words are easy to know,\neasy to practice.\n\n「The *Laozi* says: My words are few yet easy to know,\nsimple yet easy to practice.\nYet none under heaven can truly know them,\nnone can truly practice them.\nPeople do not love softness and weakness,\nbut love strength and vigor.\nWords have their source,\naffairs have their rulers.\nWhat I say has its root and origin,\naffairs have their lords and subjects.\nThose who do not understand this\nare not without my virtue—\ntheir hearts oppose mine.\n\nOnly the unknowing\nare thus unable to know me.\nFor it is the unknowing of the world\nthat renders my *Dao* and virtue obscure,\nthat they do not see them outwardly.\nI penetrate the subtle and reach the profound mysteries,\nso the unknowing remain unknowing.\nFew know me,\nso I am honored by those who follow me.\nFew, indeed, are those who know me,\nso I am cherished by those who understand the *Dao*.\nThus, the Sage wears coarse robes while harboring precious *qi*.\nWearing coarse robes means he is slighted outwardly,\nharboring precious *qi* means he is rich inwardly.\nHe conceals his treasure and virtue,\nnot displaying them to the world.\n\n**Chapter 71: Knowing Illness**\n\nTo know the unknown is supreme;\nto know that one knows and yet speak of the unknown—\nthis is the supreme *virtue*.\nTo not know yet claim to know—\nthis is an illness.\nTo know that one knows and yet speak of the unknown—\nthis is the illness of *virtue*.\n\nOnly the sickly are thus unable to be sick.\nThe Sage does not suffer from this arrogance of knowledge,\nfor he grieves that others do.\nThe Sage is not sick,\nfor he knows sickness—\nthus he is not sick.\nHe pities others because of this,\nso he does not fall ill himself.\n\nIt is said that the Sage harbors comprehensive knowledge,\nyet presents it as unknown,\nso that all under heaven may remain simple and upright,\neach guarding their pure nature.\n\nThe petty do not understand this intent,\nyet presumptuously act with the arrogance of knowledge\nto make themselves known.\nThey harm their *spirit* inwardly,\nshorten their lifespan and waste their years.\n\n**Chapter 72: Loving Oneself**\n\nIf the people do not fear *threat*,\nthen great *threat* will come.\n*Threat* is harm.\nIf people do not fear small harm,\nthen great harm will come—\neven fearing death itself.\n\nThose who fear should nurture their *spirit*,\nalign with Heaven and follow Earth.\nThey should not narrow their dwelling place—\nmeaning the heart houses the *spirit*,\nand it must always be calm and gentle,\nnever tight or constricted.\nThey should not weary of their source of life—\nfor people live because they possess *spirit*,\nleaning on the void, delighting in stillness and purity.\nIf their diet is unregulated,\nif they indulge in desires and lusts,\nif their minds are filled with depravity,\nthese actions will cut short their lives and scatter their *spirit*.\n\nOnly those who do not weary\nare thus not wearied.\nOnly those who truly do not weary of their *spirit*\ncan wash away the filth of their hearts,\nremain tranquil and content without desire,\nso that their *spirit* resides within them\nand is never exhausted.\n\nThus, the Sage knows himself—\nknows his own gains and losses.\nHe does not display himself—\ndoes not flaunt his virtue and beauty outwardly,\nbut keeps them hidden within.\nHe loves himself—\nloves his body to preserve his *spirit* and *qi*.\nHe does not prize himself—\ndoes not seek high rank or fame in the world.\nSo he abandons that and takes this.\nHe abandons self-display and self-prize,\ntakes self-knowledge and self-love.\n\n**Chapter 73: Acting with Restraint**\n\nTo dare with boldness means death;\nto dare with boldness yet act means death to one’s body.\nTo dare without boldness means life;\nto dare without boldness yet act means life for one’s body.\nTo know these two things—\nthat is, to know boldness and restraint—\nis to know what may profit or harm.\nTo preserve life is profit,\nto destroy life is harm.\nWhat Heaven abhors\nis the act of forcefulness.\nWho knows its reason?\nWho can understand Heaven’s intent\nand avoid transgressing it?\nThus, even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\nThe Sage’s *Dao* is difficult to practice,\nlet alone those without the Sage’s virtue\nwho attempt to act thus.\nThe *Dao* of Heaven\ndoes not contend yet achieves victory,\ndoes not speak yet responds well,\ndoes not summon yet comes naturally.\nIt is vast yet good at planning.\nVast, indeed, is Heaven’s *Dao*,\nyet it carefully considers human affairs,\nrewarding good and punishing evil,\neach receiving their due.\n\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide,\nthough loose, it does not miss a thing.\nHeaven’s web is vast and far-reaching,\nthough seemingly distant,\nif it examines and judges the good and evil of people,\nit will not fail to see them.\n\n**Chapter 74: Restraining Punishment**\n\nIf the people do not fear death,\nthen the ruler’s punishments are too severe,\nand the people have no hope of survival,\nso they do not fear death.\nIf one harms their body through indulgence,\nif they squander their wealth and lose their life,\nthen the people do not know what to fear.\nWhy impose death as a threat?\n\nThe ruler should ease punishments,\nteach the people to abandon desires and profits.\nYet if they act with cunning,\nI can seize and execute them—\nwho would dare resist?\n\nThe *Laozi* laments the times\nwhen rulers do not first cultivate the people with *Dao* and virtue,\nbut instead first impose punishments.\n\nThere are always those who execute punishment—\nthose who execute punishment are Heaven,\nstanding high above, observing people’s transgressions.\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide,\nthough loose, it does not miss a thing.\nIf one acts as Heaven’s substitute in punishment,\nthis is called substituting the great carpenter to hew.\nHeaven’s *Dao* is most clear,\nits judgment has fixed rules,\nlike the seasons—\nspring generates, summer grows,\nautumn harvests, winter stores,\nthe stars and constellations move in their courses—\nto govern all with its fixed order.\nIf a ruler attempts to substitute for Heaven’s punishment,\nit is like a clumsy artisan\nsubstituting for the great carpenter to cut wood—\nlaboring yet achieving no purpose.\n\nIf one substitutes for the great carpenter to hew,\nthere will rarely be one who does not harm their hands.\nIf a ruler acts with punishments,\nit is like a clumsy artisan\nsubstituting for the great carpenter to cut wood—\nthey cannot achieve the proper square or round,\nand only harm their own hands.\nThose who substitute for Heaven’s punishment\ndo not understand its principles,\nand instead suffer its retribution.\n\n**Chapter 75: Harm from Greed**\n\n「The people’s hunger arises\nfrom the excessive taxes imposed by their rulers.\nThe reason the people suffer hunger and cold\nis that their lords take too many taxes from below.\nThus, they hunger.\n\nThe people all emulate their rulers’ greed,\nabandoning the Dao and defying virtue—\nhence, the hunger.\n\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed\ncomes from their rulers’ meddling.\nThe people cannot be governed\nbecause their lords have many desires\nand delight in intervention.\nThus, they are hard to govern.\n\nBecause their lords meddle,\nthe people’s emotions and falsehoods\nbecome difficult to govern.\n\nThe people’s recklessness with death\nstems from their excessive pursuit of life.\nThose who lightly risk death\ndo so because their obsession with life’s affairs\nand greed for gain endangers themselves.\nThus, they treat death lightly.\n\nBy pursuing life too fervently,\nthey court their own demise.\n\nOnly those who do not fixate on life\nare wiser than those who revere it.\nOnly those who solely do not fixate on life’s concerns—\nwho neither covet rank and honor\nnor amass wealth and profit—\nwho neither the Son of Heaven can claim as subjects\nnor lords can command as servants,\nare wiser than those who revere life.\n\n**Chapter 76: Admonish the Overbearing**\nHuman life is soft and frail,\nfor living beings are born with harmonious *qi*,\nembracing vital spirit—\nthus, they are soft and frail.\n\nBut in death, they become hard and strong.\nWhen one dies, harmonious *qi* is exhausted,\nvital spirit departs—\nthus, they become hard and strong.\n\nAll things, grasses and trees,\nare soft and pliable when alive,\nfor harmonious *qi* remains.\nBut when they die, they wither and decay,\nfor harmonious *qi* disperses.\nThus, the hard and strong are the remnants of death,\nwhile the soft and frail are the essence of life.\n\nFrom these two observations,\none knows that the hard and strong perish,\nwhile the soft and frail endure.\nThus, a strong army cannot conquer,\nfor its might invites reckless slaughter,\nspreading poison and resentment.\nThe weak overcome the strong—\nthus, it cannot conquer.\n\nA strong tree decays,\nfor its rigid branches and leaves\nsuffer from its own strength.\nThe strong lie below,\nthe weak rise above.\nIn cultivating things and achieving works,\ngreat trees must be placed below,\nsmall things above.\nThis is the natural effect of Heaven’s Dao—\nsuppressing the strong and upholding the weak.\n\n**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**\nThe Dao of Heaven is like drawing a bow.\nHeaven’s Dao is subtle and profound,\nand all things are likened to it.\nThe high are brought low,\nthe low are raised up,\nthe overabundant are diminished,\nthe deficient are supplied.\nSpeaking of a bow’s balance and adjustment as such,\nit can then be used.\n\nTo bring the high low and the low high,\nto diminish the strong and benefit the weak—\nthis is Heaven’s Dao.\nHeaven’s Dao diminishes excess and supplements deficiency,\nprioritizing moderation and harmony.\nHuman affairs are otherwise,\nfor human affairs oppose Heaven’s Dao,\ndiminishing the deficient to serve the excess.\nCommon folk diminish the poor to enrich the rich,\nplunder the weak to empower the strong.\nWho can truly use their excess to benefit all under Heaven?\nOnly those with the Dao.\n\nThe Sage acts yet does not claim,\nbestowing virtue and blessings without expectation of return.\nThey achieve their purpose yet do not dwell in it,\nfor when their work is done,\nthey do not remain in their position.\nThey do not desire to be seen as virtuous,\nfor they do not wish others to know of their own virtue.\nThey conceal their deeds and do not dwell on honor,\nfearing Heaven’s punishment for excess.\nThey trust in sincerity.\n\n**Chapter 78: Trust in Integrity**\nWater is the softest and weakest under Heaven,\nfor it adapts—\nround when round, square when square—\ncontained, it stops;\nunleashed, it flows.\nYet nothing can overcome it in attacking the hard and strong,\nfor water can embrace mountains and enclose hills,\nerode iron and melt copper.\nNo force can conquer water yet achieve its purpose.\nFor nothing is as effortlessly powerful as water.\n\nThus, the soft overcomes the hard,\nfor the tongue is soft while the teeth are hard,\nyet the teeth perish before the tongue.\nThe weak overcome the strong,\nfor water extinguishes fire,\nand *yin* consumes *yang*.\nAll under Heaven know this,\nyet few can act accordingly.\nThey shame humility and prefer strength,\nthus the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the filth of a state*\n*is to be called its sovereign.\"*\nA ruler who endures their state’s impurities,\nlike the great rivers and seas that do not resist small streams,\ncan long preserve the altars of soil and grain,\nand be the sovereign of a single state.\n\n*\"To bear the ill-fortune of a state*\n*is to be called the King of all under Heaven.\"*\nA ruler who takes blame upon themselves,\nand bears the misfortunes of the people,\ncan then rule all under Heaven.\n\nThis is straight speech taken as reverse.」\n\nThe Sage, though governing a great state,\nstill treats it as a small one,\ndemonstrating frugality,\nnot indulging in extravagance.\nThe people, though many,\nare as if few and scarce,\ndaring not to labor them.\nLet there be the *shí-bǎi* (units of ten and hundred),\nso that each citizen has their *bùqū* (military divisions and civilian groups),\nand the noble and humble do not encroach upon one another.\nThe farmer’s tools are kept,\nyet not used to seize their time.\n\nA ruler makes death precious to the people,\nfor when they bring benefit and remove harm,\neach attains their due,\nand the people value death over life.\nYet they do not move far away.\nWhen governance is simple and orders few,\nthe people settle into their occupations,\nthus they do not migrate far,\nand remain in their steadfast homes.\nThough there are boats and carriages,\nthey find no use for them;\nin tranquility and non-action,\nthey shun frivolous adornments,\nand do not delight in travel or amusement.\nThough there are arms and armor,\nthey display them not,\nand harbor no resentment toward all under Heaven.\nThe people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\nDiscarding artifice and reverting to simplicity,\nthey trust without deceit.\n\nThey find contentment in their food,\nin the simple grains and vegetables,\nnot plundering the people for fish and luxuries.\nThey adorn their clothing,\nin the plain and coarse garments,\nnot favoring the five bright hues.\nThey make their dwellings secure,\nin humble thatched huts,\nnot indulging in ornate architecture.\nThey take joy in their customs,\nin the plain and honest ways,\nnot altering them with foreign fashions.\nNeighboring states are visible,\nwhere the sounds of roosters and dogs intermingle,\nfor they are close at hand.\nYet the people, until old age and death,\ndo not visit one another.\nThis is their lack of desire for external things.\n\n**Chapter Eighty: Plain Speech**\nPlain speech is not adorned,\nfor plain speech is as it truly is.\nNot adorned means it is unembellished and genuine.\nAdorned speech is not plain,\nfor excessive ornamentation leads to hollow and deceitful words.\nThe virtuous do not argue,\nfor the virtuous cultivate the Dao in their conduct.\nNot to argue means they do not indulge in rhetorical flourishes.\nThose who argue are not virtuous,\nfor argumentative speech brings calamity.\nThe Sage does not hoard,\nfor the Sage accumulates virtue, not wealth,\nteaching the ignorant with their virtue,\nand aiding the poor with their riches.\nWhen they give to others,\nthey themselves grow ever more abundant.\nWhen they share with others,\nthey themselves grow ever more plentiful.\nThe Way of Heaven\nis to benefit and not harm;\nHeaven nurtures all things,\nloving them to growth and maturity,\nwithout injury.\nThe Sage’s Way\nis to act without striving.\nThe Sage follows Heaven’s Way in their governance,\nachieving their aims without contention,\nand thus preserves their sacred virtue.\n\n**End of the Fourth Scroll of the *Zhenjing* of Dao and Virtue.**\n\n*(The following lines are present in the Song shadow copy but omitted here:)*\n*\"Not their spirits, but their ghosts do not harm,\nfor their ghosts are not without vitality;\nevil cannot enter the virtuous,\nand thus cannot harm those of natural disposition.\"*",

taste.\nChasing and hunting in the fields cause the mind to go mad—\nThe spirit prefers tranquility;\nExcessive movement scatters the essence,\nThus the mind goes mad.\nHard-to-obtain treasures bring hindrance to conduct—\n*Fang* [妨], meaning \"to harm.\"\nGold, silver, jade, and pearls—\nThe heart is burdened by greed,\nIgnorant of contentment,\nAnd thus one’s actions harm the body and bring

\"the One\" is non-action, the child of the Dao.\nHeaven attains the One and becomes clear,\nEarth attains the One and becomes tranquil—\nmeaning Heaven, through the One, manifests its luminous forms;\nEarth, through the One, remains steadfast and unshaken.\n\nThe spirit attains the One and becomes numinous—\nmeaning the spirit, through the One, transforms without effort.\nThe valleys attain the One and become full—\nmeaning the valleys, through the One, remain abundant without depletion.\nAll things attain the One and thrive—\nmeaning all things depend on the Dao for their existence.\nThe lords and kings attain the One to rectify the world—\nmeaning they, through the One, bring order to the realm.\n\nYet if they overreach—\n\"overreach\" is a warning—concerning the following six dangers:\nHeaven, without clarity, would fear rupture—\nmeaning Heaven must balance yin and yang, alternating day and night; if it clings only to stillness, it risks fracturing and losing its heavenly nature.\n\nEarth, without tranquility, would fear eruption—\nmeaning Earth must embrace elevation and depression, hardness and softness, the five phases; if it clings only to stillness, it risks upheaval and losing its earthly nature.\n\nThe spirit, without numinosity, would fear exhaustion—\nmeaning the spirit must cycle through kingship, decline, and decay; if it clings only to vitality, it risks stagnation and losing its divine essence.\n\nThe valleys, without fullness, would fear depletion—\nmeaning the valleys must cycle through abundance and scarcity; if they cling only to fullness, they risk drying up and losing their nourishing nature.\n\nAll things, without generation, would fear annihilation—\nmeaning all things must follow the natural cycles of birth and death; if they cling only to life, they risk extinction and losing their true form.\n\nThe lords and kings, without humility, would fear downfall—\nmeaning they must humble themselves, seek worthy counsel; if they cling only to exaltation, they risk ruin and losing their rule.\n\nThus, nobility must root itself in humility—\nmeaning if one seeks true elevation, they must ground it in lowliness.\nLike Yu and Shi tilling the fields, Shun molding by the river, the Duke of Zhou dwelling in humble halls—\nhighness must be built upon lowliness.\nFor if the foundation is not firm, the structure will inevitably collapse.\n\nHence, lords and kings call themselves \"lonely and few, unworthy of the harvest\"—\n\"lonely and few\" signifies solitude; \"unworthy of the harvest\" signifies they cannot be the hub around which all else revolves.\nIs this not the essence of rooting in humility?\nThey speak thus to enlighten others.\nAlas, it is but deceitful speech.",

with life’s affairs\nand greed for gain endangers themselves.\nThus, they treat death lightly.\n\nBy pursuing life too fervently,\nthey court their own demise.\n\nOnly those who do not fixate on life\nare wiser than those who revere it.\nOnly those who solely do not fixate on life’s concerns—\nwho neither covet rank and honor\nnor amass wealth and profit—\nwho neither the Son of Heaven can claim as subjects\nnor lords can command as servants,\nare wiser than those who revere life.\n\n**Chapter 76: Admonish the Overbearing**\nHuman life is soft and frail,\nfor living beings are born with harmonious *qi*,\nembracing vital spirit—\nthus, they are soft and frail.\n\nBut in death, they become hard and strong.\nWhen one dies, harmonious *qi* is exhausted,\nvital spirit departs—\nthus, they become hard and strong.\n\nAll things, grasses and trees,\nare soft and pliable when alive,\nfor harmonious *qi* remains.\nBut when they die, they wither and decay,\nfor harmonious *qi* disperses.\nThus, the hard and strong are the remnants of death,\nwhile the soft and frail are the essence of life.\n\nFrom these two observations,\none knows that the hard and strong perish,\nwhile the soft and frail endure.\nThus, a strong army cannot conquer,\nfor its might invites reckless slaughter,\nspreading poison and resentment.\nThe weak overcome the strong—\nthus, it cannot conquer.\n\nA strong tree decays,\nfor its rigid branches and leaves\nsuffer from its own strength.\nThe strong lie below,\nthe weak rise above.\nIn cultivating things and achieving works,\ngreat trees must be placed below,\nsmall things above.\nThis is the natural effect of Heaven’s Dao—\nsuppressing the strong and upholding the weak.\n\n**Chapter 77: The Dao of Heaven**\nThe Dao of Heaven is like drawing a bow.\nHeaven’s Dao is subtle and profound,\nand all things are likened to it.\nThe high are brought low,\nthe low are raised up,\nthe overabundant are diminished,\nthe deficient are supplied.\nSpeaking of a bow’s balance and adjustment as such,\nit can then be used.\n\nTo bring the high low and the low high,\nto diminish the strong and benefit the weak—\nthis is Heaven’s Dao.\nHeaven’s Dao diminishes excess and supplements deficiency,\nprioritizing moderation and harmony.\nHuman affairs are otherwise,\nfor human affairs oppose Heaven’s Dao,\ndiminishing the deficient to serve the excess.\nCommon folk diminish the poor to enrich the rich,\nplunder the weak to empower the strong.\nWho can truly use their excess to benefit all under Heaven?\nOnly those with the Dao.\n\nThe Sage acts yet does not claim,\nbestowing virtue and blessings without expectation of return.\nThey achieve their purpose yet do not dwell in it,\nfor when their work is done,\nthey do not remain in their position.\nThey do not desire to be seen as virtuous,\nfor they do not wish others to know of their own virtue.\nThey conceal their deeds and do not dwell on honor,\nfearing Heaven’s punishment for excess.\nThey trust in sincerity.\n\n**Chapter 78: Trust in Integrity**\nWater is the softest and weakest under Heaven,\nfor it adapts—\nround when round, square when square—\ncontained, it stops;\nunleashed, it flows.\nYet nothing can overcome it in attacking the hard and strong,\nfor water can embrace mountains and enclose hills,\nerode iron and melt copper.\nNo force can conquer water yet achieve its purpose.\nFor nothing is as effortlessly powerful as water.\n\nThus, the soft overcomes the hard,\nfor the tongue is soft while the teeth are hard,\nyet the teeth perish before the tongue.\nThe weak overcome the strong,\nfor water extinguishes fire,\nand *yin* consumes *yang*.\nAll under Heaven know this,\nyet few can act accordingly.\nThey shame humility and prefer strength,\nthus the Sage says:\n*\"To bear the filth of a state*\n*is to be called its sovereign.\"*\nA ruler who endures their state’s impurities,\nlike the great rivers and seas that do not resist small streams,\ncan long preserve the altars of soil and grain,\nand be the sovereign of a single state.\n\n*\"To bear the ill-fortune of a state*\n*is to be called the King of all under Heaven.\"*\nA ruler who takes blame upon themselves,\nand bears the misfortunes of the people,\ncan then rule all under Heaven.\n\nThis is straight speech taken as reverse.」",
