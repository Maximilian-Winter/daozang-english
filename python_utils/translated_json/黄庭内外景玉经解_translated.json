  "full_translation": "**The *Huangting Neiwai Yujing* Explication**\n\n**Title:** *Explication of the Inner and Outer Jade Landscape Scriptures of the Huangting* (《黄庭内外玉景经解》).\n**Attribution:** Commentary by Jiang Shenshiu (蒋慎修注), of the Song dynasty (宋).\n**Source:** Fragmentary text. Original from the *Zhengtong Daozang* (《正统道藏》), in the *Dongxuan* (洞玄) section, *Jue* (玉诀) category.\n\n---\n\n**Explication of the Inner and Outer Jade Landscape Scriptures of the Huangting**\nPresented by the court official Jiang Shenshiu (朝散大夫赐徘鱼袋臣蒋慎修), who offers this work in progress.\n\n**The Chapter on the Immortal Daoist**\nThe Immortal Daoist is not one endowed with inherent **Dao/Way** (神).\nThe accumulation of **qi** (精) and refinement of **qi** (气) alone bring forth the True (真).\n**Dao/Way** (神) is the primal principle (元方),\nThe True (真) is a tangible reality (有物).\nIf **Dao/Way** (元方) were inherent to the Immortal Daoist,\nThen the True (真) would lack material foundation (物).\nThus, the True (真) arises only through the accumulation and refinement of **qi** (精气),\nAnd this is why it is called *True* (真).\n\nThe Inner **Huangting** (黄童) emits sounds that are hard to hear (内音难可闻),\nIts **Jue** (玉) scriptures bear crimson bamboo slips and vermilion-red writings (玉书绛简赤丹文).\nThe **spleen** (脾) holds the office of clarity (明),\nWithin it resides the luminous child (明童),\nHence it is called the *Inner Huangting* (黄童).\n\nThe Inner **Huangting** is threefold (三迭),\nAll achieved through recitation and contemplation (诵、味),\nSo that the five **zang** organs (五脏) do not engage with external things (外物),\nAnd this is why its sounds are called *inner* (内音).\nThe so-called \"manifestations of the heavens\" (诸天隐出)\nAre derived from this very principle.\n\nThe **Daoist** of ultimate attainment (至人) does not concern himself with mere hearing (闻),\nWhile the common multitude hears yet cannot comprehend (众人闻而不能解).\nIf one does not concern himself with hearing (闻) and yet hears without comprehension (闻而不能解),\nThis is what is meant by *hard to hear* (难可闻).\n\nThose who wish to hear and comprehend (欲闻且解),\nMust seek beyond mere words (元他焉),\nAnd discern the underlying intent (迹其意).\n\nThe Immortal Daoist pursues many methods (多方),\nYet the essence lies in harmonizing with the **Yang** (阳) to ascend together (俱升).\nThrough cultivation and refinement, **qi** (精) becomes **Pure Yang** (纯阳).\nThus, the scriptures are inscribed upon **Jade** (玉),\nFor **Jade** is the essence of **Pure Yang** (纯阳).\n\nThe **Upper Clarity** (上清) **qi** (气) descends to interact with the material world (下与物接),\nHence the bamboo slips are crimson (绛).\nThe crimson hue (绛) is the manifestation of the **Dao/Way** descending from the heavens (天道之降).\nThe **Pure Yang** (纯阳) is derived from the interplay of **One Yin, One Yang** (一阴一阳),\nThrough cultivation and refinement, it is perfected (修炼而成).\nSince it originates from **Yin-Yang** (阴阳),\nIts mixed composition forms the characters—\nThus, the **Yang** (阳) is called *red* (赤),\nAnd the **Yin** (阴) is called *cinnabar* (丹).\nThe **Yin-Yang** interplay of **Dao/Way** and **Virtue/Power** (德) is reflected in these colors (迹道德之意见於物色),\nAnd this is why it appears as such.\n\nThe scriptures bear the **Dao/Way** (载道),\nThe bamboo slips bear the writings (载文).\nThe **Dao/Way** is conveyed through the essence of **Pure Yang** (纯阳),\nThe writings are conveyed through the **Dao/Way** descending from the heavens (天道之降),\nAll in accordance with their proper symbolism (物宜).\n\nThe term *writings* (文) refers to the division of **Yin** and **Yang** (分阴分阳),\nAlternating between softness and rigidity (迭用柔刚),\nCombining and interweaving (参伍错综),\nTo establish principles and effects (以成理致).\nIn human affairs, it is the adornment (华),\nIn the seasons, it is the summer (夏).\nThe **Dao/Way** descends to complete its work (天道下济),\nAnd all transformations reveal themselves in this season (万化呈露於斯时).\n\nTo analyze the refined essence of principles (析理精微),\nTo embrace the luminous mysteries of the **Dao/Way** (拥莹道妙),\nThen the meaning of *vermilion-red* (赤) and *cinnabar* (丹) becomes clear.\n\nThe characters read: *True Person, Golden Person* (真人巾金巾).\nThose who comprehend this meaning,\nUnderstand the accumulation of **qi** (精) and refinement of **qi** (气)\nTo achieve the True (真).\n\nThe term *characters* (字) is used because,\nOnce the **Dao/Way** is perfected (道成),\nOne is held in high esteem (尊),\nAnd thus their names are exalted (褒).\nThe *Laozi* says, *\"The character is called **Dao/Way**\"* (老子云字之日道),\nWhich aligns with this sentiment.\n\nThe *Golden Person* (金巾) and *True Person* (真人) are adornments,\nFor the **qi** (精气) generated by the **Dao/Way** (道)\nAll originates from the **lungs** (肺),\nHence their embellishments are described thus.\n\n**Carrying Armor and Holding Talismans to Open the Seven Gates** (负甲持符开七门),\n**Fire Soldiers with Talismans and Diagrams to Guard the Spirit Pass** (火兵符图备灵关).\n*Carrying Armor* (负甲) refers to the creatures of the North—tortoises and serpents (龟蛇之属),\nWhich rely on **Yin** (阴) for self-defense (背阴以自卫).\n*Fire Soldiers* (火兵) refers to the creatures of the South—crimson birds (朱乌之属),\nWhich face the **Yang** (阳) to subdue foes (向阳以制敌).\n\nThe *Seven Gates* (七门) are the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—\nThe so-called *Gate of Life* (生门).\nWhen the *Gate of Life* is open (生门外通),\nThe senses (六入) and nature (识性) merge within.\nThus, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Hearing stops at the ears, the mind stops at the talisman\"* (庄子日：听止於耳，心止於符).\nExtending this logic,\nOne knows that the use of the six senses (六入)\nAll depends on the talismans held between the window and the door (焦牖之问).\n\nTherefore, to *open the Seven Gates* (开七门),\nOne must first grasp the talismans (持符),\nAnd by holding the talismans, one opens them—\nThus, the fault of reckless action (妄作) is avoided.\n\nHowever, to *hold talismans and open gates* (持符开门),\nOne must first *carry armor* (负甲),\nFor when the *Gate of Life* is opened (生门一开),\nThe six evils (六贼) may enter,\nAnd thus one must urgently defend oneself (自卫).\nIf defense is solid (固),\nThen the True (真) will have no later calamity (后艰).\nThis is why one *carries armor, holds talismans, and opens the Seven Gates* (负甲持符开七门).\n\nThe *talisman diagrams* (符图) are the *River Diagram* (河图) and the *Nine Palaces* (九官),\nAll of which are my harmonious correspondences (皆我合也).\nThree on the left, seven on the right (左三右七),\nWearing the Nine on the head and stepping on the One (戴九履一),\nTwo and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet (二四为肩，六八为足).\nThis describes the entire body, from head to foot,\nAs nothing that the True (真) would engage with (元所不契),\nHence it can guard the *Spirit Pass* (灵关).\n\nThe *Spirit Pass* (灵关) is one of the *Three Passes* (三关),\nWhere the **Dao/Way** of the Three Talents (三才) is complete,\nAnd humans align with heaven and earth (人配天地),\nThis is why it is called *Spirit* (灵).\n\nThe flourishing or decline of **spirit** (精神) is the root of life (生命之本).\nInternally, it harmonizes with numerology (内与数合),\nExternally, it corresponds with talismans (外与理符).\nThus, the fault of reckless movement (妄动) does not arise.\n\nFor those who govern the realm (治国者),\nThe gates and passes are controlled by talismans and seals (符节).\nThere has never been a case where\nThe opening and closing of gates and passes\nDid not adhere to the use of talismans and seals (入出而不由符者也).\n\nThe gates are near (门近),\nThe passes are far (关远).\nOnce the gates are opened (近既启矣),\nThe distant passes cannot be fully secured (远者不可以元备),\nThis is why one employs *Fire Soldiers with Talismans and Diagrams to Guard the Spirit Pass* (火兵符图备灵关).\n\n**Front Proud, Back Humble, High and Low Deployed** (前昂后卑高下陈).\n*Front Proud* (前昂) refers to crimson birds (朱乌之属),\nWhich ascend (趋上).\n*Back Humble* (后卑) refers to tortoises and serpents (龟蛇之属),\nWhich descend (趋下).\nSince they are called *proud* (昂) and *humble* (卑),\nThey are also called *high* (高) and *low* (下),\nFor their *proud* (昂) and *humble* (卑) positions\nAre derived from their ascending and descending natures (因其昂而高之，因其卑而下之).\n*Deployed* (陈) means arranged and spread out (列而布之),\nWhich is the work of humans (人所为).\n\n**Wielding a Sword a Hundred Zang Long and Dancing a Brocade Banner** (执剑百丈舞锦幡).\nTo *wield a sword a hundred zang long* (执剑百丈) is to display mighty force (威烈之壮).\nTo *dance a brocade banner* (舞锦幡) is to agitate the vibrant writings (文探之振).\nThese are all the implements of the *Fire Soldiers* (火兵).\n\nThe banner (幡) represents the multitude (表众),\nTo make them joyfully follow (使人乐从),\nHence it is danced.\nThe sword (剑) represents victory over foes (胜敌),\nTo make them fear and submit (使人畏服),\nHence it is wielded.\n\n**Ten Disjunctions, the Empty Circle, and the Whirling Fan** (十绝盘空扇纷纭).\nThe *Nine Palaces* (九官) and *Ten Colors* (十色) interweave to form brocade (相属而为锦),\nAnd separate to form disjunctions (相离而为绝).\nThe *Ten Disjunctions* (十绝) are named for colors that do not interweave (色不相属),\nYet they are actually banners (幡).\nAs the *Scripture on Transcending Mortality* (《度人经》) states:\n*\"The Ten Disjunctions are the Ten Spirited Banners\"* (所谓十绝灵幡是矣).\n\nThe *gallbladder* (胆) section states:\n*\"Brocade robes of nine colors and green silk skirts\"* (九色锦衣绿华裙).\nThe five proper colors (正色) are five in number,\nWith patterns and designs added to correspond with the *Nine Palaces* (九官),\nWhile the wood element (木) emerges from the earth element (土),\nGreen and yellow blend to form green (青黄合体),\nThis is the tenth color (十色).\n\nThis chapter expounds upon the **Dao/Way** of the True Person (真人),\nEmphasizing the expulsion of falsehoods and impurities (驱除邪伪),\nAnd the preservation of the **spirit** (神守).\nOne must ensure that the talisman diagrams (符图) align with numerology (数),\nAnd that the mind resonates with the **Dao/Way** (冥契胳合).\nWhen external things approach (外物之来),\nThe True (真) will have no banner to resist (元帜可抵).\n\nThus, these ten colors are seamless and dense, without beginning or end.\nThough falsehoods and impurities wander daily at its borders,\nNone can penetrate its harmony.\n\nYet still the principle of expulsion persists—\nThis is the \"unconquerable\" made to await the conquerable.\nTo make the unconquerable,\nThere is no other method than relying upon the **virtue/power** of awe and clarity.\n\nThis is why the ten colors are complete,\nAnd correspond with the *gallbladder* section.\n\nYet the *gallbladder* belongs to Minor Yang,\nWith thunder and lightning shaking eight times,\nDragon flags sweeping the sky,\nSerpents awaken from their slumber,\nHeaven and Earth harmonize above and below.\nThus, its patterns coalesce into brocade—\nThe True Person stands apart from humanity,\nYet perfects the celestial within,\nIndependent yet unchanging,\nCirculating without peril.\n\nThis is how it transcends all things,\nAnd its patterns disperse into the *Spirited Banners*.\n\nThus, the upper text speaks of brocade banners,\nThe lower of the *Ten Spirited Banners*—\nTheir essence converges at the end.\n\n*\"The fire-bell tolls, descending through the smoke.\"*\nThe fire-bell is the *gallbladder*’s mighty voice.\nHere, it speaks of relying upon awe and clarity.\n\nFalsehoods and impurities sink into the lower **Dao/Way**,\nWhile the fire-bell soars through the upper **Dao/Way**.\nYet the *gallbladder*’s voice ascends but does not descend,\nSo the murky and hidden find their advantage.\nThus, though the fire-bell’s force flies high and crowns the heavens,\nIts use lies in its descent into the smoke.\nThe *gallbladder* section speaks of *casting*,\nBut here it speaks of *falling*—\nFor casting and falling complete each other’s meaning.\nSmoke cannot descend,\nYet to say it \"falls into the smoke\" reveals its swift, striking force below.\n\nFire is a yang substance,\nThe bell is of yin nature.\nThe fire-bell is yang containing yin—\nThe *li* (separation) symbol.\n*Li* above brings advantage,\n*Li* below brings use—\nThis is the principle of life and **Dao/Way**.\n\n*\"Where is the Yellow Obelisk between the brows?\"*\nThis is not mere branch—it is the root.\n\nThe *Heavenly Court* is the celestial station,\nThe *Yellow Court* is the earthly **Dao/Way**.\nThe earthly **Dao/Way** governs the interior,\nIts force is downward,\nYet because it is interior and downward,\nIt emerges upward to connect—\nThe bell has an *obelisk* within it.\nThe *obelisk* is a high path at the crossroads.\nBetween the brows is truly the *Heavenly Court*,\nYet the Yellow Obelisk also resides there—\nHence its name.\n\nThe Yellow Obelisk is the grand thoroughfare\nWhere Heaven and Earth ascend and descend in joyful union,\nGiving birth to ten thousand transformations.\nThus, the True Person’s **Dao/Way** lies in this subtle harmony.\n\nThis is how the upper and lower align as the Two Principles.\n\nYet the Yellow Court is positioned below,\nWhile the Yellow Obelisk is above—\nHence the question: *\"Where is it?\"*\n*\"Where is it?\"* expresses doubt about its location,\nFor the original **Dao/Way** is not there.\nThe original **Dao/Way** not being there,\nThe doubt itself is how it *is* there.\n\nBranches are derived from the root but are not the root—\nSince they are not the root,\nThey flourish and wither, changing daily and monthly,\nWhile the root remains unchanged.\nThe True Person returns to the root,\nRestores the mandate,\nAnd stands alone in heaven.\nThus, those who steal and boast—\nWith their written contracts, sharp blades,\nTheir gluttony for food and wealth,\nTheir grasping and relentless pursuit—\nAll these are tied to branches.\nTherefore, the True Person dons armor, wields talismans,\nOpens gates and guards the passes,\nShuts out external things,\nTurns light inward and reflects it back—\nThen even the shifting clouds of movement and stillness\nArise from the root,\nAnd the original emptiness dispels false accusations.\nThus, it is truly the root.\n\n---\n**Chapter of Purple Clarity**\n*The Supreme Dao Lord of Purple Clarity*\n\nThe Sovereign of the Original is the Emperor of Creation, the Monarch of All Things, collectively named as the One Sovereign.\n\nThe first chapter divided into two, but this passage unites as one—\nFor the previous section expounded on the Dao of the True Person,\nShutting out external things, reflecting light inward,\nObserving equality and inequality to discern the Original,\nRealizing truth and attaining the Way—\nThus named the True Person.\n\nThe Sovereign of the Original, the Monarch of Creation,\nAll converging as the One Sovereign—\nMutually arising and interdependent,\nIts Dao subtle and profound,\nBeyond the grasp of thought or discrimination—\nOnly the True Person can comprehend it.\n\nThe Great Mysterious and Great Harmonious attendants stand erect,\nTransforming and giving birth to all things, making me a transcendent.\n\nThe Great Mysterious—\nThe Northern Void Heaven, germinating and transforming things,\nTo solidify the numinous root.\n\nThe Great Harmonious—\nThe Eastern Azure Heaven, yielding and harmonizing life,\nTo manifest the numinous radiance.\n\nThese two deities attend in reverence,\nTheir homage to the One Sovereign—\nThus the Dao of transcendence is attained.\n\nThough the Dao of transcendence is vast,\nIts essence lies in preserving life.\n\nFrom the North’s binding to the Central Yang,\nThe principle of transformation and birth is complete here.\nYet the four seasons complete the year,\nAnd the Heavenly Dao is whole—\nTo halt at Central Yang is but its beginning.\n\nAscend ten heavens with a jade chariot,\nDay and night for seven days, cease not in contemplation.\nHeaven’s number is nine,\nYet ten heavens are spoken of—\nOne is void, as in the Great Yield’s void one,\nWhere the marvelous origin resides.\n\nThe ancient True Persons,\nRealizing truth and attaining the Way,\nUnderstood the One Sovereign’s intent—\nThus they could transcend beyond the nine heavens,\nSolely wandering in the void’s realm—\nThis is the ascent of ten heavens.\n\nAscending, they ride the waves of Yang,\nHence called the Jade Wheel.\nJade is pure Yang;\nWheel is the lower Dao.\nSpeaking of ascending upon pure Yang’s qi,\nFrom below to above.\n\nWhen Yang stirs from below,\nIt is the time of return.\nSeven days of return—\nThe number of return—\nContemplate to ascend above.\n\nTo ascend upon pure Yang’s qi—\nThis is no matter of indulging in sleep.\nThe ancients, upon hearing the Dao,\nFor seven days abandoned licentious thoughts,\nTill their bones stood erect.\nErect—\nThe opposite of sleep.\n\nYet this is the foundation of cultivation’s work—\nIf you practice it, you may endure long.\nAccumulating merit and refining—\nNot natural, but achieved.\n\n“Transforming and giving birth to all things, making me a transcendent”—\nThis is the Emperor’s decree.\nThe Emperor’s decree—\nNatural and inevitable.\n\nThus, *my* self is the Inner Dao.\nIf you practice it, you may endure long—\nThis is the result of learning.\nLearning’s result—\nNot natural.\n\nThus, the Dao is neither natural nor unnatural.\nThis text alone declares the unnatural as false,\nTo establish its teaching.\nWhen teaching is established,\nLearning and the natural align in unity.\n\nThis arises from sincerity and singularity—\nSincerity and singularity—\nThe matter of accumulating merit and refining.\n\nSincerity—\nOriginal doubt.\nSingularity—\nNo duplicity.\nDoubt the things of the world,\nAnd the world responds in kind.\nNo duplicity in the heart,\nAnd the spirit congeals.\n\nThe merchant of Shangqiu, believing in falsehood as truth,\nSwam the river and obtained a pearl—\nOriginal doubt, and the world responds.\nThe hunched old man of Cao,\nRefused to exchange all things for a cicada’s wing,\nThus he departed and did not return—\nNo duplicity, and the spirit congeals.\n\nThose who learn the Dao,\nNurture the Three Officials in thought,\nAnd all spirits respond to contemplation—\nSincerity is complete.\n\nYet if questioned by things,\nFew escape loss and fall.\nThus, sever the green of causes,\nAbandon fame and gain,\nWith a single heart devoted to the Dao—\nThen the Dao may be attained.\n\nGuard internally with unyielding truth,\nIn emptiness, serene and tranquil—\nThe spirit naturally manifests.\n\nInternal guarding is firm and unyielding—\nThe work of sincerity and singularity.\nInternal guarding—\nNo other seeking.\nNo other seeking—\nThen singularity is achieved.\nFirm and unyielding—\nHold fast and do not abandon.\nHold fast and do not abandon—\nThen sincerity is complete.\nSingularity and no other seeking—\nTruth is not lost.\nAdding hold fast and do not abandon—\nThis is the truth within truth.\n\nYet singularity and no other seeking,\nHold fast and do not abandon—\nMay lead to obstruction and stagnation,\nThus emptiness and tranquility\nSave from such obstruction.\nEmptiness—\nNot fixating on internal guarding.\nTranquility—\nNot fixating on firmness.\nThus internal guarding and firmness are clinging to methods,\nEmptiness and tranquility are beyond forms—\nWithout clinging to methods, one cannot enter the Dao,\nWithout transcending forms, one cannot attain the Dao.\nAttaining the Dao—\nNo need to seek the spirit,\nFor the spirit naturally manifests itself.\n\n**Chapter of the Hundred Grains**\nThe fruits of the hundred grains are the essence of the earth,\nTheir five flavors—external beauty, yet demonic and foul.\n\nThe essence of the earth—\nInsufficient to nourish the spirit, yet able to nourish the form.\nDemonically foul—\nInsufficient to nourish the form, yet their stench is all the more vile.\nTo call foul things beautiful—\nAll know beauty’s true nature is evil.\n\nInsufficient to nourish the spirit yet called essence—\nSpeaking of what may still aid the true self.\nFor it clings to the earth, there is a principle of affinity with the low.\nThis cannot compare with ascending ten heavens.\n\nStench disrupts the clarity of the spirit,\nBabying qi dissipates—\nHow then return to youth?\nThe three souls flit aimlessly, the soul’s essence decays.\n\nThe spirit’s clarity,\nWith purity, emptiness, and openness as ideal—\nIf indulged in food and drink, drowned in vulgar qi,\nIts purity and emptiness are lost—\nThus stench disrupts.\n\nBabying qi—\nReceived from Heaven, pristine and harmonious,\nNaturally firm and congealed within.\nYet as sight, hearing, eating, and breathing assault from without,\nDay by day, one orifice is pierced—\nThus babying qi dissipates.\n\nWhen the spirit’s clarity is disrupted daily,\nThis is not the way to return to youth.\nWhen babying qi is scattered,\nThis is not the way to restore infancy.\nThe soul is the essence of life—\nIf the spirit is scattered throughout life, it is never vital—\nThus the three souls flit aimlessly.\nThe soul is bound to the form—\nWhen babying qi is lost, the body decays—\nThus the soul’s essence decays.\n\nThe **Dao of Nourishment**—\nWhy not consume the **Qi of Grand Harmony’s essence**,\nThus ensuring life’s vitality without death—\n**Huangning** is where one attains **mixed repose**.\n\nHuman **qi** gathers to sustain life—\nWhen gathered, it brings birth;\nWhen scattered, it brings death—\nThus, those who consume **qi** do so to keep it gathered, never dispersed.\n\n**Grand Harmony** is the **Qi of Minor Yang**,\nSoftly yielding yet ever giving birth—\nThe mouth is its **orifice**,\nRinsing and swallowing **numinous elixir**,\nTo generate **radiant luster**.\n\nThese are the **fundamentals of life’s Dao**,\nNo need for external aids—\nSelf-sufficient in nourishment,\nThus one attains **no-death**.\n\n**Huangning** is the **repose of mixed vitality**,\nThe **spleen’s office** consumes grains and scatters **qi**,\nOverseeing all maladies—\nThus it ceaselessly moves, never still.\n\nNow, by nourishing **true qi** alone,\nNo need for external aids—\nThe **spleen’s original function** is fulfilled,\nThus one attains **repose and vitality**.\n\nThe text states:\n*\"In the previous chapter, it was said that\nWithin, one guards the **unyielding True** of **True qi**,\nIn the **emptiness** of the **center**, tranquil and undisturbed, the spirit rules itself—\nThis is the accumulation of **refinement’s merit**, to forge the **True Person**,\nThus this chapter utterly rejects external aids,\nNourishing with **true qi** alone,\nAnd one may attain **no-death**.\"*\n\nFor those **beginning their studies**,\n**Heavenly True** is yet unfulfilled,\nThe spirit’s guard is not yet firm—\nThus, to supplement **life’s Dao**,\nIt is because the **True** is still incomplete,\nAnd the nourishment of external aids\nCannot yet be utterly abandoned.\n\nHence, **Heaven** produces **essence** to nourish the spirit,\n**Earth** produces **essence** to nourish the form—\nThe **spleen** and **stomach**, harmonizing **virtue** and **merit**,\nBestow **fragrant luster** and **flourishing vitality**,\nTheir supplementation is vast indeed.\n\nTherefore, the **Bright Granary** (明童) oversees the blending of grains,\nAnd draws upon the five flavors—\nRefining and transforming to renew,\nMoving the **primordial methods**.\n\nIts dwelling place is called the **Huangting**.\n**Ting** is the **land of governance’s spread**,\nWhere **Lao Jun** (老君) in the **center** acts with purpose.\n\nWhen **refinement’s merit** is accumulated and perfected,\nWithin, one guards the **unyielding True**—\nAll grains and five flavors are utterly abandoned,\nIn the **emptiness** of the **center**, tranquil and undisturbed,\nThe **spleen** and **stomach** become like a **void chamber**,\nThus what is taken in is called **Huangning**.\n**Huangning**—\nThough not yet severed from **form and color**,\nApproaches the **stillness of motionless repose**.\n\nThis is why the **Ten Heavenly True Persons** (十天真人)\nOriginally attain **naturalness**—\nTheir foundation lies here.\n\nThe **Huangting Inner-External Jade Landscape Classic** concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**The *Huangting Neiwai Yujing* Explication**\n\n**Title:** *Explication of the Inner and Outer Jade Landscape Scriptures of the Huangting* (《黄庭内外玉景经解》).\n**Attribution:** Commentary by Jiang Shenshiu (蒋慎修注), of the Song dynasty (宋).\n**Source:** Fragmentary text. Original from the *Zhengtong Daozang* (《正统道藏》), in the *Dongxuan* (洞玄) section, *Jue* (玉诀) category.\n\n---\n\n**Explication of the Inner and Outer Jade Landscape Scriptures of the Huangting**\nPresented by the court official Jiang Shenshiu (朝散大夫赐徘鱼袋臣蒋慎修), who offers this work in progress.\n\n**The Chapter on the Immortal Daoist**\nThe Immortal Daoist is not one endowed with inherent **Dao/Way** (神).\nThe accumulation of **qi** (精) and refinement of **qi** (气) alone bring forth the True (真).\n**Dao/Way** (神) is the primal principle (元方),\nThe True (真) is a tangible reality (有物).\nIf **Dao/Way** (元方) were inherent to the Immortal Daoist,\nThen the True (真) would lack material foundation (物).\nThus, the True (真) arises only through the accumulation and refinement of **qi** (精气),\nAnd this is why it is called *True* (真).\n\nThe Inner **Huangting** (黄童) emits sounds that are hard to hear (内音难可闻),\nIts **Jue** (玉) scriptures bear crimson bamboo slips and vermilion-red writings (玉书绛简赤丹文).\nThe **spleen** (脾) holds the office of clarity (明),\nWithin it resides the luminous child (明童),\nHence it is called the *Inner Huangting* (黄童).\n\nThe Inner **Huangting** is threefold (三迭),\nAll achieved through recitation and contemplation (诵、味),\nSo that the five **zang** organs (五脏) do not engage with external things (外物),\nAnd this is why its sounds are called *inner* (内音).\nThe so-called \"manifestations of the heavens\" (诸天隐出)\nAre derived from this very principle.\n\nThe **Daoist** of ultimate attainment (至人) does not concern himself with mere hearing (闻),\nWhile the common multitude hears yet cannot comprehend (众人闻而不能解).\nIf one does not concern himself with hearing (闻) and yet hears without comprehension (闻而不能解),\nThis is what is meant by *hard to hear* (难可闻).\n\nThose who wish to hear and comprehend (欲闻且解),\nMust seek beyond mere words (元他焉),\nAnd discern the underlying intent (迹其意).\n\nThe Immortal Daoist pursues many methods (多方),\nYet the essence lies in harmonizing with the **Yang** (阳) to ascend together (俱升).\nThrough cultivation and refinement, **qi** (精) becomes **Pure Yang** (纯阳).\nThus, the scriptures are inscribed upon **Jade** (玉),\nFor **Jade** is the essence of **Pure Yang** (纯阳).\n\nThe **Upper Clarity** (上清) **qi** (气) descends to interact with the material world (下与物接),\nHence the bamboo slips are crimson (绛).\nThe crimson hue (绛) is the manifestation of the **Dao/Way** descending from the heavens (天道之降).\nThe **Pure Yang** (纯阳) is derived from the interplay of **One Yin, One Yang** (一阴一阳),\nThrough cultivation and refinement, it is perfected (修炼而成).\nSince it originates from **Yin-Yang** (阴阳),\nIts mixed composition forms the characters—\nThus, the **Yang** (阳) is called *red* (赤),\nAnd the **Yin** (阴) is called *cinnabar* (丹).\nThe **Yin-Yang** interplay of **Dao/Way** and **Virtue/Power** (德) is reflected in these colors (迹道德之意见於物色),\nAnd this is why it appears as such.\n\nThe scriptures bear the **Dao/Way** (载道),\nThe bamboo slips bear the writings (载文).\nThe **Dao/Way** is conveyed through the essence of **Pure Yang** (纯阳),\nThe writings are conveyed through the **Dao/Way** descending from the heavens (天道之降),\nAll in accordance with their proper symbolism (物宜).\n\nThe term *writings* (文) refers to the division of **Yin** and **Yang** (分阴分阳),\nAlternating between softness and rigidity (迭用柔刚),\nCombining and interweaving (参伍错综),\nTo establish principles and effects (以成理致).\nIn human affairs, it is the adornment (华),\nIn the seasons, it is the summer (夏).\nThe **Dao/Way** descends to complete its work (天道下济),\nAnd all transformations reveal themselves in this season (万化呈露於斯时).\n\nTo analyze the refined essence of principles (析理精微),\nTo embrace the luminous mysteries of the **Dao/Way** (拥莹道妙),\nThen the meaning of *vermilion-red* (赤) and *cinnabar* (丹) becomes clear.\n\nThe characters read: *True Person, Golden Person* (真人巾金巾).\nThose who comprehend this meaning,\nUnderstand the accumulation of **qi** (精) and refinement of **qi** (气)\nTo achieve the True (真).\n\nThe term *characters* (字) is used because,\nOnce the **Dao/Way** is perfected (道成),\nOne is held in high esteem (尊),\nAnd thus their names are exalted (褒).\nThe *Laozi* says, *\"The character is called **Dao/Way**\"* (老子云字之日道),\nWhich aligns with this sentiment.\n\nThe *Golden Person* (金巾) and *True Person* (真人) are adornments,\nFor the **qi** (精气) generated by the **Dao/Way** (道)\nAll originates from the **lungs** (肺),\nHence their embellishments are described thus.\n\n**Carrying Armor and Holding Talismans to Open the Seven Gates** (负甲持符开七门),\n**Fire Soldiers with Talismans and Diagrams to Guard the Spirit Pass** (火兵符图备灵关).\n*Carrying Armor* (负甲) refers to the creatures of the North—tortoises and serpents (龟蛇之属),\nWhich rely on **Yin** (阴) for self-defense (背阴以自卫).\n*Fire Soldiers* (火兵) refers to the creatures of the South—crimson birds (朱乌之属),\nWhich face the **Yang** (阳) to subdue foes (向阳以制敌).\n\nThe *Seven Gates* (七门) are the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—\nThe so-called *Gate of Life* (生门).\nWhen the *Gate of Life* is open (生门外通),\nThe senses (六入) and nature (识性) merge within.\nThus, *Zhuangzi* says: *\"Hearing stops at the ears, the mind stops at the talisman\"* (庄子日：听止於耳，心止於符).\nExtending this logic,\nOne knows that the use of the six senses (六入)\nAll depends on the talismans held between the window and the door (焦牖之问).\n\nTherefore, to *open the Seven Gates* (开七门),\nOne must first grasp the talismans (持符),\nAnd by holding the talismans, one opens them—\nThus, the fault of reckless action (妄作) is avoided.\n\nHowever, to *hold talismans and open gates* (持符开门),\nOne must first *carry armor* (负甲),\nFor when the *Gate of Life* is opened (生门一开),\nThe six evils (六贼) may enter,\nAnd thus one must urgently defend oneself (自卫).\nIf defense is solid (固),\nThen the True (真) will have no later calamity (后艰).\nThis is why one *carries armor, holds talismans, and opens the Seven Gates* (负甲持符开七门).\n\nThe *talisman diagrams* (符图) are the *River Diagram* (河图) and the *Nine Palaces* (九官),\nAll of which are my harmonious correspondences (皆我合也).\nThree on the left, seven on the right (左三右七),\nWearing the Nine on the head and stepping on the One (戴九履一),\nTwo and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet (二四为肩，六八为足).\nThis describes the entire body, from head to foot,\nAs nothing that the True (真) would engage with (元所不契),\nHence it can guard the *Spirit Pass* (灵关).\n\nThe *Spirit Pass* (灵关) is one of the *Three Passes* (三关),\nWhere the **Dao/Way** of the Three Talents (三才) is complete,\nAnd humans align with heaven and earth (人配天地),\nThis is why it is called *Spirit* (灵).\n\nThe flourishing or decline of **spirit** (精神) is the root of life (生命之本).\nInternally, it harmonizes with numerology (内与数合),\nExternally, it corresponds with talismans (外与理符).\nThus, the fault of reckless movement (妄动) does not arise.\n\nFor those who govern the realm (治国者),\nThe gates and passes are controlled by talismans and seals (符节).\nThere has never been a case where\nThe opening and closing of gates and passes\nDid not adhere to the use of talismans and seals (入出而不由符者也).\n\nThe gates are near (门近),\nThe passes are far (关远).\nOnce the gates are opened (近既启矣),\nThe distant passes cannot be fully secured (远者不可以元备),\nThis is why one employs *Fire Soldiers with Talismans and Diagrams to Guard the Spirit Pass* (火兵符图备灵关).\n\n**Front Proud, Back Humble, High and Low Deployed** (前昂后卑高下陈).\n*Front Proud* (前昂) refers to crimson birds (朱乌之属),\nWhich ascend (趋上).\n*Back Humble* (后卑) refers to tortoises and serpents (龟蛇之属),\nWhich descend (趋下).\nSince they are called *proud* (昂) and *humble* (卑),\nThey are also called *high* (高) and *low* (下),\nFor their *proud* (昂) and *humble* (卑) positions\nAre derived from their ascending and descending natures (因其昂而高之，因其卑而下之).\n*Deployed* (陈) means arranged and spread out (列而布之),\nWhich is the work of humans (人所为).\n\n**Wielding a Sword a Hundred Zang Long and Dancing a Brocade Banner** (执剑百丈舞锦幡).\nTo *wield a sword a hundred zang long* (执剑百丈) is to display mighty force (威烈之壮).\nTo *dance a brocade banner* (舞锦幡) is to agitate the vibrant writings (文探之振).\nThese are all the implements of the *Fire Soldiers* (火兵).\n\nThe banner (幡) represents the multitude (表众),\nTo make them joyfully follow (使人乐从),\nHence it is danced.\nThe sword (剑) represents victory over foes (胜敌),\nTo make them fear and submit (使人畏服),\nHence it is wielded.\n\n**Ten Disjunctions, the Empty Circle, and the Whirling Fan** (十绝盘空扇纷纭).\nThe *Nine Palaces* (九官) and *Ten Colors* (十色) interweave to form brocade (相属而为锦),\nAnd separate to form disjunctions (相离而为绝).\nThe *Ten Disjunctions* (十绝) are named for colors that do not interweave (色不相属),\nYet they are actually banners (幡).\nAs the *Scripture on Transcending Mortality* (《度人经》) states:\n*\"The Ten Disjunctions are the Ten Spirited Banners\"* (所谓十绝灵幡是矣).\n\nThe *gallbladder* (胆) section states:\n*\"Brocade robes of nine colors and green silk skirts\"* (九色锦衣绿华裙).\nThe five proper colors (正色) are five in number,\nWith patterns and designs added to correspond with the *Nine Palaces* (九官),\nWhile the wood element (木) emerges from the earth element (土),\nGreen and yellow blend to form green (青黄合体),\nThis is the tenth color (十色).\n\nThis chapter expounds upon the **Dao/Way** of the True Person (真人),\nEmphasizing the expulsion of falsehoods and impurities (驱除邪伪),\nAnd the preservation of the **spirit** (神守).\nOne must ensure that the talisman diagrams (符图) align with numerology (数),\nAnd that the mind resonates with the **Dao/Way** (冥契胳合).\nWhen external things approach (外物之来),\nThe True (真) will have no banner to resist (元帜可抵).",

root.\n\nThe Great Harmonious—\nThe Eastern Azure Heaven, yielding and harmonizing life,\nTo manifest the numinous radiance.\n\nThese two deities attend in reverence,\nTheir homage to the One Sovereign—\nThus the Dao of transcendence is attained.\n\nThough the Dao of transcendence is vast,\nIts essence lies in preserving life.\n\nFrom the North’s binding to the Central Yang,\nThe principle of transformation and birth is complete here.\nYet the four seasons complete the year,\nAnd the Heavenly Dao is whole—\nTo halt at Central Yang is but its beginning.\n\nAscend ten heavens with a jade chariot,\nDay and night for seven days, cease not in contemplation.\nHeaven’s number is nine,\nYet ten heavens are spoken of—\nOne is void, as in the Great Yield’s void one,\nWhere the marvelous origin resides.\n\nThe ancient True Persons,\nRealizing truth and attaining the Way,\nUnderstood the One Sovereign’s intent—\nThus they could transcend beyond the nine heavens,\nSolely wandering in the void’s realm—\nThis is the ascent of ten heavens.\n\nAscending, they ride the waves of Yang,\nHence called the Jade Wheel.\nJade is pure Yang;\nWheel is the lower Dao.\nSpeaking of ascending upon pure Yang’s qi,\nFrom below to above.\n\nWhen Yang stirs from below,\nIt is the time of return.\nSeven days of return—\nThe number of return—\nContemplate to ascend above.\n\nTo ascend upon pure Yang’s qi—\nThis is no matter of indulging in sleep.\nThe ancients, upon hearing the Dao,\nFor seven days abandoned licentious thoughts,\nTill their bones stood erect.\nErect—\nThe opposite of sleep.\n\nYet this is the foundation of cultivation’s work—\nIf you practice it, you may endure long.\nAccumulating merit and refining—\nNot natural, but achieved.\n\n“Transforming and giving birth to all things, making me a transcendent”—\nThis is the Emperor’s decree.\nThe Emperor’s decree—\nNatural and inevitable.\n\nThus, *my* self is the Inner Dao.\nIf you practice it, you may endure long—\nThis is the result of learning.\nLearning’s result—\nNot natural.\n\nThus, the Dao is neither natural nor unnatural.\nThis text alone declares the unnatural as false,\nTo establish its teaching.\nWhen teaching is established,\nLearning and the natural align in unity.\n\nThis arises from sincerity and singularity—\nSincerity and singularity—\nThe matter of accumulating merit and refining.\n\nSincerity—\nOriginal doubt.\nSingularity—\nNo duplicity.\nDoubt the things of the world,\nAnd the world responds in kind.\nNo duplicity in the heart,\nAnd the spirit congeals.\n\nThe merchant of Shangqiu, believing in falsehood as truth,\nSwam the river and obtained a pearl—\nOriginal doubt, and the world responds.\nThe hunched old man of Cao,\nRefused to exchange all things for a cicada’s wing,\nThus he departed and did not return—\nNo duplicity, and the spirit congeals.\n\nThose who learn the Dao,\nNurture the Three Officials in thought,\nAnd all spirits respond to contemplation—\nSincerity is complete.\n\nYet if questioned by things,\nFew escape loss and fall.\nThus, sever the green of causes,\nAbandon fame and gain,\nWith a single heart devoted to the Dao—\nThen the Dao may be attained.\n\nGuard internally with unyielding truth,\nIn emptiness, serene and tranquil—\nThe spirit naturally manifests.\n\nInternal guarding is firm and unyielding—\nThe work of sincerity and singularity.\nInternal guarding—\nNo other seeking.\nNo other seeking—\nThen singularity is achieved.\nFirm and unyielding—\nHold fast and do not abandon.\nHold fast and do not abandon—\nThen sincerity is complete.\nSingularity and no other seeking—\nTruth is not lost.\nAdding hold fast and do not abandon—\nThis is the truth within truth.\n\nYet singularity and no other seeking,\nHold fast and do not abandon—\nMay lead to obstruction and stagnation,\nThus emptiness and tranquility\nSave from such obstruction.\nEmptiness—\nNot fixating on internal guarding.\nTranquility—\nNot fixating on firmness.\nThus internal guarding and firmness are clinging to methods,\nEmptiness and tranquility are beyond forms—\nWithout clinging to methods, one cannot enter the Dao,\nWithout transcending forms, one cannot attain the Dao.\nAttaining the Dao—\nNo need to seek the spirit,\nFor the spirit naturally manifests itself.\n\n**Chapter of the Hundred Grains**\nThe fruits of the hundred grains are the essence of the earth,\nTheir five flavors—external beauty, yet demonic and foul.\n\nThe essence of the earth—\nInsufficient to nourish the spirit, yet able to nourish the form.\nDemonically foul—\nInsufficient to nourish the form, yet their stench is all the more vile.\nTo call foul things beautiful—\nAll know beauty’s true nature is evil.\n\nInsufficient to nourish the spirit yet called essence—\nSpeaking of what may still aid the true self.\nFor it clings to the earth, there is a principle of affinity with the low.\nThis cannot compare with ascending ten heavens.\n\nStench disrupts the clarity of the spirit,\nBabying qi dissipates—\nHow then return to youth?\nThe three souls flit aimlessly, the soul’s essence decays.\n\nThe spirit’s clarity,\nWith purity, emptiness, and openness as ideal—\nIf indulged in food and drink, drowned in vulgar qi,\nIts purity and emptiness are lost—\nThus stench disrupts.\n\nBabying qi—\nReceived from Heaven, pristine and harmonious,\nNaturally firm and congealed within.\nYet as sight, hearing, eating, and breathing assault from without,\nDay by day, one orifice is pierced—\nThus babying qi dissipates.\n\nWhen the spirit’s clarity is disrupted daily,\nThis is not the way to return to youth.\nWhen babying qi is scattered,\nThis is not the way to restore infancy.\nThe soul is the essence of life—\nIf the spirit is scattered throughout life, it is never vital—\nThus the three souls flit aimlessly.\nThe soul is bound to the form—\nWhen babying qi is lost, the body decays—\nThus the soul’s essence decays.",
