  "full_translation": "**Yiyin**\n\n**Title:** *Yiyin* (also known as *Ninefold Orthodox Yiyin* or *Master Li’s Yiyin*). Authored by Li Zhan of the Ming dynasty. Six juan in total. Base text from the *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*. Collated with the Qing-era Jiguge edition from the *Continued Compilation of the Four Treasuries* (hereafter \"Jiguge edition\").\n\n---\n\n### **Yiyin Upper Canon**\n\n**Qian** 乾, **Kun** 坤, **Zhun** 屯, **Meng** 蒙,\n**Xu** 需, **Song** 讼, **Shi** 师, **Bi** 比, **Xiaoxu** 小畜,\n**Lǚ** 履, **Tai** 泰, **Pi** 否, **Tongren** 同人, **Dayou** 大有, **Qian** 谦,\n**Yu** 豫, **Sui** 随, **Gu** 蠱, **Lin** 临, **Guan** 观, **Shike** 噬嗑,\n**Bi** 贲, **Bo** 剥, **Fu** 复, **Wuwang** 无妄, **Daxu** 大畜, **Yi** 颐,\n**Daguo** 大过, **Xikan** 习坎, **Li** 离.\n\n---\n\n### **Yiyin Upper Canon, Juan One**\n\n**Qian** (Heaven below, Heaven above)\n\n**Qian:** *Yuan* (Origin), *heng* (Prosperity), *li* (Benefit), *zhen* (Integrity).\n\n**First Nine:** The hidden dragon—do not act.\n**Nine in the Second:** The dragon appears in the field—beneficial to see the great person.\n**Nine in the Third:** The noble one toils ceaselessly by day, vigilant by night; though perilous, there is no blame.\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Or leaping in the abyss—no blame.\n**Nine in the Fifth:** The dragon soars in the heavens—beneficial to see the great person.\n**Top Nine:** The exalted dragon has regret.\n**Use of Nine:** Seeing a host of dragons without a head—auspicious.\n\n---\n\n**The Judgment (Tuan #2):**\nVast is the *yuan* of Qian! The myriad things rely on it for their beginning, for it unites Heaven. Clouds move and rain descends; the ten thousand kinds flow forth. The great light begins and ends; the six positions complete their seasons. Thus, it rides the six dragons to govern Heaven. The Dao of Qian transforms and changes, each attaining its proper nature and destiny. Preserving and uniting the Great Harmony—this is *li* and *zhen*. Emerging first among the multitude of things, the myriad states all find peace.\n\n**The Image (Xiang):**\nThe movement of Heaven is strong—thus the noble one ceaselessly strengthens himself.\n\"The hidden dragon—do not act\": Yang is below.\n\"The dragon appears in the field\": Virtue is universally bestowed.\n\"Toiling ceaselessly by day\": The Dao is repeatedly traversed.\n\"Or leaping in the abyss\": Advancement brings no blame.\n\"The dragon soars in the heavens\": The great person achieves.\n\"The exalted dragon has regret\": Fullness cannot endure.\n\"Use of Nine\": The virtue of Heaven cannot be made a head.\n\n---\n\n**The Words of the Text (Wenyan):**\n*Yuan* is the chief of goodness.\n*Heng* is the gathering of excellence.\n*Li* is the harmony of righteousness.\n*Zhen* is the stem of affairs.\nThe noble one embodies benevolence, sufficient to lead others;\ngathers excellence, sufficient to accord with ritual;\nbenefits things, sufficient to harmonize righteousness;\nholds fast to integrity, sufficient to manage affairs.\nThe noble one practices these four virtues—thus it is said: *Qian: yuan, heng, li, zhen.*\n\n**First Nine: \"The hidden dragon—do not act.\" What does this mean?**\nThe Master said: It is the dragon’s virtue in concealment. Unchanging in the world, not seeking fame, withdrawing from the world without distress, acting when joyful, avoiding when troubled—firm and unshakable: this is the hidden dragon.\n\n**Nine in the Second: \"The dragon appears in the field—beneficial to see the great person.\" What does this mean?**\nThe Master said: It is the dragon’s virtue in central correctness. Words are trustworthy in common speech; conduct is cautious in common deeds. Guarding against deceit, preserving sincerity, benefiting the world without boasting—virtue is vast and transformative. The *Yi* says: \"The dragon appears in the field—beneficial to see the great person\"—this is the virtue of a ruler.\n\n**Nine in the Third: \"The noble one toils ceaselessly by day, vigilant by night; though perilous, there is no blame.\" What does this mean?**\nThe Master said: The noble one advances virtue and cultivates work. Loyalty and trust advance virtue; refining words and establishing sincerity secure work. Knowing the utmost and attaining it—one may approach the subtle. Knowing the end and completing it—one may preserve righteousness. Thus, in high position without arrogance, in low position without anxiety. Therefore, ceaseless toil, vigilant in due time—though perilous, there is no blame.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth: \"Or leaping in the abyss—no blame.\" What does this mean?**\nThe Master said: Neither fixed above nor below, not acting perversely. Neither advancing nor retreating without constancy, not straying from the Dao. The noble one advances virtue and cultivates work, desiring to seize the moment—thus there is no blame.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth: \"The dragon soars in the heavens—beneficial to see the great person.\" What does this mean?**\nThe Master said: Those of the same sound respond; those of the same qi seek one another.\n\nWater flows toward the damp, fire inclines toward the dry; clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger. When the sage arises, all things behold him. That which is rooted in heaven inclines upward, that which is rooted in earth inclines downward—thus each follows its kind.\n\n**Nine in the Top: \"The dragon soars to its limit—there is regret.\" What does this mean?**\nThe Master said: Exalted yet without position, lofty yet without the people, the worthy remain below without aid—thus in action there is regret.\n\nThe hidden dragon is not employed—this is the lower position.\nThe dragon appears in the field—this is the time of release.\nAll day vigilant—this is conducting affairs.\nOr leaping in the abyss—this is self-testing.\nThe dragon soars in the heavens—this is governing on high.\nThe dragon soars to its limit—this is the calamity of exhaustion.\nWhen Qian’s primal yang employs the nine, the world is well-governed.\n\nThe hidden dragon is not employed—yang qi lies concealed.\nThe dragon appears in the field—the world’s patterns become luminous.\nAll day vigilant—moving in step with the times.\nOr leaping in the abyss—the Dao of Qian undergoes transformation.\nThe dragon soars in the heavens—thus it attains the virtue of heaven.\nThe dragon soars to its limit—moving in step with the time’s extremity.\nWhen Qian’s primal yang employs the nine—thus the celestial norm is revealed.\n\nQian’s primal yang is the beginning that brings prosperity. That which is beneficial and steadfast is its nature. Qian’s beginning can with perfect beauty benefit all under heaven—yet it does not speak of what it benefits. How great! How great is Qian!\n\nStrong and firm, centered and upright—pure and refined essence.\nThe six lines unfold and extend, communicating the fullness of its nature.\nRiding the six dragons in due season—thus governing heaven.\nClouds gather and rain descends—all under heaven is at peace.\n\nThe noble person takes the perfection of virtue as their conduct, a daily visible practice.\n\"Concealment\" speaks of what is hidden and not yet manifest, in motion yet unformed—thus the noble person does not employ it.\nThe noble person studies to accumulate it, questions to discern it, dwells in magnanimity, and acts with benevolence.\n\nThe *Yi* says: \"The dragon appears in the field—it is beneficial to see the great person.\" This is the virtue of the ruler.\nNine in the third place: doubly firm yet not centered, neither in heaven above nor in the field below. Thus it is vigilant all day, ever watchful in its time—though perilous, it incurs no blame.\nNine in the fourth place: doubly firm yet not centered, neither in heaven above, nor in the field below, nor among people in the middle. Thus it \"perhaps\" acts. \"Perhaps\" means hesitation—yet it incurs no blame.\n\nThe great person harmonizes their virtue with heaven and earth, their brightness with the sun and moon, their order with the four seasons, their auspices and omens with spirits and gods.\nPreceding heaven, heaven does not oppose; following heaven, they uphold the celestial seasons. If even heaven does not oppose, how could they be matched by mere humans? Or equaled by ghosts and spirits?\n\n\"Excess\" speaks of knowing advance but not retreat, knowing existence but not demise, knowing gain but not loss. Is this not the sage alone? Who else knows advance and retreat, existence and demise, yet never loses their correctness?\n\nQian is heaven. How great is Qian’s primal power—all things rely on it for their beginning. Having relied on it to begin, they must rely on it to end. If not for Qian’s primal power governing heaven, what else could it be?\n\nHeaven is but one thing among the myriad, yet without Qian’s primal power to govern it, how could it move clouds and send down rain, allowing all beings to flow and communicate, taking form and flourishing as they do? Thus it is said: How great is Qian’s primal power.\n\nPeople merely fail to comprehend Qian’s Way in its beginning and end—hence they do not know the greatness of Qian’s primal power. If one could but understand this, they would see that the six positions of the hexagram are all already complete in their time—it is only a matter of riding the moment to act.\n\nThus, dwelling in the first place, one rides the hidden dragon; in the second, the appearing dragon; in the third, the vigilant dragon; in the fourth, the leaping dragon; in the fifth, the soaring dragon; in the top place, the excessive dragon. All are Qian’s natural transformations—the sage merely rides the time to govern heaven.\n\nEach thing possesses its own Qian’s primal power—this is the rectification of each nature and destiny, which cannot be made identical. The myriad things share one body of Qian’s primal power—this is the preservation of the Great Harmony, which cannot be made different. Thus it is said: \"Thus it is beneficial and steadfast.\"\n\nYet each person rectifies their own Qian’s primal power, each possessing this resource to rise above the common multitude. To attribute the governance of heaven to Qian, the riding of time to govern heaven to the sage, and willingly to rot among the common things—is this not lamentable?\n\nThe preservation of the myriad states in harmony stems from this virtue of Qian’s primal power—how could there be a single day without peace? Yet to take Qian as heaven, the myriad as things, the sage as able to pacify the states, and the states as necessarily pacified by the sage—is this not equally lamentable?\n\nThus it is said: Qian—primordial, flourishing, beneficial, steadfast. These four virtues are ascribed to Qian, yet only \"how great\" is used to praise the primordial—its meaning runs deep.\n\nThe *Wenyan* says: Qian’s primal power is that which begins and flourishes. People see its beginning and flourishing but do not see the beginning of its flourishing. For the beginning of flourishing contains what is beneficial and steadfast—this is the nature of disposition.\n\nHow great is Qian’s primal power—it is surely what all things rely on to begin. Who knows that this beneficial and steadfast quality is also what Qian’s primal power relies on to begin? Thus it is also called Qian’s beginning. Only because it possesses this beginning can it then with perfect beauty benefit all under heaven. Otherwise, how could it be so?\n\nQian’s beginning can with perfect beauty benefit all under heaven without speaking of what it benefits—all under heaven receives it. That Qian’s beginning bestows such beauty yet does not claim its benefit—is this not a great benefit indeed? And who knows that it is precisely this beneficial and steadfast quality that makes it so? Thus it is again praised: How great is Qian’s beneficial steadfastness!\n\nStrong, firm, centered, upright, pure, refined, essence, beauty—though one might strive to describe it fully, there is no adequate comparison. For when disposition follows nature, it becomes the invisible virtue of strength, firmness, centeredness, uprightness, purity, refinement, and essence. When nature follows disposition, even the six lines of this single hexagram, unfolding and extending in all directions, fully express its inexhaustible meaning.\n\nWith six lines, there are six dragons to ride in due season to govern heaven. I know that even heaven does not oppose. Having ridden the six dragons, they naturally gather clouds and send down rain—all under heaven is at peace. How could they fail to benefit all under heaven with perfect beauty?\n\nGenerally, Qian’s virtue is an empty position—what is called \"how great is Qian’s primordial power.\" Heaven, humans, and sages all share it, so it does not distinguish which is heaven, which is human, or which is sage—making clear that they cannot be divided.\n\nQian’s steadfastness is a substantive virtue—what is called nature and disposition. Heaven, humans, and sages all possess it, so it does not distinguish which is nature, which is disposition, which is benefit, or which is steadfastness—making clear that they cannot be separated.\n\nThe *Wenyan* says: The primordial is the chief of virtues. Observing the words of the *Xiang*, there are only the four virtues: primordial, flourishing, beneficial, steadfast. Yet when the Master reads them, why does he elaborate so? When he says \"how great is Qian’s primordial power,\" he has already praised Qian’s primordial—his emphasis lies in the primordial, guiding people to embody the primordial through Qian, so that the four virtues are all subsumed into one.\n\nWhen it says, \"Qian’s primordial is the beginning and the flourishing,\" and \"beneficial steadfastness is nature and disposition,\" it further praises Qian’s steadfastness—here the emphasis lies in steadfastness, guiding people to understand steadfastness. Yet it also arises from the primordial to encompass the four virtues, which have never ceased to revolve and become one another. This is the Qian of the sage, not something others can partake in.\n\nWhen it says, \"The primordial is what is called good—is this sufficient to describe Qian and Kun?\" If one were rigid and rash yet still called Qian, or weak and ineffectual yet still called Kun, then Heaven would no longer uphold Heaven, and Earth would no longer fulfill Earth. What, then, would we rely upon for sustenance? This is inherently the self-possessed power of the most vigorous and the most yielding—what need is there for supplementation? Thus, the utmost yielding moves with vigor, and the utmost stillness embodies constancy. Earth’s capacity for compliance arises from this, just as Qian’s Dao transforms and each fulfills its nature and destiny. Heaven’s capacity for vigor arises from this: if vigor were merely supplemented by compliance, it would not be true vigor—its use stems from the primordial. If compliance were merely augmented by vigor, it would not be utmost compliance—its use stems from the primordial. Alas, how could this suffice to grasp the true nature of Qian and Kun?\n\nQian and Kun are one. Thus, *Qian* speaks of primordial flourishing, and *Kun* likewise speaks of primordial flourishing. Yet *Qian* speaks of beneficial steadfastness, while *Kun* speaks of the steadfastness of the mare. And not merely a horse, but a *mare*—how does this compare to the dragon’s transformations and soaring flight? Kun alone finds benefit in this because it is Kun’s steadfastness. Therefore, when the noble person sets forth and models themselves on Kun, they rest solely in the steadfastness of the mare. Thus it is said: \"Steadfastness in tranquility brings good fortune.\" When engaging in affairs, they find benefit solely in the steadfastness of the mare. Thus it is said: \"Benefit lies in eternal steadfastness,\" for it concludes with greatness.\n\n\"Great\" refers to Qian, which concludes with greatness. Only the primordial dares to take the lead, only the primordial dares to stand at the forefront, only the primordial dares to form factions—this is steadfastness. \"Those who take the lead go astray\" and below refers to the steadfastness of the mare. \"Taking the lead\" means acting as Qian, as the master, while we follow—thus we attain the master and benefit the master. Whether west or south, we guard our position, residing in the northeast. Only by following the master does the will remain single-minded and unwavering; by dwelling in tranquility and heeding the master, we attain constancy and avoid confusion. Such is Kun’s beneficial steadfastness—this is primordial flourishing.\n\nHuman life is upright, yet uprightness seems not to be square. Now, to speak of uprightness and also of squareness is because people know only uprightness but not that uprightness inherently possesses squareness. Is not the first thought of a person their upright and unobstructed true nature? Yet as soon as it arises, it is immediately perceived—what was first is upright, and what perceives is also upright. Perception leads to stillness, stillness to squareness. When it emerges, though upright and square are united, their essence is one radiant light. Earth’s nature is vast and deep, Kun’s virtue boundless—it cannot stand alone, which is why the lines speak of both uprightness and squareness.\n\nUprightness is correctness, squareness is righteousness. Correctness is about stillness, righteousness about action. Stillness is reverence—reverence is not deliberate intent but simply inward uprightness. Squareness is righteousness—righteousness is not acquired through imitation but simply through acting with benefit. How could this depend on learning to become beneficial? It is inherently unlearned and yet not unbeneficial—what doubt is there?\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Shi’s explanation: The dragon transforms and acts on its own, while the horse is tamed and used by humans. To be used by humans and also to be a mare is the utmost compliance. Yet utmost compliance without steadfastness falls into depravity, hence the benefit of the mare’s steadfastness.\n\nLi Tufang’s explanation: Utmost compliance is never unsteadfast. Utmost compliance is compliance with Qian. If one complies with Qian, how could one not be steadfast? If one seeks companions, joins factions, or travels southwest, one reverts to yin’s softness. Clinging to yin’s softness, how can one single-mindedly obey Qian’s command and achieve utmost compliance?\n\nAnother explanation: Kun’s Dao can be used by others but cannot act on its own; it can harmonize but cannot initiate. Thus, the noble person benefits from having somewhere to go. Taking the lead leads to confusion and loss of the Way, while following leads to compliance and attaining the master—this is why it is beneficial. West and south are Dui, Li, and Xun—all our companions. East and north are Zhen, Kan, and Gen—none are our companions. Two yin cannot use each other, so one must leave their kind. Breaking from companions and coming to the master resides in the northeast.\n\nLi Tuweng’s explanation: Qian is Kun’s master. As the master, Qian does not need to be sought; seeking it leads to loss, fostering thoughts of gaining companions and failing to single-mindedly obey Qian’s command.\n\nAnother explanation: With six in the second place, one may be called yielding. Uprightness and squareness are what it wishes to express, and when spoken, it is called sincerity. Loyalty perfects sincerity, and sincerity arises from within. Who does not proceed from this righteousness? Thus, the noble person’s loyalty and sincerity endure to the end of their life.\n\nIf one does not yet know this as the utmost but merely knows it as their ordinary words and deeds, not daring to abandon it for life, they too can preserve righteousness and minimize errors. Why? Because their daily diligence fears only not aligning with righteousness. Thus, those who know the utmost hear \"loyalty and reciprocity\" and immediately grasp the One Thread. Otherwise, they may spend their lives upholding loyalty and reciprocity yet never understand what the One Thread means. Therefore, Master Zeng regarded loyalty and reciprocity as the ultimate, while his disciples upheld loyalty and reciprocity to the end of their lives.\n\nThis marks the distinction between attainment and non-attainment.\n\nThe Master said: *\"Is there a single word one can practice throughout life? Surely it is reciprocity.\"* How true this is. For scholars, loyalty and reciprocity may indeed be upheld for a lifetime. Yet only when self-realization dawns does one grasp the utmost—this cannot be forced. Alas, must one first embody the *qi* of *qian*—firm, vigorous, centered, upright, pure, and refined—before such attainment is possible? If so, then the *qi* of *kun* surely cannot be spoken of in terms of knowing the utmost.\n\nThe Nine in the Fourth place stands at the apex of *qian*, poised between doubt and certainty. It seems to have grasped the utmost, yet dares not immediately affirm it. If one were to resolve to uphold this for life without finding inner peace, it would be a moment of tentative leaping. Thus, the Master admonishes: *\"Virtue values constancy.\"* Yet now, moving up and down—how can this be called constant? *\"Endeavor values perseverance.\"* Yet now, advancing and retreating—how can this be called persevering? Is it because the words of loyalty and reciprocity are flawed and unworthy of trust? Or must one sever all ties with the common and depart from the herd to become a perfected person? Yet once born among people, how can one stand apart from them?\n\nI say: what matters for the noble person in cultivating virtue and refining conduct is seizing the moment with courage and decisive action. Lingering between doubt and certainty—when will true peace ever come? Without doubt, there is indeed a day of attaining the utmost; but mere doubt—when will there be a moment of stillness? One must decide resolutely in due time to ensure freedom from blame.\n\nThe Nine in the Fifth place is the soaring dragon. Here, virtue, position, and timing—all three are fully realized. There is none more fitting for the world to behold than the great person of Nine Five. Yet Nine Two possesses virtue without position—why is it also called a great person, equally the one whom all things seek to behold? For in the world, only virtue is most noble. When virtue resides within me, how can time or position constrain it? Thus it is said: *\"From the Son of Heaven to the common people, all must take self-cultivation as their foundation.\"* If a commoner possesses the virtue of a ruler, they naturally become a great person worthy of emulation. If one in high position lacks virtue, though they occupy Nine Five, who would seek to behold them? Thus, where virtue resides, time and position are not the measure.\n\nCan we not observe this in our Master? It is asked: *\"If so, then all six lines are dragons—why only the second?\"* Because the dragon’s virtue in the second line is already manifest—what is called *\"dragon virtue in true centrality.\"* This is the dwelling of humanity, the inevitable refuge of the multitude. Thus, though it has not yet ascended to govern heaven, its virtue already pervades all. Though not a ruler, it possesses the virtue of a ruler. Why wait for *\"facing the light to govern\"* before the world becomes radiant?\n\nAs for the other lines, which must seize the moment to advance in virtue and refine their conduct, how can they compare themselves to the second? Thus, the first warns against premature action, recognizing the need for hidden cultivation. The top cautions against excess, lest it lead to the regrets of a dragon soaring too high. As for the third and fourth, if they do not *\"vigilantly fear day and night,\"* they may hesitate in their leaping—these are times for progress, not moments for emulation. Yet if one’s cultivated virtue and conduct are already manifest daily, whether as the second or the fifth, what prevents it? All are equally great persons, equally the ones whom all things seek to behold. What doubt remains?\n\nThe great person’s virtue aligns with heaven and earth. Alas, this is the great person—does Nine Five embody it? Yet the *Wenyan* does not speak of position or lack thereof. Is it truly the fifth, or does Nine Two fulfill it? It does not say *\"soaring\"* for the exalted or *\"manifest\"* for the lowly—how can we know if it is truly the second? My view is that such a person is one whom even heaven does not dare defy—not because they command heaven, but because they harmonize with it. Such a person is one whom even people do not dare defy—not because they stand above all things, but because they bring peace to all nations. Such a person is one whom even ghosts and spirits do not dare defy—not because they wield divine or spectral powers, or transform, expand, contract, hide, soar, summon clouds, or bring rain, but because it is so without knowing why.\n\nAlas, this is the great person—something we all share. How dare we shirk responsibility onto others?\n\nNine Five is the soaring dragon. Yet the Master speaks of *\"resonant voices and kindred qi, each following its kind.\"* Those not of the same kind may not wish to behold them. The third and fourth, the first and top—all occupy the six positions, yet remain unaware of one another. Thus, there is only one great person: Nine Two. Yan Hui was but one who approached it. Alas, the multitude is vast—one is not too few. Yet with Yan Hui’s passing, none remained. How poignant is the Master’s lament for the interval between the second and fifth!\n\nTo know when to advance and when to retreat is to be a sage, to never lose correctness, and to avoid excess. Thus, though times may reach excess, the sage never does. Hence, the repeated emphasis on the sage is meant to encourage, not like today’s mediocre and vulgar readers who cherry-pick passages to serve their own ends.\n\nNine is the active expression of *qian*, so all lines of *qian* use nine. All nines in *qian* are dragons, hence *qian*’s nine is called the *\"dragon of the herd.\"* Yet the dragon of the herd can be seen, while the head of the herd’s dragon cannot. Without seeing this, one cannot become a dragon. Thus, those who use nine must truly perceive the head of the herd’s dragon, and naturally they will rise above all things, bringing peace to all nations. Naturally, they will seize the moment to ride heaven, and the cosmos will lie in their hands. Naturally, they will illuminate the beginning and end of the *qian* Dao, unifying heaven with a single origin, and all transformations will arise from within.\n\n---\n\nThus it is said: \"To employ the nine is to perceive the head of the herd’s dragon—auspicious.\" Auspiciousness is the *yuan* (origin), the *heng* (prosperity), the *li* (benefit), and the *zhen* (constancy). To employ the nine, the virtue of heaven cannot be made the head; if there were a head, it would not be called the virtue of heaven. Therefore it is said: \"When the origin of *qian* employs the nine, the celestial principle is revealed.\" Su Zizhan said: \"The origin of *qian* takes the head as the celestial principle.\" Alas, how perfect!\n\n**Appendix**\nZhuangzi (#6) said: \"The *Yi* (Changes) speaks of the Dao of yin and yang.\"\nYang Xiong said: \"The trigrams of Fuxi and the hexagrams of King Wen, with the six lines appended by Confucius—who arranged their images and composed their words—revealed the hidden workings of heaven and earth and established the foundation of all things.\"\nChen Tunan said: \"The August Sovereign Fuxi first drew the eight trigrams and doubled them into sixty-four, without setting down written words, allowing the people of the world to silently observe their images. If one can accord with the images, fortune and misfortune will respond; if one violates them, fortune and misfortune will reverse. This was the teaching without words of Fuxi.\"\nShao Yaofu said: \"The *Yi* is the tool by which the sage grows the noble and diminishes the petty. When the noble grows, it is checked before it comes to be; when the petty diminishes, it is sealed before it comes to be. One diminishes, one grows; one opens, one closes—all is harmoniously united in the origin, near and far. If not for the utmost spirit of heaven and earth, who could partake in this?\"\nZhou Maoshu said: \"The essence of the sage is revealed in the drawing of the trigrams; the sage’s profundity is expressed through the trigrams. Without the trigrams, the sage’s essence could not be seen; without the subtle trigrams, the sage’s profundity could scarcely be fully heard. How could the *Yi* be merely the source of the Five Classics? It is the mystery of heaven, earth, ghosts, and spirits.\"\nQiu Zhongshen said: \"The three lines of *qian* are the ancestors of all writing for ten thousand generations. The four words *yuan*, *heng*, *li*, and *zhen* are the origin of all principles of meaning for ten thousand generations. In heaven, they are spring, summer, autumn, and winter; in man, they are benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom; flowing between heaven and earth, they are the *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi* (great eras).\"\nCai Zimu said: \"The first line, hidden, corresponds to Yanzi—do not act, and virtue is perfected. The second line, emerging, corresponds to Confucius—abiding in season, radiant in culture. The third line, cautious, corresponds to Gao, Kui, Hou Ji, and Xie—overcoming hardship without peril. The fourth line, leaping, corresponds to Tang and Wu—abiding in obscurity yet ultimately transforming. The fifth line, soaring, corresponds to Yao and Shun—sagely virtue shining far and wide. The top line, overreaching, corresponds to Yi and Zhou—abiding in excess yet not losing correctness. These six lines, when distinguished, each accord with their time; when unified, they return to the great illumination of the sage.\"\nSu Shi commented: \"Those who soar today were once hidden—who among them is not a great person? Again he said: \"To abide in this, how could it be the way of endless regret?\" Thus, what is spoken of is not necessarily so. Again he said: \"When yin and yang harmonize, things are born.\" He said: \"Without prosperity, the auspicious rite is partial and stagnant, not in accord with righteousness; without benefit, it is harsh and discordant, not harmonious.\"\nLuo Yizheng said: \"The third line, situated between the two *qian*, bears the image of ceaseless activity; at the end of the lower *qian*, it bears the image of day ending and evening coming. The third line, at the top of the lower trigram, is a perilous position. Yet because it is ceaselessly active by day and vigilant by night, it incurs no blame.\"\nShi Shoudao said: \"Heaven is supremely high—how could it descend to interact with earth and thereby move the four seasons and give birth to the hundred things? The ruler is supremely honored—how could he not descend to connect with the people and thereby embrace the ten thousand states and govern the hundred officials? Thus, one must not reach excess.\"\nWang Ji said: \"*Qian* is the virtue of heaven. The numinous earth (#7) congeals to form the heart. The origin of desire is the original substance of the heart. This is what is called *qian*—the movement of heaven’s virtue circles the heavens day and night, unceasing through all ages. The alternation of the sun and moon, the intermingling of the four seasons, do not harm or conflict because of their strength. The movement of sagely virtue penetrates day and night, unceasing throughout life, in harmony with heaven. Those below the worthy cannot embody the origin of desire; their desires do not necessarily sink into excess, but wherever intention turns, that is desire. Reduce it again and again, until there is none. Man is determined by heaven. The strength of the noble is modeled on heaven.\"\nI have examined the celestial patterns: the movement of heaven has constant measure yet no stopping mechanism—does heaven not have a body? It takes the stars that cling to it as its body, like a support. For the North and South Poles are aligned, the North high and the South low; when observed through a tube, the pole is centered. One star rotates most closely, never leaving the tube—this is the pivot star, the hub of heaven’s axis. The body of heaven does not move; it is not that it does not move, but that its rotation does not depart from the pole, just as the opening and closing of a hinge does not depart from the socket—it has never moved. Thus it is said: \"The mandate of heaven is profoundly unceasing.\" That by which heaven is heaven is that, without distinction of far or near, high or deep, it receives the mandate like an echo. This is the pivot of creation, the secret treasury transmitted by a thousand sages.\nThe Confucians avoid speaking of emptiness and stillness. Yet when the Master discussed the principle of stimulus and response in *Xian* (Hexagram 31), he spoke of it in detail—why? Because all stimuli in the world arise from stillness, and their responses all originate in emptiness. Emptiness adapts to change; stillness spiritually responds—without thought, without consideration. Thus all movements under heaven are unified: Yao’s centrality, Shun’s subtlety, Wen’s solemnity, Kong’s silence, Yan’s foolishness, Zhou’s stillness—all are this thing.\nScholars of the world, clinging to canonical essentials, think and become benighted. The so-called body of emptiness and stillness is why the learning of the sages is not understood, and creation nearly comes to a halt.\n\n**Hexagram 2: Kun (☷☷)**\n*Kun*: *Yuan heng*, beneficial for the constancy of the mare.\n\nWhen the noble person sets forth, if they go first, they will lose their way; if they follow, they find their lord—this is beneficial.\nTo the southwest, one gains companions; to the northeast, one loses companions.\nIn tranquil constancy, there is good fortune.\n\n*The Xiang* says:\nSupreme indeed is the primal power of *Kun*!\nAll things draw sustenance from it, for it follows and bears up Heaven.\n*Kun*’s thickness carries all things; its virtue joins with boundless space.\nEmbracing and magnifying, vast and great, it makes all things flourish.\nThe mare is of the earth’s kind: traveling the earth’s boundless expanse, yielding and compliant, it finds constancy in advantage.\nWhen the noble person sets forth, if they go first, they lose the Way; if they follow, they attain constancy.\nTo the southwest, one gains companions and travels with their kind;\nto the northeast, one loses companions, yet in the end there is blessing.\nThe good fortune of tranquil constancy responds to the earth’s boundless expanse.\n\n*The Xiang* says:\nThe earth’s power is *Kun*—the noble person draws upon its thickness to carry all things.\n\n**First Six:**\nTreading on frost, solid ice will come.\n\n*The Xiang* says:\nTreading on frost, solid ice—yin begins to congeal.\nFollowing its course, it reaches solid ice.\n\n**Six in the Second:**\nStraight, square, great—without practice, there is no harm.\n\n*The Xiang* says:\nThe movement of Six in the Second is straight and square.\nWithout practice, there is no harm—such is the radiance of the earth’s Way.\n\n**Six in the Third:**\nHolding pattern within, constancy is possible.\nIf one follows the king’s affairs, without accomplishment there is still an end.\n\n*The Xiang* says:\nHolding pattern within, constancy is possible—it is timely expression.\nFollowing the king’s affairs—knowledge is vast and great.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:**\nTying up the sack—no blame, no praise.\n\n*The Xiang* says:\nTying up the sack, no blame—caution averts harm.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:**\nYellow skirts—supremely auspicious.\n\n*The Xiang* says:\nYellow skirts, supremely auspicious—culture resides within.\n\n**Top Six:**\nDragons battle in the wild; their blood is dark and yellow.\n\n*The Xiang* says:\nDragons battle in the wild—such is the harm of their Way.\n\n**Using Six:**\nBeneficial for eternal constancy.\n\n*The Xiang* says:\nUsing Six for eternal constancy—it ends in greatness.\n\n*The Wenyan* says:\n*Kun* is utterly yielding, yet in movement it is firm;\nutterly still, yet its virtue is square.\nFollowing, it finds its lord and attains constancy, embracing all things and transforming them with radiance.\nIs not the Way of *Kun* compliant? It bears up Heaven and moves in due season.\nA family that accumulates good will surely have abundant blessing;\na family that accumulates evil will surely have abundant misfortune.\nWhen a minister murders his lord, or a son murders his father, it is not the fault of a single morning or evening—its origins lie in gradual accumulation, in failing to discern it early.\n*The Yi* says: “Treading on frost, solid ice will come”—this speaks of compliance.\n\nStraightness is its correctness, squareness is its righteousness. The noble person rectifies the inner with reverence and squares the outer with righteousness. When reverence and righteousness are established, virtue is not solitary. Straightness, squareness, and greatness—without practice, how could they not be beneficial? Thus, one does not doubt one’s conduct.\n\nThough yin possesses beauty, it contains it to follow the king’s affairs, not daring to complete them. This is the Way of Earth, the Way of the Wife, the Way of the Minister. The Way of Earth does not complete but instead ensures continuity.\n\nHeaven and Earth transform, and plants flourish; Heaven and Earth close, and the worthy withdraw. *The Yi* says: “Tying up the sack—no blame, no praise.” This speaks of caution.\n\nThe noble person, centered in yellow and penetrating principle, occupies the correct position and embodies form. Beauty resides within and flows through the four limbs, manifesting in undertakings—this is the perfection of beauty. When yin doubts yang, there must be conflict. For it suspects excess in yang, hence it is called “dragon.” Yet it has not departed from its kind, hence it is called “blood crow.” That which is dark and yellow is the blending of Heaven and Earth—Heaven is dark, Earth is yellow.\n\n*Kun* is Earth, *Qian* and *Kun* establish their natures—one firm, one compliant. Firmness cannot become compliance, just as compliance cannot become firmness. To demand compliance of the firm or firmness of the compliant is to lose their essential natures. The two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun* would then be contrary to the proper order, not the true principle of Heaven’s supremacy and Earth’s subordination.\n\n*Qian* and *Kun* establish their positions—one husband, one wife. The husband cannot become the wife, just as the wife cannot become the husband. To demand the wife’s role of the husband or the husband’s role of the wife is to invert their proper places. The two hexagrams would then be out of position, not the true Way of the lord’s supremacy and the minister’s subordination.\n\nThus, above is Heaven, below is Earth—this is the *Qian* and *Kun* of the world. One husband, one wife—this is the *Qian* and *Kun* of every household. Their positions are fixed, so they cannot be reversed as a constant. Their natures are fixed, so they cannot be exchanged in function. When use matches ability, ability suits its use. This is why the sage first establishes *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nOtherwise, if a divine dragon were a mare, it would be of no use as a dragon; its soaring and bearing heavy loads over great distances would be mocked. If a mare were a divine dragon, it would be of no use as a horse; its carrying burdens and summoning clouds to bring rain would be beyond its ken. *Qian* and *Kun* alike—if not employed according to their strengths, both become useless. How much more so for humans?\n\nThus, the sage distinguishes *Qian* and *Kun* and expounds on them in detail. Yet世俗的儒者, drawing snakes and adding feet, claim that firmness without compliance leads to impetuousness and failure, while compliance without firmness leads to weakness and collapse. Alas! If this were true, how could they still be called *Qian* and *Kun*?\n\nIf one were impetuous and incapable of accomplishment yet still called *Qian*, or weak and ineffectual yet still called *Kun*, then Heaven would not uphold Heaven, Earth would not fulfill Earth, and we humans would have nothing to rely upon. They do not realize that this is precisely what the most firm and most compliant naturally possess—what need is there for supplementation?\n\nThus, utmost softness moves with firmness, utmost stillness embodies square virtue—this is how Earth achieves compliance. The Way of *Qian* transforms, each fulfilling its nature and destiny—this is how Heaven achieves firmness. If firmness were supplemented with compliance, it would not be true firmness; it would be of no use as firmness. If compliance were supplemented with firmness, it would not be true compliance; it would be of no use as compliance. Alas! How could this grasp the true nature of *Qian* and *Kun*?\n\n*Qian* and *Kun* are one, so *Qian* says “originating and prospering,” and *Kun* also says “originating and prospering.” But *Qian* says “beneficial to constancy,” while *Kun* says “beneficial to the constancy of the mare.” And not just any mare—it specifies *the* mare, contrasting with the dragon’s transformations and soaring. *Kun* alone finds benefit in this because it is *Kun*’s constancy.\n\nThus, when the noble person goes forth and models *Kun*, they rest in the constancy of the mare. Hence it is said: “The woman’s constancy is auspicious.” When engaged in affairs, only the constancy of the mare is beneficial. Hence it is said: “Beneficial for eternal constancy, ending in greatness.” “Great” refers to *Qian*—ending in greatness means not daring to lead, not daring to take precedence, not daring to form cliques—this is constancy. “First lost” and below refers to the benefit of the mare’s constancy. The first is *Qian*, the lord, while we follow—thus finding the lord and benefiting the lord. Whether west or south, we guard the northeast, for we follow the lord alone. With single-minded devotion and no duality, dwelling in peace and heeding the lord, we attain constancy without confusion—this is *Kun*’s beneficial constancy, and thus it is “originating and prospering.”\n\nHuman life is straight—one might think straightness excludes squareness. Yet we speak of both straightness and squareness because people know straightness but not that straightness inherently possesses squareness. Is not the first thought of a person their straight, unobstructed true nature? Yet as soon as it arises, it is perceived—what was first is straight, and perception is also straight. Perception halts, halting is square. When it emerges, though straight and square are united, their essence shines as one.\n\nEarth’s nature is vast and yielding, *Kun*’s virtue is boundless—how could it be solitary? Thus, the lines speak of both straightness and squareness. Straightness is correctness, squareness is righteousness. Correctness is for halting, righteousness is for acting. Halting is reverence, but reverence is not deliberate—it is simply the inner straightness. Squareness is righteousness, but righteousness is not forced—it is simply acting for what is beneficial. How could this depend on learning and practice to be beneficial?\n\nIndeed, it is not through practice that one fails to attain primal benefit—what doubt could there be?\n\n**Appendix: Su Shi’s Explanation**\nThe dragon is that which transforms and acts of its own accord. The horse is that which is tamed and put to human use. To be used by others and yet be a mare is the utmost in equine compliance. Yet such perfect compliance, if not steadfast, falls into deviance—thus the benefit lies in the mare’s steadfastness.\n\n**Li Tuhe’s Remarks**\nUtmost compliance is never unsteadfast. Utmost compliance is compliance with *Qian*. Having complied with *Qian*, how could one not be steadfast? If one joins with allies, associates with one’s kind, or travels southwest, then by yielding to yin one clings again to yin—how can one wholeheartedly heed *Qian*’s command and attain the utmost greatness?\n\n**Further Explanation**\nThe Way of *Kun* may be employed by others but cannot act on its own; it may harmonize but cannot initiate. Thus, the noble person benefits from having somewhere to go. To precede is to go astray and lose the Way; to follow is to comply and fulfill one’s aspirations—this is why it is beneficial. West and south are *Dui*, *Li*, and *Xun*—all our allies. East and north are *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen*—none of them our allies. Two yin forces cannot employ each other, so one must depart from one’s kind. To sever ties with allies and come forth is to be bound to restraint.\n\n**Li Tuweng’s Remarks**\n*Qian* is *Kun*’s master. *Qian* being the master, one need not seek it—seeking it only leads to loss, giving rise to thoughts of gaining allies. Then one cannot wholeheartedly heed *Qian*’s command.\n\n**Further Explanation**\nWith six in the second place, one may be called yielding. But how does one attain straightness, squareness, and greatness? It is said: the second six is the utmost in compliance. The noble person’s compliance—what else could it be? It is simply following principle without self-interest.\n\n**Tuweng’s Remarks**\nUtmost softness moves with hardness; utmost stillness embodies squareness. The Master has already explained this perfectly—there is no need to rephrase it as \"following principle without self-interest.\" It is precisely because of its utmost softness that it attains utmost hardness; precisely because of its utmost stillness that it attains utmost squareness. Softness is possible, but utmost softness is not. Alas, how perfect!\n\n**Further Explanation**\nDwelling at the junction of above and below, neither position is secure. *Qian* is secure above, for it sees danger in not yet having reached the top—thus the third nine harbors the anxiety of evening vigilance. *Kun* is secure below, for it finds difficulty in first reaching above—thus the fourth six exercises the caution of tying one’s sack. For yin to advance to the third place may still be steadfast, but to reach the fourth is perilous. Thus, one binds and seals oneself to seek freedom from blame and primal praise. Blame and praise are what people cannot escape: emerging from blame, one enters praise; shedding praise, one is ensnared by blame. Blame leads to guilt, and praise leads to suspicion—how severe is the difficulty of attaining primal praise!\n\n**Further Explanation**\nWhen it transforms, even grasses and trees flourish. When it closes, even the worthy withdraw.\n\n**Tuweng’s Remarks**\nReading this, one may weep in sorrow.\n\n**Further Explanation**\nYellow is the color of the center, present only when principle is fully realized—it is the adornment beneath the lower garment. If it were yellow but not the lower garment, it would belong to the upper body. If it were the lower garment but not yellow, it would not be the lower body in its proper position. Now, occupying the correct position in the doubled *Kun* and dwelling at the center of the lower body, it is called the lower garment to clarify its lower position and yellow to clarify its centrality. For pattern in the *Yi* arises from intermingling. If yin and yang were each absolute, how could there be pattern?\n\n**Tuweng’s Remarks**\nAbsolute unity itself gives rise to pattern. *Kun* does not value pattern—what it values is pattern within, the color of the central yellow. If pattern is within, why must it depend on intermingling to exist?\n\n**Cheng Zhengshu’s Remarks**\nThe southwest is the direction of yin; the northeast, the direction of yang. Yin must follow yang, abandoning its own kind.\n\n**Zhu Zhonghui’s Remarks**\nIn this hexagram, all three lines are even, hence its name *Kun* and its image of earth. Doubling it yields *Kun* again, signifying the utmost in pure yin compliance. It is further said: the fifth six, with yin occupying the honored position, embodies the virtue of central compliance, manifesting both internally and externally—thus its image is such, and its oracle is supremely auspicious.\n\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* records that when Nan Kuai planned rebellion, he divined and obtained this line, taking it as greatly auspicious. Zifu Huibo said: \"If it is a matter of loyalty and trust, it may be so; otherwise, it will surely fail. Outward strength and inner warmth are loyalty. Harmony in leading with steadfastness is trust. Thus it is said: *Yellow lower garment, primal auspiciousness*—yellow is the color of the center, the adornment beneath the garment, the chief of all virtues. Without loyalty, one cannot attain its color; without reverence, one cannot attain its adornment; without goodness, one cannot reach its extremity. Moreover, the *Yi* cannot be used to divine peril. If any of these three are lacking, even if the divination is correct, it is not yet so.\" Later, Kuai indeed failed.\n\n**Jin Rubai’s Remarks**\n\"First lost\" is one phrase; \"later attains the master and benefits\" is another. The master of yin and yang is yang first, yin later—this is the constant principle. If yin precedes, it reverses the constant and goes astray; if it follows, it attains its master and benefits. Benefit is like compliance. Thus it is said: \"Following, it attains the constant.\" It is also said: \"Later attaining the master, it has constancy.\" Some scholars take \"attains the master and benefits\" as a single phrase, thus reading \"later attains the master and has constancy,\" omitting the word \"benefits.\" But then how could \"following, it attains the constant\" also omit it? Yin ought to follow yang—can it cling to its own kind? To lose allies is like *Tai*’s \"allies lost\"—abandoning one’s allies to follow yang, thus auspicious.\n\n**Zheng Zhifu’s Remarks**\nThe image of *Qian* reveals King Wen’s virtue in founding Zhou; the image of *Kun* reveals King Wen’s heart in serving Yin.\n\n**Zhou Yan’s Remarks**\nThe first nine of *Qian* says: \"Do not act,\" guarding its subtlety. The first six of *Kun* immediately says: \"Firm ice arrives,\" warning of its excess.\n\nLiu Junbo remarked: The third six, with yin enveloping yang, takes the image of \"containing brilliance.\" The fourth six, occupying the fourth position as a yin line, takes the image of \"tying the sack.\" The sack’s emptiness at its center mirrors the heavy yin’s knotted closure. He further said: Treacherous and ambitious ministers brazenly seize power. Though the ruler may be weak and benighted, they do not yield. Stiffened corpses and flowing blood—such is the inevitable outcome. \"Treading on frost, firm ice arrives\"—this is precisely the warning. Hu Zhonghu said: \"Its blood is dark and yellow,\" both sides suffer injury. Though yin may reach its extreme, how could it harm yang alone? You Dingfu said: *Qian* is pure yang; when yang reaches its extreme, it becomes overbearing. *Kun* is pure yin; when yin reaches its extreme, it wages war. If they do not transform, overbearing brings disaster, war brings injury—neither can be avoided. Yang Jingzhong said: When yin ascends to the sixth, yang is nearly extinguished. Yet though yang is faint, its name and position remain—it cannot be obliterated. At such a time, people see only the sixth; who still recognizes yang? The sage deplores its usurpation of yang, thus specially invokes the dragon to show that the dragon still dwells in the human heart, never to be forgotten or slighted. Blood is a yin substance; calling it \"blood\" clarifies that the sixth has not yet departed from the category of ministers. Both yin and yang are injured—not yang alone. Thus the sage uses this to temper the hearts of overbearing rulers.\n\n**On \"Using Six\" and \"Using Nine\"**\nThe *Yi* combines the Three Powers and doubles them, forming hexagrams with six lines—is this not \"using six\"? He further said: Six is nothing other than the Dao of the Three Powers. With six and three, is this not \"using nine\"?—*Note appended by Wang Benhe of Xin’an.*\n\n**Hexagram 3: Tun (屯) – Difficulty at the Beginning**\n*Below Zhen (震), above Kan (坎).*\n**Tun:** Primordial, pervasive, beneficial, and steadfast. Do not act; there is somewhere to go—it is beneficial to establish lords.\n**The Image says:** *Tun*—hard and soft first meet and difficulty arises, movement within peril. Greatly pervasive and steadfast. The movement of thunder and rain fills all; heaven creates in the unformed. It is fitting to establish lords and not rest.\n**The Image says:** Clouds and thunder—*Tun*. The noble person thereby orders and weaves.\n\n**First Nine:** Hesitating; beneficial to dwell in steadfastness, beneficial to establish lords.\n**The Image says:** Though hesitating, its aspiration is rightly conducted. Placing the noble below the lowly—greatly gaining the people.\n\n**Second Six:** Entangled and beset, riding horses in disarray. Not bandits but marriage—if the woman is steadfast, she does not conceive; after ten years, she conceives.\n**The Image says:** The second six’s difficulty comes from mounting the firm. After ten years, she conceives—returning to the norm.\n\n**Third Six:** Pursuing deer without a guide, entering the forest’s depths. The noble person nearly does not desist—going brings regret.\n**The Image says:** Pursuing deer without a guide is to follow game. The noble person desists—going brings regret and exhaustion.\n\n**Fourth Six:** Riding horses in disarray, seeking marriage. Going is auspicious; nothing is unfavorable.\n**The Image says:** Seeking and going—clarity.\n\n**Ninth Five:** Difficulty storing its richness. Small steadfastness is auspicious; great steadfastness is inauspicious.\n**The Image says:** Difficulty storing its richness—its bestowal is not yet radiant.\n\n**Top Six:** Riding horses in disarray, weeping blood in streams.\n**The Image says:** Weeping blood in streams—how can this last?\n\n**Hexagram 3: Water over Thunder – Tun**\nFang Shihua said: Following *Kun*, this hexagram is *Tun*. What is *Tun*? *Zhen* brings one yang to dwell below *Kun*—thus hard and soft first meet. Yet *Kan* and *Li* arise before it—thus hard and soft first meet and difficulty arises. What else could this be but *Tun*? *Tun* is the re-creation of *Qian* and *Kun*, the true lord’s resurgence in the unformed time. Now, one yang stirs within *Kan*’s peril—how could it not be primordial, pervasive, beneficial, and steadfast? Thus, there is no need for further action; people naturally come to submit, and it is beneficial to establish lords. Observe the movement of thunder and rain filling all—heaven creates in the unformed, precisely the time to establish lords without rest. That *Zhen*’s one yang comes to dwell below this lower trigram is the power to place the noble below the lowly and greatly gain the people’s hearts. Such a person is precisely one for whom it is beneficial to establish lords and not rest. When heaven has this time, people must have this affair—thus the first nine acts in accord with the moment. Though one hears its sound, its form is unseen; dwelling in steadfastness as usual, guarding correctness as before, hesitating yet unwavering, not shifting a step—people naturally come to submit. Thus it is said: Though hesitating, its aspiration is rightly conducted. Its right conduct suffices to shake the age; it cannot abandon the first and go elsewhere. What further need is there for action? Thus the *Image* simply says: Do not act; there is somewhere to go. And the line reiterates: Hesitating, yet beneficial to dwell in steadfastness. The second six, soft and correct, mounts the first’s firm correctness—hence entangled, beset, riding horses in disarray, so difficult that it cannot easily be betrothed to the younger brother. Yet the first is the age’s destination; I, too, am adjacent to the first, sought day and night for marriage. Though not bandits, after ten years she conceives—reversing the norm. Matching sages with sages, exalting worthies with worthies—this too must have its Dao. The third six, in an age of deer-chasing, hopes day and night to obtain it. Yet above, there is no correspondence—no guide. Without a guide, why enter the forest? Thus desisting is the wise course. The fourth six is clear. In the time of *Tun*, how could there be another like the first to seek? Riding horses in disarray, carefully seeking this proper match in marriage—going is auspicious; what is not favorable? Thus it is said: Seeking and going—clarity. The first nine is the true lord; thus even if there is steadfast auspiciousness like the ninth five, its richness is stored with difficulty, and its bestowal is not yet radiant.\n\nThe minor may be auspicious, but the great is inauspicious—though steadfast, what does it avail? This is like the King of Yue in Song, who ultimately submitted his fate to the Founding Ancestor. The sixth yang is precisely the one who chases the deer of the third line yet remains unaware. The abandoner is one who, having reached the extremity of the third’s path, finds himself at an impasse. Thus it is said: riding horses in disarray, weeping blood in streams.\n\nThe Master lamented: How can this endure? It is the fault of failing to descend. Wang Benhe said: Though the first remains hesitant and does not proceed, its will is truly upright—others cannot abandon it; what need is there to act? Its union with the second is what is called the first meeting of firm and yielding, a match made by Heaven—what need is there to await betrothal?\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Fusi said: Thunder and rain in fullness—all arise from the first meeting of firm and yielding. *Tun* is the time of Heaven and Earth’s inception, the beginning of creation, which arises from obscurity; thus it is called the \"dawn of chaos.\" To quell disorder with stillness, to uphold stillness while awaiting—pacifying the people lies in rectitude, and magnifying rectitude lies in humility. In an age of *Tun*-difficulties, yin seeks yang, the weak seeks the strong—it is a time when the people yearn for their lord. The first line stands at the head, and the one below it is singular; the hexagram’s lines embody this principle, and thus it rightfully gains the people’s allegiance.\n\nYu Lingsheng said: The people are restless—without the noble one, there is no peace. After the realm has endured the peril of *Tun*-difficulties, the later king should govern with the policy of thunder and rain. Jin Rubai said: Eagerness to establish lords is itself a lack of peace—not that establishing lords brings further unrest. Luo Yizheng said: The unshakable boulder, the sturdy plank—both are things difficult to move, hence they serve as metaphors for the appearance of difficult progress. Hu Zhonghu said: The hexagram’s judgment sometimes refers specifically to the hexagram’s ruling line; here, the ruling line is *Zhen* (Thunder), and *Zhen* governs the first line. \"Hesitating\" corresponds to \"do not yet have somewhere to go,\" \"favorable to abide in steadfastness\" corresponds to \"favorable to be steadfast\"—the hexagram speaks of the advantage of establishing lords in terms of affairs, while the lines speak of the advantage of establishing lords in terms of persons. Cai Jiefu said: A girl, once betrothed, is given a courtesy name upon ascending; a man is given a courtesy name upon his capping.\n\nYang Tingxiu said: The third line, possessing a firm and luminous talent yet dwelling in *Zhen* (Thunder), reaches the extreme of movement—recklessly aspiring to achieve the merit of resolving *Zhun* (Difficulty). This is what is meant by \"pursuing the deer.\" Acting recklessly and responding to the primal above is what is meant by \"primal miscalculation.\" Master Su [Dongpo] said: In *Zhun*, the primal and the upright are the masters, yet only those who humble themselves win the people. The third line, though endowed with primal virtue, harbors a desire to seek the people—this is like miscalculating and pursuing the deer. The deer cannot be tamed by virtue, and one only labors in vain by entering the forest. He further said: The third line has no proper correspondence, and the fifth is unworthy of allegiance. Not recognizing the fifth’s unworthiness, deluded by proximity, why not sooner attach oneself to the first nine? Thus, in exhaustion, one comes to weeping blood. Yu Zhongxiang said: The rains of *Kan* (Water) are called \"nourishing.\" As the *Book of Songs* says: \"The yin rains nourish it\"—this is its meaning. Wang Ji said: Heaven and Earth generate the myriad things. *Zhun* is the beginning of things’ generation, hence it follows *Qian* (Heaven) and *Kun* (Earth). When qi first intermingles yet remains unharmonious, it is called *Zhun*; when things first sprout yet remain curled, it is called *Zhun*; when the world is beset by many difficulties and not yet at peace, it is called *Zhun*. The noble one, observing the image of *Zhun*, weaves the affairs of the world to resolve its difficulties. This is the learning of the noble one in the primordial era, at the dawn of Heaven and Earth’s unfolding, who brings things to fruition and establishes order. Clouds above thunder: yin and yang first intermingle yet have not formed rain, hence it is *Zhun*. Clouds below thunder have already formed rain, hence it is *Jie* (Release). \"Weaving\" refers to the work of ordering silk. \"Warp\" (jing) is gathering the threads and separating them, like thunder’s self-gathering and dispersal. \"Woof\" (lun) is ordering the threads and uniting them, like clouds’ self-dispersal and coalescence. This is what is meant by \"weaving the great warp of the world.\"\n\nYang Jingzhong’s general principle of correspondence among the six lines:\nThe first and fourth correspond, the second and fifth correspond, the third and the top correspond. Why is this so? Because the hexagrams are doubled. Originally, there were only eight trigrams, each with three lines. When doubled, the fourth line of the upper trigram becomes the first of the lower trigram, the fifth line of the upper trigram becomes the second of the lower trigram, and the top line of the upper trigram becomes the top of the lower trigram. Only those of the same kind form the image of correspondence. Yet one yin and one yang correspond, while two yins do not correspond, nor do two yangs. Here, the third six and the top six are both yin, hence they lack the image of correspondence—and thus bear the image of \"pursuing the deer without miscalculation.\"\n\n*Kan* below, *Gen* above: *Meng* (Youthful Ignorance): Smooth progress. It is not I who seek the youthful ignorant—it is the youthful ignorant who seek me. The first divination is answered; repeated inquiries are an imposition, and impositions go unanswered. Favorable to be steadfast.\n\n*The Judgment* says: *Meng*—beneath the mountain lies peril, peril that halts: this is *Meng*. *Meng* leads to smooth progress, for one acts with timely moderation. It is not I who seek the youthful ignorant—it is the youthful ignorant who seek me: this is the resonance of aspirations. The first divination is answered, for there is firmness in the center. Repeated impositions are an imposition, and impositions go unanswered: this is the defilement of ignorance. Nurturing correctness in ignorance is the work of the sage.\n\n*The Image* says: Beneath the mountain, a spring emerges: this is *Meng*. The noble one, with resolute conduct, cultivates virtue.\n\nFirst six: Awakening ignorance. Favorable to employ punishments, to remove fetters and stocks. Proceeding brings regret.\n*The Image* says: Favorable to employ punishments, for this rectifies the law.\n\nNine two: Embracing ignorance brings good fortune. Taking a wife brings good fortune. The son is capable of managing the household.\n*The Image* says: The son is capable of managing the household, for firmness and softness meet.\n\nSix three: Do not take this woman; she sees a man of metal and loses herself, with no advantage anywhere.\n*The Image* says: Do not take this woman, for her conduct is not compliant.\n\nSix four: Beset by ignorance, regret.\n*The Image* says: The regret of being beset by ignorance arises from isolation and distance from substance.\n\nSix five: Youthful ignorance, good fortune.\n*The Image* says: The good fortune of youthful ignorance lies in compliance and deference.\n\nTop nine: Striking ignorance. Unfavorable to act as a bandit; favorable to resist bandits.\n*The Image* says: Favorable to resist bandits, for above and below are compliant.\n\nMountain and Water: *Meng*—beneath the mountain lies peril, peril that halts.\n\nWhen it first halts, all is murky and undifferentiated, with no knowing where it goes. Thus is youthful ignorance; thus too is the sage. Though one might wish not to halt, how could it be otherwise? Hence it is said: Beneath the mountain lies peril, peril that halts—*Meng*. Yet if peril brings halting, then passage must come with smooth flow. And when it flows, the steadfast person is thus, and youthful ignorance is thus. Though one might wish not to proceed, how could it be otherwise? Hence it is said: *Meng*—smooth passage. To proceed with smoothness is to act in timely accord. To halt when the time is to halt, to proceed when the time is to proceed—this is precisely what it means to act in timely accord. The sage and the ignorant are not fundamentally different. Yet ignorance is the true nature of humanity; to nurture ignorance is thus to nurture correctness and to engage in the substantive work of sage-making. Hence it is said: *Meng* nurtures correctness—this is the work of the sage, and thus it is favorable and upright.\n\nIt is not I who seek the youthfully ignorant, but the youthfully ignorant who seek me—this speaks of my resonance with the fifth line’s intent, so the fifth naturally seeks me, not that I seek to instruct. Youthful ignorance is fundamentally without excess; I merely comply and encompass it, and that is sufficient. What does it seek, and what do I have to tell it?\n\nThe first divination is answered because the first six, just stepping out the door, casts the stalks and obtains the second line, drawing near to it to seek instruction. Hence it is said: \"by means of firmness and centrality.\" Yet if it comes a second time, or a third, one ultimately does not answer—this is not refusal to answer, but fear of spoiling the ignorant. Hence it is said: To spoil is not to answer, for it would drown the ignorant. Thus the first line’s \"favorable to punish,\" the third’s \"do not take this woman,\" and the fourth’s \"beset by regret\" all reflect this intent not to answer.\n\nAlas! Examine the *Xiang* commentary closely, and one will know the work of nurturing ignorance. If one repeatedly spoils it, this is striking ignorance, not nurturing it—this is acting as a bandit, not halting bandits. Only the top nine, who should halt at *Gen*’s stillness yet do not know to halt, would do this. How could the nine of the second line, who encompasses ignorance, act thus? If one aids it in halting bandits, then all below comply; if one acts as a bandit, then one above is already noncompliant—how could one make above and below all comply and achieve the utmost in great compliance?\n\nAlas! Without compliance in ignorance, how can one become a sage? Without compliant nurturing, how can one nurture correctness? Thus the sage uses this to comply with all under heaven, and through earnest reverence, all under heaven is pacified—without need for reward, the people are encouraged.\n\nNow observe its striking: the first line’s words say, \"Do not divine to seek my instruction,\" for I wish to dispel your ignorance—this is self-imposed constraint, urgently requiring correction. The method uses words to remove the constraint; only then can the constraint be undone. Otherwise, I fear that proceeding will bring regret, and one will cling to it all the more, making it impossible to remove. Have you not seen the fourth six? Originally an honest person, yet it deems itself unworthy and distances itself; originally ignorant, yet it deems itself unworthy and calls it heavenly constraint. If it already takes ignorance as constraint, how can its regret be undone?\n\nThe fifth six, yielding and compliant, dwelling centrally, is but a youthfully ignorant one. If taken as a wife, she is the wife of youthful ignorance; if taken as a son, he is the son who manages the household in youthful ignorance, where firmness and softness meet. There is nowhere it does not bring good fortune—only when the second nine’s encompassing of ignorance brings good fortune does the fifth six’s youthful ignorance achieve good fortune, and afterward the fifth six, with its own youthful ignorance, compliantly and deferentially enters the second nine’s encompassing of ignorance. Thus the second’s fundamental \"not advantageous\" is fitting, like the third six—she is not a woman one can take, but an untakable woman. This woman’s knowledge is greatly opened, and her conduct is no longer compliant with ignorance. What advantage is there for youthful ignorance?\n\nGenerally, the ignorant of the world, with their growing intelligence and broadening vision, often see gold yet fail to see themselves. Thus those who hear one and know ten are deemed greatly worthy, while those who engage in trade for a day are deemed empty fools, and those who are repeatedly empty are deemed mere beggars. They take themselves to be beset by hardship and unable to emerge. If one spoils them once, they rejoice; if one strikes them, they rejoice; if one imposes constraints, they rejoice again—where can the work of nurturing correctness be applied?\n\nWang Benhe says: After *Qian* and *Kun* come *Zhun* and *Meng*. *Zhun* is the initial unfolding of the times, when the world is ignorant, and the sage’s way of revolving *Qian* and turning *Kun* begins here. In *Meng*, knowledge has not yet spread, and the human heart is beset by difficulty—the sage’s work of opening heaven and cleaving earth begins here. *Zhun* is the world’s ignorance; *Meng* is humanity’s *Zhun*. Thus *Zhun* establishes lords, while *Meng* is favorable for resisting bandits.\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Fusi says: Nothing is clearer than the sage; nothing is more obscure than ignorance. To nurture correctness through ignorance is the work of the sage. Yet to nurture correctness through clarity is to lose the Way.\n\nProgram Zhengshu says: *Gen* is the mountain, signifying stillness. *Kan* is water, signifying peril. With peril beneath the mountain, one halts after surmounting danger, yet knows not where to go—this is the image of *Meng*.\n\nYou Dingfu says: A spring issues from beneath the mountain, its flow yet undispersed, its force not yet fully manifest. Observing its force’s unmanifested reach, one acts with resolve; observing its undispersed unity, one nurtures virtue.\n\nWang Ji says: A spring issuing from beneath the mountain is by nature still and clear—the source of water’s purity. Unconfined by east or west, unmuddied by silt and sand, guided by its singular flow, it naturally reaches the sea. The noble person models himself on *Meng*. The image shows resolute action nurturing one’s virtue. Water flows without ceasing, hence “resolute”; the mountain stands firm without yielding, hence “nurturing.” That undivided, unaroused unity is the essence of *Meng*. *Meng* is the foundation of sageliness. Yet from the meaning of *Meng*, worldly scholars fail to understand, mistaking it for obscurity. They recklessly strive to carve and dredge, fostering cunning and wit, muddying it with the desires of silt and sand, diverting it with the currents of east and west, thereby dissipating the integrity of undivided purity and obstructing the source of clarity and stillness. This not only brings no benefit but inflicts harm. The essence of sagely work lies entirely in *Meng*. In terms of heaven’s seasons, darkness is the mechanism of dawning clarity. In human affairs, obscurity is the prelude to illumination. Yet the world fails to perceive this. Mencius said: “The great person does not lose the heart of the infant.” The heart of the infant is precisely what is meant by *Meng*.\n\n*Kan* below, *Qian* above: *Xu*. With sincerity, radiant success; uprightness brings good fortune. Favorable for fording the great river.\n\n**The Image** says: *Xu* means “to await”; peril lies ahead. Firm and strong, one does not sink—thus one’s principle is not beset by exhaustion. *Xu*: with sincerity, radiant success, uprightness brings good fortune. Occupying heaven’s position, centered and correct. Favorable for fording the great river—advancing will bring achievement.\n\n**The Image** says: Clouds ascend above heaven—*Xu*. The noble person takes this as a model for feasting and rejoicing.\n\n**First Nine**: Awaiting at the outskirts. Favorable to persist; no blame.\n**The Image** says: Awaiting at the outskirts—one does not rashly advance into difficulty. Favorable to persist; no blame—one has not lost constancy.\n\n**Nine in the Second**: Awaiting on the sands. Minor words arise, but in the end, good fortune.\n**The Image** says: Awaiting on the sands—one’s breadth lies in the center. Though minor words arise, the end is good.\n\n**Nine in the Third**: Awaiting in the mire—this brings raiders to arrive.\n**The Image** says: Awaiting in the mire—disaster lies without. One brings raiders upon oneself; reverent caution averts defeat.\n\n**Six in the Fourth**: Awaiting in blood—emerging from the cave.\n**The Image** says: Awaiting in blood—submissive and heeding.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth**: Awaiting with wine and food—uprightness brings good fortune.\n**The Image** says: Wine and food, uprightness brings good fortune—through central correctness.\n\n**Top Six**: Entering the cave—three uninvited guests arrive. Treat them with reverence; in the end, good fortune.\n**The Image** says: Uninvited guests arrive—treat them with reverence; in the end, good fortune. Though not in the proper position, no great loss occurs.\n\n*Water over Heaven: Xu*\n\nThe talent of unyielding strength finds no difficulty in overcoming peril, yet struggles not to court it. At first, having stepped beyond the gate and awaited at the outskirts, one must not rush forward—I know they will not breach the gate of peril. Yet I fear they may lack endurance, lose their steadfast heart, and though they court peril, disregard it entirely. Thus, it is said: \"Through constancy in action, no blame.\" **Nine in the Second** awaits near danger, resembling one who waits upon the sands. Though sand is not water, it is where water must inevitably flow; thus, to await upon the sands is akin to moving through the midst of water. With the Second’s resolute and luminous talent, centered in its position, though it hears minor grumblings on all sides, it attains ultimate good fortune and preserves it to the end.\n\n**Nine in the Third**, encountering rigidity, finds no rest upon the sands and instead awaits only to sink into the mire. The mire ensnares one far more deeply than sand—how could this not be considered? Yet the Third knows only that water cannot bring disaster, unaware that peril lies without. Once mired, it cannot advance in joy nor retreat at will—raiders arrive. Who, if not oneself, has summoned them? This stems from insufficient foresight, careless awaiting, and the fault of excessive rigidity. Yet by virtue of its strength, if it humbly redoubles its reverent caution, it will surely not fail. Though not failing is good, how much better to have never reached the mire at all. Thus, when danger lies ahead and one cannot await, even the unyielding strength of Qian cannot escape entrapment or exhaustion. How much more so for the yielding **Six in the Fourth** and the **Top Six**?\n\nNow, **Six in the Fourth** dwells beneath the abyss, its image one of awaiting while wounded—seemingly unable to emerge. Yet it escapes the pit’s depths by submitting and heeding. **Nine in the Fifth** would rather endure injury than rush forward—this is the power of central correctness. **Top Six**, positioned above the abyss, nearly exits its confines, yet instead of awaiting, it retreats into the pit’s depths—is this not extreme? Thus, it is told: though you have entered the cave, you are fortunate that three uninvited guests arrive. For **Nine in the Third**, corresponding to the Top, is the Top’s guest. Now, the Third, through reverent caution, has escaped peril and comes forth. If you treat them with reverence, you may yet secure ultimate good fortune. Though you have entered the cave, what harm is there? Yet while the Top is fortunate in the Third’s arrival, it is also heeding the **Nine in the Fifth**’s warning.\n\nFrom this, I observe: the yielding fear they cannot emerge, while the firm fear they cannot await. In this hexagram of *Xu*, the Sage speaks especially to those of firm strength. \"Through constancy in action\" serves as a warning to all. \"Minor grumblings\" serve as a warning to the Second. \"Summoning raiders\" serves as a warning to the Third. Who is warned to await with sincerity, radiance, prosperity, uprightness, and good fortune? It is **Nine in the Fifth**, enthroned in the celestial position, who may ford great rivers and advance to achieve merit. For the Fifth, though dwelling in inquiry, forgets its peril and awaits only with wine and food—much like one in *Kun*. **Nine in the Second**, though situated in distress, forgets its distress and knows only to be content with wine and food. This is the supreme virtue and essential path of awaiting in *Xu* and enduring in *Kun*. Thus, it is said: \"Uprightness brings good fortune,\" and again: \"Through central correctness, it is supremely so.\"\n\nAlas! To remain still and await, not even venturing beyond the outskirts with food and drink—how much less should one reach the mire? Liu Yongxiang says: The three guests are **Nine in the Third**. Though the Third does not occupy the Fifth’s position, it is firm and strong; treating it with reverence incurs no great loss. In this hexagram, only **Six in the Fourth** can submit and heed, while the others—**Nine in the Fifth** and the rest—bear the image of Qian’s unyielding vigor and overbearing force, unable to await or heed. Were it not for the Fifth’s celestial position, its central correctness, and its repeated, earnest admonitions, they would not await. This is why the Fifth is radiant and prosperous.\n\n**Appendix**\nJin Rubai says: The Fourth and Top, both yin lines within *Kan*, thus both speak of the cave—just as in the *Kan* hexagram, the initial and third lines both form *Kan*.\nWang Ji says: Qian’s unyielding strength, when advancing and encountering peril, does not rush forward—thus *Xu* holds the path to prosperity. If one awaits with a yielding and weak nature, delaying without progress, then awaiting becomes a burden of affairs.\nThe *Shuowen* states: *Xu* (await) derives from *ye* (page, head) and *shan* (ornament, hair); originally referring to the beard, it is borrowed for the sense of \"that which is needed.\"\nFang Shihua says: The Master used this to explain *Xu*, meaning to await **Nine in the Fifth**.\n\n---\n**Water over Heaven: Song**\n*Song*: Sincerity obstructed, caution—central good fortune, ultimate misfortune. Favorable to see the great person; unfavorable to ford great rivers.\n**The Judgment** says: *Song* arises from rigidity above and peril below—peril and strength contend. *Song* with sincerity obstructed, caution, and central good fortune: strength comes and attains the center. Ultimate misfortune: contention cannot be completed. Favorable to see the great person: esteeming central correctness. Unfavorable to ford great rivers: entering the abyss.\n**The Image** says: Heaven and water move in opposition—*Song*. The noble person, in undertaking affairs, plans from the beginning.\n\n**Initial Six**: Does not prolong the affair; minor grumblings, ultimate good fortune.\n**The Image** says: Does not prolong the affair—contention cannot be long. Though minor grumblings arise, its clarity prevails.\n\n**Nine in the Second**: Does not prevail in contention; retreats and flees—his village of three hundred households remains unharmed.\n**The Image** says: Does not prevail in contention—retreating and fleeing. Contending from below against above brings calamity upon oneself.\n\n**Six in the Third**: Feeds on old virtue; uprightness is perilous, ultimate good fortune. If following royal affairs, no achievement.\n**The Image** says: Feeds on old virtue—following above brings good fortune.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth**: Does not prevail in contention; returns to the mandate, changes, and finds peace in uprightness—good fortune.\n\n**The Image** says: Returns to the mandate, changes, and finds peace in uprightness—nothing is lost.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth**: Contention brings supreme good fortune.\n**The Image** says: Contention brings supreme good fortune—through central correctness.\n\n**Top Nine**: Perhaps granted a leather belt, yet by day’s end it is thrice stripped away.\n**The Image** says: Receiving robes through contention is hardly worthy of respect.\n\n**Heaven and Water in Contention**\nFang Shihua says: This hexagram combines superior firmness with inferior peril, peril yet strength. Without peril, contention cannot arise; without strength, contention cannot be sustained. Only peril paired with strength brings contention to fruition. Yet can contention truly be achieved? Can it truly endure? Can it persist long enough to follow royal affairs, prolonging the affair indefinitely? Fortunately, the central and correct Nine in the Fifth, a noble person, seeks to eliminate contention entirely, offering those who contend what they truly desire to see. And Nine in the Second, firm yet yielding to the center, ensures that contention fails of itself—it cannot endure, cannot persist, cannot drag on, and ultimately sinks into the abyss. For yang is solid while yin is hollow; firmness yielding to the center embodies trust and clarity. Yet a single yang trapped within yin, peril, obstruction, and trepidation is all too evident. Obstruction gives rise to contention; trepidation ensures it does not endure—how much more so when Nine in the Fifth appears? Thus, at the first sight of Nine in the Fifth, shame and remorse leave no room for delay: contention fails, retreat and flight follow, as is fitting.\n\nIs not the Second the master of peril? All within its inner trigram are those it ordinarily commands. Once it contends with the Fifth, great contention erupts, and the implicated multiply. Yet if it retreats and flees, the three hundred households of its village will surely escape disaster—such is the Second’s refusal to prolong contention. As for the Initial and Fourth, neither wishes to prolong contention. The Third, too, does not seek contention, though it fears provocation may lead to following royal affairs. Thus, when circumstances align, a leather belt may be granted, and the Top, too, fails in contention. All five lines thus benefit from the presence of Nine in the Fifth, and contention ultimately ceases. How supreme is the Fifth’s supreme good fortune through central correctness! Hence it is said: “In hearing contention, I am no different from others—what I must do is eliminate contention altogether.” This describes Nine in the Fifth. Thus, the Fifth line speaks only of “contention bringing supreme good fortune,” not of “hearing contention,” for supreme good fortune is its essence. Even if one hears contention well, how can it bring supreme good fortune?\n\nFrom today’s perspective: the Initial, yielding and dwelling below, rests in softness, does not prolong the affair, and though minor grumblings arise, clarity prevails and contention ceases. Its good fortune in not prolonging contention is fitting. The Fourth and Fifth share the same body, benefiting from the presence of Nine in the Fifth, returning to the mandate, changing, and finding peace in uprightness—uniquely preserving the Fifth’s earnest desire to avoid contention. Its good fortune in not prolonging contention is especially fitting. Though the Top is excessively firm and dwells above, the Third feeds on old virtue, perilous at first but ultimately fortunate. Alas! The granting of the leather belt, the thrice-stripped shame—one may say the Top, too, does not prolong contention. Why? Because it still retains a sense of shame.\n\nFearing it might reveal its original countenance before the Nine in the Fifth.\n\n**Appendix**\nYang Zhongli says: The heavens rotate leftward while water flows eastward—this is contrary movement. When affairs reach the point of contrary movement before one deliberates, excess has already taken hold.\n\nWang Ji says: Heaven is the beginning of the Three Powers; water is the beginning of the Five Phases. The noble person models himself upon them in acting and planning at the outset. In all matters, there is a beginning, a middle, and an end—contention in the middle brings good fortune, but contention at the end brings misfortune. If one can plan at the outset to sever contention, then the proper course in the middle and end need not be spoken of.\n\nHe also says: Observing the image of heaven and water moving in contrary directions—heaven’s leftward rotation and the five planets’ rightward revolution—this is further confirmed.\n\n**Hexagram 7: 师 (Shi / The Army)**\n**Judgment:** *Uprightness. The elder brings good fortune; there is no blame.*\n**The Tuan (#35) says:** The army is the multitude. Uprightness is correctness. To be able to correct the multitude is to be fit to rule. Firmness in the center with resonance, advancing through peril yet in accord—using this to administer the world, the people follow. What blame could there be in good fortune?\n**The Xiang says:** Water within the earth—this is *The Army*. The noble person thereby contains the people and nurtures the multitude.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Six:** The army marches by discipline; if not good, there is misfortune.\n**The Xiang says:** The army marches by discipline—losing discipline brings misfortune.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** In the army, centeredness brings good fortune and no blame; the king thrice bestows command.\n**The Xiang says:** In the army, centeredness brings good fortune—it receives the favor of heaven. The king thrice bestows command, cherishing the myriad states.\n\n**Six in the Third:** The army may bear corpses in its chariots—misfortune.\n**The Xiang says:** The army may bear corpses in its chariots—great excess in achievement.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** The army retreats to the left—no blame.\n**The Xiang says:** Retreating to the left incurs no blame—it does not lose constancy.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** There are creatures in the fields; it is beneficial to seize them. No blame. The eldest son leads the army; the younger son bears corpses—uprightness brings misfortune.\n**The Xiang says:** The eldest son leads the army—he acts with centeredness. The younger son bears corpses—his appointment is improper.\n\n**Top Six:** The great lord issues a command, enfeoffing and establishing a house. The petty man must not be employed.\n**The Xiang says:** The great lord issues a command—to rightly reward merit. The petty man must not be employed, for he will surely disorder the state.\n\n**Hexagram 8: 比 (Bi / Alliance)**\nWater clings to earth—this is *Alliance*. Seeking security through attachment is impossible without the firm centeredness of the Nine in the Fifth.\n\nWater within the earth is *The Army*. The army is the multitude, yet to correct the multitude is impossible without the firm centeredness of the Nine in the Second. Thus, the hexagram takes the Nine in the Second as the elder. Only by obtaining the elder and entrusting him exclusively can one achieve good fortune without blame. How true this is! The difficulty of employing the multitude lies in correcting it. To correct the multitude is to be fit to rule the world. Thus it says: *Uprightness is correctness.* What is uprightness? \"There are creatures in the fields; it is beneficial to seize them.\" To employ them with justification—this is what is meant by uprightness. Using the multitude in this way is to employ them to rightly govern the state, to enfeoff and establish a house, to pacify and cherish the people—what else could this be if not uprightness? Thus, using this to administer the people, the people follow, for it is upright.\n\nYet if one does not know the way of exclusive entrustment, even with the elder of the Nine in the Second, achieving merit will be difficult. This is what is meant by sending the eldest son to lead the army while also dispatching the younger son to bear corpses. In such a case, even uprightness brings misfortune, and ultimate defeat and disorder are inevitable. How could one hope for good fortune and no blame? What use is uprightness then? Truly, the difficulty of the army lies in correcting the multitude. The difficulty of correcting the multitude lies in obtaining the elder. Yet obtaining the elder is difficult, and being able to employ the elder is even more difficult.\n\nNow, the Nine in the Second, dwelling below and centered, is precisely the elder’s selection, and the Six in the Fifth responds to him—it is not that the latter cannot employ him. The concern is that there may be divided loyalties, and his employment may not be exclusive. Thus, the Initial Six, upon stepping out the door, is immediately warned against losing discipline: the army’s discipline and commands issue solely from the eldest son; no other may usurp authority. If the Initial Six dares to usurp, it is a loss of discipline. Losing discipline—even if good, there is misfortune; how much worse if not good? Goodness is uprightness.\n\nNow, the Six in the Fifth, able to regard the Second as the eldest son and thrice bestow command upon him, and the Second, in turn, achieves good fortune in the center of the army and receives the favor of heaven’s bestowal—yet the Initial Six cannot escape the warning of discipline, the Six in the Third cannot avoid the suspicion of bearing corpses, and the Six in the Fifth cannot prevent the dispatch of the younger son and the employment of petty men. The body of Kun is yielding and compliant, and this is to be feared.\n\nOnly the Six in the Fourth, attaining correctness, serves as a deputy general stationed to the left, able to retreat and await command. Thus it says: \"The army may bear corpses in its chariots—great excess in achievement.\" The great refers to unity. If corpses are borne in chariots, greatness achieves no merit. How could the Six in the Fifth still dispatch the younger son to inquire? Thus, in the top line, it is reiterated: The great lord commands the general to lead the army, originally for the purpose of enfeoffment and establishing a house, employing them to pacify and cherish the myriad states—petty men must not be involved. Involving petty men will surely disorder the state.\n\nFor the Nine in the Second is yang firmness, the eldest son, the elder; the Initial and Third are yin softness. The soft are younger sons; younger sons should only be made to heed the commands of the eldest son. The yin are petty men; petty men should only be made to heed the commands of the elder. How could one employ the words of petty men or let the younger sons take charge of affairs? Alas! For a thousand years after, worthy generals who could not exercise exclusive authority met with disaster and defeat—this was invariably the cause.\n\nIn the Tang dynasty, when Yu Chao’en was made *Observer of the Army*, even Li Guangbi, the hero of Linhuai for the ages, and Guo Ziyi, the greatest figure of his time, could not avoid losing armies and discipline. Emperor Daizong, though he had shared hardships with them and together they had recovered the two capitals, ultimately trusted and employed petty men, forcing the emperor to flee once more to Shaan—this was no other reason than that he was yielding and easily swayed, truly like the Six in the Fifth of this hexagram.\n\nThe Sage’s earnest admonitions are indeed fitting as warnings.\n\n**Appendix: Master Po’s Exegesis**\nThe *Elder* is what the *Odes* calls “a man of seasoned virtue.” Duke Mu of Zhai said: “The former kings radiated virtue and did not parade their armies.” For armies, when sheathed, must move in due season—once in motion, they display might; once displayed, they become a spectacle; once a spectacle, they fail to strike awe. Thus, “water lies within the earth.” When armies are spoken of, they should flow like water beneath the earth, unseen by men.\n\nLiu Yongxiang said: “The second and fifth lines correspond, so the conferral of mandate is evident. Only after the fourth line aligns with the third can the second and third lines’ conferral be discerned.” The *Disciples* are none other than *petty men*—there are not two kinds.\n\nXiong Guo said: “The *Army* hexagram has one yang line leading five yin lines, for in ancient times five men formed a squad, five squads a platoon, five platoons a company, and five companies a battalion—all reckoned from the number five.” *A cartload of corpses*: Master Cheng interprets this as “the masses acting as the master.” According to ancient usage, *yú lùn* (public opinion) and *yú rén zhī sòng* (the people’s songs) both refer to the multitude. The *Odes* say: “Who is the master of this?”—*shī* (master) here means *to preside over*.\n\nYang Jingzhong said: “Water flowing beneath the earth, if there is something to contain it, accumulates and embodies the image of a gathered army. Without containment, it does not gather—precisely because there is originally something to hold it.” *The Yi’s Upper Canon, Scroll One concludes.* #1 (This heading was absent in the original and has been added by the editor.)\n\nHereafter, instances of similar textual variants shall not be annotated. #2 The character *tuàn* (彖) originally appeared as *xiàng* (象) and has been emended following the received *Zhouyi*. #3 According to the received *Zhouyi*, the phrase “不见是而无闷” follows this sentence. #4 The character *fū* (夫) originally appeared as *tiān* (天) and has been emended following the received *Zhouyi*. #5 The character *tiān* (天) appears as *dà* (大) in the Jigu Ge edition. #6 The name *Zhuāng Shēng* (庄生) appears as *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) in the Jigu Ge edition. #7 The character *dì* (地) appears as *qì* (气) in the Jigu Ge edition. #8 The character *yīn* (因) appears as *kùn* (困) in the Jigu Ge edition. #9 The character *rì* (日) appears as *jiù* (臼) in the Jigu Ge edition. #10 The character *zhī* (之) appears as *yǐ* (以) in the received *Zhouyi*. #11 The character *hài* (害) appears as *qióng* (穷) in the received *Zhouyi*. #12 The character *rén* (人) appears as *fū* (夫) in the Jigu Ge edition. #13 The character *zài* (载) appears as *chéng* (成) in the Jigu Ge edition. #14 The character *dǎ* (打) appears as *hé* (何) in the Jigu Ge edition. #15 The character *nǚ* (女) appears as *ān* (安) in the Jigu Ge edition. #16 The character *céng* (层) appears as *hòu* (厚) in the Jigu Ge edition. #17 The character *zhì* (志) appears as *zhǔ* (主) in the Jigu Ge edition. #18 The character *lái* (来) appears as *qiú* (求) in the Jibu Ge edition. #19 The character *luó* (罗) appears as *jù* (惧) in the Jigu Ge edition. #20 The character *fēi* (非) appears as *suī* (虽) in the Jigu Ge edition. #21 The character *wú* (无) should be *xiān* (先), emended according to the context. #22 The character *yǐ* (以) appears as *hé* (合) in the Jigu Ge edition. #23 The sequence *kǎn xià gèn shàng* (坎下艮上) originally appeared as *kǎn shàng gèn xià* (坎上艮下) and has been emended according to the structure of the hexagram. #24 Following the character *zhī* (之), the received *Zhouyi* includes the character *lìn* (吝). #25 The character *jí* (即) should be *shí* (时), emended according to the context. #26 The character *wèi* (未) appears as *wèi* (谓) in the Jigu Ge edition. #27 The character *shī* (施) appears as *shòu* (受) in the Jigu Ge edition. #28 Following *jiè* (戒), the character *èr* (二) appears to be missing. #29 The character *wèn* (问) appears as *xiǎn* (险) in the Jigu Ge edition. #30 The character *jí* (吉) originally appeared as *gào* (告) and has been emended following the Jigu Ge edition. #31 The character *èr* (二) originally appeared as *yī* (一) and has been emended following the Jibu Ge edition. #32 The character *shān* (彡) originally appeared as *duō* (多) and has been emended following the Jigu Ge edition. #33 The character *qí* (其) originally appeared as *bīng* (兵) and has been emended following the received *Zhouyi*. #34 The character *jí* (吉) originally appeared as *gǔ* (古) and has been emended according to the context. #35 The character *tuàn* (彖) originally appeared as *xiàng* (象) and has been emended following the received *Zhouyi*. #36 The character *gǒng* (巩) originally appeared as *xiàng* (象) and has been emended following the received *Zhouyi*. #37 The character *yī* (一) appears as *èr* (二) in the Jigu Ge edition.\n\n*The Yi’s Upper Canon, Scroll Two*\n\n**Hexagram 8: Bǐ (比) – Union**\n*Below Kǎn (坎), above Kūn (坤)*\n**Union: Auspicious.**\n*Original divination: Primordial, enduring, and steadfast—no blame.*\n*Disquiet approaches; the latecomer meets misfortune.*\n\n**Tuàn (Judgment) says:**\nUnion is auspicious.\nUnion means assistance; the lower follows in compliance.\n*Original divination: Primordial, enduring, and steadfast—no blame,*\nbecause of firmness in the center.\n*Disquiet approaches,*\nas superiors and inferiors respond to one another.\n*The latecomer meets misfortune,*\nfor his Dao is exhausted.\n\n**Xiàng (Image) says:**\nWater upon the earth—*Bǐ* (Union).\nThe former kings, by this, established the myriad states and befriended the feudal lords.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Six:**\nUnion with sincerity—no blame.\nSincerity fills the vessel; in the end, there comes another auspice—good fortune.\n**Xiàng says:**\nThe initial six in *Bǐ* (Union) brings another auspice—good fortune.\n\n**Six in the Second:**\nUnion from within—steadfast and auspicious.\n**Xiàng says:**\nUnion from within—one does not lose oneself.\n\n**Six in the Third:**\nUnion with the unworthy.\n**Xiàng says:**\nUnion with the unworthy—is this not grievous?\n\n**Six in the Fourth:**\nExternal union—steadfast and auspicious.\n**Xiàng says:**\nExternal union with the worthy—thus following the superior.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:**\nManifest union.

Naturally, it may unite without blame. Thus, the Six in the Second, not losing itself within, divines again and, upon obtaining this, proceeds to unite—hence it is steadfast, auspicious, and free from blame. This is what is meant by *finding where one unites and thus being at peace*—precisely the meaning of *not losing the one and the five*.\nThe Six in the Fourth shares the same body with the Fifth and externally unites with it—befriending the virtuous, serving the worthy, following the superior, seeking peace—steadfast and auspicious, as is fitting. The Initial Six, occupying the first position as yin, truly responds to the primordial and correct, and its disquiet must yield to sincerity. Only then does it attain its proper union and incur no blame. Moreover, situated at the base of the earthly *Kūn*, water must fill it, presenting the image of sincerity filling the vessel. Since sincerity is already full, the good fortune of the Six in the Fourth ultimately comes to it—how could this be merely a matter of no blame?\n\nThus, if disquiet can be rectified and alignment drawn near, then in the end, even severed ties may yet yield other auspices. Hence it is said: \"Disquiet rectified draws near\"—above and below respond to one another. The \"above\" refers to the Fourth; the \"below\" refers to the Initial. For the Nine in the Fifth, firm and central in its correctness, is the true king, now manifestly befriended and aligned by all. Should any remain unaligned, the method of the threefold drive is employed to draw them in, yet the forward quarry may be lost—this is not a matter of insistence. Such is merely the king’s intent; how could the people of the domain know it? Without command or admonition, they are left to their own alignment, nor are they driven forward—yet the center above truly enables this. The king’s impartiality, in this way, becomes manifest and universally trusted. Thus the lower positions contend to align, and good fortune is assured.\n\nYet is not the Six in the Upper precisely the loss of the forward quarry? If the Three, instead of aligning with the Five, aligns with the Six, is this not the harm of associating with the unworthy? Therefore, the Initial Six and the Six in the Second do not join the Three in the selection of the threefold drive. The people of the domain, without command or admonition, choose compliance and reject opposition, aligning with the primal and maintaining steadfast correctness—this is how it must be. The Six in the Upper, at the apex of alignment, still clings to the primal chief as its match—how dire the misfortune! Truly, I know not how it will end. For when it stands before the Five, it is said, \"the forward quarry is lost\"; when it clings to the primal chief as its match, unaware of aligning with the Five, it is said, \"the latter will meet with misfortune.\"\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Fusi says: The upper and lower yang positions divide the people, yet the Five alone abides in honor, and all turn toward it. Above and below respond to it, exalted and at peace. Peace draws the disquieted to shelter, hence \"disquiet rectified draws near\"—above and below respond. The primal seeks those who possess; it does not seek those who endanger, but those who bring peace. It does not seek those who withdraw, for fire has its flame, and the cold draw near—thus, if one is at peace, the disquieted will draw near. Peace, honor, harmony, and kinship, yet lingering behind—this is why punishment brings misfortune.\n\nMaster Su of the Eastern Slope says: Alignment brings good fortune. No alignment is without good fortune, yet aligning with the wrong person, though presently fortunate, will later incur blame. Hence it is said, \"divine again\"—divine whom to follow. \"Divine again\" means to divine twice, the height of caution.\n\nZhao Ruqi says: Alignment does not consider correspondence but focuses solely on aligning with the Five.\n\nBan Mengjian says: \"Quarry\" is the general term for birds and beasts, those captured and controlled by humans.\n\nBu Zixia says: Primal sincerity in attachment, when the Dao is exhausted and alignment follows, execution will ensue. How could it end otherwise?\n\n**Hexagram 9: Small Taming (小畜 Xiǎo Chù): Prospering.**\n*Dense clouds, no rain—from our western suburbs.*\n\n**The Judgment (彖传 Tuànzhuàn) says:**\n\"Small Taming\": the yielding attains its position, and above and below respond to it—thus \"Small Taming.\" Vigorous yet yielding, firm in the center with its will enacted—thereby prospering. *Dense clouds, no rain*—still advancing. *From our western suburbs*—the bestowal has not yet taken effect.\n\n**The Image (象传 Xiàngzhuàn) says:**\nWind moving above heaven: *Small Taming*. The noble one refines his cultural virtue.\n\n**Line 1 (初九 Chū jiǔ):**\nReturning by one’s own path—what blame could there be? Auspicious.\n**The Image says:**\nReturning by one’s own path—its principle is auspicious.\n\n**Line 2 (九二 Jiǔ èr):**\nDrawn back to return—auspicious.\n**The Image says:**\nDrawn back to return, centered—it does not lose itself.\n\n**Line 3 (九三 Jiǔ sān):**\nThe cart sheds its spokes; husband and wife glare at each other.\n**The Image says:**\nHusband and wife glare at each other—unable to rectify the household.\n\n**Line 4 (六四 Liù sì):**\nPossessing sincerity, bloodshed departs and fear emerges—no blame.\n**The Image says:**\nPossessing sincerity, fear emerges—above, it aligns with the will.\n\n**Line 5 (九五 Jiǔ wǔ):**\nPossessing sincerity, bound as twins—enriching with one’s neighbors.\n**The Image says:**\nPossessing sincerity, bound as twins—it does not enrich alone.\n\n**Line 6 (上九 Shàng jiǔ):**\nThe rain has fallen, the matter is settled—still, virtue bears the load. The wife’s steadfastness is perilous; the moon nears fullness. For the noble one, advancing brings misfortune.\n**The Image says:**\nThe rain has fallen, the matter is settled—virtue accumulates and bears the load. For the noble one, advancing brings misfortune—there is cause for doubt.\n\n**Fāng Shíhuà’s Commentary on *Wind Above Heaven: Small Taming*:**\nThe hexagram is named *Small Taming* because the single yin line at the fourth position, as the yielding ruler of Xùn, has attained its proper place. Moreover, it resides above Qián, vigorous yet yielding. Thus, the ninth line above (Nine Five) responds to the first line below (Initial Nine), while Nine Two also responds above. All below respond to the fourth line, each willing to be tamed by it—hence *Small Taming*. Though the single yin of Six Four is small, it can tame the greatness of many yang lines. This must arise from more than mere vigor—it must act with vigor while practicing yielding. Here, the firm and centered Five alone can extend sincere trust, achieving the twin-like sincerity that allows Six Four’s will to be enacted, and the Dao of taming to prosper. Furthermore, Initial Nine corresponds with Four—returning to Four is returning by one’s own path. Nine Two is adjacent to Initial Nine; Initial Nine responds to Four, and Nine Two is drawn to Initial Nine—this is *drawn back to return*. Yet without Nine Five first responding to it, how could Four fulfill its will, and how would the many yang lines willingly submit to its taming? The two lines about *dense clouds* depict the scene of rising clouds and impending rain, expressing delight in its taming. The tradition says *the bestowal has not yet taken effect*—this precisely describes the process of taming. But *not yet taken effect* does not mean it will never take effect.\n\nSix Four, being firm yet yielding, can thus employ a person of sincere substance to manifest the vigilance of Qian, casting aside its blood and directly entering through yielding. Thereby, Nine Five obtains the aid of its neighbor to enjoy its secure wealth and honored position—this is the depth of its trustworthiness. When Nine Three ascends to pair with Six Four, it forms the image of husband and wife, yet is excessively rigid and not centered. If Four regards it as a cheek to its jawbone, Three instead sheds its spokes, turns away in hostility, and pays no heed—how then can it govern the household and establish the family? This is the fault of Nine Three, not a flaw in Four.\n\nUpper Nine’s view of Nine Three differs. It does not recognize that Four’s Way of taming has already succeeded: formerly dense clouds, now rain has fallen. Formerly one longed for rain, now rain has come and the situation has shifted. Crops now stand in the fields, gathered into granaries, and virtue is fully borne. Four is yin, Five is yang. If Four is taken as the wife, she is steadfast and vigilant; Four is the fourth month, Five the fifth day. If Four is taken as the moon, it waxes toward fullness in mutual gaze—how is this not secure? If its taming does not share in governance but seeks separate validation, then Six Four’s capacity for taming need only join with others to fulfill its taming—no doubt is necessary.\n\nThat Upper Nine resists its taming stems merely from its suspicion, in Four’s yielding entry, that Four is not a true noble. Yet this Six Four of *Small Taming* is precisely firm yet yielding, capable of greatness, benefiting the state and greatly benefiting the ruler. Such was the great minister of old—what doubt could there be?\n\nWang’s edition records He’s note: “When yin doubts yang, it leads to bloody conflict, hence *Kun*’s Upper Six bears the wound of dark and yellow. When yin trusts yang, blood is dispelled, hence *Small Taming*’s Six Four is free from the burden of blood and qi.”\n\n**Appendix**\nYang Jian said: “Yi Yin’s treatment of Tai Jia was not initially smooth, but when Tai Jia suddenly awoke and sincerely reformed, Yi Yin’s will then came to fruition—thus it became smooth. If Heaven had not thundered greatly with wind to complete the transformation, and the king had not wept while holding the decree, the Duke of Zhou’s will could never have been called fulfilled, nor could *Small Taming*’s smoothness have been achieved. Six Four, utmost in softness and embodying yielding, tames the ruler with gentle compliance, so ruler and minister trust and harmonize, free from harm, free from fear, without blame. This is the natural image of yin and yang’s mutual accord.\n\nWhen ministers offer counsel to rulers, discord often arises because the minister has not eliminated self-interest—whether craving reputation, prizing personal victory, or failing to align with the ruler’s will. Thus discord emerges. The *Book of Documents* states: ‘If you have excellent plans or strategies, present them. Thereafter, attend to inner matters, then outwardly comply.’ It says: ‘These plans, these strategies belong to our lord alone.’ A virtuous minister tames the ruler in this way—how could discord arise?”\n\nThe *Image* says: “Above, the wills align”—how profound is this teaching!\n\nJin Rubai said: “Both Four and Five speak of having trust—this is mutual trust between the two lines. Four says ‘above, the wills align,’ meaning it aligns with Five. Four relies on Five to tame, while Qian’s Five entrusts Four and they trust one another.”\n\n**Hexagram 10: Lü (Treading)**\n*Below Dui, above Qian*\nTreading on a tiger’s tail—it does not bite the person. Smoothness.\n\n**Judgment:**\n*Treading* means the yielding treads upon the firm. Joyful and responsive to Qian, thus treading on a tiger’s tail without being bitten—smoothness. Firm, centered, and correct, treading the imperial position without distress—radiant clarity.\n\n**Image:**\nHeaven above, marsh below—*Treading*. The noble person thereby distinguishes above and below, settling the people’s will.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Nine:** Plain treading—going forth without blame.\n*Image:* Going forth with plain treading—acting alone on one’s aspiration.\n\n**Nine Two:** Treading a level path—secluded persons: steadfastness brings good fortune.\n*Image:* The secluded person’s steadfast good fortune—centered, not self-disordered.\n\n**Six Three:** Dim-sighted yet striving to see, lame yet striving to tread—treading on a tiger’s tail, it bites the person. Misfortune. A martial man acts as a great lord.\n*Image:* Dim-sighted yet striving to see—insufficient for clarity. Lame yet striving to tread—insufficient for movement. The misfortune of being bitten—position improper. A martial man acting as a great lord—will is rigid.\n\n**Nine Four:** Treading on a tiger’s tail—cautious, ultimately good fortune.\n*Image:* Cautious, ultimately good fortune—will is enacted.\n\n**Nine Five:** Decisive treading—steadfastness is perilous.\n*Image:* Decisive treading—steadfastness is perilous—position is correct and proper.\n\n**Upper Nine:** Contemplating one’s treading, examining the omens—its return is supremely auspicious.\n*Image:* Supreme auspiciousness above—great celebration.\n\n**Hexagram 10: Lü (Treading)**\nFang Shihua said: “Nine Five, with Qian’s firm virtue, occupies the supreme position. Those who tread behind it are joyful and responsive to Qian—what peril could there be? Yet the line uniquely speaks of decisiveness and perilous steadfastness, indicating a specific reference. Thus the *Image* directly names the hexagram with the three words ‘treading a tiger’s tail.’ It is as if treading a tiger’s tail and merely avoiding being bitten is already fortunate, yet the Master’s commentary focuses on the yielding treading the firm, joy responding to Qian, and its firmness, centrality, and correctness—treading the imperial position without distress, so radiantly clear. This further reveals that with Qian above and Dui below, there is absolutely no cause for concern. The intent is to display its virtue through this hexagram, differing from King Wen’s *Appended Judgments*.\n\nSix Three is neither centered nor correct, its will rigid and vision dim—hence its image. King Wen’s meaning is that when ministers serve rulers, there is always the peril of treading on a tiger. Treading requires seeing with the eyes. Now Six Three is blind and cannot see—how could it not be bitten by Initial Nine? At the bottom of the hexagram, just stepping out the door already fears treading on a tiger, yet it can tread plainly and go forth, acting alone on its aspiration—its foresight is early indeed.”\n\nAt the bottom, in the initial position, this is its plainness—hence it is called \"plain treading.\" Nine Two, however, sees the path of treading as vast indeed. Though a reclusive person may also be steadfast and auspicious, why must one seek resonance with the fifth to tread upon its tail, spending the whole day in anxious dread, disturbing one’s centeredness? This too is one who sees in advance, avoids perilous conduct—an ancient noble scholar.\n\nFour occupies the position of a great minister, near Nine Five, and cannot but tread upon the tiger’s tail. Yet by recognizing it as a tiger and remaining in anxious dread, it ultimately achieves good fortune and fulfills its will without being bitten. Still, it is perilous—neither the first nor the second would willingly accept such a position.\n\nNine at the top, having completed its affairs at the end of treading, reviews its path and examines its omens, then returns to the beginning—supremely auspicious. Naturally, those like Three, unable to see, are likened to the blind; those unable to tread, to the lame. Only through blindness does one fail to act, and thus attempt to wrestle tigers bare-handed or act as a warrior before the great lord—its misfortune is assured. Though called resolute in will, what is there to commend?\n\nMaster Li the Bald said: When King Wen faced the decline of Yin, he once personally suffered its bite. How fitting that his reflections were so deeply felt and lingering! Why else would he name this hexagram *Treading on a Tiger’s Tail* with Heaven above and Marsh below? And why, in the line statements, speak of being bitten as misfortune, yet in the *Image* declare that not being bitten brings prosperity? The prosperity of not being bitten arises from the inner softness of Dui. The misfortune of being bitten stems from Six Three’s rigid will, unlike Four’s fulfilled aspiration.\n\nAlas! In such times, one could not tread plainly like the first, nor retreat like the reclusive second, nor return like the final nine. In the aftermath of pain, even King Wen must have regretted his warrior’s lament. Thus, the blind gaze and lame tread were King Wen’s affairs before his imprisonment at Youli. The anxious dread that ended in good fortune were his affairs after Youli. The return to supreme auspiciousness came only after he was enfeoffed as Lord of the West and granted the power to wage war—all King Wen’s hexagram. It directly illuminates *Brightness Obscured*.\n\nWang Benhe said: Rather than anxiously seeking to avoid being bitten, how much better to tread the Way with ease and attain steadfast auspiciousness!\n\n**Appendix**\nCheng Zhengshu said: Heaven above and marsh below—this is the proper order of above and below, the principle of things. The noble person observes the image of *Treading* to distinguish between high and low and settle the people’s will. Only when the distinction between high and low is clear can the people’s will be settled. With the people’s will settled, governance can then be discussed.\n\nIn ancient times, from dukes and ministers downward, each position matched its virtue, and one remained in it for life, fulfilling one’s proper role. If a position did not match one’s virtue, the ruler would promote one; scholars cultivated their learning, and when their learning was complete, the ruler would seek them. Farmers, artisans, merchants, and traders diligently performed their tasks with limited rewards, so all had settled aspirations.\n\nIn later ages, from common scholars to high ministers, all daily aspired to honor and glory. Farmers, artisans, merchants, and traders daily pursued wealth and extravagance. The hearts of the multitudes raced after profit, and the world was in chaos—how could it be unified? To expect it not to descend into disorder would be difficult indeed.\n\nBelow, Qian; above, Kun.\n\n**Peace (泰):**\n\"Small departs, great arrives—auspicious, smooth.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\nPeace—small departs, great arrives, auspicious, smooth—means Heaven and Earth unite, and the myriad things communicate; above and below unite, and their aspirations align. Within, yang; without, yin. Within, strength; without, compliance. Within, the noble person; without, the petty person. The noble person’s Dao grows, the petty person’s Dao wanes.\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\nHeaven and Earth unite in Peace. The ruler thereby completes the Dao of Heaven and Earth, assisting and harmonizing with their principles, to guide the people.\n\n**First Nine:**\n\"Pulling cogon grass by its roots, advancing with its kind—auspicious in advancement.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\n\"Pulling cogon grass, advancing auspiciously\"—the aspiration lies in the external.\n\n**Nine Two:**\n\"Embracing the vast, fording the river; no distant exclusion, no clique loyalty—attaining esteem in the central conduct.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\n\"Embracing the vast, attaining esteem in the central conduct\"—thereby illuminating and magnifying.\n\n**Nine Three:**\n\"Level without incline, advancing without return—steadfast in hardship, no blame. Do not worry over its sincerity; in nourishment, there is fortune.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\n\"Advancing without return\"—the boundary of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Six Four:**\n\"Fluttering, not wealthy, with its neighbors—no warning, yet sincere.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\n\"Fluttering, not wealthy\"—all lose substance. \"No warning, yet sincere\"—the heart’s desire.\n\n**Six Five:**\n\"Di Yi marries off his younger sister—blessing, supremely auspicious.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\n\"Blessing, supremely auspicious\"—acting from the center to fulfill aspirations.\n\n**Top Six:**\n\"The city wall collapses into the moat—do not mobilize troops. From the capital, decrees are issued—steadfastness brings regret.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\n\"The city wall collapses into the moat\"—its mandate is in chaos.\n\n**Earth above, Heaven below—Peace.**\nPeace: small departs, great arrives. \"Auspicious, smooth\" speaks of the way to achieve Peace. Only when small and great exchange departures and arrivals can the small be auspicious, the great smooth, and Peace enduring. Thus, the First Nine, situated at the base of the three yang lines, embodies the inception of greatness yet aspires to the external. The yin of the outer seeks to unite with the small, pulling the three yang lines forward in kind—hence the four lines flutter in mutual trust, and small and great exchange.\n\nThe three yin lines, all lacking wealth and substance, should not sincerely respond to the yang. Yet now they flutteringly advance to unite with yang—how could this involve mobilization or warning? It is the heart’s desire, unwarned yet sincere. It is not for the wealth of their neighbors but to serve between the ruler and minister of the second and fifth lines. Thus, Nine Two, with the virtue of embracing the vast, esteems the host, while Six Five, with blessing and supreme auspiciousness, marries off the younger sister—not only fulfilling aspirations but also realizing them. Is this not the way to achieve Peace: a ruler who empties himself to heed his ministers, and ministers who embrace the vast to illuminate their ruler?\n\nYet knowing the way to Peace lies in the exchange of departures and arrivals, one also knows that such exchanges cannot endure. Peace is difficult to preserve—this too must be considered. Thus, within the inner trigram at the third line and the outer trigram at the top, it is uniquely emphasized. The \"boundary of Heaven and Earth\" speaks of their juncture. The union of Heaven and Earth, once united, disperses; once joined, separates—it cannot last. For level and incline, advance and return, sincerity is evident, yet this is not something human effort can control. Yet knowing this and steadfastly enduring hardship, one may avoid the blame of great adversity, the blame of incline, the blame of advance. Why? Human determination can overcome Heaven.\n\nThus, it warns: \"Do not worry over its sincerity.\" If sincerity is thus, and one assumes Peace must advance, merely knowing this and enduring hardship to preserve it—without treating it as perpetual—can sustain Peace. Then one may not only avoid the blame of great adversity but also long enjoy the fortune of Peace. Hence: \"In nourishment, there is fortune.\" Thus, if you but endure hardship, Peace will not depart. Though there be constant patterns, what can they do to you?\n\nThe third line, at the top of the lower trigram, marks the juncture of Peace’s exchange—hence special attention is given. The top line, at the extreme of Peace, sees the city wall collapse into the moat, reverting from above to below. Do not mobilize the masses—they will not heed. Why? Above and below do not unite. From the capital, decrees are issued—its mandate is already in chaos. Though one wishes to endure hardship, it is no longer possible. Alas! Should one not be warned early?\n\n**Appendix:**\nFeng Qi said: After Qian and Kun, one first enters the human Dao, traversing six Kan trigrams, experiencing all hardships and dangers, accumulating within and treading without—only then is Peace achieved. Yet after Peace, Adversity follows, revealing how difficult it is for humanity to stand and how easily chaos arises. This is the profound intent of those who arranged the *Yi*.\n\nWang Fusi said: Cogon grass, when pulled, has roots that connect and draw together. *Ru* describes this connected appearance. The three yang lines share the same aspiration, all directed outward. The first is of its kind; when the leader rises, the kind follows. Hence: \"advancing with its kind—auspicious in advancement.\"\n\nCheng Zhengshu said: The *Xiang* cites \"embracing the vast\" to comprehensively explain the meaning of the four lines. It says that thus one can align with the virtue of the central conduct, and one’s Dao will be luminous and grand.\n\nShi Shoudao said: Beyond the second line, \"level without incline\"; beyond the fifth, \"the city wall collapses into the moat.\"\n\nYang Tingxiu said: Level and incline alternate; advance and return shift. Those in an age of Peace must not assume the times are level—danger will soon arise. They must not assume yin has departed—its return is swift. Nine Three is the extreme of yang’s flourishing. Yin will return, Peace will turn to Adversity. Should one not fear? Why? The juncture of Heaven and Earth’s exchange, the interplay of yin and yang, lies between Nine Three and Six Four.\n\nJin Rubai said: \"Attaining esteem in the center\" is like a feudal lord marrying a princess.\n\nThe virtue of Nine Two enables it to esteem the central conduct of Six Five as its lord.\n\nWang Fusi further said: Dwelling at the utmost of *Tai* (Peace), each returns to its counterpart—thus the Dao of *Tai* is about to perish. Above and below do not interact; the lowly do not ascend to serve, the exalted do not descend to bestow. Hence, \"the city wall collapses into the moat.\" \"Do not mobilize troops\"—no need for attack. \"From the city, proclamations are issued\"—this is the *Pi* (Adversity) Dao’s steadfast constraint, where commands already issued cannot be executed.\n\nMaster Po (Su Shi) explained: Taking earth from the moat to build a city, raising and fortifying it—this is not for the city’s benefit, but for the people’s. When *Kun* (Earth) is above and seeks to return below, it is like earth made into a wall longing to return to the moat. When the above loses its defense, the below schemes to usurp command. Thus it is said: \"From the city, proclamations are issued.\" A city is not where commands should originate.\n\n*Kun* below, *Qian* above—*Pi*’s \"not the proper person.\" \"Not advantageous.\" \"The great departs, the small arrives.\"\n\nThe *Xiang* (Image) says: \"*Pi*’s 'not the proper person'—not advantageous. The noble person’s steadfastness. The great departs, the small arrives\"—this means Heaven and Earth do not interact, and the myriad things are not connected. Above and below do not interact, and the realm has no guiding state. Within, yin; without, yang. Within, softness; without, hardness. Within, the petty person; without, the noble person. The petty person’s Dao grows, the noble person’s Dao wanes.\n\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Heaven and Earth do not interact—*Pi*.\" The noble person, through frugal virtue, avoids calamity; one must not seek glory through emolument.\n\n**First Six:** \"Pulling cogon grass, roots entwined—by its kind. Steadfastness brings good fortune and smoothness.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Pulling cogon grass—steadfastness brings good fortune,\" for the aspiration lies with the lord.\n\n**Six Two:** \"Enveloping and submitting—petty persons find good fortune; great persons find adversity, yet smoothness.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Great persons find adversity, yet smoothness,\" for they do not disrupt the group.\n\n**Six Three:** \"Enveloping shame.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Enveloping shame,\" for the position is not appropriate.\n\n**Nine Four:** \"Having mandate, no blame. Companions partake in blessing.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Having mandate, no blame,\" for the aspiration is fulfilled.\n\n**Nine Five:** \"Ceasing adversity—great persons find good fortune. 'It may perish! It may perish!'—as if striking the roots of the mulberry.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Great persons’ good fortune,\" for the position is correct and fitting.\n\n**Top Nine:** \"Overturning adversity—first adversity, then joy.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"When adversity ends, it overturns—how can it last long?\"\n\nHeaven and Earth in *Pi* (Adversity). Only when the small departs and the great arrives—with a single interaction—is *Tai* (Peace) achieved. Thus, when the great departs and the small arrives, the lack of interaction forms *Pi*. Therefore, the way to bring about *Pi* lies entirely in \"not the proper person.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"not the proper person\"? It is because they claim the noble person’s steadfastness, yet the great do not come, the small do not depart, and there is no interaction—hence *Pi*. Some ask: \"Steadfastness means correctness. If steadfastness itself is not advantageous, why does it say 'not advantageous for the noble person’s steadfastness'? Moreover, First Six’s 'pulling cogon grass, roots entwined' is also linked to steadfastness, good fortune, and smoothness. Yet yin’s softness, entwined in kind, is the very opposite of steadfastness—why does the sage reverse this, calling it steadfast, good, and capable of smoothing adversity?\"\n\nIt is said: This is yin departing to interact with yang, knowing only that the small should depart but entirely unaware that the noble person’s steadfastness should not depart. Thus, as this departs and that arrives, this does not see itself as petty, nor does that see itself as noble. Not seeing itself as petty is the absence of the petty person—thus the petty person’s Dao wanes. Not seeing itself as noble means both are noble—thus the noble person’s Dao grows, and growth brings *Tai*. Observing this Dao, all is small departing and great arriving—hence the way to bring about *Pi* is evident.\n\nNow, if one wishes to reverse *Pi* and achieve *Tai*, how can one still claim to possess the noble person’s steadfastness alone? Precisely because one has steadfastness, one is \"not the proper person.\" Thus it is said: \"*Pi*’s 'not the proper person'—smoothness.\" *Pi* is something to contemplate.\n\nTherefore, with First Six’s \"pulling cogon grass, roots entwined,\" its aspiration lies with the lord—thus Nine Four’s companions partake in blessing, its aspiration fulfilled, and above and below interact. Nine Four dwells at the lower position of the upper trigram, holding the incipient signs of *Tai*’s return and the mandate’s imminent restoration. Moreover, it occupies the position of a great minister, near the lord’s domain. Having fulfilled its aspiration, it naturally incurs no blame, and all kinds align with its fortune. This is not merely \"pulling cogon grass, roots entwined.\"\n\nFour is the lord of First, hence \"aspiration lies with the lord.\" Therefore, with Six Two’s way of smoothing adversity, it naturally envelops and submits, making petty persons all find good fortune—what steadfastness is there? With Nine Five’s great person’s method of ceasing adversity, the great person naturally finds good fortune—not merely making petty persons find good fortune—what adversity remains?\n\nYet having said \"ceasing adversity,\" it seems at first not to regard adversity as a concern—how could one know that within, it is truly arduous, steadfast, and unyielding, constantly saying, \"It may perish! It may perish!\"—as if striking the roots of the mulberry. How could one consider this a momentary absence of self-preservation? \"First adversity, then joy\"—its impermanence is fitting.\n\nLi Tuweng said: The way to preserve *Tai* lies above all in *Qian*. The way to smooth *Pi* lies above all in *Kun*. *Qian* is Heaven—Heaven’s origin does not cover, thus Nine Two alone, with its capacity to envelop the wild, presides over *Tai*. *Kun* is Earth—Earth’s origin does not bear, thus Six Two alone, with its way of enveloping, submitting, and compliance, smooths *Pi*. Yet though *Tai* governs the world with enveloping vastness, it truly conducts itself with arduous steadfastness—hence it is said: \"Arduous steadfastness—no blame.\" This is what is meant by King Wen, from morning till the sun passed noon, having no leisure even to eat.\n\nThough *Pi* treats others with enveloping submission, it truly rests in its ominous cessation of adversity—hence it is said: \"Its ominousness—its ominousness—ominousness without end. Where will it return?\" This is what is meant by Goujian tasting gall and sleeping on brushwood. Nevertheless, when *Tai* prevails, all believe it to be *Tai*, yet I alone regard it as *Pi*—thus I am not swayed by *Tai* and can make *Tai* enduringly *Tai*.\n\nWhen *Pi* prevails, all believe it to be *Pi*, yet I alone regard it as *Tai*—thus I am not disturbed by *Pi* and can ensure *Pi* does not remain *Pi* to the end.\n\nThis inverted conduct, this counterflow, keeps the hilt of *Tai’e* ever in my grasp—truly the great one who brings *Pi* to rest. Yet the noble person does not undertake this—why? Because the noble person possesses steadfastness. With steadfastness, seeing others as unsteadfast, one will not go forth—how then can one avoid *Pi*? Only by \"plucking the creeping grass, its kind all drawn together,\" when yin softness unites in mutual connection, does steadfastness arise. Only by enveloping submission, enduring shame, and ensuring that what goes forth does not return, does steadfastness arise. With steadfastness comes smoothness, rest, and good fortune—thus it becomes *Tai*.\n\nHence it is said: \"Enveloping and submitting to the petty person—good fortune.\" Merely by enveloping and submitting to make the petty person prosper, one embodies the great one’s way of smoothing *Pi*—no need to wait for another day to achieve smoothness.\n\nSome ask: The second nine envelops the vast, attains eminence through the center, and in action becomes the way of *Tai*—this is entirely enveloping the vast. Why then does the line also speak of \"crossing the river\" and \"cliques bringing misfortune\"? Beyond enveloping the vast, must one also employ the courage of \"crossing the river\"? Beyond not neglecting the distant, must one also sever cliquish partiality? Not so. One who truly envelops the vast without neglecting the distant naturally severs cliquish partiality and bravely \"crosses the river.\" Otherwise, one is merely a vacillating, indecisive man.\n\nAs when Emperor Yuan of Western Han hoped for Xiang’s execution yet did not know how to restrain Dou Xian of Eastern Han, who seized the sovereign’s fields and gardens—what did he gain by \"enveloping the vast\"? Thus, though strong, one must weaken; though orderly, one must fall into chaos—how can there be any glory or attainment of the central path? The line encompasses this meaning, hence its detailed exposition.\n\n**Appendix**\nLǚ Bogong said: *Pi* is the disunion of above and below, possessing the form of Heaven and Earth but lacking their efficacy.\n\nDèng Bogao said: The second, centered and correct, assists the great lord in bringing *Pi* to rest—hence the method of enveloping and submitting to the petty person.\n\nThe third, yin-soft in *Pi*, at times endures shame to heed the petty person’s clamor, or endures shame to join the petty person’s faction.\n\nLi Sheng said: This is precisely the method of dwelling in *Pi*—what is called \"spitting on one’s face and letting it dry,\" or \"stripping off one’s robe and gambling freely.\" As for Li Gu’s execution, what did it profit the Han but to fan the flames of Liang Ji’s tyranny? Not only was it of no benefit, but it greatly harmed the state. Thus, the line does not attach good fortune, misfortune, regret, or remorse to enduring shame, and the *Xiang* merely notes its improper position. For it is neither the position of the great lord at nine-five nor that of the great minister at nine-four—what can it do but watch for opportunity?\n\nThe compliance of Chen Ping and others, who flattered and followed the will of the king and the Lü clan, serves as an example. What is called \"the great one smoothing *Pi* without confusion\" is truly so. Hence it is said: \"To rebuke at court today, a remonstrating minister is not as effective as a decisive sovereign; to secure the altars of state and the Liu succession, a later lord is not as effective as a minister.\" Alas, who would say enduring shame is truly inappropriate? Reading this, one can only weep. Such words are truly difficult to speak to others. Only those with a true heart, unbetraying of person, family, or state, will silently understand.\n\nXióng Guo said: *Xiū* (rest) means people resting in the shade of trees; *bāo sāng* (bundled mulberry) refers to the budding of tender mulberry shoots, as in the *Odes*’ \"mutual bundling of the boxthorn.\"\n\nDèng Bogao further said: *Bāo sāng* is not a metaphor for solid bonds but resembles the ancients’ \"rotting rope driving six horses\" or \"treading on a tiger’s tail and spring ice.\" In Lu Xuangong’s *Memorial Requesting the Cessation of Troops After the Recovery of Hebei*, he wrote: \"The state’s pillars, darkly and continuously linked, are like bundled mulberry, gracefully entwined—fortunate not to snap, though threadlike.\" Thus, *bāo* means clustered growth. Clustered mulberry, thin and weak—how can it bear heavy ties?\n\nShào Guoxián said: *Pi* and *Tai* are matters of timing. Timing is what the ruler and the noble person bring about. Thus, the *Xiang* of *Tai* says \"the way of the ruler is above,\" while the *Xiang* of *Pi* says \"the way of the noble person is below.\" In the time of *Tai*, wealth and assistance are complete, and the noble person joins in—what strength is needed? Now it is otherwise—this is called \"frugal virtue.\"\n\n**Li** (Fire below Heaven): *Tóngrén* (Fellowship) in the wild—smooth. Favorable to ford the great river; favorable for the noble person’s steadfastness.\n\nThe *Tuan* says: *Tóngrén*—the soft attains position and the center, responding to *qián*, hence \"fellowship.\" \"Fellowship in the wild—smooth; favorable to ford the great river\"—*qián* is in motion. Illuminating and strong, centered and correct, responding—this is the noble person’s steadfastness. Only the noble person can unite the world’s aspirations.\n\nThe *Xiang* says: Heaven and fire—*tóngrén*. The noble person thereby classifies clans and distinguishes things.\n\n**First Nine**: Fellowship at the gate—no blame.\nThe *Xiang* says: Going forth to fellowship—who would blame this?\n\n**Six Two**: Fellowship within the clan—regret.\nThe *Xiang* says: Fellowship within the clan—this is the way of regret.\n\n**Nine Three**: Hiding troops in the thicket, ascending the high mound—three years without rising.\nThe *Xiang* says: Hiding troops in the thicket—opposing the firm. Three years without rising—how can one act?\n\n**Nine Four**: Mounting the ramparts, not attacking—good fortune.\nThe *Xiang* says: Mounting the ramparts—righteousness does not permit attack. Its good fortune lies in being constrained and returning to principle.\n\n**Nine Five**: Fellowship—first wailing and weeping, then laughing. The great armies meet.\nThe *Xiang* says: The beginning of fellowship—centered and upright. The great armies meet—this speaks of mutual overcoming.\n\n**Top Nine**: Fellowship in the outskirts—no regret.\nThe *Xiang* says: [Text incomplete in original]\n\nThe *Xiang* says: Fellowship in the outskirts—its aspiration is not yet achieved.\n\n**Heaven-Fire Fellowship (Tongren)**\nA single yin resides above the second line, while the five yang below all desire fellowship—thus it is called \"fellowship in the wilds.\" By occupying the center and attaining its proper position, it naturally becomes the clan’s ancestral standard. A single yin resides above the fifth line, while the five yang below all belong to it—thus it is called \"Great Possession,\" fundamentally prosperous. By dwelling in softness yet occupying the honored position, its power naturally enables greatness. Yet the fifth line finds it easy to possess greatness, while the second struggles to serve as the clan’s standard—this is the distinction between above and below, the difference in the power of honor and humility.\n\nThus, in *Great Possession*, the sixth five alone achieves supreme fortune in greatness, while in *Fellowship*, the six two cannot avoid the regret of being bound to the clan. Yet though the six two may see itself as burdened by the clan’s regret, the five yang regard it as truly in fellowship with the wilds. Therefore, the *Tuan* commentary settles on the four characters \"fellowship in the wilds\" to name the hexagram.\n\nFrom a present perspective: the first line emerges from the gate in search of fellowship. The third conceals troops in the thicket in search of fellowship. The fourth mounts the ramparts in search of fellowship. The fifth alone wails and weeps, raising great armies to seek fellowship. And the top line ventures to the outskirts, gazing afar, hoping for even a single moment of fellowship. Thus, the five yang above and below all take the second as their standard, desiring to join in fellowship—this is evident. What they all share is the fellowship of the entire hexagram; if not the fellowship of the wilds, then what?\n\nThe four-character hexagram name appears only here and in \"Adversity’s\" \"not of the people.\" As for \"Treading the tiger’s tail\" or \"Stilling one’s back,\" these three-character hexagram names follow another pattern. Yet this hexagram is truly named *Fellowship* because the second and fifth share a single heart. Thus, the *Tuan* commentary first speaks of fellowship, saying: \"The soft attains its position, attains the center, and responds to Qian—this is fellowship.\" \"Responds to Qian\" refers specifically to the fifth line.\n\nIf this is so, then why does the hexagram *Fellowship* say: \"Fellowship in the wilds, prosperity, beneficial to ford the great river\"? It means not only that the fifth responds to the second, desiring fellowship with it, but that all of Qian’s movements seek to respond to the second, to join in fellowship with it. Thus, it says \"Qian moves\"—this is clear. The reason lies in the six two’s civil brilliance and strength, its centered correctness and responsiveness, possessing the rectitude of the noble person. Rectitude unites the aspirations of all under heaven—how could this apply only to the fifth?\n\nThus, the fellowship of the wilds, the benefit of fording the river, the prosperity of fellowship—what doubt remains? Yet there are inevitably disputes from the third and fourth lines, and the overcoming of the nine five. Its nearness may seem regrettable, leading to the regret attributed to the second line. But if the six two truly possesses the steadfastness of the noble person—centered, correct, and responsive—then nothing can harm its fellowship in the wilds. If it truly has the power to sever metal like shared words, the fragrance of orchids, then the mutual trust between the second and fifth—how could the third and fourth contend against it? Though I may be seen as regrettable, I will not be concerned.\n\nThis is why the Master, in the *Wenyan*, concludes with the words of two people in fellowship: \"like the severing of metal, the shared heart’s words, the fragrance of orchids.\" Alas! The transmission between Yao and Shun, between Confucius and Yan—flowing to the damp, following the clouds with the wind, responding to sound and seeking qi—how could there be any regret? Thus, King Wen was moved by the nine five, and the Master by the six two.\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Shi’s explanation: \"Beneficial to ford the great river—this is Qian’s movement. If one does not achieve sincere fellowship, one may unite in times of peace but dissolve when fording the river.\"\n\nTu Xi says: \"The six two does not merely respond to the nine five’s Qian; all those with whom it fellowships are Qian. To move with Qian—what is fording a river to this? A single Qian is already unbearable; how much more five Qian? The noble person may rejoice in this without ceasing.\"\n\nSu Shi’s interpretation of \"sincere fellowship\" to explain \"Qian’s movement\" seems unclear. \"Sincere fellowship\" refers to the second and fifth lines. \"Qian’s movement\" refers to the five yang’s movement, the fellowship of the wilds.\n\nSu Shi also says: \"The first nine emerges from within to fellowship with others; the top nine enters from without to fellowship with those below. Emerging from within is called the gate; entering from without is called the outskirts.\"\n\nTu Weng says: \"Emerging from the gate—this is fellowship. Emerging from the gate is immediately in fellowship with the second, with no separation. Thus it says: 'Who would blame this?'—meaning, who would cause them not to achieve fellowship? This is the fortunate phrase of the first line. The fifth is different: 'In the heart, they are in fellowship—how could I forget it?' This refers to the second and fifth. There is no room for not being in fellowship—how could there be regret? If there were regret, the nine five would certainly not raise great armies to brave the multitude and seek encounter.\"\n\nThus, Su Shi says: \"The Way of the noble person may involve going forth or staying, silence or speech. When two hearts are as one, their power can sever metal. The words of shared hearts have the fragrance of orchids.\" From this, how could one slight the nine five for using armies? Though the third and fourth are strong and cannot seize it, beginning with wailing and weeping and ending in laughter, even to the point of armies overcoming one another—they cannot break their fellowship. This reveals the sincerity of the second and fifth’s fellowship.\n\nThe second is yin; the fifth is yang. Yin and yang differ yet become *Fellowship*—thus we know their fellowship is certain. The noble person may differ in going forth, staying, speaking, or silence, yet become *Fellowship*—thus we know their fellowship is certain. If it is certain, then even the hardest and strongest things cannot intervene. Thus it says: \"Their power can sever metal.\"\n\nTu Weng says: \"Li Bai followed Prince Yong of Lin and was sentenced to death. Guo Ziyi offered his rank and titles to ransom him. Later, Bai was again imprisoned in Xunyang.\"\n\nSong Ruosi deployed three thousand troops to repel and reclaim him. Alas! In an age devoid of like-minded companions, where may the great worthies and noble persons entrust their lives? This is why, in the *Fellowship* of the wilds, the sage does not take it as the model.\n\nXiong Guo says: *Fellowship* and *Great Possession* are both hexagrams of five yang lines with one yin. In *Great Possession*, the ruling yin resides in the fifth line, hence it is said to be \"supremely prosperous.\" In *Fellowship*, the yin resides in the second line, yet the yang lines honor it as their ancestor—thus it is called \"prosperous\" and \"the steadfastness of the noble person.\" *Ancestor* means \"honored.\" As the *Book of Songs* says: \"The noble person honors it; though their aspirations are not yet fulfilled, they unite the aspirations of all under Heaven.\" This is the reversal and rectification.\n\nJiang Tingshan says: \"Lying in ambush in the thickets, awaiting the fifth line’s vulnerability, ascending the high mound to observe the second line’s movements—yet after three years, they do not rise, for the fifth line ultimately cannot be disrespected.\"\n\n---\n**Qian below, Li above**\n**Great Possession: Supreme prosperity.**\n\n*The Judgment* says: *Great Possession*—the yielding attains the honored position, great and central, with all below responding to it, hence \"Great Possession.\" Its virtue is firm and strong, radiant and bright, responding to Heaven and acting in accord with the seasons—thus it is \"supremely prosperous.\"\n\n*The Image* says: Fire above Heaven is *Great Possession*. The noble person thereby suppresses evil and extols good, following Heaven’s gracious mandate.\n\n**First Nine:** At the outset, exchanges bring harm, yet no blame. In hardship, there is no blame.\n*The Image* says: In *Great Possession’s* first nine, exchanges at the outset bring harm.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** With a great wagon for bearing, there is somewhere to go—no blame.\n*The Image* says: With a great wagon for bearing, the accumulation within does not fail.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** The duke offers sacrifice to the Son of Heaven; the petty man cannot.\n*The Image* says: The duke offers sacrifice to the Son of Heaven—this is harmful for the petty man.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Not in its fullness—no blame.\n*The Image* says: Not in its fullness—no blame, for it is bright, discerning, and wise.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Its sincerity is interwoven, its majesty is manifest—good fortune.\n*The Image* says: Its sincerity is interwoven, for trust gives rise to aspiration. The good fortune of manifest majesty lies in ease without excess.\n\n**Top Nine:** From Heaven comes aid—good fortune, nothing not beneficial.\n*The Image* says: The good fortune of *Great Possession’s* top line comes from Heaven’s aid.\n\n---\n**Fire over Heaven: Great Possession**\n\nFang Shihua says: Su Shi observed that all great things are seen as possessed by the fifth line, hence \"Great Possession.\" In the age of *Great Possession*, all below respond to the fifth, serving with interwoven sincerity and manifest majesty. The fifth lord, in turn, responds to Heaven and acts in accord with the seasons to enjoy *Great Possession*, receiving Heaven’s aid—good fortune, nothing not beneficial. For one born into such times, navigating the world is already fraught, and the web of connections ever widens—truly, it is arduous. One must not hastily assume it is easy.\n\nThe first nine, at the lowest position, is still in the initial stage of exchange. Yet exchange begins here. Initial exchange thus brings initial harm—one knows that exchange inevitably entails harm. Therefore, it is taught the way to avoid blame: avoiding blame lies solely in overcoming hardship. If one can overcome hardship, then even daily engagement with the world—what harm could there be? Thus, the second nine, with a great wagon, does not fail. Not failing is to avoid harm.\n\nThe third nine, offering sacrifice to the Son of Heaven, may be a duke. As a duke offering sacrifice, there is no harm. The fourth nine, not in its fullness, dwells in abundance yet knows fear; knowing fear, there is again no harm. Thus, harm lies in the person. Only when one indulges in *Great Possession* without knowing hardship to govern it does one gradually fall into harm—what has this to do with exchange?\n\nNow observe the third nine: occupying the top of the lower trigram, it is the duke’s position. With firmness in the correct place, it is fit to share the Son of Heaven’s great fortune in *Great Possession*. For it deeply knows hardship and can be cautious from the outset—like the Grand Duke of Qi. But the likes of Han Xin and Peng Yue brought harm upon themselves and could not endure, for they knew not hardship.\n\nThe fourth nine is perilously close to the fifth six, at the height of abundance. Yet as yang dwelling in yin, it alone can exhaust all it possesses, making it the lord’s possession while daring not claim the slightest for itself—hence \"not in its fullness,\" for it is bright, discerning, and wise. Only with true wisdom surpassing others can one deeply know hardship and be so cautious to the end—like Tao Zhugong and Zhang Zifang.\n\nFrom this, I observe: in the age of *Great Possession*, the lord is yielding and central, the minister overcomes hardship; the lord has interwoven sincerity, the minister’s initial exchanges bring no harm—only then can they together enjoy the fortune of *Great Possession*. Otherwise, misfortune and blame will come. Thus, the lord’s increasing yielding and the minister’s increasing hardship are the sage’s subtle intent.\n\nWang Benhe says: The top nine, \"from Heaven comes aid,\" is because the fifth six responds to Heaven and acts in accord with the seasons to attain supreme prosperity.\n\n---\n**Appendix**\nCheng Zhengshu says: \"The duke offers sacrifice to the Son of Heaven\"—if a petty man occupies this position, it becomes harmful. Since ancient times, feudal lords who could loyally and obediently serve their superiors nurtured their people as shields and bulwarks for the king, enriching their resources to await the ruler’s levies. If a petty man occupies this position, with a numerous people and abundant wealth, they will instead arrogate their prosperity and strength, becoming ever more disobedient—thus, *Great Possession* becomes harmful for the petty man. Moreover, *Great Possession* is the petty man’s harm.\n\nZhang Youyu says: The *Book of Songs* says: \"The messengers are vigorous, the chariots are vigorous, the teams of four are vigorous, the four steeds are vigorous\"—all conveying the sense of flourishing strength.\n\nYang Tingshu says: The fifth six is the lord of *Great Possession*.\n\nWith clarity yet veiling it, holding it with the emptiness of yin at the center, and entrusting it solely to softness and sincerity—thus can one stir the aspirations of those below. The spirits submit to the hearts of those below; when those below are stirred, the sincerity between ruler and minister becomes firm without need for covenant. When the spirits of those below submit, the majesty of the Dao and virtue harmonizes without need for severity.\n\nSincerity stirs aspiration: with my own sincerity, I stir their sincerity. Gentleness without excess: with my own harmony and ease, I penetrate their defenses. Wang Fusi says: Dwelling in honor with softness, abiding in greatness with centeredness, without selfishness toward things—above and below respond to this. Sincerity stirs aspiration, thus their sincerity intermingles like flowing water. Without selfishness toward things, things too become impartial; without doubt toward things, things too become sincere. Being both impartial and sincere, what difficulty or defense remains? Teaching spreads without words, and majesty arises without effort. If one were to be the lord of *Great Possession* yet not attain good fortune through this Dao, how could it be possible?\n\nSu Shi’s explanation says: The fifth six dwells amid the abundance of firmness yet alone employs softness—this is the utmost lack of defense. Precisely because of this lack of defense, things trust it, and thus those who return to it intermingle like flowing water. How can this softness yet possess majesty? Because it lacks excess, knowing it has abundance. Defense arises from insufficiency; when the form of insufficiency appears outwardly, majesty wanes. It is also said: What Heaven assists is compliance; what people assist is trust. Treading trust and contemplating compliance, and moreover esteeming worthiness—thus is one aided by Heaven, and good fortune, with nothing not beneficial. Trust, compliance, and esteeming worthiness—these are the virtues of the fifth six. Gentleness without excess—this is the compliance of the fifth six. Its sincerity intermingling like flowing water—this is the trust of the fifth six. The masses return to it—this is the esteeming of worthiness of the fifth six. The top nine uniquely treads this: what you tread is both compliant and trustworthy, and moreover esteems worthiness—then to whom will the aid of Heaven and humanity turn? Thus it is said: The sage has no merit, the spirit has no name—and the top nine of *Great Possession* does not reveal the source of its blessings.\n\nLiu Yongxiang says: The fifth six alone fully expounds the virtue by which the fifth six attains *Great Possession*. The top nine alone fully expounds the good fortune by which the fifth six attains *Great Possession*. With both fortune and virtue complete, this is *Great Possession*. The fifth six and the top nine unite as one. Thus, the top nine—it is Heaven.\n\n**Below and Earth above: Humility.** *Humility*: Flourishing. The noble person brings things to completion.\n\n*The Judgment* says: *Humility*—flourishing. The Dao of Heaven descends and brings illumination; the Dao of Earth is lowly yet ascends. The Dao of Heaven diminishes the full and augments the humble; the Dao of Earth alters the full and flows to the humble. Ghosts and spirits harm the full and bless the humble; the Dao of humanity detests the full and loves the humble. Humility is honored and radiant, lowly yet unblemished—this is the noble person’s completion.\n\n*The Image* says: Within Earth there is a mountain—*Humility*. The noble person reduces the many to benefit the few, weighing things to bestow evenly.\n\n**First six:** The humbly humble noble person—crossing the great river brings good fortune.\n*The Image* says: The humbly humble noble person—using lowliness to cultivate the self.\n\n**Second six:** Resonant humility—constancy brings good fortune.\n*The Image* says: Resonant humility—constancy brings good fortune, for the center is attained.\n\n**Third nine:** The toiling and humble noble person—bringing things to completion brings good fortune.\n*The Image* says: The toiling and humble noble person—all the people submit.\n\n**Fourth six:** Without excess, vigorously practicing humility.\n*The Image* says: Without excess, vigorously practicing humility—this is not transgressing the norm.\n\n**Fifth six:** Not wealthy, yet with one’s neighbors—beneficial to employ in punitive expeditions, without excess.\n*The Image* says: Beneficial to employ in punitive expeditions—punishing the disobedient.\n\n**Top six:** Resonant humility—beneficial to employ in military campaigns, punishing city-states.\n*The Image* says: Resonant humility—the aspiration is not yet attained. It is permissible to employ in military campaigns, punishing city-states.\n\n**Earth above Mountain: Humility.** *Humility*—flourishing. The noble person brings things to completion.\n\nIt has already spoken of flourishing—why then speak of the noble person’s completion? Completion contrasts with beginning. That *humility* must flourish is beyond doubt; *The Judgment* has already expounded this in detail. Yet generally, for the noble person who is modest and yielding, there may be times at the beginning when flourishing is not assured, but in the end, flourishing is beyond doubt. The sage fears that seeing the lack of flourishing at the beginning, one might become uneasy with humility, and thus emphasizes completion.\n\nKing Wen’s humility, surpassing even that of Taibo and King Wen—when Taibo thrice yielded the world to Jili, cutting his hair, tattooing his body, and fleeing to the barbarians of Jing, this was distress without flourishing, reaching the limits of what human sentiment could endure. Yet in the end, he gloriously possessed the state of Wu—this was Taibo’s noble completion. King Wen, yielding two-thirds of the world to Shang, could also be called diminishing the self to give to others, like King Tai’s affair with the Di. What flourishing was there? Yet in the end, he established the eight-hundred-year Zhou—this was King Wen’s noble completion. Thus the Master judged these two sages as possessing the highest virtue. This hexagram further clarifies that *humility* must flourish, and the intent is evident.\n\nThus it is said: If you do not boast, none in the world will contend with you in ability. If you do not vaunt, none in the world will contend with you in merit. Was it only after the four hundred years of the Xia that Yu’s humility, truly without contenders in merit and ability, became apparent? Kongzi and Yan Hui, humbly humble and untried, yet in the end became the teachers of the world for ten thousand generations—this is the greatest and most manifest of the noble person’s completion.\n\nThe hexagram speaks of *humility* flourishing and again speaks of completion—how profound! The hexagram speaks of the noble person’s completion, yet the line alone speaks of the noble person’s completion bringing good fortune—how could there be no intent? For the third nine is the lord of the hexagram—the toiling and humble one.\n\nThe rest merely echo humility or respond in humility. Alas! To toil without boasting, to achieve merit without claiming virtue—this is the utmost of generosity. One whose virtue is profound casts a deep radiance; the giver will surely reap its recompense. That the noble person’s completion brings good fortune—why should there be any doubt regarding the third nine? **Appendix:**\n\nXiong Guo says: The lower position is called \"humble-humble.\"\nFang Shihua says: Lowliness is not humility; it is through lowliness that humility is revealed. Hence it is said: \"Use lowliness to cultivate the self.\" The character *mu* (牧, \"to cultivate\") in *Shuowen* is composed of *zhi* (支), which is interchangeable with *pu* (扑, \"to strike\"), and *niu* (牛, \"ox\"), meaning \"one who tends oxen.\" The ox is a massive creature, symbolizing human strength and yang; when it is tamed and submissive, there is the Way of cultivation. Su Shi explains: When the male crows, the female responds, so the *Yi* uses the interplay of yin and yang to convey the resonance of humility. The essence of humility lies in the third line. *Gen*’s control rests in the third, and the third humbly places *Gen* below *Kun*—its humility is extreme, hence it is called \"toiling humility.\" The second six is its neighbor, the upper six its mate, so both harmonize with it and echo humility. Moreover, the second six, being yin and positioned in the center of the inner trigram, is thus called \"steadfast and auspicious.\" *Wu* (呜, \"to echo\") describes their harmony; *zhen* (贞, \"steadfast\") in the third shows that this arises from nature, not compulsion.\n\nJiao Ruohou says: *Dao* (捣, \"to pound\") means to break apart. It is composed of *shou* (手, \"hand\") and *gao* (高, \"high\") as phonetic, and is interchangeable with *hui* (麾, \"to wave\"). In the *Book of Songs*, it appears as \"waving with the arm,\" and in the *Book of Documents* as \"holding a white banner to wave\"—it is also written as *dao*. Yang Jian says: Six yin lines, four yin lines, the body of *Kun* being yin, and not centered—this presents the image of excessive humility. Thus the sage teaches to \"pound away\" this humility, yet fearing doubt, adds \"nothing is not advantageous\" to *pounding humility*. It says: \"If it does not transgress principle,\" meaning that even when pounding away humility, it does not reach the point of transgression.\n\nCheng Zhengshu says: To subdue through civil virtue—this is what humility and compliance cannot achieve. If civil virtue cannot subdue, yet one does not employ might and martial power, how can the world be governed? Here humility has gone too far. The Bald Elder says: *Kun*’s excess in humility may stem from fear of harm or disadvantage. Now, with *Kun*’s compliant hexagram and the fourth six’s line, yielding and compliance reach their utmost. Upholding this compliance, not daring to transgress principle—though it brings no disadvantage—if one adds humility, is this not too excessive? Excess invites contempt; this is not humility. Thus the upper three lines all instruct to \"pound away\" humility, making use of punitive expeditions. In sum, it is not about waging war over a neighbor’s wealth; if there are those who refuse to submit, how can one not strike? This is like Tang’s campaign against Ge. The upper six reaches the extreme of humility and compliance. If it still echoes in harmony, does the third nine’s humility not become excessive? Even within one’s own domain, can one truly have one’s way? This is like the Duke of Zhou’s eastern campaign. Thus do I recognize the sage’s skill in discoursing on humility. The inner three lines emphasize restraint, so their virtue is displayed; the outer three lines emphasize compliance, so their excess is guarded against. The sage’s way of gathering the abundant to supplement the deficient is like this.\n\nWang Ji says: Concealing the high within the low—this is the image of humility. The noble person takes from the surplus to benefit the deficient, so that the worthy and unworthy are equalized. By lowering one’s position before others, the noble and base are equalized. None of humility’s six lines are inauspicious. Humility means inner restraint and outer compliance. If one lacks inner restraint but maintains outer compliance, this becomes feigned reverence and affected dignity—something the noble person does not value.\n\n**Hexagram 16: Yu (豫, \"Delight\")**\n*Below Kun (坤, \"The Receptive\"), above Zhen (震, \"The Arousing\")*\n**Yu:** Favorable for establishing lords and deploying armies.\n\n**The Judgment:**\n*Yu*: The firm finds resonance, and its will is carried out. Compliant yet active—this is *Yu*. *Yu* is compliant yet active, so heaven and earth follow its pattern—how could it not be favorable for establishing lords and deploying armies? Heaven and earth move in compliance, so the sun and moon do not err, and the four seasons do not falter. The sage moves in compliance, so punishments are clear and the people submit. The timeliness of *Yu*—how great it is!\n\n**The Image:**\nThunder emerges from the earth, arousing—this is *Yu*. The former kings, in accordance with this, composed music to exalt virtue, offering it reverently to the Supreme Emperor and pairing it with ancestral spirits.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Six:** Echoing delight—misfortune.\n**The Image:** The initial six’s echoing delight—its will is exhausted, hence misfortune.\n\n**Six in the Second:** Firm as stone, not a full day—steadfast and auspicious.\n**The Image:** \"Not a full day, steadfast and auspicious\"—this is due to central correctness.\n\n**Six in the Third:** Sighing in delight—regret. Delay brings regret.\n**The Image:** \"Sighing in delight brings regret\"—its position is not appropriate.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Deriving delight—great attainment. Do not doubt. Friends gather like hairpins.\n**The Image:** \"Deriving delight, great attainment\"—its will is greatly fulfilled.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Steadfast in illness—constantly on the verge of death.\n**The Image:** The fifth six’s steadfast illness—it rides the firm. \"Constantly on the verge of death\"—its center has not yet perished.\n\n**Upper Six:** Dark delight—if it reaches completion, there will be change; no blame.\n**The Image:** \"Dark delight in the upper position\"—how can this last long?\n\n**Hexagram 16: Thunder over Earth (Yu)**\nFang Shihua says: Of *Yu*’s six lines, except for the fourth nine, which delights in the world and attains great success, the rest all err through delight. Only the second six, centered and correct, guards itself and refuses to follow others. Though it partakes in delight, it is \"not a full day\"—this is the nature of its steadfast integrity. Is there anything inauspicious here? The *Great Commentary*’s discussion of \"knowing the incipient\" precisely warns of *Yu*’s inevitable misfortune. Only the second six’s firm-as-stone resolve can foresee the incipient and thus avoid being submerged in delight. The third line’s position is inappropriate, the opposite of the second, so in its delight with the fourth, it looks up and desires to go. Having regretted its delay and hesitation in not going, it then regrets going—its fear is of the second six, its envy of the fourth nine. This is what is meant by \"emerging to see splendor and magnificence, unable to suppress the conflict in one’s breast.\"\n\nAlas! How few in the world possess the unyielding resolve of stone? Without such steadfast firmness as stone, one cannot consort with the nine in the fourth place—this much is clear from the *Yu* of *Great Possession*. For the nine in the fourth place is precisely that which is \"firm in response yet its will enacted,\" moving in accord and thus the very source of the hexagram’s *Yu*. Both *Yu* and *Return* encounter five yin lines, hence both take the image of companions. Xiong Guo said: \"Great Possession\" means one yang gains five yin. \"Companions gathered like hairpins\" means five yin unite with one yang. The six in the fifth place, yin and soft yet not upright, moreover rides atop the firmness of the nine in the fourth—it knows only ease and delight as joy, unaware that power has shifted downward and authority has entirely departed. Is this not the true and incurable malady of rulers, like the Later Lord of Liu? Death—it has long since come. That it has not yet perished is merely because the name and title barely remain, and the center has not yet turned inauspicious—yet this is no better than death. \"Center\" refers to the central position. But how many ministers like the Loyal Martial Marquis are there? Without the Loyal Martial Marquis arising from *Yu*, those who ride firmness ride the firmness of Wang Mang, ride the firmness of Sima Yi and his like—can they long avoid death? As for the six in the top place, it is submerged in *Yu* and never alters its course—why? *Yu* has already taken form and cannot be changed. If what has formed could still be altered, what blame would there be? But to change early and only then alter what has already formed—this is too late. For one should alter early, hence it is said: \"Submerged in *Yu* above—how can this last long?\" Tu Fang said: The *Tuan* statement and *Tuan* commentary of *Yu* extol the utmost beauty of attaining *Yu*, yet the six lines of *Yu* and their *Xiang* commentaries all speak of the calamities of indulging in *Yu*. Does this mean *Yu* can be attained but not enjoyed? Not so. The ruin of states and the downfall of families, ceaseless in their succession, all stem from *Yu*. Thus, if not submerged in *Yu*, one dies by *Yu*. Alas, *Yu*—to sigh in *Yu* until one’s will is exhausted is already inauspicious. Without the six in the second place’s unyielding resolve, \"not a full day,\" how could one preserve *Yu* to the end? This is precisely what it means to enjoy *Yu*—it is also the movement of compliance, the very source of attaining *Yu*. Is there any other way? Now, instead of reflecting on the source of attaining *Yu*, one merely enjoys the blessings of ease and delight—no wonder one is utterly lost in *Yu* and fortune turns to misfortune.\n\nLet us set aside these strange cases for now. Today’s scholars, clinging to the sage’s words that \"joy lies within,\" claim to know joy and forget sorrow, indulging their desires and wills, seeking only utmost pleasure. Is this truly the joy of the sage? How does this differ from sighing in *Yu* and ultimately perishing by *Yu*? The joy of the sage never departs from ardent effort. To speak of joy apart from ardent effort is to know nothing of joy. The sage’s forgetting of sorrow originates from the same place as forgetting hunger—if one is unwilling to forget hunger yet seeks only to forget sorrow, how can one not fail to forget both? Unaware of food, unaware of sorrow, unaware of old age, only lifelong ardent effort is known as joy—thus, one’s view of the world’s ease and delight is truly \"not a full day.\" Therefore, those who study the Dao must be unyielding as stone—not only in *Yu*. This is called the divine insight of \"knowing the incipient,\" the Way that penetrates above and below.\n\n**Appendix**\nQiu Xingke said: *Tun* has *Zhen* below and *Kun* above, hence it speaks of establishing lords but not of deploying armies. *Modesty* has *Kun* below and *Zhen* above, hence it speaks of deploying armies but not of establishing lords. *Yu* combines *Zhen* and *Kun* to form its body, hence it speaks of both. Su Zizhan said: The source of *Yu* lies in the fourth line, and the first harmonizes with it, hence it is called \"sighing.\" To rely on others for joy, trusting in one’s match for delight—loyalty is far indeed. Those who depend on others’ joy rejoice when others rejoice and grieve when others grieve, their will bound to dependence. When what they depend on is exhausted, they cannot but meet misfortune. Wang Ji said: Thunder rouses within the earth—this is the image of *Yu*, where the myriad things flourish and stretch. Of old, the former kings, following the harmony of heaven and earth, spread the qi of the eight winds, composed music to harmonize, and thereby aligned with the spirits and the people. From the heart it arose, through sound it moved, through posture it harmonized, through pitch it regulated, through tone it followed, and through instruments it was embodied. Thus, music is the flower of virtue, and composing music is to honor virtue. Hence, when music is complete, virtue is exalted. It is offered in the suburban and ancestral temples, sacrifices are made to heaven on the Circular Mound with the ancestor as counterpart—this is revering the revered. Sacrifices are made to the Thearch in the Bright Hall with the father as counterpart—this is honoring the honored. The Supreme Thearch is feasted, ancestors arrive, the myriad things are nurtured, and the world attains great harmony.\n\n**Hexagram 17: Following**\n*Following*: Supreme prosperity, beneficial to be upright, no blame.\n**Tuan**: *Following*: The firm comes and does not yield to the soft, moves and delights—this is *Following*. Supreme prosperity, uprightness without blame, and the world follows the times. The meaning of \"following the times\" is great indeed!\n**Xiang**: Thunder within the marsh—*Following*. The noble person, in response to dusk, enters to rest.\n**First Nine**: Office changes—uprightness is auspicious. Going out to associate brings success.\n**Xiang**: \"Office changes\"—following the upright is auspicious. \"Going out to associate brings success\"—nothing is lost.\n**Six in the Second**: Binding to the young one, losing the great man.\n**Xiang**: \"Binding to the young one\"—not both can be held.\n**Six in the Third**: Binding to the great man, losing the young one. In *Following*, seeking brings gain—beneficial to dwell in uprightness.\n**Xiang**: \"Binding to the great man\"—the will abandons the lower.\n**Nine in the Fourth**: In *Following*, there is capture—uprightness is inauspicious. Sincerity on the path, with clarity—what blame is there?\n**Xiang**: \"In *Following*, there is capture\"—its meaning is inauspicious. \"Sincerity on the path\"—clarity brings success.\n**Nine in the Fifth**: Sincerity in excellence—auspicious.\n\n**Xiang**: \"Sincerity in excellence—auspicious,\" for the position is upright and central.\n\n**Six at the Top**: Binding and restraining them, then further securing them. The king offers sacrifice on the Western Mountain.\n**Xiang**: \"Binding and restraining them\"—the top is exhausted.\n\n**Lake Thunder Following (Sui)**\nWith firm yang descending to dwell beneath two yin, it is firm coming down to the yielding. When firm descends to the yielding, how could the yielding not follow? Following is upright; not following is not upright. Who would not wish to follow uprightness? Moreover, the hexagram has *Zhen* (Thunder) moving and *Dui* (Lake) joyful—thus, movement with joy. Joy is following; lack of joy is not following. Is there a fixed way to follow? Can one be forced to follow? Hence it is said: \"The meaning of following the times is great indeed!\" Without a fixed time, there is no fixed following.\n\nHere, the *First Nine* takes the single yang as the master of *Zhen* (Thunder), serving as the officer of *Following*. It alters the *Fourth* following the *Second*, refusing to cling to one fixed following—this is why it is \"upright and auspicious.\" How much more so when abandoning the distant to draw near? \"Going out to associate brings success\"—why then abandon this to seek afar? The *Second* surpasses the *Third* to follow the *Fourth*, yet though following involves change and movement, the auspiciousness of \"following the upright\" is already attained from the outset. The *Second* also knows the *Third* to be a \"young one,\" unfit to bind to, and the *First* to be a \"great man,\" unfit to lose. Though no harm lies in holding both, how can the circumstances allow it? Thus, the *Six in the Second* would rather not lose this than bind its will to that. As for the *Third*, it now regards the *Nine in the Fourth* as a \"great man,\" and so would rather bind to the great man and lose the young one.\n\nAt the time of *Following*, the will is set on capture, striving to gain. If one does not follow with the four virtues of *yuan* (origination), *heng* (prosperity), *li* (benefit), and *zhen* (uprightness), not only will there be no gain, but there will also be blame—how can one follow then? The *Fifth* is in the central and upright position, of the same body as the *Fourth*. It naturally possesses the sincere joy of *Dui* (Lake). The *Fourth*, as a minister following the ruler, even if following results in capture, need not be spoken of. Though it may seem improper for a minister to \"capture\" while the ruler speaks, who knows that the *Fourth* is truly sincere with the *Fifth*? That it truly shares the same Dao? Moreover, the *Fourth* clearly knows that following the *Fifth* can bring success. Thus, the *Fifth* surely wishes it to follow. Even if there is capture, what inauspiciousness could there be? Observe the times, examine oneself, and simply follow—that is all.\n\nOnly the *Six at the Top* acts improperly, unable to sincerely delight the world and make others joyfully follow. Instead, it binds and restrains them, further securing them to compel compliance—how could this succeed? The king, using excellent rites to draw near the state, moves and brings joy to the people. Even the spirits of the Western Mountain may be employed in sacrifice—how could they be like ministers? Why bind and restrain them? King Wen’s lament runs deep. This hexagram is entirely set forth for this line.\n\nThe *First Nine*, \"going out to associate,\" immediately gains a companion of success, not waiting to lose one before gaining another—hence it is said, \"nothing is lost.\" As for the *Second* and *Third*, binding to the young one must lose the great man, and binding to the great man must lose the young one—how can both be held at once? Only joy suffices. Only the four virtues of *yuan*, *heng*, *li*, and *zhen* suffice. To follow without these is to invite blame—better not to follow.\n\nFang Shihua said: *Following* takes the meaning of \"following the times.\" Since the times have no fixed origin, the six lines have no fixed following—sometimes binding is possible, sometimes abandoning is possible—all follows the times.\n\n**Appendix**\nJiao Gan said: The Han Emperor Gaozu and Xiang Yu are its clear proof.\nZhou Yan said: The lines take \"following the times in movement,\" while the Great Image takes \"following the times in rest.\" Movement and rest do not violate the times—this is why the meaning of \"following the times\" is great.\n\n---\n**Mountain Wind Decay (Gu)**\n*Gu*: *Yuan heng*, beneficial to cross the great river. Three days before *jia*, three days after *jia*.\n**Xiang**: *Gu*—firm above and yielding below, *Xun* (Wind) yielding and *Gen* (Mountain) stopping. *Gu*: *yuan heng*, and the world is ordered. \"Beneficial to cross the great river\"—proceeding has purpose. \"Three days before *jia*, three days after *jia*\"—ending then beginning, the way of heaven.\n**Image**: Wind beneath the mountain—*Gu*. The noble one rouses the people and nurtures virtue.\n\n**First Six**: Correcting the father’s decay—having a son, the father incurs no blame. Dangerous in the end, auspicious.\n**Xiang**: \"Correcting the father’s decay\"—the intent is to succeed the father.\n\n**Nine in the Second**: Correcting the mother’s decay—cannot be upright.\n**Xiang**: \"Correcting the mother’s decay\"—attaining the central way.\n\n**Nine in the Third**: Correcting the father’s decay—slight regret, no great blame.\n**Xiang**: \"Correcting the father’s decay\"—in the end, no blame.\n\n**Six in the Fourth**: Indulging the father’s decay—proceeding brings remorse.\n**Xiang**: \"Indulging the father’s decay\"—proceeding gains nothing.\n\n**Six in the Fifth**: Correcting the father’s decay—using praise.\n**Xiang**: \"Correcting the father’s decay using praise\"—succeeding with virtue.\n\n**Top Nine**: Not serving kings and lords, holding one’s affairs in high esteem.\n**Xiang**: \"Not serving kings and lords\"—the will is worthy of emulation.\n\n**Mountain Wind Decay (Gu)**\n*Gu*: firm above, yielding below. Above and below do not communicate; below yields, above stops—neither above nor below acts. Alas, this is why decay is complete. Only when there is no communication does decay form—thus, one knows that its initial order must have been great communication. Hence, \"ending then beginning\"—is *yuan heng* not fitting? Only when there is no action does decay form—thus, one knows that its initial order must have involved action. Hence, \"ending then beginning\"—is crossing the river not beneficial? Therefore it is said: *Gu*: *yuan heng*, beneficial to cross the great river. Three days before *jia*, three days after *jia*. Three days before *jia*: *zi*, *xu*, *shen*. Three days after *jia*: *wu*, *chen*, *yin*. Since there is a \"before *jia*,\" there must naturally be an \"after *jia*.\"\n\nHaving \"after *jia*,\" there naturally follows \"before *jia*\" once more. After reverting to before, ending reverts to beginning—such is the movement of Heaven. Thus, how could *yuan* ever decay? Should those who govern *gu* not act likewise?\n\nIf one does not rest complacent in *gu*, one will naturally understand its origins, and *gu* may be governed. There is no other technique, no other *jia*. Yet if there is no other Dao, then this is how the sage governs *gu*.\n\nNow, governing *gu* in the world is the same as governing *gu* in a single household. Thus, the six lines focus solely on the work of rectifying *gu*. Though what they rectify differs, none take \"being able to rectify\" as their task, nor \"willingness to rectify\" as virtue. One cannot be leisurely or indulgent in accomplishing the rectification of one’s parents’ *gu*.\n\nThus, to the point of endangering oneself in rectifying one’s father—though perilous, one ultimately attains good fortune. Even if rectifying one’s father leads to regret, the heart remains ultimately blameless. Thus, one who can rectify *gu* must be a filial son, without doubt.\n\nAlas! Ruler and parent are as one household; there is no division between state and family. One who can rectify the household can rectify the state; one who can rectify one’s father can rectify one’s ruler. Yet世人 often hasten to mend their household’s *gu* while treating their state as a mere lodging. This is because there are ministers who do not serve kings and lords, who may claim lofty ideals and refuse to engage with the world. But there are no sons who do not serve their parents—thus, they cannot but inherit their fathers’ legacy and rectify *gu*.\n\nThat one does not serve kings and lords may still be spoken of. Yet how many in the world truly do not serve kings and lords? Now that all are ministers to a single king and lord, can one still claim lofty ideals and refuse to take rectifying *gu* as one’s duty?\n\nThus, the sage speaks solely of the *gu* of parents to make it deeply personal and inescapable for all. The task is the work of rectifying *gu*—if one claims lofty ideals, one naturally does not act. Hence, it is said: \"loftily esteeming one’s task.\" The top line, *nine at the top*, is at the summit of the hexagram, hence \"lofty.\" It also draws from the height of *Gen* Mountain, hence \"loftily esteeming.\"\n\nThe duty of a child to a parent is something the heart cannot shirk; the duty of a minister to a ruler is something that cannot be evaded between Heaven and Earth. Yet to be named for \"loftily esteeming\" and not serving kings and lords is to be one who rebels against righteousness, disrupts constancy, and inverts the proper order. The sage merely takes what can be emulated.\n\nThose who covet such a reputation say: \"The aspiration may be imitated, but the words—can they be imitated?\" If the aspiration is truly imitable, then who will attend to the affairs of ruler and parent? Alas! A minister who does not serve his ruler has no ruler; a child who does not serve his parent has no parent—this is the path to great chaos. What does the sage take from this?\n\nFang Shihua said: The first line receives the yang below the father; the second line holds yin, representing the later mother. The third line again rides yang, representing the later father; the fourth line again rides yang, while the fifth line once more receives the yang above—thus, all share the image of the father.\n\nRectifying the mother’s *gu* cannot be done through steadfastness. To say it cannot be done through correctness is to grasp the mean in rectifying *gu*. The *nine in the second place* cannot be steadfast in its rectification of *gu*, for its approach differs from the first and third lines. As for *six in the fifth place*, it not only does not rectify its father through correctness but also employs praise to gently persuade him—this is the very Dao that leads to *gu*.\n\nThis is what is meant by \"receiving with virtue,\" what is called \"following the highest.\" The subtlety of imperceptible transformation—even the father may not realize it. This is what it means to be able to rectify *gu*, not to indulge it.\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Zizhan said: A vessel long unused breeds insects—this is called *gu*. A person long indulgent breeds illness—this is called *gu*. To take the world as having no affairs and refuse to act is to later be overwhelmed by affairs. This is why *gu* becomes a matter of concern. Vessels should be used constantly, the body should be labored constantly, and the world should always be engaged in affairs. The disaster of *gu* does not arise in a single day.\n\nHuman nature has no greater fear than hardship. Once the world is governed, to still make \"crossing the river\" one’s task is to dread its decay! Shi Baihuo said: The days follow the six *jia*, ending and beginning again like a ring without end—such is the movement of Heaven, the reason the workings of creation never decay.\n\nShao Guoxian said: To govern *gu* is called *gu*, just as to govern disorder is called disorder, to govern desolation is called desolation.\n\nZixia said: Facing affairs with dedication sharpens the will, thus avoiding blame—this is the meaning of \"having affairs.\"\n\nZheng Kangcheng said: A son altering his father’s way may begin perilously but end auspiciously, for though the act may not be smooth, the intent is.\n\n\"Indulging the father’s *gu*\"—proceeding brings no gain.\n\nCai Jiefu said: Why say \"there is no *gu* like *gu*\"?\n\nLiu Yongxiang said: \"Indulging the father’s *gu*\" is the inability to rectify *gu*. The lines take \"being able to rectify\" as their task, though what they rectify differs. Yet the emphasis on the mother’s \"cannot be steadfast\" and the father’s \"employing praise\" also has its Dao. Why? The affairs of parents must not be ignored. The minister’s duty to the ruler is likewise.\n\nJiao Ruohou said: The fifth line of *Gu* all speak of \"rectifying the father’s *gu*.\" As for the top line, it states \"not serving kings and lords.\" At the end of the hexagram, speaking of one family, this refers to the days when parents are in their dotage, and one does not go out to take office. When Master Zeng resided in Lu, Qi sought to appoint him as a minister. Master Zeng said: \"Living with aged parents, I cannot bear to be far from my kin. To be made another’s servant—can this be my will?\" Wang Ji said: *Gen*’s firmness resides above, *Xun*’s softness below; the upper is haughty and cannot descend, while the lower is base and cannot ascend to meet it. Stopping yet yielding—this is how *gu* is formed. The noble person has a Dao for governing *gu*. The *gu* of the people’s hearts arises from idleness, decay, and neglect, leaving them unaware of how to rouse themselves. \"Rousing\" means to stir and inspire. Thus it is said: \"Renew the people.\" This is not merely about setting rules or issuing commands; it is about addressing the root. It is like a skilled physician treating illness: \"rousing\" is to expel external pathogens, while \"nurturing\" is to cultivate the original *qi*. Wind speaks of \"rousing,\" mountain speaks of \"nurturing.\" Zhou Yan said: \"Rousing the people\" is to awaken their base and yielding ailments. \"Nurturing virtue\" is to transform their careless stagnation. *The Yi’s* Upper Canon, Scroll Two, concludes here.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram 19: Lin (Approach)**\n\n*Lin*: Originating, prosperous, beneficial, and correct. As for the eighth month, there will be misfortune.\n\n**The Judgment** says: *Lin*—firmness gradually grows. Joyful and compliant, firmness centered and responsive—great prosperity through correctness is the Dao of Heaven. As for the eighth month and misfortune, decline will not be long in coming.\n\n**The Image** says: Above the marsh is earth—*Lin*. The noble person, in teaching, thinks without limit and in nurturing, protects the people without bounds.\n\n**Line 1 (Nine in the first place):** Mutual approach—correct and auspicious.\n**The Image** says: Mutual approach—correct and auspicious, for the will is rightly enacted.\n\n**Line 2 (Nine in the second place):** Mutual approach—auspicious, with nothing unbeneficial.\n**The Image** says: Mutual approach—auspicious with nothing unbeneficial, for it does not yet follow commands.\n\n**Line 3 (Six in the third place):** Sweet approach—nothing beneficial. If one worries over it, there will be no blame.\n**The Image** says: Sweet approach—its position is not proper. If one worries over it, blame will not last.\n\n**Line 4 (Six in the fourth place):** Utmost approach—no blame.\n**The Image** says: Utmost approach—no blame, for its position is proper.\n\n**Line 5 (Six in the fifth place):** Knowing approach—fitting for the great lord, auspicious.\n**The Image** says: Fitting for the great lord—this means acting from the center.\n\n**Line 6 (Six at the top):** Sincere approach—auspicious, no blame.\n**The Image** says: The auspiciousness of sincere approach lies in the will’s inward focus.\n\n---\n\nThe hexagram *Earth over Marsh: Lin* depicts two yang lines approaching four yin lines. The four words—originating, prosperous, beneficial, and correct—solely praise the growth of the two yang. The six words \"as for the eighth month, there will be misfortune\" then consider the decline of the two yang. To praise their growth yet immediately fear their decline, to extol them without end yet follow with dread of misfortune—how earnest is the sage’s heart in upholding yang! Thus the hexagram’s words and the *Judgment* speak of *Lin* in this way.\n\n**Line 1 (Nine in the first place):** \"Mutual approach\" refers to approaching the fourth line. The first delights in the fourth’s compliance, approaching it through resonance. The fourth, being utmost in its approach to the marsh, and the first, as its minister, with one yang line approaching, does so only through the Dao of resonance and response. Thus it is called \"mutual approach.\" Though the first is yang, it approaches with correctness; though the fourth is yin, it responds with rectitude. Is it not fitting that \"mutual approach\" is correct and auspicious?\n\n**Line 2 (Nine in the second place):** Not only is it joyful and compliant, but it is also firm, centered, and responsive. Thus it is also called \"mutual approach,\" also \"auspicious,\" and further \"nothing unbeneficial.\" The one it responds to is the fifth line, the knowing approach of the great lord—how could it compare to the fourth line? Yet though it is said to be \"nothing unbeneficial,\" the *Judgment* reverses this and says it \"does not yet follow commands.\" Why? The fifth line, dwelling in the center of *Kun*’s compliance, only knows to listen and obey the second. Thus, for the second, it is \"nothing unbeneficial.\" The second, approaching with yang virtue, does not necessarily follow every command of the fifth. Thus, for the fifth, it is fitting for the great lord.\n\nYet if the fifth merely receives in compliance while the second responds from the center, were it only a matter of following commands, they would not be two distinct matters. How could this bring great illumination to the fifth? The fifth also knows that the second’s centeredness cannot be momentarily abandoned, and to listen and obey exclusively with wisdom while occupying the honored position—this is no empty deference. Only thus can it enable the noble one to grow daily, which mere compliance cannot. This is what is meant by “Shun was of great wisdom.” Shun applied his centeredness to the people, and his wisdom thereby became great. If the fifth line enacts its centeredness toward the second, how could it not be fitting for the great lord?\n\nThe sixth line in the third place is neither centered nor correct, positioned at the mouth of *Dui*. It knows only a single flavor of sweet compliance. If it seeks compliance from above yet above does not comply, what use is its sweetness? Sweetness turns to worry, sweetness reverts to bitterness—this is the inevitable course of events. This is why its worry incurs no blame. Though it was originally said that sweetness has “nothing for which it is beneficial,” it is in fact because the two yang lines approach so closely to the sixth in the third place that it unknowingly generates anxiety. Above, it knows only *dun* approaching. From its position above the earth, seeing the fifth as the one who knows approach, the second also has this intention. Within, the second sees the fourth’s arrival as approach. The first also has this intention. Within the first, the two yang lines’ approach to this place becomes even more earnest—hence it is also called *dun lin*.\n\nThe *lin* hexagram’s “originating, penetrating, beneficial, and correct” do not derive from this; rather, this is called “great penetration through correctness, the Way of Heaven.” **Appendix:** Yang Jian says: “As for ‘in the eighth month there is misfortune,’ this refers to the month when the two yin lines grow.” *Lin* is the growth of two yang lines; *gu* is the growth of two yin lines. Every hexagram’s change spans seven, hence *Fu* says, “After seven days, it returns.” Now *Lin* speaks of the eighth month because, counting from the beginning of the first yang, *Fu*, *Lin*, *Tai*, *Dazhuang*, *Guai*, *Qian*, *Gou*, and *Dun* make eight. Yin is called “month,” yang “day.” Xiong Guo says: “‘Arriving at *lin*’ refers to the interchange of *Kun* and *Dui*, earth and marsh approaching one another.” *Dun*, according to the *Erya*, means “like an overturned *dun* vessel”; in the Jiangdong region, a high mound of earth is called *dun*. The upper line resides at the end of two earth lines, resembling a high place. *Dun* has seven meanings.\n\nWang Ji says: “Nothing approaches as earth approaches water, hence marsh above earth is *lin*.” Earth restrains water, which seems effortless. Yet if pressed by peril and constriction, it bursts forth in all directions, breaking only when exhausted. If treated with generosity, it gathers into a marsh. The noble one’s relation to the people is likewise. The people of the Three Dynasties never forgot the inexhaustible beneficence of the former kings’ teachings. Marsh is the image of storing things without limit; earth is the image of containing things.\n\n**Hexagram 20: Guan (Observation)**\n*Xun* below *Kun* above\n*Guan*: Washing hands but not yet presenting the offering—with sincerity, it is manifestly thus.\n\n**Judgment:**\nGreat observation is above. Compliant and yielding, centered and correct, it observes the world. *Guan*: washing hands but not yet presenting the offering—with sincerity, it is manifestly thus. Below, they observe and are transformed. Observing the divine Way of Heaven, the four seasons do not deviate. The sage establishes teaching through the divine Way, and the world submits.\n\n**Image:**\nWind moves over the earth—*Guan*. The former kings toured the provinces, observed the people, and established teaching.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Line 1 (Initial Six):** Childish observation. For the petty person, no blame; for the noble one, regret.\n**Image:** The initial six’s childish observation is the way of the petty person.\n\n**Line 2 (Six in the second place):** Peeping observation. Beneficial for a woman’s correctness.\n**Image:** Peeping observation for a woman’s correctness—this is also shameful.\n\n**Line 3 (Six in the third place):** Observing my life, advancing and retreating.\n**Image:** Observing my life, advancing and retreating—this does not lose the Way.\n\n**Line 4 (Six in the fourth place):** Observing the state’s splendor. Beneficial to be a guest of the king.\n**Image:** Observing the state’s splendor—esteeming the guest.\n\n**Line 5 (Nine in the fifth place):** Observing my life. The noble one incurs no blame.\n**Image:** Observing my life—observing the people.\n\n**Line 6 (Top Nine):** Observing their life. The noble one incurs no blame.\n**Image:** Observing their life—the aspiration is not yet at peace.\n\n**Hexagram 20: Wind over Earth, Observation**\nThis hexagram has four yin lines below, symbolizing ministers and the people—those who observe from below. Two yang lines above symbolize the noble one—those who observe the world. Only by having the means to observe the world can one become the world’s observation. Yet though the two yang lines above both constitute “great observation above” and both rest centered and correct with *Kun* bearing *Xun*, only the nine in the fifth place can observe with centered correctness. This is why it is named *Guan*.\n\nThe Master says: In observation, sound and scent are both absent—it is just like Heaven. What does Heaven say? Yet the four seasons proceed. The observer, considering himself divine, what teaching can be established? What transformation can be achieved? No teaching can be established, hence “establishing teaching through the divine Way”; no transformation can be achieved, hence “through the divine Way, the world submits.”\n\nNow observe the observer: just as he washes his hands before the guest arrives, before the offering is presented, those below observe and are transformed by the manifest sincerity, as if already solemnly facing a great guest. Thus the nine in the fifth place is truly the divine Way. To observe the nine in the fifth is truly to observe Heaven. Yet those below who observe the fifth do so as Heaven. What the fifth observes is the self. Those below who observe the fifth do so as the divine; what the fifth observes in the self is the people. My life, the people’s life—there is no distinction. This is called the world’s peace. The people, unknowing and unperceiving, and the fifth, without sound or scent, naturally communicate without words, and those below observe and are transformed.\n\nYet those who observe and those who are observed do not transform uniformly. Without uniformity, each follows their own depth and cannot be the same. Thus the six in the fourth place, as the ruler of *Xun*, draws near to the nine in the fifth and advances to observe the state’s splendor, becoming a beneficial guest of the king.\n\nHerein lies the observation that effects transformation—is this not what is meant by \"those below observe and are transformed\"? The nine in the third place, too, can observe my life, yet it does not rashly advance to behold the state’s splendor, for the third has not lost the Dao. Those below it, however, know only to observe the fifth, gazing upon mere appearances without perceiving the truth, seeing only the small without grasping the great—how then could they comprehend the noble one’s freedom from blame? Though they may not yet speak of transformation, one cannot say their hearts do not submit to the fifth. Thus, only by combining the observations of the four yin lines can one recognize the nine in the fifth as the true spirit of the Dao, not easily fathomed or known.\n\nAs for the nine in the top place, its aspirations remain unsettled, and \"my life\" persists as a distinction—this is not the great observation of the Dao. Though it, too, is a noble one free from blame, it is far from the centered rectitude of the nine in the fifth. Therefore, only the six in the fourth place can serve as the master of transformation, and only the nine in the fifth can serve as the master of observation.\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Shi’s explanation: When the great vessel moves, the people follow; without words, things are understood—this is the Dao of observation. When the sage governs through the spirit of the Dao, rewards, ranks, punishments, and penalties exist yet are unused.\n\nXiong Guo’s note: Zheng Xuan said: The feudal lords present scholars to the Son of Heaven, and ministers present scholars to their lord, honoring them as guests with ritual. Only the host washes and offers drink to the guest, and the guest washes and toasts the host, while disciples arrange the offerings. Now, in the six lines of *Guan*, all lack the meaning of sacrifice, revealing only the text of observing the state and serving as the king’s guest.\n\nThe *Shuowen* states: The six in the second place, yin and yielding within, though corresponding with the fifth, is separated by the third and fourth—like a woman within the gate peering outward.\n\nWu Youqing said: The first line, yang in position, resembles a young boy. The second, yin in position, resembles a girl. The third refers to itself as \"I.\" The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is the daily generation of life. The six in the third place stands at the top of the lower trigram, near *Xun*. *Xun* signifies advance and retreat, so the six in the third observes \"my life\" to examine its learning, like the saying, \"I have not yet proven this.\"\n\nYang Jian said: Zixia excelled in discussing subtleties, and after Confucius’ death, believing a lord resembled the sage, he sought to serve him as he had served Confucius, pressuring Zengzi. Only Zengzi could not be swayed—only he could avoid the shame of reckless observation. It is also said: The six in the third place stands at the limit of the lower trigram, poised to ascend to the upper trigram—this is the moment of advance and retreat. With the six in the third’s symbol of advance and retreat, the six in the fourth advances to observe the state’s splendor.\n\nWang Jibai: Wind moves over the earth, touching all things—this is the image of comprehensive observation. The former kings, wishing to influence the world, established the institution of imperial tours. Whether conducting annual inspections or quinquennial assemblies, they harmonized seasons and months, standardized pitch pipes, measures, weights, and balances, commanded grand masters to present poetry to observe the people’s customs, and examined market prices to discern their likes and dislikes. Investigating local practices, they established teachings to instruct where differences arose: using ritual to distinguish extravagance (as in Cao) and exemplifying frugality (as in Wei), or demonstrating propriety to unify morality and harmonize customs.\n\n☰ below ☲ above\n*Shihe*: Smooth and prosperous.\n\n**Favorable for administering legal judgments.**\n\n*The Image* says: Within the jaws lies an object—this is *Shihe* (Biting Through). Biting through brings prosperity. Hard and soft are divided; movement brings clarity. Thunder and lightning unite to manifest brilliance. The yielding attains the center and ascends; though not in its proper position, it is favorable for legal judgments.\n\n*The Image* says: Thunder and lightning in *Shihe*—the former kings thereby clarified punishments and enforced laws.\n\n**First Nine:** Shackles cover the toes, yet no blame.\n*The Image* says: Shackles cover the toes—movement is restrained.\n\n**Six in the Second:** Biting through soft flesh, the nose is lost, yet no blame.\n*The Image* says: Biting through soft flesh, the nose is lost—this is riding upon the firm.\n\n**Six in the Third:** Biting through dried meat, one encounters poison; a minor regret, yet no blame.\n*The Image* says: Encountering poison—this is due to an improper position.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Biting through dried lungs, one obtains a metal arrow. Favorable to persist through hardship—auspicious.\n*The Image* says: Favorable to persist through hardship—auspicious, yet its brilliance is not yet fully realized.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Biting through dried meat, one obtains yellow gold. Perseverance brings danger, yet no blame.\n*The Image* says: Perseverance brings danger yet no blame—this is due to proper attainment.\n\n**Top Nine:** Carrying shackles that cover the ears—misfortune.\n*The Image* says: Carrying shackles that cover the ears—hearing is no longer clear.\n\n**Fire below, Thunder above: *Shihe***\n\nCheng Zhengshu says: *Shi* means to bite; *he* means to close. With an object in the mouth, one must bite before closing. The hexagram’s upper and lower lines are both firm, while the center is yielding—this is the image of jaws. Moreover, a single firm line obstructs within, forming the image of an object in the jaws that cannot be closed without biting. Hence the name *Shihe*.\n\nYang Zhongli says: *Shihe* is the hexagram of removing obstructions. Legal judgments serve to investigate and seek the truth; when governance attains the truth, the world submits.\n\nLi Zisi says: Heaven and earth produce things, and whatever obstructs them must be struck and shattered by thunder and lightning. The sage governs the world, and whatever obstructs the people must be severed by legal judgments. Thus, *Shihe* removes the obstruction in the jaws, thunder and lightning remove obstructions among living things, and punishments remove obstructions in the world.\n\nZhu Zhonghui says: Biting through dried meat is harder than flesh yet easier than preserved meat. The lungs are yellow, the color of metal, and decisive in judgment.\n\nLiu Junbo says: *He* means to carry; *xiao* refers to wooden restraints. \"Covering the ears\" means the shackles rest upon the neck, obscuring the ears.\n\nXiong Guo says: In the *Rites of Zhou*, the *Laren* (preserved meat official), Zheng’s commentary states: Small creatures fully dried are called *teng*. *Teng* means \"evening\"—exposed in the morning and dried by evening. The *Marriage Rites* require fresh meat, hence the distinction.\n\nLiu Yongxiang says: The Fourth’s dried lungs are harder than preserved meat, yet its possession of the metal arrow’s talent aids in resolving the difficulty. Even in the initial stage of hardship, one must persist with caution to attain auspiciousness. Though auspiciousness is achieved, its brilliance remains incomplete. As Master Zeng said: \"When the truth is obtained, one should mourn and sympathize rather than rejoice.\" If there is no time even for mourning, how can there be brilliance? Thus, the Third’s encounter with poison leads to regret, and the Fifth must persevere through danger to avoid blame—what doubt remains?\n\nFang Shihua says: Every legal case arises from some obstruction causing dispute. If judgment fails to uncover the obstruction, the case cannot be easily resolved—like carving meat without first arranging the bones. *Shi* (biting) means to gnaw through the obstruction to resolve it. The bottom line symbolizes shackles covering the toes; the top line symbolizes shackles covering the ears. The Second, riding upon the firm, faces a difficult case—biting through flesh deeply enough to lose the nose means severing the bone, thus attaining the truth without blame. The Third, in an improper position, bites through preserved meat and encounters poison, incurring minor regret. Yet having personally bitten through it, there is still no blame. The Fourth, firm in virtue, bites through dried lungs and obtains a metal arrow (a tool for severing sinews). The Fifth, yielding yet central, bites through dried meat and obtains yellow gold—hence \"proper attainment.\" The Second, though riding upon the firm, is at the beginning, thus \"flesh.\" The Third corresponds to the Top Nine’s firmness, representing preserved meat of the whole bone. The Fourth is \"dried lungs,\" the Fifth \"dried meat\"—this is the distinction between the Nine and Six.\n\n**☲ below ☶ above**\n*Bi* (Adornment): Prosperous. Slightly favorable for advancing.\n\n*The Judgment* says: *Bi* is prosperous, for the yielding comes to adorn the firm—hence prosperity. The firm is divided and ascends to adorn the yielding, hence slightly favorable for advancing. This is the pattern of heaven. Cultivated brilliance at rest—this is the pattern of humanity. Observing the patterns of heaven, one examines the changes of the seasons; observing the patterns of humanity, one transforms and completes the world.\n\n*The Image* says: Fire beneath the mountain—*Bi*. The noble person thereby clarifies all affairs but does not dare to adjudicate legal cases.\n\n**First Nine:** Adorning the toes, one abandons the carriage and walks.\n*The Image* says: Abandoning the carriage and walking—righteously, one does not ride.\n\n**Six in the Second:** Adorning the beard.\n*The Image* says: Adorning the beard—this rises with the above.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** Adorned yet moistened, perseverance brings auspiciousness.\n*The Image* says: The auspiciousness of perseverance—none will ultimately overstep.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** Adorned yet radiant, a white horse soars. Not a bandit but a marriage alliance.\n*The Image* says: The Fourth, in its proper position yet suspicious. Not a bandit but a marriage alliance—ultimately without blame.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Adorning the hills and gardens, a bundle of silk—meager, yet ultimately auspicious.\n*The Image* says: The Fifth’s auspiciousness—there is joy.\n\n**Top Nine:** White adornment—no blame.\n*The Image* says: White adornment—no blame, for the above attains its aim.\n\n**Mountain below, Fire above: *Bi***\n\nOriginally, the lower was *Qian* (☰) and the upper *Kun* (☷). Now, one line from *Kun* descends to the center of *Qian*, transforming the firm into the brilliant *Li* (☲), while the yielding comes to adorn the firm.\n\nYet *Qian* is the firm thing—at its origin, it does not flow. Adorned with the brilliance of *Li*, it indeed flows; unadorned by the brilliance of *Li*, it also flows. For it follows the yielding in adornment, yet its flow does not depend on adornment—only because adornment also flows is it said: *Bi* flows.\n\nWhen the middle line of *Qian* is further divided and ascends to the top of *Kun*, the yielding transforms into the firmness of *Gen* Mountain, and the firm rises to adorn the yielding. Yet *Kun* is the yielding thing—it awaits *Qian* to advance, for it cannot go forth alone. If one were to adorn it solely with the firmness of *Gen* Mountain, then wherever it went would ultimately prove unprofitable. Thus it is also said: \"Slight profit in having somewhere to go.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"The intermingling of yin and yang, the blending of firm and yielding—these are the natural transformations of the *Qian* Dao, which is called the patterns of Heaven. Without the patterns of Heaven, how could the four seasons alternate and display their brilliance in the sky? Yet the inner trigram is *Li*, brilliant, while the outer is *Gen*, still—this is the image of brilliance coming to a halt, of stillness without adornment, which is called the patterns of humanity. Without the patterns of humanity, how could the world be transformed and all return to the primal adornment of white? The responsibility of primal color lies in white adornment. Thus, without observing the patterns of Heaven, one cannot know the spontaneity of transformation, which is not something human effort can achieve. Without observing the patterns of humanity, one cannot know that humans can surpass Heaven, that the sage can assist where Heaven falls short—and the achievement of *Gen*’s stillness is great indeed.\n\nTherefore, the first line is firm and occupies the lower second position. It would adorn its toes with brilliance, yet initially, it is contrary to principle—abandoning the carriage to go on foot. Though its edges may seem adorned, in truth it halts itself and cannot be adorned. Thus, the second line alone initiates adornment for the third. How could it know that the third, being firm in the upper position, would, like a beard moistened by proximity, remain steadfast in its firmness and eternal correctness? The second also halts itself and ultimately cannot add adornment.\n\nThe flow of *Bi* is to be observed in the first and third lines. As for the topmost line, it is truly white adornment. *Gen* is the mountain, also resembling the recluse of hills and gardens. Though the fifth line, the yielding ruler at the center, willingly receives adornment from the hills and gardens, and though its bundle of silk is meager—making it seem stingy and unadorned—there is still adornment present, so it does not yet qualify as white adornment. Why? The elder of the hills and gardens, the old man bearing his staff, what use has he for a bundle of silk? Yet if he does not exalt the topmost line, he too will ultimately find joy. Since the fifth has joy, the top attains its aim—what doubt remains?\n\nThe fourth, however, cannot escape doubt, for it occupies a position of pure yin. Yet it too is swiftly turning white. *Qian* is the horse, and it soars white. Not taking the above as a bandit but as a marriage alliance, it daily draws nearer to white adornment. Ultimately without blame—what doubt remains? Its profit in having somewhere to go is like this—is this not the firm rising to adorn the yielding?\n\nThus do I know that wherever yang firmness resides, the yielding truly profits from it and receives its adornment. To say that the yielding can adorn the firm—is there such a principle? Therefore, though the whole world follows the latecomers, the Master alone follows the rustic. Who could adorn him? Even after a thousand or a hundred years, adornment cannot be added—how much less in his own time? Alas.\n\nLord Wang Ji states: Beneath the mountain there is fire, its brightness illuminating all things. Grasses and trees glow in mutual radiance—this is the image of *Bi* (Adornment). The noble person, observing this image of luminous illumination, brings clarity to all governance yet dares not rely on it to adjudicate legal cases. Cultivating governance is how civil patterns (*wen*) are perfected, but in the administration of justice, what matters is the truth of human feelings. If adornment is applied, the truth of those feelings is obscured; thus, one dares not use civil patterns to decide cases.\n\nSu Shi’s *General Explanations of the Hexagrams*:\n*Qian* transforms into *Li*, *Kun* into *Gen*—this is the configuration of yin and yang, the workings of number. \"Cultural brilliance restrained\" (*wen ming yi zhi*) is the virtue of *Li* and *Gen*. The dynamics of configuration and number unfold as Heaven bestows its virtue upon humanity.\n\nThe *Yijing* speaks of the mutual exchange of firm and yielding, of ascent and descent, but its most prominent expression is in the *Tuan* commentary on *Bi*. Hence, scholars have long debated the transformations that give rise to it, claiming that *Tai* transforms into *Bi*—a great confusion. A single hexagram may transform into sixty-three others; why should *Bi* alone be singled out? Scholars know only that *Tai* becomes *Bi*, but how do they know that *Bi* does not become *Tai*?\n\nAll the *Yijing*’s references to the mutual exchange of firm and yielding derive from *Qian* and *Kun*. *Qian* bestows one yang upon *Kun*, transforming one of its yin lines to produce the three sons, each with one yang and two yin. In all hexagrams of the three sons that speak of \"firmness coming,\" it is clear that these originally belonged to *Kun*, and *Qian* came to transform them. *Kun* bestows one yin upon *Qian*, transforming one of its yang lines to produce the three daughters, each with one yin and two yang. In all hexagrams of the three daughters that speak of \"yielding coming,\" it is clear that these originally belonged to *Qian*, and *Kun* came to transform them. Thus, all such references pertain to hexagrams where the three sons and three daughters meet. In hexagrams where this is not the case, such language does not appear.\n\nThe *Tuan* commentary on *Gu* states: \"The firm ascends while the yielding descends.\"\nThe *Tuan* on *Bi* states: \"The yielding comes to adorn the firm, dividing the firm above to adorn the yielding below.\"\nThe *Tuan* on *Xian* states: \"The yielding ascends while the firm descends.\"\nThe *Tuan* on *Heng* states: \"The firm ascends while the yielding descends.\"\nThe *Tuan* on *Sun* states: \"Diminishing below to augment above.\"\nThe *Tuan* on *Yi* states: \"Diminishing above to augment below.\"\nThese six are chosen as they arise in their particular contexts. Of the eighteen hexagrams where the three sons and three daughters meet, why are only these six singled out? The answer lies in the Sage’s multifaceted approach to selecting hexagrams: sometimes by image, sometimes by line, sometimes by transformation, and sometimes by the mutual exchange of firm and yielding.\n\nWhen selecting by image: *Heaven and Water moving in opposition* exemplifies *Song* (Conflict).\nWhen selecting by line: *The sixth three stepping on a tiger’s tail* exemplifies caution.\nWhen selecting by transformation: *Something in the jaws* exemplifies *Shi He* (Biting Through).\nWhen selecting by the mutual exchange of firm and yielding: *Bi* (Adornment) is the example.\nThe mutual exchange of firm and yielding is but one method among many for selecting hexagrams. When it is chosen, the text speaks of it; when it is not, the text remains silent. One should not be perplexed by this.\n\n---\n*Kun* below, *Gen* above: *Bo* (Splitting Apart). \"Unfavorable to have somewhere to go.\"\nThe *Tuan* states: *Bo* means splitting apart, the yielding transforming the firm. \"Unfavorable to have somewhere to go\"—the petty person grows strong. \"Following and halting\"—observing the image. The noble person values the waxing and waning of the full and the empty, the movement of Heaven.\n\nThe *Xiang* states: \"The mountain clings to the earth—*Bo*. The ruler above thickens the foundation below to secure the dwelling.\"\n**First Six:** \"Splitting apart the bed at the legs—disdaining constancy, misfortune.\"\nThe *Xiang* states: \"Splitting apart the bed at the legs—diminishing what is below.\"\n**Six in the Second:** \"Splitting apart the bed at the frame—disdaining constancy, misfortune.\"\nThe *Xiang* states: \"Splitting apart the bed at the frame—no one supports it.\"\n**Six in the Third:** \"Splitting apart—no blame.\"\nThe *Xiang* states: \"Splitting apart with no blame—losing connection to above and below.\"\n**Six in the Fourth:** \"Splitting apart the bed at the skin—misfortune.\"\nThe *Xiang* states: \"Splitting apart the bed at the skin—disaster is near.\"\n**Six in the Fifth:** \"A string of fish, favored by the palace women—ultimately without harm.\"\nThe *Xiang* states: \"Favored by the palace women—ultimately without blame.\"\n**Top Nine:** \"A great fruit uneaten. The noble person gains a carriage; the petty person strips the hut.\"\nThe *Xiang* states: \"The noble person gains a carriage—the people bear him. The petty person strips the hut—ultimately unusable.\"\n\n*Mountain and Earth Splitting Apart*:\nFang Shihua states: \"The yielding transforming the firm\" refers to the first through fifth lines. Formerly five yang, now five yin—this is *Bo* (splitting apart, decay). Yet one yang remains, destined to become the fruit of renewal. Thus, the Top Nine bears the image of \"a great fruit uneaten.\" Moreover, it is carried by the five yin, bearing the image of \"the noble person gains a carriage.\" As for \"the petty person strips the hut,\" it means that if the five yin reach this point without the Top Nine’s solitary yang above, they would be stripping their own shelter—what would cover them? Thus, the petty are deeply fortunate.\n\nYet when the petty grow strong, it is \"unfavorable to have somewhere to go.\" One should remain still and await the time, as night awaits day and winter awaits spring. It is not that winter and night are unnavigable, only to be fled. Where would one flee? Thus, from *Fu* (Return) to *Lin* (Approach), to *Tai* (Peace), to the brightness of *Da Zhuang* (Great Strength)—facing the light, one may proceed. From *Shi* (Beginning) to *Gu* (Decay), to *Pi* (Stagnation), to the darkness of *Bo* (Splitting Apart)—facing the dusk, one rests and does not proceed. This is the movement of Heaven. Thus, \"following and halting\" is how one observes the image of waxing and waning, the full and the empty—this is Heaven’s movement, in which the noble person does not interfere.\n\nThe First Six begins the transformation below, bearing the image of \"splitting apart the bed at the legs.\" Though it occupies the lowest position and remains humble, even as a yielding line, it may yet hold to constancy—how could misfortune be spoken of? Only when it disdains humility and scorns constancy, rushing toward misfortune, does this become evident. The Six in the Second is the same.\n\nWhen the second line transforms into a six, its image is \"stripping the forest to distinguish boundaries.\" Boundaries mark the division between above and below. Yet, abiding in the center and upholding correctness, it responds in harmony with the yang above. Though yielding, it remains steadfast—how could misfortune be spoken of? Only when it abandons centrality and correctness, scorning constancy to follow deviance, does misfortune first appear. Thus, these two lines—if they do not scorn constancy—will avoid great misfortune. Even in the time of *Bo* (Splitting Apart), occupying the second position after the first, the sage does not discard them.\n\nConsider the Six in the Third: though it loses the four yin lines above and below, it never dares lose the Nine in the Fifth, rightly responding to its steadfast correctness. In this way, though situated amid *Bo*, it naturally avoids blame—how could misfortune arise? From this, we know that the many yin await yang to find stability. If yang does not stabilize yin, it too is gravely imperiled. Yet if one clings to yang, though in *Bo*, what blame could there be?\n\nObserve further the Six in the Fifth: it leads the many yin to support the Nine in the Top, its image \"threading fish to court the palace’s favor.\" The sage rejoices in its initial lack of advantage yet trusts its ultimate outcome—no fault remains. Even if it transforms into yang, it still follows yang’s lead. Now, to emulate the Third and Fifth but instead follow the Six and Fourth is mistaken. Occupying a position close to the ruler, it courts imminent disaster—\"stripping the forest to the skin,\" willingly embracing harm—how foolish!\n\n**Appendix**\nCheng Zhengshu said: All yang lines have vanished; only the Nine in the Top remains. Like a great fruit untouched by men, it will become the seed of renewal. If the Nine in the Top were to transform, it would become pure *Kun*. Yet yang is at its utmost limit.\n\nCai Jiefu said: \"The noble one gains a chariot; the petty man strips a hut\"—these two principles do not operate together, nor do their omens coincide. If the noble one gains a chariot, the petty man too will keep his hut.\n\nWang Benhe said: The Nine in the Top stands above, borne by five yin—this is \"the noble one gaining a chariot.\" If the Nine in the Top were to transform into pure *Kun*, heaven would collapse and earth overturn—what shelter would the five yin have? This would be \"the petty man stripping a hut.\"\n\nZhu Zhonghui said: The mountain clings to the earth. Only because the earth is thick can it secure its place.\n\n*Zhen* below *Kun* above: *Fu* (Return): Smooth and free.\n\nEntrance and exit are supremely swift, and friends arrive without blame. Following the Way in reversal, the return comes in seven days. Propitious for setting forth.\n\n*The Tuàn* says: *Fu* (Return) is smooth and free. The firm returns, moving in accordance with compliance—thus entrance and exit are supremely swift, and friends arrive without blame. Following the Way in reversal, the return comes in seven days—this is the course of heaven. Propitious for setting forth, for the firm is growing. In *Fu* (Return), do we not see the heart of heaven and earth?\n\n*The Xiàng* says: Thunder within the earth—*Fu* (Return). The former kings, on the solstice, closed the passes; merchants and travelers did not journey, and the lord did not inspect the regions.\n\n**First Nine:** Returning from not far, there is no great regret—supremely auspicious.\n*The Xiàng* says: Returning from not far is for the cultivation of the self.\n\n**Six in the Second:** A joyful return—auspicious.\n*The Xiàng* says: The auspiciousness of a joyful return is in following the humane.\n\n**Six in the Third:** Frequent return—danger, but no blame.\n*The Xiàng* says: The danger of frequent return is such that, in principle, there is no blame.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** Returning alone in the midst of the way.\n*The Xiàng* says: Returning alone in the midst of the way is to follow the Dao.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Sincere return—no regret.\n*The Xiàng* says: Sincere return with no regret is to examine oneself from the center.\n\n**Top Six:** Deluded return—misfortune. There is calamity in mobilizing troops; in the end, great defeat. For the lord of the state, misfortune—even after ten years, he will not be able to campaign.\n*The Xiàng* says: The misfortune of deluded return is to reverse the lord’s Way.\n\n**Earth above Thunder—Fu (Return):** The firm returns, and in returning, there is smoothness. How is *Fu* able to be smooth and free? Before return, there is restless coming and going, with illness and obstruction. Once returned, entrance and exit are supremely swift. Before return, even if friends follow your thoughts, blame cannot be avoided. After return, though the five yin’s friends arrive, what blame is there? Naturally, all take my cultivation of the self as their model, follow the humane as their standard, blame themselves for danger, set their sights on solitary return, examine themselves in sincere return—unceasing until the *Qian* does not turn back. How could one willingly accept the misfortune of deluded return? Moreover, deluded return is utterly inadmissible. Thus, the extreme misfortune of deluded return is emphasized to warn the First Nine. Only by returning from not far, with no great regret, is supreme auspiciousness attained. \"No great regret\" means that, having turned back and returned home, there is no regret for having gone east or west—thus it is supremely auspicious. In return, there is supreme auspiciousness; in delusion, there is calamity and misfortune—what doubt is there? Therefore, the second line, being near the first, rests and follows the humane, and the second line’s return is thus achieved. In return, there is auspiciousness. The third line, not centered, frequently returns and is in danger, yet ultimately returns. In return, there is no blame. The fourth line, dwelling in the midst of the five yin yet responding alone to the first, is solitary return. In solitary return, there is auspiciousness—this goes without saying. The fifth line, dwelling in the center of the upper trigram and able to examine itself, is sincere return. Sincere return is not only the fourth line’s return. The first yang’s return is like this; the second, third, fourth, and fifth yin’s return is like that. This is the momentum of the world turning toward the humane—what place is there for the five yin’s friends to arrive? If, in this way, one does not return, then there will be no return at all. Either the yin has reached its extreme and does not revert, or delusion is too deep to awaken. Thus, the top line twice speaks of misfortune, and also of calamity and great defeat. For if one does not return and is deluded, then good fortune turns to misfortune—there is no regard. Even with the First Nine’s humane influence, what can be done? Fang Shihua said: When the yin is heavy, it strips the yang. Suddenly, in a single day, the original heart is seen again, and the brightness of yang returns. Thus it is said: *Fu* (Return) is smooth and free—the firm returns. The yang’s Way is not externally imposed; returning is how one recovers the Way. From *Zhun* to *Meng*, to *Pi*, to *Guan*, to *Bo*, to *Kun*, to *Fu*—seven days. Once the first yang returns, the five yang naturally grow—propitious for setting forth. *Bo* has just exhausted the yang, and *Fu* immediately follows, thus the First Nine is \"returning from not far.\" The Six in the Second follows the First Nine’s humane influence. Humane is to center and lower oneself, desiring to return with it—is this not a joyful return?\n\n**Appendix**\nQiu Xingke said: \"The firm returns\" speaks of the single firm line of *Bo* reaching the top, turning back below, and becoming *Fu*. \"The firm grows\" speaks of the single firm line of *Fu* advancing from below upward, becoming *Lin*, becoming *Tai*, and ultimately becoming *Qian*. Because it has departed and then comes back, there is smoothness. Because it has returned and then gradually grows, it is propitious for setting forth. \"The firm returns\" speaks of the very beginning of return; \"the firm grows\" speaks of after return.\n\nJin Rubai said: Observing *Fu* allows one to know the humane. The humane is the heart of heaven and earth in generating things—profound and ceaseless. The *Tuàn* speaks of *Fu* revealing the heart of heaven and earth, and the six lines all concern the affairs of the humane. The First Nine, \"returning from not far,\" corresponds to Yanzi—this is the Way of *Qian*. The nine obtains the first line of *Qian*. The second, \"joyful return with friends,\" corresponds to Fuzi, Min Sun, and their followers. The third, \"frequent return,\" is like the sun and moon. The fourth, \"returning alone,\" refers to Mencius, born a hundred years later, who alone privately admired the Master to follow the Dao. The fifth, \"sincere return,\" is the Way of *Kun*. The Six in the Fifth is the central line of *Kun*—perhaps Zengzi corresponds to this. The top, \"deluded return,\" is self-abandonment and self-neglect—this is the unhumane.\n\nWu Ziyi said: *Fu* reveals the heart of heaven and earth—not that *Fu* itself is the heart of heaven and earth.\n\nYang Tingxiu said: Frequent return is not dangerous; frequent transgression is dangerous. \"Danger, but no blame\" means the sage warns of frequent transgression yet opens the way for frequent return.\n\nWang Benhe said: Frequent return is frequent loss. If there were no loss, how could there be return? Thus, the sage both worries over frequent return and rejoices in it.\n\nWang Fusi said: The fourth line, with two yin above and two yin below, occupies its proper position and responds to the first—alone attaining return, complying with the Dao in reversion. Thus it is said: \"Returning alone in the midst of the way.\"\n\nCai Jiefu said: The fourth line, moving alone in the center to return, is like advancing amid the multitude of yin, turning back alone to follow yang—yielding yet attaining correctness.\n\nXue Juncai said: The auspiciousness of restful return lies in honoring humanity. Later generations, neglecting self-cultivation, thus fail to recognize the duty of drawing near to the worthy.\n\nXiong Guo said: Yu Fan called *Kun* the state and nation, hence the ruler’s ten-year misfortune.\n\nLi Dingzuo said: The number of *Kun* governs ten; the primal *qi* of *Qian* is ten, the primal *qi* of *Kun* is one—thus whenever ten is mentioned, it is the image of *Kun* reaching its end.\n\n**Hexagram 25: Wuwang (Innocence)**\n*Qian* below, *Zhen* above\n**Wuwang:** Primordial, penetrating, beneficial, and correct. If not correct, there will be misfortune; no advantage in having somewhere to go.\n\n**The Judgment** says: *Wuwang*—the firm comes from without and becomes master within. Movement and strength, firmness in the center with response—great penetration through correctness is the mandate of heaven. \"If not correct, there will be misfortune; no advantage in having somewhere to go.\" Where can one go in *Wuwang*? Heaven’s mandate does not protect—how can one act?\n\n**The Image** says: Thunder moves beneath heaven; all things partake of *Wuwang*. The former kings, in abundant response to the seasons, nurtured the myriad things.\n\n**First Nine:** *Wuwang*—going is auspicious.\n**The Image** says: Going in *Wuwang* attains the will.\n\n**Six in the Second:** Not plowing yet reaping, not weeding yet clearing—then advantageous to have somewhere to go.\n**The Image** says: \"Not plowing yet reaping\"—not yet enriched.\n\n**Six in the Third:** Disaster in *Wuwang*—someone ties an ox; a traveler gains it, the villagers suffer misfortune.\n**The Image** says: The traveler gains the ox; the villagers suffer misfortune.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Correctness is possible; no blame.\n**The Image** says: \"Correctness is possible; no blame\"—firmly possessing it.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** Illness in *Wuwang*—do not take medicine, and there will be joy.\n**The Image** says: Medicine in *Wuwang* must not be tried.\n\n**Top Nine:** *Wuwang*—acting brings misfortune; no advantage in having somewhere to go.\n**The Image** says: Acting in *Wuwang* brings the disaster of exhaustion.\n\n**Heaven and Thunder: Wuwang**\n*Wuwang* is primordial delusion. When truth is real and without delusion, then naturally there is primordial penetration, benefit, and correctness. Great penetration through correctness is the timing of heaven’s mandate. How could heaven’s mandate have delusion? Since heaven’s mandate is itself primordial delusion, the *Judgment* speaks of *Wuwang*, and the *Commentary* again speaks of heaven’s mandate. Heaven’s mandate is greatly penetrating and supremely correct. Those who call heaven’s mandate incorrect are deluded. Seeing specks in the eye, one perceives flowers in empty space. Without specks in the eye, how could there be flowers in empty space? How could heaven’s mandate ever be incorrect? Only because of specks does one see flowers in empty space; only because of delusion does one see heaven’s mandate as incorrect and disadvantageous to act. Not knowing to blame oneself but falsely claiming heaven’s mandate does not protect me—this is primordial delusion turning into outright delusion. How could any place one goes not be primordial delusion? Where could one go that is not the hidden arrangement of heaven’s mandate? If not for heaven’s mandate as primordial delusion, silently protecting and subtly assisting, one could not take a single step. Thus it is said: \"Heaven’s mandate does not protect—how can one act?\" Heaven’s protection is precisely the absence of deluded action. Alas, people are all deluded—thus they are protected yet do not know it.\n\nThe *Judgment* speaks of *Wuwang* as primordial, penetrating, beneficial, and correct—this is heaven, earth, and the myriad things sharing one primordial delusion. The *Image* speaks of thunder moving beneath heaven, all things partaking of *Wuwang*—this is heaven, earth, and the myriad things each having their own primordial delusion. Scholars may take this as proof that *Wuwang* is not delusion.\n\nThe first line, a single yang below, is thunder stirring at its inception—delusion is entirely dispelled. This is the moment when the solitary yang attains its will—where could one go that would not be auspicious? As for the second line, though thunder stirs below, delusion seems suddenly stilled. The sage still suspects its stinginess, thus reverses the phrasing to encourage it: \"If the second line can refrain from plowing yet reaping, not weeding yet clearing, then it will be advantageous to have somewhere to go.\" Yet its position is yielding, its nature yin—perhaps this is not yet certain. The Master, reading it, borrows the phrasing to rebuke it: \"The yin nature is stingy, constantly desiring wealth. Now the second line is not yet enriched—how could it refrain from 'not plowing yet reaping'?\" Alas! Considering the words of these two sages together, what then is expected of the second line?\n\nThe third line is three. One person ties an ox, one gains the ox, one loses the ox—there is gain and loss. Disaster is self-inflicted; though called *Wuwang*, what can be done? The fourth line, a *Qian* body dwelling below, is vast emptiness where nothing yet exists—thus it has not entered hesitation, has not been deluded by incorrectness, and can trust in the firm possession of heaven’s mandate, attaining correctness without blame. The fifth line, firm *Qian* centered and correct, should know what illness *Wuwang* could have. Trusting that medicine should not be tried, yet doubting due to the second line’s influence, it falsely suspects illness—this is delusion. The top line is precisely what is meant by \"not correct, there will be misfortune; no advantage in having somewhere to go.\" The body is within *Wuwang*, the heart transcends *Wuwang*—though it knows wealth cannot be attained, it does not know that exhaustion also brings disaster. Alas! How could one find someone like the first or fourth lines to discuss the meaning of *Wuwang* with?\n\nFang Shihua said: The firm comes from without and becomes master within—movement and strength, firmness in the center with response—this is great penetration through the correctness of heaven’s mandate. Great penetration through correctness—who commands this? The commander is heaven. How could heaven’s mandate have delusion? The first line, thunder’s master emerging from the earth with a single resounding crack, is the key to why the hexagram is called *Wuwang*. Its going is auspicious—how could it not attain its will? The second line, *Kun* yin governing wealth, *Kun* earth governing plowing, reaping, weeding, and clearing.\n\nThe third line, yin and soft without centeredness, thus suffers disaster from *wuwang* and delusion in gain and loss. Now, why is an ox suddenly tied, suddenly lost, and suddenly made for a traveler to obtain? This disaster arises from human action—how could it be called *wuwang*? The fourth line, a *Qian* body dwelling below, thus may hold to correctness without blame. Yet correctness is what all people inherently possess—it is not the fourth line’s correctness alone. The fifth line, centered and rightly positioned, is inherently *wuwang* and inherently aligned with correctness; yet by having a responsive relationship with the second line, it doubts itself as deluded—this is the illness of *wuwang*. If left untreated, it will heal on its own; if medicine is administered, the illness will worsen. Thus it is said: the remedy for *wuwang* must not be tested. To test it is to invite delusion, and the affliction of delusion will turn to disaster. The top line, excessively firm without centeredness, fails to recognize the *Qian* body’s inherent *wuwang*; driving it forward and forcing it in, it reaches the point of exhaustion—where is the benefit in going? In truth, it brings ruin upon itself and invites its own calamity. Appendix.\n\nBear Guo said: \"In farming, a field returning to grass after one year is called *miao* (sprouts); after three years of thorough weeding, it is called *hui* (gathering).\"\n\nWu Youqing said: \"The fifth line, firm and centered, suffers illness from *wuwang* when it has a responsive relationship. The sage’s response to things is like this: when they come, he illuminates them; when they depart, he does not retain them. This is no different from the illness of *wuwang*. Without rejecting external things, external things cannot burden him—why then resort to medicine?\"\n\n**Below *Qian*, above *Gen*: *Da Xu* (Great Accumulation).** **Auspicious to be correct.**\n**Not eating at home—good fortune.**\n**Auspicious to ford the great river.**\n\n**The *Tuan* says:** *Da Xu*: firmness, strength, sincerity, and brilliance—daily renewing its virtue. Firmness rises and esteems worthiness. It can restrain strength—this is great correctness. \"Not eating at home—good fortune\" means nurturing the worthy. \"Auspicious to ford the great river\" means responding to Heaven.\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** Heaven within the mountain—*Da Xu*. The noble person, by remembering the words and deeds of the past, accumulates virtue.\n\n**First Nine:** There is danger—beneficial to desist.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"There is danger—beneficial to desist\" means not courting disaster.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** The carriage sheds its shafts.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"The carriage sheds its shafts\"—centered, it has no fault.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** A fine horse gallops—beneficial to be correct amid hardship. Daily practice in charioteering and defense—beneficial to have somewhere to go.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Beneficial to have somewhere to go\"—it aligns with the will above.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** The young bull’s yoke—supremely auspicious.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Six in the Fourth—supremely auspicious\"—there is joy.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** The boar’s tusk—good fortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Six in the Fifth—good fortune\"—there is celebration.\n\n**Top Nine:** What thoroughfare of Heaven! Smoothness.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"What thoroughfare of Heaven!\"—the Dao greatly advances.\n\n**Mountain above Heaven: *Da Xu*.** *Gen* is firm and great. Nurturing the worthy is accumulation. What is meant by \"worthy\"? The three yang lines of *Qian*. *Qian* is firm, strong, sincere, and solid. The fourth and fifth lines are *Gen*. *Gen* shines brilliantly and daily renews its worthiness in this way. Thus, all are seen to be accumulated by the Top Nine, completing the greatness of what is accumulated. Yet the virtue of the Top Nine is truly sufficient to accumulate them. Its virtue is firmness rising and esteeming worthiness. Esteeming worthiness, the worthy are all willing to be accumulated by it. Occupying the superior position, it naturally has the power to accumulate them. With firmness, it can restrain strength, so it must nurture and perfect their worthiness before accumulating them—not hastily accumulating. Such is the great correctness of this line. Thus, all worthy of the time partake in the great feast. If even one person ate at home, it would be clear that the wilds had no unrecognized worthy. Together, they bear the thoroughfare of Heaven, respond to Heaven, and ford the great river—what doubt could there be?\n\nNow observe the First Nine, dwelling below, which could advance and be accumulated by the Top Nine. Yet it sees advancement as perilous and halts, avoiding the disaster of rash progress. Thus, the worthiness of the First is to be esteemed. The Nine in the Second has already harnessed its carriage, yet it sheds its shafts—this worthiness of the Second is to be esteemed, for its centeredness has no fault. The Nine in the Third originally aligns with the Top Nine’s will. Now, its carriage is harnessed, its fine horse gallops, and the three yang lines surge forward. Yet it still daily practices charioteering and defense, not forgetting the mind of hardship and correctness—this worthiness of the Third is to be esteemed. Naturally, it is \"beneficial to have somewhere to go.\" As for the Fourth and Fifth, below they ride the three yang lines, above they accumulate *Gen*’s firmness. This is called the \"young bull\" and the \"boar,\" while the single yang above resembles its castrated form and the restraint of its tusks. Thus, it preemptively restrains their strength and accumulates them to completion—supremely auspicious with joy, good fortune with celebration, which goes without saying.\n\nThe Third aligns in will. The Fourth has joy, and the Fifth has celebration—thus, the Top Nine’s path of accumulation reaches its great advancement. The way of all correctness opens the path for the many yang lines, clearing Heaven’s thoroughfare to smoothness. At this point, all flourish and aspire to be employed—who could surpass *Da Xu*? Yet observe the three yang lines: first, there is danger; then, the shedding of shafts; and the upholding of hardship and correctness. Observe the Fourth and Fifth: they are restrained by the castrated form and guarded by the tusks, preventing their strength from being hastily displayed or tested. Its accumulation is not taken lightly—such is the case. Truly, this is the time of *Da Xu*, akin to the era of Yao and Shun.\n\nSomeone asked: \"How do you know that 'brilliance daily renewing' refers specifically to *Gen*’s restraint?\" I replied: \"If it halted without advancing, how could it be 'daily renewing'? Thus, observing the Fourth and Fifth, one must restrain before advancing—this can be known.\"\n\n**Appendix.**\n\nSu Po’s explanation states: The *Xiao Xu*’s discourse on the wheel-spokes arises from necessity, hence husband and wife turn against each other. The *Da Xu*’s discourse on the shaft is willingly embraced, thus there is no blame within.\n\nCai Jiefu says: The shaft and the spokes differ. The spokes are the converging wheel-rims, thirty in total. The shaft is the crossbar beneath the carriage, bearing its weight. The *Xiao Xu* speaks of the spokes—where yin restrains them, the discourse concerns plans for prolonged stability. The *Da Xu* speaks of the shaft—where it halts of its own accord without advancing, the discourse is subtle: a temporary pause from which one may swiftly rise again.\n\nXiong Guo says: According to Zheng Xuan and Guanxia’s *Riyue Jueju*, Guan Shi states: \"At dawn it is brilliance; at midday it is light.\" As for the *tusks*, the *Kunya* says: \"That which substitutes for tethering a pig is called *ya*.\" The upper firm line lies ahead—like a substitute tusk. Lu Shinong says: The *ya* is what accumulates in place of a pig’s tether. Now, in the regions of Hai and Dai, striking a pig with a rack is called *ya*.\n\nJiao Ruohou says: \"Daily training in chariot and guard\" and \"daily\" in seal script are quite similar. What is the thoroughfare of Heaven? What is the cangue?\n\nWhat does *he* mean? Homophonous with *he* (賀), it signifies \"to bear\" or \"to carry.\" The *Fu on the Hall of Magnificent Light* states: \"Bearing Heaven’s thoroughfare, it attains primal flourishing.\" This demonstrates the interchangeability of ancient graphs. The *Zhou Book of Documents* commentary cites *Zhuangzi*’s \"bearing the azure sky without hindrance\" as further evidence. Xiang Ziqī said: \"Nothing halts like a mountain—nothing is greater than Heaven. Heaven resides within the mountain: this is the image of *Great Accumulation*.\"\n\nBelow *Zhen* (震), above *Gen* (艮): *Yi* (頤). \"Persistence brings good fortune. Observing nourishment, one seeks sustenance for oneself.\"\n\nThe *Tuan* says: \"*Yi*: persistence brings good fortune, for nourishing the correct brings good fortune. Observing nourishment is observing what one nurtures; seeking sustenance for oneself is observing how one nourishes oneself. Heaven and Earth nourish the myriad things; the sage nourishes the worthy and thereby the myriad people. How great is the timing of *Yi*!\"\n\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Thunder beneath the mountain: *Yi*. The noble person is thus cautious in speech and moderates eating and drinking.\"\n\n**First Nine:** \"Abandoning your numinous tortoise, you observe my chewing—misfortune.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Observing my chewing is likewise unworthy.\"\n\n**Six in the Second:** \"Overturning nourishment, defying the norm; seeking nourishment from the hill—advancing brings misfortune.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Advancing brings misfortune for Six in the Second, for one loses one’s kind.\"\n\n**Six in the Third:** \"Defying nourishment, persistence brings misfortune. For ten years, do not act—nothing is favorable.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"For ten years, do not act—such a path is greatly perverse.\"\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** \"Overturning nourishment—good fortune. The tiger’s gaze is fierce, its desires relentless—no blame.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Good fortune in overturning nourishment: bestowing radiance above.\"\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** \"Defying the norm, dwelling in persistence brings good fortune. One cannot ford the great river.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Good fortune in dwelling in persistence: compliance follows from above.\"\n\n**Top Nine:** \"Deriving nourishment—danger brings good fortune. Favorable to ford the great river.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Deriving nourishment—danger brings good fortune, for great felicity ensues.\"\n\n*Mountain-Thunder: Yi*\nWhy, in *Yi*, is it said that \"persistence brings good fortune\"? The so-called *yi* amounts to nothing more than seeking a single mouthful for oneself—what persistence or good fortune lies therein? Alas, *yi* is what nourishes others. To \"observe nourishment\" is to observe what one nurtures, not how one nourishes oneself. If one merely seeks sustenance for oneself, knowing only self-nourishment, what is there to observe? Thus, observing Heaven and Earth, one sees that what they nourish are the myriad things—Heaven and Earth do not nourish themselves. Observing the sage, one sees that what he nourishes are the worthy and thereby the myriad people—the sage does not nourish himself. How correct is this nourishing! Persistence therein brings good fortune. Hence it is said: \"How great is the timing of *Yi*!\"\n\nThe Top Nine nourishes the worthy. The Fifth, yielding and centered; the Fourth, yielding and correct—both rightly align with the worthy whom the Top Nine nourishes. Yet Six in the Fifth is the ruler. When the ruler ought to nourish others but is instead nourished by them, is this not contrary to the norm and defiant of principle? Though one may recognize the ruler’s inability to nourish and thus turn to the Top Nine for sustenance, one still cannot ford the great river. Yet dwelling in persistence brings good fortune, which must return to him—this is compliance following from above.\n\nThe Top Nine is the firmness of *Gen*; the First Nine is the firmness of *Zhen*. Both are yang firmness and thus both should nourish the worthy. Yet the firmness of *Zhen* lies below, desiring to nourish the worthy but unable to do so. If one remains envious of the Fourth’s nourishment above, then though one may daily embody yang firmness, how can one be deemed worthy? Beholding the Fourth’s nourishment from above, one is moved by observation—this is what is meant by \"abandoning the numinous tortoise to observe chewing,\" a base act indeed. *Duoyi* (朵颐) is the Fourth’s *yi*, an image of hanging downward.\n\nThe Second and the Fifth are proper correlates. If the Second seeks to respond to the Fifth’s hill, then the Fifth, awaiting nourishment from above, cannot but lose its kind and advance to misfortune. If it seeks to respond to the mountain’s summit above, this is not its proper correlate, defying the norm—how can one predict the outcome? As for Six in the Third, its proper correlate is above, and it should rightly receive nourishment from above. Yet it fails to recognize that the above nourishes the worthy and thereby the myriad people, instead harboring thoughts of defying nourishment and lofty aspirations—this is not impersistence. Yet why does it incur misfortune from losing its timing? Though it may remain unused for ten years, it merely withers in isolation, greatly perverse to the Way.\n\nWhat profit could there be in this? Only Six in the Fourth, dwelling within the same *Gen* body, merits the straightforward declaration of \"fortune in inverting the nourishment\" as a stroke of luck. For when Nine at the Top radiates its light, who would not submit? As King Wen excelled in nurturing, even Boyi and Taigong came to join him—how much more so for those of the same body? Or those in proper correlation? When nourishment is thus, even a tiger’s devouring brings satisfaction; what fault could others find, that one would turn to defying nourishment to assert one’s own loftiness? Does one not know that the above is the very source of the hexagram, the root of nourishment wherein the nurturing of Heaven and Earth and the sages resides? To nourish all under Heaven is to bear its cares—how could one not take this as a warning? Yet those who would nourish all under Heaven must first nourish the worthy. How, then, could this not be called the profit of \"crossing the river by means of nourishment\"? The celebration of *Dayou* is surely what the sage desires to behold—yet if the time is not ripe, what can be done? Even if one possesses a spirit-turtle, if others fail to value it, one cannot but value oneself. Alas, on what day, at what hour, will people cease their restless pursuit and instead regard one as a mighty tiger?\n\n**Appendix**\nLiu Junbo says: Above *Gen*, below *Zhen*—outer firmness, inner softness—forms the image of a turtle. The turtle can subsist without food, nourishing itself through *qi*.\n\nDeng Bogao says: *Duo* (朵), according to the *Benyi*, means \"to hang down.\" The *Shuowen* states: *Duo* refers to the hanging blossoms of a tree. The movement of the jaws causes them to hang down, revealing their activity.\n\nSu Shi explains: Above, stillness; below, movement—this is the image of nourishment. What all know yet find difficult to practice is to be cautious in speech and moderate in eating. Once words are spoken, they cannot be retracted; once food is consumed, it cannot be expelled.\n\nHexagram 59: *Daguo* (Great Exceeding), with *Xun* below and *Dui* above: The ridgepole sags. It is beneficial to have somewhere to go; there will be smooth progress.\n\n**The Image** says: *Daguo* means greatness in excess. The ridgepole sags—this is because the root and branches are weak. Though firmness exceeds, it remains centered; advancing with compliance and joy brings benefit to one’s journey, leading to smooth progress. How momentous is the time of *Daguo*!\n\n**The Image** says: The marsh submerges the wood—this is *Daguo*. The noble person stands alone without fear, encountering a world of deep gloom.\n\n- **First Six:** Using white couch grass as a mat incurs no blame.\n  **The Image** says: Using white couch grass as a mat—this is because softness lies below.\n\n- **Nine in the Second:** A withered poplar sprouts new shoots! An old man takes a young wife—nothing is advantageous.\n  **The Image** says: An old man with a young wife—excess in their union.\n\n- **Nine in the Third:** The ridgepole sags—misfortune.\n  **The Image** says: The misfortune of a sagging ridgepole—it cannot be supported.\n\n- **Nine in the Fourth:** The ridgepole is raised—good fortune. If there is another, there will be regret.\n  **The Image** says: The good fortune of a raised ridgepole—it does not sag beneath.\n\n- **Nine in the Fifth:** A withered poplar blooms; an old woman takes a young husband—no blame, no praise.\n  **The Image** says: A withered poplar blooms—how can this last? An old woman with a young husband—this is also shameful.\n\n- **Top Six:** Crossing the water, one is submerged past the crown—misfortune, yet no blame.\n  **The Image** says: The misfortune of crossing the water—it cannot be blamed.\n\nThe time of *Daguo* demands a foundation and branches both firm and strong, a body purely *Qian*-like in vigor, only then can there be great smooth progress without blame. Yet if it were purely *Qian*, it could not be called \"greatness in excess.\" It is only because the top and bottom lines are yin—soft and weak—that excess arises.\n\nWhat constitutes excess? A lord exceeding his ministers, a father exceeding his son, a husband exceeding his wife. If a lord exceeds his ministers, who will serve as his limbs? If a father exceeds his son, who will carry on his legacy? If a husband exceeds his wife, who will manage the inner domain? If yang exceeds yin, who will complete the cycle? This is precisely the time of *Daguo*—it cannot be delayed. One must swiftly go forth to seek firmness and uprightness, only then can there be smooth progress and the sagging ridgepole be avoided. Thus it is said: How momentous is the time of *Daguo*! This means that in such a time, one cannot follow the usual path; one must act with greatness beyond others—doing what others dare not. Like setting aside the Four Mountains to promote the obscure, or passing over the eminent to summon the humble from the cliffs of Fu Rock, the sages of old were largely like this. In this hexagram, only the Nine in the Fourth is sufficient to meet this moment. As Nine occupies the fourth place, firmness exceeds yet remains centered; with *Xun* containing *Dui*, it advances with compliance and joy. Thus it can benefit from having somewhere to go and achieve smooth progress, bringing the good fortune of a raised ridgepole.\n\nSuppose it were said: \"It responds to the First Six\"—this would be mistaken. The Nine in the Fourth, embodying compliance and joy, firmness and centered vigor, is not something the lowly First Six can sway. Now that it has achieved the good fortune of a raised ridgepole, there may be times when it relies on the First Six, using couch grass as a mat—what blame could there be? But if, having attained the smooth progress of a raised ridgepole, it merely waits for another’s response, it would be like trying to support the peak of a great hall with a single blade of grass—impossible. How could the Fourth incur such regret?\n\nThe Nine in the Third also possesses the timber of a ridgepole, but as Nine occupies the third place, firmness exceeds without centering. At the top of *Xun*, it knows only compliance and cannot advance with joy. Unable to go forth and achieve smooth progress, what can be said of the misfortune of a sagging ridgepole? When the ridgepole is raised in good fortune, even the white couch grass of the First Six—though not *Xun* wood—can be used without blame. But when the ridgepole sags in misfortune, even wood submerged past its crown, the toil of crossing the water, cannot support it to success. This is why the time of *Daguo* demands talent that is itself *Daguo*!\n\nThe Top Six is precisely the image of the marsh submerging the wood—submerged so deeply that the crown is not seen. At the extreme of *Dui*, the marsh waters run deep; crossing the water, one is submerged past the crown, and the wood is equally submerged—what misfortune! Yet the marsh can submerge the wood but cannot make the wood sink; when the waters recede, the wood emerges—what blame does the wood truly bear? Thus, the First Six’s weakness lies in its position below *Xun*, so its regret is with the wood, not the marsh. The Top Six’s weakness lies in its position above *Dui*, so its regret is with the marsh, not the wood.\n\nThe Second and Fifth also possess the timber of ridgepoles. Now, west of the Taihang Mountains, every household plants poplars—not only for their rapid growth but also for their straightness and strength, suitable for beams and ridgepoles. Yet if they wither past their time, they become useless. What is fortunate is that the withered may sprout new shoots. The reason they sprout new shoots is their connection below to the First Six, gaining a young wife. Though the First Six sees the Second as an old man, though past their time, their union allows the Second to sprout new shoots, becoming beams and ridgepoles—nothing is disadvantageous. Unlike the Fifth’s connection to the Top Six, where a young husband gains an old wife. Fleeting blossoms cannot last, nor do they sprout new shoots—what use are they? The Fifth’s end as a withered poplar is truly deluded.\n\nFang Shihua says: The ridgepole is likened to *Xun*, to wood. The four yang lines stand in parallel; the third and fourth, occupying the center, are like the ridgepole of a house. The withered poplar is wood past its time; the Second and Fourth share the same function, so the withered poplar sprouts new shoots, aiding the Fourth. The Third and Fifth differ in position, so the withered poplar only blooms, offering no support to the Third. The First Six originally symbolizes white couch grass, and with yin below yang, it also symbolizes the pairing of an old man with a young wife. The Top Six originally symbolizes submersion past the crown, and with yin above yang, it also symbolizes the pairing of an old woman with a young husband.\n\n**Appendix**\n\nYang Yuansu says: \"Not bound by conventional righteousness\" means one must not be constrained by ordinary morality. \"Not for everyday use\" signifies that the extraordinary can be employed. At the moment of exercising discretion, the pivot of success or failure—can this not be called great?\n\nXiong Guo says: As stated in *Essential Techniques for the Common People*, the white poplar is suitable for house construction. Lü Zhongmu says: A lord in distress who obtains a minister capable of restoring order—is this not like fish and water? A father who establishes a household who meets a son capable of sustaining it—does not their bond reach the spirits? This is the withered poplar sprouting new shoots.\n\nWang Ji says: Marshes can drown wood yet cannot fell it—it stands fearless. They can submerge wood yet cannot destroy it—it endures through the ages without distress. This is what is meant by the conduct of one who surpasses others.\n\n**Hexagram 29: Kan (The Abysmal)**\n*Repeating peril. Possessing sincerity, only the heart is free; in action, there is esteem.*\n\n**The Judgment** says: *Repeating peril*—layered danger. Water flows yet does not overflow; traversing peril yet not losing its trustworthiness. Only the heart is free, for it is firm and centered. In action, there is esteem, for going forth brings achievement. Heaven’s peril cannot be scaled. Earth’s peril consists of mountains, rivers, hills, and mounds. Kings and lords establish peril to guard their states. The timely use of peril is truly great!\n\n**The Image** says: Water flows ceaselessly—*Repeating peril*. The noble one thereby constantly cultivates virtue and practices the affairs of teaching.\n\n**Line 1 (Initial Six):** Repeating peril, entering the pit’s depths—misfortune.\n**The Image** says: Repeating peril, entering the pit—losing the Way brings misfortune.\n\n**Line 2 (Nine in the Second):** Peril lies within; seek small gains.\n**The Image** says: Seeking small gains—yet to emerge from the center.\n\n**Line 3 (Six in the Third):** Coming and going, peril upon peril—danger and rest, entering the pit’s depths. Do not act.\n**The Image** says: Coming and going, peril upon peril—ultimately no achievement.\n\n**Line 4 (Six in the Fourth):** A jar of wine, a basket of food, earthen vessels—offerings modestly presented through the window. In the end, no blame.\n**The Image** says: A jar of wine, a basket of food—where firm and yielding meet.\n\n**Line 5 (Nine in the Fifth):** The peril is not full; it has just leveled. No blame.\n**The Image** says: The peril is not full—the center is not yet great.\n\n**Line 6 (Top Six):** Bound with ropes and fetters, placed among thorns—three years without release. Misfortune.\n**The Image** says: The Top Six loses the Way—misfortune for three years.\n\nKan is water. The sage establishes peril to secure the foundation, loving the state so that the Way naturally opens and the self is at peace. Thus, the sage constantly fears that peril is not layered enough, yet through *Repeating peril*, freedom is attained. The worthy enter peril for the sake of the state, yet their intent is not to love peril—yet in the end, they bring calamity to the state and misfortune to their families. Thus, peril overflows like a flood, beyond salvation, and *Repeating peril* begins in danger. One relies on peril for security; another emerges from peril yet cannot—here the distinction between sage and worthy, the divergence of their teachings, can be observed.\n\n**The Judgment** speaks of *Repeating peril* possessing sincerity, only the heart being free, and action being esteemed. The sage takes the world’s perils as his own defense. Viewing peril thus, he only fears that peril is not layered enough—what peril could he not emerge from? What peril could he not enter? But let this not be discussed further.\n\nWhat is most regrettable is that all great worthies, in times of peace, do not treat the cultivation of learning as urgent, and when matters arise, they cling to the norms of reputation to sustain themselves. Once they have entered peril, only then do they seek a way out—by then, it is too late.\n\nThus, it is shown: The noble person does not detest peril but detests entering peril of his own accord. If one does not enter peril, what peril can assail him? Now, if one enters peril due to one’s own missteps, then one is already within peril—how can one hastily emerge? Therefore, the noble person does not rejoice in his ability to emerge from peril but rather rejoices in his ability to cautiously enter peril. Why? Because when faced with such unavoidable circumstances, there must first be a situation that can be managed, and only then can one calmly plan. This is like King Wen’s imprisonment in Youli.\n\nThus, once one has entered peril, one must settle into it without haste, without rushing to escape. One should treat peril as a pillow and delve into the depths of its abyss—this is the foremost principle in handling peril. It is not that one does not desire to emerge, but at such a time, to seek escape would ultimately be futile. If one pursues minor gains without realizing that the layered perils cannot be swiftly overcome, then one may fear that the abyss will become perilous, and in the end, one may never emerge again.\n\nOnly the sixth line of the third position truly grasps the Dao of dwelling in peril, and King Wen again raises it as a warning—its meaning is profound. The initial line represents one who enters the abyss of his own accord. Once one has entered the abyss, one is already enriched—who can one blame? This is like Chen Shu and Ouyang Xun. The top line represents one who has fortunately emerged from peril, yet is still bound by restraints, placed among thorns, and remains subject to three years of misfortune—can this be allowed to continue? This is like Li Gu and Chen Fan. These are all figures the world calls great worthies, yet in the end, they could not protect themselves, brought calamity to the state, and still prided themselves on their reputations for integrity—how tragic!\n\nAs for the *zun* wine and the *fu* vessel, this is like Shuzi of Wei. Before the abyss is filled, it is like Duke Cheng of Wei. The second line of the nine seeks only minor gains, so it has not yet emerged from the center. Now, the fifth line of the nine faces peril ahead, meaning the abyss is not yet full. If one points to the day of emerging from the abyss, it is as if the abyss has already been leveled. Though still within the abyss, the center is not greatly flawed. The second line of the nine seeks the companionship of minor gains, which is why it can emerge together with the fourth, ultimately without blame.\n\nThe *Commentary* states: Water flows without filling, traverses peril without losing its sincerity—this is the image of possessing sincerity. The second and fifth lines are centered and firm, with only the heart being free—this is the image. One abyss follows another, two abysses layered together, advancing without end—this is the image of esteemed action and meritorious achievement. Thus, the abyss truly bestows merit and power upon people, and its great utility in due time is evident. Therefore, the *Judgment* and *Commentary* uniquely emphasize the peril of the abyss, inverting it to esteem the abyss—this is fitting.\n\n*\"Pillow\"* refers to resting upon the second line.\n\n**Appendix**\nJin Rubai said: Among the eight trigrams, only *Kan* is the hexagram of hardship and adversity. Confucius once remarked: *\"Was the author of the Changes not one who knew hardship?\"* Thus, he arranged the nine hexagrams to clarify the Dao of handling them. Both yang lines are firm and centered, yet the second is not equal to the fifth. The fifth is centered, upright, and about to emerge from peril.\n\nXiong Nansha said: *\"Fu\"* (enriched), according to Wang Su, refers to the bottom of the abyss, beneath the *Repeating Peril*. The *Shuowen* states: *\"Within the abyss, there is yet another abyss.\"* *Repeating Peril* refers to the combination of the inner and outer trigrams. *\"Entering the abyss\"* refers to the inner trigram’s interior, meaning arrival. *\"Coming and going\"* refers to the abyss within the abyss. The lower abyss has just been escaped, while the upper abyss lies ahead.\n\n*\"Wine\"* is the dark water of the abyss. *\"Fu\"* (vessel), according to the *Erya*, is a type of jar. Sun Yan said: The earthenware vessel is also an image of *Li* (fire), like a drum or jar, which can accompany singing, hence the *Book of Songs* says: *\"Kan! They strike the jars.\"*\n\nThe fourth line is even and empty, allowing light to pass through—this is the image of a window. The fourth and fifth lines intertwine, not through the door but through the window, as they are not in proper correspondence. Among the six children, the lines of the doubled hexagrams do not correspond; their meaning lies in close proximity alone. The fourth line of *Kan* is yielding, closely aligned with the fifth’s firmness—hence it is said: *\"Firm and yielding meet.\"*\n\n*\"Zhi\"* (only), according to Zheng, is written as *\"zhi\"* (paper). According to the *Book of Songs*: *\"Wan is in the water like paper.\"* The *Shuowen* states: *\"A small islet, not yet fully formed.\"* This explains *\"the abyss is not full\"* in three instances.\n\n*\"Hui\"* refers to the thighs; *\"jin\"* refers to both thighs. *Kan* represents thorns. *\"Placed among thorns\"* means deliberating under the nine thorns. The *Nine Schools of the Changes* states: *\"Those who harm others are subjected to severe punishment.\"* For those who can reform, the gravest offense is punished with three years of confinement, followed by three years of probation. Those who cannot reform and leave the prison grounds are executed—hence the misfortune.\n\nSu Shi explained: *\"Zun* wine and *fu* vessel\"* are meager offerings. *\"Entering through the window\"* is the height of simplicity. Those who share interests become close without formal bonds; those who share hardships trust without prior agreement. The fourth line is not the fifth’s master, nor is the fifth the fourth’s shield. Though they exchange meager gifts and act with simplicity, they ultimately do not blame each other—this is the relationship between the fourth and fifth lines.\n\nLi Zisi said: The top line rides below five firm lines, foreshadowing the calamity of being bound and placed among thorns—like a man trapped in prison, hands entangled in ropes, feet treading upon thorns.\n\nSima Junshi said: Water flows continuously, accumulating to form great rivers. A person’s learning, when practiced without cease, leads to great worthiness. Thus, the noble person constantly cultivates virtue and practices teaching.\n\n---\n**Hexagram 30: Li (Clinging)**\n*Li*: Favorable for constancy, offering. Nurturing a cow brings good fortune.\n\n**The Image** states: *Li* means clinging. The sun and moon cling to the heavens; the hundred grains, grasses, and trees cling to the earth. Layered brightness clinging to uprightness transforms and completes the world. Yielding clings to the center and uprightness, hence offering. Therefore, nurturing a cow brings good fortune.\n\n**The Image** states: Brightness doubled forms *Li*. The great person, with unceasing brightness, illuminates the four directions.\n\n**Line 1 (Nine at the Bottom):**\nTreading with caution, reverence brings no blame.\n*The Image* states: Reverence in treading with caution averts blame.\n\n**Line 2 (Six in the Second Place):**\nYellow clinging—supreme good fortune.\n*The Image* states: Yellow clinging, supreme good fortune, attains the central Dao.\n\n**Line 3 (Nine in the Third Place):**\nThe sun’s clinging in decline—if one does not drum the jar and sing, there will be the lament of great old age. Ominous.\n*The Image* states: The sun’s clinging in decline—how can this last long?\n\n**Line 4 (Nine in the Fourth Place):**\nBursting forth as if ablaze, perishing as if dead, discarded as if cast away.\n*The Image* states: Bursting forth as if ablaze—there is no place to contain it.\n\n**Line 5 (Six in the Fifth Place):**\nTears flowing in streams, sorrowful sighs—good fortune.\n*The Image* states: The good fortune of the six in the fifth place clings to the king and duke.\n\n**Line 6 (Nine at the Top):**\nThe king employs military force, achieving merit by beheading leaders, capturing those not of his kind—no blame.\n*The Image* states: The king employs military force to rectify the state.\n\n*Li* is fire.\nAt the time of transformation, *Fang* says: *Li* means clinging. Clinging and then brightness—sun and moon cling to the heavens; the hundred grains, grasses, and trees cling to the earth. This illustrates layered brightness clinging to uprightness. How does *Li* benefit from constancy? The hexagram’s refined and luminous yielding clings to the central and upright positions of the second and fifth lines. At this time, the hidden is fully revealed, the myriad beings are each rectified, and all find peace in the constant rhythms of labor and rest, plowing and eating, digging and drinking. What more is there to do? Only nurturing a cow brings good fortune.\n\nThe inner trigram’s three lines form the lower *Li*. The first is the dawn of the sun; the second, the sun at midday.\n\nThree marks the reversal into the years of decrepitude, when the funeral procession draws near.\n\nFor a person, the plan for a single day lies in the morning. Opening the door and stepping forth, each attends to their duties—this is the image of treading with caution. The second line attains the central Way, its brilliance becoming yellow. \"Yellow brilliance, supreme fortune\"—this is the great illumination at its celestial hour. Beyond this lies the reversal of the third, which cannot endure long. If one does not strike the earthen jar and sing, then the lament of extreme old age arrives, and ominous signs follow. Rejoice in the moment while still able, and do not forget that death approaches. Not that death itself is evil, but rather that one should cherish these twilight years and delight in one’s own joy.\n\nThe outer trigram’s three lines form the upper *Li*. The fourth, fifth, and top lines combine to extend the illumination. The fourth line, *yang* at its peak, is like the sun atop the ridge—its paired shadows dissolve, speaking of swift dissolution, of sudden eruption, of burning and perishing, of abandonment and forsaking. Yet it was never a matter of rejection from the origin; thus the fifth line says \"as if.\" Should misfortune befall the people—like the lords of Youmiao or Gebo—who suffer harm, their grievances flow as tears to the great state. How could a benevolent ruler not sigh in sorrow? And if one eagerly seeks to rescue them, then the top line’s army marches forth, achieving meritorious triumph: annihilating the ringleaders and breaking their heads, capturing the living and presenting prisoners—all because they were not of our kind, and there was no other choice.\n\nSuch are the ministers and sovereign of layered brilliance; such is the work of great illumination. \"Nurturing a cow brings good fortune\"—truly no empty saying.\n\n*Appendix: Conclusion of the Third Scroll of the Upper Canon of the Yi Yin.*\n\n*Annotations in the original text are preserved as editorial markers in the translation.*\n\n---\n\n#1 Originally \"夫曰,\" but according to the context, it should read \"夫子曰.\" #2 \"强\" was originally written as \"张,\" emended according to the Jigu Ge edition. #3 The hexagram image was originally missing; supplied according to the context. #4 The hexagram image was originally missing; supplied according to the context. #5 \"白\" was originally written as \"日,\" emended according to the Jigu Ge edition. #6 The hexagram image was originally missing; supplied according to the context. #7 \"自\" was originally written as \"白,\" emended according to the *Zhouyi Benyi*. #8 \"才\" appears as \"未\" in the Jigu Ge edition. #8 According to the Jigu Ge edition, a \"危\" character is missing after \"人\"; now corrected. #10 The hexagram image was originally blank; emended according to the context. #11 \"于\" was originally written as \"干,\" emended according to the standard *Zhouyi*. #12 According to the Jigu Ge edition, a \"涕\" character is missing after \"出\"; now corrected.\n\n*Appendix to the Yi Yin*\n*Lower Canon*\n*Hexagrams: Xian (咸), Heng (恒), Dun (遁), and Dazhuang (大壮)*\n\n**Hexagrams of the Lower Canon (Continued):**\n*Mingyi* (明夷), *Jiaren* (家人), *Kui* (睽), *Jian* (蹇), *Jie* (解), *Sun* (损), *Yi* (益), *Guai* (夬), *Gou* (姤), *Cui* (萃), *Sheng* (升), *Kun* (困), *Jing* (井), *Ge* (革), *Ding* (鼎), *Zhen* (震), *Gen* (艮), *Jian* (渐), *Guimei* (归妹), *Feng* (丰), *Lü* (旅), *Xun* (巽), *Dui* (兑), *Huan* (涣), *Jie* (节), *Zhongfu* (中孚), *Xiaoguo* (小过), *Jiji* (既济), *Weiji* (未济).\n\n*Yiyin Lower Canon, Volume One*\n**Hexagram Xian (咸):**\n*Xian*: Smooth progress. Beneficial for constancy. Taking a wife brings good fortune.\n\n**The Judgment (彖):**\n*Xian* means \"responsive.\" The yielding is above and the firm below; the two *qi* respond to one another and interact. Stillness and joy, the man submits to the woman—thus there is smooth progress, benefit in constancy, and good fortune in taking a wife.\nHeaven and Earth respond, and the myriad things transform and arise; the sage responds to the human heart, and the world attains peace. Observe their responsiveness, and the nature of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things becomes visible.\n\n**The Image (象):**\nAbove the mountain is the marsh: the image of *Xian*. The noble person empties himself to receive others.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Six:** Responds with the big toe.\n**The Image:** Responds with the big toe—his aspiration lies outward.\n\n**Six in the Second:** Responds with the calf. Misfortune. Dwelling brings good fortune.\n**The Image:** Though misfortune, dwelling brings good fortune—submission avoids harm.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** Responds with the thigh, clinging to what follows. Going leads to regret.\n**The Image:** Responds with the thigh—he does not remain still. His aspiration is to follow others; what he clings to is lowly.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Constancy brings good fortune; regret vanishes. Coming and going in agitation, friends follow your thoughts.\n**The Image:** Constancy brings good fortune; regret vanishes—no harm from responsiveness. Coming and going in agitation—its brilliance is not yet great.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** Responds with the flesh of the upper arm. Supreme regret.\n**The Image:** Responds with the flesh of the upper arm—his aspiration is not yet realized.\n\n**Top Six:** Responds with the jaws, cheeks, and tongue.\n**The Image:** Responds with the jaws, cheeks, and tongue—flattery flows from the mouth.\n\n**Marsh above Mountain: Xian**\nThe Way of the world lies in responsiveness alone. The initial line, at the bottom of the inner trigram, aspires to the fourth line of the outer trigram—when there is response, the big toe moves. Above the toe is the calf, and above the calf is the thigh; when the toe moves, the calf and thigh follow. Thus, the initial line responds and moves, the second line follows its movement, and the third line follows as well. The second line corresponds to the position of the calf, and the third to the position of the thigh. Above the thigh lies the heart, and the fourth line occupies the heart’s position—though the heart is unseen, it appears unmoved. Yet constancy may bring good fortune and dispel regret. Responsiveness is the constant principle of the world, and regret or harm often lies within it. The noble person, moved by response, considers regret but never abandons responsiveness because of it.\n\nNow, if the initial line responds to the fourth, yet the fourth seems unresponsive, why is this? Before response, there is no movement; without movement, there is the good fortune of steadfast constancy. Without response, there is no harm; without harm, supreme regret may vanish—is this not excellent? Yet the line anxiously probes your thoughts, and *The Image* further judges it as \"not yet great\"—this is because unresponsiveness is unnatural. The heart must be disturbed by coming and going; how can it not be bright and upright? Such is the mockery it invites.\n\nAbove the heart lies the diaphragm, and the fifth line occupies the position of the upper arm’s flesh. When there is response, the upper arm moves, though its movement is not readily visible. Above the upper arm lies the jaw, and the top line occupies the jaw’s position. Thus, observing the jaw’s movement reveals the fifth line’s aspiration toward the top. Otherwise, why would the top line expend such flattery? Alas! Responsiveness is the true principle—what need is there for words? Responsiveness is the true heart—how can it remain unmoved? Heaven and Earth are thus, and the myriad things are thus; otherwise, all movement in the world would nearly cease.\n\nThe initial line’s movement of the toe is responsiveness. The second line’s movement of the calf is not responsiveness but following—it moves in tandem with the initial line, which King Wen found blameworthy. Confucius said: Though the second line seems to follow the initial line’s movement, how can one be certain it does not respond to a response? Following the initial line leads to misfortune, so dwelling brings good fortune. If there is true responsiveness, then submission avoids harm.\n\nOnly the third line truly follows the initial line’s movement, hence it is said, \"he does not remain still.\" When others move, he moves—not because of a prior response. To respond and not move is wrong; this is the principle. Movement from response is free of calculation, while movement from following is mere servitude. Thus it is said, \"what he clings to is lowly\"—like a servant obeying commands, not the conduct of a true person. Alas! If following is not responsiveness, then the world’s responsiveness is abandoned. Movement not arising from oneself—how can this be the true nature of responsive movement? Thus the sage values responsiveness over following, for response arises from oneself, while following is initiated by others. The distinction between self and other—can the scholar fail to examine this?\n\nIf there is response without reciprocation, then the world’s responsiveness is hollow. Spiritual response and spiritual reciprocation are the utmost in natural swiftness. Thus the sage speaks of response but not reciprocation, for response here is reciprocation there—they are one mechanism. Can the scholar fail to examine this? Only when response and reciprocation are one mechanism do they occur simultaneously—what need is there for anxious thoughts to deceive others?\n\nThe Old Bald One says: Above is *Dui* (☱), below is *Gen* (☶)—the yielding is above, the firm below. Mountain and marsh share *qi*, and the two *qi* respond and interact. Stillness and joy—this is the constancy of virtue. The man submits to the woman—this is the correctness of ritual. The Way of responsiveness is complete.\n\nHe also says: Response lies in the heart, and reciprocation also lies in the heart. When the heart responds, below it moves the feet, and above it moves the mouth.\n\nWhen first there is a stirring in the heart, the toes move—yet if the center of the four (the heart) does not respond, this is no true emotion. Thus the sage cuts off all anxious thoughts. The fifth line resides above the heart, its symbol being *hui* (悔, regret); when the fifth is stirred, it moves the spleen, yet the spleen, like the heart, cannot be seen. If the spleen moves, the mouth must respond—thus the primal *hui* (元悔, primal regret) becomes visible only when the cheeks assist. For when the spleen is stirred, the cheeks must respond; when the spleen moves, the mouth’s speech must follow the knees. Though *hui* and *yuanhui* may not yet be known, how can the truth of response and reciprocation be concealed?\n\nThe essential teaching of the *Xian* hexagram (☶☱) is drawn from the human body. Not only does response reside in the heart, but the upper line corresponds to the mouth of *Dui* (☱), while the lower line corresponds to the fingers of *Gen* (☶). When the heart is stirred, the toes move at once—even though this occurs in the line of *Gen* (☶), which signifies stillness, one cannot force them to stop. To insist on their immobility is nothing but deceit.\n\nAlas! Who knows that the transformation and generation of the myriad things, the peace of all under heaven, are all brought about by this response and reciprocation? Heaven and earth, even the sages, cannot stand apart from it—yet man seeks to adorn his emotions to deceive others. Thus I return once more to the *Xian* hexagram’s principle of response, and so I reiterate it.\n\nAlas! This is the foremost principle of inquiry and learning. Why so? To deceive oneself fundamentally is to render one’s intent sincere. When intent is sincere, the heart naturally attains correctness without effort, and the body naturally attains cultivation without contrivance—how then could family, state, and all under heaven fail to be ordered, governed, and pacified?\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Changgong says: The male submits to the female, submitting only to obtain—this is necessarily the upright. To take and obtain uprightness is the advantage of the taker. Passion is its truthfulness. The thundercloud follows the dragon, the wind follows the tiger—without cause, how could they follow one another? How could there be falsity?\n\nZhu Zhonghui says: *Xian* (咸) means response. When *Gen* (艮) halts, the response is concentrated in *Dui* (兑); when *Dui* delights, the response is complete. Moreover, *Gen* as the youngest son submits to *Dui* as the youngest daughter, the male preceding the female, thus attaining the correctness of male and female.\n\nYang Jian says: Having responded to one another in delight, why then speak of halting? Is halting not also delight? Delight divided becomes two; halting and delight united become one. Like the myriad images in still water, the water remains constant while the images move of themselves. Like heaven and earth responding to one another, they are never not serene. Great indeed is the Dao of halting and delight!\n\nMu Bolai says: *Xian* means response. Without response, how could there be *Xian*? The Dao of response is not only so for male and female. The Dao of heaven and earth acts above and moves below, and the myriad things flourish, transform, and come to life. The heart of the sage is sincere in this and moves in that, and all under heaven responds grandly, harmonious and at peace. Thus, observing their response, the nature of heaven, earth, and the myriad things becomes visible. Passion is the true mechanism of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. Without response, how could it be perceived?\n\n**Excerpts from *Xiangzhi* (象指), by Hu Shenyu**\nThe *Upper Canon* begins with *Qian* (乾) and *Kun* (坤) because heaven and earth are established in their positions. The *Lower Canon* begins with *Xian* (咸) and *Heng* (恒) because mountain and marsh communicate in qi. Position requires distinction, so heaven and earth are divided into two hexagrams. Qi requires union, so mountain and marsh are combined into one hexagram. In the eight pure hexagrams, none of the lines respond, but in *Tai* (泰) and *Pi* (否), heaven and earth respond; in *Jian* (成) and *Sun* (损), the youngest son and daughter respond; in *Heng* (恒) and *Yi* (益), the eldest son and daughter respond. In *Xian*, the youngest son submits to the youngest daughter, making it the most complete response—thus it heads the *Lower Canon*. It is also said: The *Shuowen* states, “The spleen is the backbone; the heart is connected to the backbone to stabilize spirit and govern the myriad affairs.” Hence the *Book of Songs* says, “The backbone’s strength manages affairs.” Wang Bi took it as the heart above and the mouth below, while Minister Lu identified it as the throat’s uvula. Feng He said it is the throat’s passage for intake and release.\n\nWang Ji says: Mountain and marsh communicate in qi, the mountain’s emptiness paired with the marsh’s moisture. Only emptiness enables communication; fullness obstructs it. Thus it is said: “They are hollowed in mountains and rivers.” The noble person, observing the image of mountain and marsh communicating in qi, empties the center to receive others. Emptiness is the source of the Dao. The eye is only empty, thus it can receive all colors under heaven. The ear is only empty, thus it can receive all sounds under heaven. The heart is only empty, thus it can receive all goodness under heaven. If the eye retains blue and yellow, its clarity is dazzled and cannot distinguish colors. If the ear retains purity and turbidity, its hearing is impaired and cannot discern sounds. If the heart retains essential principles, it becomes obstructed and cannot adapt to change. The noble person’s learning establishes the root through attaining emptiness. *Xian* is the response of the original heart. “Emptiness within, without self” is called uprightness; uprightness brings good fortune and eliminates regret. The response of the original heart—what is meant by “no thought, no worry”? “No thought, no worry” is not the absence of thought and worry. The heart moves directly, arising naturally. Though one thinks and worries all day, there is never any actual thought or worry. Thus it is said: “All under heaven converge in one destination by different paths, unite in one principle through a hundred considerations.” Scholars of the world cling to paths without knowing their destination, drown in considerations without knowing their principle—this is the response of restless agitation, not the natural Dao.\n\n☴☳ *Heng*: Persistence. Smooth progress, no blame, beneficial for uprightness, beneficial for having somewhere to go.\n**The *Tuan* says:** *Heng*? Endurance. The firm ascends and the yielding descends; thunder and wind unite, yielding and moving, firm and yielding all responding—this is *Heng*. “Smooth progress, no blame, beneficial for uprightness”—enduring in one’s Dao. The Dao of heaven and earth endures without ceasing. “Beneficial for having somewhere to go”—ending then beginning anew. The sun and moon attain heaven and thus can shine long; the four seasons transform and thus can endure in their completion. The sage endures in the Dao, and all under heaven is transformed and completed. Observing their endurance, the nature of heaven, earth, and the myriad things becomes visible.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Thunder and wind: *Heng*. The noble person stands firm and does not change his principles.\n**First Six:** Dredging persistence—uprightness brings misfortune; no benefit in anything.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The misfortune of dredging persistence lies in seeking depth from the outset.\n**Nine Two:** Regret vanishes.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Nine Two’s regret vanishes because it can endure in the center.\n**Nine Three:** Not persistent in virtue—someone may bring shame upon it; uprightness brings remorse.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Not persistent in virtue—there is no place for it.\n**Nine Four:** Hunting in the field yields no game.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Enduring where it is not one’s position—how can one obtain game?\n**Six Five:** Persistent in virtue—uprightness. For a woman, good fortune; for a man, misfortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** A woman’s uprightness brings good fortune because she follows one to the end. A man’s judgment of righteousness—following a woman brings misfortune.\n**Top Six:** Shaking persistence—misfortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Shaking persistence in the highest position achieves nothing great.\n\n**Thunder and Wind: *Heng***\nFang Shihua says: *Zhi* (值) means duration. Since it is called duration, persistence lies within me—naturally, there is no need for forced seeking. The first line corresponds to the beginning of *Xun*’s (☴) entry—now is when one begins to seek. Without seeking, seeking itself is unbeneficial.\n\n**On *Heng*:**\n*Heng* means persistence. Since it is called *heng*, persistence resides within—naturally, its depth is not perceived. The first line corresponds to the moment of *Xun*’s (☴) entry, when one begins to seek deeper penetration. Without depth, depth itself invites misfortune. Only the second line, *Nine Two*, avoids this. Dwelling in the center, it is fundamentally deep; firm yet without forced seeking, thus its regret vanishes. *Nine Three* is overly firm and not centered; moreover, *Xun* inclines toward advancement, leading ultimately to restlessness. The third line of the hexagram resides in *Xun*—its lack of constancy in virtue is evident. If one still feels shame at this, it may yet be remedied; but the restless, self-satisfied person, should others defer to their disgrace, would find no place among companions or peers.\n\n*Nine Four* dwells at the base of the upper trigram, neither centered nor correct, its *Zhen* (☳) movement already excessive. This stems from delusional expectations of gain, unaware that hunting yields no game—ignorant that no gain is itself a gain. Thus, the Master reverses this, saying: Even in pursuing game, there is a proper way. If one, lacking central position, seeks recklessly, what use is persistence? *Zhen* symbolizes the great path and the field; *Xun* symbolizes the fowl. *Six Five*, a yin line in a yang position, merely embodies constancy in virtue—yet this still invites misfortune for the man. For it knows *heng* but not the source of *heng*.\n\n*\n\nThe *Xiang* says: The peril of being bound in retreat stems from exhaustion and weariness. That keeping servants and concubines brings good fortune means no great undertakings are possible.\n\n*Nine Four*: A fondness for retreat—good fortune for the noble person, misfortune for the petty person.\nThe *Xiang* says: The noble person’s fondness for retreat means the petty person fares ill.\n\n*Nine Five*: An admirable retreat—constancy brings good fortune.\nThe *Xiang* says: An admirable retreat with constancy brings good fortune, for the will is rightly aligned.\n\n*Top Nine*: A rich retreat—nothing is not favorable.\nThe *Xiang* says: A rich retreat—nothing is not favorable, for there is no cause for doubt.\n\nThe hexagram *Tian Shan Dun* (Retreat) represents a time when the two yin lines gradually lengthen while the four yang lines withdraw their *qi*. Because this is a time of withdrawing *qi*, it is called \"return\"; because one can act in accord with the times, it is said that \"retreat is *heng* (smooth/flourishing).\" In this hexagram, *Nine Five* holds its proper position, while *Six Two*, a yin line in gradual ascent, responds to it. If one fails to recognize this as a time of withdrawing *qi* and that as a time of gradual yin growth, knowing only to maintain the old correspondence and move in step with the times, can this not still be called \"retreat that is *heng*\"? Not pursuing is precisely what makes for a good retreat. Otherwise, how could it be *heng*, how could it be great, how could it benefit the significance of the times and the act of retreat?\n\nThus, the noble person retreats from the world all day long, never for a single moment failing to retreat. Originally, this is not because one waits for petty persons to grow gradually before considering a return to seek *heng*. Would one die only when the time of gradual growth arrives? Hence it is said: \"The significance of retreat in its time is great indeed!\"\n\n*Initial Six* steps out the door and immediately associates with noble persons. If the noble person does not recognize this, he too will readily engage with them—this is failing to retreat at the very beginning. Only when, in the end, he sees their hearts are not of the same kind does he grow averse and retreat. Is this not too late? Can he avoid peril? Thus it is said: \"If one does not proceed, what disaster is there?\" This means that if one retreats at the outset and does not proceed, what peril could there be? As with Kou Zhun’s recommendation of Ding Wei and Zhang Jun, or Qin Hui and his two sons—once they seized power and gained the emperor’s favor, only then did others grow averse and retreat, only to be ensnared by them in the end. When Zhang Jun said to Emperor Gaozong, \"Only after dealing with him closely did I realize his darkness,\" the peril of retreating too late was most evident. In the hexagram, the top is the head, and the bottom is the tail, hence \"retreat at the tail.\"\n\n*Six Two* arrives precisely at the time of gradual yin growth, like Li Linfu of the Tang. When Linfu first saw Emperor Xuanzong trust Li Juezhi, he privately told Juezhi: \"Mount Hua is most auspicious, fitting for imperial tombs.\" Juezhi then reported this to Xuanzong. Delighted, Xuanzong immediately told Linfu, who feigned shock: \"Your servant did not know this, but Mount Hua is Your Majesty’s natal sign—how could it be lightly disturbed?\" Xuanzong then demoted Juezhi and revered Linfu, allowing Linfu to firmly secure the emperor’s favor. Qin Hui of the Song likewise used this tactic to strip the three great generals of their power and win Emperor Gaozong’s favor. This is what it means to personally seize someone in court, binding their hands and feet with the hide of a yellow ox so they cannot escape—yet those bound still do not understand. How pitiful! Why have they not studied the art of retreating from the world?\n\n*Three* is the master of *Gen* (☶, Keeping Still), sharing the same body. If one is bound and halted, the shared body falls ill, and peril must reach *Three*. However, *Two* and *Initial* are both long-standing servants and concubines: at home, *Three* is the master; in the state, *Three* is the superior. Though *Three* is bound, *Gen*’s firm yang resides above, naturally able to restrain the growing influence of its servants and concubines, allowing only minor matters and not great ones. What misfortune could there be? Since it is auspicious, what peril remains?\n\n*Nine Four* shares a fondness with *Initial*, turning back while still inclined toward it. The noble person’s good fortune needs no explanation. Since the noble person fares well, the petty person naturally fares ill and cannot burden the noble person. If one waits until the tail to retreat, how can one avoid sharing in their ill fate?\n\n*Five* recognizes that pursuit stems from fondness and thus alone admires retreat. This further reveals *Nine Five*’s will, which *Six Two* cannot firmly grasp. Hence, constancy brings good fortune. When the yang of right will honors what is admirable, the yin of firm will naturally has no means to sell its gradual growth. Thus, even if two yin lines daily encroach at *Nine Five*’s side, what harm is there? Yet only with a *Nine Five*-like ruler can one deeply admire a fond retreat. Such a ruler is rarely encountered in a thousand years, and the yang firmness of a thousand years will likewise be oppressed by the petty yin of small-minded persons.\n\nDi Renjie’s service under Empress Wu, or Feng Changle’s conduct during the Five Dynasties—hiding in the marketplace, acting amid peril and chaos, laboring with the turbid and emerging with the clear—each had their own way of wandering. Tao Hongjing refused to serve the Liang, Chen Tuan refused to serve the Song—this was resolute. Yet Li Bi, in commoner’s garb, met with Emperor Suzong at Lingwu; Liu Bingzhong, in monk’s robes, met with the emperor at Shangdu; and in our dynasty, Master Yao, from beyond the world, aided the Jingnan campaign. Even his elder sister, a former acquaintance, refused to see him, saying, \"This is the monk who kills people\"—yet Master Yao had no doubt in his actions. Is this not also a sorrowful wandering? Alas! Only thus can one cross safely, with nothing not favorable.\n\nWho but the \"Nine at the Top\" of Qian could bear this? Liu Yongxiang said: \"The mountain stands beneath heaven, still and unmoved—what flight could there be? To halt yet wander is to halt in excess. With feeling yet without feeling—how distant it is! Following the high, descending to the low, adapting to the world’s ways—how could one not detest it? Unshaken by disturbance, unshaken by quaking—how stern it is! Thus do petty men regard the noble: as if the noble pursued them, only to halt. Yet it is they who halt.\"\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Zizhan said: \"When yin flourishes in Pi and reaches Bo, the noble has never failed to dwell within its midst. Then, with two yin lying beneath four yang, yin still cannot overcome yang—yet the noble meets with misfortune. Why? The noble’s error is not one of abandonment or irretrievable loss; it is believed to hold the path of prosperity.\"\n\nYun said: \"Among the sixty-four hexagrams, the fifth line is always the ruler’s position. Yet sometimes one in this position lacks the ruler’s virtue, while another in a different position possesses it.\"\n\nJiao Ruohou said: \"The character *fei* (肥) was anciently written as *pi* (琶), resembling *bei* (輩). Later generations mistook *ling* (鸰) for *fei*.\" The *Nine Masters’ Daoist Teachings* states: \"To retreat yet take flight—what greater fortune could there be?\" Zhang Heng’s *Rhapsody on Contemplating the Mysterious* says: \"Longing to take flight and retreat to preserve one’s name.\" Cao Zhi’s *Seven Stimuli* declares: \"Taking flight to depart from the vulgar.\" The *Jinling She Mountain Stele* recalls: \"Cherishing thoughts of flight and retreat.\" All serve as evidence.\n\nWang Ji said: \"Petty men’s deep resentment arises from the noble’s provocation. Without malice yet stern—how could one incite hatred with harsh words or fierce demeanor? Speech is humble, conduct upright; appearance gentle, heart resolute. Seeking no flaws to slander, no blemishes to mar—stern as heaven, which none dare violate.\" In this hexagram, the first, fourth, second, and fifth lines correspond to four yang, governing with firmness—this is the image of \"without malice yet stern.\"\n\n**Hexagram 34: Great Vigour (Dazhuang) – Radiance in Rectitude**\n*The Judgment*: \"Great Vigour. Radiance in rectitude. The great is vigorous. Firmness in motion—thus vigour. Great Vigour. Radiance in rectitude. The great is rectitude. In rectitude and greatness, the sentiments of heaven and earth are revealed.\"\n*The Image*: \"Thunder above heaven—Great Vigour. The noble refrains from treading where propriety does not permit.\"\n- **First Nine**: \"Vigour in the toes. Advancing brings misfortune. Yet there is sincerity.\"\n  *The Image*: \"Vigour in the toes—its sincerity is exhausted.\"\n- **Nine in the Second**: \"Rectitude brings good fortune.\"\n  *The Image*: \"Nine in the Second’s rectitude brings good fortune—through centrality.\"\n- **Nine in the Third**: \"The petty man employs vigour; the noble employs restraint. Rectitude is perilous. The ram butts the fence, entangling its horns.\"\n  *The Image*: \"The petty man employs vigour; the noble employs restraint.\"\n- **Nine in the Fourth**: \"Rectitude brings good fortune; regret vanishes. The fence is breached, no entanglement. Vigour in the great carriage’s shafts.\"\n  *The Image*: \"The fence breached, no entanglement—advancing is esteemed.\"\n- **Six in the Fifth**: \"Losing the ram at Yi. No regret.\"\n  *The Image*: \"Losing the ram at Yi—position is inappropriate.\"\n- **Top Six**: \"The ram butts the fence, unable to retreat or advance. No advantage. Hardship brings good fortune.\"\n  *The Image*: \"Unable to retreat or advance—this is inauspicious. Hardship brings good fortune—misfortune does not endure.\"\n\n**Hexagram 34: Thunder over Heaven – Great Vigour**\nFang Shihua said: \"Only the Nine in the Fourth embodies the firm and active line, thus movement in rectitude brings good fortune. Movement dispels regret; the fence’s path opens wide, the carriage’s shafts are sturdy—how can one hesitate to advance? This is the great one’s vigour, hence *Great Vigour*; this is the great one’s rectitude, hence *Great Vigour*. Radiance in rectitude, greatness and rectitude—thus are heaven and earth. Without rectitude, how could one act? Thus the Nine in the Second, abiding centrally and unmoving, attains rectitude and good fortune. The First Nine, at the base and far from the thunder’s body—how could it hastily act? Thus its toes seem vigorous, yet advance brings misfortune. Even with yang’s solid sincerity, it will surely meet exhaustion. The Nine in the Third, though adjacent to thunder, still faces a fence—how can it recklessly butt? Overly firm and uncentered, it employs vigour directly—thus the sage says: this is the petty man’s affair; the noble must not act thus. When the noble encounters vigour, it knows only rectitude. Thus vigour may be possessed, but not employed. To employ vigour is perilous even in rectitude—like the ram butting the fence, its horns entangled. The horns are merely entangled, the fence remains unbreached—what is this if not restraint? Thus the image is borrowed to depict restraint’s form, a profound warning to the noble. Should one rely on the Six in the Fifth’s ease and overlook the error of employing vigour? Though the Fifth is easygoing and overlooks one’s error, does it not also overlook one’s merit? Emperor Wen of Han said: 'Alas! You did not meet your era. Had you lived in Gaozu’s time, a marquisate of ten thousand households would be nothing.' Thus he lost the ram at Yi. Emperor Wen, a ruler of gentle centrality, governed with ease, simplicity, and leniency. Though the many yang were vigorous, none employed their vigour. The ram, though sturdy, cannot be vigorous on level ground. Though the Fifth lost the ram, it remained unaware of regret—this is the art of governing, the method of halting movement. To restrain vigour’s force, leaving no fence to invite butting—is this not the excellence of the yielding overcoming the firm? Yet in the time of Great Vigour, one must not be complacent. The Top Six corresponds to the Third. The sage says: 'The ram butts the fence'—in its own line, this incurs the error of employing vigour, but in its proper correspondence, one must carefully examine the entangled horns’ hardship and the difficulty of union. It is not fitting to force it—unable to retreat or advance, advancing brings no advantage, and one remains forever burdened by the error of employing vigour.\"\n\nAfter traversing the Fourth and Fifth lines, one finally encounters such hardship—like Yi Yin with Tang. Yet while the world may suspect him of self-seeking and fault him for his culinary guise, Tang discerned in him a minister of singular virtue. Though the beginning was arduous, the end proved auspicious, and one may indeed be assured that no lasting fault would ensue.\n\nThe difficulty of encountering *Great Vigour* lies not merely in heeding its warning against employing force, nor in resolutely adhering to what is beneficial and upright. Rather, those in high position must broadly open the gates of rightful conduct, lest they allow entangled horns to persist. For in the time of *Great Vigour*, when the yang virtue flourishes, the donning of caps and the tying of sashes are inevitable even for the greatest worthies. The sage, in setting forth this image, establishes a stern admonition, seeking only to guide them toward rectitude.\n\nYet those in authority who fail to \"spit out their food\" or \"loosen their hair\" to gather such men—like the lord of Han Wen, whose virtue was not without merit—ultimately leave Li Guang unennobled and Jia Yi to die in resentment. How could they be so reckless with talent? Did they not regard others’ skills as their own, cherishing the wise and sagely as if they sprang from their own lips?\n\nThus, the Fifth Line speaks solely of its misplaced position, while the Top Line further judges its failure to deliberate and act accordingly.\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Zizhan said: \"In its upright greatness, the true sentiment of Heaven and Earth is revealed. To take the greater as the upright—this is the utmost sincerity of Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nYang Jian said: \"*Great Vigour* in Heaven and Earth manifests as the ascendancy of the four yang lines, where yang qi is most robust. In the state, it signifies the advancement of the noble multitude, whose momentum is mighty. In virtue, it represents the attainment of the Great Dao. When Confucius reached thirty, he stood firm—unshakable in his vigour. The yielding of the world cannot be vigorous; only the firm can be so. Yet even the firm, if unmoving, cannot display its vigour. Thus it is said: 'Through firmness in motion, vigour arises.'\"\n\nThe Nine in the Fourth, with its odd line obstructing its path, strikes the fence with entangled horns—an image of the Nine occupying the Third’s place. Moreover, at the culmination of the *Qian* hexagram, the petty man employs force. The Six in the Fifth, positioned ahead, is paired yet hollow, like a fence’s shadow.\n\nLiu Junbo said: \"*Qian* is the wheel and chariot; vigour resides in the wheel, and the wheel’s vigour lies in the shaft.\"\n\nYang Tingxiu said: \"The Six in the Fifth, amid the flourishing strength of the many yang below, is able to pacify them. Yet it loses itself—precisely through the virtue of yielding compliance and harmonious ease that subdues them. Thus, it incurs no regret. The ram represents the four yang lines.\"\n\n**Hexagram 35: Advance (Jin)**\n*Kang Hou* is granted horses in abundance, thrice received in a single day.\n\n**The Judgment** says: *Advance* means progress. Light emerges above the earth, compliant yet clinging to great brightness. The yielding advances and ascends—thus *Kang Hou* is granted horses in abundance and thrice received in a single day.\n\n**The Image** says: Light emerges above the earth—*Advance*. The noble one thereby illuminates his own bright virtue.\n\n**Line Statements**\n**Initial Six:** Advancing, yet crushed—persistent, auspicious. Without trust, yet at ease—no fault.\n**The Image** says: Advancing, yet crushed—walking alone in rectitude. At ease without fault—no mandate has been received.\n\n**Six in the Second:** Advancing, yet sorrowful—persistent, auspicious. Receiving this great blessing from the Queen Mother.\n**The Image** says: Receiving this great blessing—through central correctness.\n\n**Six in the Third:** The multitude assents—regret vanishes.\n**The Image** says: The multitude’s assent—its aspiration ascends.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Advancing like a hamster—persistent, perilous.\n**The Image** says: A hamster’s persistence in peril—its position is misplaced.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Regret vanishes. Loss and gain need not be fretted—going forth is auspicious, with no misfortune.\n**The Image** says: Loss and gain need not be fretted—going forth brings celebration.\n\n**Top Nine:** Advancing with its horns—only to be used in punishing its own domain. Perilous, yet auspicious—no fault. Persistent, regrettable.\n**The Image** says: Only to be used in punishing its own domain—the Dao is not yet radiant.\n\n**Fire over Earth: Advance**\nLight emerges above the earth—its Dao is greatly bright. *Advance* is the time of brightness. Here, it is not called \"bright advance\" but \"advancing advance\" because the single yielding line ascends and moves upward, dwelling at the center of *Li* and occupying the Fifth’s position, thereby illuminating all under Heaven. Thus, it is called \"advance.\" Moreover, the three yin lines of the *Kun* body are all lords who secure the state, compliant and advancing in unison to cling to the lord of great brightness—hence, it is also called \"advance.\" Advancing thus, *Kang Hou* is granted horses in abundance and thrice received in a single day. The \"three receptions\" refer to the three yin lines.\n\nNow observe the Six in the Fifth: as a lord of cultured brightness and yielding centrality, it broadly extends the earth’s measure, universally illuminating all. Toward the feudal lords of the time, whatever their losses or gains, it refrains from reckoning or contesting. Thus, those below are wholly seen in their sincerity, and going forth is auspicious, with no misfortune.\n\nThough a yin occupying a yang position should incur regret, dwelling at the center of *Li* with its virtue greatly bright, all below comply—thus, its regret vanishes.\n\nThe Initial Six, though advancing, is immediately crushed—this is not advancing with the gaze of advance. To advance yet be crushed is to regard advance as crushing. The Six in the Second, though advancing, appears sorrowful—this is regarding advance with sorrow, not advancing with the gaze of advance. Dwelling in a yielding, compliant position amid the bright time of *Advance*, why should there be crushing or sorrow? Yet the Initial Six, at the lowest position, suddenly ascends—if there is something above that crushes it, it dare not advance further, displaying the utmost humility and deference. Thus, its persistence is auspicious. It may be at ease, yet without trust—though it does not trust the Fourth, what fault is there? Walking alone in rectitude suffices.\n\nThe Six in the Second, centrally positioned, advances in *Advance*. Though advancement may be joyful, its center is not joyful—revealing its outward compliance and inner emptiness. Thus, its persistence is auspicious. Receiving this great blessing from the Queen Mother—is this not fitting?\n\nThe Six in the Third, having reached the utmost of compliance, ascends in shared trust, its aspiration directed upward. Yet it ought not advance precipitously—only when the multitude consents may it proceed, for advancement harbors the seeds of regret, lest regret remain unavoidable.\n\nThe First, the Second, and the Third—all are compliant, all are marquises who pacify the state. From the Fifth’s perspective, all are deemed “obtained,” all are those of whom it is said: “Obtain and do not worry; to proceed is auspicious, while primacy brings no advantage.” Only the Fourth, with its Nine in residence, occupies a position not its own. With hardness lodged in advancement, it is not compliant. Active by night and hidden by day, it cannot advance in daylight—it is but a rat in the shadows. Dwelling beneath the radiance of *Clarity*, it dare not face the illumination of *Clarity*, thus forfeiting its own brightness. Yet from the Fifth’s perspective, it is precisely “loss without worry; to proceed is auspicious, while primacy brings no advantage.” If it cannot advance by day, how could it not be tolerated beneath the midday sky?\n\nThe Nine at the Top, excessively rigid, stands at the extremity of *Advance*. Taking the Fourth as its fellow townsman, it deploys force to subdue the town, unaware of the peril. Though it loves gain and detests loss, this is its good fortune; this is its freedom from blame; this is the way of rectitude. Yet regret and humiliation remain inescapable.\n\nAt this time, above stands a ruler who “loses without worry,” below stand ministers—crushed yet sorrowful, awaiting the multitude’s consent—above and below at peace, *Advance* unceasing, no leisure even to wield horns in victory. From this, it is clear: the defense of “three standards and five baits” would never be employed in an age of rotting grain and decaying coin. If only the world’s primal grievances are resolved, a single廷尉 suffices—why fret over rats usurping positions? Thus, the aged need not attend court with staff in hand—why bind the neck of the *Chanyu*? A Lu Jia is envoy enough—why fetter the head of the Southern Yue? Even if there were a young scion of Luoyang, a thousand gold pledged in a single vow, he would still die young in Daliang or grow old in Hebei—what profit lies in those who deploy force to subdue towns? Therefore it is said: “Deploying force to subdue towns—this Way is not yet luminous.”\n\nOnly when great clarity advances in broad daylight, its radiance resplendent, does compliance become effortless. This is why the *Kang* Marquis was granted steeds in abundance, received audience thrice in a single day. King Wen longed for such a time but could not attain it, hence his singular admiration.\n\nWhen brightness emerges above the earth, it is *Advance*; when it sinks beneath the earth, it is *Obscured Brilliance*—how grievous! Liu Yongxiang said: How do we know the three yin lines of *Advance* are all marquises who pacify the state? It is King Wen, the Nine Marquis, and the E Marquis—who in all the world for ten thousand generations would say otherwise? Rightly so, then, that he had no leisure for daytime audiences.\n\n**Appendix**\n\nYang Jian said: \"The *Jie* hexagram signifies great transformation. The Grandmother is also called the Queen Mother, the tranquility of the king—likewise termed the Queen Mother. The *duan-shu* is the five-skilled rat, as Lu Mingde notes. The *Bencao* states the mole cricket is also called the *duan-shu*. Xu Shen’s *Shuowen* says: The *duan* is the five-skilled rat, able to fly yet unable to pass over a house, able to climb yet unable to scale a tree’s heights, able to swim yet unable to cross a valley, able to burrow yet unable to conceal itself, able to run yet unable to outpace others. *Xunzi* says: The *duan-shu*, though possessing five skills, remains trapped. Yang Lü’s annotated edition of the *Shuowen*—my fellow townsman Lou’s *Shangshu* also glosses the *Shuowen*—differs from the *Ode*’s *shuo-shu*.\n\nYang Tingxiu said: The second six, through its yielding virtue, encounters a lord of civil brilliance, occupying the position of advancement and flourishing. Abiding in the center and upholding correctness, it regards advancement with concern rather than delight. Thus it may attain good fortune and receive the great blessing of abundant steeds and thrice-daily audiences from its lord. The Queen Mother embodies the lord’s yielding center—this is the sixth five. Cheng Zhengshu said: The will ascends, desiring to rise and align with great clarity. To follow the lord of great brilliance—this is the shared aspiration of all. Wang Ji said: When the sun first emerges from the earth, advancing and ascending, it forms the image of *Advance*. When the sun rises above the earth, it is bright; when it sinks beneath, it is dark. The sun’s brilliance is fundamentally without increase or decrease—only a matter of being obscured or unobscured. The noble one, observing the image of brightness emerging above the earth, awakens to the inherent luminosity of the nature and substance, thus illuminating his own bright virtue. The noble one’s learning—whether called self-deception, self-entrapment, self-return, self-attainment, self-clarification, self-illumination, or self-knowledge—is never dependent on anything external.\n\n**Hexagram 36: *Mingyi* (Obscured Brilliance) – Fire below, Earth above**\n*Mingyi*: Beneficial to persist in adversity with steadfastness.\n\n**The Judgment** says: Brilliance enters the earth—*Mingyi*. Within, civil brilliance; without, yielding compliance, enduring great hardship—King Wen embodied this. Beneficial to persist in adversity with steadfastness: this is to obscure one’s brilliance. Though beset by internal strife, one can rectify one’s will—Jizi exemplified this.\n\n**The Image** says: Brilliance enters the earth—*Mingyi*. The noble one, in governing the multitude, employs obscurity to achieve clarity.\n\n**Line 1 (Nine at the bottom):** In *Mingyi*, it flies with drooping wings. The noble one, in travel, goes three days without eating. Though there is somewhere to go, the host has words [of reproach].\n\n**The Image** says: The noble one, in travel, righteously refuses to eat.\n\n**Line 2 (Six in the second place):** In *Mingyi*, wounded in the left thigh, employing a strong horse for rescue—good fortune.\n\n**The Image** says: The good fortune of the second six arises from compliance with principle.\n\n**Line 3 (Nine in the third place):** In *Mingyi*, hunting in the south, seizing the great chief—yet one must not hasten to steadfastness.\n\n**The Image** says: The will in southern hunting is to achieve great success.\n\n**Line 4 (Six in the fourth place):** Entering the left abdomen, grasping the heart of *Mingyi*, then exiting the gate and courtyard.\n\n**The Image** says: Entering the left abdomen, one seizes the heart’s intent.\n\n**Line 5 (Six in the fifth place):** Jizi’s *Mingyi*—beneficial to be steadfast.\n\n**The Image** says: Jizi’s steadfastness—brilliance cannot be extinguished.\n\n**Line 6 (Six at the top):** Not bright but dark—first ascending to heaven, later entering the earth.\n\n**The Image** says: First ascending to heaven, it illuminates the four lands. Later entering the earth—this is to lose principle.\n\n**Earth over Fire: *Mingyi***\nBoth the *Judgment* and *Image* speak of brilliance entering the earth. *Mingyi* originally only signifies the image of not seeing the sun and sky, the world’s darkness. The topmost line alone directly describes what is not bright but dark: first ascending to heaven, later entering the earth—this is the image of not bright but dark. Like King Zhou, though a ruler of unyielding strength, what could he do but lose principle? To lose principle is to abandon the Dao—thus he became dark. In *Mingyi*, none is more illustrious than King Wen. From the first to the fourth line, who but he could have embodied this? Though possessing inner civil brilliance and outer yielding compliance, he was not exempt from enduring great hardship. Thus, in the time of *Mingyi*, how could one not persist in adversity with steadfastness, fully obscuring one’s brilliance?\n\nThe *Mingyi* of the first nine begins at Youli. Its image: in flight, it droops its wings; in travel, it goes three days without eating; in going forth, the host has words. What could the sage do in such circumstances? Only submit to heaven. The *Mingyi* of the second six is also afflicted at Youli. Its image: wounded in the left thigh, one cannot but swiftly rescue it. Having rescued it, one cannot but employ a strong horse. This is to comply with the people’s hearts and align with heaven’s principles—good fortune indeed. The third nine is the conduct of all worthy ministers. What could the sage dare to know of this? Only to comply with the multitude. In the rites of the hunt, great beasts are offered to the lord, small beasts kept for oneself. As the *Ode* says: \"Privately I keep the fawn, but present the fattened boar to the lord\"—this is the way. The third nine hunts in the south of *Li*, seizing the great chief to present to the lord. The unknowing deem this hasty, but the wise regard it as steadfast—this is the sage’s great fulfillment of will. How could it be easily discussed with ordinary people? Thus, by the fourth six, one emerges from confinement. Entering the lord’s left abdomen, grasping the lord’s heart and intent, one at last exits the gate and courtyard to achieve survival. This is what is meant by: only after being wounded here does one emerge. The image: the lower three lines represent the sun falling to earth, possessing the image of entry. The fourth line, positioned above the setting sun, possesses the image of exit. Thus, from the fourth six downward, all represent King Wen’s *Mingyi*. The *Judgment*’s \"beneficial to persist in adversity with steadfastness\" is fully manifest here.\n\nWhen brilliance is not bright but instead becomes dark, even the sage cannot avoid entering the earth and being wounded. Yet when one persists in adversity with steadfastness and employs obscurity, even the most violent can grasp the heart’s intent and emerge above the earth.\n\nWho would claim that the phrase \"beneficial to persist in adversity with steadfastness\" is not the subtle wisdom by which King Wen exited the gate and courtyard? The six in the fifth place, obscuring himself alongside the lord, truly embodies the *Mingyi* of Jizi. Feigning madness to avoid the deepest obscurity—yet people see only his obscurity, who knows how his brilliance never ceased? What is called \"the more obscure, the more brilliant\" was not merely unceasing in that moment, but persists through ten thousand ages without end. It is not that it does not cease, but that it *cannot* cease.\n\nXiong Nansha said: \"Great peril is the peril of the world; inner peril is the peril of a single household.\" Moreover, *Li* (Fire) possesses the image of a flying bird. *Kun* (Earth) represents the belly, and *Li* also represents the belly. Lü Zhongmu and Cai Jiefu noted: \"The heart lies in the left belly,\" as seen in medical texts. Scholar Li #12 said: \"Great peril is external peril. Only external peril can be strategized against, seeking exit is possible, for obscurity and brilliance do not enter. If it is inner peril, one cannot exit, nor can one enter—truly perilous indeed.\" Thus, Jizi’s *Mingyi* never ceases in obscurity, nor does his brilliance cease. The Master specifically praised this, without needing to reiterate the warning of \"persistence in adversity with steadfastness.\"\n\nHeaven and earth have their times of obscurity and brilliance; the sage moves in accord with the times, and thus cannot avoid turning toward obscurity to rest. If one were to say, \"I inwardly possess civil brilliance while outwardly appearing gentle and compliant, so I should not suddenly suffer great peril,\" this would inevitably lead to resentment toward heaven and blame of others. How could one know that inner civil brilliance must outwardly radiate light—how could it be concealed? Only when brilliance enters the earth, utterly obscuring its light, can primordial brilliance become visible, as with Jizi. This is deeply embodying the image of the *Yi*, aligning with the time of *Mingyi*. Thus, King Wen decisively recognized this as Jizi’s *Mingyi*, while viewing himself as deficient. How profound and admirable is one who knows not \"persistence in adversity with steadfastness\"! Were King Wen not a great sage, who could be moved to such self-reflection?\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Ji said: \"The sun rises majestically and sets in Yu Yuan—this is the image of *Mingyi*. The noble one observes the image of brilliance entering the earth and employs obscurity to become brilliant. For if one employs brilliance, one scrutinizes human sentiments, which leads to alienation and unease. Only by employing obscurity does brilliance attain the way of moving among the multitude. This is the meaning of 'hanging tassels and expanding light'—scrutinizing the fish in the abyss is inauspicious.\"\n\n*Li* below, *Xun* above: *Jiaren* (The Family). Beneficial for the woman to persist in steadfastness.\n**Judgment:** *Jiaren*: The woman holds her proper position within, the man holds his proper position without. When man and woman are correct, this is the great principle of heaven and earth. In the family, there is a stern lord—this refers to the parents. When father acts as father, son as son, elder brother as elder brother, younger brother as younger brother, husband as husband, and wife as wife, the family way is correct. When the family is correct, the world is settled.\n**Image:** Wind emerges from fire—*Jiaren*. The noble one, in speech, has substance, and in conduct, has constancy.\n\n**First Nine:** Guarding the household, regret vanishes.\n**Image:** Guarding the household—his aspiration has not changed.\n\n**Six in the Second:** Without self-seeking, engaging in central tasks, steadfastness brings good fortune.\n**Image:** The good fortune of the six in the second—submissive and yielding.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** The family sighs in distress—regret and danger, yet good fortune. The wife and children laugh recklessly—ultimately, humiliation.\n**Image:** The family sighs in distress—yet nothing is lost. The wife and children laugh recklessly—losing the family’s discipline.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** Enriching the household—great good fortune.\n**Image:** Enriching the household, great good fortune—submissive in one’s position.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** The king approaches the household—do not worry, good fortune.\n**Image:** The king approaches the household—mutual love.\n\n**Top Nine:** Possessing sincerity and dignity—ultimately, good fortune.\n**Image:** The good fortune of dignity—this means returning to oneself.\n\n**Feng Huo Jiaren**\nFang Shihua said: \"From the two women, the image of 'having a family' is taken, hence *Jiaren*. And it further emphasizes: 'beneficial for the woman to persist in steadfastness.'\" Reading the *Guan Ju* poem, moved by the music of zither, se, bells, and drums, I know the sage personally experienced its fullness. The Master joyfully praised it, saying: \"If the woman holds her proper position within, then the man must hold his proper position without. There has never been a man who could not hold his proper position without yet enable the woman alone to hold hers within.\" King Wen attributed virtue to the queen consort, hence he alone said: \"beneficial for the woman to persist in steadfastness.\" The Master attributed virtue to King Wen, hence he added: \"the man holds his proper position without\"—how profound!\n\nToday’s husband and wife are tomorrow’s parents. Today’s man and woman are tomorrow’s stern lords. If the positions of today’s man and woman are correct, then the positions of tomorrow’s father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife—none in the entire family will fail to be correct. Thus, it is said: \"When one family is correct, the world is settled.\" Alas! The settling of the world is seen in the family. The correctness of the family begins with man and woman. How then could man and woman be a trivial matter? How could the family be a trivial affair?\n\nWhen Yao bestowed his two daughters upon Yu, this was how he harmonized the myriad states. When Shun observed his conduct toward his two wives, this was how he yielded the throne and brought order to the world. The matter is not trivial, nor are the people insignificant—how clear this is! For all who have families, how can they not consider the benefit of the woman’s steadfastness in holding her proper position within, and model themselves after these two women to hold their proper position without?\n\nHolding one’s proper position without is to be a stern lord. Sternness does not mean sighing in distress or laughing recklessly. When one’s dignity is not forced yet appears dignified, when sincerity’s dignity arises without anger—this is good fortune. Returning to oneself to be correct, each resting in their proper place—this is dignity. Not esteeming sternness, yet the family all perceives a stern lord—this is what it means to hold one’s proper position without. Alas! Holding one’s proper position without—this is perfection.\n\nHolding one’s proper position without, then the woman’s position naturally aligns, presiding over inner accomplishments without daring to overstep her duties. She but follows with compliance and yields to the five relations—this alone. To enrich the household is thus most auspicious.\n\nShe but follows with compliance and heeds the one who holds position. For compliance is the woman’s steadfastness, and thus the woman takes compliance alone as right—no other excellence. Would she dare, even in death, to employ her own strengths? This is indeed moved by the virtue and power of the one, and naturally, silently follows Heaven’s pattern without words—it is not in vain.\n\nThe primal concern of the five relations is not to add what is fitting with laughter. The *Shuowen* states: \"The sound of excess, 'enriching the household is most auspicious.'\" Yang Jingzhong and Jin Rubai have spoken well of this.\n\nTo take enriching the household as most auspicious, and to take enrichment as the power of compliance—when one holds position, enrichment is the urgent task of all who have families. Who would deem enrichment unworthy of the learning of the Dao? But one must obtain it by the Way.\n\nThus it is said:\n\nThe noble person cherishes wealth but obtains it by the Way.\n\n**Appendix**\nXue Rengui said: \"When clarity resides within, the household naturally speaks with one accord. Internally, there is separation from clarity, while externally, compliance and harmony prevail.\"\n\nWang Fusi said: \"All teaching lies in the beginning, and all governance in the inception of the household. If one waits until records are kept before enforcing strict discipline, or until changes occur before implementing order, regret will follow. At the outset of managing a household, at the very beginning of its formation, one must first establish boundaries—only then can regret vanish.\"\n\nYang Jingzhong said: \"The Way of governing a household lies in preventing transgressions at the outset, so that deviant and perverse intentions never arise. Only then can regret be averted. It is not called 'the absence of initial regret' but 'the vanishing of regret' because governing a household is difficult—difficult indeed to avoid initial regret. Emperor Yao was a great sage yet could not prevent Dan Zhu from indulging in licentious company. The Duke of Zhou was a great sage yet could not stop Guan and Cai from spreading slander. Thus, it is indeed difficult to speak of avoiding initial regret.\"\n\nWei Xuanzheng said: \"The *Xiang Zhuan* states 'compliant and yielding,' referring to the second line rightfully submitting to the fifth. In all matters, one follows father and husband, never attaining one’s own will.\"\n\nXiong Nansha said: \"The sound *dīdī* was written as *gǎo* by Liu Xiang. The *Book of Songs* says, 'In harmony like *gǎo*,' while the *Zhou Odes* express *xī* most emphatically. *Yī* and *xī* are both exclamations, with *xīxī* being more intense than *gǎogǎo*. It is a sigh of unbearable frustration, not an instruction to laugh. Since the Han dynasty, all have pronounced it as the reverse of *dīdī*. Wang Hui of the Song doubted that the *Chonggang* hexagram originally contained laughter, yet he alone grasped the hexagram’s true sentiment. The third line, being strong, makes its wife and children unable to endure, sighing in distress. How could this not bring misfortune? It differs entirely from the awe-inspiring presence of the topmost line.\"\n\nYu Zhongxiang said: \"Holding position and responding to the initial line, submitting to the fifth while riding over the third, and aligning with the three yang lines—thus 'enriching the household is most auspicious.'\"\n\nJingzhong added: \"Both the second and fourth lines are yin and yielding, embodying utmost compliance. Compliance brings harmony, and harmony brings wealth. The proverb says: 'Ten people, ten minds—no wealth, only sealed markets. Ten people, one mind—wealth, golden markets.' This is true indeed.\"\n\nJin Rubai said: \"The second line holds the central position, hence it is called 'compliant.' Responding to the fifth and embodying yielding, it is called 'yielding'—meaning it can enter into harmony with the fifth through the Way of compliance.\" He further said: \"The fourth line is yin and empty, like the fourth line of *Tai*. Yet that one speaks of 'not enriching,' while this one speaks of 'enriching'—why? Because enrichment lies in the fourth, and thus enrichment lies in the fifth. The fifth, central and correct, occupies the honored position, while the fourth, by submitting to it, preserves its household. Hence it is said, 'compliant in position.'\"\n\nYang Tingxiu said: \"The fifth line, with the firm clarity of *Qian*’s virtue, resides in the central position of *Xun*, rightfully occupying the supreme place of the state and household, thereby influencing its family. King Wen as ruler, Tai Si as consort, Wang Ji as father, Tai Ren as mother, King Wu as son, and Yi Jiang as daughter-in-law—did they not love one another reciprocally? Thus the poet sang: 'He set an example for his humble wife, extending to his brothers, and so governed his state and household'—this is mutual love. Confucius praised him, saying, 'Without anxiety—this was King Wen.' This is 'no worry, auspicious.'\"\n\nWang Ji said: \"*Xun* is wind, *Li* is fire. When fire blazes, wind arises. Fire is the mother of wind. The noble person, observing the image of wind emerging from fire, understands that the root of moral transformation arises from the household. The root of the household, in turn, arises from the self. What emerges from the self? Only words and deeds. When words and deeds align, the self is cultivated. With self-cultivation, the Way of ordering the household, governing the state, and bringing peace to all under Heaven emerges from this. This is knowing the origin of wind.\"\n\n---\n**Fire above Marsh (38) *Kui*: Auspicious for minor matters.**\n**The *Tuan* says:** *Kui*: Fire moves upward, the marsh moves downward. Two women dwell together, yet their aspirations do not align. Joy clings to clarity; the yielding advances and ascends, attaining the center and responding to the firm—thus minor matters are auspicious. Heaven and Earth are apart, yet their affairs are the same; man and woman are apart, yet their aspirations commune; the myriad things are apart, yet their affairs are alike. The utility of *Kui* in its time is great indeed!\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** Fire above, marsh below—*Kui*. The noble person harmonizes while remaining distinct.\n\n**Line 1 (Yang):** Regret vanishes. A lost horse—do not pursue it; it will return of its own accord. Encountering an evil person—no blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Encountering an evil person is to avoid blame.\n\n**Line 2 (Yang):** Meeting one’s lord in the alley—no blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Meeting one’s lord in the alley is not losing the Way.\n\n**Line 3 (Yin):** Seeing a cart dragged back, its oxen restrained, its driver branded and mutilated—yet initially there was a good end.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Seeing a cart dragged back is due to an improper position. Initially there was a good end—this is encountering firmness.\n\n**Line 4 (Yang):** *Kui* in solitude, meeting the primal man, mutual trust—danger, no blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Mutual trust, no blame—this is the fulfillment of aspiration.\n\n**Line 5 (Yin):** Regret vanishes. One’s clan bites through flesh—where is the blame in advancing?\n**The *Xiang* says:** One’s clan bites through flesh—advancing brings good fortune.\n\n**Line 6 (Yang):** *Kui* in solitude, seeing a pig laden with mud, a cart full of ghosts. First drawing the bow, then lowering it—it is not a bandit but a marriage match. Advancing to meet rain—auspicious.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Meeting rain—auspicious, as all doubts vanish.\n\n**Fire and Marsh *Kui***\nFang Shihua said: \"Horses pair before moving. The first and fourth lines correspond—is this not a natural loss? Yet in the end, they unite—is this not 'do not pursue, it returns of its own accord'? However, the fourth is in *Kui* with the first, and the first resembles an evil person to the fourth. Now, if the first does not align with the fourth, this is *Kui*. Then the first is truly the 'primal man' to the fourth—what blame could there be? The lower follows the upper, hence the lower speaks of avoiding blame. The upper responds to the lower, hence the upper speaks of fulfilling aspiration.\"\n\nXiong Nansha said: \"The fourth is called '*Kui* in solitude'—below, it can still stand alone; above, it cannot lack support—this is so.\"\n\n**The second and fifth lines form a proper correspondence.** Thus, the second attains its \"encounter in the alley,\" while the fifth personally relishes its concerns within its clan. For the second takes the fifth as its master, and the fifth takes the second as its origin—going forth brings felicity, so what blame could there be? *Li*’s center is empty, resembling an alley.\n\n**The top yang and third yin lines are excessively solitary in their estrangement,** yet as they encounter firmness, they must ultimately unite. At first, estrangement breeds doubt. If the third were to see the second dragging its carriage, the fourth pulling its ox upward, and the top descending from the heavens to slit its nose—would this not be so? In truth, how could such things exist? If the top were to see the third’s mount as no ox but a mud-smeared boar, its load as no person but a cartful of ghosts, it would first draw its bow, taking them for bandits to shoot—only later to recognize them as its marriage kin, lowering the bow without loosing the arrow. Doubts multiply, and thus the third and top become estranged. Yet when they go forth, they meet the rain, and all doubts dissolve—hence their final union.\n\n**Tuweng said:** Estrangement is the natural state of heaven and earth; estrangement resolving into union is their inevitable course. The *Xiang* commentary is exhaustive. Yet people in this world often create estrangement where none exists. Thus, some lines are fundamentally in correspondence yet become estranged—such is the case with the fourth and first. The first does not perceive estrangement; it is the topmost line that does. This is estrangement unseen, the estrangement of the highest. Some lines, though in mutual response, are not estranged—such are the second and fifth. When one goes forth, the other meets it; meeting, they unite; uniting, they flourish. Others are solitary yang without correspondence, inherently estranged—yet even they may come to see themselves as estranged, like the fourth line. Had it not encountered the primal man of the first yang, how could it have escaped the peril of solitude? When the fourth man meets the primal man, are they not two true men? Their mutual trust is fitting. Moreover, the fourth, upon meeting the primal man, immediately trusts him—this could not be so if it did not share the first’s aspiration. Thus it is said: \"Mutual trust brings no blame; the aspiration is fulfilled.\" Once the aspiration is realized, mutual trust follows naturally.\n\nAs for the third yin and top yang, they are a proper union of yin and yang, never exhibiting estrangement or solitude—yet the top perceives them as estranged, as bandits, as boars, as ghosts, in endless distortions. The sweetness of *Dui*’s marsh turns to mud—how absurd! The third, meanwhile, sees the second dragging its carriage, the fourth pulling its ox, and the top descending from the heavens to slit its nose—how bizarre! They are not estranged, yet they see estrangement—such is the nature of most estrangement in the world. Hence it is said: \"There is a beginning, there is an end.\" And again: \"Meeting the rain brings good fortune.\" Was the rain not always the rain of *Dui*’s marsh? Did it ever lose its beginning or fail to correspond? Seeing estrangement, one calls it a beginning without end, inauspicious; seeing union, one calls it an end, auspicious. How grievous is the harm of perception!\n\nIn this hexagram, only the fifth yin line, centered and responsive, corresponds with the second yang’s firmness. Thus, the fifth goes forth to meet the second, and the second bears the fifth’s going. Is this not like Emperor Taizu of Song visiting Prime Minister Pu on a snowy night, where Pu’s wife served wine and roasted meat over glowing coals—the very \"encounter with the master in the alley\" and \"the clan relishing the flesh\"?\n\nAs for the first line, the marsh stirs below, delighting in the marsh’s sweetness and willingly dwelling in filth—it harbors no intent of estrangement. Thus, the horse may be lost, yet it may also return. If lost, let it be lost of its own accord—who could pursue it? If it returns, let it return of its own will—who could compel it? Such is its indifference to the world’s concerns. And this is not all.\n\nThe wicked are those no one wishes to see—yet are they not also human? Why then set oneself apart in estrangement? Fault is what all seek to avoid—yet am I not human as well? Why then insist on separation? Thus, the first line alone is called the \"primordial man,\" and truly so. As for the primordial man, how fortunate is the fourth yang to have such an encounter! Below the primordial man lies the second yang’s firmness and centeredness—its firmness and centeredness that bring about the \"encounter in the alley.\" And below that, does not the topmost yang’s firmness also meet? Without the top’s firmness, how could the third achieve its good end? Therefore, the noble person values firmness.\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Shi’s explanation: If one knows only conformity, then estrangement is inevitable. If one knows that estrangement can lead to achievement, then conformity is assured.\nThe Bald Elder says: If one knows only conformity, then estrangement is inevitable. If one knows that one cannot but be estranged, then conformity is assured. Thus it is said: In their shared dwelling, the two women’s aspirations differ, and in the end, each returns to her own place. How could they not be estranged? Yet when they are estranged, heaven and earth are estranged, yet their work is the same—they share the task of generating life. Male and female are estranged, yet their aspirations commune—they share the intent of mutual response. The myriad things are estranged, yet their tasks are of a kind—they share the work of nurturing life. How then could they not be in accord? Alike yet different, estranged yet united—from heaven and earth downward, none is not thus. Therefore it is said: The utility of the time of estrangement is great indeed! When it speaks of \"small matters being auspicious,\" it is because yang is great and yin is small, and the image is taken from the two women’s differing paths. Yet only after their estrangement do they each find union, and thus it is specifically stated: \"small matters are auspicious.\" This does not mean that estrangement is only auspicious for small matters.\n\nYang Jian says: The fourth and first lines are both yang, an image of two yangs fundamentally unresponsive, hence estrangement and solitude. Yet the first yang is bright, bearing the image of the primordial man—its estrangement arises from mutual unawareness. Once aware, their hearts would be mutually trusting. The second and fifth lines are properly responsive; if the fifth yin can employ the second yang, then the marsh’s blessings will cover all under heaven, and the people will all rely on its grace. The ruler should seek the worthy, and only then will the worthy follow—thus the fifth yin must take the initiative. Li Taifa says: Affection turns to estrangement through doubt; only firmness can dispel doubt and bring union. Thus the fourth ultimately meets the primordial man, and the top ultimately meets the rain.\n\nCai Jiefu says: The Dao is the correct Dao. This explains the meaning of the word \"alley.\"\n☶ below ☵ above: *Jian*.\n\nFavorable in the southwest, unfavorable in the northeast; favorable to see the great person, steadfastness brings good fortune.\n\n*The Judgment* says: *Jian* means difficulty, with danger ahead. Seeing danger and being able to stop—how wise! *Jian* is favorable in the southwest because going there attains the center; unfavorable in the northeast because its path is exhausted. Favorable to see the great person because going there brings success. Being in the proper position and steadfast brings good fortune, for it rightly orders the state. The timely application of *Jian* is truly great!\n\n*The Image* says: Water above the mountain—*Jian*. The noble person turns inward to cultivate virtue.\n\n**First Six:** Going brings difficulty; coming brings praise.\n*The Image* says: Going brings difficulty; coming brings praise—it is fitting to wait.\n\n**Six in the Second:** The king’s minister faces repeated difficulties, not for the sake of self.\n*The Image* says: The king’s minister faces repeated difficulties—ultimately without blame.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** Going brings difficulty; coming brings return.\n*The Image* says: Going brings difficulty; coming brings return—inner joy.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** Going brings difficulty; coming brings connection.\n*The Image* says: Going brings difficulty; coming brings connection—being in the proper position is substantial.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** Great difficulty, friends come.\n*The Image* says: Great difficulty, friends come—through central moderation.\n\n**Top Six:** Going brings difficulty; coming brings greatness, good fortune; favorable to see the great person.\n*The Image* says: Going brings difficulty; coming brings greatness—its aspiration is inward. Favorable to see the great person—following the noble.\n\n*Water above Mountain: Jian*\n*Jian* is the image of feet struggling to advance, hence it is called difficulty. The cause of difficulty is the peril of *Kan* ahead. This hexagram combines outer peril with inner stillness, so facing difficulty, one stops—thus it is called *Jian*. Yet seeing peril and being able to stop is called wisdom. However, stopping without going is the power of *Gen*’s stillness. The third line, as the master of *Gen*’s stillness, is especially relied upon. Thus all six lines speak of \"going,\" showing that while coming is possible, going is not. Yet the hexagram repeatedly says \"favorable in the southwest\" and \"favorable to see the great person\"—why does it seem to insist on going? Precisely because seeing peril and being able to stop can be called wisdom in not going, but if one does not also speak of going to see the great person in the fifth *yang* line, how can one attain the good fortune of \"going to attain the center\" and \"going to bring success\"? Thus, while going into peril is certainly inadvisable, is going to attain the center or bring success also inadvisable? The position of the fifth *yang* is in the southwest, the place of central attainment, a peril-free zone where one should stop. Moreover, with *yang* in the fifth, properly positioned and centrally correct, it rightly orders all states and brings peace to all nations—truly one whom the four directions find it favorable to see. Only those lacking wisdom fail to recognize this, mistakenly believing the fifth line remains in peril, unable to escape danger themselves, let alone benefit others. Little do they know that while the world sees peril, the worthy of the second *yang* alone recognize it as a peril-free center. Thus it is called wisdom. Therefore, all six lines speak of \"going brings difficulty; coming brings good fortune,\" with the auspicious phrase reserved for the top line to represent all five, using the outer to reveal the inner—a rhetorical economy. Thus, all going is difficult and inadvisable, while all coming is auspicious—bringing praise, freedom from blame, inner joy, substantial connection, or greatness with good fortune. Only coming is possible; going is not. Yet who knows there is an even greater difficulty, like the fifth line? While ordinary difficulty forbids going, the great difficulty of the fifth line paradoxically invites it. While ordinary difficulty is called wisdom for not going, the great difficulty of the fifth line brings good fortune and harmony precisely by going to join it. Here, going is stopping, and this stopping is true wisdom. The reason lies in the fifth *yang*’s firm centrality and ability to moderate. *Jie* means restraint, steadfast and unmoving. Amid peril, the great person of *Jian* is one whom all lines find it favorable to see—hence \"central moderation.\" Is not the timely application of *Jian* truly great?\n\nThe first line, going nowhere and coming instead, gains praise. Praise comes from knowing when to stop and thus attaining. The second line, bound as the king’s minister, should not go—yet does not go not for self-love, but because minister and ruler share the same difficulty. The second line has pondered this deeply, hence \"ultimately without blame.\" Only the third line, master of *Gen*’s stillness, can come, returning to the fifth, so the two inner lines rejoice in their shared aspiration. The third *yang*, firm and properly positioned, is substantial and great, so the fourth line connects with it, and friends come. The top line’s aspiration is for the third, the great person. With thoughts aligned, seeing the fifth line’s great person becomes effortless.\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Shi’s explanation: Being in the proper position and correct is the fifth line. The fifth line is the great person, thus standing amid peril yet able to rightly order the state. What others avoid—peril—he alone finds secure. This must be one capable of bearing the world’s greatest difficulties.\n\nThe disciples of Xiang said: If it is not peril, it is not *Jian*. Seeing peril and stopping—this is *Jian*.\n\nWang Fusi said: At the beginning of difficulty, in the initial moment of stillness, with unique foresight, seeing peril and stopping—how wise!\n\nXiong Nansha said: \"Going\" refers to *Kan*; \"coming\" refers to *Gen*.\n\nShen Cunzhong said: *Jianjian* means the fifth is difficult, and the second is also difficult. *Shuo* means great, distinguished from \"great difficulty\" by not using \"great.\" Hence \"aspiration is inward,\" clarifying its response to the third line. *The Original Meaning* says coming to the fifth would be redundant with \"seeing the great person.\"\n\nWang Ji said: Ahead lies perilous terrain, behind stand towering barriers—this is the image of *Jian*. The noble person observes the image of *Jian* and turns inward to cultivate virtue. Mencius said: \"When one’s actions yield no success, one should turn inward and seek within oneself.\" Turning inward takes the back of *Gen*; cultivating virtue takes the heart of *Kan*.\n\nZhou Yan said: Turning inward takes *Kan*—the image of water’s difficulty in movement. Cultivating virtue takes *Gen*—the image of the mountain’s constant stillness.\n\n*Kan* below, *Zhen* above.\n\n**Explanation:** Favorable in the southwest. No place to go—its return is auspicious. Where there is somewhere to go, early action brings good fortune.\n\n**The *Tuan* says:** *Xie* is peril set in motion; moving, one escapes peril—this is *Xie*. *Xie* is favorable in the southwest—going forth gains the multitude. Its return is auspicious, for it attains the center. Where there is somewhere to go, early action brings good fortune, for going forth yields merit. Heaven and earth release, and thunder and rain arise; thunder and rain arise, and the hundred fruits, herbs, and trees all split their husks—how great is the timing of *Xie*!\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** Thunder and rain arise—this is *Xie*. The noble person thereby pardons transgressions and forgives sins.\n\n**First Six:** No blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** At the juncture of firm and yielding, there is no blame in principle.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** Hunting, one captures three foxes and obtains a yellow arrow—steadfastness brings good fortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Nine in the Second’s steadfast good fortune lies in attaining the central path.\n\n**Six in the Third:** Bearing a burden while riding in a carriage invites bandits to arrive—steadfastness brings regret.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Bearing a burden while riding in a carriage—how shameful! Bringing armed conflict upon oneself—who else is to blame?\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Releasing the toe, friends arrive and trust is established.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Releasing the toe—this is not the proper position.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** The noble person is bound yet released—auspicious. There is trust in the petty person.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The noble person is released—the petty person retreats.\n\n**Top Six:** The duke shoots a wild goose on the high bank, capturing it—nothing is unfavorable.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The duke shoots the wild goose to resolve perversity.\n\n*Thunder over Water: Xie*\n\nFang Shihua said: When peril remains unresolved, all going forth is *Jian*, and all returning is auspicious—one may return but may not go forth. Once resolved, not only is return auspicious, but one also attains the central position of Nine in the Second and finds stability. Though going forth, early action still brings good fortune, for one thereby achieves the image of resolving peril and merits success. Thus it is said: Favorable in the southwest—going forth gains the multitude. Where there is somewhere to go, early action brings good fortune, for going forth yields merit. Hence both *Jian* and *Xie* speak of being favorable in the southwest. Yet *Jian*’s southwest refers to Nine in the Fifth—the central position amid peril—while *Xie*’s southwest refers to the second, fourth, and top lines—the multitude of positions resolving peril. Thus *Jian* speaks of going forth as if speaking of coming, hence: \"Great *Jian*—friends come to resolve it.\" Speaking of going forth, it focuses solely on going forth, hence: \"No place to go.\" Speaking of going forth, it immediately brings early good fortune. Why is there no good fortune in \"no place to go\"? Above the second, one shoots the fourth—having resolved, one acts. Three make a multitude. Why does the hexagram uniquely place Six in the Third at the extreme of peril, with no correspondence? Precisely because it invites peril. Top Six corresponds with Three yet does not respond—if not shooting and capturing, it must share in the peril. How could it escape the hands of one who remains centered and unmoving? Observing First Six’s lack of blame and Nine in the Fourth’s trust among friends, it is clear that capturing it brings no disadvantage. Thus when Nine in the Fourth moves and emerges from peril, First Six responds, and no blame ensues. When Four moves to release the toe, First Six responds, and trust among friends is established. If one man stirs trouble, those who align with him all suffer its consequences. Once peril is resolved, those who align and those who respond all establish trust—this is both the natural course and the proper principle. Thus it is said: At the juncture of firm and yielding, there is no blame in principle.\n\nYet this hexagram is called *Xie* due to the power of Nine in the Second, who remains centered and unmoving, and whose success depends on employing the right person—namely, the duke who shoots the wild goose, a man who stores his talents and awaits the right moment to act. As for Four, it marks the beginning of movement. When in peril, one cannot act lightly; the moment one moves, one escapes peril. Thus Four releases its toe and acts. Once the toe moves, it does not stop again. Friends arrive, and trust is established—their kind all move in response. Yet Four merely enjoys the outcome and attains resolution; it is not the one who resolves peril in this hexagram. Thus it is said: This is not the proper position.\n\nSix in the Fifth, yielding and centered, sees resolution and acts, then delights in saying: \"The noble person is bound yet released—auspicious,\" implying that once released, good fortune follows without further action. This single thought not only establishes trust among friends but also among petty persons. Thus it is said: There is trust in the petty person. When the noble person is released, petty persons naturally submit and retreat. Once released and having retreated, what more is there to do? Otherwise, if trust is not established at heart, though resolved, it is as if unresolved, and the world’s affairs arise anew. Can one not take warning from the events of the Song? Petty persons initially wish to share caution with the noble person to preserve their wealth and status, rather than oppose them and lose their position. Only when the noble person’s resentment toward petty persons remains unresolved do petty persons constantly fear losing their position and turn to bite back, their poison deepening and becoming irresolvable. Thus the calamity of petty persons ultimately becoming irresolvable is always preceded by the noble person’s failure to resolve. This is the great mechanism of order and chaos throughout the ages, and thus the sage repeatedly emphasizes it here. Six in the Fifth, yielding and centered, occupies the honored position—one who can resolve entanglements. It no longer engages in perilous undertakings. Emperor Wen of Han is an example.\n\n**Appendix**\nLi Dingzuo said: Nine in the Fourth embodies *Zhen*, which is the foot’s toe.\n\nXiong Nansha said: In the *Nine Schools* interpretation, *Kan* represents the fox, and residing in the second position signifies the center. Yellow is the color of the center. Liu Yongxiang said: The second line, with one yang line horizontally interlinked within it, forms the image of the yellow arrow. The Master said: Attaining the central Dao is precisely what \"obtaining the yellow arrow\" means. The *Shangliu* (Six in the Sixth) occupies the top of the hexagram, forming the image of a high embankment.\n\n*Yiyin Xiajing*, Juan One, concludes.\n\n**Textual Notes:**\n1.

Do not decrease it to increase it.\n**The Image** says: Nine Two’s benefit in steadfastness—its will is centered.\n\n**Line 3 (Six Three):** When three people walk, one is decreased; when one person walks, they gain a companion.\n**The Image** says: When one person walks, three cause doubt.\n\n**Line 4 (Six Four):** Decreasing one’s illness brings joy in the aftermath—no blame.\n**The Image** says: Decreasing one’s illness—this too is cause for joy.\n\n**Line 5 (Six Five):** Someone increases it with a tortoise worth ten *peng*—it cannot be refused; supreme fortune.\n**The Image** says: Six Five’s supreme fortune—it is aided from above.\n\n**Line 6 (Top Nine):** Do not decrease it to increase it—no blame; steadfast and fortunate; beneficial to have somewhere to go; gaining ministers and a great household.\n**The Image** says: Do not decrease it to increase it—this greatly fulfills the will.\n\n**Mountain and Marsh: Decrease**\nDecrease and increase are matters of the same moment. In this hexagram, decrease is spoken of first and increase afterward to show that all decrease is for the sake of benefit. If it were not for great benefit, why would one hastily decrease? Only when decrease brings sincerity, supreme fortune, no blame, proper steadfastness, and benefit in having somewhere to go—only when it brings such great benefit—is it truly decrease. Otherwise, why would one decrease? Thus, the question *\"What is it used for?\"* makes its meaning clear. Therefore, without increasing the yielding, decreasing the firm cannot be accomplished; without benefit in offering, decreasing the two vessels cannot be accomplished. Thus, decreasing the firm is for increasing the yielding—if the yielding does not increase the firm, one cannot hastily decrease. Decreasing the two vessels is because they may be used for offering at the proper time. If they are not used for offering, how can the vessels be hastily decreased? Therefore, when the time calls for increase, even heaven and earth, sages and worthies cannot but decrease to achieve their benefit. Only when it comes to increase is decrease no longer spoken of. Thus, in the *Judgment* of *Increase*, decrease is not mentioned; in its lines, decrease is not mentioned; in the *Judgment* and line texts of *Increase*, decrease is not mentioned. Only in the hexagram of *Decrease* is it spoken of—from this, one may know that decrease must bring benefit. And once there is benefit, it is as if no decrease ever occurred. Thus, *Increase* alone does not speak of decrease.\n\nIn the hexagram of *Decrease*, the first line speaks of considerate decrease, the fourth of decreasing illness, the second and top lines both speak of not decreasing to increase, and the third actually decreases the firm to increase the yielding of the top nine. Yet the third regains a companion—though it decreases, it is not truly decreased, but rather benefits. Though it decreases, it brings sincerity, supreme fortune, no blame, proper steadfastness, and benefit in having somewhere to go. Thus, one may say it decreases, or one may say it does not decrease, or one may say it decreases yet benefits. From this, the Dao of decrease can be understood. Therefore, the hexagram of *Decrease* is placed first.\n\nNow observe the three yang lines of *Qian*: when one decreases them to benefit *Kun*, and *Kun*’s lines increase the top nine, it becomes *Gen*; when *Qian*’s lines decrease the three yang, it becomes *Dui*. Six Four, residing below the stillness of *Gen*, newly becomes a neighbor to the joy of *Dui*—its illness is clearly from *Dui*. What brings joy is that Six Four’s affairs are completed by the initial nine, which has long shared a sincere bond. If the initial nine can let go of the past to uphold this shared will, then Four’s illness will naturally decrease. For Four’s illness originally arose from losing harmony, so now, upon regaining harmony, its illness decreases. Thus, the initial nine incurs no blame, and Four also incurs no blame. Therefore, what the initial nine should considerately address is only letting go of the past—there is nothing to decrease. If Six Five were suddenly to increase the yang of the top nine, as if someone increased it with a tortoise worth ten *peng*, which cannot be refused and whose origin is unknown, this would bring supreme fortune. What need is there for the aid of two like-minded ones letting go to benefit it? If Nine Two were to let go, it would bring misfortune in advancing. Thus, it is said: *\"Nine Two’s benefit in steadfastness—its will is centered.\"* This means the sincerity of shared will resides within; it is beneficial to be steadfast and requires no decrease. Then who is it that decreases? Is it not Six Three? Thus, when the three yang decrease one, Six Three becomes the walk of one person—it seems to decrease yet doubts its original companion. However, the upper trigram gains one yang, becoming Six Three’s proper correlate. Thus, though Six Three doubts the decrease, it is in fact sitting and gaining a companion—it too has not truly decreased.\n\nFrom this perspective, the initial line does not decrease, the second does not decrease, and though the third seems to decrease, it has not truly decreased. The top nine, though it greatly receives benefit, is also increased without decrease. Its words—no blame, steadfast and fortunate, beneficial to have somewhere to go, gaining ministers and a great household—all pertain to the top nine receiving benefit and greatly fulfilling its will. The hexagram statement and *Judgment* are entirely consistent. If it regains a companion, how has it truly decreased? The three become the walk of one person—thus, it is also said to gain ministers and a great household. Or one might ask: Why does the initial nine speak of Six Four’s completed affairs? At the beginning of *Tai*’s exchange, *Kun*’s Six Four, though harmonious and aligned, though a neighbor to Nine Three, does not guard its center. Yet it sincerely responds to its proper correlate, the initial nine—thus, it is clear that the initial nine is the one who completed Six Four’s affairs.\n\nNow, when Qian’s Nine Three suddenly diminishes itself to augment the top, reducing nine to form Dui, a single yin arrives to take its place—thus, Six Four loses its position and its harmonious alignment, its former grace now vanished. Is this not the malady of reckless excess? What is to be celebrated, however, is that the initial Nine does not forget its shared aspiration to ascend, and with serene resolve, it advances to console Six Four. Once Six Four again beholds the one who had completed its affairs, its affliction naturally lessens, and the one who was sent forth brings joy—this is only fitting.\n\nThus, in *Sun* (Diminishing), the initial Nine is indeed the one who completed Six Four’s affairs, while in *Yi* (Augmenting), the initial Nine is no longer the same, for it dares not overburden those below. As the timely transformation states: “Diminishing below to augment above—its Dao moves upward.” This refers to the lower trigram’s single yang now ascending, so that the Dao advances above, diminishing yet holding true. How could this not be supremely auspicious, blameless, correct, and beneficial for progress?\n\nTherefore, the *Commentary* retains these words precisely to show that diminishing brings benefit. **Appendix:** Lu Bolai says: “Offerings require the full array of vessels; the use of two sacrificial stands is fitting only in the time of *Sun*, not as a constant practice.” For hardness and softness are the great divisions of the world. Diminishing the hard to augment the soft is fitting only at certain times. Diminishing and augmenting, fullness and emptiness—these move in accord with the times. The transformations of Heaven and Earth: when excess is diminished, insufficiency is augmented; when loss occurs, gain follows. If Heaven and Earth had intent, it would be only to move in step with the times.\n\nThe various masters say: In the rites of offering, displaying achievements with eight sacrificial stands is abundant, four is moderate, and two is meager. Xiong Nansha says: The formation of the *Sun* hexagram lies in the third line, where the top two lines form Dui with two yang. Cai Qing says: Two cowries make a *peng*. In antiquity, cowries served as currency, and a *peng* was worth two hundred sixteen. Wang Ji says: “Curb anger as if toppling a mountain; stifle desire as if sealing a hole.”\n\n☴☳ *Yi* (Augmenting): Beneficial to have somewhere to go; beneficial to ford the great river.\n**Judgment:** *Yi* means diminishing above to augment below, so the people rejoice without limit. When the superior descends to those below, its Dao shines greatly. Beneficial to have somewhere to go—central correctness brings good fortune. Beneficial to ford the great river—the Dao of wood proceeds. *Yi* moves and yields, advancing without limit. Heaven bestows, Earth produces—its augmentation is boundless. The Dao of all augmentation moves in accord with the times.\n**Image:** Wind and thunder—*Yi*. The noble person, seeing goodness, emulates it; having faults, corrects them.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n- **Initial Nine:** Beneficial to undertake great works; supremely auspicious, no blame.\n  **Image:** Supremely auspicious, no blame—those below do not overburden themselves.\n- **Six Two:** Someone augments it with a tortoise worth ten *peng*, which cannot be refused. Eternally correct, auspicious. The king uses it to offer to the Supreme, auspicious.\n  **Image:** Someone augments it—this comes from without.\n- **Six Three:** Augmenting is used for inauspicious affairs, no blame. Holding true to the central path, it announces to the duke with a jade tablet.\n  **Image:** Augmenting is used for inauspicious affairs—this is inherently so.\n- **Six Four:** On the central path, it announces to the duke, who follows. Beneficial to rely upon for relocating the state.\n  **Image:** The duke follows its announcement—to augment its aspiration.\n- **Nine Five:** Holding true with a generous heart—do not ask, supremely auspicious. Holding true, it graciously bestows virtue upon me.\n  **Image:** Holding true with a generous heart—do not ask. Graciously bestowing virtue upon me—greatly fulfilling its will.\n- **Top Nine:** No one augments it; someone strikes it. Establishing the heart without constancy—misfortune.\n  **Image:** No one augments it—this is partial speech. Someone strikes it—this comes from without.\n\n**Wind and Thunder: Yi**\nDiminishing Qian’s Nine Four’s single yang to augment the lower trigram’s initial Nine is augmenting below—this is the affair of the lord alone. Only Nine Five’s generous heart can truly hold fast. Thus, there is the good fortune of eternal correctness. It truly receives the treasure yet does not know whence the augmentation comes. With the good fortune of offering to the Supreme, it shares in the blessing and together with Five fulfills Heaven’s will—this is how the second line receives augmentation. But is it only the second? The third also holds true to Five’s ability to augment below. The second occupies the center, and the third likewise participates, thus both are called “central path.” The second offers to the Supreme, and the third likewise participates, thus it may announce to the duke with a jade tablet.\n\nNow, when Nine Five alone augments below, all below trust it and truly receive its benefit. How could such sincerity and generosity not be evident? Moreover, this initial Nine is precisely the one beneficial for great undertakings, when thunder moves and wind spreads. With yang virtue so manifest, with such stirring power—how could the lower trigram now resemble the former *Kun*, thick and reluctant to act on its own? Its supreme auspiciousness and blamelessness are beyond doubt.\n\nYet when the lower trigram’s three yin lines suddenly gain a yang to reside in the second, the initial line naturally takes on the image of “someone augmenting it with a tortoise worth ten *peng*.” Only the second, gaining yang, is worth ten *peng*, so the third, losing yang, faces inauspicious affairs. For the third and fourth lines are neighbors, and Six Three’s possession of Nine Four was long established. Though now augmented by the initial Nine’s auspiciousness, it cannot avoid losing Nine Four’s inauspiciousness. Is this not “augmenting used for inauspicious affairs”? Yet while the third suffers loss in the outer trigram, it ultimately gains in the inner trigram. Thunder shares the same body. With yang arriving to reside in the initial line, yang Nine is ultimately Six Three’s inherent possession. Thus it is said: “Augmenting used for inauspicious affairs is inherently so.” This means it has not truly suffered loss, so it is not inauspicious.\n\nSix Four may also be called “central path,” for Five occupies the center to augment below, and Four likewise aspires to augment below, aligning with the center in its conduct. Thus, the duke follows its announcement and may come to rely upon the state relocated by the initial Nine. Therefore, it is said: “Beneficial to rely upon for relocating the state.” Though Six Four is yin and soft, it truly augments its aspiration by following Five’s augmentation of those below—this is what it means to hold true with a generous heart.\n\nThe initial yang, being the yang that benefits those below, is already supremely auspicious—how much more so when the noble Five alone diminishes above to augment it? Its supreme auspiciousness need not even be questioned. Thus, those who truly receive its benefit ought to hold faith in its virtuous power. The aspiration to benefit those below reaches its utmost fulfillment here.\n\nAs for the upper Nine, though it possesses the sincerity of a generous heart, it seeks a response to its virtuous power. Thus, with a mind not merely passive but actively seeking the resonance of trust, its words are not one-sided. Hence it is said: “None align with it, and thus harm befalls it.” Without virtuous power, there is only the threat of attack. The retribution of cause and effect is manifest and inescapable. Those who govern must ever reflect on the generous heart that takes benefiting those below as its aspiration.\n\n“Diminishing above to augment below brings boundless joy to the people”—this refers to the two lines Six Two and Six Three. Regarding Six Two, it may receive the augmentation of a ten-stringed tortoise-shell oracle; regarding Six Three, it employs augmentation for inauspicious affairs. Thus, from above to below, the Dao shines brightly—this speaks solely of the initial Nine’s supreme auspiciousness and absence of blame. The phrases “beneficial to have somewhere to go” refer jointly to the initial Nine and Six Four. The former is beneficial for great undertakings, while the latter is beneficial for reliance. The relocation of the state is how Nine Five’s aspiration to benefit those below attains its full realization. Hence it is said: “Central and correct, there is cause for celebration.” The phrases “beneficial to ford the great river” refer solely to Six Four as the master of compliance. As the *Xiang* says, “Announcing to the duke and gaining his compliance fulfills its aspiration.” Thus it is said: “The Dao of wood proceeds.”\n\nThe statement “Augmentation moves in compliance; heaven bestows, earth produces” encompasses the entire hexagram, clarifying that the Dao of augmentation invariably advances in accord with the times.\n\nWang’s *He* says: “Three and Two both receive augmentation from above and are able to announce to the duke and employ the jade tablet, so Three is also called ‘central path,’ meaning it aligns its conduct with Two’s centrality. Four and Five both take benefiting those below as their aspiration and are able to announce to the duke and gain his compliance in relocation, so Four is also called ‘central path,’ meaning it aligns its conduct with Five’s centrality. Thus, those below who truly receive its benefit—Nine One’s great achievements—who would know that what the above bestows is not merely its resources but its capacity to benefit those below? Six Four’s merit in relocating the state—who would know that the above’s generous heart values not merely the person but the aspiration? Only when the aspiration is great does the person become great. Only when there are great persons does the aspiration attain great fulfillment. The noble person may thus discern where augmentation lies.”\n\n**Appendix**\nCheng Zhengshu says: “Announcing to the duke and gaining his compliance is achieved by announcing the aspiration to benefit those below. If the aspiration truly lies in benefiting those below, the above will surely trust and comply.”\n\n---\n\n**Guai (Decisiveness)**\n*Below Qian (Heaven), above Dui (Lake)*\n**Guai:** “Raising the matter in the royal court, trust in outcry, there is danger. Announcing from one’s domain, it is not beneficial to mobilize troops; it is beneficial to have somewhere to go.”\n\n**The *Tuan* says:** *Guai* means to decide, to have the firm decide the yielding. Vigorous yet joyful, resolute yet harmonious, raising the matter in the royal court—this is the yielding riding atop five firm lines. “Trust in outcry, there is danger”—its peril becomes its radiance. “Announcing from one’s domain, it is not beneficial to mobilize troops”—what it esteems reaches its limit. “Beneficial to have somewhere to go”—the growth of the firm will ultimately prevail.\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** The lake rises above heaven—this is *Guai*. The noble person thereby bestows emoluments upon those below and avoids complacency in virtue.\n\n**Nine One:** “Strength in the forward toes; going forth without victory brings blame.”\n**The *Xiang* says:** Going forth without victory—this is blame.\n\n**Nine Two:** “Alarmed outcry; in the night there are troops—do not worry.”\n**The *Xiang* says:** “In the night there are troops—do not worry”—this is attaining the central Dao.\n\n**Nine Three:** “Strength in the cheeks—there is misfortune. The noble person is resolute and forthright. Walking alone, he encounters rain; as if drenched, he is displeased—yet there is no blame.”\n**The *Xiang* says:** “The noble person is resolute and forthright”—in the end, there is no blame.\n\n**Nine Four:** “The buttocks lack flesh; its movement is halting. Leading a ram, regret vanishes—but hearing words, it does not trust.”\n**The *Xiang* says:** “Its movement is halting”—its position is not appropriate. “Hearing words, it does not trust”—its hearing is not enlightened.\n\n**Nine Five:** “The *xianlu* plant is resolute and forthright; the central path brings no blame.”\n**The *Xiang* says:** “The central path brings no blame”—the center has not yet radiated.\n\n**Upper Six:** “Excessive outcry—ultimately there is misfortune.”\n**The *Xiang* says:** “Excessive outcry brings misfortune”—it cannot endure for long.\n\n**Lake over Heaven: *Guai***\nFive yang lines decisively act below, while one yin line compliantly listens above—this is *Guai*. It speaks of the yielding and soft being unable to decide, relying on the five yang to resolve it, hence it is called *guai* (decisiveness). But how do we know it can resolve? Because this hexagram is vigorous yet able to be joyful. Thus, resolute yet able to harmonize: joyfulness gives rise to the aspiration for resonance, and its vigor can be enacted; harmony gives rise to the sincerity of the lake’s joy, and its resolution can penetrate.\n\nThe single yin above desires to resolve but cannot, while the five yang below cannot but resolve. For the five yang, this is truly difficult. With one yielding riding atop five firm lines, the five yang advance together and raise the matter in the royal court—this is the height of flourishing. “Trust in outcry, there is danger”—this refers to the correspondence between Upper Six and Nine Three. Dui is the mouth; Upper Six occupies the mouth’s position, having a mouth yet crying excessively—its yielding weakness is evident. If it were to cry out, it would surely do so first, prompting Nine Three to walk resolutely and forthrightly alone to meet it. How could Three fear the displeasure of the many yang? Yet it would bring peril and danger upon Upper Six. Why? If Upper Six could cry out to Three, Three would surely respond. Precisely its danger is what makes it radiant—this is the Dao of the ruler. Hence it is said: “Trust in outcry, there is danger; its peril becomes its radiance.” Alas, though it has a mouth and cries excessively, even if it sought peril, it could not attain it. Excessive outcry ultimately brings misfortune—how could it be merely peril and danger?\n\nIts end cannot be prolonged—how could it be merely blame? From Nine Three’s case, one sees clearly that the five yang lines reveal Upper Six’s inadequacy for action. Thus, the Second, situated amidst the many yang, deems itself unfit for responsibility—why should it fear the warfare of dusk and night? The warfare of dusk and night is the theft of twilight. Yet since there is a master, the Second rests content in the center below. Though dusk and night bring warfare, it remains untroubled, vigilant only lest Upper Six’s outcry bring peril upon itself. Therefore, the sage praises its attainment of the central Dao. How could it resemble the reckless advance of the initial yang, unaware that its going cannot prevail and will only incur blame? That Nine Five is precisely the foremost figure extolled in the royal court—one who acts with centrality and incurs no blame, resolutely attending to affairs above, like Zhuge Liang or Jiang Wan. Even Zhuge Liang was hard to come by. Yet now, observing Nine Five’s centrality, which lacks radiance, one sees it falls far short of Zhuge Liang’s stature. Thus, Upper Six persists until the rigid and prolonged ultimately end—like Emperor Xian of Han meeting Cao Pi. One then understands that weak yin is difficult to support: even with the abilities of Yi Yin or the Duke of Zhou, *Guai* still requires the abilities of Tai Jia or King Cheng. The trustful outcry is the constant Dao of the noble person. I have indeed been moved by this resolute forthrightness.\n\nIt is said: “Announce within your own domain; it is not advantageous to resort to arms.” This speaks of the time when the five yang have gained ground and the earthly domain of *Kun* is nearly exhausted. One can only issue commands within one’s domain—who would raise arms? What is esteemed has reached its limit; even with five yang, what can be done? Yet it remains advantageous to have somewhere to go, for the five yang are all noble persons, not yet plotting usurpation. They merely await its natural end. Thus, the sage again clarifies the Dao of *Guai*’s decisive action in the six lines.\n\nThe First Nine, “vigorous in the forward toe,” incurs blame for going without prevailing—this is an excess of decisiveness, which must not be. The Second Nine, “untroubled,” knows the time and dares not act decisively—this is one who attains the center. The Third Nine, doubly rigid and vigorous, its decisiveness evident in its countenance, bears the image of vigor, yet in compliance. If vigor in the toe still brings blame, how much more perilous is vigor in compliance? Yet this Third, treading *Qian* while embracing *Dui*, stands precisely at the time of robust strength. Thus, the many yang respond to it, resenting or approving, and when it alone meets them, the two seem moistened—its yin and yang harmonious and moist, its vigor and joy following one another. Though resolute, it is not excessive—this is the noble person’s decisive action. Alas, Upper Six does not know to seek its alliance! Hence it is said: “The noble person decisively decisive.”\n\nAs for the Fourth, it is not that it does not wish to act decisively, but being yang in a yin position, it bears the image of excess and hesitation, unable to advance. Following the sheep from behind, it may perhaps avoid the regret of being led. Yet since it is not central or correct, it lacks clarity. Its following the sheep from behind, hindered by hesitation, is not due to hearing and believing, nor does it thereby avoid the regret of being led. Only Nine Five, closely approaching Upper Six with solitary yin above, can last but a short while. This is like tender amaranth treading upon hard ground—how could it not be resolute? Yet at this time, resolute though it may be, I know Nine Five cannot achieve greatness in central radiance. How difficult is Nine Three’s position! Nine Three, in correspondence, still shares the state’s concerns. Nine Five, bearing Upper Six, harbors the intent to await its inauspicious end. Alas, few ministers at such a juncture would not salivate. I hold that Yi Yin, the Duke of Zhou, and Lord Zhuge—these three great sages—are worthy of reverence.\n\n**Appendix**\nXiong Nansha says: *Kun* is the domain.\n\nWhen the five yin lines all transform, leaving only Upper Six, the domain of the land is diminished.\n\nFan Daxing says: Warfare requires multitudes. When *Kun* transforms to the fifth line, it nears the extremity of the multitude, hence \"not advantageous to engage in warfare.\"\n\nDing Yidong says: Four yang lines constitute \"strength,\" five yang lines constitute \"resoluteness.\" The initial line of *Great Strength* is called \"strength of the toe,\" thus it is distinguished by adding \"resolute\" to the preceding \"strength.\"\n\nZhai Xuan says: Before the head of *Qian* lies compliance.\n\n\"Solitary action\" refers to all lines being without correspondence, while only the third line corresponds with the uppermost, hence \"solitary.\"\n\nUpper Six is the master of *Completion of Joy*. Moreover, it ascends to the marsh of heaven, thus \"encountering rain.\"\n\nLi Tuweng says: The sage’s profound care for the Dao of yang is most earnest, hence the utmost warnings to those of yang firmness. From the first stirring of a single yang in *Return*, it is said: \"The day closes the gates, merchants and travelers do not proceed, the lord does not inspect the regions\"—all for protection and nurturance, lest it be harmed. The sage’s heart is thus revealed. When two yang lines show signs of gradual growth, the sage rejoices in their approach to the four yin, yet immediately says: \"As for the eighth month, there will be misfortune.\" While it is growing, he already considers its decline—this is not true haste in its dissipation. Only because he rejoices in its growth does he immediately contemplate its decline. Here again, the sage’s desire for its growth is most evident. When three yang lines form *Peace*, the flourishing of *Peace*’s exchange has been esteemed since antiquity—this goes without saying. At four yang lines, it becomes *Great Strength*. Yet while yang delights in strength, it utterly disdains the *use* of strength. For to use strength is the affair of petty men; the noble man dares not act thus. Hence it is said: \"The petty man uses strength; the noble man does not.\" If a noble man were to use strength, he would be but a ram—entangling his horns in the hedge, what gain is there in strength? If the strength of four yang lines is cautioned against so earnestly, how could the resoluteness of five yang lines be taken lightly? In all these five hexagrams, the sage’s deep love for yang is manifest. Those who possess the virtue of yang firmness should take care not to lightly employ their firmness, but rather strive to deeply embody the sage’s intent.\n\nBelow *Xun*, above *Qian*: *Gou* (*Encounter*). \"The woman is strong; do not take this woman.\"\n\nThe *Tuan* says: *Gou* means encounter—softness encounters firmness. \"Do not take this woman,\" for she cannot be partnered for long. When heaven and earth encounter, the beings of all things become manifest. When firmness encounters central correctness, great undertakings proceed throughout the world. The significance of *Gou*’s time is vast indeed!\n\nThe *Image* says: Wind beneath heaven—*Gou*. The lord thereby issues commands and proclaims to the four directions.\n\n**First Six:** Bound to a metal *ni*, steadfastness brings good fortune. To have somewhere to go—seeing misfortune, the emaciated pig struggles and hesitates.\nThe *Image* says: \"Bound to a metal *ni*,\" for the soft way is restrained.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** Enveloping the fish—no blame. Not advantageous for guests.\nThe *Image* says: \"Enveloping the fish\"—rightness does not extend to guests.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** The buttocks lack skin; its movement is halting and difficult. Danger—no great blame.\nThe *Image* says: \"Its movement is halting and difficult\"—its progress is not yet restrained.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Enveloping no fish—arising misfortune.\nThe *Image* says: \"Misfortune of no fish\"—distancing the people.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** With *qi* to envelop the melon, containing radiance—there is a falling from heaven.\nThe *Image* says: \"Nine in the Fifth containing radiance\"—central correctness. \"There is a falling from heaven\"—the will does not abandon the mandate.\n\n**Upper Nine:** Encountering its horns—regret, no blame.\nThe *Image* says: \"Encountering its horns\"—exhaustion above brings regret.\n\n**Heaven and Wind: Gou**—*Gou* means encounter. This hexagram, originally all yang, has a single yin beginning below, thus it is called \"encounter\"—softness encounters firmness, earth encounters heaven, the first six, a single yin, encounters five yang. When one soft and one firm encounter, they naturally form a pair; when above is heaven and below is earth, they naturally manifest all things. But here, a single yin encounters five yang—this woman is moreover strong—what is to be done? The sage says: *Xun* is the eldest daughter. The woman is already strong—do not take this woman. For if one does not take this woman, she cannot be partnered for long. Hence it is said: \"Do not take this woman, for she cannot be partnered for long.\"\n\nJin Shuxiang’s mother said: \"In deep mountains and great marshes, dragons and serpents are truly born. That beauty—I fear she will bear dragons and serpents to bring calamity to you.\" If so, is this woman not one who truly gives birth to dragons and serpents, bringing disaster to your state and misfortune to your house? That she cannot be taken is abundantly clear. Fortunately, there is the firmness of Nine in the Second—this woman encounters it like encountering a metal *ni*. Yet once encountered, she is bound and stopped, resolutely prevented from going further. The pig, the fish, and the melon are all yin things, all referring to the first line. Thus, at the first line, it is called the \"emaciated pig.\" \"Emaciated\" is like the \"emaciated horns\" entangled in the hedge—struggling and emaciated, desiring to go somewhere but not accepting restraint. How could it know that to have somewhere to go is to see misfortune, and that it must not be allowed to go anywhere? This is why being bound to the metal *ni* is steadfast and auspicious. Thus, at the second line, it again speaks of \"enveloping the fish.\" A fish must have water to live—how could enveloping it allow it to live? Yet Nine in the Second must envelop it to avoid blame. The fish is not advantageous for guests, hence rightness does not allow this fish to reach guests. Thus, it is better to envelop and confine it than to pass on misfortune. But how to account for Nine in the Fourth’s desire to \"arise misfortune\"? \"No fish\" means no misfortune. Yet Nine in the Fourth, taking itself as the guest of the first line, desires to \"arise misfortune\"—what can Nine in the Second do? Moreover, Nine in the Fourth occupies a position near the ruler, holding to the doctrine of proper correspondence. \"No fish\" gives rise to misfortune, distancing the people and provoking disputes. Though Nine in the Second is a metal *ni*, I fear it will ultimately be unable to restrain it. Thus, the reason Nine in the Fourth ultimately does not \"arise misfortune\"—is it not entirely due to the central correctness of Nine in the Fifth?\n\nThus, at the Fifth Line, it speaks of \"enveloping the melon.\" Now, the melon is inherently a perishable thing; when enveloped, it perishes all the more readily. Yet Nine in the Fifth, being central and correct, uniquely embraces the splendid virtue of Nine in the Second, trusting in its central constancy. It then employs Nine in the Second’s *qi* to envelop the melon of Initial Six. Since the melon has already fallen from heaven, Nine in the Fourth is thus able to petition heaven and avoid arising misfortune—how profoundly auspicious! Heaven is *Qian*, the Fifth. Nine in the Second, by this means, preserves its firm righteousness; Nine in the Third, by this means, avoids being entangled in action; and the Top Line, by this means, though exhausted, encounters no misfortune and so remains free of blame. From this, we know that Nine in the Fifth’s resolve truly cannot contain the mandate of its kindred line to such an extent. Alas! When a ruler of central correctness and a minister of firm centrality meet and form a splendid union, it reaches this degree. Then is there anything under heaven that cannot be accomplished? Thus it is said: \"When the firm encounters the central and correct, great undertakings prevail throughout the world.\" The timeliness of *Sheng* is indeed momentous!\n\nNine in the Third, situated below *Qian* in the symbol of the buttocks, with *Xun* representing hesitation and indecision, and dwelling above *Xun* in the position of \"next and nearly,\" its symbol being \"next and nearly,\" thus its actions are not yet entangled with Initial Six and so it avoids great blame. Otherwise, how could danger be averted?\n\nHerein lies a difficulty: when the first *yin* arises, it is *Gou*; when the second *yin* gradually grows, it becomes *Dun*. *Dun* does not mean \"to flee\" but \"to restrain.\" Since the world cannot tolerate the primal *yin*, the firm and yang must not be idle. In *Dun*, though one spends the whole day amid filth, it is of no consequence. For the firm and yang are often intolerant, thus at the time when *yin* gradually grows, they are immediately restrained by *Dun*. Though *Dun* does not preclude encounter, even when encounter occurs, it is in truth *Dun*.\n\nWhen three *yin* lines form *Pi*, if three *yin* reside below, it is still *Pi*; yet when four *yin* reside below, it becomes *Guan*—why is this? For when two yang reside above and four *yin* below, the superior remains unmoved in countenance and naturally becomes the world’s spectacle—what then of two *yin* or three *yin*? Thus, when the sage is above and *yin* and *yang* harmonize, the world attains peace through this.\n\nYet the world’s particular concern is the absence of those who embody great observation. If there is truly great observation, one yang suffices—why wait for two? Those who advocate delay do so precisely because of the lack of great observation.\n\nWhen five *yin* lines erode and form *Bo*, one brings ruin upon oneself, losing all shelter. Thus, the sage deeply considers the multitude of *yin*, saying: one must repair one’s hut to take refuge and bear the ruler upon a carriage. For is not the great fruit here? Who would dare consume it? The sage’s guidance to humanity regarding the interplay of *yin* and *yang* is profound, and his strategies for *yang* are exhaustive. Readers should ponder this carefully.\n\n**Appendix**\n\nXiong Nansha said: *Dizhu* (踯躅) follows Li Maoqin’s interpretation as \"moving with halting steps,\" referring to the act of walking. Walking involves two feet—one step, one pause. *Xun* (巽) represents the thighs, signifying advance; to retreat the thigh is to advance is to *dizhu*. Zhen Yu believed it denoted something lofty, great, firm, and solid. Yu Bao said: the first and second lines form *Xun*, representing grasses and trees.\n\n**Below Kun, above Dui: Cui (萃): Smoothness.**\nThe king approaches the ancestral temple. It is beneficial to meet the great person; smoothness and correctness are advantageous. Offering great sacrifices is auspicious; it is beneficial to have somewhere to go.\n\n**The *Tuan* says:** *Cui* means\n\nFirmly knowing that at Nine in the Fifth, one cannot avoid the vulgarity of *cui* in a position of power, nor the failure to demonstrate enduring constancy, nor the dimming of unfulfilled radiance. This is because one fears that the people of Initial Six may yet stir disorder to the end, hence the sigh of lament and the doubt of untrustworthiness. Such are the considerations by which the sage plans for the Fifth. It also reveals that one who would be ruler cannot but be upright, cannot but be great. *Yuan* (元) is greatness; *zhen* (贞) is uprightness. Thus enduring without cease. If, like Nine in the Fifth of *Bi* (比), one divines *yuan*, enduring constancy, and naturally becomes the one whom the five yin lines cherish and assist, then one may dispel regret and cause those who lack trust to trust, those who *cui* in positions of power to *cui* in virtue. This hexagram resembles *Bi*, so the sage uniquely considers *cui* at Nine in the Fifth, reiterating that only with the virtue of *yuan* and enduring constancy can regret be dispelled. Otherwise, *cui* will ultimately fall into chaos—how could regret be dispelled? As for Initial, Third, and Top, merely by advancing to *cui*, all avoid misfortune. As for Second and Fourth, not only do they avoid misfortune, but they also attain great fortune. How magnanimous are the sage’s plans for the people! There is no other reason. Constancy governs encounters with difficulty; the aspiration for radiance and greatness is hard to attain. To comprehend the sentiments of heaven, earth, and the myriad things is not something one meets in a single day or night. Second and Fourth understand this, so they can only draw each other to *cui*, not yet daring to demand perfection. If one must wait for a ruler like Yao or Shun before *cui*, then the scholar who would act upon his aspirations would never find the time. How could one not be magnanimous? Fourth and Fifth are both yang, but Nine in the Fifth holds position and is the one whom the multitude *cui*. Fourth does not occupy the position of Nine in the Fifth, yet turns to *cui* with Five—this is their difference. Alas! Fourth *cui* with Fifth and attains great fortune, yet what more is needed for Fifth, who is *cui* itself? This is the essence of *cui* in this hexagram.\n\nFang Shihua said: All *cui* gathers in one person. Nine in the Fifth occupies this position, and the first to *cui* in close alignment are the four yang lines of shared virtue. Thus, Nine in the Fourth alone is called \"great fortune,\" \"no misfortune,\" for Fourth possesses the substance to gather all under heaven, though it does not occupy the position. Nine in the Fifth rightfully holds the position, hence it is called \"*cui* in a position of power.\" Yet to speak only of position is to lack radiance. If not for the position, it would not suffice to *cui*. Wang Benhe said: Water clings to earth in *Bi*, establishing the myriad states and befriending the feudal lords—this is how one befriends. Through friendship, one compares; through comparison, friendship deepens. Who would say the sage’s comparison is not all-encompassing? Marsh gathers upon earth in *Cui*. Removing weapons of war and guarding against the unforeseen—this is how one secures *cui*. Through security, one gathers; through gathering, one reflects on security. Who would say the sage dares to forget peril? Alas, how perfect! Those who possess the world may reflect upon the origins of *bi* and *cui*.\n\n**Appendix**\nLiu Junbo said: *Zhai* (斋) and *zi* (咨) are sounds of *Dui* (兑), resembling tears flowing. *Dui* is the image of a marsh. Wang Ji said: Water gathers without restraint and bursts its banks; the multitude gathers without discipline and falls into chaos. *Chu* (除) means to cultivate and govern, removing evil and decay. Heaven generates the five materials, and the people discard none of them—who can abolish weapons? To abolish weapons is to invite chaos. The noble one removes weapons of war only to guard against the unforeseen—this is the meaning of \"securing without forgetting peril.\"\n\n**Below Xun, above Kun: Sheng (升): Great prosperity.**\nUseful for meeting the great person; do not worry. A southern campaign is auspicious.\n\n**The *Tuan* says:** The yielding ascends in due time; it is compliant and obedient. The firm is central and responsive—thus great prosperity. Useful for meeting the great person; do not worry, for there will be celebration. A southern campaign is auspicious, for the aspiration is fulfilled.\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** Within the earth, wood grows—this is *Sheng*. The noble one, in accordance with virtue, accumulates the small to become lofty and great.\n\n**Initial Six:** Trustworthy ascent; great fortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Trustworthy ascent; great fortune, for it aligns with the will above.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** Sincerity makes the offering of *yu* (擒) beneficial; no misfortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The sincerity of Nine in the Second brings joy.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** Ascending an empty city.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Ascending an empty city—there is no cause for doubt.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** The king offers sacrifice at Mount Qi; auspicious, no misfortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The king offers sacrifice at Mount Qi—this is obedience to duty.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Constancy is auspicious; ascending the steps.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Constancy is auspicious; ascending the steps—greatly fulfilling the aspiration.\n\n**Top Six:** Dark ascent; beneficial for unceasing constancy.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Dark ascent at the top—diminishing, not enriching.\n\n**Earth-Wind Sheng**\nFang Shihua said: When wood ascends, its initial substance is most yielding and fragile, yet it can rise from the earth to pierce the heavens. Even the hardest cannot do so in its obscurity, for it does not know that it is ascending. If it knew it was ascending, it could not ascend, and even if it did, it would not endure. Thus it is said: \"The yielding ascends in due time.\" How could this not be greatly prosperous? The hexagram’s image is obedient and compliant; the line images are firm, central, and responsive—this is the substance of great prosperity. Six in the Fifth is the great person of the hexagram. Second, with the virtue of firm centrality, responds to Five, so Second uses this to ascend and meet the great person. Having met the great person, what aspiration cannot be fulfilled? Why worry that others will not share in the celebration? Wood flourishes in summer, the season of the southern direction. To advance southward and meet the great person is to fulfill one’s aspiration among the people, bringing great celebration and prosperity—is this not fitting? The celebration is the joy of Second; the fulfillment of aspiration is the great satisfaction of Fifth. Each line ascends in due time, and none is inauspicious. Thus, in other hexagrams, extremes inevitably reverse, but in *Sheng*, there is no such reversal.\n\nAlone in this, it is precisely so.\n\nAt the outset, yielding below, it aligns its aspiration with the Fourth, thus justly ascending with great fortune—just as when firm centrality responds, it gains the favor of filial offering. This is why it is trustworthy, advantageous for selection and offering.\n\nWood emerges from the earth, fundamentally free of obstruction. This is why it ascends: the empty city and the virtue of compliance reside within, and when affairs are undertaken in due time, it ascends to the midst of heaven.\n\nThis is why it is favored: announcing enthronement at Mount Qi, with the great compliance of Six in the Fifth dwelling centrally—this is the time of the level steps of peace. Thus it is said: \"Correct and auspicious.\" Ascending the steps, one assumes the imperial throne and becomes the Son of Heaven.\n\nAt the topmost Six, ascent is obscured; being above, its ascent is unseen, ceaseless yet without visible constancy. Alas, it has reached the utmost! In its ascent, it pierces the clouds and parts the mist—how could the wood know this? For yin is insubstantial and not abundant, ever accustomed to deeming insufficiency as regret. Yet today’s ascent, though it reaches the heavens, remains self-unaware—this may be called dispelling the mind of insufficiency.\n\nThus, those who excel in ascent are like the wood’s suppleness: emerging from the earth, ascending in due time to become beams and ridgepoles, so that others rely on its blessing alone. Utterly unaware of rising from earth to heaven, its aspiration is fully realized, and all benefit from its presence. Compliant and yielding, it neither displays itself to things nor rejoices, nor contends with the times. Though one might wish otherwise, how could it fail to be greatly auspicious and free of blame?\n\n---\n\n**Appendix**\nZheng Kangcheng said: \"The earth is *kun*, the wood is *xun*; wood grows within the earth, daily lengthening and rising upward.\"\n\nMaster Xiang said: \"*Cui* has firm centrality above, so its multitude must gather and ascend. Firm centrality below ensures its ascent.\"\n\nXu of Jinzhai said: \"In *Jin*, the three yielding lines below share aspiration with the Fifth, so Six in the Third speaks of 'the multitude’s trust' and explains it as 'aspiration ascending.' The single yielding line below aligns with the Fourth, so the Initial Six speaks of 'just ascent' and explains it as 'aligning aspiration above.'\"\n\nWang Ji said: \"Wood grows within the earth, lengthening and ascending—this is the image of *Sheng*. Following its natural principle without imposing private intent is called *shun*. Complying with the wood’s growth, from the tiniest sprout to towering height, none see the limit of its ascent, for it achieves this through gradual accumulation. This is the meaning of 'journeying far from near' and 'ascending high from low.' The virtue of compliance is the image of the earth; accumulating small to reach great is the image of yielding wood.\"\n\n---\n\n**Kan below, Dui above**\n*Kun*: Prospering, correct; the great person is auspicious, without blame. Words are not trusted.\n\n**The Judgment** says: *Kun* is the capture of the firm. Perilous yet joyful, in distress yet not losing its prosperity—is this not the noble one? Correct, the great person is auspicious, for it is firm and central. Words are not trusted, for valuing speech leads to exhaustion.\n\n**The Image** says: The marsh lacks water—*Kun*. The noble one devotes his life to fulfilling his aspiration.\n\n**Initial Six**: The buttocks are distressed by a withered tree, entering a dark valley, three years without hunger.\n**The Image** says: Entering a dark valley—darkness obscures clarity.\n\n**Nine in the Second**: Distressed by wine and food, the crimson knee-cover arrives; advantageous for offering and sacrifice. Advancing is ominous, without blame.\n**The Image** says: Distressed by wine and food—there is blessing within.\n\n**Six in the Third**: Distressed by stone, clinging to thorny brambles; entering his chamber, he does not see his wife—ominous.\n**The Image** says: Clinging to thorny brambles—riding the firm. Entering his chamber, not seeing his wife—this is inauspicious.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth**: Coming slowly, distressed by the metal chariot—regret, but with an end.\n**The Image** says: Coming slowly—his aspiration lies below. Though not in its proper place, he has support.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth**: The nose and feet are cut off, distressed by the crimson knee-cover; then slowly there is release. Advantageous for offering and sacrifice.\n**The Image** says: The nose and feet cut off—his aspiration is unfulfilled. Then slowly there is release, for he is central and upright. Advantageous for offering and sacrifice—receiving blessing.\n\n**Topmost Six**: Distressed by creeping vines and brittle twigs; saying, \"Move and repent,\" there is repentance—advancing is auspicious.\n**The Image** says: Distressed by creeping vines—not in its proper place. \"Move and repent,\" there is repentance—advancing is auspicious.\n\n---\n\nThe marsh’s water *Kun*: The firm *kan* is overlaid by the yielding *dui*, so the noble one is obscured by flattering, deceptive petty men, and the yang firmness is subdued by the craft of the perverse. Thus *Kun* is evident.\n\nYet the Fifth dwells in the body of joy, slowly finding release and preserving its central uprightness—this is peril below and joy above. Though distressed, it does not lose its prosperity. Why? Because of its correctness. Thus it is said: *Kun*: prospering, correct; the great person is auspicious, without blame.\n\nNine in the Second, firm, comes to dwell in the midst of *kan* peril—this is the great person. The nature of steadfast correctness does not lose itself in distress, so it does not fail to prosper. Auspicious and without blame—what doubt remains?\n\n*Kan* is wine, *dui* is food. Others see only the Second’s distress within confinement, unaware that it truly suffers within wine and food. Feasting and revelry continue as usual, oblivious to grievance. Thus the Fifth, though swayed by slander, repeatedly seeks to cut off its nose and feet, to distress it with the crimson knee-cover. Yet upon reflection, it finds release in the Second’s central uprightness, not believing the falsehoods of others. Thus the Second’s line says: \"The crimson knee-cover arrives; advantageous for offering and sacrifice.\" The Fifth’s line says: \"Advantageous for offering and sacrifice, receiving its blessing.\" The great person’s prosperity is all the more evident.\n\nThe Initial Six below, the image of buttocks, has the firm Nine in the Second as a withered tree before it. Dwelling at the bottom of *kan*, it enters the image of a dark valley, separated by three lines from encountering the Fourth—three years without hope. The First gazes toward the Fourth, three years like a single day, while the Fourth comes slowly, distressed by the Fifth’s metal chariot, unable to do otherwise.\n\nThough near at hand, it seems but regret—yet in the end, there is resolution. This is because the Fourth’s aspiration lies below, and the Initial is truly one who would join with it. Thus, though three years pass without hope, they must ultimately meet, ensuring no misfortune. The \"golden chariot\" is the chariot of the king. The \"crimson knee-cover\" and \"scarlet knee-cover\" are both used to adorn the chariot. The line *dui* represents metal, hence it is also called \"gold,\" \"crimson,\" and \"scarlet.\"\n\nNow, nothing is as hard and unyielding as stone, nor as sharp and piercing as the *xianhua* thorn. Here, the Six in the Third mounts the firm, its image like one trapped beneath solid rock, pressed atop thorns—truly confined, with no escape. Not only will the self be lost, but the household too shall perish. How can one hope to see one’s wife, or enter one’s palace? Such is the inauspicious calamity that befell the Nine Lords and the Earl of E.\n\nYet the Nine in the Second finds prosperity in adversity not merely by its own steadfastness, but by the gradual favor of the sagely and enlightened Heavenly King in the Fifth. When favor comes, slander is disbelieved, and those who wield words as weapons are brought to ruin. Looking back upon oneself, one finds the self entangled in creeping vines, unable to shield its roots; or trapped in brittle reeds, unable to find stability. Thus, facing the mouth of *dui* above, one speaks: \"In past actions, I truly repent.\" If one can truly repent, then misfortune turns to fortune, perversity to uprightness—how easily this may be! Would the great person, now embracing renewal, deign to contend with such a one?\n\nAh! This is what makes the great person great—this is how, even in adversity, they never fail to prosper, never fail to find good fortune, and remain without blame. If one truly possesses the steadfastness of the great person, what harm can adversity bring? This is no mere luck. Scholars must carefully ponder the phrase: \"confined by wine and food.\"\n\nMaster Fang Shihua asked: How can adversity lead to prosperity? Through peril tempered by joy. Thus, to be in adversity yet not lose one’s place is prosperity. Yet this is not possible for the ordinary person. The great person, dwelling in firmness and centeredness, does not covet what lies beyond. Though adversity may surround, how can it confine the center? With firmness, one remains unassailable, never sinking into adversity. How then can it become one’s own adversity? If it could, where would firmness reside?\n\nThus the sage said: Adversity is common to all. Yet the great person endures it in silence, as if untouched. Though in adversity, they never fail to prosper. If one laments, \"Why have I been brought to such extremity?\" or boasts, \"How could I fear this?\"—such is the path to misfortune, not the way of the great person’s good fortune and blamelessness.\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Zhaosou said: \"Three years without hope\" refers to passing through three lines from the Initial to the Fourth.\nWang Ji said: When water leaks downward, the marsh above dries—this is the image of exhaustion and adversity. *Dui*, with yin above, and *kan*, with yang below, represent the noble person oppressed by the petty, a time of hardship. \"Giving one’s life\" means surrendering it to others, no longer one’s own to command. \"Fulfilling one’s aspiration\" means realizing one’s good intentions without being swayed by misfortune.\n\n**Hexagram 48: The Well**\n*Xun* below *kan* above: The Well. The city may be changed, but the well cannot. There is no loss, no gain—people come and go, yet the well remains. Drawing near, one has not yet drawn from the well, but the jar is broken—misfortune.\n\n**The Judgment:**\n*Xun* enters water and raises it—this is the Well. The Well nourishes without end. The city may change, but the well does not—this is due to firmness and centeredness. Drawing near yet not drawing from the well means no merit has been achieved. The jar is broken—hence misfortune.\n\n**The Image:**\nWater above wood—this is the Well. The noble person encourages the people to labor and aid one another.\n\n**The Lines:**\n**Initial Six:** The well is muddy and undrinkable; an old well where no birds alight.\n**The Image:** The well is muddy and undrinkable—it lies too low. An old well where no birds alight—it is abandoned by the times.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** At the well’s hollow, one shoots at minnows; the jar is cracked and leaking.\n**The Image:** Shooting at minnows in the well’s hollow—there is no one to share with.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** The well is deep and undrinkable, causing sorrow in my heart. It may be drawn from; the king is enlightened, and all receive its blessing.\n**The Image:** The well is deep and undrinkable—one’s conduct is pitiful. Seeking the king’s enlightenment brings blessing.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** The well is tiled—no blame.\n**The Image:** Tiling the well brings no blame—this is repairing the well.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** The well’s waters are clear and cold, fit to drink.\n**The Image:** Drinking the cold spring’s waters—this is centeredness and correctness.\n\n**Top Six:** The well’s cover is not closed; with sincerity, there is great good fortune.\n**The Image:** Great good fortune at the top—this is great accomplishment.\n\nThe Well is the natural and inexhaustible source of nourishment. It has the power to sustain all things, but this depends on people drawing from it. If not drawn from, the well does not lose; if drawn from, the well does not gain. Those who come to draw—this well remains. Those who go without drawing—this well still remains. What remains is the well; those who come and go are people. Gain and loss belong to those who draw from the well—what does this have to do with the well itself?\n\nThus, the well may be drawn from but cannot compel people to draw—this is the virtue of *sheng*. Have you not seen how cities may change? Can the well be changed as well? The Nine in the Fifth dwells in the midst of *kan*, its firmness unchanging—truly like the well. Yet now, as one draws near the water, it has not yet been gathered, and the well’s pulley is already broken, the jar already cracked. What can be done? Though one draws daily, in truth, nothing is drawn.\n\nHere the omen of misfortune is already apparent—how can there be merit?\nThe First Six, dwelling below, resembles the bottom of a well.\nA newly dug well, still muddy, cannot be drunk from; an old well, its earthen walls crumbled and its village long abandoned, may have chickens and dogs all gone—though the well itself remains unchanged, who would draw from it?\nThe Nine in the Second, having lost its proper resonance, bears the image of a well-valley.\nThis well-valley is like the archer Yi shooting at Zhou. A leaking well with a broken jar—this is what is meant by \"worn and leaky.\"\nThe broken jar, like the muddy new well, cannot be drunk from; if left undrawn, it may still be abandoned.\nYet the Nine in the Third—here the well has been dredged, the spring made pure, yet it is not drunk from. Truly, this grieves my heart.\nWhy? It could be drawn from, yet one refuses to draw. The king’s lack of clarity is truly pitiable.\nIf the king were enlightened, he would surely draw and ascend, and those below would receive its blessing.\nThus the Master said: If a well is pure yet not drunk from, it does not merely grieve my heart—all who travel the Way see it and grieve.\nTherefore, to receive blessing, one must seek the king’s clarity.\nOtherwise, why would the king’s clarity be sought?\n\nThe Six in the Fourth is one who repairs the well—yet it is still not drunk from.\nThe Nine in the Fifth: the well is clear, and people drink from it.\nTruly, the cold spring is drinkable, sparing travelers from sorrow—without the king’s clarity above, how could this be achieved?\nThus, by the time we reach the Top Six, the well nourishes, and its bounty is inexhaustible.\nMorning and evening, one draws from it—do not cover it, do not seal it. Gather its jars, its pitchers; take as needed, and it will always suffice. This is because the Nine in the Fifth, centered and upright, possesses sincerity, and thus the blessing of the Top Six is supremely auspicious, bringing great completion above.\nIs this not what is meant by \"the enlightened king, and all receive its blessing\"? What need is there for the Five to seek it further?\n\nAlas! A single well—if left undrawn, it becomes a temporal abode, a broken jar, a cracked pitcher, causing all who see it to sigh in sorrow, yet none know how a single drawing could bring blessing.\nSuch is the unlabored kindness, the unasked-for grace. Let the king reflect and draw from it to attain clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Zizhan said: *Chi* means dryness. To reach the well but not yet the water is called *chi*. To reach the water but not yet draw it from the well is called \"not yet having drawn the well.\"\nThe well itself never gains or loses; the merit of the well-pulley and the misfortune of the cracked pitcher lie with the one who draws.\n\nLiu Junbo said: *Shou* means to gather the pulley and pitcher—this is the completion of drawing. *Wu mu* means the mouth of the *kan* is not covered, making its benefit public. *You fu* means the reality within *kan* is sincere, deep and inexhaustible.\n\nXiong Guo said: The First Six, dwelling below without resonance, resembles a muddy well. The Nine in the Second, without resonance and below its neighbor, resembles a valley’s slope. The Nine in the Third, having completed the work of *xun* entering, thus speaks of \"dredging our well.\"\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram 49: Ge (Revolution)**\n*After the day of ji, there is sincerity. Supreme prosperity, advantage in constancy—regret vanishes.*\n\n**The Judgment:**\nRevolution: water and fire extinguish each other; two women dwell together, their wills incompatible—this is called revolution.\n*After the day of ji, there is sincerity*—revolution is thus trusted.\nRadiant and joyful, greatly prosperous and upright—when revolution is fitting, regret vanishes.\nHeaven and earth revolutionize, and the four seasons are completed. Tang and Wu revolted against the mandate, following Heaven and responding to the people—great indeed is the timing of revolution!\n\n**The Image:**\nFire within the marsh: Revolution.\nThe noble one, in accordance with this, regulates the calendar and clarifies the seasons.\n\n**The Lines:**\n**First Nine:** Strengthen with the hide of a yellow ox.\n**The Image:** *Strengthen with the hide of a yellow ox*—one cannot act.\n\n**Six in the Second:** After the day of *ji*, revolutionize. To advance brings good fortune, no blame.\n**The Image:** *After the day of ji, revolutionize*—action brings praise.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** To advance brings misfortune; constancy is dangerous. When the words of revolution are thrice established, there is sincerity.\n**The Image:** *When the words of revolution are thrice established*—where else can one go?\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Regret vanishes. With sincerity, change the mandate—good fortune.\n**The Image:** *Good fortune in changing the mandate*—sincerity in purpose.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** The great person transforms like a tiger. Without divination, there is sincerity.\n**The Image:** *The great person transforms like a tiger*—their pattern is radiant.\n\n**Top Six:** The noble one transforms like a leopard; the petty person reforms their countenance. To advance brings misfortune; to dwell in constancy brings good fortune.\n**The Image:** *The noble one transforms like a leopard*—their pattern is lush. *The petty person reforms their countenance*—they follow the ruler in compliance.\n\n---\n\n**Marsh-Fire Revolution**\nThe revolutions of the times cannot be taken lightly—how much more so the great matter of transformation?\nShang Yang’s reforms were not without change, nor did they fail to swiftly strengthen Qin’s borders.\nYet after a year of implementation, thousands of Qin’s people spoke of its inconvenience, leading to punishments, the execution of its proponents, and the tearing apart of its architect—yet the people did not mourn. This was because the people’s hearts were not yet sincere, and he hastily sought revolution, startling them.\nIf the people are startled, who will trust him?\nThus it is said: *After the day of ji, there is sincerity*—only after revolution is there trust.\nTo say \"after the day of *ji*, there is sincerity\" means only after revolution is there trust. If one seeks revolution without sincerity, will the people not be startled?\nFor the people may be made to follow, but not to understand; they may be joined in celebrating success, but not in contemplating beginnings. Even the sage cannot but comply with this.\nOnly after compliance brings sincerity can revolution proceed. Once revolution is complete, sincerity naturally follows.\nSincerity lies not in the sage’s love of revolution, but in their recognition that revolution is unavoidable and fitting.\nHaving deliberated thoroughly and planned meticulously, there is supreme prosperity and advantage in constancy. When revolution is fitting, regret vanishes.\nPeople see only that the sage’s revolution is trusted by the people—how could they know the sage’s careful consideration of regret?\nRevolution truly begins and ends with this.\nThus all six lines speak of revolution, all speak of sincerity.\nThe First Nine, not yet sincere, does not dare to revolutionize. From the Six in the Second onward, revolution is complete, and the people are sincere.\n\nThe First Nine, dwelling below, though in a time requiring revolution, does not dare speak of revolution, thus employing the firmness of an oxhide’s leather. Its revolution is steadfast, like the unyielding hide of a yellow ox, inherently resistant to action. If as immovable as oxhide, even in a time calling for revolution, who would perceive one’s capacity for change or recognize one’s desire to revolutionize?\n\nThe Six in the Second resides at the center of *Li*, embodying the image of the *ji* day. The *ji* day is the day when revolution becomes fitting. Revolutionizing on the *ji* day brings auspicious征 and no blame. To act with excellence is indeed what is meant by \"like a startled crow\" or \"swift as thunder that leaves no time to cover one’s ears.\" As the Second aligns with the Fifth, it speaks of \"excellence.\" Since the Second is already ripe for revolution, by the Third, the day of revolution arrives. With such sincerity, if not revolutionized, what else remains? Though it is said to be overly rigid, bearing warnings of inauspicious征 and perilous constancy, this too considers potential future regret, ensuring the revolution is fitting—thus, it is not that revolution is impossible.\n\nAs for the Fourth, precisely at the moment of transformation, with people’s trust and resolve firmly established, how could it not be auspicious? Since the Fourth speaks of \"having sincerity,\" the Fifth, even before divination, is already known to possess it. What else could this be but the great stabilization of a new order, the renewal of creation, when the great person transforms like a tiger and the world’s culture shines forth? For this is an act that aligns with Heaven and responds to the people, carrying out the revolution of the four seasons. Its time is the *ji* day, the moment when sincerity in revolution is trusted. Its revolution is one of cultural brilliance and joy, of great prosperity and rectitude. Thus, by the time of the Top Six, the Dao of revolution is fully accomplished. The noble person leads with ritual and music, adorned with the rich patterns of a leopard. The petty person turns their face in submission, bowing in obedience to their lord. If one were to seek further征, would it not be inauspicious? Abiding in constancy brings good fortune, for the primal force has acted and transformation is complete.\n\nThe hexagram’s image shows *Li* fire below and *Dui* marsh above. Fire can overcome water, extinguishing it; water can overcome fire, likewise extinguishing it. This is the mutual suppression of water and fire, a revolution ordained by the Dao of Heaven. Moreover, *Dui* as the youngest daughter resides above, while *Li* as the middle daughter resides below—young and elder in reversed positions, dwelling together yet at odds in will. This is a revolution required by human affairs. Thus, only the sage can align above with the Dao of Heaven and respond below to the hearts of the people, uniquely capable of revolutionizing fittingly. Hence it is said: *primordial prosperity, advantage in constancy, regret vanishes.*\n\nFrom this, it follows that the *ji* day is when sincerity is achieved. Once revolution is complete and the people trust it, what doubt remains?\n\n---\n\n**Appendix**\nZheng Kangcheng said: *Ge* (革) means governance. Water and fire suppress each other and alternate in dominance, hence it is called *ge* (revolution).\n\nWang Fusi said: The people may be accustomed to the familiar but struggle to adapt to change; they may delight in completion but falter at the outset. Thus, the Dao of revolution is not trusted at first but gains trust on the *ji* day.\n\nCai Zimu said: *Primordial prosperity, advantage, constancy*—these are the virtues of *Qian*. *Sui* (随) means following things, while *ge* (革) means transforming them. Things cannot be blindly followed, so only with *primordial prosperity, advantage, and constancy* can one avoid blame. Nor can they be recklessly transformed, so only with *primordial prosperity, advantage, and constancy* can regret vanish.\n\nYu Lingsheng said: *Gong* (巩) means firmness. *Li* represents the cow. At the beginning of *Ge*, one cannot act rashly, hence it is said: *firm, using the leather of a yellow ox.*\n\nLiu Changmin said: The Fifth is the master of revolution, where martial might is proclaimed and cultural virtue shines. \"Three revolutions\" refers to the threefold issuance of commands, their decrees already enacted. \"Changing the mandate\" in the Fourth means trust and resolve are complete, all things follow transformation. By the Fifth, there is great prosperity and rectitude without pretense; divination confirms its sincerity.\n\nChang Jichang said: The tiger’s transformation embodies awe-inspiring virtue, subduing enemies a thousand miles away. Its influence is such that all trust at a glance—like Shun dancing with feathered banners and the Miao submitting, or the Duke of Zhou cultivating cultural virtue and the people of Yuechang presenting pheasants. Thus it is said: *even before divination, there is sincerity.*\n\nWang Deqing said: The tiger’s patterns are refined and radiant, while the leopard’s are dense and lush.\n\nSu Shi said: The *Yi* speaks of wind following the tiger. The tiger possesses patterns and spiritual power, while the leopard has patterns but lacks spiritual power.\n\nYang Xiong said: The wildcat transforms into a leopard, the leopard into a tiger.\n\nWang Ji said: Water and fire suppress each other as *ge* (革). *Ge* means change. The greatest of changes are the four seasons. In the governance of emperors and kings, nothing precedes the granting of time. The noble person observes the image of change and revolution to regulate the calendar, clarifying the sequence of the four seasons, the paths of the sun, moon, and five planets, the alternation of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. By tracking the sun and moon and examining the central stars, one can determine the four seasons—thus, regulating the calendar clarifies time. The image of *yin* below and *li* above yields the method of calendar-making. The calendar must be reformed yearly; without reform, celestial measurements gradually drift. This is the method of annual precession. Establishing the calendar’s epoch is merely its overarching framework.\n\n---\n*Xun* below, *Li* above\n**Ding (鼎): Primordial Auspiciousness. Offering.**\nThe *Tuan* says: *Ding* is an image. Wood submitting to fire represents cooking. The sage cooks to offer to the Supreme Divinity and grandly cooks to nourish the sagely and worthy. Submissive yet perceptive in hearing and sight, advancing gently and ascending, attaining the center and responding to the firm—thus *primordial prosperity.*\n\nThe *Xiang* says: Fire above wood is *Ding.* The noble person rectifies their position and solidifies their mandate.\n\n**First Six:** The *ding* overturns its legs. Favorable to expel the impure. Gaining a concubine for her son brings no blame.\nThe *Xiang* says: The *ding* overturns its legs—this is not perverse. Favorable to expel the impure, to follow the noble.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** The *ding* has substance. My rival has illness; they cannot approach me. Auspicious.\nThe *Xiang* says: The *ding* has substance—prudence in where one goes.\n\nMy rival has illness—ultimately no fault.\n**Nine in the Third:** The *ding*’s ears are transformed; its movement is blocked. The pheasant’s rich broth goes uneaten. As the rain just begins, regret diminishes—ultimately auspicious.\nThe *Xiang* says: The *ding*’s ears are transformed—this loses its proper function.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** The *ding*’s legs break; the duke’s stew is spilled. Its form is befouled—ominous.\nThe *Xiang* says: The duke’s stew is spilled—how can trust endure?\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** The *ding* has yellow ears and a golden beam—favorable to be steadfast.\nThe *Xiang* says: The *ding*’s yellow ears—centered, it serves as substance.\n\n**Top Nine:** The *ding* has a jade beam—greatly auspicious, supremely without harm.\nThe *Xiang* says: The jade beam above—hard and soft are moderated.\n\n**Fire over Wind: The Ding**\nFang Shihua says: The *Ding* is a hexagram image. The First Six represents the *ding*’s legs; the second, third, and fourth lines, all yang, represent its belly. The fifth, a single yin, represents its ears. The top, another yang, represents its beam. When wood enters fire, lifting the *ding* to cook—every household does this; what is there to speak of? Yet the sage, with a single cooking, offers to the Supreme Divinity, and with grand cooking nourishes the sagely and worthy. What is sagely? Submissive yet perceptive in hearing and sight. The Six in the Fifth, advancing gently and ascending, attaining the center and responding to the firmness of Nine in the Second—are these not the great sages and worthies? This is the cooking that nourishes the sagely and worthy. This, too, is the early offering to the Supreme Divinity. How is it supremely auspicious? How is it thoroughly prosperous? Thus this hexagram alone combines *supreme auspiciousness*, *great auspiciousness*, and *prosperity*.\n\nThe sage points to the Top Nine’s jade beam. The sagely and worthy refer to the Six in the Fifth, centered to serve as substance with yellow ears, threaded by the golden beam to be lifted. Nine in the Second, “the *ding* has substance,” is the vessel for nourishing the sagely and worthy. Though the third and fourth are also the *ding*’s substance, the third’s ears are transformed and cannot be lifted, while the fourth spills the stew and breaks its legs—thus only the second truly has the *ding*’s substance and can be used to nourish the sagely and worthy. The First Six, below as the *ding*’s legs, overturns its legs to expel the impure. Overturning the legs is contrary to the Way, yet it is said to be “not perverse” because it is favorable to expel the impure and follow the noble. “Gaining a concubine” is the image of expelling the impure; “for her son” is the image of following the noble, hence “no blame.”\n\nNine in the Second, firm and centered, has substance in the *ding*’s belly. Looking up at the third and fourth, they are truly my rivals. Yet the third’s ears are transformed, and the fourth spills the stew—they have illness and cannot approach me. Thus I cannot but offer my substance to the Fifth. If others shared the same substance, there would be reliance. Now only the second remains—how can one not be prudent? Without prudence, how could the supreme sage offer to the Supreme Divinity and nourish the sagely and worthy? The third stands at the time of transformation; its ears are altered and it cannot move, so the pheasant’s rich broth from the clinging fire goes uneaten. As the Top Nine’s rain just begins, regret from deficiency in response diminishes—yet what is lost is the *ding*’s nourishing function, while what remains is the vessel for nourishment. With the jade beam above, the ears will ultimately be lifted—hence “ultimately auspicious.” As for the fourth, the *ding*’s belly is already full, its legs break, and the stew is spilled, its form befouled and unusable. How can it be otherwise? The “centered to serve as substance” is the emptiness within *li*. What the *ding*’s substance relies on to be lifted lies entirely in this clarity of the center. This is called “centered to serve as substance,” hence “the *ding* has yellow ears.” The “golden beam” speaks of its ability to lift this substance: the Six in the Fifth, centered and yellow, serves as the ears, and uses yellow gold as the beam. Yellow is the color of the center, like gold. The image of lifting the ears must include the beam—there is no lifting the ears without the beam. Thus the Fifth combines “yellow ears” and “golden beam.” This is the steadfastness of the sagely and worthy, hence “favorable to be steadfast.”\n\nAs for the Top Nine, the *ding*’s substance is already lifted, supremely using the beam at the *ding*’s proper place. Thus it is named by its virtue of the jade beam, saying that the second and fifth, hard and soft, respond in moderation: the golden beam lifts, and the *ding*’s substance is consumed. The Top Nine’s jade beam is truly the supreme accomplishment of transformation. It is fitting that “greatly auspicious, supremely without harm” belong to it. “Greatly auspicious” is supreme auspiciousness; “without harm” is supreme auspiciousness and prosperity. The *Ding*’s supreme auspiciousness and prosperity—if this were merely about the mouth, as in *Yi*, what would there be to mention? Yet to the sage, nourishing the worthy extends to all the people—this is the *ding*’s cooking. In essence, there is no great matter, yet to the sage, nourishing the sagely and worthy is to offer to the Supreme Divinity.\n\nLiu Yongxiang says: If *Yi* were only about the mouth and *Ding* only about the belly, what would there be to observe in what is cooked and nourished? Ma Fengyang says: The sage cooks to offer to the Supreme Divinity, and grandly cooks to nourish the sagely and worthy. If one cannot grandly cook to nourish the sagely and worthy, then even if one wishes to offer to the Supreme Divinity, the Supreme Divinity will not accept it. Thus offering to the Supreme is called “cooking,” while nourishing the sagely and worthy is called “grand cooking.” How insignificant are the sagely and worthy in the world! Today one dies unused; tomorrow another dies unseen in their lifetime—how lamentable the *ding*! I know not what the cooking and nourishing are for.\n\n**Appendix**\n\nBear Guo says: According to Zixia’s *Tradition*, “The center is hollow to form the ears.” “My mate” is the noble person’s fine mate. The *Han Records of the Five Phases* and Yu Fan both say: “The *ding* moves by its ears.” If the ears are damaged, its movement is obstructed. The *ding*’s capacity reaches its limit at four; beyond that are the ears. To receive contents, there must be surplus capacity to allow for overflow; at four, it overflows and topples. Shao Guoxian says: “Five in the *ding* are the ears.” The ears are what admit the crossbar to lift it. “Above in the *ding* is the crossbar.” The crossbar is what threads through the ears to lift the *ding*. Yang Jian says: “Nothing transforms things like the *ding*. Tang and Wu’s revolution was truly mandated by Heaven. When Heaven commands the noble person to rectify their position, how can the noble person fail to rectify their position? Yet Heaven’s mandate cannot be relied upon. If one accords with Heaven, one’s mandate congeals; if one does not accord with Heaven, one’s mandate slips away and cannot be congealed.” Thus the noble person dare not forget Heaven even for an instant.\n\n☳ below, ☳ above\n*Shock*: offering.\n\nWhen the thunder comes with trembling dread, laughter and speech return in cheerful tones. The thunderclap resounds for a hundred *li*, yet the sacrificial ladle is not lost.\n\n*The Judgment* says: Thunder brings offering. When the thunder comes with trembling dread, fear brings forth blessing. Laughter and speech return in cheerful tones, for afterward there is a model to follow. The thunderclap resounds for a hundred *li*, startling the distant and alarming the near. Thus one may go forth to guard the ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain, serving as the master of sacrifice.\n\n*The Image* says: Repeated thunder is *Shock*. The noble person, in fear and trembling, engages in self-cultivation and reflection.\n\n**First Nine:** When the thunder comes with trembling dread, afterward laughter and speech return in cheerful tones—auspicious.\n*The Image* says: When the thunder comes with trembling dread, fear brings forth blessing. Laughter and speech return in cheerful tones, for afterward there is a model to follow.\n\n**Six in the Second:** The thunder comes perilously; a fortune in cowries is lost. Ascending to the ninefold hills, do not pursue—within seven days it will be regained.\n*The Image* says: When the thunder comes perilously, it is because one rides over the firm.\n\n**Six in the Third:** The thunder stirs restlessly; moving in shock, there is no blame.\n*The Image* says: The thunder stirs restlessly, for the position is not appropriate.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** The thunder sinks into the mire.\n*The Image* says: The thunder sinks into the mire, for its light has not yet shone.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** The thunder comes and goes perilously; a great fortune is lost, and there is activity.\n*The Image* says: The thunder comes and goes perilously, for one moves in danger. The matter lies in the center—great indeed is the loss.\n\n**Top Six:** The thunder trembles ceaselessly; one’s gaze is fixed and wandering, and to advance is ominous. The shock does not strike one’s own person but one’s neighbor—there is no blame. Yet in marriage alliances, there are words of reproach.\n*The Image* says: The thunder trembles ceaselessly, for the center has not been attained. Though ominous, there is no blame, for one fears the neighbor’s warning.\n\nThunder is the eldest son, the master of arousal. When the thunder comes and one is thus filled with dread and unease, it is because one fears that what brings forth blessing may not accord with the will of the Supreme. Therefore, one is startled into reflection, dare not rest at ease, and instead strengthens self-trust and self-cultivation. Then laughter and speech return in cheerful tones, saying: “From now on, I shall follow the seasons of Heaven and act without the slightest deviation from the Supreme’s model.”\n\nA single thunderclap startles the distant and alarms the near. If the lord of a hundred-*li* domain truly engages in fear and trembling, self-cultivation, and reflection, then the reach of his virtue and awe will extend for a hundred *li*, and it is fitting that his sacrificial ladle not be lost. Thus, as the eldest son, how could he not be the master of the ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain? How could there be no offering?\n\nIn ancient times, when the lord departed, the heir would guard the altars of soil and grain and serve as the master of sacrifice for the ancestral temples. Hence it is said that he may serve as the master of sacrifice.\n\nThe first line is the master of the completed *Shock*, so its words match the hexagram’s words, and its *Image* also matches the *Great Image*.\n\nSix in the Second rides over the firm, directly facing the coming thunder. Its peril and unease are extreme, and thus it suffers great loss of what it has long treasured. If it ascends to the ninefold hills, it becomes as the empty sky. No longer does it chase after the realm of appearances or the domain of thought. Thus, after seven days, the shock subsides, and it regains itself.\n\nFor Six in the Third, the lower shock is ending while the upper shock is beginning—its image is that of restless stirring. *Su* means revival. Six in the Third inwardly revives its resolve, reflecting and examining its conduct, knowing that its inner actions are of utmost importance. It guards against the slightest misstep.\n\nNine in the Fourth dwells in the time of doubled thunder, its heart filled with nothing but shock and dread. Yet the essence of shock lies in retreat and reflection. If one remains mired in fear without knowing to retreat and reflect, how can one ever expand and illuminate?\n\nSix in the Fifth experiences shock upon shock—not merely the coming of thunder. Six in the Second says “the thunder comes perilously,” for it rides over the firm and is thus in danger. Now Six in the Fifth says “the thunder comes and goes perilously,” for it moves in danger both coming and going. Yet Six in the Fifth, though it hears nothing, instead loses what it possesses in great measure. How could this be in a time without shock? Six in the Second, facing peril, lost what it treasured, thus losing what it fundamentally possessed—only afterward did it regain itself. This was the power of a single shock. Though Six in the Fifth moves in peril coming and going, it instead loses what it possesses in great measure because what it fundamentally possesses cannot be gained or lost by shock. This is what shock cannot shake. Ah, how perfect!\n\nYet if one does not move in the midst of peril coming and going, how can one test the depth of one’s learning and confirm that one cannot be moved to such an extent?\n\nThe Top Six dwells at the peak of shock, neighboring the Fifth. The Fifth is neither gained nor lost by shock, for it is beyond shock. Yet the Top Six is far from shock. The shock does not strike its own person but instead trembles ceaselessly, inwardly searching its heart and finding it empty, outwardly observing its conduct and finding nothing within—why then does it vainly pursue externals? Its ominousness is clear. Fortunately, it is close to Six in the Fifth and can trust in its neighbor’s great loss and activity. Thus, fearing the neighbor’s warning and hoping to share in its merit, it may yet avoid blame and escape misfortune.\n\nIf Six in the Third, in marriage alliances, reproaches it, saying: “You abandon your trembling, forget your shocked conduct, forsake your emptiness, and neglect your utmost importance—no longer will I join you in affairs,” it need not be concerned. One may know the thoroughness of the learning of the Way.\n\nThose below do not arouse without shock; those above do not cease without shock. Thus, in the aftermath of a single shock, each may lose something, each may arouse something, each may gain something, each may cease something—this is not comparable to other hexagrams.\n\nAh! When thunder crashes like swift lightning, all under Heaven are unsettled. The rebellious are executed, the unfilial are punished, and how could the lord who cultivates the Dao, the eldest son, fail to bring forth blessing?\n\nThe noble person, observing *Zhen* (Shock), may reflect with vigilance. The *Great Image* states: \"Thunder crashes—*Zhen*. The noble person, in fear and trepidation, cultivates introspection. There is reason for this.\"\n\n**Appendix**\nMaster Wu says: \"Qian’s yang is the lord; Kun’s earth is the state or domain. Dividing Qian’s single yang to preside over Kun makes the lord of a hundred-li domain.\"\n\nMaster Yu says: \"‘Distant’ refers to the outer body of the hexagram; ‘near’ refers to its inner body. With shock both within and without, there is the image of alarm near and far.\"\n\nZheng Kangcheng says: \"In the ruler’s sacrifices, only the spoon, sacrificial animal, body parts, and black millet are offered. When the sacrificial ox is raised upon the platter, the ruler’s minister who wields the spoon carries it forth. The fragrant wine and well-prepared millet—these are the refined offerings.\"\n\nXiong Guo says: \"*Zhen* is the foot. The foot mounts the first nine, hence it is called ‘Nine Ridges.’ The upper *su* speaks of the fading of the lower shock’s sound; the lower *su* speaks of the rebirth of the upper shock’s sound. ‘Shock comes and goes perilously’—the initial shock is the going, while the fourth’s harmonious thunder is the coming.\"\n\nWu Youqing says: \"*Su-su* is death and rebirth.\"\n\n---\n*Gen* below, *Gen* above\n*Gen*: \"Restraining the back, one does not grasp the whole body. Walking in the courtyard, one does not see its people—no blame.\"\n\nThe *Xiang* says: \"*Gen* means stopping. Stop when it is time to stop, move when it is time to move—neither action nor stillness loses its proper moment, and thus the Dao shines brightly. 'Restraining the stop' means stopping where it should be stopped. Above and below oppose each other, with no mutual response; this is why 'one does not grasp the whole body.' Walking in the courtyard and not seeing its people—this incurs no blame.\"\n\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Two mountains together—this is *Gen*. The noble person reflects and does not overstep his position.\"\n\n**First Six:** \"Restraining the toes—no blame. Favorable for eternal steadfastness.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Restraining the toes—this is not losing correctness.\"\n\n**Six in the Second:** \"Restraining the calves, unable to lift what follows—his heart is not at ease.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Unable to lift what follows—this is not yielding to retreat.\"\n\n**Nine in the Third:** \"Restraining the waist, splitting the spine—danger scorches the heart.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Restraining the waist—danger scorches the heart.\"\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** \"Restraining the body—no blame.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Restraining the body—stopping at the self.\"\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** \"Restraining the jaws, words in proper order—regret vanishes.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Restraining the jaws—this is central correctness.\"\n\n**Top Nine:** \"Reverent restraint—auspicious.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"The auspiciousness of reverent restraint—this is ending with thickness.\"\n\n*Gen* is the mountain. The two hexagrams *Zhen* and *Gen*—these are the great matters of the sage’s Dao of inquiry and learning. For all who engage in learning: as learning and inquiry grow daily more vast, what one hears and sees grows daily broader; as what one hears and sees grows broader, principles accumulate daily; as principles accumulate, cherishing them grows daily deeper. Day by day, accumulation deepens, and month by month, obstructions harden. Even the heroic and outstanding cannot free themselves—this is precisely what is called the deep pit of profit and desire, the snare that kills. Even if a sage dwelled among them, there would be nothing he could do. Yet they do not know that learning values knowing when to stop—stopping must have its place. Thus *Gen* takes the back as the place to stop, defining 'not grasping the body' and 'not seeing people' as the back. Stopping of itself where there is no place to stop—this is the perfect stop, the stop that knows where to stop. If even a thread of impurity remains, it is not the stop of the back. Thus from the toes upward, the five lines are all stops, but not of the back—they are not true stops.\n\n*Gen* of the toes is the learning of taking even a single step. *Gen* of the calves is the learning of wishing to stop but resenting the inability to stop—this is what one may hope for. *Gen* of the waist is restraining at the point of movement, forcibly demanding stillness—this is Gaozi’s learning of forcibly controlling the mind, with whom one can never speak. *Gen* of the body is disciplining the self. *Gen* of the jaws is being cautious in speech. These are all *Gen*, but they are not the difficult *Gen* to speak of. Without *Gen*, one cannot speak of learning, and thus the text concludes with \"reverent restraint.\" Yet the true learning of the world is not merely stopping. Stopping leads to stability, stability to stillness, stillness to peace—one can then reflect like a mirror, resonate like a struck bell, achieve balance, and govern the world while transcending it.\n\nHowever, if one is not roused by thunder to the point of losing life and fate, losing countless treasures, or losing great affairs, it is not easy to cleanse and suddenly stop. Fang Shihua says: \"The First Six, at the place of the toes, is able to restrain and stop—its freedom from blame is evident. For good fortune, misfortune, regret, and remorse all arise from moving the toes and then stopping; not moving would incur blame. Yet what is valued is 'favorable for eternal steadfastness.' How can one remain forever unmoving? Thus it says: 'no blame, favorable for eternal steadfastness.' If one can be eternally steadfast, then even movement incurs no blame.\"\n\nThe Master says: \"Stopping is difficult for people. But if one can restrain and stop, one naturally does not lose correctness. Perhaps through stopping one may even attain the place to stop—who can say? The world has never seen one who loves movement and does not stop who can stop where he should stop. This is why the images of the lines mutually elucidate one another.\"\n\nThe Six in the Second is at the place of the calves. The calves do not move on their own—this images the second line’s stopping of the calves, which cannot but follow the feet in movement, imaging the second line’s failure to find its place to stop. The calves, by nature, do not wish to move. Yet when they follow the feet in movement and have no means to lift them, this is why the Six in the Second is always ill at ease and resents its inability to subdue its own heart. Thus it says: \"not yielding to retreat.\" Yet the aspiration of the Six in the Second is truly pitiable.\n\n**Appendix**\nYang Jian says: \"One who stops well stops while walking the good path. One who knows where to stop but does not walk does not truly know where to stop. One who knows walking but does not know stopping does not truly know walking. Knowing that neither walking nor stopping is wrong, yet unable to unify the two—if both are timely, it is still not the bright Dao. Only when the four seasons alternate in their courses, when the sun and moon take turns shining, is there brightness—only then is the Dao of the *Yi* attained.\n\nA person’s spirit is entirely in the face, not in the back; entirely in the front, not in the rear. Thus the sage teaches 'restraining the back,' so that what the face turns toward, what the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet do, all follow the back. Then, though the applications intersect and the myriad affairs swarm, all is ultimately still. Seeing, hearing, speaking, moving, and the twists and turns of thought are like the transformations of heaven and earth. Only this is *Gen*, only this is stopping. If one restrains the face, though one stops, it is still movement. Knowing it moves and forcibly stopping it—it will never stop. Only by restraining the back does the face become like the back, the front like the rear, movement like stillness. Serene and without self, 'one does not grasp the body.' Though walking in the courtyard and interacting with people, one truly does not see them. Stopping where it should be stopped—this is stopping without a place, stopping without stopping. It is not stopping because one desires to stop, nor forcibly stopping what is not by nature still.\"\n\nFundamentally, there is stopping; fundamentally, there is a place. Now, to speak of \"stopping where it should be stopped\" is to stop at the fundamental place. Without a place, there is no stopping. Stopping without stopping—this is true stopping. This is what is meant by \"stopping where it should be stopped.\" If there is a self, then there is a place.\n\nXiong Guo says: According to ancient script, the character for \"back\" (背) is written as \"north\" (北), or sometimes as \"stop\" (止). Master Zui states that following the hexagram’s text, \"back\" is correct. Wang Ji says: Two thunder, two wind, two fire, two water, two marsh—all imply the meaning of going and coming. Only two mountains stand in mutual opposition, not going or coming to each other; thus, this is stopping. The office of the heart is thought; thought that does not transgress its position is called correct thought. Like water in a mirror, it responds to things yet remains constantly still. Like the sun and moon, their steadfast brightness transforms and acts, illuminating the myriad things yet never moving. When the function of the thinking heart clings to non-thought, it becomes sunk in emptiness. When it clings to thought, it becomes ensnared by things. Non-thought without non-understanding—this is the lost learning of a thousand sages.\n\nFormer scholars spoke of \"not transgressing one’s position\" as in \"one who is accustomed to wealth and honor acts within wealth and honor, one accustomed to poverty and lowliness acts within poverty and lowliness,\" focusing solely on responding to the near at hand, yet failing to clarify the fundamental purport of thought. However, \"thought that does not transgress its position\" is precisely the meaning of \"not desiring what is external.\" Heart and the near at hand are not divided into two separate matters. *Gen* means stopping. \"Stopping at the back\" is stopping where it should be stopped. The functions of the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and the four limbs all manifest in the face. Only the back does not move; thus, it is taken as the image. Though the back does not move, the five viscera all press against it; the nourishment of the nine orifices and the hundred bones is conveyed through the back. Thus, it is the function of non-function.\n\n*Yiyin*, Lower Canon, Scroll Two, ends here.\n(Variants: #1 \"de\" [德] in the Jigu Pavilion edition; #2 \"or\" [或] as \"I\" [我]; #3 \"resent me\" [愠我] as \"I resent\" [我愠]; #4 \"trusting cry has danger\" [孚号有厉] originally missing, now supplemented according to the Jigu Pavilion edition; #5 \"center\" [央] as \"end\" [夬]; #6 \"follow its constancy\" [道其常] as \"encounter its changes\" [遭其变]; #7 \"all\" [咸] as \"complete\" [成]; #8 \"woman\" [女] as \"you\" [汝]; #9 \"lead\" [牵] as \"bind\" [系]; #10 this sentence as \"thus alone contains the beauty of one’s own chapter, serving the firm center of the nine twos\"; #11 \"cannot\" [不能] as \"can\" [能不]; #12 the Jigu Pavilion edition omits one \"chapter\" [章] character here; #13 \"beneficial to have somewhere to go, following Heaven’s mandate\" [利有攸往，顺天命也] originally \"beneficial to have somewhere, following the great mandate\" [利有攸者，顺大命也], now corrected according to the standard *Zhouyi*; #14 after \"with\" [以], the Jigu Pavilion edition omits \"as\" [为], now supplemented; #15 after \"one line ascends\" [一爻升], likely missing \"then\" [即]; #16 originally \"great\" [大], the Jigu Pavilion edition has \"wood\" [木], now corrected accordingly; #17 \"preserve and not incur misfortune\" [保不致凶] as \"thus not tied to misfortune\" [故不系以凶也]; #18 \"origin\" [元] likely \"without\" [无]; #19 \"marsh fire revolution\" [泽火革] originally \"marsh water revolution\" [泽水革], corrected according to context; #20 \"use\" [用] originally \"solid\" [固], corrected according to context and the Jigu Pavilion edition; #21 \"day\" [日] originally \"and\" [而], corrected according to the Jigu Pavilion edition; #22 \"image\" [象] originally \"elephant\" [象], corrected according to context; #23 \"offer\" [享] originally \"prosper\" [亨], corrected according to the standard *Zhouyi* and context; #24 after \"image\" [象], the Jigu Pavilion edition omits \"ding\" [鼎], now supplemented; #25 this sentence originally \"exiting negativity obtains concubine image, following nobility with child image, thus without blame\" [出否得妾象，从贵以子象，故无咎], now corrected according to the Jigu Pavilion edition; #26 \"verify\" [验] originally \"horse\" [马], corrected according to the Jigu Pavilion edition.)\n\n*Yiyin*, Lower Canon, Scroll Three\n*Gen* below, *Xun* above\n\n**Gradual Progress (Jian)**\n*Marriage of a woman is auspicious; perseverance in rectitude is favorable.*\n\n**The Judgment (Tuan):**\nGradual progress means the woman’s marriage is auspicious.

The noble person abides in virtuous power and refines customs.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Six:**\nThe wild goose gradually advances to the shore.\nA youth is in peril; there is talk, but no blame.\n**The Image:**\nThe peril of the youth is blameless in principle.\n\n**Six in the Second Place:**\nThe wild goose gradually advances to the sandbar.\nFeasting with joy—auspicious.\n**The Image:**\nFeasting with joy is not mere idle satiety.\n\n**Nine in the Third Place:**\nThe wild goose gradually advances to the highland.\nThe husband goes forth and does not return; the wife conceives but does not bear—ominous.\nFavorable for warding off raiders.\n**The Image:**\nThe husband goes forth and does not return—he parts from the flock.\nThe wife conceives but does not bear—she loses the Way.\nFavorable for warding off raiders—compliance ensures mutual protection.\n\n**Six in the Fourth Place:**\nThe wild goose gradually advances to the tree.\nPerhaps it finds a perch—no blame.\n**The Image:**\nPerhaps it finds a perch—compliance and submission prevail.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth Place:**\nThe wild goose gradually advances to the hill.\nThe wife does not conceive for three years, yet none can overcome her—auspicious.\n**The Image:**\nNone can overcome her—auspicious, for she attains her desire.\n\n**Top Nine:**\nThe wild goose gradually advances to the highland.\nIts feathers may be used for ceremonial adornment—auspicious.\n**The Image:**\nIts feathers may be used for ceremonial adornment—auspicious, for they cannot be disordered.\n\n**Wind over Mountain: Gradual Progress**\nFang Shihua says: *Influence (Xian)* and *Gradual Progress* both concern the union of man and woman. Yet *Influence* means mutual resonance—a matter of great significance in learning and inquiry. Thus, though it takes the marriage of a woman as its theme, it does not speak solely of marriage. *Gradual Progress*, however, addresses it directly.\n\nThe initial stage of a woman’s marriage is like the first line. The second and fifth lines represent the proper course of a woman’s marriage. The third and fourth lines represent its expedient adaptations. The top line embodies the constancy of a woman’s chastity.\n\nWhen a woman is about to marry, she is like a wild goose leaving the water—hence the reference to the shore. Marriage is not yet complete, so she is called a \"youth.\" A young woman, newly betrothed, must leave her parents and brothers, feeling uneasy and anxious—hence the terms \"peril\" and \"talk.\" This is the natural state of a woman; how could it be blameworthy in principle?\n\nThe sandbar is a stone in the water. To advance there and feast with ease, self-reliant and unperturbed, is like the steadfastness of Meng Guang. Such a woman does not merely seek satiety—hence the auspiciousness.\n\nThe fifth line’s advance to the hill is not unstable, but she refuses to settle rashly. Though she does not conceive for three years, she is not barren—she refuses to bear children through a hasty match. Yet none can overcome her, for she either chooses a single partner without remarrying or rejects many suitors before finally fulfilling her wish—like Liang Hong. This is the proper course of a woman’s marriage, embodied in the second and fifth lines.\n\nThe third line has no proper correlate. With whom can it pair? The wild goose advancing to the highland is a sign of instability. Separated from its kind, it rises alone among two yin lines. The husband’s failure to return is not by choice; forced to accept the fourth line, he dares not openly raise a child. The wife’s failure to bear is ominous. Yet a lone woman without support cannot form a union. Who, then, wards off raiders?\n\nThe fourth line is also uneasy. If the wild goose advances to a tree, is that a proper perch? Its compliance and submission arise from necessity, having no proper correlate or support. A woman without support faces grave peril. If she finds a perch, she may avoid blame. This describes the third and fourth lines forming a union through mutual proximity—the expedient adaptation of a woman’s marriage.\n\nAlas! If a wild goose loses its mate, it will never pair again. Flying alone, it cries out sharply—so unyielding that its feathers may be used for ceremonial adornment. Like the third line, it has no proper correlate and is unstable, hence the shared image of the highland.\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Fusi says: Advancing to the highland and aligning with the fourth line means it cannot return. The husband does not return—does he delight in depravity? If he takes a wife, she cannot uphold chastity. Conceiving by another, she cannot bear—this is the path of misfortune. The third line, originally of the *Gen* trigram, abandons its flock and aligns with the fourth, never returning. This leads the wife to conceive but not bear—a path of misfortune. Yet when different natures unite in harmony, compliance ensures mutual protection, and none can intervene—hence the favor in warding off raiders.\n\nXiong Guo says: The fourth line, of the *Xun* trigram, is the remnant of wood—hence the wild goose advancing to a tree may find a perch. Li Dingzuo notes: The fourth line occupies a yin position, fitting the image of a perch.\n\nMaster Yu says: The fifth and second lines correspond—this is the proper union of husband and wife, hence auspicious. The third and fourth lines are adjacent—this is an improper match, hence ominous.\n\n**Marrying Maiden (Guimei)**\n*Advancing brings misfortune; nothing is favorable.*\n\n**The Judgment (Tuan):**\n*Marrying Maiden* embodies the great principle of Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth do not unite, the myriad things cannot flourish. *Marrying Maiden* marks the beginning and end of human life. Joy in movement—this is the marriage of a maiden. Advancing brings misfortune, for positions are not proper. Nothing is favorable, for the yielding rides upon the firm.\n\n**The Image (Xiang):**\nThunder over the marsh—this is *Marrying Maiden*. The noble person, understanding decay, ensures lasting fulfillment.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Nine:**\nThe marrying maiden serves as a concubine.\nThough lame, she can walk—advancing is auspicious.\n**The Image:**\nThe marrying maiden serves as a concubine—this is the norm.\nThough lame, she can walk—auspicious in mutual support.\n\n**Nine in the Second Place:**\nThough blind in one eye, she can see—favorable for the chastity of a reclusive person.\n**The Image:**\nFavorable for the chastity of a reclusive person—she has not altered her constancy.\n\n**Six in the Third Place:**\nThe marrying maiden waits, then returns as a concubine.\n**The Image:**\nThe marrying maiden waits—her position is not proper.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth Place:**\nThe marrying maiden delays her wedding; her return awaits the proper time.\n\n**The Image:**\nThe delayed wedding’s intent—acting with proper timing.\n\n**Six in the Fifth Place:**\nWhen Emperor Yi marries off his younger sister, the lord’s sleeves are not as fine as her concubine’s sleeves.\nThe moon nears fullness—auspicious.\n**The Image:**\nWhen Emperor Yi marries off his younger sister, the concubine’s sleeves surpass the lord’s.\nHer position is central—she proceeds with nobility.\n\n**Top Six:**\nThe woman holds an empty basket, yet no fruit;\nThe man slaughters a sheep, yet no blood.\nNo advantage in any direction.\n**The Image:**\nThe Top Six’s empty basket—she bears a hollow vessel.\n\n**Thunder over Marsh: Marrying Maiden**\nThis is the gradual progression of a woman into marriage.\nThough wed, she does not immediately assume the central position of the inner palace as empress.\nFrom consort to empress, she advances by degrees—hence the term *gradual*.\nNow, in *Marrying Maiden*, all who are given in marriage are women.\nYet only the woman who marries as the primary wife is auspicious, while the marrying maiden’s advance is ominous—why?\nBecause the woman who marries as the primary wife assumes the proper position, that of the *Lady Sovereign*.\nThus, it is said: *favorable for constancy*—*constancy* meaning *proper position*.\nBy advancing gradually to approach the ruler’s rightful place, her progress yields merit—hence: *advancing brings merit*.\nBy gradually assuming the proper position within, she may rectify the virtue of all women in the state—hence: *she may rectify the state*.\nMoreover, the ruler’s position is firm and centered—this is the Nine in the Fifth Place.\nThe position of the lord’s wife is both *still* and *yielding*, her movement inexhaustible.\nSuch is the advantage of propriety—this is why the woman who marries as the primary wife is auspicious.\nNow, in *Marrying Maiden*, the Top Six’s lines depict a young girl given in marriage to another—mere concubinage, how can it compare?\nFurthermore, she moves only when pleased by another’s will.\nIf she acts on her own, her advance is surely ominous—what advantage could there be?\n\nThe passage speaks of the maiden bearing a basket with nothing inside, and the gentleman presenting a sheep with no blood—this signifies that when the woman’s family gives her in marriage bearing a basket, it should contain something, yet if she is not a concubine or secondary wife, then she bears a basket with nothing inside. When the man’s family takes a bride and offers a sheep to present its blood, if concubines and secondary wives are not included, then though a sheep is slaughtered, there is no blood to present.\n\nMoreover, the Top Six, being yielding, rides atop the Fifth’s firmness, hence there is no advantage in any direction, for her position is improper. To rise above the position of the lady of the house is called \"advancing brings misfortune.\" Thus, this line is fittingly assigned to her.\n\nOf the remaining five lines, excluding the Nine in the Fourth Place, which occupies the upper position without correspondence—representing the elder sister awaiting her time and not yet married—while the Fifth occupies the central position, a place of honor and nobility. This is the younger sister of King Di Yi, married to the eldest son. The Second is her proper counterpart—is she not the favored concubine? Yet she is not as fine as the concubine, for the Fifth is yin while the Second is yang. \"One-eyed yet able to see\" means she follows the lady and dare not look directly. She does not presume to take the evening watch, guarding her solitude in seclusion—hence it is said: \"advantageous for the secluded one to maintain integrity.\" How is this different from a maiden in her chamber? Thus, it is said: \"she has not altered the norm.\"\n\nThe First and Second share the same body, following the Nine in the Second—this is constancy. At home, she follows her\n\nThe *Thunder-Fire Feng* Hexagram: Fang Shihua’s Commentary\n\nFeng means greatness. When the grand yang illumines the heavens, all beings stir into motion—thus its greatness is evident. Yet if dusk approaches, all motion ceases. How then can its greatness be perceived? This greatness—who makes it so? The king makes it so. The king, turning toward brightness to govern, esteems greatness; hence it is said, \"the king attains it.\" *Jia* means greatness. The king values greatness, yet in this hexagram, the radiance of *Li* lies below while the movement of *Zhen* thunders above. *Li* below is not merely past its zenith—it nears dusk. *Zhen* above not only obscures the sun at noon—it brings dark clouds and gloomy rain. One fears the lack of brightness—how can there be greatness? Yet the sun at noon will reverse its course, and once reversed, it must return to midday. Thunder’s movement brings only darkness, but when it passes, brightness must return. Though *Li*’s radiance now lies below, the sun will naturally reach its zenith again. Though *Zhen*’s thunder now rolls above, the sun will naturally illuminate all under heaven once more. Why fear the sun’s failure to reach midday or the world’s lack of illumination? Thus it is said: \"Do not worry. It is fitting for the sun to be at midday, fitting to illuminate all under heaven.\" At midday, there is brightness; with brightness, there is movement; with movement, there is greatness. This is the king’s work. Who but the Sixth Five can fulfill this? Hence it is said: *lai zhang* (\"bringing splendor\"). *Lai zhang* means the Sixth Two’s midday splendor is drawn forth. The auspiciousness of celebration and praise is the prosperity of *feng*. The Sixth Two is the master of *Li*, the sun at its zenith, yet with thunder above, it bears the image of *feng*’s obscuring reeds and the Dipper seen at noon. Though one may doubt the sun’s presence when traveling, what harm befalls it? Its brilliance remains, and its sincerity never fails to shine. Who causes the obscuring reeds? The Nine Four does. Four resides in the *Zhen* trigram, the thunder’s first stir. Thus it is said: \"Its position is not proper, for it obscures its place.\" The Dipper seen at noon—dim and unclear—is injured; is this not *ming yi* (\"darkening of the light\")? Yet when clouds disperse and veils lift, the sun at noon reappears, and one again encounters the lord of brightness. Though dim and unclear, how can this not be auspicious? The auspiciousness of Four is like that of Five and Two. Since it is midday, the celebration of greatness is shared by all. Thus it is said: \"Auspicious, for it moves forward.\"\n\nThe Initial Nine and Six Two share the same luminous body. When the Initial meets the Second, does it not meet its proper lord? Yet because the Second is obscured by the reeds of *feng*, it is told: \"Even if ten days pass, after rain there will surely be the celebration of midday. Going forth, you will naturally find your match—why fear misfortune?\" The *Xiang* commentary further judges this as certain, for the principle of \"beyond ten days\" does not apply. If it exceeds ten days, it becomes calamity—no need to worry.\n\nThe Nine Three, positioned beneath the thunder’s movement, brings not only dark clouds and rain but torrential downpours. When the roads are awash with foam, even at midday, can one venture out? Of the three lines in *Li*, only the Second is at midday; the Initial and Third are like left and right arms. Yet the Third cannot move—it bears the image of a broken right arm. \"No misfortune\" means the passing of dark rain is not the fault of Nine Three. Truly, without brightness, there is no movement; to move without brightness is not greatness. Thus greatness for all under heaven is what the king esteems.\n\nThose who \"enlarge their houses\" act otherwise. They do not consider the sun at midday illuminating all under heaven, ensuring no one beneath it is left unenlightened. Instead, they diminish above to enrich below, enlarging their own houses, as if to say: \"I stand high above—who can do anything to me?\" Yet what use is this to anyone? For when a household has no one, when doors are shut and no one is seen, when ice melts and tiles crumble, leaving no trace—how dire is the misfortune! Thus the *Xiang* mocks them: \"When they enlarged their houses, they thought themselves soaring at heaven’s edge, as if roaming the skies—yet they did not realize this was precisely how they buried their own homes. For when a house has no household, when doors have no one to hide, this is called self-enlargement and self-burial—what use is a grand house then? This is no fault of others but of self-illumination that does not consider illuminating all under heaven. Those who illuminate themselves cannot illuminate others and instead fall into darkness. Yet those who illuminate all under heaven, though thunder and rain fill the skies, remain as if the sun is ever at its zenith. Thus the king should be at midday, illuminating all under heaven. To illuminate all under heaven is to bring greatness to all under heaven. Bringing greatness to all under heaven, even at its utmost, is not about seeking grandeur or delighting in achievement—celebration and praise naturally return to one. How can this compare to those who enlarge their houses and self-obscure, becoming isolated and ultimately burying themselves?\"\n\n**Appendix**\n*Fa qi hu, ban qi wu ren* (\"shutting the door, planking over the absence of people\"): *Fa* means to eliminate; *tai* means to discard. *Wei* means a small view; *tai mu* means to discard the eyes. Thus it speaks of first looking narrowly, then even with eyes wide open, seeing no one.\n\n---\n**Hexagram 56: *Lǚ* (Traveling)**\n*Lǚ*: Small prosperity. Perseverance in travel brings good fortune.\n\n**The *Tuan* Commentary**\n*Lǚ*: Small prosperity. The yielding attains the center externally and follows the firm. It halts yet clings to brightness—thus there is small prosperity. Perseverance in travel brings good fortune. The timeliness of travel is greatly significant.\n\n**The *Xiang* Commentary**\nFire beneath the mountain: *Lǚ*. The noble one uses clarity and caution in applying punishments, not prolonging imprisonment.\n\n**The Lines**\n**Initial Six**: In travel, petty and mean—this brings misfortune upon oneself.\n**The *Xiang* Commentary**: Petty and mean in travel—misfortune arises from a constrained will.\n\n**Six Two**: In travel, one lodges at an inn, holding one’s resources, and obtains a steadfast servant.\n**The *Xiang* Commentary**: Obtaining a steadfast servant—ultimately, there is no blame.\n\n**Nine Three**: In travel, one’s inn burns. One loses one’s servant. Perseverance brings danger.\n\n**The *Xiang* Commentary**\nThe inn burns in travel—this is indeed grievous. To travel and yet yield to inferiors—by principle, one loses all.\n\n**Nine Four**: In travel, one finds shelter, gains one’s resource-axe, yet the heart remains indecisive.\n**The *Xiang* Commentary**: Traveling in shelter—one has not attained position. Gaining one’s resource-axe—the heart is not at ease.\n\n**Six Five**: Shooting a pheasant, one arrow is lost; in the end, praise and mandate follow.\n**The *Xiang* Commentary**: In the end, praise and mandate—this reaches the highest.\n\n**Top Nine**: The bird’s nest burns; the traveler first laughs, then wails and weeps. An ox is lost at the frontier—misfortune.\n**The *Xiang* Commentary**: To travel while in the highest position—by principle, it burns. An ox lost at the frontier—none in the end hear of it.\n\n**Fire over Mountain: *Lǚ***\nFang Shihua says: Fire rising above the mountain—travelers set forth. Lodging in the wild, eating and resting—such is the traveler’s nature, hence it is called *Lǚ*. How does travel bring prosperity and good fortune? With *li*’s yielding in the outer position attaining the center, and submitting to *gèn*’s stillness within—the master’s firmness—thus the inner trigram’s stillness can cling to the outer trigram’s brightness. The master thereby achieves merit for the traveler, and the traveler naturally attains prosperity and good fortune, all through the constancy of travel.\n\nThe inner three lines represent the travels of merchants, scholars, and commoners—ordinary travel. Thus their gains and losses concern only the inn and servants. The outer three lines represent the travels of lords, ministers, and grandees—here, travel is momentous. Some rise through travel, others fall, hence it is said: *The timeliness of travel is greatly significant.*\n\n**Initial Six**, yin at the lowest, bears the image of petty travel, knowing only what travel should be. Petty and ignorant—this is why misfortune befalls. Had it been more generous, even the servant would have received a share of grace. Yet yin’s softness risks pettiness, while yang’s firmness risks excess. **Nine Three**, yang in a yang position, is excessive. Dry and near *li*, it bears the image of a burning inn; below, it loses the first, bearing the image of a lost servant. For Initial Six, of the same body below, is the servant’s image. Six Two, yielding and centered, draws near the first and gains it; Nine Three, overly firm, distances itself from the first and loses it. Thus the *Xiang* says: *The inn burns in travel—this is indeed grievous.* How could it also involve losing a servant? For in travel, to yield to inferiors thus—if one did not lose a servant, it would defy principle. Hence it is said: *by principle, one loses all.* Pettiness is difficult, but enduring excess—how can one bear it? Excess only deepens pettiness.\n\n**Six Two**, centered, bears the image of lodging at an inn; yielding and correct, it bears the image of holding resources; gaining the first, it bears the image of obtaining a steadfast servant—this is the most fortunate of ordinary travels. **Nine Four**, ascending to Five, bears the image of traveling in shelter. Those above should occupy their position and fulfill their duties. Yet if today they lodge here, tomorrow there, drifting from place to place, even if they gain their resource-axe, they remain rootless wanderers—how can the heart be at ease? At its extreme, **Top Nine** has *li*’s fire above, bearing the image of burning. *Li*’s eye sheds tears, bearing the image of wailing and weeping. *Li* nurtures the cow; the top yang loses it, bearing the image of an ox lost. Yet below, the inn burns; above, the nest burns—because the traveler below stops at the inn, while the traveler above, by necessity, loses their nest entirely. Were not Xia Taikang and Sui Yang Guang such cases? At first, they laughed in self-satisfaction; in the end, though they wailed, what good did it do? To seize great things and lose them all—had they even heard of their own misfortune, how could it be anything but dire?\n\nThus it is said: \"With the traveler above, its principle is burning.\" This means that one who dwells above others yet remains a traveler on the road—if their nest is not burned, it is still inevitably doomed. Only the fifth line achieves success in this position. *Li* is the pheasant; the fifth line’s traveler shoots the pheasant. Initially, it was the image of Qian’s three yangs, like three arrows striking true. But when yang suddenly shifts to yin, one arrow is lost. In travel, this becomes the image of initial ventures failing or first undertakings going awry. Yet, abandoning Qian’s firm strength to attain the gentle brilliance of *wen*, one ultimately gains literary renown and a lofty mandate through the act of shooting the pheasant—hence it is said to \"reach above.\" Were not Xia Shaokang, Qi Xiaobai, and Jin Chong’er such cases?\n\nThe noble person observes travel and knows that those below cannot avoid going forth, while those above cannot lightly depart. Those who cannot avoid going forth do so either to seek fame and achievement or to amass wealth and profit. They treat servants as their own children and serve their masters as elder brothers; they do not covet money, nor do they lightly express joy or anger—thus they remain free of trouble forever. But how can those above travel on the road? If travel is unavoidable for those above, it is not for the sake of reputation or mandate; to \"reach above\" is decisively impossible.\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Ji said: \"Fire upon the mountain shines but does not illuminate—this is the image of brightness restrained and caution. Fire moves and does not stay—this is the image of impermanence. Travel is always adverse, but nothing is worse than being imprisoned. Prisons are established out of necessity; how can one remain trapped and long detained? Be as illuminating as fire, as steadfast as a mountain. All who sojourn abroad are travelers. The Son of Heaven has the Son of Heaven’s travels—such as when the Heavenly King resided in Zheng. The feudal lords have the feudal lords’ travels—such as when the Duke was assigned to Qianzhou. The grand officers have the grand officers’ travels—such as Chen Wenzi’s sojourn in another state. The sages and worthies have the sages’ and worthies’ travels—such as Confucius’s circuitous journeys and Mencius’s diplomatic missions.\n\nLiu Yongxiang said: \"King Wen traveled amid hardship, yet his intimacy was profound and his thoughts abundant—hence it is said, 'The traveler is petty and brings disaster upon himself.' It is also said: 'When traveling and lodging, though one gains their resource-axe, my heart is not at ease—how grievous! Traveler, who but King Wen could bear this?' The Master traveled east, west, south, and north—thus it is said: 'To travel with those below is to lose; to travel with those above is to burn.' There is no permissible course, whether above or below.\"\n\n**Xun (Wind)**\n*Xun*: Small success. Beneficial to have somewhere to go; beneficial to see the great person.\n\n**The Judgment** says: \"Repeated *xun* to issue commands. The firm *xun* in the center and correct, and their will is carried out. The yielding all submit to the firm—thus there is small success. Beneficial to have somewhere to go; beneficial to see the great person.\"\n\n**The Image** says: \"Following wind is *xun*. The noble person issues commands and carries out affairs.\"\n\n- **Initial Six**: Advancing and retreating—beneficial for the warrior’s steadfastness.\n  **The Image** says: \"Advancing and retreating—this is a wavering will. Beneficial for the warrior’s steadfastness—this is a disciplined will.\"\n\n- **Nine in the Second**: *Xun* beneath the forest. Employing scribes and shamans, profuse and auspicious—no blame.\n  **The Image** says: \"The auspiciousness of profusion—this is attaining the center.\"\n\n- **Nine in the Third**: Frequently *xun*—regret.\n  **The Image** says: \"The regret of frequent *xun*—this is a will exhausted.\"\n\n- **Six in the Fourth**: Regret vanishes. In the hunt, three kinds are obtained.\n  **The Image** says: \"In the hunt, three kinds are obtained—this is meritorious.\"\n\n- **Nine in the Fifth**: Steadfast and auspicious, regret vanishes. Nothing is initially beneficial. Without beginning, there is an end. Three days before *geng*, three days after *geng*—auspicious.\n  **The Image** says: \"The auspiciousness of Nine in the Fifth—this is the position of correctness and the center.\"\n\n- **Top Nine**: *Xun* beneath the bed. Losing one’s resource-axe—misfortune.\n  **The Image** says: \"*Xun* beneath the bed—this is exhaustion above. Losing one’s resource-axe—this is truly misfortune.\"\n\n**Xun is wind.**\nFang Shihua said: \"Wind is Heaven’s decree; commands are the ruler’s wind. When the great lord issues a mandate, thrice commanding and fivefold reiterating, he desires *xun* to penetrate—hence repeated *xun* to issue it. The nine in the second, firm yet *xun* in the center and correctness of the fifth, thus the will of issuing commands is carried out, and the yielding all submit to the firm. Therefore, there is small success, beneficial to have somewhere to go, and beneficial to see the great person. The benefit of having somewhere to go and the benefit of seeing—what else could this be but the small success of the lesser?\"\n\nNi’s *xun* says: \"The lord issues commands to proclaim to the four directions.\" Huan’s *xun* says: \"Huan sweats its great proclamation.\" Thus, nothing is as yielding yet able to *xun* and penetrate others as wind; nothing is as firm yet nothing can resist it as wind. Nothing dares not submit—only the nine in the fifth is sufficient to embody this, hence it is called the great person.\n\nMaster Yu said: \"*Jia* is the first of the ten stems, the beginning of affairs. When disorder is restored to order, it is as if returning to the start—hence in *Gu*, *jia* is said: 'In the end, there is a beginning.' *Geng* is the turning point of the ten stems, the proper moment for change in affairs. If the beginning was not good, it is changed and afterward becomes good—hence in *Xun*, *geng* is said: 'Without beginning, there is an end.' Three days before *geng*, three days after *geng*—repeatedly issuing commands—precisely means being cautious to the end. Thus, the end is auspicious. Therefore, only the fifth is steadfast and auspicious, with regret and nothing initially beneficial.\"\n\nThe initial six, at the beginning of *xun*, in terms of constant correspondence should respond to the fourth, but in terms of timing should submit to the fifth. Advancing and retreating without resolution—this is doubt. Not knowing that the fourth has decisively submitted to the fifth and eliminated the regret of indecision, it becomes the small success of the lesser and the meritorious minister. How martial! Moreover, the fourth submits to the fifth, and the three lines below all submit to the fifth—is this not the hunt obtaining three kinds? The fourth hunts and obtains three kinds—this is the warrior. Thus, it is beneficial for the initial line’s steadfastness as a warrior. Yet in the hexagram, only two yielding lines both submit to the firm—the fourth is their forerunner.\"\n\nThe *xun* wood becomes the piglet in the second line, situated below—this depicts the image of submission. Employing scribes and shamans in profuse confusion—is this not what is meant by \"firm yet yielding, centered and upright, with aspirations fulfilled\"? Thus, it is called auspicious and blameless.\n\nAs for the nine in the third place, it inquires doubly into submission, seemingly desiring to yield to the fifth but with aspirations truly fixed upon the nine above in its exhausted adversity. The nine above, dwelling at the apex of double submission, also yields to what lies below. One who reaches the utmost height must return to what is below. To avoid losing one’s axe and resources is impossible. The fourth’s obtaining of three kinds was for the sake of securing the initial line’s benefit as a martial figure, yet now it forfeits its axe and resources, unaware of whom it should submit to. Though it yields beneath the forest, what use is it? Thus, it is said, \"steadfastness brings misfortune.\" This means that in a time of submission, submission itself is indeed steadfastness, yet without knowing whom to submit to, even steadfastness leads to misfortune. Hence, it is also said, \"Is this upright? I see only misfortune.\" This should be read as two separate phrases.\n\nXiong Guo remarked: \"Zhai Yun’s 'three kinds' refer to the three lower lines.\" Yang Tingshu said: *\"The Shuo Gua* states that Xun (☴) embodies advance and retreat, hence its ultimate form is a restless hexagram, thus martial.\" **Dui (☱) below, Dui (☱) above: Dui.** Smooth progress, beneficial, steadfast.\n\n**The *Tuan* says:** Dui means joy. Firmness within and softness without—joy brings benefit through steadfastness. Thus, it accords with Heaven and responds to humanity. Joy leads the people, and they forget their toil; joy faces adversity, and they forget death. The greatness of joy spurs the people to effort.\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** Twin lakes form Dui. The noble person engages in discourse and study with friends.\n\n**First Nine:** Harmonious joy—auspicious.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The auspiciousness of harmonious joy lies in unhesitating action.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** Trusting joy—auspicious, regret vanishes.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The auspiciousness of trusting joy lies in the sincerity of one’s intent.\n\n**Six in the Third:** Seeking joy—misfortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The misfortune of seeking joy stems from an improper position.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Deliberating joy—restless, yet illness yields to joy.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The joy of Nine in the Fourth brings celebration.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** Trust in stripping—danger.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Trust in stripping arises from a proper position.\n\n**Top Six:** Drawing out joy.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Top Six drawing out joy lacks brilliance.\n\nDui is the marsh. Fang Shihua said: \"Twin marshes form Dui. Dui means joy. Two marshes adjoining, two joys trusting—this is the Way of teacher and friend.\" The hexagram extols this Way to the point of moving Heaven and humanity, spurring the people to effort. Yet how is this achieved? Through friendship alone. Pervading the Five Bonds, all actions are deliberated, rectifying ruler and minister, so that all above and below become teacher and friend. Though this hexagram Dui derives its image from a single yin line, yin softness is not upright—how could it bring smooth progress? Thus, the hexagram speaks of \"beneficial steadfastness,\" and the *Zhuan* states: \"Firmness within and softness without—joy brings benefit through steadfastness.\" Only firmness within ensures steadfastness. Only firmness within with softness without explains why the four yang lines excel. Without firmness, there is no steadfastness; without steadfastness, misfortune follows—this is why the two yin lines falter. Observing the six lines, the meaning of friendship becomes clear.\n\nThe first line embodies joy and is called \"harmonious,\" while the fourth also embodies joy yet is termed \"deliberating\"—deliberation precludes harmony. At the outset of friendship, before faults emerge, all is pure harmony, hence it is struck as \"harmonious.\" Is this not the time when Master Liu of the Willow first emerged into the world? The weight of righteousness and the joy of reunion reside in the First Nine—stepping beyond the door, a single day’s fellowship. The fourth, however, suffers from the excesses of harmony, finding peace only through restraint. It does not delight in \"harmonious joy\" but rejoices in \"deliberating joy\"—does this not diverge from Bo Yi and Shu Qi’s remorse at blocking the horse? If one merely harmonizes light and blends dust, why seek friends at all? For this reason, both benefit. Not only can Liu Xia Hui remain unyielding before the Three Dukes, but even the sons of Mount Shouyang ultimately set aside old grievances—such is the mutual illumination of the first and fourth lines.\n\nThe second and fifth lines also mutually illuminate. Nine in the Second, firm and centered, directly trusts its intent, finding joy in sincerity. If joy arises from trust, how could it be false? Regret stems from joy, yet the second has no joy—how could regret arise? Thus, it aligns with the fifth. The fifth, receiving this, shares its firmness and centeredness, its trust and sincerity. Though the second’s direct pursuit of its intent seems to strip the fifth, the fifth trusts in this stripping. To be stripped yet accept it seems perilous and unbearable—yet its position is not properly aligned. Without this, how could one befriend a minister? Is this not like King Gaozong’s timely rain or Fu Yue’s salt and plum?\n\nThe third and top lines also mutually illuminate, yet their people are unworthy. The third seeks to draw near, using joy as its lure. The top follows, using joy to amplify its light. This is the exchange of marketplace dealings, the demeanor of flattery. Rare in ancient and modern times, yet still called \"my teacher, my friend\"—is this not lamentable? This hexagram exhaustively depicts the conditions of friendship, yet within it lies the great person. The great person seeks only to rectify themselves, not to rectify others, yet all friends are encompassed in their all-embracing care. Those who \"deliberate joy\" cannot avoid restraint, while those who \"harmonize joy\" verge on irreverence. Only Nine in the Fifth’s trust in stripping, unperturbed by danger, approaches this ideal.\n\n**Appendix:**\nHu Yizhi said: \"It is not called 'joy' (*shuo*) but 'Dui' because the sages’ influence on the world transcends words and speech, hence they remove speech and leave Dui.\"\n\nXiong Guo said: \"The fourth and third lines, though in different positions, remain sharply divided.\"\n\n**Kan (☵) below, Xun (☴) above: Huan.**\nSmooth progress. The king approaches the ancestral temple. Beneficial to ford great rivers, beneficial to be steadfast.\n\n**The *Tuan* says:** Huan—smooth progress. The firm comes and is not exhausted; the yielding attains its position externally and aligns above. \"The king approaches the ancestral temple\"—the king resides at the center. \"Beneficial to ford great rivers\"—riding wood brings success.\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** Wind moves over water—Huan. The former kings, offering to the Supreme Emperor, established temples.\n\n**First Six:** Rescuing with a strong horse—auspicious.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The auspiciousness of First Six lies in compliance.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** Huan flees to its support—regret vanishes.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Huan flees to its support\"—desires are fulfilled.\n\n**Six in the Third:** Huan disperses the self—no regret.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Huan disperses the self\"—the intent lies outward.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** Huan disperses the multitude—supremely auspicious. Dispersing forms a mound—beyond the thoughts of the common.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Huan disperses the multitude—supremely auspicious\"—its brilliance is vast.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** Huan sweats its great proclamation; Huan disperses the king’s dwelling—no blame.\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"The king’s dwelling is without blame\"—it is the correct position.\n\n**Top Nine:** Huan disperses its blood, removing and distancing itself—no blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Huan disperses its blood\"—it distances itself from harm.\n\n**Wind over Water: Huan**\nThe inner trigram is Kun, and one yang line of Qian comes to reside within it, thus generating water and forming Kan. Water arises without end, hence it is said: \"The firm comes and does not exhaust.\" The outer trigram is Qian, and one yin line of Kun attains its position externally, thus forming wind and generating Xun, aligning above with the fifth line. Hence it is said: \"The yielding attains its position externally and aligns above.\" Qian and Kun intermingle, and wind and water arise; wind and water interact, and the great proclamation is made. Thus, \"Huan sweats its great proclamation\"—who but the ruler could do this? Yet Nine in the Fifth, residing at the center, remains unmoved like the wind, gathering spiritual essence to borrow the ancestral temple—how would it dare to proclaim? Yet the great proclamation is made. Thus, it is Six in the Fourth that truly effects \"Huan sweats its great proclamation.\" The ruler issues commands; the wind’s voice is established by him, yet he allows a minister to act in his stead—how could there be no blame? However, this minister is one like Yu, whose teachings resounded to the four seas. With a minister like Yu, one may humbly face south, doing nothing yet governing—would this bring blame to Shun? Hence it is said: \"The king borrows the ancestral temple.\" The king is indeed at the center. To say \"the king is at the center\" is like the North Star dwelling in its place. Commands issue forth in all directions, and the people all comply. Thus, crossing the great river and building boats and oars is due to the fourth line. The people are like water; wind moves over water, and boats sail with the current—what disadvantage could there be? Therefore, though Six in the Fourth disperses, the king truly resides within it. The king does not await dispersion. Hence it is said: \"Huan, the king’s dwelling is without blame.\" If the minister disperses while the king resides, then the one who disperses, though a minister, is in truth the king—what blame could there be? Thus, Six in the Fourth is the master of dispersion, the one who effects it, yet only the fifth line can bring it to fruition. How would the top line dare to claim this? Hence, the fifth line is without blame, for it entrusts responsibility and fittingly borrows the temple to offer sacrifices. The top line must distance itself to avoid blame, for one who receives offerings for great merit fears harm may befall them. Hence it is said: \"Huan, its blood disperses, distancing itself within.\"\n\nThe three yin lines all receive dispersion. The third line resides above water—this is precisely what is meant by \"the face receives the harmonious wind\"—how could it not disperse itself? Only Six in the Fourth, as the master of dispersion, is supremely auspicious. The great cry disperses the multitude—this is the dispersion of private concerns. Thus, water flows downward while wind disperses upward, forming a mound against the current. Hence it is said: \"Huan forms a mound,\" for water levels and does not flow. When the dispersing wind flows, it moves with the current and forms patterns. Hence it is said: \"Huan disperses the multitude.\" This is the great achievement, naturally so—all beyond the thoughts of the common. How could it not be supremely auspicious? How could its brilliance not be vast?\n\nThe First and Second lines employ strength, rushing about with purpose—how could there be no smooth progress or advantage? The initial line of Kan, in relation to horses, has thin hooves, not comparable to a strong horse. Thus, the yielding first line resides below. Therefore, to employ rescue, one must have a strong horse to be auspicious. Hence it is said: \"Rescuing with a strong horse—auspicious.\" Otherwise, it would not comply with receiving dispersion. Nine in the Second, a single yang residing at the center, is like riding wood—this is the wooden support. Since the first line employs a strong horse, the second desires to fulfill its wish—how could it not rush to its support and ride upon the wood? Otherwise, regret would surely follow.\n\nAbove is Xun, below is Kan—wind above, water below. Wind and water interact, dispersing sweat and issuing the great proclamation. This hexagram’s image is like Yao obtaining Shun, and Shun obtaining Yu—no other can match it.\n\nFang Shihua said: \"Kan, in relation to wood, is hard and multivalent, hence the image of rushing to the support.\"\n\n**Water over Marsh: Jie**\n**Jie:** Smooth progress. Bitter restraint is inadmissible—persist in correctness.\n**The *Tuan* says:** Jie brings smooth progress. The firm and yielding are divided, and the firm attains the center. Bitter restraint is inadmissible—persisting in correctness leads to exhaustion. Joy moves through danger; attaining one’s position through restraint brings central correctness and smooth progress. Heaven and Earth are restrained, and the four seasons are completed. Restraint through institutions does not waste resources nor harm the people.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Water over the marsh—Jie. The noble one establishes measures and deliberates virtue and conduct.\n\n**First Nine:** Not going beyond the courtyard—no blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Not going beyond the courtyard\"—knowing what is open and blocked.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** Not going beyond the gate—misfortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Not going beyond the gate—misfortune\"—losing the extremity of the time.\n\n**Six in the Third:** If one does not restrain, there will be sighing—no blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Sighing over lack of restraint\"—who else to blame?\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** Peaceful restraint—smooth progress.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Smooth progress through peaceful restraint\"—following the way above.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Sweet restraint—auspicious; advancing brings esteem.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"The auspiciousness of sweet restraint\"—residing in the central position.\n\n**Top Six:** Bitter restraint—persistence brings misfortune, but regret vanishes.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Bitter restraint persisting in misfortune\"—its way is exhausted.\n\n**Water over Marsh: Jie**\nKan water flows, and Dui marsh receives it. Kan water flows to bring smooth progress, hence Nine in the Fifth, though in Kan, still brings smooth progress. Dui marsh receives it to bring restraint, hence Nine in the Second, though in the marsh, presides over restraint. Yet Dui has an opening above—if the opening is not blocked, though restrained, it is as if unrestrained. Six in the Third is yielding and cannot restrain, thus bringing sighs of misfortune. Nine in the Second is firm but not in its proper position, and fears the reproach of overstepping. Hence the sage speaks twice of its misfortune: its correctness lies in not going beyond the gate—it could go out but refuses to do so.\n\nHere the crux lies in reaching the extreme of lost timing—one could observe the moment and act, yet fails to move.\n\nNow, the trigrams unite as one body, sharing the same marsh in mutual reception. How can one sit idly without thought of blocking or restraining? Thus, the Way of presiding over restraint truly resides in Nine in the Second. Between the second and third lines, one firm and one yielding, Nine in the Second alone is firm and centered—hence the fullness of its responsibility.\n\nAbove, Kan water surges and overflows, no place for restraint. To insist on restraint at such a time is truly bitter, and cannot be called correct. Upper Six, yielding and miserly, bitterly ignorant of the Way of proper restraint, thus bears the warning of misfortune in correctness and the sorrow of exhausted Dao.\n\nHad Nine in the Fifth not been centered and correct in its smoothness, had it not practiced sweet restraint with due measure, allowing the flow to proceed, then the sweetness of Dui marsh would have turned into a bitter sea, its sweet waters transformed into bitterness—misfortune would have been unavoidable. Thus, the Way of smooth restraint lies entirely in Nine in the Fifth. Between the fifth and upper lines, one firm and one yielding, Nine in the Fifth alone is firm and centered—hence the sole attribution of auspicious sweet restraint. Thus it is said: \"Restraint brings smoothness.\"\n\nBitter restraint cannot be correct, for it originally sought to achieve smoothness through restraint. Now, by bitterly insisting on restraint, it leads only to exhaustion and blocked passage—this is not its proper principle.\n\nYet the upper trigram Kan water remains smooth, and smoothness naturally entails restraint. The lower trigram Dui marsh presides over restraint, and restraint naturally ensures flow. Thus, Nine in the Fourth in the upper trigram, following the upper Dao to find peace, speaks of \"peaceful restraint bringing smoothness.\" Smoothness here means the sweet restraint of centered correctness that enables flow.\n\nIn the lower trigram, Initial Nine, though not venturing beyond the gate and courtyard, may sit peacefully without blame. Without blame means knowing that there are those who manage flow and blockage, thus avoiding fault. Flow has five, blockage has two—Nine in the Second restrains them. Nine in the Fifth sweetens them, while Initial Nine and Nine in the Fourth merely enjoy the results—is this not fitting?\n\n**Appendix**\nLiu Yongxiang says: Restraint, though correct in principle, if bitter, becomes misfortune even in correctness. Once restraint is taken as correctness, how can one regret it? Thus it is said: \"Regret vanishes\"—this is reproach, not approval.\n\nAlas! Those who take frugality and austerity as great virtues, who pride themselves on hardship and thrift, would they ever admit their bitter restraint as wrong and regret it? Among ten thousand, scarcely one can regret their own bitter restraint—calling it \"regret vanishes\" is fitting.\n\nIn this hexagram, firm and yielding are divided, with the firm attaining the center: one yielding line from Kun is placed at the top of the lower trigram to form Dui marsh, and one firm line from Qian is placed in the center of the upper trigram to form Kan water.\n\n**Wind over Marsh: Zhong Fu**\n\"Pig and fish: auspicious. Beneficial to ford great rivers. Beneficial in correctness.\"\n*The Image* says: Zhong Fu: yielding within while the firm attains the center. Joyful and yielding, sincerity transforms the state. \"Pig and fish: auspicious\"—sincerity extends even to pigs and fish. \"Beneficial to ford great rivers\"—riding an empty wooden boat. Zhong Fu with beneficial correctness responds to Heaven.\n\n*The Image* says: Wind over marsh: Zhong Fu. The noble one discusses lawsuits and delays executions.\n\n**Line Statements**\n**Initial Nine:** \"Trust in anticipation: auspicious. With other matters, no peace.\"\n*The Image* says: Initial Nine’s trust in anticipation is auspicious—its will has not changed.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** \"A crane calls in the shade, its young responds. I have fine wine, I share it with you without end.\"\n*The Image* says: \"Its young responds\"—this is the heart’s desire.\n\n**Six in the Third:** \"Encountering an enemy, now drumming, now ceasing; now weeping, now singing.\"\n*The Image* says: \"Now drumming, now ceasing\"—its position is not proper.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** \"The moon nearly full, the horse’s mate lost—no blame.\"\n*The Image* says: \"The horse’s mate lost\"—cutting ties to ascend.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** \"Sincerity in bonds—no blame.\"\n*The Image* says: \"Sincerity in bonds\"—its position is correct and proper.\n\n**Upper Nine:** \"Cock’s crow reaching heaven—correctness brings misfortune.\"\n*The Image* says: \"Cock’s crow reaching heaven\"—how can this last?\n\n**Wind over Marsh: Zhong Fu**\nZhang Zai says: Zhong Fu: above, Xun wind acts; below, Dui joy receives it—there must be transformation through resonance. Sincerity is like a brooding hen, embodying the principle of inevitable birth.\n\nHe also says: The child is transformed by sincerity. Only through Zhong Fu can one transform the child; only through Zhong Fu can one respond to the mother. Thus it is said: \"Zhong Fu with beneficial correctness responds to Heaven.\" To respond to Heaven is correctness—this refers specifically to Zhong Fu’s ability to respond. If it does not respond in reality but merely bears an empty name, it becomes Upper Nine’s cock’s crow. Though it reaches heaven, can heaven transform through sincerity?\n\nThus, the line statement for Nine in the Second says: \"A crane calls in the shade, its young responds. I have fine wine; I share it with you without end.\" Upper and lower forget themselves in this \"you and I,\" the fine wine ungrudgingly given—rereading this line, how is it different from a shared song? It perfectly embodies the *Three Hundred Poems*’ expression of the sage’s sentiment.\n\nThis may show Nine in the Fifth’s \"sincerity in bonds,\" but it is fundamentally because Nine in the Second truly responds to it. Both Nine in the Second and Nine in the Fifth are firm and centered. Firmness in the center is substance; substance enables sincere transformation. Yielding within is emptiness; emptiness makes sincere transformation difficult—yet who could have known otherwise?\n\nWho could have known that in this hexagram Zhong Fu, with yielding within and firmness centered, joyful and yielding, it naturally embodies sincerity and transforms the state? Had it not sincerely responded to Nine in the Fifth, even Upper Nine’s firmness would not escape the flaw of fine sound without substance—why insist on yielding? If it can sincerely respond to Nine in the Fifth, even Six in the Fourth’s yielding can nearly reach fullness and achieve great things—why limit it to firmness?\n\nThus it is said: In Zhong Fu, even the pig and fish are auspicious; it is beneficial to ford the great river. In this hexagram, the third and fourth lines within are both yin, empty and insubstantial—these are the pig and fish, the hollow boat. Now observe Six in the Fourth and Six in the Third: of the same kind, they were once paired as mates, as old rivals. Yet Three, embodying joy without rectitude, loses balance in sorrow and delight; Four thus rejects its impropriety, severs its kindred bond, forsakes its mate and rival, and ascends directly to bear Five—thereby attaining blamelessness. How then does Four’s sincerity transform Five? Can one say that Zhong Fu’s sincerity cannot extend even to pigs and fish?\n\nMoreover, the two yin lines within form the image of central emptiness; by this inner void, riding the compliant qi of Xun, one crosses the hollow boat to ford the great river—how greatly does this benefit Five? Can one say that Zhong Fu cannot bring auspice even to pigs and fish, or that it is not fitting to do so?\n\nThus, speaking of Zhong Fu’s substance: its sincerity transforms Two, as the crane’s call summons its young in harmony. Speaking of Zhong Fu’s utmost: its sincerity transforms Four, as near-perfection dissolves all rivalry. Only when sincerity transforms the state and even pigs and fish are trusted can one verify that nothing lies beyond Zhong Fu’s transforming power. What then remains of distinctions between firm and yielding, empty and full? How could it be confined to the firmness of Initial Nine?\n\nFor Initial Nine, at the hexagram’s beginning, alone finds joy and contentment in self-preservation, reasoning that if it cannot attain the sincerity of Five and recklessly alters its will to follow another, it would be less auspicious than preserving itself. Does it not stir in response to Two, burning incense in anticipation? And by this, Five reaches the fullness of transforming sincerity.\n\nPigs and fish belong to the yin class. In *Gou* (Hexagram 44), \"the fish is enveloped\"; in *Bo* (Hexagram 23), \"Six in the Fifth place strings the fish together.\" *Gou*, *Yingshi* (Hexagram 43), *Daxu*’s Six in the Fifth, and *Jishi* (Hexagram 26) all exemplify this. The crane and the heavens both refer to Five, while its young refers solely to Two. *Xun* (the trigram) represents the chicken, called \"the sound of wings.\" Wang’s edition annotates: \"In yin, it is the second yin.\" Ma Fengyang states: \"*Zhong Fu* (Hexagram 61) resembles the image of a bird covering its eggs. The two yin lines form the shape of a chicken’s feet.\"\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Ji says: \"Wind stirring the marsh embodies the image of *Zhong Fu*. The noble person, embodying Heaven and Earth’s virtue of cherishing life, deliberates on punishments and delays executions—this is the meaning of *Zhong Fu*. When a case is about to be concluded, it is deliberated; when a sentence is about to be carried out, it is delayed, thus fulfilling the human heart. To deliberate on a case is to seek a path from judgment to life; to delay is to seek life within death. Shun’s compassion in punishment, Yu’s tears for the guilty, Tang’s prayers at the net, and Wen’s burial of bones—if these did not arise from the sincerity of the heart, who would be moved by them? The Way of utmost sincerity can tread upon water and fire, melt metal and stone, reach Heaven and Earth, and move humankind—how much more the spirits and gods? The king listens to the Three Dukes, listens to the Minister of Justice, listens to the deliberation of cases—this is the deliberation of punishment. After ten days, the case is reviewed; after twenty days, it is reviewed again; after three months, it is submitted—this is the delay of execution. The deliberation of punishment corresponds to the *Dui* (trigram) image; the delay of execution, to the *Xun* (trigram) image.\"\n\n**Gen below, Zhen above: Xiao Guo (Hexagram 62)**\n*Xiao Guo* (Small Exceeding): Smooth progress, beneficial for constancy. Suitable for small matters, not for great ones. The sound of a flying bird leaves its echo—it is not fitting to ascend, fitting to descend; greatly auspicious.\n\n**The Judgment says:**\n*Xiao Guo* means that small excesses lead to smooth progress. Exceeding in a way that benefits constancy aligns with the movement of the times. The yielding attains the center, hence small matters are auspicious. The firm loses its position and is not central, hence great matters are not suitable. There is the image of a flying bird: the sound of a flying bird leaves its echo—it is not fitting to ascend, fitting to descend; greatly auspicious. Ascending is contrary, descending is compliant.\n\n**The Image says:**\nThunder above the mountain—*Xiao Guo*. The noble person, in conduct, exceeds in reverence; in mourning, exceeds in grief; in use, exceeds in frugality.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Six:** The flying bird brings misfortune.\n**The Image says:** The flying bird brings misfortune—nothing can be done about it.\n\n**Six in the Second Place:** Exceeding one’s grandfather, encountering one’s grandmother; not reaching one’s lord, encountering one’s minister—no blame.\n**The Image says:** Not reaching one’s lord, the minister must not exceed.\n\n**Nine in the Third Place:** If one does not exceed in guarding against it, following may lead to harm—misfortune.\n**The Image says:** Following may lead to harm—how could misfortune be avoided?\n\n**Nine in the Fourth Place:** No blame. Do not exceed, but encounter it. Going forward is dangerous—be ever vigilant. Do not persist in constancy.\n**The Image says:** Do not exceed, but encounter it—the position is not appropriate. Going forward is dangerous—be ever vigilant, for in the end it cannot last.\n\n**Six in the Fifth Place:** Dense clouds, no rain, from my western suburbs. The lord shoots and takes that which is in the cave.\n**The Image says:** Dense clouds, no rain—this is excessive ascent.\n\n**Top Six:** Not encountering, but exceeding it; the flying bird is ensnared—misfortune. This is called disaster and calamity.\n**The Image says:** Not encountering, but exceeding it—this is excessive arrogance.\n\n**Commentary on Xiao Guo:**\nFour yin lines attain their positions, two yang lines lose theirs—this is *Xiao Guo*. The small, having gained their time and position, exceed. How could this not lead to smooth progress? Yet exceeding may bring smooth progress, but lacking constancy is not permissible. Exceeding in a way that benefits constancy aligns with the movement of the times, for the time is ripe for action. The yielding also attains the center, hence small matters are auspicious, and thus it is said to be suitable only for small matters. However, occupying a position and attaining the center, whether as lord or minister, the affairs are great, not small. Only a firm and strong noble person can manage them. Now, the firm has lost its position and is not central. Occupying the upper position without centrality, losing position and authority—though firm and strong, what can be done? Hence great matters are not suitable, and thus it pertains to the small. If small matters can be accomplished, one acts in accordance with the times; if great matters cannot be accomplished, one defers to the noble person and hopes for their assistance. If one can act with sincerity, knowing one’s place and the times, then even if the position of the small exceeds, in reality it leads to smooth progress. Thus it is said that the small exceed and attain smooth progress because of their constancy. Yet the yielding and weak cannot know their place or the times. They refuse to encounter the yang. Now, the two yin lines occupy the center and attain their positions, assuming the roles of lord and minister. Yet those they align with are the two flying birds of the initial and top lines—even if one or two yang lines remain, they naturally retreat in haste. Therefore, the sage, observing the image of flying birds in this hexagram, uses it as a warning: the flying bird leaves its echo—it is not fitting to ascend, fitting to descend; greatly auspicious. When a bird flies upward, it is contrary; when it flies downward, it is compliant. Now, to claim that descending is fitting and ascending is not—though it may seem self-admonition, it is in truth admonition for the two yang lines. How could a firm and strong noble person wait for the yielding and weak to admonish them to leave before bowing their heads and departing? I fear the flying bird will be ensnared, and though it may wish to leave, it will be unable.\n\n**Initial Six**, dwelling below, delights in advancement and reckless ascent—truly a flying bird. Thus the sage strikes it, saying: This is a flying bird. Though it is at the very beginning and below, the omen of misfortune is already formed. How much more when it clings to the four yin lines or climbs to **Top Six**? It is indeed a creature of misfortune—truly nothing can be done about it. For the two yang lines, is it not better to avoid it early? Yet **Nine in the Fourth Place** responds to it and instead attains no blame, for it knows its strength is insufficient to exceed and ultimately meets it well. However, where there is coming, there must be going; where there is going, there must be danger—can one not be vigilant? How could the world tolerate matters of constant danger and perpetual vigilance?\n\nThus it is said: where there is danger in going, one must be vigilant—yet this cannot endure forever. From this it follows: how much better to refrain from action altogether. To refrain is to preserve one’s primordial danger; preserving primordial danger is to maintain constancy and firmness.\n\nAs for **Nine in the Third Place**, though it knows it cannot surpass and thus strives to guard against it, **Top Six** will take this as intentional provocation. Then, failing to measure its own strength, it may seek to destroy it—like Chen Fan or Bao Wu. I know not how much greater the misfortune will be.\n\nFor in the time of *Small Exceeding*, the first and top lines stand in comparison, wielding power and securing position. The firm and strong nobleman has but one move to consider: to refrain. There is no other good strategy. This is what is meant by \"it is fitting to be below and not fitting to be above.\"\n\n**Six in the Fifth Place**, a yin cloud risen high, does not meet with yang. A lone yin cannot complete the image—it becomes \"dense clouds with no rain.\" Thus it is said: \"Dense clouds with no rain, for it has risen above.\" The qi of **Six in the Fifth Place** has already ascended; it is utterly incapable of descending as rain to nourish the people. Though it dwells above the people, in truth it is no different from those below—whether as minister or as matriarch, how can it accomplish anything?\n\nOne master said: Does this not warn the three men who, unable to serve as ancestors, instead honored their matriarchs; unable to serve as rulers, instead honored their ministers? **Six in the Second Place**, yielding and soft, cautiously preserves itself from blame, yet in truth it cannot surpass its ancestor, nor even reach its ruler. Yet it deludes itself into believing it has surpassed its ancestor and reached its ruler—is this not folly?\n\nThe line does not speak of \"surpassing its ruler\" but of \"reaching its ruler,\" for the sage’s single word weighs heavily for rulers of all ages. Thus it is said: \"It does not reach its ruler, for a minister must not surpass.\" Therefore the Master, in the *Image*, specially elucidates this principle to warn all generations.\n\nYet **Six in the Second Place**, like a creature in its burrow, is a small thing unable to take flight. The master, then, knows only to hunt the small creatures in their burrows, unable to mount the dragon and ride the heavens to behold the greatness of humanity. How then can they join together to accomplish anything? For yin does not meet yang—how can the two be completed? Yin seeking yin again—how can it obtain the timely rain of Fu Yue?\n\n**Top Six** has reached the extreme of *Small Exceeding* and is cut off from **Three**; not only does it refuse to meet, but it exceeds it by far. If **Three** does not depart, the flying bird above will soon leave it. As a creature of misfortune, it is no longer like the first—excess brings disaster, excess brings warning. I fear the solitary yang will ultimately find no escape.\n\nAlas! The first and top are creatures of misfortune; the second and fifth are wooden idols. Though there be a Master, what can he do for Ding and Ai? Not serving is the best strategy; tending fields and managing granaries is the middle strategy; serving as Minister of Justice in Lu is the worst. Resigning after three months saves half.\n\nSu Zizhan said: *Small Exceeding* bears the image of a bird. Four yin lines occupy the positions of action, forming its wings. Two yang lines are imprisoned within—its belly and back. The wings wish to fly toward the belly and back, yet cannot restrain the wings; they wish to restrain the belly and back, yet cannot act. Thus, the control of the flying bird lies in the wings.\n\nChao Yidao said: In times when there was the overreaching Mo Ao, there was also Zheng Kaofu, who corrected him by \"walking along the wall.\" In times when there was Zai Yu, who observed short mourning, there was Gao Chai, who corrected him with \"weeping blood.\" In times when there was Guan Zhong, who took three wives and returned with blemish, there was Yanzi, who corrected him by \"rewarding furs.\" Though not following the middle path, they were sufficient to rectify the times and sharpen customs.\n\nBelow *Li*, above *Kan*: *Already Across*. *Already Across*: small prosperity, profit in constancy; at first auspicious, in the end disorder.\n\nThe *Tuan* says: *Already Across*—prosperity, for the small prospers. Profit in constancy, for the firm and yielding are correct and their positions proper. At first auspicious, for the yielding attains the center. In the end, cessation brings disorder—its Way is exhausted.\n\nThe *Xiang* says: Water above fire—*Already Across*. The noble person, mindful of calamity, takes precautions in advance.\n\n**First Nine**: Dragging its wheels, wetting its tail—no blame.\nThe *Xiang* says: Dragging its wheels—rightly no blame.\n\n**Six Two**: The wife loses her hairpin; do not pursue it—it will be recovered in seven days.\nThe *Xiang* says: Recovered in seven days, by the central Way.\n\n**Nine Three**: Gaozong campaigns against Guifang; after three years, he conquers it—petty men must not be employed.\nThe *Xiang* says: After three years, he conquers it—exhaustion.\n\n**Six Four**: The ragged one has tattered clothes; all day on guard.\nThe *Xiang* says: All day on guard—there is cause for doubt.\n\n**Nine Five**: The eastern neighbor slaughters an ox, yet does not receive as much blessing as the western neighbor’s simple offering.\nThe *Xiang* says: The eastern neighbor slaughters an ox, yet does not match the western neighbor’s timely offering. Truly receiving blessing—great fortune arrives.\n\n**Top Six**: Wetting its head—danger.\nThe *Xiang* says: Wetting its head—danger; how can this last long?\n\nIn the hexagram *Already Across*, each instance speaks of \"small prosperity,\" never \"prosperity in smallness.\" Now, *Already Across* speaks of \"small prosperity,\" for prosperity after crossing must be small, not great. If great, it ends in disorder, worse than the initial auspiciousness of the small. Why? The small is *Li*—*Li* is emptiness. The great is *Kan*—*Kan* is cessation.\n\nNow observe: the first line, positioned below the clarity of *Li*, marks the beginning of *Already Across*. Though already crossed, it remains as if uncrossed, with the peril of *Kan* ahead. Wetting the horse’s tail, it drags its wheels, not daring to hastily ford—such is its heart. Could this bring blame? Is there such a principle? Thus, it is rightly without blame. This is the first principle of *Already Across*.\n\nThe second line, with luminous virtue at its center, is free from obstruction. Not only is this self already across, but this heart also crosses with it—body and heart both crossed, truly *Already Across*. As a pure yin, a wife’s image, it was once unobstructed, losing its hairpin. After seven days, the central Way returns. Having once been obstructed, it grasps the cause of losing the hairpin, no longer chasing after scenes of success or splendor, thus preserving *Already Across* forever. Thus, it is said: \"At first auspicious, the yielding attains the center.\" Is not *Already Across*’s small prosperity due to this? How could it resemble the third line’s fondness for grandeur and love of achievement?\n\nNow observe: even the worthy Gaozong could not avoid employing petty men to raise troops and attack. How much less others? Even with a great state’s might, campaigning against the petty Guifang still required three years to conquer. Though conquered, its exhaustion was extreme. Had it not been for Gaozong’s worthiness, how could he have avoided the rise of extravagant ambitions?\n\nThe rise of extravagant desires breeds indolent complacency, and *Already Across* can no longer be preserved—its ultimate disorder is assured. Thus, at the ninth pentagram, seasonal sacrifices are conducted, with grand offerings of livestock to beseech blessings from the divine spirits. Yet how could they know that those who make timely, modest offerings—rather than lavish displays—truly receive such blessings?\n\nFor once the self has attained *Already Across*, stilling the heart becomes easy. The sixth yang line, positioned above the perilous *Kan* (Water), indulges in dissipation and drenches itself—precisely the figure of one who brings final disorder. How could such a state endure?\n\nSome may ask: If this is so, then why is one who remains vigilant all day also counted among those who bring final disorder? The answer: The noble person’s constant vigilance arises from fear that even one person might fail to receive the warmth of their beneficence. Yet if one’s vigilance extends only to the initial garment—merely clothing the destitute—then it amounts to nothing more than charity toward the poor. To obsess over a single garment, to doubt and fear its loss day and night, is laughable. To preserve what need not be preserved, or to fail to preserve what should be preserved—both lead to the same loss of what truly matters. Thus it is said: \"To halt in the end is to invite disorder.\" The act of halting derives from the image of encountering *Kan* and stopping.\n\nFang Shihua observes: *Li* (Fire) means \"adherence.\" It does not resemble *Li* as armor, spears, or weapons; thus, the campaign against the third line is called \"governing darkness,\" and the target is termed *Guifang*. \"Vigilance all day\" arises from riding the culmination of *Li*. *Li* is the female ox. *Li* is bound, and *Kan* is its neighbor—hence the fifth line. It is said: *Kan* neighbors the west, while *Li* neighbors the east. The second line is called \"west,\" neighboring the second through timely use.\n\nHui Gong, frugal and without demands, forever ensures success—thus it is called \"auspicious.\" Is this not the \"initial auspiciousness\"? Yet by the sixth line, *Kan*’s waters have overflowed, and having enjoyed *Already Across*, one knows only feasting and revelry to the end. The noble person drinks in adversity, drinks when awaiting opportunity—to demonstrate composure. But who has heard of drinking after *Already Across*? To indulge in revelry after success is to court sorrow in the end—how could one not drown like a tile soaked in wine?\n\n**Appendix**\nYang Jian says: *Ji* (既) means \"exhaustion.\" *Already Across* means nothing is left unaccomplished. The phrase \"favorable to constancy\" refers to the first, third, and fifth lines—all odd, firm, and unadulterated—while the second, fourth, and top lines are even, yielding, and equally pure. The fifth yang line is properly positioned above the sixth, and the second yin line is properly positioned below; all firm and yielding lines occupy their rightful places. If this is not constancy, what is? *Nuò* (糯), as Zixia writes, is the same as *nuò* (懦, \"weak\"). The *Nei Ze* speaks of the rites for a youth: \"Clothing should not be of silk or *nuò*-fabric.\" The *Shuowen* states: *Nuò* means \"short garment.\" Tattered clothing, like decayed greens, is called *rú* (茹).\n\n**Below Kan, Above Li: Not Yet Across**\n*Not Yet Across*: Prospering, the young fox nearly crosses but soaks its tail—no advantage.\n**The Judgment** says: *Not Yet Across* prospers, for the yielding attains the center. The young fox nearly crosses, yet remains within the center. Soaking its tail brings no advantage, for it cannot continue to the end. Though the lines are not in their proper positions, the firm and yielding respond to one another.\n**The Image** says: Fire above water—*Not Yet Across*. The noble person carefully distinguishes things and assigns them their proper places.\n\n**First Six**: Soaking its tail—regret.\n**The Image** says: Soaking its tail—it knows no bounds.\n\n**Nine in the Second**: Dragging its wheels—constancy brings good fortune.\n**The Image** says: The second yang’s constancy brings good fortune, for it moves rightly from the center.\n\n**Six in the Third**: *Not Yet Across*—advancing brings misfortune, but crossing the great river is favorable.\n**The Image** says: Advancing in *Not Yet Across* brings misfortune, for the position is improper.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth**: Constancy brings good fortune, regrets vanish. With thunderous force, it campaigns against *Guifang*; after three years, it is rewarded by a great state.\n**The Image** says: Constancy brings good fortune, regrets vanish—its will is fulfilled.\n\n**Six in the Fifth**: Constancy brings good fortune, no regrets. The noble person’s radiance—having sincerity, good fortune.\n**The Image** says: The noble person’s radiance—its brilliance is auspicious.\n\n**Top Nine**: Sincerity in drinking wine—no blame. Soaking its head—sincerity loses its rightness.\n**The Image** says: Drinking wine and soaking the head—it knows no moderation.\n\n**Fire and Water: Not Yet Across**\n*Not Yet Across* means not yet having crossed. To hastily attempt crossing without having done so is the folly of the young, who know not the peril’s extremity. This is the meaning of \"the young fox nearly crosses but soaks its tail\"—no advantage, for it cannot continue and thus ends in failure. Like Fu Jian’s million-strong army encamped at the Huai River, it was truly so. For when the self still lies in peril, unable to emerge, yet rashly soaks its tail to cross—what is this if not ignorance of the peril’s extremity?\n\nThe second yang line understands this and alone drags its wheels without crossing. Thus, the line alone speaks of constancy bringing good fortune, and **The Image** reiterates its right conduct—no empty words. The third yin line, though above *Kan*, has not yet left *Kan*; to advance would bring misfortune, and it cannot simply proceed. Yet it ascends to the fourth yang line, which occupies the third position of *Li*. For what it rides upon—now the fifth yin line has sincerity toward the fourth, and the fourth, with thunderous force, campaigns. Though it does not follow the fourth’s trust in the fifth to advance, the fifth gains the fourth’s aid to cross *Kan*, meeting the moment and opportunity. Though the third does not advance, it naturally finds advantage in crossing the great river. Why rush? For where there is a ruler, there must be ministers; where there are ministers, affairs must be accomplished. *Not Yet Across* will ultimately become *Already Across*, and naturally, crossing the great river will be favorable. This is why *Not Yet Across* prospers.\n\nThus it is said: *Not Yet Across* prospers. In the time of *Not Yet Across*, there must naturally be one who can cross. Where there is one who can cross, there must naturally be ministers who can cross. Where there are ministers who can cross, there must naturally come a day when crossing is achieved. Once crossing is achieved, it prospers. Thus it is said: *Not Yet Across* prospers—the yielding attains the center. Yielding yet attaining the center, inwardly radiant with culture, it can thus secure the perilous crossing.\n\nThus, in the fifth line it is said: \"Steadfast and auspicious, free from great regret.\" And further: \"The radiance of the noble one, with sincerity, is auspicious.\" This speaks of the fifth line’s steadfast auspiciousness without regret, truly because its cultured brilliance resides within, possessing the radiance of the noble one. The reason for this radiance of the noble one lies in its ability to hold sincerity toward the nine in the fourth place, its surplus light extending to the fourth—hence its auspiciousness. Therefore it is said: \"The radiance of the noble one, its splendor is auspicious.\" Where there is radiance, there must be splendor; without splendor, its radiance would not be seen.\n\nThus, in the time of *Not Yet Across*, though there be such a luminous ruler, one cannot but lack splendor. One cannot but prosper. Observing this, I see that in the sage’s engagement with the world, there is not a single day that is not a time of *Already Across*, nor a single day without the heart of *Not Yet Across*. There is not a single moment that is not a day of *Not Yet Across*, nor a single day without the thought of crossing. Anxiety may arrive while joy still lingers, or joy may just arrive when anxiety arises again. With joy and sorrow following one another, this is why the sage exerts effort without realizing old age is approaching.\n\nTherefore, *Already Across* and *Not Yet Across* unite as one hexagram, and the Dao of the *Changes* reaches its end. The *Creative*’s ceaseless self-strengthening, diligent all day and vigilant by evening, does so for a reason. As for those who drink wine until their heads are soaked, taking *Already Across* as an excuse for slackening, unaware that *Not Yet Across* follows behind—who are they? They are the ones the sage calls \"those who cannot endure,\" \"those who do not continue to the end.\" The ruler loses the state, the minister loses his house, the commoner loses his life, and the scholar loses his heart. From ancient times to the present, who has escaped this? Alas.\n\nMaster Fang Shihua said: The fox embodies *Kan* (☵, the Abysmal), and *Kan* remains *Not Yet Across*. Only upon reaching *Li* (☲, the Clinging) is it *Across*. Thus the *Commentary* speaks of *Not Yet Across* as offering prosperity. \"The yielding attains the center\" refers to the outer *Li*’s six in the fifth place. \"The young fox nearly crosses\" speaks of not yet emerging, pointing to the inner *Kan*’s initial six. Now, the campaign against Guifang: in *Already Across*, one should refrain from action and guard against three years of exhaustion; in *Not Yet Across*, one should act with awe and hope for three years of reward. *Already Across* warns against stirring up trouble; *Not Yet Across* delights in achievement.\n\nThe fifth of *Li* governs the fourth, and \"holding to constancy brings good fortune and dispels regret\"—the fifth itself should thus \"hold to constancy, good fortune, and no regret.\" The top nine relies on the six in the fifth’s trust to offer sacrifice, and the great enterprise of *Already Across* is feasting and revelry. Yet before long, to soak one’s head in wine is to equal the top six of *Already Across*, and the momentum is bound to fail. Such is the brilliance of trust in the enterprise of *Already Across*—yet how swiftly it reverses! To cross only to lose again—were not the Tang Emperor Ming and others such cases?\n\nMinister Liu Yongxiang said: Heaven-one generates water, Earth-two generates fire. Water and fire are the great functions of Heaven and Earth. *Qian* (☰, the Creative) and *Kun* (☷, the Receptive) thus conclude with *Kan* and *Li*. When *Kan*-water resides below and *Li*-fire above, though they possess the functions of Heaven and Earth, in truth they do not serve one another. *Xian* (☶, Influence) and *Heng* (☳, Duration) thus conclude with *Li* and *Kan*. When water ascends and fire descends, *Kan* and *Li* interact, the heart is at peace, the body is healthy, the state is harmonious—what affair would not be *Already Across*? This is the culmination of Heaven and Earth. How could there be a principle of initial good fortune ending in disorder? Is it not fitting that the Dao of the *Changes* concludes thus?\n\n**Appendix**\nWu Youqing said: In *Not Yet Across*, none of the lines occupy their proper positions. Yet the *Image Commentary* singles out the six in the third place because yin-softness dwells at the extreme of danger.\n\nWang Fusi said: Though the nine in the second place is not in its proper position, it moves with correctness from the center. The six in the fifth is yielding, compliant, and radiant, occupying the honored position. It entrusts matters to the capable without self-exertion, employing martial strength with culture and governing hardness with softness—truly the brilliance of the noble person. To entrust things to the capable without doubt is to make others exert their utmost, and success is thus achieved. Hence it is said: \"With trust, good fortune.\"\n\nYang Tingshu said: The six in the fifth encounters the era of *Not Yet Across* yet responds with yin-softness. Yet by holding to constancy it attains good fortune, by sincerity it attains further good fortune, and by brilliance it attains yet further good fortune—why? The six in the fifth embodies *Li*. *Li* in Heaven is the sun; on Earth, it is fire. The sun in summer grows ever hotter, and fire at night burns ever brighter. The six in the fifth’s radiance is so abundant that it can empty its center to illuminate all, while the hundred officials stand firm in sincerity and trust. How could worthy talent fail to sweep away great peril and transform an era of primal difficulty into a time when *Not Yet Across* becomes *Already Across*? Possessing the fullness of threefold good fortune without a trace of regret or blame—what doubt could remain?\n\n*This concludes the third scroll of the Lower Canon of the* Yi Yin.",

Thus it is vigilant all day, ever watchful in its time—though perilous, it incurs no blame.\nNine in the fourth place: doubly firm yet not centered, neither in heaven above, nor in the field below, nor among people in the middle. Thus it \"perhaps\" acts. \"Perhaps\" means hesitation—yet it incurs no blame.\n\nThe great person harmonizes their virtue with heaven and earth, their brightness with the sun and moon, their order with the four seasons, their auspices and omens with spirits and gods.\nPreceding heaven, heaven does not oppose; following heaven, they uphold the celestial seasons. If even heaven does not oppose, how could they be matched by mere humans? Or equaled by ghosts and spirits?\n\n\"Excess\" speaks of knowing advance but not retreat, knowing existence but not demise, knowing gain but not loss. Is this not the sage alone? Who else knows advance and retreat, existence and demise, yet never loses their correctness?\n\nQian is heaven. How great is Qian’s primal power—all things rely on it for their beginning. Having relied on it to begin, they must rely on it to end. If not for Qian’s primal power governing heaven, what else could it be?\n\nHeaven is but one thing among the myriad, yet without Qian’s primal power to govern it, how could it move clouds and send down rain, allowing all beings to flow and communicate, taking form and flourishing as they do? Thus it is said: How great is Qian’s primal power.\n\nPeople merely fail to comprehend Qian’s Way in its beginning and end—hence they do not know the greatness of Qian’s primal power. If one could but understand this, they would see that the six positions of the hexagram are all already complete in their time—it is only a matter of riding the moment to act.\n\nThus, dwelling in the first place, one rides the hidden dragon; in the second, the appearing dragon; in the third, the vigilant dragon; in the fourth, the leaping dragon; in the fifth, the soaring dragon; in the top place, the excessive dragon. All are Qian’s natural transformations—the sage merely rides the time to govern heaven.\n\nEach thing possesses its own Qian’s primal power—this is the rectification of each nature and destiny, which cannot be made identical. The myriad things share one body of Qian’s primal power—this is the preservation of the Great Harmony, which cannot be made different. Thus it is said: \"Thus it is beneficial and steadfast.\"\n\nYet each person rectifies their own Qian’s primal power, each possessing this resource to rise above the common multitude. To attribute the governance of heaven to Qian, the riding of time to govern heaven to the sage, and willingly to rot among the common things—is this not lamentable?\n\nThe preservation of the myriad states in harmony stems from this virtue of Qian’s primal power—how could there be a single day without peace? Yet to take Qian as heaven, the myriad as things, the sage as able to pacify the states, and the states as necessarily pacified by the sage—is this not equally lamentable?\n\nThus it is said: Qian—primordial, flourishing, beneficial, steadfast. These four virtues are ascribed to Qian, yet only \"how great\" is used to praise the primordial—its meaning runs deep.\n\nThe *Wenyan* says: Qian’s primal power is that which begins and flourishes. People see its beginning and flourishing but do not see the beginning of its flourishing. For the beginning of flourishing contains what is beneficial and steadfast—this is the nature of disposition.\n\nHow great is Qian’s primal power—it is surely what all things rely on to begin. Who knows that this beneficial and steadfast quality is also what Qian’s primal power relies on to begin? Thus it is also called Qian’s beginning. Only because it possesses this beginning can it then with perfect beauty benefit all under heaven. Otherwise, how could it be so?\n\nQian’s beginning can with perfect beauty benefit all under heaven without speaking of what it benefits—all under heaven receives it. That Qian’s beginning bestows such beauty yet does not claim its benefit—is this not a great benefit indeed? And who knows that it is precisely this beneficial and steadfast quality that makes it so? Thus it is again praised: How great is Qian’s beneficial steadfastness!\n\nStrong, firm, centered, upright, pure, refined, essence, beauty—though one might strive to describe it fully, there is no adequate comparison. For when disposition follows nature, it becomes the invisible virtue of strength, firmness, centeredness, uprightness, purity, refinement, and essence. When nature follows disposition, even the six lines of this single hexagram, unfolding and extending in all directions, fully express its inexhaustible meaning.\n\nWith six lines, there are six dragons to ride in due season to govern heaven. I know that even heaven does not oppose. Having ridden the six dragons, they naturally gather clouds and send down rain—all under heaven is at peace. How could they fail to benefit all under heaven with perfect beauty?\n\nGenerally, Qian’s virtue is an empty position—what is called \"how great is Qian’s primordial power.\" Heaven, humans, and sages all share it, so it does not distinguish which is heaven, which is human, or which is sage—making clear that they cannot be divided.\n\nQian’s steadfastness is a substantive virtue—what is called nature and disposition. Heaven, humans, and sages all possess it, so it does not distinguish which is nature, which is disposition, which is benefit, or which is steadfastness—making clear that they cannot be separated.\n\nThe *Wenyan* says: The primordial is the chief of virtues. Observing the words of the *Xiang*, there are only the four virtues: primordial, flourishing, beneficial, steadfast. Yet when the Master reads them, why does he elaborate so? When he says \"how great is Qian’s primordial power,\" he has already praised Qian’s primordial—his emphasis lies in the primordial, guiding people to embody the primordial through Qian, so that the four virtues are all subsumed into one.",

      "translated_text": "When it says, \"Qian’s primordial is the beginning and the flourishing,\" and \"beneficial steadfastness is nature and disposition,\" it further praises Qian’s steadfastness—here the emphasis lies in steadfastness, guiding people to understand steadfastness. Yet it also arises from the primordial to encompass the four virtues, which have never ceased to revolve and become one another. This is the Qian of the sage, not something others can partake in.\n\nWhen it says, \"The primordial is what is called good—is this sufficient to describe Qian and Kun?\" If one were rigid and rash yet still called Qian, or weak and ineffectual yet still called Kun, then Heaven would no longer uphold Heaven, and Earth would no longer fulfill Earth. What, then, would we rely upon for sustenance? This is inherently the self-possessed power of the most vigorous and the most yielding—what need is there for supplementation? Thus, the utmost yielding moves with vigor, and the utmost stillness embodies constancy. Earth’s capacity for compliance arises from this, just as Qian’s Dao transforms and each fulfills its nature and destiny. Heaven’s capacity for vigor arises from this: if vigor were merely supplemented by compliance, it would not be true vigor—its use stems from the primordial. If compliance were merely augmented by vigor, it would not be utmost compliance—its use stems from the primordial. Alas, how could this suffice to grasp the true nature of Qian and Kun?\n\nQian and Kun are one. Thus, *Qian* speaks of primordial flourishing, and *Kun* likewise speaks of primordial flourishing. Yet *Qian* speaks of beneficial steadfastness, while *Kun* speaks of the steadfastness of the mare. And not merely a horse, but a *mare*—how does this compare to the dragon’s transformations and soaring flight? Kun alone finds benefit in this because it is Kun’s steadfastness. Therefore, when the noble person sets forth and models themselves on Kun, they rest solely in the steadfastness of the mare. Thus it is said: \"Steadfastness in tranquility brings good fortune.\" When engaging in affairs, they find benefit solely in the steadfastness of the mare. Thus it is said: \"Benefit lies in eternal steadfastness,\" for it concludes with greatness.\n\n\"Great\" refers to Qian, which concludes with greatness. Only the primordial dares to take the lead, only the primordial dares to stand at the forefront, only the primordial dares to form factions—this is steadfastness. \"Those who take the lead go astray\" and below refers to the steadfastness of the mare. \"Taking the lead\" means acting as Qian, as the master, while we follow—thus we attain the master and benefit the master. Whether west or south, we guard our position, residing in the northeast. Only by following the master does the will remain single-minded and unwavering; by dwelling in tranquility and heeding the master, we attain constancy and avoid confusion. Such is Kun’s beneficial steadfastness—this is primordial flourishing.\n\nHuman life is upright, yet uprightness seems not to be square. Now, to speak of uprightness and also of squareness is because people know only uprightness but not that uprightness inherently possesses squareness. Is not the first thought of a person their upright and unobstructed true nature? Yet as soon as it arises, it is immediately perceived—what was first is upright, and what perceives is also upright. Perception leads to stillness, stillness to squareness. When it emerges, though upright and square are united, their essence is one radiant light. Earth’s nature is vast and deep, Kun’s virtue boundless—it cannot stand alone, which is why the lines speak of both uprightness and squareness.\n\nUprightness is correctness, squareness is righteousness. Correctness is about stillness, righteousness about action. Stillness is reverence—reverence is not deliberate intent but simply inward uprightness. Squareness is righteousness—righteousness is not acquired through imitation but simply through acting with benefit. How could this depend on learning to become beneficial? It is inherently unlearned and yet not unbeneficial—what doubt is there?\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Shi’s explanation: The dragon transforms and acts on its own, while the horse is tamed and used by humans. To be used by humans and also to be a mare is the utmost compliance. Yet utmost compliance without steadfastness falls into depravity, hence the benefit of the mare’s steadfastness.\n\nLi Tufang’s explanation: Utmost compliance is never unsteadfast. Utmost compliance is compliance with Qian. If one complies with Qian, how could one not be steadfast? If one seeks companions, joins factions, or travels southwest, one reverts to yin’s softness. Clinging to yin’s softness, how can one single-mindedly obey Qian’s command and achieve utmost compliance?\n\nAnother explanation: Kun’s Dao can be used by others but cannot act on its own; it can harmonize but cannot initiate. Thus, the noble person benefits from having somewhere to go. Taking the lead leads to confusion and loss of the Way, while following leads to compliance and attaining the master—this is why it is beneficial. West and south are Dui, Li, and Xun—all our companions. East and north are Zhen, Kan, and Gen—none are our companions. Two yin cannot use each other, so one must leave their kind. Breaking from companions and coming to the master resides in the northeast.\n\nLi Tuweng’s explanation: Qian is Kun’s master. As the master, Qian does not need to be sought; seeking it leads to loss, fostering thoughts of gaining companions and failing to single-mindedly obey Qian’s command.\n\nAnother explanation: With six in the second place, one may be called yielding. Uprightness and squareness are what it wishes to express, and when spoken, it is called sincerity. Loyalty perfects sincerity, and sincerity arises from within. Who does not proceed from this righteousness? Thus, the noble person’s loyalty and sincerity endure to the end of their life.\n\nIf one does not yet know this as the utmost but merely knows it as their ordinary words and deeds, not daring to abandon it for life, they too can preserve righteousness and minimize errors. Why? Because their daily diligence fears only not aligning with righteousness. Thus, those who know the utmost hear \"loyalty and reciprocity\" and immediately grasp the One Thread. Otherwise, they may spend their lives upholding loyalty and reciprocity yet never understand what the One Thread means. Therefore, Master Zeng regarded loyalty and reciprocity as the ultimate, while his disciples upheld loyalty and reciprocity to the end of their lives.",

      "translated_text": "This marks the distinction between attainment and non-attainment.\n\nThe Master said: *\"Is there a single word one can practice throughout life? Surely it is reciprocity.\"* How true this is. For scholars, loyalty and reciprocity may indeed be upheld for a lifetime. Yet only when self-realization dawns does one grasp the utmost—this cannot be forced. Alas, must one first embody the *qi* of *qian*—firm, vigorous, centered, upright, pure, and refined—before such attainment is possible? If so, then the *qi* of *kun* surely cannot be spoken of in terms of knowing the utmost.\n\nThe Nine in the Fourth place stands at the apex of *qian*, poised between doubt and certainty. It seems to have grasped the utmost, yet dares not immediately affirm it. If one were to resolve to uphold this for life without finding inner peace, it would be a moment of tentative leaping. Thus, the Master admonishes: *\"Virtue values constancy.\"* Yet now, moving up and down—how can this be called constant? *\"Endeavor values perseverance.\"* Yet now, advancing and retreating—how can this be called persevering? Is it because the words of loyalty and reciprocity are flawed and unworthy of trust? Or must one sever all ties with the common and depart from the herd to become a perfected person? Yet once born among people, how can one stand apart from them?\n\nI say: what matters for the noble person in cultivating virtue and refining conduct is seizing the moment with courage and decisive action. Lingering between doubt and certainty—when will true peace ever come? Without doubt, there is indeed a day of attaining the utmost; but mere doubt—when will there be a moment of stillness? One must decide resolutely in due time to ensure freedom from blame.\n\nThe Nine in the Fifth place is the soaring dragon. Here, virtue, position, and timing—all three are fully realized. There is none more fitting for the world to behold than the great person of Nine Five. Yet Nine Two possesses virtue without position—why is it also called a great person, equally the one whom all things seek to behold? For in the world, only virtue is most noble. When virtue resides within me, how can time or position constrain it? Thus it is said: *\"From the Son of Heaven to the common people, all must take self-cultivation as their foundation.\"* If a commoner possesses the virtue of a ruler, they naturally become a great person worthy of emulation. If one in high position lacks virtue, though they occupy Nine Five, who would seek to behold them? Thus, where virtue resides, time and position are not the measure.\n\nCan we not observe this in our Master? It is asked: *\"If so, then all six lines are dragons—why only the second?\"* Because the dragon’s virtue in the second line is already manifest—what is called *\"dragon virtue in true centrality.\"* This is the dwelling of humanity, the inevitable refuge of the multitude. Thus, though it has not yet ascended to govern heaven, its virtue already pervades all. Though not a ruler, it possesses the virtue of a ruler. Why wait for *\"facing the light to govern\"* before the world becomes radiant?\n\nAs for the other lines, which must seize the moment to advance in virtue and refine their conduct, how can they compare themselves to the second? Thus, the first warns against premature action, recognizing the need for hidden cultivation. The top cautions against excess, lest it lead to the regrets of a dragon soaring too high. As for the third and fourth, if they do not *\"vigilantly fear day and night,\"* they may hesitate in their leaping—these are times for progress, not moments for emulation. Yet if one’s cultivated virtue and conduct are already manifest daily, whether as the second or the fifth, what prevents it? All are equally great persons, equally the ones whom all things seek to behold. What doubt remains?\n\nThe great person’s virtue aligns with heaven and earth. Alas, this is the great person—does Nine Five embody it? Yet the *Wenyan* does not speak of position or lack thereof. Is it truly the fifth, or does Nine Two fulfill it? It does not say *\"soaring\"* for the exalted or *\"manifest\"* for the lowly—how can we know if it is truly the second? My view is that such a person is one whom even heaven does not dare defy—not because they command heaven, but because they harmonize with it. Such a person is one whom even people do not dare defy—not because they stand above all things, but because they bring peace to all nations. Such a person is one whom even ghosts and spirits do not dare defy—not because they wield divine or spectral powers, or transform, expand, contract, hide, soar, summon clouds, or bring rain, but because it is so without knowing why.\n\nAlas, this is the great person—something we all share. How dare we shirk responsibility onto others?\n\nNine Five is the soaring dragon. Yet the Master speaks of *\"resonant voices and kindred qi, each following its kind.\"* Those not of the same kind may not wish to behold them. The third and fourth, the first and top—all occupy the six positions, yet remain unaware of one another. Thus, there is only one great person: Nine Two. Yan Hui was but one who approached it. Alas, the multitude is vast—one is not too few. Yet with Yan Hui’s passing, none remained. How poignant is the Master’s lament for the interval between the second and fifth!\n\nTo know when to advance and when to retreat is to be a sage, to never lose correctness, and to avoid excess. Thus, though times may reach excess, the sage never does. Hence, the repeated emphasis on the sage is meant to encourage, not like today’s mediocre and vulgar readers who cherry-pick passages to serve their own ends.\n\nNine is the active expression of *qian*, so all lines of *qian* use nine. All nines in *qian* are dragons, hence *qian*’s nine is called the *\"dragon of the herd.\"* Yet the dragon of the herd can be seen, while the head of the herd’s dragon cannot. Without seeing this, one cannot become a dragon. Thus, those who use nine must truly perceive the head of the herd’s dragon, and naturally they will rise above all things, bringing peace to all nations. Naturally, they will seize the moment to ride heaven, and the cosmos will lie in their hands. Naturally, they will illuminate the beginning and end of the *qian* Dao, unifying heaven with a single origin, and all transformations will arise from within.\n\n---",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: \"To employ the nine is to perceive the head of the herd’s dragon—auspicious.\" Auspiciousness is the *yuan* (origin), the *heng* (prosperity), the *li* (benefit), and the *zhen* (constancy). To employ the nine, the virtue of heaven cannot be made the head; if there were a head, it would not be called the virtue of heaven. Therefore it is said: \"When the origin of *qian* employs the nine, the celestial principle is revealed.\" Su Zizhan said: \"The origin of *qian* takes the head as the celestial principle.\" Alas, how perfect!\n\n**Appendix**\nZhuangzi (#6) said: \"The *Yi* (Changes) speaks of the Dao of yin and yang.\"\nYang Xiong said: \"The trigrams of Fuxi and the hexagrams of King Wen, with the six lines appended by Confucius—who arranged their images and composed their words—revealed the hidden workings of heaven and earth and established the foundation of all things.\"\nChen Tunan said: \"The August Sovereign Fuxi first drew the eight trigrams and doubled them into sixty-four, without setting down written words, allowing the people of the world to silently observe their images. If one can accord with the images, fortune and misfortune will respond; if one violates them, fortune and misfortune will reverse. This was the teaching without words of Fuxi.\"\nShao Yaofu said: \"The *Yi* is the tool by which the sage grows the noble and diminishes the petty. When the noble grows, it is checked before it comes to be; when the petty diminishes, it is sealed before it comes to be. One diminishes, one grows; one opens, one closes—all is harmoniously united in the origin, near and far. If not for the utmost spirit of heaven and earth, who could partake in this?\"\nZhou Maoshu said: \"The essence of the sage is revealed in the drawing of the trigrams; the sage’s profundity is expressed through the trigrams. Without the trigrams, the sage’s essence could not be seen; without the subtle trigrams, the sage’s profundity could scarcely be fully heard. How could the *Yi* be merely the source of the Five Classics? It is the mystery of heaven, earth, ghosts, and spirits.\"\nQiu Zhongshen said: \"The three lines of *qian* are the ancestors of all writing for ten thousand generations. The four words *yuan*, *heng*, *li*, and *zhen* are the origin of all principles of meaning for ten thousand generations. In heaven, they are spring, summer, autumn, and winter; in man, they are benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom; flowing between heaven and earth, they are the *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi* (great eras).\"\nCai Zimu said: \"The first line, hidden, corresponds to Yanzi—do not act, and virtue is perfected. The second line, emerging, corresponds to Confucius—abiding in season, radiant in culture. The third line, cautious, corresponds to Gao, Kui, Hou Ji, and Xie—overcoming hardship without peril. The fourth line, leaping, corresponds to Tang and Wu—abiding in obscurity yet ultimately transforming. The fifth line, soaring, corresponds to Yao and Shun—sagely virtue shining far and wide. The top line, overreaching, corresponds to Yi and Zhou—abiding in excess yet not losing correctness. These six lines, when distinguished, each accord with their time; when unified, they return to the great illumination of the sage.\"\nSu Shi commented: \"Those who soar today were once hidden—who among them is not a great person? Again he said: \"To abide in this, how could it be the way of endless regret?\" Thus, what is spoken of is not necessarily so. Again he said: \"When yin and yang harmonize, things are born.\" He said: \"Without prosperity, the auspicious rite is partial and stagnant, not in accord with righteousness; without benefit, it is harsh and discordant, not harmonious.\"\nLuo Yizheng said: \"The third line, situated between the two *qian*, bears the image of ceaseless activity; at the end of the lower *qian*, it bears the image of day ending and evening coming. The third line, at the top of the lower trigram, is a perilous position. Yet because it is ceaselessly active by day and vigilant by night, it incurs no blame.\"\nShi Shoudao said: \"Heaven is supremely high—how could it descend to interact with earth and thereby move the four seasons and give birth to the hundred things? The ruler is supremely honored—how could he not descend to connect with the people and thereby embrace the ten thousand states and govern the hundred officials? Thus, one must not reach excess.\"\nWang Ji said: \"*Qian* is the virtue of heaven. The numinous earth (#7) congeals to form the heart. The origin of desire is the original substance of the heart. This is what is called *qian*—the movement of heaven’s virtue circles the heavens day and night, unceasing through all ages. The alternation of the sun and moon, the intermingling of the four seasons, do not harm or conflict because of their strength. The movement of sagely virtue penetrates day and night, unceasing throughout life, in harmony with heaven. Those below the worthy cannot embody the origin of desire; their desires do not necessarily sink into excess, but wherever intention turns, that is desire. Reduce it again and again, until there is none. Man is determined by heaven. The strength of the noble is modeled on heaven.\"\nI have examined the celestial patterns: the movement of heaven has constant measure yet no stopping mechanism—does heaven not have a body? It takes the stars that cling to it as its body, like a support. For the North and South Poles are aligned, the North high and the South low; when observed through a tube, the pole is centered. One star rotates most closely, never leaving the tube—this is the pivot star, the hub of heaven’s axis. The body of heaven does not move; it is not that it does not move, but that its rotation does not depart from the pole, just as the opening and closing of a hinge does not depart from the socket—it has never moved. Thus it is said: \"The mandate of heaven is profoundly unceasing.\" That by which heaven is heaven is that, without distinction of far or near, high or deep, it receives the mandate like an echo. This is the pivot of creation, the secret treasury transmitted by a thousand sages.\nThe Confucians avoid speaking of emptiness and stillness. Yet when the Master discussed the principle of stimulus and response in *Xian* (Hexagram 31), he spoke of it in detail—why? Because all stimuli in the world arise from stillness, and their responses all originate in emptiness. Emptiness adapts to change; stillness spiritually responds—without thought, without consideration. Thus all movements under heaven are unified: Yao’s centrality, Shun’s subtlety, Wen’s solemnity, Kong’s silence, Yan’s foolishness, Zhou’s stillness—all are this thing.\nScholars of the world, clinging to canonical essentials, think and become benighted. The so-called body of emptiness and stillness is why the learning of the sages is not understood, and creation nearly comes to a halt.\n\n**Hexagram 2: Kun (☷☷)**\n*Kun*: *Yuan heng*, beneficial for the constancy of the mare.",

      "translated_text": "Straightness is its correctness, squareness is its righteousness. The noble person rectifies the inner with reverence and squares the outer with righteousness. When reverence and righteousness are established, virtue is not solitary. Straightness, squareness, and greatness—without practice, how could they not be beneficial? Thus, one does not doubt one’s conduct.\n\nThough yin possesses beauty, it contains it to follow the king’s affairs, not daring to complete them. This is the Way of Earth, the Way of the Wife, the Way of the Minister. The Way of Earth does not complete but instead ensures continuity.\n\nHeaven and Earth transform, and plants flourish; Heaven and Earth close, and the worthy withdraw. *The Yi* says: “Tying up the sack—no blame, no praise.” This speaks of caution.\n\nThe noble person, centered in yellow and penetrating principle, occupies the correct position and embodies form. Beauty resides within and flows through the four limbs, manifesting in undertakings—this is the perfection of beauty. When yin doubts yang, there must be conflict. For it suspects excess in yang, hence it is called “dragon.” Yet it has not departed from its kind, hence it is called “blood crow.” That which is dark and yellow is the blending of Heaven and Earth—Heaven is dark, Earth is yellow.\n\n*Kun* is Earth, *Qian* and *Kun* establish their natures—one firm, one compliant. Firmness cannot become compliance, just as compliance cannot become firmness. To demand compliance of the firm or firmness of the compliant is to lose their essential natures. The two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun* would then be contrary to the proper order, not the true principle of Heaven’s supremacy and Earth’s subordination.\n\n*Qian* and *Kun* establish their positions—one husband, one wife. The husband cannot become the wife, just as the wife cannot become the husband. To demand the wife’s role of the husband or the husband’s role of the wife is to invert their proper places. The two hexagrams would then be out of position, not the true Way of the lord’s supremacy and the minister’s subordination.\n\nThus, above is Heaven, below is Earth—this is the *Qian* and *Kun* of the world. One husband, one wife—this is the *Qian* and *Kun* of every household. Their positions are fixed, so they cannot be reversed as a constant. Their natures are fixed, so they cannot be exchanged in function. When use matches ability, ability suits its use. This is why the sage first establishes *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nOtherwise, if a divine dragon were a mare, it would be of no use as a dragon; its soaring and bearing heavy loads over great distances would be mocked. If a mare were a divine dragon, it would be of no use as a horse; its carrying burdens and summoning clouds to bring rain would be beyond its ken. *Qian* and *Kun* alike—if not employed according to their strengths, both become useless. How much more so for humans?\n\nThus, the sage distinguishes *Qian* and *Kun* and expounds on them in detail. Yet世俗的儒者, drawing snakes and adding feet, claim that firmness without compliance leads to impetuousness and failure, while compliance without firmness leads to weakness and collapse. Alas! If this were true, how could they still be called *Qian* and *Kun*?\n\nIf one were impetuous and incapable of accomplishment yet still called *Qian*, or weak and ineffectual yet still called *Kun*, then Heaven would not uphold Heaven, Earth would not fulfill Earth, and we humans would have nothing to rely upon. They do not realize that this is precisely what the most firm and most compliant naturally possess—what need is there for supplementation?\n\nThus, utmost softness moves with firmness, utmost stillness embodies square virtue—this is how Earth achieves compliance. The Way of *Qian* transforms, each fulfilling its nature and destiny—this is how Heaven achieves firmness. If firmness were supplemented with compliance, it would not be true firmness; it would be of no use as firmness. If compliance were supplemented with firmness, it would not be true compliance; it would be of no use as compliance. Alas! How could this grasp the true nature of *Qian* and *Kun*?\n\n*Qian* and *Kun* are one, so *Qian* says “originating and prospering,” and *Kun* also says “originating and prospering.” But *Qian* says “beneficial to constancy,” while *Kun* says “beneficial to the constancy of the mare.” And not just any mare—it specifies *the* mare, contrasting with the dragon’s transformations and soaring. *Kun* alone finds benefit in this because it is *Kun*’s constancy.\n\nThus, when the noble person goes forth and models *Kun*, they rest in the constancy of the mare. Hence it is said: “The woman’s constancy is auspicious.” When engaged in affairs, only the constancy of the mare is beneficial. Hence it is said: “Beneficial for eternal constancy, ending in greatness.” “Great” refers to *Qian*—ending in greatness means not daring to lead, not daring to take precedence, not daring to form cliques—this is constancy. “First lost” and below refers to the benefit of the mare’s constancy. The first is *Qian*, the lord, while we follow—thus finding the lord and benefiting the lord. Whether west or south, we guard the northeast, for we follow the lord alone. With single-minded devotion and no duality, dwelling in peace and heeding the lord, we attain constancy without confusion—this is *Kun*’s beneficial constancy, and thus it is “originating and prospering.”\n\nHuman life is straight—one might think straightness excludes squareness. Yet we speak of both straightness and squareness because people know straightness but not that straightness inherently possesses squareness. Is not the first thought of a person their straight, unobstructed true nature? Yet as soon as it arises, it is perceived—what was first is straight, and perception is also straight. Perception halts, halting is square. When it emerges, though straight and square are united, their essence shines as one.\n\nEarth’s nature is vast and yielding, *Kun*’s virtue is boundless—how could it be solitary? Thus, the lines speak of both straightness and squareness. Straightness is correctness, squareness is righteousness. Correctness is for halting, righteousness is for acting. Halting is reverence, but reverence is not deliberate—it is simply the inner straightness. Squareness is righteousness, but righteousness is not forced—it is simply acting for what is beneficial. How could this depend on learning and practice to be beneficial?",

      "translated_text": "Indeed, it is not through practice that one fails to attain primal benefit—what doubt could there be?\n\n**Appendix: Su Shi’s Explanation**\nThe dragon is that which transforms and acts of its own accord. The horse is that which is tamed and put to human use. To be used by others and yet be a mare is the utmost in equine compliance. Yet such perfect compliance, if not steadfast, falls into deviance—thus the benefit lies in the mare’s steadfastness.\n\n**Li Tuhe’s Remarks**\nUtmost compliance is never unsteadfast. Utmost compliance is compliance with *Qian*. Having complied with *Qian*, how could one not be steadfast? If one joins with allies, associates with one’s kind, or travels southwest, then by yielding to yin one clings again to yin—how can one wholeheartedly heed *Qian*’s command and attain the utmost greatness?\n\n**Further Explanation**\nThe Way of *Kun* may be employed by others but cannot act on its own; it may harmonize but cannot initiate. Thus, the noble person benefits from having somewhere to go. To precede is to go astray and lose the Way; to follow is to comply and fulfill one’s aspirations—this is why it is beneficial. West and south are *Dui*, *Li*, and *Xun*—all our allies. East and north are *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen*—none of them our allies. Two yin forces cannot employ each other, so one must depart from one’s kind. To sever ties with allies and come forth is to be bound to restraint.\n\n**Li Tuweng’s Remarks**\n*Qian* is *Kun*’s master. *Qian* being the master, one need not seek it—seeking it only leads to loss, giving rise to thoughts of gaining allies. Then one cannot wholeheartedly heed *Qian*’s command.\n\n**Further Explanation**\nWith six in the second place, one may be called yielding. But how does one attain straightness, squareness, and greatness? It is said: the second six is the utmost in compliance. The noble person’s compliance—what else could it be? It is simply following principle without self-interest.\n\n**Tuweng’s Remarks**\nUtmost softness moves with hardness; utmost stillness embodies squareness. The Master has already explained this perfectly—there is no need to rephrase it as \"following principle without self-interest.\" It is precisely because of its utmost softness that it attains utmost hardness; precisely because of its utmost stillness that it attains utmost squareness. Softness is possible, but utmost softness is not. Alas, how perfect!\n\n**Further Explanation**\nDwelling at the junction of above and below, neither position is secure. *Qian* is secure above, for it sees danger in not yet having reached the top—thus the third nine harbors the anxiety of evening vigilance. *Kun* is secure below, for it finds difficulty in first reaching above—thus the fourth six exercises the caution of tying one’s sack. For yin to advance to the third place may still be steadfast, but to reach the fourth is perilous. Thus, one binds and seals oneself to seek freedom from blame and primal praise. Blame and praise are what people cannot escape: emerging from blame, one enters praise; shedding praise, one is ensnared by blame. Blame leads to guilt, and praise leads to suspicion—how severe is the difficulty of attaining primal praise!\n\n**Further Explanation**\nWhen it transforms, even grasses and trees flourish. When it closes, even the worthy withdraw.\n\n**Tuweng’s Remarks**\nReading this, one may weep in sorrow.\n\n**Further Explanation**\nYellow is the color of the center, present only when principle is fully realized—it is the adornment beneath the lower garment. If it were yellow but not the lower garment, it would belong to the upper body. If it were the lower garment but not yellow, it would not be the lower body in its proper position. Now, occupying the correct position in the doubled *Kun* and dwelling at the center of the lower body, it is called the lower garment to clarify its lower position and yellow to clarify its centrality. For pattern in the *Yi* arises from intermingling. If yin and yang were each absolute, how could there be pattern?\n\n**Tuweng’s Remarks**\nAbsolute unity itself gives rise to pattern. *Kun* does not value pattern—what it values is pattern within, the color of the central yellow. If pattern is within, why must it depend on intermingling to exist?\n\n**Cheng Zhengshu’s Remarks**\nThe southwest is the direction of yin; the northeast, the direction of yang. Yin must follow yang, abandoning its own kind.\n\n**Zhu Zhonghui’s Remarks**\nIn this hexagram, all three lines are even, hence its name *Kun* and its image of earth. Doubling it yields *Kun* again, signifying the utmost in pure yin compliance. It is further said: the fifth six, with yin occupying the honored position, embodies the virtue of central compliance, manifesting both internally and externally—thus its image is such, and its oracle is supremely auspicious.\n\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* records that when Nan Kuai planned rebellion, he divined and obtained this line, taking it as greatly auspicious. Zifu Huibo said: \"If it is a matter of loyalty and trust, it may be so; otherwise, it will surely fail. Outward strength and inner warmth are loyalty. Harmony in leading with steadfastness is trust. Thus it is said: *Yellow lower garment, primal auspiciousness*—yellow is the color of the center, the adornment beneath the garment, the chief of all virtues. Without loyalty, one cannot attain its color; without reverence, one cannot attain its adornment; without goodness, one cannot reach its extremity. Moreover, the *Yi* cannot be used to divine peril. If any of these three are lacking, even if the divination is correct, it is not yet so.\" Later, Kuai indeed failed.\n\n**Jin Rubai’s Remarks**\n\"First lost\" is one phrase; \"later attains the master and benefits\" is another. The master of yin and yang is yang first, yin later—this is the constant principle. If yin precedes, it reverses the constant and goes astray; if it follows, it attains its master and benefits. Benefit is like compliance. Thus it is said: \"Following, it attains the constant.\" It is also said: \"Later attaining the master, it has constancy.\" Some scholars take \"attains the master and benefits\" as a single phrase, thus reading \"later attains the master and has constancy,\" omitting the word \"benefits.\" But then how could \"following, it attains the constant\" also omit it? Yin ought to follow yang—can it cling to its own kind? To lose allies is like *Tai*’s \"allies lost\"—abandoning one’s allies to follow yang, thus auspicious.\n\n**Zheng Zhifu’s Remarks**\nThe image of *Qian* reveals King Wen’s virtue in founding Zhou; the image of *Kun* reveals King Wen’s heart in serving Yin.\n\n**Zhou Yan’s Remarks**\nThe first nine of *Qian* says: \"Do not act,\" guarding its subtlety. The first six of *Kun* immediately says: \"Firm ice arrives,\" warning of its excess.",

      "translated_text": "Liu Junbo remarked: The third six, with yin enveloping yang, takes the image of \"containing brilliance.\" The fourth six, occupying the fourth position as a yin line, takes the image of \"tying the sack.\" The sack’s emptiness at its center mirrors the heavy yin’s knotted closure. He further said: Treacherous and ambitious ministers brazenly seize power. Though the ruler may be weak and benighted, they do not yield. Stiffened corpses and flowing blood—such is the inevitable outcome. \"Treading on frost, firm ice arrives\"—this is precisely the warning. Hu Zhonghu said: \"Its blood is dark and yellow,\" both sides suffer injury. Though yin may reach its extreme, how could it harm yang alone? You Dingfu said: *Qian* is pure yang; when yang reaches its extreme, it becomes overbearing. *Kun* is pure yin; when yin reaches its extreme, it wages war. If they do not transform, overbearing brings disaster, war brings injury—neither can be avoided. Yang Jingzhong said: When yin ascends to the sixth, yang is nearly extinguished. Yet though yang is faint, its name and position remain—it cannot be obliterated. At such a time, people see only the sixth; who still recognizes yang? The sage deplores its usurpation of yang, thus specially invokes the dragon to show that the dragon still dwells in the human heart, never to be forgotten or slighted. Blood is a yin substance; calling it \"blood\" clarifies that the sixth has not yet departed from the category of ministers. Both yin and yang are injured—not yang alone. Thus the sage uses this to temper the hearts of overbearing rulers.\n\n**On \"Using Six\" and \"Using Nine\"**\nThe *Yi* combines the Three Powers and doubles them, forming hexagrams with six lines—is this not \"using six\"? He further said: Six is nothing other than the Dao of the Three Powers. With six and three, is this not \"using nine\"?—*Note appended by Wang Benhe of Xin’an.*\n\n**Hexagram 3: Tun (屯) – Difficulty at the Beginning**\n*Below Zhen (震), above Kan (坎).*\n**Tun:** Primordial, pervasive, beneficial, and steadfast. Do not act; there is somewhere to go—it is beneficial to establish lords.\n**The Image says:** *Tun*—hard and soft first meet and difficulty arises, movement within peril. Greatly pervasive and steadfast. The movement of thunder and rain fills all; heaven creates in the unformed. It is fitting to establish lords and not rest.\n**The Image says:** Clouds and thunder—*Tun*. The noble person thereby orders and weaves.\n\n**First Nine:** Hesitating; beneficial to dwell in steadfastness, beneficial to establish lords.\n**The Image says:** Though hesitating, its aspiration is rightly conducted. Placing the noble below the lowly—greatly gaining the people.\n\n**Second Six:** Entangled and beset, riding horses in disarray. Not bandits but marriage—if the woman is steadfast, she does not conceive; after ten years, she conceives.\n**The Image says:** The second six’s difficulty comes from mounting the firm. After ten years, she conceives—returning to the norm.\n\n**Third Six:** Pursuing deer without a guide, entering the forest’s depths. The noble person nearly does not desist—going brings regret.\n**The Image says:** Pursuing deer without a guide is to follow game. The noble person desists—going brings regret and exhaustion.\n\n**Fourth Six:** Riding horses in disarray, seeking marriage. Going is auspicious; nothing is unfavorable.\n**The Image says:** Seeking and going—clarity.\n\n**Ninth Five:** Difficulty storing its richness. Small steadfastness is auspicious; great steadfastness is inauspicious.\n**The Image says:** Difficulty storing its richness—its bestowal is not yet radiant.\n\n**Top Six:** Riding horses in disarray, weeping blood in streams.\n**The Image says:** Weeping blood in streams—how can this last?\n\n**Hexagram 3: Water over Thunder – Tun**\nFang Shihua said: Following *Kun*, this hexagram is *Tun*. What is *Tun*? *Zhen* brings one yang to dwell below *Kun*—thus hard and soft first meet. Yet *Kan* and *Li* arise before it—thus hard and soft first meet and difficulty arises. What else could this be but *Tun*? *Tun* is the re-creation of *Qian* and *Kun*, the true lord’s resurgence in the unformed time. Now, one yang stirs within *Kan*’s peril—how could it not be primordial, pervasive, beneficial, and steadfast? Thus, there is no need for further action; people naturally come to submit, and it is beneficial to establish lords. Observe the movement of thunder and rain filling all—heaven creates in the unformed, precisely the time to establish lords without rest. That *Zhen*’s one yang comes to dwell below this lower trigram is the power to place the noble below the lowly and greatly gain the people’s hearts. Such a person is precisely one for whom it is beneficial to establish lords and not rest. When heaven has this time, people must have this affair—thus the first nine acts in accord with the moment. Though one hears its sound, its form is unseen; dwelling in steadfastness as usual, guarding correctness as before, hesitating yet unwavering, not shifting a step—people naturally come to submit. Thus it is said: Though hesitating, its aspiration is rightly conducted. Its right conduct suffices to shake the age; it cannot abandon the first and go elsewhere. What further need is there for action? Thus the *Image* simply says: Do not act; there is somewhere to go. And the line reiterates: Hesitating, yet beneficial to dwell in steadfastness. The second six, soft and correct, mounts the first’s firm correctness—hence entangled, beset, riding horses in disarray, so difficult that it cannot easily be betrothed to the younger brother. Yet the first is the age’s destination; I, too, am adjacent to the first, sought day and night for marriage. Though not bandits, after ten years she conceives—reversing the norm. Matching sages with sages, exalting worthies with worthies—this too must have its Dao. The third six, in an age of deer-chasing, hopes day and night to obtain it. Yet above, there is no correspondence—no guide. Without a guide, why enter the forest? Thus desisting is the wise course. The fourth six is clear. In the time of *Tun*, how could there be another like the first to seek? Riding horses in disarray, carefully seeking this proper match in marriage—going is auspicious; what is not favorable? Thus it is said: Seeking and going—clarity. The first nine is the true lord; thus even if there is steadfast auspiciousness like the ninth five, its richness is stored with difficulty, and its bestowal is not yet radiant.",

The first line stands at the head, and the one below it is singular; the hexagram’s lines embody this principle, and thus it rightfully gains the people’s allegiance.\n\nYu Lingsheng said: The people are restless—without the noble one, there is no peace. After the realm has endured the peril of *Tun*-difficulties, the later king should govern with the policy of thunder and rain. Jin Rubai said: Eagerness to establish lords is itself a lack of peace—not that establishing lords brings further unrest. Luo Yizheng said: The unshakable boulder, the sturdy plank—both are things difficult to move, hence they serve as metaphors for the appearance of difficult progress. Hu Zhonghu said: The hexagram’s judgment sometimes refers specifically to the hexagram’s ruling line; here, the ruling line is *Zhen* (Thunder), and *Zhen* governs the first line. \"Hesitating\" corresponds to \"do not yet have somewhere to go,\" \"favorable to abide in steadfastness\" corresponds to \"favorable to be steadfast\"—the hexagram speaks of the advantage of establishing lords in terms of affairs, while the lines speak of the advantage of establishing lords in terms of persons. Cai Jiefu said: A girl, once betrothed, is given a courtesy name upon ascending; a man is given a courtesy name upon his capping.",
      "overlap_context": "ide, why enter the forest? Thus desisting is the wise course. The fourth six is clear. In the time of *Tun*, how could there be another like the first to seek? Riding horses in disarray, carefully seeking this proper match in marriage—going is auspicious; what is not favorable? Thus it is said: Seeking and going—clarity. The first nine is the true lord; thus even if there is steadfast auspiciousness like the ninth five, its richness is stored with difficulty, and its bestowal is not yet radiant.",

      "translated_text": "Yang Tingxiu said: The third line, possessing a firm and luminous talent yet dwelling in *Zhen* (Thunder), reaches the extreme of movement—recklessly aspiring to achieve the merit of resolving *Zhun* (Difficulty). This is what is meant by \"pursuing the deer.\" Acting recklessly and responding to the primal above is what is meant by \"primal miscalculation.\" Master Su [Dongpo] said: In *Zhun*, the primal and the upright are the masters, yet only those who humble themselves win the people. The third line, though endowed with primal virtue, harbors a desire to seek the people—this is like miscalculating and pursuing the deer. The deer cannot be tamed by virtue, and one only labors in vain by entering the forest. He further said: The third line has no proper correspondence, and the fifth is unworthy of allegiance. Not recognizing the fifth’s unworthiness, deluded by proximity, why not sooner attach oneself to the first nine? Thus, in exhaustion, one comes to weeping blood. Yu Zhongxiang said: The rains of *Kan* (Water) are called \"nourishing.\" As the *Book of Songs* says: \"The yin rains nourish it\"—this is its meaning. Wang Ji said: Heaven and Earth generate the myriad things. *Zhun* is the beginning of things’ generation, hence it follows *Qian* (Heaven) and *Kun* (Earth). When qi first intermingles yet remains unharmonious, it is called *Zhun*; when things first sprout yet remain curled, it is called *Zhun*; when the world is beset by many difficulties and not yet at peace, it is called *Zhun*. The noble one, observing the image of *Zhun*, weaves the affairs of the world to resolve its difficulties. This is the learning of the noble one in the primordial era, at the dawn of Heaven and Earth’s unfolding, who brings things to fruition and establishes order. Clouds above thunder: yin and yang first intermingle yet have not formed rain, hence it is *Zhun*. Clouds below thunder have already formed rain, hence it is *Jie* (Release). \"Weaving\" refers to the work of ordering silk. \"Warp\" (jing) is gathering the threads and separating them, like thunder’s self-gathering and dispersal. \"Woof\" (lun) is ordering the threads and uniting them, like clouds’ self-dispersal and coalescence. This is what is meant by \"weaving the great warp of the world.\"\n\nYang Jingzhong’s general principle of correspondence among the six lines:\nThe first and fourth correspond, the second and fifth correspond, the third and the top correspond. Why is this so? Because the hexagrams are doubled. Originally, there were only eight trigrams, each with three lines. When doubled, the fourth line of the upper trigram becomes the first of the lower trigram, the fifth line of the upper trigram becomes the second of the lower trigram, and the top line of the upper trigram becomes the top of the lower trigram. Only those of the same kind form the image of correspondence. Yet one yin and one yang correspond, while two yins do not correspond, nor do two yangs. Here, the third six and the top six are both yin, hence they lack the image of correspondence—and thus bear the image of \"pursuing the deer without miscalculation.\"\n\n*Kan* below, *Gen* above: *Meng* (Youthful Ignorance): Smooth progress. It is not I who seek the youthful ignorant—it is the youthful ignorant who seek me. The first divination is answered; repeated inquiries are an imposition, and impositions go unanswered. Favorable to be steadfast.\n\n*The Judgment* says: *Meng*—beneath the mountain lies peril, peril that halts: this is *Meng*. *Meng* leads to smooth progress, for one acts with timely moderation. It is not I who seek the youthful ignorant—it is the youthful ignorant who seek me: this is the resonance of aspirations. The first divination is answered, for there is firmness in the center. Repeated impositions are an imposition, and impositions go unanswered: this is the defilement of ignorance. Nurturing correctness in ignorance is the work of the sage.\n\n*The Image* says: Beneath the mountain, a spring emerges: this is *Meng*. The noble one, with resolute conduct, cultivates virtue.\n\nFirst six: Awakening ignorance. Favorable to employ punishments, to remove fetters and stocks. Proceeding brings regret.\n*The Image* says: Favorable to employ punishments, for this rectifies the law.\n\nNine two: Embracing ignorance brings good fortune. Taking a wife brings good fortune. The son is capable of managing the household.\n*The Image* says: The son is capable of managing the household, for firmness and softness meet.\n\nSix three: Do not take this woman; she sees a man of metal and loses herself, with no advantage anywhere.\n*The Image* says: Do not take this woman, for her conduct is not compliant.\n\nSix four: Beset by ignorance, regret.\n*The Image* says: The regret of being beset by ignorance arises from isolation and distance from substance.\n\nSix five: Youthful ignorance, good fortune.\n*The Image* says: The good fortune of youthful ignorance lies in compliance and deference.\n\nTop nine: Striking ignorance.

      "translated_text": "When it first halts, all is murky and undifferentiated, with no knowing where it goes. Thus is youthful ignorance; thus too is the sage. Though one might wish not to halt, how could it be otherwise? Hence it is said: Beneath the mountain lies peril, peril that halts—*Meng*. Yet if peril brings halting, then passage must come with smooth flow. And when it flows, the steadfast person is thus, and youthful ignorance is thus. Though one might wish not to proceed, how could it be otherwise? Hence it is said: *Meng*—smooth passage. To proceed with smoothness is to act in timely accord. To halt when the time is to halt, to proceed when the time is to proceed—this is precisely what it means to act in timely accord. The sage and the ignorant are not fundamentally different. Yet ignorance is the true nature of humanity; to nurture ignorance is thus to nurture correctness and to engage in the substantive work of sage-making. Hence it is said: *Meng* nurtures correctness—this is the work of the sage, and thus it is favorable and upright.\n\nIt is not I who seek the youthfully ignorant, but the youthfully ignorant who seek me—this speaks of my resonance with the fifth line’s intent, so the fifth naturally seeks me, not that I seek to instruct. Youthful ignorance is fundamentally without excess; I merely comply and encompass it, and that is sufficient. What does it seek, and what do I have to tell it?\n\nThe first divination is answered because the first six, just stepping out the door, casts the stalks and obtains the second line, drawing near to it to seek instruction. Hence it is said: \"by means of firmness and centrality.\" Yet if it comes a second time, or a third, one ultimately does not answer—this is not refusal to answer, but fear of spoiling the ignorant. Hence it is said: To spoil is not to answer, for it would drown the ignorant. Thus the first line’s \"favorable to punish,\" the third’s \"do not take this woman,\" and the fourth’s \"beset by regret\" all reflect this intent not to answer.\n\nAlas! Examine the *Xiang* commentary closely, and one will know the work of nurturing ignorance. If one repeatedly spoils it, this is striking ignorance, not nurturing it—this is acting as a bandit, not halting bandits. Only the top nine, who should halt at *Gen*’s stillness yet do not know to halt, would do this. How could the nine of the second line, who encompasses ignorance, act thus? If one aids it in halting bandits, then all below comply; if one acts as a bandit, then one above is already noncompliant—how could one make above and below all comply and achieve the utmost in great compliance?\n\nAlas! Without compliance in ignorance, how can one become a sage? Without compliant nurturing, how can one nurture correctness? Thus the sage uses this to comply with all under heaven, and through earnest reverence, all under heaven is pacified—without need for reward, the people are encouraged.\n\nNow observe its striking: the first line’s words say, \"Do not divine to seek my instruction,\" for I wish to dispel your ignorance—this is self-imposed constraint, urgently requiring correction. The method uses words to remove the constraint; only then can the constraint be undone. Otherwise, I fear that proceeding will bring regret, and one will cling to it all the more, making it impossible to remove. Have you not seen the fourth six? Originally an honest person, yet it deems itself unworthy and distances itself; originally ignorant, yet it deems itself unworthy and calls it heavenly constraint. If it already takes ignorance as constraint, how can its regret be undone?\n\nThe fifth six, yielding and compliant, dwelling centrally, is but a youthfully ignorant one. If taken as a wife, she is the wife of youthful ignorance; if taken as a son, he is the son who manages the household in youthful ignorance, where firmness and softness meet. There is nowhere it does not bring good fortune—only when the second nine’s encompassing of ignorance brings good fortune does the fifth six’s youthful ignorance achieve good fortune, and afterward the fifth six, with its own youthful ignorance, compliantly and deferentially enters the second nine’s encompassing of ignorance. Thus the second’s fundamental \"not advantageous\" is fitting, like the third six—she is not a woman one can take, but an untakable woman. This woman’s knowledge is greatly opened, and her conduct is no longer compliant with ignorance. What advantage is there for youthful ignorance?\n\nGenerally, the ignorant of the world, with their growing intelligence and broadening vision, often see gold yet fail to see themselves. Thus those who hear one and know ten are deemed greatly worthy, while those who engage in trade for a day are deemed empty fools, and those who are repeatedly empty are deemed mere beggars. They take themselves to be beset by hardship and unable to emerge. If one spoils them once, they rejoice; if one strikes them, they rejoice; if one imposes constraints, they rejoice again—where can the work of nurturing correctness be applied?\n\nWang Benhe says: After *Qian* and *Kun* come *Zhun* and *Meng*. *Zhun* is the initial unfolding of the times, when the world is ignorant, and the sage’s way of revolving *Qian* and turning *Kun* begins here. In *Meng*, knowledge has not yet spread, and the human heart is beset by difficulty—the sage’s work of opening heaven and cleaving earth begins here. *Zhun* is the world’s ignorance; *Meng* is humanity’s *Zhun*. Thus *Zhun* establishes lords, while *Meng* is favorable for resisting bandits.\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Fusi says: Nothing is clearer than the sage; nothing is more obscure than ignorance.

      "translated_text": "Program Zhengshu says: *Gen* is the mountain, signifying stillness. *Kan* is water, signifying peril. With peril beneath the mountain, one halts after surmounting danger, yet knows not where to go—this is the image of *Meng*.\n\nYou Dingfu says: A spring issues from beneath the mountain, its flow yet undispersed, its force not yet fully manifest. Observing its force’s unmanifested reach, one acts with resolve; observing its undispersed unity, one nurtures virtue.\n\nWang Ji says: A spring issuing from beneath the mountain is by nature still and clear—the source of water’s purity. Unconfined by east or west, unmuddied by silt and sand, guided by its singular flow, it naturally reaches the sea. The noble person models himself on *Meng*. The image shows resolute action nurturing one’s virtue. Water flows without ceasing, hence “resolute”; the mountain stands firm without yielding, hence “nurturing.” That undivided, unaroused unity is the essence of *Meng*. *Meng* is the foundation of sageliness. Yet from the meaning of *Meng*, worldly scholars fail to understand, mistaking it for obscurity. They recklessly strive to carve and dredge, fostering cunning and wit, muddying it with the desires of silt and sand, diverting it with the currents of east and west, thereby dissipating the integrity of undivided purity and obstructing the source of clarity and stillness. This not only brings no benefit but inflicts harm. The essence of sagely work lies entirely in *Meng*. In terms of heaven’s seasons, darkness is the mechanism of dawning clarity. In human affairs, obscurity is the prelude to illumination. Yet the world fails to perceive this. Mencius said: “The great person does not lose the heart of the infant.” The heart of the infant is precisely what is meant by *Meng*.\n\n*Kan* below, *Qian* above: *Xu*. With sincerity, radiant success; uprightness brings good fortune. Favorable for fording the great river.\n\n**The Image** says: *Xu* means “to await”; peril lies ahead. Firm and strong, one does not sink—thus one’s principle is not beset by exhaustion. *Xu*: with sincerity, radiant success, uprightness brings good fortune. Occupying heaven’s position, centered and correct. Favorable for fording the great river—advancing will bring achievement.\n\n**The Image** says: Clouds ascend above heaven—*Xu*. The noble person takes this as a model for feasting and rejoicing.\n\n**First Nine**: Awaiting at the outskirts. Favorable to persist; no blame.\n**The Image** says: Awaiting at the outskirts—one does not rashly advance into difficulty. Favorable to persist; no blame—one has not lost constancy.\n\n**Nine in the Second**: Awaiting on the sands. Minor words arise, but in the end, good fortune.\n**The Image** says: Awaiting on the sands—one’s breadth lies in the center. Though minor words arise, the end is good.\n\n**Nine in the Third**: Awaiting in the mire—this brings raiders to arrive.\n**The Image** says: Awaiting in the mire—disaster lies without. One brings raiders upon oneself; reverent caution averts defeat.\n\n**Six in the Fourth**: Awaiting in blood—emerging from the cave.\n**The Image** says: Awaiting in blood—submissive and heeding.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth**: Awaiting with wine and food—uprightness brings good fortune.\n**The Image** says: Wine and food, uprightness brings good fortune—through central correctness.\n\n**Top Six**: Entering the cave—three uninvited guests arrive.

      "translated_text": "The talent of unyielding strength finds no difficulty in overcoming peril, yet struggles not to court it. At first, having stepped beyond the gate and awaited at the outskirts, one must not rush forward—I know they will not breach the gate of peril. Yet I fear they may lack endurance, lose their steadfast heart, and though they court peril, disregard it entirely. Thus, it is said: \"Through constancy in action, no blame.\" **Nine in the Second** awaits near danger, resembling one who waits upon the sands. Though sand is not water, it is where water must inevitably flow; thus, to await upon the sands is akin to moving through the midst of water. With the Second’s resolute and luminous talent, centered in its position, though it hears minor grumblings on all sides, it attains ultimate good fortune and preserves it to the end.\n\n**Nine in the Third**, encountering rigidity, finds no rest upon the sands and instead awaits only to sink into the mire. The mire ensnares one far more deeply than sand—how could this not be considered? Yet the Third knows only that water cannot bring disaster, unaware that peril lies without. Once mired, it cannot advance in joy nor retreat at will—raiders arrive. Who, if not oneself, has summoned them? This stems from insufficient foresight, careless awaiting, and the fault of excessive rigidity. Yet by virtue of its strength, if it humbly redoubles its reverent caution, it will surely not fail. Though not failing is good, how much better to have never reached the mire at all. Thus, when danger lies ahead and one cannot await, even the unyielding strength of Qian cannot escape entrapment or exhaustion. How much more so for the yielding **Six in the Fourth** and the **Top Six**?\n\nNow, **Six in the Fourth** dwells beneath the abyss, its image one of awaiting while wounded—seemingly unable to emerge. Yet it escapes the pit’s depths by submitting and heeding. **Nine in the Fifth** would rather endure injury than rush forward—this is the power of central correctness. **Top Six**, positioned above the abyss, nearly exits its confines, yet instead of awaiting, it retreats into the pit’s depths—is this not extreme? Thus, it is told: though you have entered the cave, you are fortunate that three uninvited guests arrive. For **Nine in the Third**, corresponding to the Top, is the Top’s guest. Now, the Third, through reverent caution, has escaped peril and comes forth. If you treat them with reverence, you may yet secure ultimate good fortune. Though you have entered the cave, what harm is there? Yet while the Top is fortunate in the Third’s arrival, it is also heeding the **Nine in the Fifth**’s warning.\n\nFrom this, I observe: the yielding fear they cannot emerge, while the firm fear they cannot await. In this hexagram of *Xu*, the Sage speaks especially to those of firm strength. \"Through constancy in action\" serves as a warning to all. \"Minor grumblings\" serve as a warning to the Second. \"Summoning raiders\" serves as a warning to the Third. Who is warned to await with sincerity, radiance, prosperity, uprightness, and good fortune? It is **Nine in the Fifth**, enthroned in the celestial position, who may ford great rivers and advance to achieve merit. For the Fifth, though dwelling in inquiry, forgets its peril and awaits only with wine and food—much like one in *Kun*. **Nine in the Second**, though situated in distress, forgets its distress and knows only to be content with wine and food. This is the supreme virtue and essential path of awaiting in *Xu* and enduring in *Kun*. Thus, it is said: \"Uprightness brings good fortune,\" and again: \"Through central correctness, it is supremely so.\"\n\nAlas! To remain still and await, not even venturing beyond the outskirts with food and drink—how much less should one reach the mire? Liu Yongxiang says: The three guests are **Nine in the Third**. Though the Third does not occupy the Fifth’s position, it is firm and strong; treating it with reverence incurs no great loss. In this hexagram, only **Six in the Fourth** can submit and heed, while the others—**Nine in the Fifth** and the rest—bear the image of Qian’s unyielding vigor and overbearing force, unable to await or heed. Were it not for the Fifth’s celestial position, its central correctness, and its repeated, earnest admonitions, they would not await. This is why the Fifth is radiant and prosperous.\n\n**Appendix**\nJin Rubai says: The Fourth and Top, both yin lines within *Kan*, thus both speak of the cave—just as in the *Kan* hexagram, the initial and third lines both form *Kan*.\nWang Ji says: Qian’s unyielding strength, when advancing and encountering peril, does not rush forward—thus *Xu* holds the path to prosperity. If one awaits with a yielding and weak nature, delaying without progress, then awaiting becomes a burden of affairs.\nThe *Shuowen* states: *Xu* (await) derives from *ye* (page, head) and *shan* (ornament, hair); originally referring to the beard, it is borrowed for the sense of \"that which is needed.\"\nFang Shihua says: The Master used this to explain *Xu*, meaning to await **Nine in the Fifth**.\n\n---\n**Water over Heaven: Song**\n*Song*: Sincerity obstructed, caution—central good fortune, ultimate misfortune. Favorable to see the great person; unfavorable to ford great rivers.\n**The Judgment** says: *Song* arises from rigidity above and peril below—peril and strength contend. *Song* with sincerity obstructed, caution, and central good fortune: strength comes and attains the center. Ultimate misfortune: contention cannot be completed. Favorable to see the great person: esteeming central correctness. Unfavorable to ford great rivers: entering the abyss.\n**The Image** says: Heaven and water move in opposition—*Song*. The noble person, in undertaking affairs, plans from the beginning.\n\n**Initial Six**: Does not prolong the affair; minor grumblings, ultimate good fortune.\n**The Image** says: Does not prolong the affair—contention cannot be long. Though minor grumblings arise, its clarity prevails.\n\n**Nine in the Second**: Does not prevail in contention; retreats and flees—his village of three hundred households remains unharmed.\n**The Image** says: Does not prevail in contention—retreating and fleeing. Contending from below against above brings calamity upon oneself.\n\n**Six in the Third**: Feeds on old virtue; uprightness is perilous, ultimate good fortune. If following royal affairs, no achievement.\n**The Image** says: Feeds on old virtue—following above brings good fortune.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth**: Does not prevail in contention; returns to the mandate, changes, and finds peace in uprightness—good fortune.",

      "translated_text": "**The Image** says: Returns to the mandate, changes, and finds peace in uprightness—nothing is lost.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth**: Contention brings supreme good fortune.\n**The Image** says: Contention brings supreme good fortune—through central correctness.\n\n**Top Nine**: Perhaps granted a leather belt, yet by day’s end it is thrice stripped away.\n**The Image** says: Receiving robes through contention is hardly worthy of respect.\n\n**Heaven and Water in Contention**\nFang Shihua says: This hexagram combines superior firmness with inferior peril, peril yet strength. Without peril, contention cannot arise; without strength, contention cannot be sustained. Only peril paired with strength brings contention to fruition. Yet can contention truly be achieved? Can it truly endure? Can it persist long enough to follow royal affairs, prolonging the affair indefinitely? Fortunately, the central and correct Nine in the Fifth, a noble person, seeks to eliminate contention entirely, offering those who contend what they truly desire to see. And Nine in the Second, firm yet yielding to the center, ensures that contention fails of itself—it cannot endure, cannot persist, cannot drag on, and ultimately sinks into the abyss. For yang is solid while yin is hollow; firmness yielding to the center embodies trust and clarity. Yet a single yang trapped within yin, peril, obstruction, and trepidation is all too evident. Obstruction gives rise to contention; trepidation ensures it does not endure—how much more so when Nine in the Fifth appears? Thus, at the first sight of Nine in the Fifth, shame and remorse leave no room for delay: contention fails, retreat and flight follow, as is fitting.\n\nIs not the Second the master of peril? All within its inner trigram are those it ordinarily commands. Once it contends with the Fifth, great contention erupts, and the implicated multiply. Yet if it retreats and flees, the three hundred households of its village will surely escape disaster—such is the Second’s refusal to prolong contention. As for the Initial and Fourth, neither wishes to prolong contention. The Third, too, does not seek contention, though it fears provocation may lead to following royal affairs. Thus, when circumstances align, a leather belt may be granted, and the Top, too, fails in contention. All five lines thus benefit from the presence of Nine in the Fifth, and contention ultimately ceases. How supreme is the Fifth’s supreme good fortune through central correctness! Hence it is said: “In hearing contention, I am no different from others—what I must do is eliminate contention altogether.” This describes Nine in the Fifth. Thus, the Fifth line speaks only of “contention bringing supreme good fortune,” not of “hearing contention,” for supreme good fortune is its essence. Even if one hears contention well, how can it bring supreme good fortune?\n\nFrom today’s perspective: the Initial, yielding and dwelling below, rests in softness, does not prolong the affair, and though minor grumblings arise, clarity prevails and contention ceases. Its good fortune in not prolonging contention is fitting. The Fourth and Fifth share the same body, benefiting from the presence of Nine in the Fifth, returning to the mandate, changing, and finding peace in uprightness—uniquely preserving the Fifth’s earnest desire to avoid contention. Its good fortune in not prolonging contention is especially fitting. Though the Top is excessively firm and dwells above, the Third feeds on old virtue, perilous at first but ultimately fortunate. Alas! The granting of the leather belt, the thrice-stripped shame—one may say the Top, too, does not prolong contention. Why? Because it still retains a sense of shame.",

      "translated_text": "Fearing it might reveal its original countenance before the Nine in the Fifth.\n\n**Appendix**\nYang Zhongli says: The heavens rotate leftward while water flows eastward—this is contrary movement. When affairs reach the point of contrary movement before one deliberates, excess has already taken hold.\n\nWang Ji says: Heaven is the beginning of the Three Powers; water is the beginning of the Five Phases. The noble person models himself upon them in acting and planning at the outset. In all matters, there is a beginning, a middle, and an end—contention in the middle brings good fortune, but contention at the end brings misfortune. If one can plan at the outset to sever contention, then the proper course in the middle and end need not be spoken of.\n\nHe also says: Observing the image of heaven and water moving in contrary directions—heaven’s leftward rotation and the five planets’ rightward revolution—this is further confirmed.\n\n**Hexagram 7: 师 (Shi / The Army)**\n**Judgment:** *Uprightness. The elder brings good fortune; there is no blame.*\n**The Tuan (#35) says:** The army is the multitude. Uprightness is correctness. To be able to correct the multitude is to be fit to rule. Firmness in the center with resonance, advancing through peril yet in accord—using this to administer the world, the people follow. What blame could there be in good fortune?\n**The Xiang says:** Water within the earth—this is *The Army*. The noble person thereby contains the people and nurtures the multitude.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Six:** The army marches by discipline; if not good, there is misfortune.\n**The Xiang says:** The army marches by discipline—losing discipline brings misfortune.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** In the army, centeredness brings good fortune and no blame; the king thrice bestows command.\n**The Xiang says:** In the army, centeredness brings good fortune—it receives the favor of heaven. The king thrice bestows command, cherishing the myriad states.\n\n**Six in the Third:** The army may bear corpses in its chariots—misfortune.\n**The Xiang says:** The army may bear corpses in its chariots—great excess in achievement.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** The army retreats to the left—no blame.\n**The Xiang says:** Retreating to the left incurs no blame—it does not lose constancy.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** There are creatures in the fields; it is beneficial to seize them. No blame. The eldest son leads the army; the younger son bears corpses—uprightness brings misfortune.\n**The Xiang says:** The eldest son leads the army—he acts with centeredness. The younger son bears corpses—his appointment is improper.\n\n**Top Six:** The great lord issues a command, enfeoffing and establishing a house. The petty man must not be employed.\n**The Xiang says:** The great lord issues a command—to rightly reward merit. The petty man must not be employed, for he will surely disorder the state.\n\n**Hexagram 8: 比 (Bi / Alliance)**\nWater clings to earth—this is *Alliance*. Seeking security through attachment is impossible without the firm centeredness of the Nine in the Fifth.\n\nWater within the earth is *The Army*. The army is the multitude, yet to correct the multitude is impossible without the firm centeredness of the Nine in the Second. Thus, the hexagram takes the Nine in the Second as the elder. Only by obtaining the elder and entrusting him exclusively can one achieve good fortune without blame. How true this is! The difficulty of employing the multitude lies in correcting it. To correct the multitude is to be fit to rule the world. Thus it says: *Uprightness is correctness.* What is uprightness? \"There are creatures in the fields; it is beneficial to seize them.\" To employ them with justification—this is what is meant by uprightness. Using the multitude in this way is to employ them to rightly govern the state, to enfeoff and establish a house, to pacify and cherish the people—what else could this be if not uprightness? Thus, using this to administer the people, the people follow, for it is upright.\n\nYet if one does not know the way of exclusive entrustment, even with the elder of the Nine in the Second, achieving merit will be difficult. This is what is meant by sending the eldest son to lead the army while also dispatching the younger son to bear corpses. In such a case, even uprightness brings misfortune, and ultimate defeat and disorder are inevitable. How could one hope for good fortune and no blame? What use is uprightness then? Truly, the difficulty of the army lies in correcting the multitude. The difficulty of correcting the multitude lies in obtaining the elder. Yet obtaining the elder is difficult, and being able to employ the elder is even more difficult.\n\nNow, the Nine in the Second, dwelling below and centered, is precisely the elder’s selection, and the Six in the Fifth responds to him—it is not that the latter cannot employ him. The concern is that there may be divided loyalties, and his employment may not be exclusive. Thus, the Initial Six, upon stepping out the door, is immediately warned against losing discipline: the army’s discipline and commands issue solely from the eldest son; no other may usurp authority. If the Initial Six dares to usurp, it is a loss of discipline. Losing discipline—even if good, there is misfortune; how much worse if not good? Goodness is uprightness.\n\nNow, the Six in the Fifth, able to regard the Second as the eldest son and thrice bestow command upon him, and the Second, in turn, achieves good fortune in the center of the army and receives the favor of heaven’s bestowal—yet the Initial Six cannot escape the warning of discipline, the Six in the Third cannot avoid the suspicion of bearing corpses, and the Six in the Fifth cannot prevent the dispatch of the younger son and the employment of petty men. The body of Kun is yielding and compliant, and this is to be feared.\n\nOnly the Six in the Fourth, attaining correctness, serves as a deputy general stationed to the left, able to retreat and await command. Thus it says: \"The army may bear corpses in its chariots—great excess in achievement.\" The great refers to unity. If corpses are borne in chariots, greatness achieves no merit. How could the Six in the Fifth still dispatch the younger son to inquire? Thus, in the top line, it is reiterated: The great lord commands the general to lead the army, originally for the purpose of enfeoffment and establishing a house, employing them to pacify and cherish the myriad states—petty men must not be involved. Involving petty men will surely disorder the state.\n\nFor the Nine in the Second is yang firmness, the eldest son, the elder; the Initial and Third are yin softness. The soft are younger sons; younger sons should only be made to heed the commands of the eldest son. The yin are petty men; petty men should only be made to heed the commands of the elder. How could one employ the words of petty men or let the younger sons take charge of affairs? Alas! For a thousand years after, worthy generals who could not exercise exclusive authority met with disaster and defeat—this was invariably the cause.\n\nIn the Tang dynasty, when Yu Chao’en was made *Observer of the Army*, even Li Guangbi, the hero of Linhuai for the ages, and Guo Ziyi, the greatest figure of his time, could not avoid losing armies and discipline. Emperor Daizong, though he had shared hardships with them and together they had recovered the two capitals, ultimately trusted and employed petty men, forcing the emperor to flee once more to Shaan—this was no other reason than that he was yielding and easily swayed, truly like the Six in the Fifth of this hexagram.",

Thus, “water lies within the earth.” When armies are spoken of, they should flow like water beneath the earth, unseen by men.\n\nLiu Yongxiang said: “The second and fifth lines correspond, so the conferral of mandate is evident. Only after the fourth line aligns with the third can the second and third lines’ conferral be discerned.” The *Disciples* are none other than *petty men*—there are not two kinds.\n\nXiong Guo said: “The *Army* hexagram has one yang line leading five yin lines, for in ancient times five men formed a squad, five squads a platoon, five platoons a company, and five companies a battalion—all reckoned from the number five.” *A cartload of corpses*: Master Cheng interprets this as “the masses acting as the master.” According to ancient usage, *yú lùn* (public opinion) and *yú rén zhī sòng* (the people’s songs) both refer to the multitude. The *Odes* say: “Who is the master of this?”—*shī* (master) here means *to preside over*.\n\nYang Jingzhong said: “Water flowing beneath the earth, if there is something to contain it, accumulates and embodies the image of a gathered army.

The Initial Six, occupying the first position as yin, truly responds to the primordial and correct, and its disquiet must yield to sincerity. Only then does it attain its proper union and incur no blame. Moreover, situated at the base of the earthly *Kūn*, water must fill it, presenting the image of sincerity filling the vessel.

      "translated_text": "Thus, if disquiet can be rectified and alignment drawn near, then in the end, even severed ties may yet yield other auspices. Hence it is said: \"Disquiet rectified draws near\"—above and below respond to one another. The \"above\" refers to the Fourth; the \"below\" refers to the Initial. For the Nine in the Fifth, firm and central in its correctness, is the true king, now manifestly befriended and aligned by all. Should any remain unaligned, the method of the threefold drive is employed to draw them in, yet the forward quarry may be lost—this is not a matter of insistence. Such is merely the king’s intent; how could the people of the domain know it? Without command or admonition, they are left to their own alignment, nor are they driven forward—yet the center above truly enables this. The king’s impartiality, in this way, becomes manifest and universally trusted. Thus the lower positions contend to align, and good fortune is assured.\n\nYet is not the Six in the Upper precisely the loss of the forward quarry? If the Three, instead of aligning with the Five, aligns with the Six, is this not the harm of associating with the unworthy? Therefore, the Initial Six and the Six in the Second do not join the Three in the selection of the threefold drive. The people of the domain, without command or admonition, choose compliance and reject opposition, aligning with the primal and maintaining steadfast correctness—this is how it must be. The Six in the Upper, at the apex of alignment, still clings to the primal chief as its match—how dire the misfortune! Truly, I know not how it will end. For when it stands before the Five, it is said, \"the forward quarry is lost\"; when it clings to the primal chief as its match, unaware of aligning with the Five, it is said, \"the latter will meet with misfortune.\"\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Fusi says: The upper and lower yang positions divide the people, yet the Five alone abides in honor, and all turn toward it. Above and below respond to it, exalted and at peace. Peace draws the disquieted to shelter, hence \"disquiet rectified draws near\"—above and below respond. The primal seeks those who possess; it does not seek those who endanger, but those who bring peace. It does not seek those who withdraw, for fire has its flame, and the cold draw near—thus, if one is at peace, the disquieted will draw near. Peace, honor, harmony, and kinship, yet lingering behind—this is why punishment brings misfortune.\n\nMaster Su of the Eastern Slope says: Alignment brings good fortune. No alignment is without good fortune, yet aligning with the wrong person, though presently fortunate, will later incur blame. Hence it is said, \"divine again\"—divine whom to follow. \"Divine again\" means to divine twice, the height of caution.\n\nZhao Ruqi says: Alignment does not consider correspondence but focuses solely on aligning with the Five.\n\nBan Mengjian says: \"Quarry\" is the general term for birds and beasts, those captured and controlled by humans.\n\nBu Zixia says: Primal sincerity in attachment, when the Dao is exhausted and alignment follows, execution will ensue.

For the noble one, advancing brings misfortune—there is cause for doubt.\n\n**Fāng Shíhuà’s Commentary on *Wind Above Heaven: Small Taming*:**\nThe hexagram is named *Small Taming* because the single yin line at the fourth position, as the yielding ruler of Xùn, has attained its proper place. Moreover, it resides above Qián, vigorous yet yielding. Thus, the ninth line above (Nine Five) responds to the first line below (Initial Nine), while Nine Two also responds above. All below respond to the fourth line, each willing to be tamed by it—hence *Small Taming*. Though the single yin of Six Four is small, it can tame the greatness of many yang lines. This must arise from more than mere vigor—it must act with vigor while practicing yielding. Here, the firm and centered Five alone can extend sincere trust, achieving the twin-like sincerity that allows Six Four’s will to be enacted, and the Dao of taming to prosper. Furthermore, Initial Nine corresponds with Four—returning to Four is returning by one’s own path. Nine Two is adjacent to Initial Nine; Initial Nine responds to Four, and Nine Two is drawn to Initial Nine—this is *drawn back to return*. Yet without Nine Five first responding to it, how could Four fulfill its will, and how would the many yang lines willingly submit to its taming? The two lines about *dense clouds* depict the scene of rising clouds and impending rain, expressing delight in its taming. The tradition says *the bestowal has not yet taken effect*—this precisely describes the process of taming. But *not yet taken effect* does not mean it will never take effect.",

      "translated_text": "Six Four, being firm yet yielding, can thus employ a person of sincere substance to manifest the vigilance of Qian, casting aside its blood and directly entering through yielding. Thereby, Nine Five obtains the aid of its neighbor to enjoy its secure wealth and honored position—this is the depth of its trustworthiness. When Nine Three ascends to pair with Six Four, it forms the image of husband and wife, yet is excessively rigid and not centered. If Four regards it as a cheek to its jawbone, Three instead sheds its spokes, turns away in hostility, and pays no heed—how then can it govern the household and establish the family? This is the fault of Nine Three, not a flaw in Four.\n\nUpper Nine’s view of Nine Three differs. It does not recognize that Four’s Way of taming has already succeeded: formerly dense clouds, now rain has fallen. Formerly one longed for rain, now rain has come and the situation has shifted. Crops now stand in the fields, gathered into granaries, and virtue is fully borne. Four is yin, Five is yang. If Four is taken as the wife, she is steadfast and vigilant; Four is the fourth month, Five the fifth day. If Four is taken as the moon, it waxes toward fullness in mutual gaze—how is this not secure? If its taming does not share in governance but seeks separate validation, then Six Four’s capacity for taming need only join with others to fulfill its taming—no doubt is necessary.\n\nThat Upper Nine resists its taming stems merely from its suspicion, in Four’s yielding entry, that Four is not a true noble. Yet this Six Four of *Small Taming* is precisely firm yet yielding, capable of greatness, benefiting the state and greatly benefiting the ruler. Such was the great minister of old—what doubt could there be?\n\nWang’s edition records He’s note: “When yin doubts yang, it leads to bloody conflict, hence *Kun*’s Upper Six bears the wound of dark and yellow. When yin trusts yang, blood is dispelled, hence *Small Taming*’s Six Four is free from the burden of blood and qi.”\n\n**Appendix**\nYang Jian said: “Yi Yin’s treatment of Tai Jia was not initially smooth, but when Tai Jia suddenly awoke and sincerely reformed, Yi Yin’s will then came to fruition—thus it became smooth. If Heaven had not thundered greatly with wind to complete the transformation, and the king had not wept while holding the decree, the Duke of Zhou’s will could never have been called fulfilled, nor could *Small Taming*’s smoothness have been achieved. Six Four, utmost in softness and embodying yielding, tames the ruler with gentle compliance, so ruler and minister trust and harmonize, free from harm, free from fear, without blame. This is the natural image of yin and yang’s mutual accord.\n\nWhen ministers offer counsel to rulers, discord often arises because the minister has not eliminated self-interest—whether craving reputation, prizing personal victory, or failing to align with the ruler’s will. Thus discord emerges. The *Book of Documents* states: ‘If you have excellent plans or strategies, present them. Thereafter, attend to inner matters, then outwardly comply.’ It says: ‘These plans, these strategies belong to our lord alone.’ A virtuous minister tames the ruler in this way—how could discord arise?”\n\nThe *Image* says: “Above, the wills align”—how profound is this teaching!\n\nJin Rubai said: “Both Four and Five speak of having trust—this is mutual trust between the two lines. Four says ‘above, the wills align,’ meaning it aligns with Five. Four relies on Five to tame, while Qian’s Five entrusts Four and they trust one another.”\n\n**Hexagram 10: Lü (Treading)**\n*Below Dui, above Qian*\nTreading on a tiger’s tail—it does not bite the person. Smoothness.\n\n**Judgment:**\n*Treading* means the yielding treads upon the firm. Joyful and responsive to Qian, thus treading on a tiger’s tail without being bitten—smoothness. Firm, centered, and correct, treading the imperial position without distress—radiant clarity.\n\n**Image:**\nHeaven above, marsh below—*Treading*. The noble person thereby distinguishes above and below, settling the people’s will.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Nine:** Plain treading—going forth without blame.\n*Image:* Going forth with plain treading—acting alone on one’s aspiration.\n\n**Nine Two:** Treading a level path—secluded persons: steadfastness brings good fortune.\n*Image:* The secluded person’s steadfast good fortune—centered, not self-disordered.\n\n**Six Three:** Dim-sighted yet striving to see, lame yet striving to tread—treading on a tiger’s tail, it bites the person. Misfortune. A martial man acts as a great lord.\n*Image:* Dim-sighted yet striving to see—insufficient for clarity. Lame yet striving to tread—insufficient for movement. The misfortune of being bitten—position improper. A martial man acting as a great lord—will is rigid.\n\n**Nine Four:** Treading on a tiger’s tail—cautious, ultimately good fortune.\n*Image:* Cautious, ultimately good fortune—will is enacted.\n\n**Nine Five:** Decisive treading—steadfastness is perilous.\n*Image:* Decisive treading—steadfastness is perilous—position is correct and proper.\n\n**Upper Nine:** Contemplating one’s treading, examining the omens—its return is supremely auspicious.\n*Image:* Supreme auspiciousness above—great celebration.\n\n**Hexagram 10: Lü (Treading)**\nFang Shihua said: “Nine Five, with Qian’s firm virtue, occupies the supreme position. Those who tread behind it are joyful and responsive to Qian—what peril could there be? Yet the line uniquely speaks of decisiveness and perilous steadfastness, indicating a specific reference. Thus the *Image* directly names the hexagram with the three words ‘treading a tiger’s tail.’ It is as if treading a tiger’s tail and merely avoiding being bitten is already fortunate, yet the Master’s commentary focuses on the yielding treading the firm, joy responding to Qian, and its firmness, centrality, and correctness—treading the imperial position without distress, so radiantly clear. This further reveals that with Qian above and Dui below, there is absolutely no cause for concern. The intent is to display its virtue through this hexagram, differing from King Wen’s *Appended Judgments*.\n\nSix Three is neither centered nor correct, its will rigid and vision dim—hence its image. King Wen’s meaning is that when ministers serve rulers, there is always the peril of treading on a tiger. Treading requires seeing with the eyes. Now Six Three is blind and cannot see—how could it not be bitten by Initial Nine? At the bottom of the hexagram, just stepping out the door already fears treading on a tiger, yet it can tread plainly and go forth, acting alone on its aspiration—its foresight is early indeed.”",
      "overlap_context": " is drawn to Initial Nine—this is *drawn back to return*. Yet without Nine Five first responding to it, how could Four fulfill its will, and how would the many yang lines willingly submit to its taming? The two lines about *dense clouds* depict the scene of rising clouds and impending rain, expressing delight in its taming. The tradition says *the bestowal has not yet taken effect*—this precisely describes the process of taming. But *not yet taken effect* does not mean it will never take effect.",

      "translated_text": "At the bottom, in the initial position, this is its plainness—hence it is called \"plain treading.\" Nine Two, however, sees the path of treading as vast indeed. Though a reclusive person may also be steadfast and auspicious, why must one seek resonance with the fifth to tread upon its tail, spending the whole day in anxious dread, disturbing one’s centeredness? This too is one who sees in advance, avoids perilous conduct—an ancient noble scholar.\n\nFour occupies the position of a great minister, near Nine Five, and cannot but tread upon the tiger’s tail. Yet by recognizing it as a tiger and remaining in anxious dread, it ultimately achieves good fortune and fulfills its will without being bitten. Still, it is perilous—neither the first nor the second would willingly accept such a position.\n\nNine at the top, having completed its affairs at the end of treading, reviews its path and examines its omens, then returns to the beginning—supremely auspicious. Naturally, those like Three, unable to see, are likened to the blind; those unable to tread, to the lame. Only through blindness does one fail to act, and thus attempt to wrestle tigers bare-handed or act as a warrior before the great lord—its misfortune is assured. Though called resolute in will, what is there to commend?\n\nMaster Li the Bald said: When King Wen faced the decline of Yin, he once personally suffered its bite. How fitting that his reflections were so deeply felt and lingering! Why else would he name this hexagram *Treading on a Tiger’s Tail* with Heaven above and Marsh below? And why, in the line statements, speak of being bitten as misfortune, yet in the *Image* declare that not being bitten brings prosperity? The prosperity of not being bitten arises from the inner softness of Dui. The misfortune of being bitten stems from Six Three’s rigid will, unlike Four’s fulfilled aspiration.\n\nAlas! In such times, one could not tread plainly like the first, nor retreat like the reclusive second, nor return like the final nine. In the aftermath of pain, even King Wen must have regretted his warrior’s lament. Thus, the blind gaze and lame tread were King Wen’s affairs before his imprisonment at Youli. The anxious dread that ended in good fortune were his affairs after Youli. The return to supreme auspiciousness came only after he was enfeoffed as Lord of the West and granted the power to wage war—all King Wen’s hexagram. It directly illuminates *Brightness Obscured*.\n\nWang Benhe said: Rather than anxiously seeking to avoid being bitten, how much better to tread the Way with ease and attain steadfast auspiciousness!\n\n**Appendix**\nCheng Zhengshu said: Heaven above and marsh below—this is the proper order of above and below, the principle of things. The noble person observes the image of *Treading* to distinguish between high and low and settle the people’s will. Only when the distinction between high and low is clear can the people’s will be settled. With the people’s will settled, governance can then be discussed.\n\nIn ancient times, from dukes and ministers downward, each position matched its virtue, and one remained in it for life, fulfilling one’s proper role. If a position did not match one’s virtue, the ruler would promote one; scholars cultivated their learning, and when their learning was complete, the ruler would seek them. Farmers, artisans, merchants, and traders diligently performed their tasks with limited rewards, so all had settled aspirations.\n\nIn later ages, from common scholars to high ministers, all daily aspired to honor and glory. Farmers, artisans, merchants, and traders daily pursued wealth and extravagance. The hearts of the multitudes raced after profit, and the world was in chaos—how could it be unified? To expect it not to descend into disorder would be difficult indeed.\n\nBelow, Qian; above, Kun.",

      "translated_text": "**Peace (泰):**\n\"Small departs, great arrives—auspicious, smooth.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\nPeace—small departs, great arrives, auspicious, smooth—means Heaven and Earth unite, and the myriad things communicate; above and below unite, and their aspirations align. Within, yang; without, yin. Within, strength; without, compliance. Within, the noble person; without, the petty person. The noble person’s Dao grows, the petty person’s Dao wanes.\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\nHeaven and Earth unite in Peace. The ruler thereby completes the Dao of Heaven and Earth, assisting and harmonizing with their principles, to guide the people.\n\n**First Nine:**\n\"Pulling cogon grass by its roots, advancing with its kind—auspicious in advancement.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\n\"Pulling cogon grass, advancing auspiciously\"—the aspiration lies in the external.\n\n**Nine Two:**\n\"Embracing the vast, fording the river; no distant exclusion, no clique loyalty—attaining esteem in the central conduct.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\n\"Embracing the vast, attaining esteem in the central conduct\"—thereby illuminating and magnifying.\n\n**Nine Three:**\n\"Level without incline, advancing without return—steadfast in hardship, no blame. Do not worry over its sincerity; in nourishment, there is fortune.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\n\"Advancing without return\"—the boundary of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Six Four:**\n\"Fluttering, not wealthy, with its neighbors—no warning, yet sincere.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\n\"Fluttering, not wealthy\"—all lose substance. \"No warning, yet sincere\"—the heart’s desire.\n\n**Six Five:**\n\"Di Yi marries off his younger sister—blessing, supremely auspicious.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\n\"Blessing, supremely auspicious\"—acting from the center to fulfill aspirations.\n\n**Top Six:**\n\"The city wall collapses into the moat—do not mobilize troops. From the capital, decrees are issued—steadfastness brings regret.\"\n\n**The *Xiang* says:**\n\"The city wall collapses into the moat\"—its mandate is in chaos.\n\n**Earth above, Heaven below—Peace.**\nPeace: small departs, great arrives. \"Auspicious, smooth\" speaks of the way to achieve Peace. Only when small and great exchange departures and arrivals can the small be auspicious, the great smooth, and Peace enduring. Thus, the First Nine, situated at the base of the three yang lines, embodies the inception of greatness yet aspires to the external. The yin of the outer seeks to unite with the small, pulling the three yang lines forward in kind—hence the four lines flutter in mutual trust, and small and great exchange.\n\nThe three yin lines, all lacking wealth and substance, should not sincerely respond to the yang. Yet now they flutteringly advance to unite with yang—how could this involve mobilization or warning? It is the heart’s desire, unwarned yet sincere. It is not for the wealth of their neighbors but to serve between the ruler and minister of the second and fifth lines. Thus, Nine Two, with the virtue of embracing the vast, esteems the host, while Six Five, with blessing and supreme auspiciousness, marries off the younger sister—not only fulfilling aspirations but also realizing them. Is this not the way to achieve Peace: a ruler who empties himself to heed his ministers, and ministers who embrace the vast to illuminate their ruler?\n\nYet knowing the way to Peace lies in the exchange of departures and arrivals, one also knows that such exchanges cannot endure. Peace is difficult to preserve—this too must be considered. Thus, within the inner trigram at the third line and the outer trigram at the top, it is uniquely emphasized. The \"boundary of Heaven and Earth\" speaks of their juncture. The union of Heaven and Earth, once united, disperses; once joined, separates—it cannot last. For level and incline, advance and return, sincerity is evident, yet this is not something human effort can control. Yet knowing this and steadfastly enduring hardship, one may avoid the blame of great adversity, the blame of incline, the blame of advance. Why? Human determination can overcome Heaven.\n\nThus, it warns: \"Do not worry over its sincerity.\" If sincerity is thus, and one assumes Peace must advance, merely knowing this and enduring hardship to preserve it—without treating it as perpetual—can sustain Peace. Then one may not only avoid the blame of great adversity but also long enjoy the fortune of Peace. Hence: \"In nourishment, there is fortune.\" Thus, if you but endure hardship, Peace will not depart. Though there be constant patterns, what can they do to you?\n\nThe third line, at the top of the lower trigram, marks the juncture of Peace’s exchange—hence special attention is given. The top line, at the extreme of Peace, sees the city wall collapse into the moat, reverting from above to below. Do not mobilize the masses—they will not heed. Why? Above and below do not unite. From the capital, decrees are issued—its mandate is already in chaos. Though one wishes to endure hardship, it is no longer possible. Alas! Should one not be warned early?\n\n**Appendix:**\nFeng Qi said: After Qian and Kun, one first enters the human Dao, traversing six Kan trigrams, experiencing all hardships and dangers, accumulating within and treading without—only then is Peace achieved. Yet after Peace, Adversity follows, revealing how difficult it is for humanity to stand and how easily chaos arises. This is the profound intent of those who arranged the *Yi*.\n\nWang Fusi said: Cogon grass, when pulled, has roots that connect and draw together. *Ru* describes this connected appearance. The three yang lines share the same aspiration, all directed outward. The first is of its kind; when the leader rises, the kind follows. Hence: \"advancing with its kind—auspicious in advancement.\"\n\nCheng Zhengshu said: The *Xiang* cites \"embracing the vast\" to comprehensively explain the meaning of the four lines. It says that thus one can align with the virtue of the central conduct, and one’s Dao will be luminous and grand.\n\nShi Shoudao said: Beyond the second line, \"level without incline\"; beyond the fifth, \"the city wall collapses into the moat.\"\n\nYang Tingxiu said: Level and incline alternate; advance and return shift. Those in an age of Peace must not assume the times are level—danger will soon arise. They must not assume yin has departed—its return is swift. Nine Three is the extreme of yang’s flourishing. Yin will return, Peace will turn to Adversity. Should one not fear? Why? The juncture of Heaven and Earth’s exchange, the interplay of yin and yang, lies between Nine Three and Six Four.\n\nJin Rubai said: \"Attaining esteem in the center\" is like a feudal lord marrying a princess.",

      "translated_text": "The virtue of Nine Two enables it to esteem the central conduct of Six Five as its lord.\n\nWang Fusi further said: Dwelling at the utmost of *Tai* (Peace), each returns to its counterpart—thus the Dao of *Tai* is about to perish. Above and below do not interact; the lowly do not ascend to serve, the exalted do not descend to bestow. Hence, \"the city wall collapses into the moat.\" \"Do not mobilize troops\"—no need for attack. \"From the city, proclamations are issued\"—this is the *Pi* (Adversity) Dao’s steadfast constraint, where commands already issued cannot be executed.\n\nMaster Po (Su Shi) explained: Taking earth from the moat to build a city, raising and fortifying it—this is not for the city’s benefit, but for the people’s. When *Kun* (Earth) is above and seeks to return below, it is like earth made into a wall longing to return to the moat. When the above loses its defense, the below schemes to usurp command. Thus it is said: \"From the city, proclamations are issued.\" A city is not where commands should originate.\n\n*Kun* below, *Qian* above—*Pi*’s \"not the proper person.\" \"Not advantageous.\" \"The great departs, the small arrives.\"\n\nThe *Xiang* (Image) says: \"*Pi*’s 'not the proper person'—not advantageous. The noble person’s steadfastness. The great departs, the small arrives\"—this means Heaven and Earth do not interact, and the myriad things are not connected. Above and below do not interact, and the realm has no guiding state. Within, yin; without, yang. Within, softness; without, hardness. Within, the petty person; without, the noble person. The petty person’s Dao grows, the noble person’s Dao wanes.\n\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Heaven and Earth do not interact—*Pi*.\" The noble person, through frugal virtue, avoids calamity; one must not seek glory through emolument.\n\n**First Six:** \"Pulling cogon grass, roots entwined—by its kind. Steadfastness brings good fortune and smoothness.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Pulling cogon grass—steadfastness brings good fortune,\" for the aspiration lies with the lord.\n\n**Six Two:** \"Enveloping and submitting—petty persons find good fortune; great persons find adversity, yet smoothness.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Great persons find adversity, yet smoothness,\" for they do not disrupt the group.\n\n**Six Three:** \"Enveloping shame.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Enveloping shame,\" for the position is not appropriate.\n\n**Nine Four:** \"Having mandate, no blame. Companions partake in blessing.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Having mandate, no blame,\" for the aspiration is fulfilled.\n\n**Nine Five:** \"Ceasing adversity—great persons find good fortune. 'It may perish! It may perish!'—as if striking the roots of the mulberry.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Great persons’ good fortune,\" for the position is correct and fitting.\n\n**Top Nine:** \"Overturning adversity—first adversity, then joy.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"When adversity ends, it overturns—how can it last long?\"\n\nHeaven and Earth in *Pi* (Adversity). Only when the small departs and the great arrives—with a single interaction—is *Tai* (Peace) achieved. Thus, when the great departs and the small arrives, the lack of interaction forms *Pi*. Therefore, the way to bring about *Pi* lies entirely in \"not the proper person.\"\n\nWhat is meant by \"not the proper person\"? It is because they claim the noble person’s steadfastness, yet the great do not come, the small do not depart, and there is no interaction—hence *Pi*. Some ask: \"Steadfastness means correctness. If steadfastness itself is not advantageous, why does it say 'not advantageous for the noble person’s steadfastness'? Moreover, First Six’s 'pulling cogon grass, roots entwined' is also linked to steadfastness, good fortune, and smoothness. Yet yin’s softness, entwined in kind, is the very opposite of steadfastness—why does the sage reverse this, calling it steadfast, good, and capable of smoothing adversity?\"\n\nIt is said: This is yin departing to interact with yang, knowing only that the small should depart but entirely unaware that the noble person’s steadfastness should not depart. Thus, as this departs and that arrives, this does not see itself as petty, nor does that see itself as noble. Not seeing itself as petty is the absence of the petty person—thus the petty person’s Dao wanes. Not seeing itself as noble means both are noble—thus the noble person’s Dao grows, and growth brings *Tai*. Observing this Dao, all is small departing and great arriving—hence the way to bring about *Pi* is evident.\n\nNow, if one wishes to reverse *Pi* and achieve *Tai*, how can one still claim to possess the noble person’s steadfastness alone? Precisely because one has steadfastness, one is \"not the proper person.\" Thus it is said: \"*Pi*’s 'not the proper person'—smoothness.\" *Pi* is something to contemplate.\n\nTherefore, with First Six’s \"pulling cogon grass, roots entwined,\" its aspiration lies with the lord—thus Nine Four’s companions partake in blessing, its aspiration fulfilled, and above and below interact. Nine Four dwells at the lower position of the upper trigram, holding the incipient signs of *Tai*’s return and the mandate’s imminent restoration. Moreover, it occupies the position of a great minister, near the lord’s domain. Having fulfilled its aspiration, it naturally incurs no blame, and all kinds align with its fortune. This is not merely \"pulling cogon grass, roots entwined.\"\n\nFour is the lord of First, hence \"aspiration lies with the lord.\" Therefore, with Six Two’s way of smoothing adversity, it naturally envelops and submits, making petty persons all find good fortune—what steadfastness is there? With Nine Five’s great person’s method of ceasing adversity, the great person naturally finds good fortune—not merely making petty persons find good fortune—what adversity remains?\n\nYet having said \"ceasing adversity,\" it seems at first not to regard adversity as a concern—how could one know that within, it is truly arduous, steadfast, and unyielding, constantly saying, \"It may perish! It may perish!\"—as if striking the roots of the mulberry. How could one consider this a momentary absence of self-preservation? \"First adversity, then joy\"—its impermanence is fitting.\n\nLi Tuweng said: The way to preserve *Tai* lies above all in *Qian*. The way to smooth *Pi* lies above all in *Kun*. *Qian* is Heaven—Heaven’s origin does not cover, thus Nine Two alone, with its capacity to envelop the wild, presides over *Tai*. *Kun* is Earth—Earth’s origin does not bear, thus Six Two alone, with its way of enveloping, submitting, and compliance, smooths *Pi*. Yet though *Tai* governs the world with enveloping vastness, it truly conducts itself with arduous steadfastness—hence it is said: \"Arduous steadfastness—no blame.\" This is what is meant by King Wen, from morning till the sun passed noon, having no leisure even to eat.\n\nThough *Pi* treats others with enveloping submission, it truly rests in its ominous cessation of adversity—hence it is said: \"Its ominousness—its ominousness—ominousness without end. Where will it return?\" This is what is meant by Goujian tasting gall and sleeping on brushwood. Nevertheless, when *Tai* prevails, all believe it to be *Tai*, yet I alone regard it as *Pi*—thus I am not swayed by *Tai* and can make *Tai* enduringly *Tai*.",
      "overlap_context": "; advance and return shift. Those in an age of Peace must not assume the times are level—danger will soon arise. They must not assume yin has departed—its return is swift. Nine Three is the extreme of yang’s flourishing. Yin will return, Peace will turn to Adversity. Should one not fear? Why? The juncture of Heaven and Earth’s exchange, the interplay of yin and yang, lies between Nine Three and Six Four.\n\nJin Rubai said: \"Attaining esteem in the center\" is like a feudal lord marrying a princess.",

      "translated_text": "When *Pi* prevails, all believe it to be *Pi*, yet I alone regard it as *Tai*—thus I am not disturbed by *Pi* and can ensure *Pi* does not remain *Pi* to the end.\n\nThis inverted conduct, this counterflow, keeps the hilt of *Tai’e* ever in my grasp—truly the great one who brings *Pi* to rest. Yet the noble person does not undertake this—why? Because the noble person possesses steadfastness. With steadfastness, seeing others as unsteadfast, one will not go forth—how then can one avoid *Pi*? Only by \"plucking the creeping grass, its kind all drawn together,\" when yin softness unites in mutual connection, does steadfastness arise. Only by enveloping submission, enduring shame, and ensuring that what goes forth does not return, does steadfastness arise. With steadfastness comes smoothness, rest, and good fortune—thus it becomes *Tai*.\n\nHence it is said: \"Enveloping and submitting to the petty person—good fortune.\" Merely by enveloping and submitting to make the petty person prosper, one embodies the great one’s way of smoothing *Pi*—no need to wait for another day to achieve smoothness.\n\nSome ask: The second nine envelops the vast, attains eminence through the center, and in action becomes the way of *Tai*—this is entirely enveloping the vast. Why then does the line also speak of \"crossing the river\" and \"cliques bringing misfortune\"? Beyond enveloping the vast, must one also employ the courage of \"crossing the river\"? Beyond not neglecting the distant, must one also sever cliquish partiality? Not so. One who truly envelops the vast without neglecting the distant naturally severs cliquish partiality and bravely \"crosses the river.\" Otherwise, one is merely a vacillating, indecisive man.\n\nAs when Emperor Yuan of Western Han hoped for Xiang’s execution yet did not know how to restrain Dou Xian of Eastern Han, who seized the sovereign’s fields and gardens—what did he gain by \"enveloping the vast\"? Thus, though strong, one must weaken; though orderly, one must fall into chaos—how can there be any glory or attainment of the central path? The line encompasses this meaning, hence its detailed exposition.\n\n**Appendix**\nLǚ Bogong said: *Pi* is the disunion of above and below, possessing the form of Heaven and Earth but lacking their efficacy.\n\nDèng Bogao said: The second, centered and correct, assists the great lord in bringing *Pi* to rest—hence the method of enveloping and submitting to the petty person.\n\nThe third, yin-soft in *Pi*, at times endures shame to heed the petty person’s clamor, or endures shame to join the petty person’s faction.\n\nLi Sheng said: This is precisely the method of dwelling in *Pi*—what is called \"spitting on one’s face and letting it dry,\" or \"stripping off one’s robe and gambling freely.\" As for Li Gu’s execution, what did it profit the Han but to fan the flames of Liang Ji’s tyranny? Not only was it of no benefit, but it greatly harmed the state. Thus, the line does not attach good fortune, misfortune, regret, or remorse to enduring shame, and the *Xiang* merely notes its improper position. For it is neither the position of the great lord at nine-five nor that of the great minister at nine-four—what can it do but watch for opportunity?\n\nThe compliance of Chen Ping and others, who flattered and followed the will of the king and the Lü clan, serves as an example. What is called \"the great one smoothing *Pi* without confusion\" is truly so. Hence it is said: \"To rebuke at court today, a remonstrating minister is not as effective as a decisive sovereign; to secure the altars of state and the Liu succession, a later lord is not as effective as a minister.\" Alas, who would say enduring shame is truly inappropriate? Reading this, one can only weep. Such words are truly difficult to speak to others. Only those with a true heart, unbetraying of person, family, or state, will silently understand.\n\nXióng Guo said: *Xiū* (rest) means people resting in the shade of trees; *bāo sāng* (bundled mulberry) refers to the budding of tender mulberry shoots, as in the *Odes*’ \"mutual bundling of the boxthorn.\"\n\nDèng Bogao further said: *Bāo sāng* is not a metaphor for solid bonds but resembles the ancients’ \"rotting rope driving six horses\" or \"treading on a tiger’s tail and spring ice.\" In Lu Xuangong’s *Memorial Requesting the Cessation of Troops After the Recovery of Hebei*, he wrote: \"The state’s pillars, darkly and continuously linked, are like bundled mulberry, gracefully entwined—fortunate not to snap, though threadlike.\" Thus, *bāo* means clustered growth. Clustered mulberry, thin and weak—how can it bear heavy ties?\n\nShào Guoxián said: *Pi* and *Tai* are matters of timing. Timing is what the ruler and the noble person bring about. Thus, the *Xiang* of *Tai* says \"the way of the ruler is above,\" while the *Xiang* of *Pi* says \"the way of the noble person is below.\" In the time of *Tai*, wealth and assistance are complete, and the noble person joins in—what strength is needed? Now it is otherwise—this is called \"frugal virtue.\"\n\n**Li** (Fire below Heaven): *Tóngrén* (Fellowship) in the wild—smooth. Favorable to ford the great river; favorable for the noble person’s steadfastness.\n\nThe *Tuan* says: *Tóngrén*—the soft attains position and the center, responding to *qián*, hence \"fellowship.\" \"Fellowship in the wild—smooth; favorable to ford the great river\"—*qián* is in motion. Illuminating and strong, centered and correct, responding—this is the noble person’s steadfastness. Only the noble person can unite the world’s aspirations.\n\nThe *Xiang* says: Heaven and fire—*tóngrén*. The noble person thereby classifies clans and distinguishes things.\n\n**First Nine**: Fellowship at the gate—no blame.\nThe *Xiang* says: Going forth to fellowship—who would blame this?\n\n**Six Two**: Fellowship within the clan—regret.\nThe *Xiang* says: Fellowship within the clan—this is the way of regret.\n\n**Nine Three**: Hiding troops in the thicket, ascending the high mound—three years without rising.\nThe *Xiang* says: Hiding troops in the thicket—opposing the firm. Three years without rising—how can one act?\n\n**Nine Four**: Mounting the ramparts, not attacking—good fortune.\nThe *Xiang* says: Mounting the ramparts—righteousness does not permit attack. Its good fortune lies in being constrained and returning to principle.\n\n**Nine Five**: Fellowship—first wailing and weeping, then laughing. The great armies meet.\nThe *Xiang* says: The beginning of fellowship—centered and upright.

Yet the fifth line finds it easy to possess greatness, while the second struggles to serve as the clan’s standard—this is the distinction between above and below, the difference in the power of honor and humility.\n\nThus, in *Great Possession*, the sixth five alone achieves supreme fortune in greatness, while in *Fellowship*, the six two cannot avoid the regret of being bound to the clan. Yet though the six two may see itself as burdened by the clan’s regret, the five yang regard it as truly in fellowship with the wilds. Therefore, the *Tuan* commentary settles on the four characters \"fellowship in the wilds\" to name the hexagram.\n\nFrom a present perspective: the first line emerges from the gate in search of fellowship. The third conceals troops in the thicket in search of fellowship. The fourth mounts the ramparts in search of fellowship. The fifth alone wails and weeps, raising great armies to seek fellowship. And the top line ventures to the outskirts, gazing afar, hoping for even a single moment of fellowship. Thus, the five yang above and below all take the second as their standard, desiring to join in fellowship—this is evident. What they all share is the fellowship of the entire hexagram; if not the fellowship of the wilds, then what?\n\nThe four-character hexagram name appears only here and in \"Adversity’s\" \"not of the people.\" As for \"Treading the tiger’s tail\" or \"Stilling one’s back,\" these three-character hexagram names follow another pattern. Yet this hexagram is truly named *Fellowship* because the second and fifth share a single heart. Thus, the *Tuan* commentary first speaks of fellowship, saying: \"The soft attains its position, attains the center, and responds to Qian—this is fellowship.\" \"Responds to Qian\" refers specifically to the fifth line.\n\nIf this is so, then why does the hexagram *Fellowship* say: \"Fellowship in the wilds, prosperity, beneficial to ford the great river\"? It means not only that the fifth responds to the second, desiring fellowship with it, but that all of Qian’s movements seek to respond to the second, to join in fellowship with it. Thus, it says \"Qian moves\"—this is clear. The reason lies in the six two’s civil brilliance and strength, its centered correctness and responsiveness, possessing the rectitude of the noble person. Rectitude unites the aspirations of all under heaven—how could this apply only to the fifth?\n\nThus, the fellowship of the wilds, the benefit of fording the river, the prosperity of fellowship—what doubt remains? Yet there are inevitably disputes from the third and fourth lines, and the overcoming of the nine five. Its nearness may seem regrettable, leading to the regret attributed to the second line. But if the six two truly possesses the steadfastness of the noble person—centered, correct, and responsive—then nothing can harm its fellowship in the wilds. If it truly has the power to sever metal like shared words, the fragrance of orchids, then the mutual trust between the second and fifth—how could the third and fourth contend against it? Though I may be seen as regrettable, I will not be concerned.\n\nThis is why the Master, in the *Wenyan*, concludes with the words of two people in fellowship: \"like the severing of metal, the shared heart’s words, the fragrance of orchids.\" Alas! The transmission between Yao and Shun, between Confucius and Yan—flowing to the damp, following the clouds with the wind, responding to sound and seeking qi—how could there be any regret? Thus, King Wen was moved by the nine five, and the Master by the six two.\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Shi’s explanation: \"Beneficial to ford the great river—this is Qian’s movement. If one does not achieve sincere fellowship, one may unite in times of peace but dissolve when fording the river.\"\n\nTu Xi says: \"The six two does not merely respond to the nine five’s Qian; all those with whom it fellowships are Qian. To move with Qian—what is fording a river to this? A single Qian is already unbearable; how much more five Qian? The noble person may rejoice in this without ceasing.\"\n\nSu Shi’s interpretation of \"sincere fellowship\" to explain \"Qian’s movement\" seems unclear. \"Sincere fellowship\" refers to the second and fifth lines. \"Qian’s movement\" refers to the five yang’s movement, the fellowship of the wilds.\n\nSu Shi also says: \"The first nine emerges from within to fellowship with others; the top nine enters from without to fellowship with those below. Emerging from within is called the gate; entering from without is called the outskirts.\"\n\nTu Weng says: \"Emerging from the gate—this is fellowship. Emerging from the gate is immediately in fellowship with the second, with no separation. Thus it says: 'Who would blame this?'—meaning, who would cause them not to achieve fellowship? This is the fortunate phrase of the first line. The fifth is different: 'In the heart, they are in fellowship—how could I forget it?' This refers to the second and fifth. There is no room for not being in fellowship—how could there be regret? If there were regret, the nine five would certainly not raise great armies to brave the multitude and seek encounter.\"\n\nThus, Su Shi says: \"The Way of the noble person may involve going forth or staying, silence or speech. When two hearts are as one, their power can sever metal. The words of shared hearts have the fragrance of orchids.\" From this, how could one slight the nine five for using armies? Though the third and fourth are strong and cannot seize it, beginning with wailing and weeping and ending in laughter, even to the point of armies overcoming one another—they cannot break their fellowship. This reveals the sincerity of the second and fifth’s fellowship.\n\nThe second is yin; the fifth is yang. Yin and yang differ yet become *Fellowship*—thus we know their fellowship is certain. The noble person may differ in going forth, staying, speaking, or silence, yet become *Fellowship*—thus we know their fellowship is certain. If it is certain, then even the hardest and strongest things cannot intervene. Thus it says: \"Their power can sever metal.\"\n\nTu Weng says: \"Li Bai followed Prince Yong of Lin and was sentenced to death. Guo Ziyi offered his rank and titles to ransom him. Later, Bai was again imprisoned in Xunyang.\"",

      "translated_text": "Song Ruosi deployed three thousand troops to repel and reclaim him. Alas! In an age devoid of like-minded companions, where may the great worthies and noble persons entrust their lives? This is why, in the *Fellowship* of the wilds, the sage does not take it as the model.\n\nXiong Guo says: *Fellowship* and *Great Possession* are both hexagrams of five yang lines with one yin. In *Great Possession*, the ruling yin resides in the fifth line, hence it is said to be \"supremely prosperous.\" In *Fellowship*, the yin resides in the second line, yet the yang lines honor it as their ancestor—thus it is called \"prosperous\" and \"the steadfastness of the noble person.\" *Ancestor* means \"honored.\" As the *Book of Songs* says: \"The noble person honors it; though their aspirations are not yet fulfilled, they unite the aspirations of all under Heaven.\" This is the reversal and rectification.\n\nJiang Tingshan says: \"Lying in ambush in the thickets, awaiting the fifth line’s vulnerability, ascending the high mound to observe the second line’s movements—yet after three years, they do not rise, for the fifth line ultimately cannot be disrespected.\"\n\n---\n**Qian below, Li above**\n**Great Possession: Supreme prosperity.**\n\n*The Judgment* says: *Great Possession*—the yielding attains the honored position, great and central, with all below responding to it, hence \"Great Possession.\" Its virtue is firm and strong, radiant and bright, responding to Heaven and acting in accord with the seasons—thus it is \"supremely prosperous.\"\n\n*The Image* says: Fire above Heaven is *Great Possession*. The noble person thereby suppresses evil and extols good, following Heaven’s gracious mandate.\n\n**First Nine:** At the outset, exchanges bring harm, yet no blame. In hardship, there is no blame.\n*The Image* says: In *Great Possession’s* first nine, exchanges at the outset bring harm.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** With a great wagon for bearing, there is somewhere to go—no blame.\n*The Image* says: With a great wagon for bearing, the accumulation within does not fail.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** The duke offers sacrifice to the Son of Heaven; the petty man cannot.\n*The Image* says: The duke offers sacrifice to the Son of Heaven—this is harmful for the petty man.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Not in its fullness—no blame.\n*The Image* says: Not in its fullness—no blame, for it is bright, discerning, and wise.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Its sincerity is interwoven, its majesty is manifest—good fortune.\n*The Image* says: Its sincerity is interwoven, for trust gives rise to aspiration. The good fortune of manifest majesty lies in ease without excess.\n\n**Top Nine:** From Heaven comes aid—good fortune, nothing not beneficial.\n*The Image* says: The good fortune of *Great Possession’s* top line comes from Heaven’s aid.\n\n---\n**Fire over Heaven: Great Possession**\n\nFang Shihua says: Su Shi observed that all great things are seen as possessed by the fifth line, hence \"Great Possession.\" In the age of *Great Possession*, all below respond to the fifth, serving with interwoven sincerity and manifest majesty. The fifth lord, in turn, responds to Heaven and acts in accord with the seasons to enjoy *Great Possession*, receiving Heaven’s aid—good fortune, nothing not beneficial. For one born into such times, navigating the world is already fraught, and the web of connections ever widens—truly, it is arduous. One must not hastily assume it is easy.\n\nThe first nine, at the lowest position, is still in the initial stage of exchange. Yet exchange begins here. Initial exchange thus brings initial harm—one knows that exchange inevitably entails harm. Therefore, it is taught the way to avoid blame: avoiding blame lies solely in overcoming hardship. If one can overcome hardship, then even daily engagement with the world—what harm could there be? Thus, the second nine, with a great wagon, does not fail. Not failing is to avoid harm.\n\nThe third nine, offering sacrifice to the Son of Heaven, may be a duke. As a duke offering sacrifice, there is no harm. The fourth nine, not in its fullness, dwells in abundance yet knows fear; knowing fear, there is again no harm. Thus, harm lies in the person. Only when one indulges in *Great Possession* without knowing hardship to govern it does one gradually fall into harm—what has this to do with exchange?\n\nNow observe the third nine: occupying the top of the lower trigram, it is the duke’s position. With firmness in the correct place, it is fit to share the Son of Heaven’s great fortune in *Great Possession*. For it deeply knows hardship and can be cautious from the outset—like the Grand Duke of Qi. But the likes of Han Xin and Peng Yue brought harm upon themselves and could not endure, for they knew not hardship.\n\nThe fourth nine is perilously close to the fifth six, at the height of abundance. Yet as yang dwelling in yin, it alone can exhaust all it possesses, making it the lord’s possession while daring not claim the slightest for itself—hence \"not in its fullness,\" for it is bright, discerning, and wise. Only with true wisdom surpassing others can one deeply know hardship and be so cautious to the end—like Tao Zhugong and Zhang Zifang.\n\nFrom this, I observe: in the age of *Great Possession*, the lord is yielding and central, the minister overcomes hardship; the lord has interwoven sincerity, the minister’s initial exchanges bring no harm—only then can they together enjoy the fortune of *Great Possession*. Otherwise, misfortune and blame will come. Thus, the lord’s increasing yielding and the minister’s increasing hardship are the sage’s subtle intent.\n\nWang Benhe says: The top nine, \"from Heaven comes aid,\" is because the fifth six responds to Heaven and acts in accord with the seasons to attain supreme prosperity.\n\n---\n**Appendix**\nCheng Zhengshu says: \"The duke offers sacrifice to the Son of Heaven\"—if a petty man occupies this position, it becomes harmful. Since ancient times, feudal lords who could loyally and obediently serve their superiors nurtured their people as shields and bulwarks for the king, enriching their resources to await the ruler’s levies. If a petty man occupies this position, with a numerous people and abundant wealth, they will instead arrogate their prosperity and strength, becoming ever more disobedient—thus, *Great Possession* becomes harmful for the petty man. Moreover, *Great Possession* is the petty man’s harm.\n\nZhang Youyu says: The *Book of Songs* says: \"The messengers are vigorous, the chariots are vigorous, the teams of four are vigorous, the four steeds are vigorous\"—all conveying the sense of flourishing strength.\n\nYang Tingshu says: The fifth six is the lord of *Great Possession*.",

      "translated_text": "With clarity yet veiling it, holding it with the emptiness of yin at the center, and entrusting it solely to softness and sincerity—thus can one stir the aspirations of those below. The spirits submit to the hearts of those below; when those below are stirred, the sincerity between ruler and minister becomes firm without need for covenant. When the spirits of those below submit, the majesty of the Dao and virtue harmonizes without need for severity.\n\nSincerity stirs aspiration: with my own sincerity, I stir their sincerity. Gentleness without excess: with my own harmony and ease, I penetrate their defenses. Wang Fusi says: Dwelling in honor with softness, abiding in greatness with centeredness, without selfishness toward things—above and below respond to this. Sincerity stirs aspiration, thus their sincerity intermingles like flowing water. Without selfishness toward things, things too become impartial; without doubt toward things, things too become sincere. Being both impartial and sincere, what difficulty or defense remains? Teaching spreads without words, and majesty arises without effort. If one were to be the lord of *Great Possession* yet not attain good fortune through this Dao, how could it be possible?\n\nSu Shi’s explanation says: The fifth six dwells amid the abundance of firmness yet alone employs softness—this is the utmost lack of defense. Precisely because of this lack of defense, things trust it, and thus those who return to it intermingle like flowing water. How can this softness yet possess majesty? Because it lacks excess, knowing it has abundance. Defense arises from insufficiency; when the form of insufficiency appears outwardly, majesty wanes. It is also said: What Heaven assists is compliance; what people assist is trust. Treading trust and contemplating compliance, and moreover esteeming worthiness—thus is one aided by Heaven, and good fortune, with nothing not beneficial. Trust, compliance, and esteeming worthiness—these are the virtues of the fifth six. Gentleness without excess—this is the compliance of the fifth six. Its sincerity intermingling like flowing water—this is the trust of the fifth six. The masses return to it—this is the esteeming of worthiness of the fifth six. The top nine uniquely treads this: what you tread is both compliant and trustworthy, and moreover esteems worthiness—then to whom will the aid of Heaven and humanity turn? Thus it is said: The sage has no merit, the spirit has no name—and the top nine of *Great Possession* does not reveal the source of its blessings.\n\nLiu Yongxiang says: The fifth six alone fully expounds the virtue by which the fifth six attains *Great Possession*. The top nine alone fully expounds the good fortune by which the fifth six attains *Great Possession*. With both fortune and virtue complete, this is *Great Possession*. The fifth six and the top nine unite as one. Thus, the top nine—it is Heaven.\n\n**Below and Earth above: Humility.** *Humility*: Flourishing. The noble person brings things to completion.\n\n*The Judgment* says: *Humility*—flourishing. The Dao of Heaven descends and brings illumination; the Dao of Earth is lowly yet ascends. The Dao of Heaven diminishes the full and augments the humble; the Dao of Earth alters the full and flows to the humble. Ghosts and spirits harm the full and bless the humble; the Dao of humanity detests the full and loves the humble. Humility is honored and radiant, lowly yet unblemished—this is the noble person’s completion.\n\n*The Image* says: Within Earth there is a mountain—*Humility*. The noble person reduces the many to benefit the few, weighing things to bestow evenly.\n\n**First six:** The humbly humble noble person—crossing the great river brings good fortune.\n*The Image* says: The humbly humble noble person—using lowliness to cultivate the self.\n\n**Second six:** Resonant humility—constancy brings good fortune.\n*The Image* says: Resonant humility—constancy brings good fortune, for the center is attained.\n\n**Third nine:** The toiling and humble noble person—bringing things to completion brings good fortune.\n*The Image* says: The toiling and humble noble person—all the people submit.\n\n**Fourth six:** Without excess, vigorously practicing humility.\n*The Image* says: Without excess, vigorously practicing humility—this is not transgressing the norm.\n\n**Fifth six:** Not wealthy, yet with one’s neighbors—beneficial to employ in punitive expeditions, without excess.\n*The Image* says: Beneficial to employ in punitive expeditions—punishing the disobedient.\n\n**Top six:** Resonant humility—beneficial to employ in military campaigns, punishing city-states.\n*The Image* says: Resonant humility—the aspiration is not yet attained. It is permissible to employ in military campaigns, punishing city-states.\n\n**Earth above Mountain: Humility.** *Humility*—flourishing. The noble person brings things to completion.\n\nIt has already spoken of flourishing—why then speak of the noble person’s completion? Completion contrasts with beginning. That *humility* must flourish is beyond doubt; *The Judgment* has already expounded this in detail. Yet generally, for the noble person who is modest and yielding, there may be times at the beginning when flourishing is not assured, but in the end, flourishing is beyond doubt. The sage fears that seeing the lack of flourishing at the beginning, one might become uneasy with humility, and thus emphasizes completion.\n\nKing Wen’s humility, surpassing even that of Taibo and King Wen—when Taibo thrice yielded the world to Jili, cutting his hair, tattooing his body, and fleeing to the barbarians of Jing, this was distress without flourishing, reaching the limits of what human sentiment could endure. Yet in the end, he gloriously possessed the state of Wu—this was Taibo’s noble completion. King Wen, yielding two-thirds of the world to Shang, could also be called diminishing the self to give to others, like King Tai’s affair with the Di. What flourishing was there? Yet in the end, he established the eight-hundred-year Zhou—this was King Wen’s noble completion. Thus the Master judged these two sages as possessing the highest virtue. This hexagram further clarifies that *humility* must flourish, and the intent is evident.\n\nThus it is said: If you do not boast, none in the world will contend with you in ability. If you do not vaunt, none in the world will contend with you in merit. Was it only after the four hundred years of the Xia that Yu’s humility, truly without contenders in merit and ability, became apparent? Kongzi and Yan Hui, humbly humble and untried, yet in the end became the teachers of the world for ten thousand generations—this is the greatest and most manifest of the noble person’s completion.\n\nThe hexagram speaks of *humility* flourishing and again speaks of completion—how profound! The hexagram speaks of the noble person’s completion, yet the line alone speaks of the noble person’s completion bringing good fortune—how could there be no intent? For the third nine is the lord of the hexagram—the toiling and humble one.",

      "translated_text": "The rest merely echo humility or respond in humility. Alas! To toil without boasting, to achieve merit without claiming virtue—this is the utmost of generosity. One whose virtue is profound casts a deep radiance; the giver will surely reap its recompense. That the noble person’s completion brings good fortune—why should there be any doubt regarding the third nine? **Appendix:**\n\nXiong Guo says: The lower position is called \"humble-humble.\"\nFang Shihua says: Lowliness is not humility; it is through lowliness that humility is revealed. Hence it is said: \"Use lowliness to cultivate the self.\" The character *mu* (牧, \"to cultivate\") in *Shuowen* is composed of *zhi* (支), which is interchangeable with *pu* (扑, \"to strike\"), and *niu* (牛, \"ox\"), meaning \"one who tends oxen.\" The ox is a massive creature, symbolizing human strength and yang; when it is tamed and submissive, there is the Way of cultivation. Su Shi explains: When the male crows, the female responds, so the *Yi* uses the interplay of yin and yang to convey the resonance of humility. The essence of humility lies in the third line. *Gen*’s control rests in the third, and the third humbly places *Gen* below *Kun*—its humility is extreme, hence it is called \"toiling humility.\" The second six is its neighbor, the upper six its mate, so both harmonize with it and echo humility. Moreover, the second six, being yin and positioned in the center of the inner trigram, is thus called \"steadfast and auspicious.\" *Wu* (呜, \"to echo\") describes their harmony; *zhen* (贞, \"steadfast\") in the third shows that this arises from nature, not compulsion.\n\nJiao Ruohou says: *Dao* (捣, \"to pound\") means to break apart. It is composed of *shou* (手, \"hand\") and *gao* (高, \"high\") as phonetic, and is interchangeable with *hui* (麾, \"to wave\"). In the *Book of Songs*, it appears as \"waving with the arm,\" and in the *Book of Documents* as \"holding a white banner to wave\"—it is also written as *dao*. Yang Jian says: Six yin lines, four yin lines, the body of *Kun* being yin, and not centered—this presents the image of excessive humility. Thus the sage teaches to \"pound away\" this humility, yet fearing doubt, adds \"nothing is not advantageous\" to *pounding humility*. It says: \"If it does not transgress principle,\" meaning that even when pounding away humility, it does not reach the point of transgression.\n\nCheng Zhengshu says: To subdue through civil virtue—this is what humility and compliance cannot achieve. If civil virtue cannot subdue, yet one does not employ might and martial power, how can the world be governed? Here humility has gone too far. The Bald Elder says: *Kun*’s excess in humility may stem from fear of harm or disadvantage. Now, with *Kun*’s compliant hexagram and the fourth six’s line, yielding and compliance reach their utmost. Upholding this compliance, not daring to transgress principle—though it brings no disadvantage—if one adds humility, is this not too excessive? Excess invites contempt; this is not humility. Thus the upper three lines all instruct to \"pound away\" humility, making use of punitive expeditions. In sum, it is not about waging war over a neighbor’s wealth; if there are those who refuse to submit, how can one not strike? This is like Tang’s campaign against Ge. The upper six reaches the extreme of humility and compliance. If it still echoes in harmony, does the third nine’s humility not become excessive? Even within one’s own domain, can one truly have one’s way? This is like the Duke of Zhou’s eastern campaign. Thus do I recognize the sage’s skill in discoursing on humility. The inner three lines emphasize restraint, so their virtue is displayed; the outer three lines emphasize compliance, so their excess is guarded against. The sage’s way of gathering the abundant to supplement the deficient is like this.\n\nWang Ji says: Concealing the high within the low—this is the image of humility. The noble person takes from the surplus to benefit the deficient, so that the worthy and unworthy are equalized. By lowering one’s position before others, the noble and base are equalized. None of humility’s six lines are inauspicious. Humility means inner restraint and outer compliance. If one lacks inner restraint but maintains outer compliance, this becomes feigned reverence and affected dignity—something the noble person does not value.\n\n**Hexagram 16: Yu (豫, \"Delight\")**\n*Below Kun (坤, \"The Receptive\"), above Zhen (震, \"The Arousing\")*\n**Yu:** Favorable for establishing lords and deploying armies.\n\n**The Judgment:**\n*Yu*: The firm finds resonance, and its will is carried out. Compliant yet active—this is *Yu*. *Yu* is compliant yet active, so heaven and earth follow its pattern—how could it not be favorable for establishing lords and deploying armies? Heaven and earth move in compliance, so the sun and moon do not err, and the four seasons do not falter. The sage moves in compliance, so punishments are clear and the people submit. The timeliness of *Yu*—how great it is!\n\n**The Image:**\nThunder emerges from the earth, arousing—this is *Yu*. The former kings, in accordance with this, composed music to exalt virtue, offering it reverently to the Supreme Emperor and pairing it with ancestral spirits.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Six:** Echoing delight—misfortune.\n**The Image:** The initial six’s echoing delight—its will is exhausted, hence misfortune.\n\n**Six in the Second:** Firm as stone, not a full day—steadfast and auspicious.\n**The Image:** \"Not a full day, steadfast and auspicious\"—this is due to central correctness.\n\n**Six in the Third:** Sighing in delight—regret. Delay brings regret.\n**The Image:** \"Sighing in delight brings regret\"—its position is not appropriate.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Deriving delight—great attainment. Do not doubt. Friends gather like hairpins.\n**The Image:** \"Deriving delight, great attainment\"—its will is greatly fulfilled.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Steadfast in illness—constantly on the verge of death.\n**The Image:** The fifth six’s steadfast illness—it rides the firm. \"Constantly on the verge of death\"—its center has not yet perished.\n\n**Upper Six:** Dark delight—if it reaches completion, there will be change; no blame.\n**The Image:** \"Dark delight in the upper position\"—how can this last long?\n\n**Hexagram 16: Thunder over Earth (Yu)**\nFang Shihua says: Of *Yu*’s six lines, except for the fourth nine, which delights in the world and attains great success, the rest all err through delight. Only the second six, centered and correct, guards itself and refuses to follow others. Though it partakes in delight, it is \"not a full day\"—this is the nature of its steadfast integrity. Is there anything inauspicious here? The *Great Commentary*’s discussion of \"knowing the incipient\" precisely warns of *Yu*’s inevitable misfortune. Only the second six’s firm-as-stone resolve can foresee the incipient and thus avoid being submerged in delight. The third line’s position is inappropriate, the opposite of the second, so in its delight with the fourth, it looks up and desires to go. Having regretted its delay and hesitation in not going, it then regrets going—its fear is of the second six, its envy of the fourth nine. This is what is meant by \"emerging to see splendor and magnificence, unable to suppress the conflict in one’s breast.\"",
      "overlap_context": "umble and untried, yet in the end became the teachers of the world for ten thousand generations—this is the greatest and most manifest of the noble person’s completion.\n\nThe hexagram speaks of *humility* flourishing and again speaks of completion—how profound! The hexagram speaks of the noble person’s completion, yet the line alone speaks of the noble person’s completion bringing good fortune—how could there be no intent? For the third nine is the lord of the hexagram—the toiling and humble one.",

      "translated_text": "Alas! How few in the world possess the unyielding resolve of stone? Without such steadfast firmness as stone, one cannot consort with the nine in the fourth place—this much is clear from the *Yu* of *Great Possession*. For the nine in the fourth place is precisely that which is \"firm in response yet its will enacted,\" moving in accord and thus the very source of the hexagram’s *Yu*. Both *Yu* and *Return* encounter five yin lines, hence both take the image of companions. Xiong Guo said: \"Great Possession\" means one yang gains five yin. \"Companions gathered like hairpins\" means five yin unite with one yang. The six in the fifth place, yin and soft yet not upright, moreover rides atop the firmness of the nine in the fourth—it knows only ease and delight as joy, unaware that power has shifted downward and authority has entirely departed. Is this not the true and incurable malady of rulers, like the Later Lord of Liu? Death—it has long since come. That it has not yet perished is merely because the name and title barely remain, and the center has not yet turned inauspicious—yet this is no better than death. \"Center\" refers to the central position. But how many ministers like the Loyal Martial Marquis are there? Without the Loyal Martial Marquis arising from *Yu*, those who ride firmness ride the firmness of Wang Mang, ride the firmness of Sima Yi and his like—can they long avoid death? As for the six in the top place, it is submerged in *Yu* and never alters its course—why? *Yu* has already taken form and cannot be changed. If what has formed could still be altered, what blame would there be? But to change early and only then alter what has already formed—this is too late. For one should alter early, hence it is said: \"Submerged in *Yu* above—how can this last long?\" Tu Fang said: The *Tuan* statement and *Tuan* commentary of *Yu* extol the utmost beauty of attaining *Yu*, yet the six lines of *Yu* and their *Xiang* commentaries all speak of the calamities of indulging in *Yu*. Does this mean *Yu* can be attained but not enjoyed? Not so. The ruin of states and the downfall of families, ceaseless in their succession, all stem from *Yu*. Thus, if not submerged in *Yu*, one dies by *Yu*. Alas, *Yu*—to sigh in *Yu* until one’s will is exhausted is already inauspicious. Without the six in the second place’s unyielding resolve, \"not a full day,\" how could one preserve *Yu* to the end? This is precisely what it means to enjoy *Yu*—it is also the movement of compliance, the very source of attaining *Yu*. Is there any other way? Now, instead of reflecting on the source of attaining *Yu*, one merely enjoys the blessings of ease and delight—no wonder one is utterly lost in *Yu* and fortune turns to misfortune.\n\nLet us set aside these strange cases for now. Today’s scholars, clinging to the sage’s words that \"joy lies within,\" claim to know joy and forget sorrow, indulging their desires and wills, seeking only utmost pleasure. Is this truly the joy of the sage? How does this differ from sighing in *Yu* and ultimately perishing by *Yu*? The joy of the sage never departs from ardent effort. To speak of joy apart from ardent effort is to know nothing of joy. The sage’s forgetting of sorrow originates from the same place as forgetting hunger—if one is unwilling to forget hunger yet seeks only to forget sorrow, how can one not fail to forget both? Unaware of food, unaware of sorrow, unaware of old age, only lifelong ardent effort is known as joy—thus, one’s view of the world’s ease and delight is truly \"not a full day.\" Therefore, those who study the Dao must be unyielding as stone—not only in *Yu*. This is called the divine insight of \"knowing the incipient,\" the Way that penetrates above and below.\n\n**Appendix**\nQiu Xingke said: *Tun* has *Zhen* below and *Kun* above, hence it speaks of establishing lords but not of deploying armies. *Modesty* has *Kun* below and *Zhen* above, hence it speaks of deploying armies but not of establishing lords. *Yu* combines *Zhen* and *Kun* to form its body, hence it speaks of both. Su Zizhan said: The source of *Yu* lies in the fourth line, and the first harmonizes with it, hence it is called \"sighing.\" To rely on others for joy, trusting in one’s match for delight—loyalty is far indeed. Those who depend on others’ joy rejoice when others rejoice and grieve when others grieve, their will bound to dependence. When what they depend on is exhausted, they cannot but meet misfortune. Wang Ji said: Thunder rouses within the earth—this is the image of *Yu*, where the myriad things flourish and stretch. Of old, the former kings, following the harmony of heaven and earth, spread the qi of the eight winds, composed music to harmonize, and thereby aligned with the spirits and the people. From the heart it arose, through sound it moved, through posture it harmonized, through pitch it regulated, through tone it followed, and through instruments it was embodied. Thus, music is the flower of virtue, and composing music is to honor virtue. Hence, when music is complete, virtue is exalted. It is offered in the suburban and ancestral temples, sacrifices are made to heaven on the Circular Mound with the ancestor as counterpart—this is revering the revered. Sacrifices are made to the Thearch in the Bright Hall with the father as counterpart—this is honoring the honored. The Supreme Thearch is feasted, ancestors arrive, the myriad things are nurtured, and the world attains great harmony.\n\n**Hexagram 17: Following**\n*Following*: Supreme prosperity, beneficial to be upright, no blame.\n**Tuan**: *Following*: The firm comes and does not yield to the soft, moves and delights—this is *Following*. Supreme prosperity, uprightness without blame, and the world follows the times. The meaning of \"following the times\" is great indeed!\n**Xiang**: Thunder within the marsh—*Following*. The noble person, in response to dusk, enters to rest.\n**First Nine**: Office changes—uprightness is auspicious.

Sincerity on the path, with clarity—what blame is there?\n**Xiang**: \"In *Following*, there is capture\"—its meaning is inauspicious. \"Sincerity on the path\"—clarity brings success.\n**Nine in the Fifth**: Sincerity in excellence—auspicious.",

The *Second* also knows the *Third* to be a \"young one,\" unfit to bind to, and the *First* to be a \"great man,\" unfit to lose. Though no harm lies in holding both, how can the circumstances allow it? Thus, the *Six in the Second* would rather not lose this than bind its will to that. As for the *Third*, it now regards the *Nine in the Fourth* as a \"great man,\" and so would rather bind to the great man and lose the young one.\n\nAt the time of *Following*, the will is set on capture, striving to gain. If one does not follow with the four virtues of *yuan* (origination), *heng* (prosperity), *li* (benefit), and *zhen* (uprightness), not only will there be no gain, but there will also be blame—how can one follow then? The *Fifth* is in the central and upright position, of the same body as the *Fourth*. It naturally possesses the sincere joy of *Dui* (Lake). The *Fourth*, as a minister following the ruler, even if following results in capture, need not be spoken of. Though it may seem improper for a minister to \"capture\" while the ruler speaks, who knows that the *Fourth* is truly sincere with the *Fifth*? That it truly shares the same Dao? Moreover, the *Fourth* clearly knows that following the *Fifth* can bring success. Thus, the *Fifth* surely wishes it to follow. Even if there is capture, what inauspiciousness could there be? Observe the times, examine oneself, and simply follow—that is all.\n\nOnly the *Six at the Top* acts improperly, unable to sincerely delight the world and make others joyfully follow. Instead, it binds and restrains them, further securing them to compel compliance—how could this succeed? The king, using excellent rites to draw near the state, moves and brings joy to the people. Even the spirits of the Western Mountain may be employed in sacrifice—how could they be like ministers? Why bind and restrain them? King Wen’s lament runs deep. This hexagram is entirely set forth for this line.\n\nThe *First Nine*, \"going out to associate,\" immediately gains a companion of success, not waiting to lose one before gaining another—hence it is said, \"nothing is lost.\" As for the *Second* and *Third*, binding to the young one must lose the great man, and binding to the great man must lose the young one—how can both be held at once? Only joy suffices. Only the four virtues of *yuan*, *heng*, *li*, and *zhen* suffice. To follow without these is to invite blame—better not to follow.\n\nFang Shihua said: *Following* takes the meaning of \"following the times.\" Since the times have no fixed origin, the six lines have no fixed following—sometimes binding is possible, sometimes abandoning is possible—all follows the times.\n\n**Appendix**\nJiao Gan said: The Han Emperor Gaozu and Xiang Yu are its clear proof.\nZhou Yan said: The lines take \"following the times in movement,\" while the Great Image takes \"following the times in rest.\" Movement and rest do not violate the times—this is why the meaning of \"following the times\" is great.\n\n---\n**Mountain Wind Decay (Gu)**\n*Gu*: *Yuan heng*, beneficial to cross the great river. Three days before *jia*, three days after *jia*.\n**Xiang**: *Gu*—firm above and yielding below, *Xun* (Wind) yielding and *Gen* (Mountain) stopping. *Gu*: *yuan heng*, and the world is ordered. \"Beneficial to cross the great river\"—proceeding has purpose. \"Three days before *jia*, three days after *jia*\"—ending then beginning, the way of heaven.\n**Image**: Wind beneath the mountain—*Gu*. The noble one rouses the people and nurtures virtue.\n\n**First Six**: Correcting the father’s decay—having a son, the father incurs no blame. Dangerous in the end, auspicious.\n**Xiang**: \"Correcting the father’s decay\"—the intent is to succeed the father.\n\n**Nine in the Second**: Correcting the mother’s decay—cannot be upright.\n**Xiang**: \"Correcting the mother’s decay\"—attaining the central way.\n\n**Nine in the Third**: Correcting the father’s decay—slight regret, no great blame.\n**Xiang**: \"Correcting the father’s decay\"—in the end, no blame.\n\n**Six in the Fourth**: Indulging the father’s decay—proceeding brings remorse.\n**Xiang**: \"Indulging the father’s decay\"—proceeding gains nothing.\n\n**Six in the Fifth**: Correcting the father’s decay—using praise.\n**Xiang**: \"Correcting the father’s decay using praise\"—succeeding with virtue.\n\n**Top Nine**: Not serving kings and lords, holding one’s affairs in high esteem.\n**Xiang**: \"Not serving kings and lords\"—the will is worthy of emulation.\n\n**Mountain Wind Decay (Gu)**\n*Gu*: firm above, yielding below. Above and below do not communicate; below yields, above stops—neither above nor below acts. Alas, this is why decay is complete. Only when there is no communication does decay form—thus, one knows that its initial order must have been great communication. Hence, \"ending then beginning\"—is *yuan heng* not fitting? Only when there is no action does decay form—thus, one knows that its initial order must have involved action. Hence, \"ending then beginning\"—is crossing the river not beneficial? Therefore it is said: *Gu*: *yuan heng*, beneficial to cross the great river. Three days before *jia*, three days after *jia*. Three days before *jia*: *zi*, *xu*, *shen*. Three days after *jia*: *wu*, *chen*, *yin*. Since there is a \"before *jia*,\" there must naturally be an \"after *jia*.\"",

      "translated_text": "Having \"after *jia*,\" there naturally follows \"before *jia*\" once more. After reverting to before, ending reverts to beginning—such is the movement of Heaven. Thus, how could *yuan* ever decay? Should those who govern *gu* not act likewise?\n\nIf one does not rest complacent in *gu*, one will naturally understand its origins, and *gu* may be governed. There is no other technique, no other *jia*. Yet if there is no other Dao, then this is how the sage governs *gu*.\n\nNow, governing *gu* in the world is the same as governing *gu* in a single household. Thus, the six lines focus solely on the work of rectifying *gu*. Though what they rectify differs, none take \"being able to rectify\" as their task, nor \"willingness to rectify\" as virtue. One cannot be leisurely or indulgent in accomplishing the rectification of one’s parents’ *gu*.\n\nThus, to the point of endangering oneself in rectifying one’s father—though perilous, one ultimately attains good fortune. Even if rectifying one’s father leads to regret, the heart remains ultimately blameless. Thus, one who can rectify *gu* must be a filial son, without doubt.\n\nAlas! Ruler and parent are as one household; there is no division between state and family. One who can rectify the household can rectify the state; one who can rectify one’s father can rectify one’s ruler. Yet世人 often hasten to mend their household’s *gu* while treating their state as a mere lodging. This is because there are ministers who do not serve kings and lords, who may claim lofty ideals and refuse to engage with the world. But there are no sons who do not serve their parents—thus, they cannot but inherit their fathers’ legacy and rectify *gu*.\n\nThat one does not serve kings and lords may still be spoken of. Yet how many in the world truly do not serve kings and lords? Now that all are ministers to a single king and lord, can one still claim lofty ideals and refuse to take rectifying *gu* as one’s duty?\n\nThus, the sage speaks solely of the *gu* of parents to make it deeply personal and inescapable for all. The task is the work of rectifying *gu*—if one claims lofty ideals, one naturally does not act. Hence, it is said: \"loftily esteeming one’s task.\" The top line, *nine at the top*, is at the summit of the hexagram, hence \"lofty.\" It also draws from the height of *Gen* Mountain, hence \"loftily esteeming.\"\n\nThe duty of a child to a parent is something the heart cannot shirk; the duty of a minister to a ruler is something that cannot be evaded between Heaven and Earth. Yet to be named for \"loftily esteeming\" and not serving kings and lords is to be one who rebels against righteousness, disrupts constancy, and inverts the proper order. The sage merely takes what can be emulated.\n\nThose who covet such a reputation say: \"The aspiration may be imitated, but the words—can they be imitated?\" If the aspiration is truly imitable, then who will attend to the affairs of ruler and parent? Alas! A minister who does not serve his ruler has no ruler; a child who does not serve his parent has no parent—this is the path to great chaos. What does the sage take from this?\n\nFang Shihua said: The first line receives the yang below the father; the second line holds yin, representing the later mother. The third line again rides yang, representing the later father; the fourth line again rides yang, while the fifth line once more receives the yang above—thus, all share the image of the father.\n\nRectifying the mother’s *gu* cannot be done through steadfastness. To say it cannot be done through correctness is to grasp the mean in rectifying *gu*. The *nine in the second place* cannot be steadfast in its rectification of *gu*, for its approach differs from the first and third lines. As for *six in the fifth place*, it not only does not rectify its father through correctness but also employs praise to gently persuade him—this is the very Dao that leads to *gu*.\n\nThis is what is meant by \"receiving with virtue,\" what is called \"following the highest.\" The subtlety of imperceptible transformation—even the father may not realize it. This is what it means to be able to rectify *gu*, not to indulge it.\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Zizhan said: A vessel long unused breeds insects—this is called *gu*. A person long indulgent breeds illness—this is called *gu*. To take the world as having no affairs and refuse to act is to later be overwhelmed by affairs. This is why *gu* becomes a matter of concern. Vessels should be used constantly, the body should be labored constantly, and the world should always be engaged in affairs. The disaster of *gu* does not arise in a single day.\n\nHuman nature has no greater fear than hardship. Once the world is governed, to still make \"crossing the river\" one’s task is to dread its decay! Shi Baihuo said: The days follow the six *jia*, ending and beginning again like a ring without end—such is the movement of Heaven, the reason the workings of creation never decay.\n\nShao Guoxian said: To govern *gu* is called *gu*, just as to govern disorder is called disorder, to govern desolation is called desolation.\n\nZixia said: Facing affairs with dedication sharpens the will, thus avoiding blame—this is the meaning of \"having affairs.\"\n\nZheng Kangcheng said: A son altering his father’s way may begin perilously but end auspiciously, for though the act may not be smooth, the intent is.\n\n\"Indulging the father’s *gu*\"—proceeding brings no gain.\n\nCai Jiefu said: Why say \"there is no *gu* like *gu*\"?\n\nLiu Yongxiang said: \"Indulging the father’s *gu*\" is the inability to rectify *gu*. The lines take \"being able to rectify\" as their task, though what they rectify differs. Yet the emphasis on the mother’s \"cannot be steadfast\" and the father’s \"employing praise\" also has its Dao. Why? The affairs of parents must not be ignored. The minister’s duty to the ruler is likewise.",

      "translated_text": "Jiao Ruohou said: The fifth line of *Gu* all speak of \"rectifying the father’s *gu*.\" As for the top line, it states \"not serving kings and lords.\" At the end of the hexagram, speaking of one family, this refers to the days when parents are in their dotage, and one does not go out to take office. When Master Zeng resided in Lu, Qi sought to appoint him as a minister. Master Zeng said: \"Living with aged parents, I cannot bear to be far from my kin. To be made another’s servant—can this be my will?\" Wang Ji said: *Gen*’s firmness resides above, *Xun*’s softness below; the upper is haughty and cannot descend, while the lower is base and cannot ascend to meet it. Stopping yet yielding—this is how *gu* is formed. The noble person has a Dao for governing *gu*. The *gu* of the people’s hearts arises from idleness, decay, and neglect, leaving them unaware of how to rouse themselves. \"Rousing\" means to stir and inspire. Thus it is said: \"Renew the people.\" This is not merely about setting rules or issuing commands; it is about addressing the root. It is like a skilled physician treating illness: \"rousing\" is to expel external pathogens, while \"nurturing\" is to cultivate the original *qi*. Wind speaks of \"rousing,\" mountain speaks of \"nurturing.\" Zhou Yan said: \"Rousing the people\" is to awaken their base and yielding ailments. \"Nurturing virtue\" is to transform their careless stagnation. *The Yi’s* Upper Canon, Scroll Two, concludes here.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram 19: Lin (Approach)**\n\n*Lin*: Originating, prosperous, beneficial, and correct.

Joyful and compliant, firmness centered and responsive—great prosperity through correctness is the Dao of Heaven. As for the eighth month and misfortune, decline will not be long in coming.\n\n**The Image** says: Above the marsh is earth—*Lin*. The noble person, in teaching, thinks without limit and in nurturing, protects the people without bounds.\n\n**Line 1 (Nine in the first place):** Mutual approach—correct and auspicious.\n**The Image** says: Mutual approach—correct and auspicious, for the will is rightly enacted.\n\n**Line 2 (Nine in the second place):** Mutual approach—auspicious, with nothing unbeneficial.\n**The Image** says: Mutual approach—auspicious with nothing unbeneficial, for it does not yet follow commands.\n\n**Line 3 (Six in the third place):** Sweet approach—nothing beneficial. If one worries over it, there will be no blame.\n**The Image** says: Sweet approach—its position is not proper. If one worries over it, blame will not last.\n\n**Line 4 (Six in the fourth place):** Utmost approach—no blame.\n**The Image** says: Utmost approach—no blame, for its position is proper.\n\n**Line 5 (Six in the fifth place):** Knowing approach—fitting for the great lord, auspicious.\n**The Image** says: Fitting for the great lord—this means acting from the center.\n\n**Line 6 (Six at the top):** Sincere approach—auspicious, no blame.\n**The Image** says: The auspiciousness of sincere approach lies in the will’s inward focus.\n\n---\n\nThe hexagram *Earth over Marsh: Lin* depicts two yang lines approaching four yin lines. The four words—originating, prosperous, beneficial, and correct—solely praise the growth of the two yang. The six words \"as for the eighth month, there will be misfortune\" then consider the decline of the two yang. To praise their growth yet immediately fear their decline, to extol them without end yet follow with dread of misfortune—how earnest is the sage’s heart in upholding yang! Thus the hexagram’s words and the *Judgment* speak of *Lin* in this way.\n\n**Line 1 (Nine in the first place):** \"Mutual approach\" refers to approaching the fourth line. The first delights in the fourth’s compliance, approaching it through resonance. The fourth, being utmost in its approach to the marsh, and the first, as its minister, with one yang line approaching, does so only through the Dao of resonance and response. Thus it is called \"mutual approach.\" Though the first is yang, it approaches with correctness; though the fourth is yin, it responds with rectitude. Is it not fitting that \"mutual approach\" is correct and auspicious?\n\n**Line 2 (Nine in the second place):** Not only is it joyful and compliant, but it is also firm, centered, and responsive. Thus it is also called \"mutual approach,\" also \"auspicious,\" and further \"nothing unbeneficial.\" The one it responds to is the fifth line, the knowing approach of the great lord—how could it compare to the fourth line? Yet though it is said to be \"nothing unbeneficial,\" the *Judgment* reverses this and says it \"does not yet follow commands.\" Why? The fifth line, dwelling in the center of *Kun*’s compliance, only knows to listen and obey the second. Thus, for the second, it is \"nothing unbeneficial.\" The second, approaching with yang virtue, does not necessarily follow every command of the fifth. Thus, for the fifth, it is fitting for the great lord.",

      "translated_text": "Yet if the fifth merely receives in compliance while the second responds from the center, were it only a matter of following commands, they would not be two distinct matters. How could this bring great illumination to the fifth? The fifth also knows that the second’s centeredness cannot be momentarily abandoned, and to listen and obey exclusively with wisdom while occupying the honored position—this is no empty deference. Only thus can it enable the noble one to grow daily, which mere compliance cannot. This is what is meant by “Shun was of great wisdom.” Shun applied his centeredness to the people, and his wisdom thereby became great. If the fifth line enacts its centeredness toward the second, how could it not be fitting for the great lord?\n\nThe sixth line in the third place is neither centered nor correct, positioned at the mouth of *Dui*. It knows only a single flavor of sweet compliance. If it seeks compliance from above yet above does not comply, what use is its sweetness? Sweetness turns to worry, sweetness reverts to bitterness—this is the inevitable course of events. This is why its worry incurs no blame. Though it was originally said that sweetness has “nothing for which it is beneficial,” it is in fact because the two yang lines approach so closely to the sixth in the third place that it unknowingly generates anxiety. Above, it knows only *dun* approaching. From its position above the earth, seeing the fifth as the one who knows approach, the second also has this intention. Within, the second sees the fourth’s arrival as approach. The first also has this intention. Within the first, the two yang lines’ approach to this place becomes even more earnest—hence it is also called *dun lin*.\n\nThe *lin* hexagram’s “originating, penetrating, beneficial, and correct” do not derive from this; rather, this is called “great penetration through correctness, the Way of Heaven.” **Appendix:** Yang Jian says: “As for ‘in the eighth month there is misfortune,’ this refers to the month when the two yin lines grow.” *Lin* is the growth of two yang lines; *gu* is the growth of two yin lines. Every hexagram’s change spans seven, hence *Fu* says, “After seven days, it returns.” Now *Lin* speaks of the eighth month because, counting from the beginning of the first yang, *Fu*, *Lin*, *Tai*, *Dazhuang*, *Guai*, *Qian*, *Gou*, and *Dun* make eight. Yin is called “month,” yang “day.” Xiong Guo says: “‘Arriving at *lin*’ refers to the interchange of *Kun* and *Dui*, earth and marsh approaching one another.” *Dun*, according to the *Erya*, means “like an overturned *dun* vessel”; in the Jiangdong region, a high mound of earth is called *dun*. The upper line resides at the end of two earth lines, resembling a high place. *Dun* has seven meanings.\n\nWang Ji says: “Nothing approaches as earth approaches water, hence marsh above earth is *lin*.” Earth restrains water, which seems effortless. Yet if pressed by peril and constriction, it bursts forth in all directions, breaking only when exhausted. If treated with generosity, it gathers into a marsh. The noble one’s relation to the people is likewise. The people of the Three Dynasties never forgot the inexhaustible beneficence of the former kings’ teachings. Marsh is the image of storing things without limit; earth is the image of containing things.\n\n**Hexagram 20: Guan (Observation)**\n*Xun* below *Kun* above\n*Guan*: Washing hands but not yet presenting the offering—with sincerity, it is manifestly thus.\n\n**Judgment:**\nGreat observation is above. Compliant and yielding, centered and correct, it observes the world. *Guan*: washing hands but not yet presenting the offering—with sincerity, it is manifestly thus. Below, they observe and are transformed. Observing the divine Way of Heaven, the four seasons do not deviate. The sage establishes teaching through the divine Way, and the world submits.\n\n**Image:**\nWind moves over the earth—*Guan*. The former kings toured the provinces, observed the people, and established teaching.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Line 1 (Initial Six):** Childish observation. For the petty person, no blame; for the noble one, regret.\n**Image:** The initial six’s childish observation is the way of the petty person.\n\n**Line 2 (Six in the second place):** Peeping observation. Beneficial for a woman’s correctness.\n**Image:** Peeping observation for a woman’s correctness—this is also shameful.\n\n**Line 3 (Six in the third place):** Observing my life, advancing and retreating.\n**Image:** Observing my life, advancing and retreating—this does not lose the Way.\n\n**Line 4 (Six in the fourth place):** Observing the state’s splendor. Beneficial to be a guest of the king.\n**Image:** Observing the state’s splendor—esteeming the guest.\n\n**Line 5 (Nine in the fifth place):** Observing my life. The noble one incurs no blame.\n**Image:** Observing my life—observing the people.\n\n**Line 6 (Top Nine):** Observing their life. The noble one incurs no blame.\n**Image:** Observing their life—the aspiration is not yet at peace.\n\n**Hexagram 20: Wind over Earth, Observation**\nThis hexagram has four yin lines below, symbolizing ministers and the people—those who observe from below. Two yang lines above symbolize the noble one—those who observe the world. Only by having the means to observe the world can one become the world’s observation. Yet though the two yang lines above both constitute “great observation above” and both rest centered and correct with *Kun* bearing *Xun*, only the nine in the fifth place can observe with centered correctness. This is why it is named *Guan*.\n\nThe Master says: In observation, sound and scent are both absent—it is just like Heaven. What does Heaven say? Yet the four seasons proceed. The observer, considering himself divine, what teaching can be established? What transformation can be achieved? No teaching can be established, hence “establishing teaching through the divine Way”; no transformation can be achieved, hence “through the divine Way, the world submits.”\n\nNow observe the observer: just as he washes his hands before the guest arrives, before the offering is presented, those below observe and are transformed by the manifest sincerity, as if already solemnly facing a great guest. Thus the nine in the fifth place is truly the divine Way. To observe the nine in the fifth is truly to observe Heaven. Yet those below who observe the fifth do so as Heaven. What the fifth observes is the self. Those below who observe the fifth do so as the divine; what the fifth observes in the self is the people. My life, the people’s life—there is no distinction. This is called the world’s peace. The people, unknowing and unperceiving, and the fifth, without sound or scent, naturally communicate without words, and those below observe and are transformed.\n\nYet those who observe and those who are observed do not transform uniformly. Without uniformity, each follows their own depth and cannot be the same. Thus the six in the fourth place, as the ruler of *Xun*, draws near to the nine in the fifth and advances to observe the state’s splendor, becoming a beneficial guest of the king.",
      "overlap_context": "ch of the great lord—how could it compare to the fourth line? Yet though it is said to be \"nothing unbeneficial,\" the *Judgment* reverses this and says it \"does not yet follow commands.\" Why? The fifth line, dwelling in the center of *Kun*’s compliance, only knows to listen and obey the second. Thus, for the second, it is \"nothing unbeneficial.\" The second, approaching with yang virtue, does not necessarily follow every command of the fifth. Thus, for the fifth, it is fitting for the great lord.",

      "translated_text": "Herein lies the observation that effects transformation—is this not what is meant by \"those below observe and are transformed\"? The nine in the third place, too, can observe my life, yet it does not rashly advance to behold the state’s splendor, for the third has not lost the Dao. Those below it, however, know only to observe the fifth, gazing upon mere appearances without perceiving the truth, seeing only the small without grasping the great—how then could they comprehend the noble one’s freedom from blame? Though they may not yet speak of transformation, one cannot say their hearts do not submit to the fifth. Thus, only by combining the observations of the four yin lines can one recognize the nine in the fifth as the true spirit of the Dao, not easily fathomed or known.\n\nAs for the nine in the top place, its aspirations remain unsettled, and \"my life\" persists as a distinction—this is not the great observation of the Dao. Though it, too, is a noble one free from blame, it is far from the centered rectitude of the nine in the fifth. Therefore, only the six in the fourth place can serve as the master of transformation, and only the nine in the fifth can serve as the master of observation.\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Shi’s explanation: When the great vessel moves, the people follow; without words, things are understood—this is the Dao of observation. When the sage governs through the spirit of the Dao, rewards, ranks, punishments, and penalties exist yet are unused.\n\nXiong Guo’s note: Zheng Xuan said: The feudal lords present scholars to the Son of Heaven, and ministers present scholars to their lord, honoring them as guests with ritual. Only the host washes and offers drink to the guest, and the guest washes and toasts the host, while disciples arrange the offerings. Now, in the six lines of *Guan*, all lack the meaning of sacrifice, revealing only the text of observing the state and serving as the king’s guest.\n\nThe *Shuowen* states: The six in the second place, yin and yielding within, though corresponding with the fifth, is separated by the third and fourth—like a woman within the gate peering outward.\n\nWu Youqing said: The first line, yang in position, resembles a young boy. The second, yin in position, resembles a girl. The third refers to itself as \"I.\" The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is the daily generation of life. The six in the third place stands at the top of the lower trigram, near *Xun*. *Xun* signifies advance and retreat, so the six in the third observes \"my life\" to examine its learning, like the saying, \"I have not yet proven this.\"\n\nYang Jian said: Zixia excelled in discussing subtleties, and after Confucius’ death, believing a lord resembled the sage, he sought to serve him as he had served Confucius, pressuring Zengzi. Only Zengzi could not be swayed—only he could avoid the shame of reckless observation. It is also said: The six in the third place stands at the limit of the lower trigram, poised to ascend to the upper trigram—this is the moment of advance and retreat. With the six in the third’s symbol of advance and retreat, the six in the fourth advances to observe the state’s splendor.\n\nWang Jibai: Wind moves over the earth, touching all things—this is the image of comprehensive observation. The former kings, wishing to influence the world, established the institution of imperial tours. Whether conducting annual inspections or quinquennial assemblies, they harmonized seasons and months, standardized pitch pipes, measures, weights, and balances, commanded grand masters to present poetry to observe the people’s customs, and examined market prices to discern their likes and dislikes. Investigating local practices, they established teachings to instruct where differences arose: using ritual to distinguish extravagance (as in Cao) and exemplifying frugality (as in Wei), or demonstrating propriety to unify morality and harmonize customs.\n\n☰ below ☲ above\n*Shihe*: Smooth and prosperous.",

Hard and soft are divided; movement brings clarity. Thunder and lightning unite to manifest brilliance.

Favorable to persist through hardship—auspicious.\n*The Image* says: Favorable to persist through hardship—auspicious, yet its brilliance is not yet fully realized.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Biting through dried meat, one obtains yellow gold. Perseverance brings danger, yet no blame.\n*The Image* says: Perseverance brings danger yet no blame—this is due to proper attainment.\n\n**Top Nine:** Carrying shackles that cover the ears—misfortune.\n*The Image* says: Carrying shackles that cover the ears—hearing is no longer clear.\n\n**Fire below, Thunder above: *Shihe***\n\nCheng Zhengshu says: *Shi* means to bite; *he* means to close. With an object in the mouth, one must bite before closing. The hexagram’s upper and lower lines are both firm, while the center is yielding—this is the image of jaws. Moreover, a single firm line obstructs within, forming the image of an object in the jaws that cannot be closed without biting. Hence the name *Shihe*.\n\nYang Zhongli says: *Shihe* is the hexagram of removing obstructions. Legal judgments serve to investigate and seek the truth; when governance attains the truth, the world submits.\n\nLi Zisi says: Heaven and earth produce things, and whatever obstructs them must be struck and shattered by thunder and lightning. The sage governs the world, and whatever obstructs the people must be severed by legal judgments. Thus, *Shihe* removes the obstruction in the jaws, thunder and lightning remove obstructions among living things, and punishments remove obstructions in the world.\n\nZhu Zhonghui says: Biting through dried meat is harder than flesh yet easier than preserved meat. The lungs are yellow, the color of metal, and decisive in judgment.\n\nLiu Junbo says: *He* means to carry; *xiao* refers to wooden restraints. \"Covering the ears\" means the shackles rest upon the neck, obscuring the ears.\n\nXiong Guo says: In the *Rites of Zhou*, the *Laren* (preserved meat official), Zheng’s commentary states: Small creatures fully dried are called *teng*. *Teng* means \"evening\"—exposed in the morning and dried by evening. The *Marriage Rites* require fresh meat, hence the distinction.\n\nLiu Yongxiang says: The Fourth’s dried lungs are harder than preserved meat, yet its possession of the metal arrow’s talent aids in resolving the difficulty. Even in the initial stage of hardship, one must persist with caution to attain auspiciousness. Though auspiciousness is achieved, its brilliance remains incomplete. As Master Zeng said: \"When the truth is obtained, one should mourn and sympathize rather than rejoice.\" If there is no time even for mourning, how can there be brilliance? Thus, the Third’s encounter with poison leads to regret, and the Fifth must persevere through danger to avoid blame—what doubt remains?\n\nFang Shihua says: Every legal case arises from some obstruction causing dispute. If judgment fails to uncover the obstruction, the case cannot be easily resolved—like carving meat without first arranging the bones. *Shi* (biting) means to gnaw through the obstruction to resolve it. The bottom line symbolizes shackles covering the toes; the top line symbolizes shackles covering the ears. The Second, riding upon the firm, faces a difficult case—biting through flesh deeply enough to lose the nose means severing the bone, thus attaining the truth without blame. The Third, in an improper position, bites through preserved meat and encounters poison, incurring minor regret. Yet having personally bitten through it, there is still no blame. The Fourth, firm in virtue, bites through dried lungs and obtains a metal arrow (a tool for severing sinews). The Fifth, yielding yet central, bites through dried meat and obtains yellow gold—hence \"proper attainment.\" The Second, though riding upon the firm, is at the beginning, thus \"flesh.\" The Third corresponds to the Top Nine’s firmness, representing preserved meat of the whole bone. The Fourth is \"dried lungs,\" the Fifth \"dried meat\"—this is the distinction between the Nine and Six.\n\n**☲ below ☶ above**\n*Bi* (Adornment): Prosperous. Slightly favorable for advancing.\n\n*The Judgment* says: *Bi* is prosperous, for the yielding comes to adorn the firm—hence prosperity. The firm is divided and ascends to adorn the yielding, hence slightly favorable for advancing. This is the pattern of heaven. Cultivated brilliance at rest—this is the pattern of humanity. Observing the patterns of heaven, one examines the changes of the seasons; observing the patterns of humanity, one transforms and completes the world.\n\n*The Image* says: Fire beneath the mountain—*Bi*. The noble person thereby clarifies all affairs but does not dare to adjudicate legal cases.\n\n**First Nine:** Adorning the toes, one abandons the carriage and walks.\n*The Image* says: Abandoning the carriage and walking—righteously, one does not ride.\n\n**Six in the Second:** Adorning the beard.\n*The Image* says: Adorning the beard—this rises with the above.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** Adorned yet moistened, perseverance brings auspiciousness.\n*The Image* says: The auspiciousness of perseverance—none will ultimately overstep.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** Adorned yet radiant, a white horse soars. Not a bandit but a marriage alliance.\n*The Image* says: The Fourth, in its proper position yet suspicious. Not a bandit but a marriage alliance—ultimately without blame.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Adorning the hills and gardens, a bundle of silk—meager, yet ultimately auspicious.\n*The Image* says: The Fifth’s auspiciousness—there is joy.\n\n**Top Nine:** White adornment—no blame.\n*The Image* says: White adornment—no blame, for the above attains its aim.\n\n**Mountain below, Fire above: *Bi***\n\nOriginally, the lower was *Qian* (☰) and the upper *Kun* (☷).

      "translated_text": "Yet *Qian* is the firm thing—at its origin, it does not flow. Adorned with the brilliance of *Li*, it indeed flows; unadorned by the brilliance of *Li*, it also flows. For it follows the yielding in adornment, yet its flow does not depend on adornment—only because adornment also flows is it said: *Bi* flows.\n\nWhen the middle line of *Qian* is further divided and ascends to the top of *Kun*, the yielding transforms into the firmness of *Gen* Mountain, and the firm rises to adorn the yielding. Yet *Kun* is the yielding thing—it awaits *Qian* to advance, for it cannot go forth alone. If one were to adorn it solely with the firmness of *Gen* Mountain, then wherever it went would ultimately prove unprofitable. Thus it is also said: \"Slight profit in having somewhere to go.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"The intermingling of yin and yang, the blending of firm and yielding—these are the natural transformations of the *Qian* Dao, which is called the patterns of Heaven. Without the patterns of Heaven, how could the four seasons alternate and display their brilliance in the sky? Yet the inner trigram is *Li*, brilliant, while the outer is *Gen*, still—this is the image of brilliance coming to a halt, of stillness without adornment, which is called the patterns of humanity. Without the patterns of humanity, how could the world be transformed and all return to the primal adornment of white? The responsibility of primal color lies in white adornment. Thus, without observing the patterns of Heaven, one cannot know the spontaneity of transformation, which is not something human effort can achieve. Without observing the patterns of humanity, one cannot know that humans can surpass Heaven, that the sage can assist where Heaven falls short—and the achievement of *Gen*’s stillness is great indeed.\n\nTherefore, the first line is firm and occupies the lower second position. It would adorn its toes with brilliance, yet initially, it is contrary to principle—abandoning the carriage to go on foot. Though its edges may seem adorned, in truth it halts itself and cannot be adorned. Thus, the second line alone initiates adornment for the third. How could it know that the third, being firm in the upper position, would, like a beard moistened by proximity, remain steadfast in its firmness and eternal correctness? The second also halts itself and ultimately cannot add adornment.\n\nThe flow of *Bi* is to be observed in the first and third lines. As for the topmost line, it is truly white adornment. *Gen* is the mountain, also resembling the recluse of hills and gardens. Though the fifth line, the yielding ruler at the center, willingly receives adornment from the hills and gardens, and though its bundle of silk is meager—making it seem stingy and unadorned—there is still adornment present, so it does not yet qualify as white adornment. Why? The elder of the hills and gardens, the old man bearing his staff, what use has he for a bundle of silk? Yet if he does not exalt the topmost line, he too will ultimately find joy. Since the fifth has joy, the top attains its aim—what doubt remains?\n\nThe fourth, however, cannot escape doubt, for it occupies a position of pure yin. Yet it too is swiftly turning white. *Qian* is the horse, and it soars white. Not taking the above as a bandit but as a marriage alliance, it daily draws nearer to white adornment. Ultimately without blame—what doubt remains? Its profit in having somewhere to go is like this—is this not the firm rising to adorn the yielding?\n\nThus do I know that wherever yang firmness resides, the yielding truly profits from it and receives its adornment. To say that the yielding can adorn the firm—is there such a principle? Therefore, though the whole world follows the latecomers, the Master alone follows the rustic. Who could adorn him? Even after a thousand or a hundred years, adornment cannot be added—how much less in his own time? Alas.",

      "translated_text": "Lord Wang Ji states: Beneath the mountain there is fire, its brightness illuminating all things. Grasses and trees glow in mutual radiance—this is the image of *Bi* (Adornment). The noble person, observing this image of luminous illumination, brings clarity to all governance yet dares not rely on it to adjudicate legal cases. Cultivating governance is how civil patterns (*wen*) are perfected, but in the administration of justice, what matters is the truth of human feelings. If adornment is applied, the truth of those feelings is obscured; thus, one dares not use civil patterns to decide cases.\n\nSu Shi’s *General Explanations of the Hexagrams*:\n*Qian* transforms into *Li*, *Kun* into *Gen*—this is the configuration of yin and yang, the workings of number. \"Cultural brilliance restrained\" (*wen ming yi zhi*) is the virtue of *Li* and *Gen*. The dynamics of configuration and number unfold as Heaven bestows its virtue upon humanity.\n\nThe *Yijing* speaks of the mutual exchange of firm and yielding, of ascent and descent, but its most prominent expression is in the *Tuan* commentary on *Bi*. Hence, scholars have long debated the transformations that give rise to it, claiming that *Tai* transforms into *Bi*—a great confusion. A single hexagram may transform into sixty-three others; why should *Bi* alone be singled out? Scholars know only that *Tai* becomes *Bi*, but how do they know that *Bi* does not become *Tai*?\n\nAll the *Yijing*’s references to the mutual exchange of firm and yielding derive from *Qian* and *Kun*. *Qian* bestows one yang upon *Kun*, transforming one of its yin lines to produce the three sons, each with one yang and two yin. In all hexagrams of the three sons that speak of \"firmness coming,\" it is clear that these originally belonged to *Kun*, and *Qian* came to transform them. *Kun* bestows one yin upon *Qian*, transforming one of its yang lines to produce the three daughters, each with one yin and two yang. In all hexagrams of the three daughters that speak of \"yielding coming,\" it is clear that these originally belonged to *Qian*, and *Kun* came to transform them. Thus, all such references pertain to hexagrams where the three sons and three daughters meet. In hexagrams where this is not the case, such language does not appear.\n\nThe *Tuan* commentary on *Gu* states: \"The firm ascends while the yielding descends.\"\nThe *Tuan* on *Bi* states: \"The yielding comes to adorn the firm, dividing the firm above to adorn the yielding below.\"\nThe *Tuan* on *Xian* states: \"The yielding ascends while the firm descends.\"\nThe *Tuan* on *Heng* states: \"The firm ascends while the yielding descends.\"\nThe *Tuan* on *Sun* states: \"Diminishing below to augment above.\"\nThe *Tuan* on *Yi* states: \"Diminishing above to augment below.\"\nThese six are chosen as they arise in their particular contexts. Of the eighteen hexagrams where the three sons and three daughters meet, why are only these six singled out? The answer lies in the Sage’s multifaceted approach to selecting hexagrams: sometimes by image, sometimes by line, sometimes by transformation, and sometimes by the mutual exchange of firm and yielding.\n\nWhen selecting by image: *Heaven and Water moving in opposition* exemplifies *Song* (Conflict).\nWhen selecting by line: *The sixth three stepping on a tiger’s tail* exemplifies caution.\nWhen selecting by transformation: *Something in the jaws* exemplifies *Shi He* (Biting Through).\nWhen selecting by the mutual exchange of firm and yielding: *Bi* (Adornment) is the example.\nThe mutual exchange of firm and yielding is but one method among many for selecting hexagrams. When it is chosen, the text speaks of it; when it is not, the text remains silent. One should not be perplexed by this.\n\n---\n*Kun* below, *Gen* above: *Bo* (Splitting Apart). \"Unfavorable to have somewhere to go.\"\nThe *Tuan* states: *Bo* means splitting apart, the yielding transforming the firm. \"Unfavorable to have somewhere to go\"—the petty person grows strong. \"Following and halting\"—observing the image. The noble person values the waxing and waning of the full and the empty, the movement of Heaven.\n\nThe *Xiang* states: \"The mountain clings to the earth—*Bo*. The ruler above thickens the foundation below to secure the dwelling.\"\n**First Six:** \"Splitting apart the bed at the legs—disdaining constancy, misfortune.\"\nThe *Xiang* states: \"Splitting apart the bed at the legs—diminishing what is below.\"\n**Six in the Second:** \"Splitting apart the bed at the frame—disdaining constancy, misfortune.\"\nThe *Xiang* states: \"Splitting apart the bed at the frame—no one supports it.\"\n**Six in the Third:** \"Splitting apart—no blame.\"\nThe *Xiang* states: \"Splitting apart with no blame—losing connection to above and below.\"\n**Six in the Fourth:** \"Splitting apart the bed at the skin—misfortune.\"\nThe *Xiang* states: \"Splitting apart the bed at the skin—disaster is near.\"\n**Six in the Fifth:** \"A string of fish, favored by the palace women—ultimately without harm.\"\nThe *Xiang* states: \"Favored by the palace women—ultimately without blame.\"\n**Top Nine:** \"A great fruit uneaten. The noble person gains a carriage; the petty person strips the hut.\"\nThe *Xiang* states: \"The noble person gains a carriage—the people bear him. The petty person strips the hut—ultimately unusable.\"\n\n*Mountain and Earth Splitting Apart*:\nFang Shihua states: \"The yielding transforming the firm\" refers to the first through fifth lines. Formerly five yang, now five yin—this is *Bo* (splitting apart, decay). Yet one yang remains, destined to become the fruit of renewal. Thus, the Top Nine bears the image of \"a great fruit uneaten.\" Moreover, it is carried by the five yin, bearing the image of \"the noble person gains a carriage.\" As for \"the petty person strips the hut,\" it means that if the five yin reach this point without the Top Nine’s solitary yang above, they would be stripping their own shelter—what would cover them? Thus, the petty are deeply fortunate.\n\nYet when the petty grow strong, it is \"unfavorable to have somewhere to go.\" One should remain still and await the time, as night awaits day and winter awaits spring. It is not that winter and night are unnavigable, only to be fled. Where would one flee? Thus, from *Fu* (Return) to *Lin* (Approach), to *Tai* (Peace), to the brightness of *Da Zhuang* (Great Strength)—facing the light, one may proceed. From *Shi* (Beginning) to *Gu* (Decay), to *Pi* (Stagnation), to the darkness of *Bo* (Splitting Apart)—facing the dusk, one rests and does not proceed. This is the movement of Heaven. Thus, \"following and halting\" is how one observes the image of waxing and waning, the full and the empty—this is Heaven’s movement, in which the noble person does not interfere.\n\nThe First Six begins the transformation below, bearing the image of \"splitting apart the bed at the legs.\" Though it occupies the lowest position and remains humble, even as a yielding line, it may yet hold to constancy—how could misfortune be spoken of? Only when it disdains humility and scorns constancy, rushing toward misfortune, does this become evident. The Six in the Second is the same.",

Yet, abiding in the center and upholding correctness, it responds in harmony with the yang above. Though yielding, it remains steadfast—how could misfortune be spoken of? Only when it abandons centrality and correctness, scorning constancy to follow deviance, does misfortune first appear. Thus, these two lines—if they do not scorn constancy—will avoid great misfortune. Even in the time of *Bo* (Splitting Apart), occupying the second position after the first, the sage does not discard them.\n\nConsider the Six in the Third: though it loses the four yin lines above and below, it never dares lose the Nine in the Fifth, rightly responding to its steadfast correctness. In this way, though situated amid *Bo*, it naturally avoids blame—how could misfortune arise? From this, we know that the many yin await yang to find stability. If yang does not stabilize yin, it too is gravely imperiled. Yet if one clings to yang, though in *Bo*, what blame could there be?\n\nObserve further the Six in the Fifth: it leads the many yin to support the Nine in the Top, its image \"threading fish to court the palace’s favor.\" The sage rejoices in its initial lack of advantage yet trusts its ultimate outcome—no fault remains. Even if it transforms into yang, it still follows yang’s lead. Now, to emulate the Third and Fifth but instead follow the Six and Fourth is mistaken. Occupying a position close to the ruler, it courts imminent disaster—\"stripping the forest to the skin,\" willingly embracing harm—how foolish!\n\n**Appendix**\nCheng Zhengshu said: All yang lines have vanished; only the Nine in the Top remains.

The firm returns, moving in accordance with compliance—thus entrance and exit are supremely swift, and friends arrive without blame. Following the Way in reversal, the return comes in seven days—this is the course of heaven. Propitious for setting forth, for the firm is growing. In *Fu* (Return), do we not see the heart of heaven and earth?\n\n*The Xiàng* says: Thunder within the earth—*Fu* (Return). The former kings, on the solstice, closed the passes; merchants and travelers did not journey, and the lord did not inspect the regions.\n\n**First Nine:** Returning from not far, there is no great regret—supremely auspicious.\n*The Xiàng* says: Returning from not far is for the cultivation of the self.\n\n**Six in the Second:** A joyful return—auspicious.\n*The Xiàng* says: The auspiciousness of a joyful return is in following the humane.\n\n**Six in the Third:** Frequent return—danger, but no blame.\n*The Xiàng* says: The danger of frequent return is such that, in principle, there is no blame.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** Returning alone in the midst of the way.\n*The Xiàng* says: Returning alone in the midst of the way is to follow the Dao.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Sincere return—no regret.\n*The Xiàng* says: Sincere return with no regret is to examine oneself from the center.\n\n**Top Six:** Deluded return—misfortune. There is calamity in mobilizing troops; in the end, great defeat. For the lord of the state, misfortune—even after ten years, he will not be able to campaign.\n*The Xiàng* says: The misfortune of deluded return is to reverse the lord’s Way.\n\n**Earth above Thunder—Fu (Return):** The firm returns, and in returning, there is smoothness. How is *Fu* able to be smooth and free? Before return, there is restless coming and going, with illness and obstruction. Once returned, entrance and exit are supremely swift. Before return, even if friends follow your thoughts, blame cannot be avoided. After return, though the five yin’s friends arrive, what blame is there? Naturally, all take my cultivation of the self as their model, follow the humane as their standard, blame themselves for danger, set their sights on solitary return, examine themselves in sincere return—unceasing until the *Qian* does not turn back. How could one willingly accept the misfortune of deluded return? Moreover, deluded return is utterly inadmissible. Thus, the extreme misfortune of deluded return is emphasized to warn the First Nine. Only by returning from not far, with no great regret, is supreme auspiciousness attained. \"No great regret\" means that, having turned back and returned home, there is no regret for having gone east or west—thus it is supremely auspicious. In return, there is supreme auspiciousness; in delusion, there is calamity and misfortune—what doubt is there? Therefore, the second line, being near the first, rests and follows the humane, and the second line’s return is thus achieved. In return, there is auspiciousness. The third line, not centered, frequently returns and is in danger, yet ultimately returns. In return, there is no blame. The fourth line, dwelling in the midst of the five yin yet responding alone to the first, is solitary return. In solitary return, there is auspiciousness—this goes without saying. The fifth line, dwelling in the center of the upper trigram and able to examine itself, is sincere return. Sincere return is not only the fourth line’s return. The first yang’s return is like this; the second, third, fourth, and fifth yin’s return is like that. This is the momentum of the world turning toward the humane—what place is there for the five yin’s friends to arrive? If, in this way, one does not return, then there will be no return at all. Either the yin has reached its extreme and does not revert, or delusion is too deep to awaken. Thus, the top line twice speaks of misfortune, and also of calamity and great defeat. For if one does not return and is deluded, then good fortune turns to misfortune—there is no regard. Even with the First Nine’s humane influence, what can be done? Fang Shihua said: When the yin is heavy, it strips the yang. Suddenly, in a single day, the original heart is seen again, and the brightness of yang returns. Thus it is said: *Fu* (Return) is smooth and free—the firm returns. The yang’s Way is not externally imposed; returning is how one recovers the Way. From *Zhun* to *Meng*, to *Pi*, to *Guan*, to *Bo*, to *Kun*, to *Fu*—seven days. Once the first yang returns, the five yang naturally grow—propitious for setting forth. *Bo* has just exhausted the yang, and *Fu* immediately follows, thus the First Nine is \"returning from not far.\" The Six in the Second follows the First Nine’s humane influence. Humane is to center and lower oneself, desiring to return with it—is this not a joyful return?\n\n**Appendix**\nQiu Xingke said: \"The firm returns\" speaks of the single firm line of *Bo* reaching the top, turning back below, and becoming *Fu*. \"The firm grows\" speaks of the single firm line of *Fu* advancing from below upward, becoming *Lin*, becoming *Tai*, and ultimately becoming *Qian*. Because it has departed and then comes back, there is smoothness. Because it has returned and then gradually grows, it is propitious for setting forth. \"The firm returns\" speaks of the very beginning of return; \"the firm grows\" speaks of after return.\n\nJin Rubai said: Observing *Fu* allows one to know the humane. The humane is the heart of heaven and earth in generating things—profound and ceaseless. The *Tuàn* speaks of *Fu* revealing the heart of heaven and earth, and the six lines all concern the affairs of the humane. The First Nine, \"returning from not far,\" corresponds to Yanzi—this is the Way of *Qian*. The nine obtains the first line of *Qian*. The second, \"joyful return with friends,\" corresponds to Fuzi, Min Sun, and their followers. The third, \"frequent return,\" is like the sun and moon. The fourth, \"returning alone,\" refers to Mencius, born a hundred years later, who alone privately admired the Master to follow the Dao. The fifth, \"sincere return,\" is the Way of *Kun*. The Six in the Fifth is the central line of *Kun*—perhaps Zengzi corresponds to this. The top, \"deluded return,\" is self-abandonment and self-neglect—this is the unhumane.\n\nWu Ziyi said: *Fu* reveals the heart of heaven and earth—not that *Fu* itself is the heart of heaven and earth.\n\nYang Tingxiu said: Frequent return is not dangerous; frequent transgression is dangerous. \"Danger, but no blame\" means the sage warns of frequent transgression yet opens the way for frequent return.\n\nWang Benhe said: Frequent return is frequent loss. If there were no loss, how could there be return? Thus, the sage both worries over frequent return and rejoices in it.\n\nWang Fusi said: The fourth line, with two yin above and two yin below, occupies its proper position and responds to the first—alone attaining return, complying with the Dao in reversion. Thus it is said: \"Returning alone in the midst of the way.\"",
      "overlap_context": " petty man too will keep his hut.\n\nWang Benhe said: The Nine in the Top stands above, borne by five yin—this is \"the noble one gaining a chariot.\" If the Nine in the Top were to transform into pure *Kun*, heaven would collapse and earth overturn—what shelter would the five yin have? This would be \"the petty man stripping a hut.\"\n\nZhu Zhonghui said: The mountain clings to the earth. Only because the earth is thick can it secure its place.\n\n*Zhen* below *Kun* above: *Fu* (Return): Smooth and free.",

      "translated_text": "Cai Jiefu said: The fourth line, moving alone in the center to return, is like advancing amid the multitude of yin, turning back alone to follow yang—yielding yet attaining correctness.\n\nXue Juncai said: The auspiciousness of restful return lies in honoring humanity.

Movement and strength, firmness in the center with response—great penetration through correctness is the mandate of heaven. \"If not correct, there will be misfortune; no advantage in having somewhere to go.\" Where can one go in *Wuwang*? Heaven’s mandate does not protect—how can one act?\n\n**The Image** says: Thunder moves beneath heaven; all things partake of *Wuwang*. The former kings, in abundant response to the seasons, nurtured the myriad things.\n\n**First Nine:** *Wuwang*—going is auspicious.\n**The Image** says: Going in *Wuwang* attains the will.\n\n**Six in the Second:** Not plowing yet reaping, not weeding yet clearing—then advantageous to have somewhere to go.\n**The Image** says: \"Not plowing yet reaping\"—not yet enriched.\n\n**Six in the Third:** Disaster in *Wuwang*—someone ties an ox; a traveler gains it, the villagers suffer misfortune.\n**The Image** says: The traveler gains the ox; the villagers suffer misfortune.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Correctness is possible; no blame.\n**The Image** says: \"Correctness is possible; no blame\"—firmly possessing it.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** Illness in *Wuwang*—do not take medicine, and there will be joy.\n**The Image** says: Medicine in *Wuwang* must not be tried.\n\n**Top Nine:** *Wuwang*—acting brings misfortune; no advantage in having somewhere to go.\n**The Image** says: Acting in *Wuwang* brings the disaster of exhaustion.\n\n**Heaven and Thunder: Wuwang**\n*Wuwang* is primordial delusion. When truth is real and without delusion, then naturally there is primordial penetration, benefit, and correctness. Great penetration through correctness is the timing of heaven’s mandate. How could heaven’s mandate have delusion? Since heaven’s mandate is itself primordial delusion, the *Judgment* speaks of *Wuwang*, and the *Commentary* again speaks of heaven’s mandate. Heaven’s mandate is greatly penetrating and supremely correct. Those who call heaven’s mandate incorrect are deluded. Seeing specks in the eye, one perceives flowers in empty space. Without specks in the eye, how could there be flowers in empty space? How could heaven’s mandate ever be incorrect? Only because of specks does one see flowers in empty space; only because of delusion does one see heaven’s mandate as incorrect and disadvantageous to act. Not knowing to blame oneself but falsely claiming heaven’s mandate does not protect me—this is primordial delusion turning into outright delusion. How could any place one goes not be primordial delusion? Where could one go that is not the hidden arrangement of heaven’s mandate? If not for heaven’s mandate as primordial delusion, silently protecting and subtly assisting, one could not take a single step. Thus it is said: \"Heaven’s mandate does not protect—how can one act?\" Heaven’s protection is precisely the absence of deluded action. Alas, people are all deluded—thus they are protected yet do not know it.\n\nThe *Judgment* speaks of *Wuwang* as primordial, penetrating, beneficial, and correct—this is heaven, earth, and the myriad things sharing one primordial delusion. The *Image* speaks of thunder moving beneath heaven, all things partaking of *Wuwang*—this is heaven, earth, and the myriad things each having their own primordial delusion. Scholars may take this as proof that *Wuwang* is not delusion.\n\nThe first line, a single yang below, is thunder stirring at its inception—delusion is entirely dispelled. This is the moment when the solitary yang attains its will—where could one go that would not be auspicious? As for the second line, though thunder stirs below, delusion seems suddenly stilled. The sage still suspects its stinginess, thus reverses the phrasing to encourage it: \"If the second line can refrain from plowing yet reaping, not weeding yet clearing, then it will be advantageous to have somewhere to go.\" Yet its position is yielding, its nature yin—perhaps this is not yet certain. The Master, reading it, borrows the phrasing to rebuke it: \"The yin nature is stingy, constantly desiring wealth. Now the second line is not yet enriched—how could it refrain from 'not plowing yet reaping'?\" Alas! Considering the words of these two sages together, what then is expected of the second line?\n\nThe third line is three. One person ties an ox, one gains the ox, one loses the ox—there is gain and loss. Disaster is self-inflicted; though called *Wuwang*, what can be done? The fourth line, a *Qian* body dwelling below, is vast emptiness where nothing yet exists—thus it has not entered hesitation, has not been deluded by incorrectness, and can trust in the firm possession of heaven’s mandate, attaining correctness without blame. The fifth line, firm *Qian* centered and correct, should know what illness *Wuwang* could have. Trusting that medicine should not be tried, yet doubting due to the second line’s influence, it falsely suspects illness—this is delusion. The top line is precisely what is meant by \"not correct, there will be misfortune; no advantage in having somewhere to go.\" The body is within *Wuwang*, the heart transcends *Wuwang*—though it knows wealth cannot be attained, it does not know that exhaustion also brings disaster. Alas! How could one find someone like the first or fourth lines to discuss the meaning of *Wuwang* with?\n\nFang Shihua said: The firm comes from without and becomes master within—movement and strength, firmness in the center with response—this is great penetration through the correctness of heaven’s mandate. Great penetration through correctness—who commands this? The commander is heaven. How could heaven’s mandate have delusion? The first line, thunder’s master emerging from the earth with a single resounding crack, is the key to why the hexagram is called *Wuwang*. Its going is auspicious—how could it not attain its will? The second line, *Kun* yin governing wealth, *Kun* earth governing plowing, reaping, weeding, and clearing.",

Now, why is an ox suddenly tied, suddenly lost, and suddenly made for a traveler to obtain? This disaster arises from human action—how could it be called *wuwang*? The fourth line, a *Qian* body dwelling below, thus may hold to correctness without blame. Yet correctness is what all people inherently possess—it is not the fourth line’s correctness alone. The fifth line, centered and rightly positioned, is inherently *wuwang* and inherently aligned with correctness; yet by having a responsive relationship with the second line, it doubts itself as deluded—this is the illness of *wuwang*. If left untreated, it will heal on its own; if medicine is administered, the illness will worsen. Thus it is said: the remedy for *wuwang* must not be tested. To test it is to invite delusion, and the affliction of delusion will turn to disaster. The top line, excessively firm without centeredness, fails to recognize the *Qian* body’s inherent *wuwang*; driving it forward and forcing it in, it reaches the point of exhaustion—where is the benefit in going?

The sage’s response to things is like this: when they come, he illuminates them; when they depart, he does not retain them. This is no different from the illness of *wuwang*. Without rejecting external things, external things cannot burden him—why then resort to medicine?\"\n\n**Below *Qian*, above *Gen*: *Da Xu* (Great Accumulation).** **Auspicious to be correct.**\n**Not eating at home—good fortune.**\n**Auspicious to ford the great river.**\n\n**The *Tuan* says:** *Da Xu*: firmness, strength, sincerity, and brilliance—daily renewing its virtue. Firmness rises and esteems worthiness. It can restrain strength—this is great correctness. \"Not eating at home—good fortune\" means nurturing the worthy. \"Auspicious to ford the great river\" means responding to Heaven.\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** Heaven within the mountain—*Da Xu*.

Smoothness.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"What thoroughfare of Heaven!\"—the Dao greatly advances.\n\n**Mountain above Heaven: *Da Xu*.** *Gen* is firm and great. Nurturing the worthy is accumulation. What is meant by \"worthy\"? The three yang lines of *Qian*. *Qian* is firm, strong, sincere, and solid. The fourth and fifth lines are *Gen*. *Gen* shines brilliantly and daily renews its worthiness in this way. Thus, all are seen to be accumulated by the Top Nine, completing the greatness of what is accumulated. Yet the virtue of the Top Nine is truly sufficient to accumulate them. Its virtue is firmness rising and esteeming worthiness. Esteeming worthiness, the worthy are all willing to be accumulated by it. Occupying the superior position, it naturally has the power to accumulate them. With firmness, it can restrain strength, so it must nurture and perfect their worthiness before accumulating them—not hastily accumulating. Such is the great correctness of this line. Thus, all worthy of the time partake in the great feast. If even one person ate at home, it would be clear that the wilds had no unrecognized worthy. Together, they bear the thoroughfare of Heaven, respond to Heaven, and ford the great river—what doubt could there be?\n\nNow observe the First Nine, dwelling below, which could advance and be accumulated by the Top Nine. Yet it sees advancement as perilous and halts, avoiding the disaster of rash progress. Thus, the worthiness of the First is to be esteemed. The Nine in the Second has already harnessed its carriage, yet it sheds its shafts—this worthiness of the Second is to be esteemed, for its centeredness has no fault. The Nine in the Third originally aligns with the Top Nine’s will. Now, its carriage is harnessed, its fine horse gallops, and the three yang lines surge forward. Yet it still daily practices charioteering and defense, not forgetting the mind of hardship and correctness—this worthiness of the Third is to be esteemed. Naturally, it is \"beneficial to have somewhere to go.\" As for the Fourth and Fifth, below they ride the three yang lines, above they accumulate *Gen*’s firmness. This is called the \"young bull\" and the \"boar,\" while the single yang above resembles its castrated form and the restraint of its tusks. Thus, it preemptively restrains their strength and accumulates them to completion—supremely auspicious with joy, good fortune with celebration, which goes without saying.\n\nThe Third aligns in will. The Fourth has joy, and the Fifth has celebration—thus, the Top Nine’s path of accumulation reaches its great advancement. The way of all correctness opens the path for the many yang lines, clearing Heaven’s thoroughfare to smoothness. At this point, all flourish and aspire to be employed—who could surpass *Da Xu*? Yet observe the three yang lines: first, there is danger; then, the shedding of shafts; and the upholding of hardship and correctness. Observe the Fourth and Fifth: they are restrained by the castrated form and guarded by the tusks, preventing their strength from being hastily displayed or tested. Its accumulation is not taken lightly—such is the case. Truly, this is the time of *Da Xu*, akin to the era of Yao and Shun.\n\nSomeone asked: \"How do you know that 'brilliance daily renewing' refers specifically to *Gen*’s restraint?\" I replied: \"If it halted without advancing, how could it be 'daily renewing'? Thus, observing the Fourth and Fifth, one must restrain before advancing—this can be known.\"\n\n**Appendix.**",

Homophonous with *he* (賀), it signifies \"to bear\" or \"to carry.\" The *Fu on the Hall of Magnificent Light* states: \"Bearing Heaven’s thoroughfare, it attains primal flourishing.\" This demonstrates the interchangeability of ancient graphs. The *Zhou Book of Documents* commentary cites *Zhuangzi*’s \"bearing the azure sky without hindrance\" as further evidence. Xiang Ziqī said: \"Nothing halts like a mountain—nothing is greater than Heaven. Heaven resides within the mountain: this is the image of *Great Accumulation*.\"\n\nBelow *Zhen* (震), above *Gen* (艮): *Yi* (頤). \"Persistence brings good fortune. Observing nourishment, one seeks sustenance for oneself.\"\n\nThe *Tuan* says: \"*Yi*: persistence brings good fortune, for nourishing the correct brings good fortune. Observing nourishment is observing what one nurtures; seeking sustenance for oneself is observing how one nourishes oneself. Heaven and Earth nourish the myriad things; the sage nourishes the worthy and thereby the myriad people. How great is the timing of *Yi*!\"\n\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Thunder beneath the mountain: *Yi*. The noble person is thus cautious in speech and moderates eating and drinking.\"\n\n**First Nine:** \"Abandoning your numinous tortoise, you observe my chewing—misfortune.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Observing my chewing is likewise unworthy.\"\n\n**Six in the Second:** \"Overturning nourishment, defying the norm; seeking nourishment from the hill—advancing brings misfortune.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Advancing brings misfortune for Six in the Second, for one loses one’s kind.\"\n\n**Six in the Third:** \"Defying nourishment, persistence brings misfortune. For ten years, do not act—nothing is favorable.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"For ten years, do not act—such a path is greatly perverse.\"\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** \"Overturning nourishment—good fortune. The tiger’s gaze is fierce, its desires relentless—no blame.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Good fortune in overturning nourishment: bestowing radiance above.\"\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** \"Defying the norm, dwelling in persistence brings good fortune. One cannot ford the great river.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Good fortune in dwelling in persistence: compliance follows from above.\"\n\n**Top Nine:** \"Deriving nourishment—danger brings good fortune. Favorable to ford the great river.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Deriving nourishment—danger brings good fortune, for great felicity ensues.\"\n\n*Mountain-Thunder: Yi*\nWhy, in *Yi*, is it said that \"persistence brings good fortune\"? The so-called *yi* amounts to nothing more than seeking a single mouthful for oneself—what persistence or good fortune lies therein? Alas, *yi* is what nourishes others. To \"observe nourishment\" is to observe what one nurtures, not how one nourishes oneself. If one merely seeks sustenance for oneself, knowing only self-nourishment, what is there to observe? Thus, observing Heaven and Earth, one sees that what they nourish are the myriad things—Heaven and Earth do not nourish themselves. Observing the sage, one sees that what he nourishes are the worthy and thereby the myriad people—the sage does not nourish himself. How correct is this nourishing! Persistence therein brings good fortune. Hence it is said: \"How great is the timing of *Yi*!\"\n\nThe Top Nine nourishes the worthy. The Fifth, yielding and centered; the Fourth, yielding and correct—both rightly align with the worthy whom the Top Nine nourishes. Yet Six in the Fifth is the ruler. When the ruler ought to nourish others but is instead nourished by them, is this not contrary to the norm and defiant of principle? Though one may recognize the ruler’s inability to nourish and thus turn to the Top Nine for sustenance, one still cannot ford the great river. Yet dwelling in persistence brings good fortune, which must return to him—this is compliance following from above.\n\nThe Top Nine is the firmness of *Gen*; the First Nine is the firmness of *Zhen*. Both are yang firmness and thus both should nourish the worthy. Yet the firmness of *Zhen* lies below, desiring to nourish the worthy but unable to do so. If one remains envious of the Fourth’s nourishment above, then though one may daily embody yang firmness, how can one be deemed worthy? Beholding the Fourth’s nourishment from above, one is moved by observation—this is what is meant by \"abandoning the numinous tortoise to observe chewing,\" a base act indeed. *Duoyi* (朵颐) is the Fourth’s *yi*, an image of hanging downward.\n\nThe Second and the Fifth are proper correlates. If the Second seeks to respond to the Fifth’s hill, then the Fifth, awaiting nourishment from above, cannot but lose its kind and advance to misfortune. If it seeks to respond to the mountain’s summit above, this is not its proper correlate, defying the norm—how can one predict the outcome? As for Six in the Third, its proper correlate is above, and it should rightly receive nourishment from above. Yet it fails to recognize that the above nourishes the worthy and thereby the myriad people, instead harboring thoughts of defying nourishment and lofty aspirations—this is not impersistence. Yet why does it incur misfortune from losing its timing? Though it may remain unused for ten years, it merely withers in isolation, greatly perverse to the Way.",

Only Six in the Fourth, dwelling within the same *Gen* body, merits the straightforward declaration of \"fortune in inverting the nourishment\" as a stroke of luck. For when Nine at the Top radiates its light, who would not submit? As King Wen excelled in nurturing, even Boyi and Taigong came to join him—how much more so for those of the same body? Or those in proper correlation? When nourishment is thus, even a tiger’s devouring brings satisfaction; what fault could others find, that one would turn to defying nourishment to assert one’s own loftiness? Does one not know that the above is the very source of the hexagram, the root of nourishment wherein the nurturing of Heaven and Earth and the sages resides? To nourish all under Heaven is to bear its cares—how could one not take this as a warning? Yet those who would nourish all under Heaven must first nourish the worthy. How, then, could this not be called the profit of \"crossing the river by means of nourishment\"? The celebration of *Dayou* is surely what the sage desires to behold—yet if the time is not ripe, what can be done? Even if one possesses a spirit-turtle, if others fail to value it, one cannot but value oneself. Alas, on what day, at what hour, will people cease their restless pursuit and instead regard one as a mighty tiger?\n\n**Appendix**\nLiu Junbo says: Above *Gen*, below *Zhen*—outer firmness, inner softness—forms the image of a turtle.

      "translated_text": "Hexagram 59: *Daguo* (Great Exceeding), with *Xun* below and *Dui* above: The ridgepole sags. It is beneficial to have somewhere to go; there will be smooth progress.\n\n**The Image** says: *Daguo* means greatness in excess. The ridgepole sags—this is because the root and branches are weak. Though firmness exceeds, it remains centered; advancing with compliance and joy brings benefit to one’s journey, leading to smooth progress. How momentous is the time of *Daguo*!\n\n**The Image** says: The marsh submerges the wood—this is *Daguo*. The noble person stands alone without fear, encountering a world of deep gloom.\n\n- **First Six:** Using white couch grass as a mat incurs no blame.\n  **The Image** says: Using white couch grass as a mat—this is because softness lies below.\n\n- **Nine in the Second:** A withered poplar sprouts new shoots! An old man takes a young wife—nothing is advantageous.\n  **The Image** says: An old man with a young wife—excess in their union.\n\n- **Nine in the Third:** The ridgepole sags—misfortune.\n  **The Image** says: The misfortune of a sagging ridgepole—it cannot be supported.\n\n- **Nine in the Fourth:** The ridgepole is raised—good fortune. If there is another, there will be regret.\n  **The Image** says: The good fortune of a raised ridgepole—it does not sag beneath.\n\n- **Nine in the Fifth:** A withered poplar blooms; an old woman takes a young husband—no blame, no praise.\n  **The Image** says: A withered poplar blooms—how can this last? An old woman with a young husband—this is also shameful.\n\n- **Top Six:** Crossing the water, one is submerged past the crown—misfortune, yet no blame.\n  **The Image** says: The misfortune of crossing the water—it cannot be blamed.\n\nThe time of *Daguo* demands a foundation and branches both firm and strong, a body purely *Qian*-like in vigor, only then can there be great smooth progress without blame. Yet if it were purely *Qian*, it could not be called \"greatness in excess.\" It is only because the top and bottom lines are yin—soft and weak—that excess arises.\n\nWhat constitutes excess? A lord exceeding his ministers, a father exceeding his son, a husband exceeding his wife. If a lord exceeds his ministers, who will serve as his limbs? If a father exceeds his son, who will carry on his legacy? If a husband exceeds his wife, who will manage the inner domain? If yang exceeds yin, who will complete the cycle? This is precisely the time of *Daguo*—it cannot be delayed. One must swiftly go forth to seek firmness and uprightness, only then can there be smooth progress and the sagging ridgepole be avoided. Thus it is said: How momentous is the time of *Daguo*! This means that in such a time, one cannot follow the usual path; one must act with greatness beyond others—doing what others dare not. Like setting aside the Four Mountains to promote the obscure, or passing over the eminent to summon the humble from the cliffs of Fu Rock, the sages of old were largely like this. In this hexagram, only the Nine in the Fourth is sufficient to meet this moment. As Nine occupies the fourth place, firmness exceeds yet remains centered; with *Xun* containing *Dui*, it advances with compliance and joy. Thus it can benefit from having somewhere to go and achieve smooth progress, bringing the good fortune of a raised ridgepole.\n\nSuppose it were said: \"It responds to the First Six\"—this would be mistaken. The Nine in the Fourth, embodying compliance and joy, firmness and centered vigor, is not something the lowly First Six can sway. Now that it has achieved the good fortune of a raised ridgepole, there may be times when it relies on the First Six, using couch grass as a mat—what blame could there be? But if, having attained the smooth progress of a raised ridgepole, it merely waits for another’s response, it would be like trying to support the peak of a great hall with a single blade of grass—impossible. How could the Fourth incur such regret?\n\nThe Nine in the Third also possesses the timber of a ridgepole, but as Nine occupies the third place, firmness exceeds without centering. At the top of *Xun*, it knows only compliance and cannot advance with joy. Unable to go forth and achieve smooth progress, what can be said of the misfortune of a sagging ridgepole? When the ridgepole is raised in good fortune, even the white couch grass of the First Six—though not *Xun* wood—can be used without blame. But when the ridgepole sags in misfortune, even wood submerged past its crown, the toil of crossing the water, cannot support it to success. This is why the time of *Daguo* demands talent that is itself *Daguo*!\n\nThe Top Six is precisely the image of the marsh submerging the wood—submerged so deeply that the crown is not seen. At the extreme of *Dui*, the marsh waters run deep; crossing the water, one is submerged past the crown, and the wood is equally submerged—what misfortune! Yet the marsh can submerge the wood but cannot make the wood sink; when the waters recede, the wood emerges—what blame does the wood truly bear? Thus, the First Six’s weakness lies in its position below *Xun*, so its regret is with the wood, not the marsh. The Top Six’s weakness lies in its position above *Dui*, so its regret is with the marsh, not the wood.\n\nThe Second and Fifth also possess the timber of ridgepoles. Now, west of the Taihang Mountains, every household plants poplars—not only for their rapid growth but also for their straightness and strength, suitable for beams and ridgepoles. Yet if they wither past their time, they become useless. What is fortunate is that the withered may sprout new shoots. The reason they sprout new shoots is their connection below to the First Six, gaining a young wife. Though the First Six sees the Second as an old man, though past their time, their union allows the Second to sprout new shoots, becoming beams and ridgepoles—nothing is disadvantageous. Unlike the Fifth’s connection to the Top Six, where a young husband gains an old wife. Fleeting blossoms cannot last, nor do they sprout new shoots—what use are they? The Fifth’s end as a withered poplar is truly deluded.\n\nFang Shihua says: The ridgepole is likened to *Xun*, to wood. The four yang lines stand in parallel; the third and fourth, occupying the center, are like the ridgepole of a house. The withered poplar is wood past its time; the Second and Fourth share the same function, so the withered poplar sprouts new shoots, aiding the Fourth. The Third and Fifth differ in position, so the withered poplar only blooms, offering no support to the Third. The First Six originally symbolizes white couch grass, and with yin below yang, it also symbolizes the pairing of an old man with a young wife. The Top Six originally symbolizes submersion past the crown, and with yin above yang, it also symbolizes the pairing of an old woman with a young husband.\n\n**Appendix**",

The movement of the jaws causes them to hang down, revealing their activity.\n\nSu Shi explains: Above, stillness; below, movement—this is the image of nourishment. What all know yet find difficult to practice is to be cautious in speech and moderate in eating. Once words are spoken, they cannot be retracted; once food is consumed, it cannot be expelled.",

      "translated_text": "What is most regrettable is that all great worthies, in times of peace, do not treat the cultivation of learning as urgent, and when matters arise, they cling to the norms of reputation to sustain themselves. Once they have entered peril, only then do they seek a way out—by then, it is too late.\n\nThus, it is shown: The noble person does not detest peril but detests entering peril of his own accord. If one does not enter peril, what peril can assail him? Now, if one enters peril due to one’s own missteps, then one is already within peril—how can one hastily emerge? Therefore, the noble person does not rejoice in his ability to emerge from peril but rather rejoices in his ability to cautiously enter peril. Why? Because when faced with such unavoidable circumstances, there must first be a situation that can be managed, and only then can one calmly plan. This is like King Wen’s imprisonment in Youli.\n\nThus, once one has entered peril, one must settle into it without haste, without rushing to escape. One should treat peril as a pillow and delve into the depths of its abyss—this is the foremost principle in handling peril. It is not that one does not desire to emerge, but at such a time, to seek escape would ultimately be futile. If one pursues minor gains without realizing that the layered perils cannot be swiftly overcome, then one may fear that the abyss will become perilous, and in the end, one may never emerge again.\n\nOnly the sixth line of the third position truly grasps the Dao of dwelling in peril, and King Wen again raises it as a warning—its meaning is profound. The initial line represents one who enters the abyss of his own accord. Once one has entered the abyss, one is already enriched—who can one blame? This is like Chen Shu and Ouyang Xun. The top line represents one who has fortunately emerged from peril, yet is still bound by restraints, placed among thorns, and remains subject to three years of misfortune—can this be allowed to continue? This is like Li Gu and Chen Fan. These are all figures the world calls great worthies, yet in the end, they could not protect themselves, brought calamity to the state, and still prided themselves on their reputations for integrity—how tragic!\n\nAs for the *zun* wine and the *fu* vessel, this is like Shuzi of Wei. Before the abyss is filled, it is like Duke Cheng of Wei. The second line of the nine seeks only minor gains, so it has not yet emerged from the center. Now, the fifth line of the nine faces peril ahead, meaning the abyss is not yet full. If one points to the day of emerging from the abyss, it is as if the abyss has already been leveled. Though still within the abyss, the center is not greatly flawed. The second line of the nine seeks the companionship of minor gains, which is why it can emerge together with the fourth, ultimately without blame.\n\nThe *Commentary* states: Water flows without filling, traverses peril without losing its sincerity—this is the image of possessing sincerity. The second and fifth lines are centered and firm, with only the heart being free—this is the image. One abyss follows another, two abysses layered together, advancing without end—this is the image of esteemed action and meritorious achievement. Thus, the abyss truly bestows merit and power upon people, and its great utility in due time is evident. Therefore, the *Judgment* and *Commentary* uniquely emphasize the peril of the abyss, inverting it to esteem the abyss—this is fitting.\n\n*\"Pillow\"* refers to resting upon the second line.\n\n**Appendix**\nJin Rubai said: Among the eight trigrams, only *Kan* is the hexagram of hardship and adversity. Confucius once remarked: *\"Was the author of the Changes not one who knew hardship?\"* Thus, he arranged the nine hexagrams to clarify the Dao of handling them. Both yang lines are firm and centered, yet the second is not equal to the fifth. The fifth is centered, upright, and about to emerge from peril.\n\nXiong Nansha said: *\"Fu\"* (enriched), according to Wang Su, refers to the bottom of the abyss, beneath the *Repeating Peril*. The *Shuowen* states: *\"Within the abyss, there is yet another abyss.\"* *Repeating Peril* refers to the combination of the inner and outer trigrams. *\"Entering the abyss\"* refers to the inner trigram’s interior, meaning arrival. *\"Coming and going\"* refers to the abyss within the abyss. The lower abyss has just been escaped, while the upper abyss lies ahead.\n\n*\"Wine\"* is the dark water of the abyss. *\"Fu\"* (vessel), according to the *Erya*, is a type of jar. Sun Yan said: The earthenware vessel is also an image of *Li* (fire), like a drum or jar, which can accompany singing, hence the *Book of Songs* says: *\"Kan! They strike the jars.\"*\n\nThe fourth line is even and empty, allowing light to pass through—this is the image of a window. The fourth and fifth lines intertwine, not through the door but through the window, as they are not in proper correspondence. Among the six children, the lines of the doubled hexagrams do not correspond; their meaning lies in close proximity alone. The fourth line of *Kan* is yielding, closely aligned with the fifth’s firmness—hence it is said: *\"Firm and yielding meet.\"*\n\n*\"Zhi\"* (only), according to Zheng, is written as *\"zhi\"* (paper). According to the *Book of Songs*: *\"Wan is in the water like paper.\"* The *Shuowen* states: *\"A small islet, not yet fully formed.\"* This explains *\"the abyss is not full\"* in three instances.\n\n*\"Hui\"* refers to the thighs; *\"jin\"* refers to both thighs. *Kan* represents thorns. *\"Placed among thorns\"* means deliberating under the nine thorns. The *Nine Schools of the Changes* states: *\"Those who harm others are subjected to severe punishment.\"* For those who can reform, the gravest offense is punished with three years of confinement, followed by three years of probation. Those who cannot reform and leave the prison grounds are executed—hence the misfortune.\n\nSu Shi explained: *\"Zun* wine and *fu* vessel\"* are meager offerings. *\"Entering through the window\"* is the height of simplicity. Those who share interests become close without formal bonds; those who share hardships trust without prior agreement. The fourth line is not the fifth’s master, nor is the fifth the fourth’s shield. Though they exchange meager gifts and act with simplicity, they ultimately do not blame each other—this is the relationship between the fourth and fifth lines.\n\nLi Zisi said: The top line rides below five firm lines, foreshadowing the calamity of being bound and placed among thorns—like a man trapped in prison, hands entangled in ropes, feet treading upon thorns.\n\nSima Junshi said: Water flows continuously, accumulating to form great rivers. A person’s learning, when practiced without cease, leads to great worthiness. Thus, the noble person constantly cultivates virtue and practices teaching.\n\n---\n**Hexagram 30: Li (Clinging)**\n*Li*: Favorable for constancy, offering.

Stillness and joy, the man submits to the woman—thus there is smooth progress, benefit in constancy, and good fortune in taking a wife.\nHeaven and Earth respond, and the myriad things transform and arise; the sage responds to the human heart, and the world attains peace. Observe their responsiveness, and the nature of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things becomes visible.\n\n**The Image (象):**\nAbove the mountain is the marsh: the image of *Xian*. The noble person empties himself to receive others.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Six:** Responds with the big toe.\n**The Image:** Responds with the big toe—his aspiration lies outward.\n\n**Six in the Second:** Responds with the calf. Misfortune. Dwelling brings good fortune.\n**The Image:** Though misfortune, dwelling brings good fortune—submission avoids harm.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** Responds with the thigh, clinging to what follows. Going leads to regret.\n**The Image:** Responds with the thigh—he does not remain still. His aspiration is to follow others; what he clings to is lowly.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Constancy brings good fortune; regret vanishes. Coming and going in agitation, friends follow your thoughts.\n**The Image:** Constancy brings good fortune; regret vanishes—no harm from responsiveness. Coming and going in agitation—its brilliance is not yet great.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** Responds with the flesh of the upper arm. Supreme regret.\n**The Image:** Responds with the flesh of the upper arm—his aspiration is not yet realized.\n\n**Top Six:** Responds with the jaws, cheeks, and tongue.\n**The Image:** Responds with the jaws, cheeks, and tongue—flattery flows from the mouth.\n\n**Marsh above Mountain: Xian**\nThe Way of the world lies in responsiveness alone. The initial line, at the bottom of the inner trigram, aspires to the fourth line of the outer trigram—when there is response, the big toe moves. Above the toe is the calf, and above the calf is the thigh; when the toe moves, the calf and thigh follow. Thus, the initial line responds and moves, the second line follows its movement, and the third line follows as well. The second line corresponds to the position of the calf, and the third to the position of the thigh. Above the thigh lies the heart, and the fourth line occupies the heart’s position—though the heart is unseen, it appears unmoved. Yet constancy may bring good fortune and dispel regret. Responsiveness is the constant principle of the world, and regret or harm often lies within it. The noble person, moved by response, considers regret but never abandons responsiveness because of it.\n\nNow, if the initial line responds to the fourth, yet the fourth seems unresponsive, why is this? Before response, there is no movement; without movement, there is the good fortune of steadfast constancy. Without response, there is no harm; without harm, supreme regret may vanish—is this not excellent? Yet the line anxiously probes your thoughts, and *The Image* further judges it as \"not yet great\"—this is because unresponsiveness is unnatural. The heart must be disturbed by coming and going; how can it not be bright and upright? Such is the mockery it invites.\n\nAbove the heart lies the diaphragm, and the fifth line occupies the position of the upper arm’s flesh. When there is response, the upper arm moves, though its movement is not readily visible. Above the upper arm lies the jaw, and the top line occupies the jaw’s position. Thus, observing the jaw’s movement reveals the fifth line’s aspiration toward the top. Otherwise, why would the top line expend such flattery? Alas! Responsiveness is the true principle—what need is there for words? Responsiveness is the true heart—how can it remain unmoved? Heaven and Earth are thus, and the myriad things are thus; otherwise, all movement in the world would nearly cease.\n\nThe initial line’s movement of the toe is responsiveness. The second line’s movement of the calf is not responsiveness but following—it moves in tandem with the initial line, which King Wen found blameworthy. Confucius said: Though the second line seems to follow the initial line’s movement, how can one be certain it does not respond to a response? Following the initial line leads to misfortune, so dwelling brings good fortune. If there is true responsiveness, then submission avoids harm.\n\nOnly the third line truly follows the initial line’s movement, hence it is said, \"he does not remain still.\" When others move, he moves—not because of a prior response. To respond and not move is wrong; this is the principle. Movement from response is free of calculation, while movement from following is mere servitude. Thus it is said, \"what he clings to is lowly\"—like a servant obeying commands, not the conduct of a true person. Alas! If following is not responsiveness, then the world’s responsiveness is abandoned. Movement not arising from oneself—how can this be the true nature of responsive movement? Thus the sage values responsiveness over following, for response arises from oneself, while following is initiated by others. The distinction between self and other—can the scholar fail to examine this?\n\nIf there is response without reciprocation, then the world’s responsiveness is hollow. Spiritual response and spiritual reciprocation are the utmost in natural swiftness. Thus the sage speaks of response but not reciprocation, for response here is reciprocation there—they are one mechanism. Can the scholar fail to examine this? Only when response and reciprocation are one mechanism do they occur simultaneously—what need is there for anxious thoughts to deceive others?\n\nThe Old Bald One says: Above is *Dui* (☱), below is *Gen* (☶)—the yielding is above, the firm below. Mountain and marsh share *qi*, and the two *qi* respond and interact. Stillness and joy—this is the constancy of virtue. The man submits to the woman—this is the correctness of ritual. The Way of responsiveness is complete.\n\nHe also says: Response lies in the heart, and reciprocation also lies in the heart. When the heart responds, below it moves the feet, and above it moves the mouth.",

      "translated_text": "When first there is a stirring in the heart, the toes move—yet if the center of the four (the heart) does not respond, this is no true emotion. Thus the sage cuts off all anxious thoughts. The fifth line resides above the heart, its symbol being *hui* (悔, regret); when the fifth is stirred, it moves the spleen, yet the spleen, like the heart, cannot be seen. If the spleen moves, the mouth must respond—thus the primal *hui* (元悔, primal regret) becomes visible only when the cheeks assist. For when the spleen is stirred, the cheeks must respond; when the spleen moves, the mouth’s speech must follow the knees. Though *hui* and *yuanhui* may not yet be known, how can the truth of response and reciprocation be concealed?\n\nThe essential teaching of the *Xian* hexagram (☶☱) is drawn from the human body. Not only does response reside in the heart, but the upper line corresponds to the mouth of *Dui* (☱), while the lower line corresponds to the fingers of *Gen* (☶). When the heart is stirred, the toes move at once—even though this occurs in the line of *Gen* (☶), which signifies stillness, one cannot force them to stop. To insist on their immobility is nothing but deceit.\n\nAlas! Who knows that the transformation and generation of the myriad things, the peace of all under heaven, are all brought about by this response and reciprocation? Heaven and earth, even the sages, cannot stand apart from it—yet man seeks to adorn his emotions to deceive others. Thus I return once more to the *Xian* hexagram’s principle of response, and so I reiterate it.",

      "translated_text": "Alas! This is the foremost principle of inquiry and learning. Why so? To deceive oneself fundamentally is to render one’s intent sincere. When intent is sincere, the heart naturally attains correctness without effort, and the body naturally attains cultivation without contrivance—how then could family, state, and all under heaven fail to be ordered, governed, and pacified?\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Changgong says: The male submits to the female, submitting only to obtain—this is necessarily the upright. To take and obtain uprightness is the advantage of the taker. Passion is its truthfulness. The thundercloud follows the dragon, the wind follows the tiger—without cause, how could they follow one another? How could there be falsity?\n\nZhu Zhonghui says: *Xian* (咸) means response. When *Gen* (艮) halts, the response is concentrated in *Dui* (兑); when *Dui* delights, the response is complete. Moreover, *Gen* as the youngest son submits to *Dui* as the youngest daughter, the male preceding the female, thus attaining the correctness of male and female.\n\nYang Jian says: Having responded to one another in delight, why then speak of halting? Is halting not also delight? Delight divided becomes two; halting and delight united become one. Like the myriad images in still water, the water remains constant while the images move of themselves. Like heaven and earth responding to one another, they are never not serene. Great indeed is the Dao of halting and delight!\n\nMu Bolai says: *Xian* means response. Without response, how could there be *Xian*? The Dao of response is not only so for male and female. The Dao of heaven and earth acts above and moves below, and the myriad things flourish, transform, and come to life. The heart of the sage is sincere in this and moves in that, and all under heaven responds grandly, harmonious and at peace. Thus, observing their response, the nature of heaven, earth, and the myriad things becomes visible. Passion is the true mechanism of heaven, earth, and the myriad things. Without response, how could it be perceived?\n\n**Excerpts from *Xiangzhi* (象指), by Hu Shenyu**\nThe *Upper Canon* begins with *Qian* (乾) and *Kun* (坤) because heaven and earth are established in their positions. The *Lower Canon* begins with *Xian* (咸) and *Heng* (恒) because mountain and marsh communicate in qi. Position requires distinction, so heaven and earth are divided into two hexagrams. Qi requires union, so mountain and marsh are combined into one hexagram. In the eight pure hexagrams, none of the lines respond, but in *Tai* (泰) and *Pi* (否), heaven and earth respond; in *Jian* (成) and *Sun* (损), the youngest son and daughter respond; in *Heng* (恒) and *Yi* (益), the eldest son and daughter respond. In *Xian*, the youngest son submits to the youngest daughter, making it the most complete response—thus it heads the *Lower Canon*. It is also said: The *Shuowen* states, “The spleen is the backbone; the heart is connected to the backbone to stabilize spirit and govern the myriad affairs.” Hence the *Book of Songs* says, “The backbone’s strength manages affairs.” Wang Bi took it as the heart above and the mouth below, while Minister Lu identified it as the throat’s uvula. Feng He said it is the throat’s passage for intake and release.\n\nWang Ji says: Mountain and marsh communicate in qi, the mountain’s emptiness paired with the marsh’s moisture. Only emptiness enables communication; fullness obstructs it. Thus it is said: “They are hollowed in mountains and rivers.” The noble person, observing the image of mountain and marsh communicating in qi, empties the center to receive others. Emptiness is the source of the Dao. The eye is only empty, thus it can receive all colors under heaven. The ear is only empty, thus it can receive all sounds under heaven. The heart is only empty, thus it can receive all goodness under heaven. If the eye retains blue and yellow, its clarity is dazzled and cannot distinguish colors. If the ear retains purity and turbidity, its hearing is impaired and cannot discern sounds. If the heart retains essential principles, it becomes obstructed and cannot adapt to change. The noble person’s learning establishes the root through attaining emptiness. *Xian* is the response of the original heart. “Emptiness within, without self” is called uprightness; uprightness brings good fortune and eliminates regret. The response of the original heart—what is meant by “no thought, no worry”? “No thought, no worry” is not the absence of thought and worry. The heart moves directly, arising naturally. Though one thinks and worries all day, there is never any actual thought or worry. Thus it is said: “All under heaven converge in one destination by different paths, unite in one principle through a hundred considerations.” Scholars of the world cling to paths without knowing their destination, drown in considerations without knowing their principle—this is the response of restless agitation, not the natural Dao.\n\n☴☳ *Heng*: Persistence. Smooth progress, no blame, beneficial for uprightness, beneficial for having somewhere to go.\n**The *Tuan* says:** *Heng*? Endurance. The firm ascends and the yielding descends; thunder and wind unite, yielding and moving, firm and yielding all responding—this is *Heng*. “Smooth progress, no blame, beneficial for uprightness”—enduring in one’s Dao. The Dao of heaven and earth endures without ceasing. “Beneficial for having somewhere to go”—ending then beginning anew. The sun and moon attain heaven and thus can shine long; the four seasons transform and thus can endure in their completion. The sage endures in the Dao, and all under heaven is transformed and completed. Observing their endurance, the nature of heaven, earth, and the myriad things becomes visible.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Thunder and wind: *Heng*. The noble person stands firm and does not change his principles.\n**First Six:** Dredging persistence—uprightness brings misfortune; no benefit in anything.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The misfortune of dredging persistence lies in seeking depth from the outset.\n**Nine Two:** Regret vanishes.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Nine Two’s regret vanishes because it can endure in the center.\n**Nine Three:** Not persistent in virtue—someone may bring shame upon it; uprightness brings remorse.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Not persistent in virtue—there is no place for it.\n**Nine Four:** Hunting in the field yields no game.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Enduring where it is not one’s position—how can one obtain game?\n**Six Five:** Persistent in virtue—uprightness. For a woman, good fortune; for a man, misfortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** A woman’s uprightness brings good fortune because she follows one to the end. A man’s judgment of righteousness—following a woman brings misfortune.\n**Top Six:** Shaking persistence—misfortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Shaking persistence in the highest position achieves nothing great.\n\n**Thunder and Wind: *Heng***\nFang Shihua says: *Zhi* (值) means duration. Since it is called duration, persistence lies within me—naturally, there is no need for forced seeking. The first line corresponds to the beginning of *Xun*’s (☴) entry—now is when one begins to seek. Without seeking, seeking itself is unbeneficial.",
      "overlap_context": " *Gen* (☶), which signifies stillness, one cannot force them to stop. To insist on their immobility is nothing but deceit.\n\nAlas! Who knows that the transformation and generation of the myriad things, the peace of all under heaven, are all brought about by this response and reciprocation? Heaven and earth, even the sages, cannot stand apart from it—yet man seeks to adorn his emotions to deceive others. Thus I return once more to the *Xian* hexagram’s principle of response, and so I reiterate it.",

      "translated_text": "**On *Heng*:**\n*Heng* means persistence. Since it is called *heng*, persistence resides within—naturally, its depth is not perceived. The first line corresponds to the moment of *Xun*’s (☴) entry, when one begins to seek deeper penetration. Without depth, depth itself invites misfortune. Only the second line, *Nine Two*, avoids this. Dwelling in the center, it is fundamentally deep; firm yet without forced seeking, thus its regret vanishes. *Nine Three* is overly firm and not centered; moreover, *Xun* inclines toward advancement, leading ultimately to restlessness. The third line of the hexagram resides in *Xun*—its lack of constancy in virtue is evident. If one still feels shame at this, it may yet be remedied; but the restless, self-satisfied person, should others defer to their disgrace, would find no place among companions or peers.\n\n*Nine Four* dwells at the base of the upper trigram, neither centered nor correct, its *Zhen* (☳) movement already excessive.

      "translated_text": "The *Xiang* says: The peril of being bound in retreat stems from exhaustion and weariness. That keeping servants and concubines brings good fortune means no great undertakings are possible.\n\n*Nine Four*: A fondness for retreat—good fortune for the noble person, misfortune for the petty person.\nThe *Xiang* says: The noble person’s fondness for retreat means the petty person fares ill.\n\n*Nine Five*: An admirable retreat—constancy brings good fortune.\nThe *Xiang* says: An admirable retreat with constancy brings good fortune, for the will is rightly aligned.\n\n*Top Nine*: A rich retreat—nothing is not favorable.\nThe *Xiang* says: A rich retreat—nothing is not favorable, for there is no cause for doubt.\n\nThe hexagram *Tian Shan Dun* (Retreat) represents a time when the two yin lines gradually lengthen while the four yang lines withdraw their *qi*. Because this is a time of withdrawing *qi*, it is called \"return\"; because one can act in accord with the times, it is said that \"retreat is *heng* (smooth/flourishing).\" In this hexagram, *Nine Five* holds its proper position, while *Six Two*, a yin line in gradual ascent, responds to it. If one fails to recognize this as a time of withdrawing *qi* and that as a time of gradual yin growth, knowing only to maintain the old correspondence and move in step with the times, can this not still be called \"retreat that is *heng*\"? Not pursuing is precisely what makes for a good retreat. Otherwise, how could it be *heng*, how could it be great, how could it benefit the significance of the times and the act of retreat?\n\nThus, the noble person retreats from the world all day long, never for a single moment failing to retreat. Originally, this is not because one waits for petty persons to grow gradually before considering a return to seek *heng*. Would one die only when the time of gradual growth arrives? Hence it is said: \"The significance of retreat in its time is great indeed!\"\n\n*Initial Six* steps out the door and immediately associates with noble persons. If the noble person does not recognize this, he too will readily engage with them—this is failing to retreat at the very beginning. Only when, in the end, he sees their hearts are not of the same kind does he grow averse and retreat. Is this not too late? Can he avoid peril? Thus it is said: \"If one does not proceed, what disaster is there?\" This means that if one retreats at the outset and does not proceed, what peril could there be? As with Kou Zhun’s recommendation of Ding Wei and Zhang Jun, or Qin Hui and his two sons—once they seized power and gained the emperor’s favor, only then did others grow averse and retreat, only to be ensnared by them in the end. When Zhang Jun said to Emperor Gaozong, \"Only after dealing with him closely did I realize his darkness,\" the peril of retreating too late was most evident. In the hexagram, the top is the head, and the bottom is the tail, hence \"retreat at the tail.\"\n\n*Six Two* arrives precisely at the time of gradual yin growth, like Li Linfu of the Tang. When Linfu first saw Emperor Xuanzong trust Li Juezhi, he privately told Juezhi: \"Mount Hua is most auspicious, fitting for imperial tombs.\" Juezhi then reported this to Xuanzong. Delighted, Xuanzong immediately told Linfu, who feigned shock: \"Your servant did not know this, but Mount Hua is Your Majesty’s natal sign—how could it be lightly disturbed?\" Xuanzong then demoted Juezhi and revered Linfu, allowing Linfu to firmly secure the emperor’s favor. Qin Hui of the Song likewise used this tactic to strip the three great generals of their power and win Emperor Gaozong’s favor. This is what it means to personally seize someone in court, binding their hands and feet with the hide of a yellow ox so they cannot escape—yet those bound still do not understand. How pitiful! Why have they not studied the art of retreating from the world?\n\n*Three* is the master of *Gen* (☶, Keeping Still), sharing the same body. If one is bound and halted, the shared body falls ill, and peril must reach *Three*. However, *Two* and *Initial* are both long-standing servants and concubines: at home, *Three* is the master; in the state, *Three* is the superior. Though *Three* is bound, *Gen*’s firm yang resides above, naturally able to restrain the growing influence of its servants and concubines, allowing only minor matters and not great ones. What misfortune could there be? Since it is auspicious, what peril remains?\n\n*Nine Four* shares a fondness with *Initial*, turning back while still inclined toward it. The noble person’s good fortune needs no explanation. Since the noble person fares well, the petty person naturally fares ill and cannot burden the noble person. If one waits until the tail to retreat, how can one avoid sharing in their ill fate?\n\n*Five* recognizes that pursuit stems from fondness and thus alone admires retreat. This further reveals *Nine Five*’s will, which *Six Two* cannot firmly grasp. Hence, constancy brings good fortune. When the yang of right will honors what is admirable, the yin of firm will naturally has no means to sell its gradual growth. Thus, even if two yin lines daily encroach at *Nine Five*’s side, what harm is there? Yet only with a *Nine Five*-like ruler can one deeply admire a fond retreat. Such a ruler is rarely encountered in a thousand years, and the yang firmness of a thousand years will likewise be oppressed by the petty yin of small-minded persons.\n\nDi Renjie’s service under Empress Wu, or Feng Changle’s conduct during the Five Dynasties—hiding in the marketplace, acting amid peril and chaos, laboring with the turbid and emerging with the clear—each had their own way of wandering. Tao Hongjing refused to serve the Liang, Chen Tuan refused to serve the Song—this was resolute. Yet Li Bi, in commoner’s garb, met with Emperor Suzong at Lingwu; Liu Bingzhong, in monk’s robes, met with the emperor at Shangdu; and in our dynasty, Master Yao, from beyond the world, aided the Jingnan campaign. Even his elder sister, a former acquaintance, refused to see him, saying, \"This is the monk who kills people\"—yet Master Yao had no doubt in his actions. Is this not also a sorrowful wandering? Alas! Only thus can one cross safely, with nothing not favorable.",

      "translated_text": "Who but the \"Nine at the Top\" of Qian could bear this? Liu Yongxiang said: \"The mountain stands beneath heaven, still and unmoved—what flight could there be? To halt yet wander is to halt in excess. With feeling yet without feeling—how distant it is! Following the high, descending to the low, adapting to the world’s ways—how could one not detest it? Unshaken by disturbance, unshaken by quaking—how stern it is! Thus do petty men regard the noble: as if the noble pursued them, only to halt. Yet it is they who halt.\"\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Zizhan said: \"When yin flourishes in Pi and reaches Bo, the noble has never failed to dwell within its midst. Then, with two yin lying beneath four yang, yin still cannot overcome yang—yet the noble meets with misfortune. Why? The noble’s error is not one of abandonment or irretrievable loss; it is believed to hold the path of prosperity.\"\n\nYun said: \"Among the sixty-four hexagrams, the fifth line is always the ruler’s position. Yet sometimes one in this position lacks the ruler’s virtue, while another in a different position possesses it.\"\n\nJiao Ruohou said: \"The character *fei* (肥) was anciently written as *pi* (琶), resembling *bei* (輩). Later generations mistook *ling* (鸰) for *fei*.\" The *Nine Masters’ Daoist Teachings* states: \"To retreat yet take flight—what greater fortune could there be?\" Zhang Heng’s *Rhapsody on Contemplating the Mysterious* says: \"Longing to take flight and retreat to preserve one’s name.\" Cao Zhi’s *Seven Stimuli* declares: \"Taking flight to depart from the vulgar.\" The *Jinling She Mountain Stele* recalls: \"Cherishing thoughts of flight and retreat.\" All serve as evidence.\n\nWang Ji said: \"Petty men’s deep resentment arises from the noble’s provocation. Without malice yet stern—how could one incite hatred with harsh words or fierce demeanor? Speech is humble, conduct upright; appearance gentle, heart resolute. Seeking no flaws to slander, no blemishes to mar—stern as heaven, which none dare violate.\" In this hexagram, the first, fourth, second, and fifth lines correspond to four yang, governing with firmness—this is the image of \"without malice yet stern.\"\n\n**Hexagram 34: Great Vigour (Dazhuang) – Radiance in Rectitude**\n*The Judgment*: \"Great Vigour. Radiance in rectitude. The great is vigorous. Firmness in motion—thus vigour. Great Vigour. Radiance in rectitude. The great is rectitude. In rectitude and greatness, the sentiments of heaven and earth are revealed.\"\n*The Image*: \"Thunder above heaven—Great Vigour. The noble refrains from treading where propriety does not permit.\"\n- **First Nine**: \"Vigour in the toes. Advancing brings misfortune. Yet there is sincerity.\"\n  *The Image*: \"Vigour in the toes—its sincerity is exhausted.\"\n- **Nine in the Second**: \"Rectitude brings good fortune.\"\n  *The Image*: \"Nine in the Second’s rectitude brings good fortune—through centrality.\"\n- **Nine in the Third**: \"The petty man employs vigour; the noble employs restraint. Rectitude is perilous. The ram butts the fence, entangling its horns.\"\n  *The Image*: \"The petty man employs vigour; the noble employs restraint.\"\n- **Nine in the Fourth**: \"Rectitude brings good fortune; regret vanishes. The fence is breached, no entanglement. Vigour in the great carriage’s shafts.\"\n  *The Image*: \"The fence breached, no entanglement—advancing is esteemed.\"\n- **Six in the Fifth**: \"Losing the ram at Yi. No regret.\"\n  *The Image*: \"Losing the ram at Yi—position is inappropriate.\"\n- **Top Six**: \"The ram butts the fence, unable to retreat or advance. No advantage. Hardship brings good fortune.\"\n  *The Image*: \"Unable to retreat or advance—this is inauspicious. Hardship brings good fortune—misfortune does not endure.\"\n\n**Hexagram 34: Thunder over Heaven – Great Vigour**\nFang Shihua said: \"Only the Nine in the Fourth embodies the firm and active line, thus movement in rectitude brings good fortune. Movement dispels regret; the fence’s path opens wide, the carriage’s shafts are sturdy—how can one hesitate to advance? This is the great one’s vigour, hence *Great Vigour*; this is the great one’s rectitude, hence *Great Vigour*. Radiance in rectitude, greatness and rectitude—thus are heaven and earth. Without rectitude, how could one act? Thus the Nine in the Second, abiding centrally and unmoving, attains rectitude and good fortune. The First Nine, at the base and far from the thunder’s body—how could it hastily act? Thus its toes seem vigorous, yet advance brings misfortune. Even with yang’s solid sincerity, it will surely meet exhaustion. The Nine in the Third, though adjacent to thunder, still faces a fence—how can it recklessly butt? Overly firm and uncentered, it employs vigour directly—thus the sage says: this is the petty man’s affair; the noble must not act thus. When the noble encounters vigour, it knows only rectitude. Thus vigour may be possessed, but not employed. To employ vigour is perilous even in rectitude—like the ram butting the fence, its horns entangled. The horns are merely entangled, the fence remains unbreached—what is this if not restraint? Thus the image is borrowed to depict restraint’s form, a profound warning to the noble. Should one rely on the Six in the Fifth’s ease and overlook the error of employing vigour? Though the Fifth is easygoing and overlooks one’s error, does it not also overlook one’s merit? Emperor Wen of Han said: 'Alas! You did not meet your era. Had you lived in Gaozu’s time, a marquisate of ten thousand households would be nothing.' Thus he lost the ram at Yi. Emperor Wen, a ruler of gentle centrality, governed with ease, simplicity, and leniency. Though the many yang were vigorous, none employed their vigour. The ram, though sturdy, cannot be vigorous on level ground. Though the Fifth lost the ram, it remained unaware of regret—this is the art of governing, the method of halting movement. To restrain vigour’s force, leaving no fence to invite butting—is this not the excellence of the yielding overcoming the firm? Yet in the time of Great Vigour, one must not be complacent. The Top Six corresponds to the Third. The sage says: 'The ram butts the fence'—in its own line, this incurs the error of employing vigour, but in its proper correspondence, one must carefully examine the entangled horns’ hardship and the difficulty of union. It is not fitting to force it—unable to retreat or advance, advancing brings no advantage, and one remains forever burdened by the error of employing vigour.\"",

Yet Li Bi, in commoner’s garb, met with Emperor Suzong at Lingwu; Liu Bingzhong, in monk’s robes, met with the emperor at Shangdu; and in our dynasty, Master Yao, from beyond the world, aided the Jingnan campaign. Even his elder sister, a former acquaintance, refused to see him, saying, \"This is the monk who kills people\"—yet Master Yao had no doubt in his actions. Is this not also a sorrowful wandering? Alas! Only thus can one cross safely, with nothing not favorable.",

      "translated_text": "After traversing the Fourth and Fifth lines, one finally encounters such hardship—like Yi Yin with Tang. Yet while the world may suspect him of self-seeking and fault him for his culinary guise, Tang discerned in him a minister of singular virtue. Though the beginning was arduous, the end proved auspicious, and one may indeed be assured that no lasting fault would ensue.\n\nThe difficulty of encountering *Great Vigour* lies not merely in heeding its warning against employing force, nor in resolutely adhering to what is beneficial and upright. Rather, those in high position must broadly open the gates of rightful conduct, lest they allow entangled horns to persist. For in the time of *Great Vigour*, when the yang virtue flourishes, the donning of caps and the tying of sashes are inevitable even for the greatest worthies. The sage, in setting forth this image, establishes a stern admonition, seeking only to guide them toward rectitude.\n\nYet those in authority who fail to \"spit out their food\" or \"loosen their hair\" to gather such men—like the lord of Han Wen, whose virtue was not without merit—ultimately leave Li Guang unennobled and Jia Yi to die in resentment. How could they be so reckless with talent? Did they not regard others’ skills as their own, cherishing the wise and sagely as if they sprang from their own lips?\n\nThus, the Fifth Line speaks solely of its misplaced position, while the Top Line further judges its failure to deliberate and act accordingly.\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Zizhan said: \"In its upright greatness, the true sentiment of Heaven and Earth is revealed. To take the greater as the upright—this is the utmost sincerity of Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nYang Jian said: \"*Great Vigour* in Heaven and Earth manifests as the ascendancy of the four yang lines, where yang qi is most robust. In the state, it signifies the advancement of the noble multitude, whose momentum is mighty. In virtue, it represents the attainment of the Great Dao. When Confucius reached thirty, he stood firm—unshakable in his vigour. The yielding of the world cannot be vigorous; only the firm can be so. Yet even the firm, if unmoving, cannot display its vigour. Thus it is said: 'Through firmness in motion, vigour arises.'\"\n\nThe Nine in the Fourth, with its odd line obstructing its path, strikes the fence with entangled horns—an image of the Nine occupying the Third’s place. Moreover, at the culmination of the *Qian* hexagram, the petty man employs force. The Six in the Fifth, positioned ahead, is paired yet hollow, like a fence’s shadow.\n\nLiu Junbo said: \"*Qian* is the wheel and chariot; vigour resides in the wheel, and the wheel’s vigour lies in the shaft.\"\n\nYang Tingxiu said: \"The Six in the Fifth, amid the flourishing strength of the many yang below, is able to pacify them. Yet it loses itself—precisely through the virtue of yielding compliance and harmonious ease that subdues them. Thus, it incurs no regret. The ram represents the four yang lines.\"\n\n**Hexagram 35: Advance (Jin)**\n*Kang Hou* is granted horses in abundance, thrice received in a single day.\n\n**The Judgment** says: *Advance* means progress. Light emerges above the earth, compliant yet clinging to great brightness. The yielding advances and ascends—thus *Kang Hou* is granted horses in abundance and thrice received in a single day.\n\n**The Image** says: Light emerges above the earth—*Advance*. The noble one thereby illuminates his own bright virtue.\n\n**Line Statements**\n**Initial Six:** Advancing, yet crushed—persistent, auspicious. Without trust, yet at ease—no fault.\n**The Image** says: Advancing, yet crushed—walking alone in rectitude. At ease without fault—no mandate has been received.\n\n**Six in the Second:** Advancing, yet sorrowful—persistent, auspicious. Receiving this great blessing from the Queen Mother.\n**The Image** says: Receiving this great blessing—through central correctness.\n\n**Six in the Third:** The multitude assents—regret vanishes.\n**The Image** says: The multitude’s assent—its aspiration ascends.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Advancing like a hamster—persistent, perilous.\n**The Image** says: A hamster’s persistence in peril—its position is misplaced.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Regret vanishes. Loss and gain need not be fretted—going forth is auspicious, with no misfortune.\n**The Image** says: Loss and gain need not be fretted—going forth brings celebration.\n\n**Top Nine:** Advancing with its horns—only to be used in punishing its own domain. Perilous, yet auspicious—no fault. Persistent, regrettable.\n**The Image** says: Only to be used in punishing its own domain—the Dao is not yet radiant.\n\n**Fire over Earth: Advance**\nLight emerges above the earth—its Dao is greatly bright. *Advance* is the time of brightness. Here, it is not called \"bright advance\" but \"advancing advance\" because the single yielding line ascends and moves upward, dwelling at the center of *Li* and occupying the Fifth’s position, thereby illuminating all under Heaven. Thus, it is called \"advance.\" Moreover, the three yin lines of the *Kun* body are all lords who secure the state, compliant and advancing in unison to cling to the lord of great brightness—hence, it is also called \"advance.\" Advancing thus, *Kang Hou* is granted horses in abundance and thrice received in a single day. The \"three receptions\" refer to the three yin lines.\n\nNow observe the Six in the Fifth: as a lord of cultured brightness and yielding centrality, it broadly extends the earth’s measure, universally illuminating all. Toward the feudal lords of the time, whatever their losses or gains, it refrains from reckoning or contesting. Thus, those below are wholly seen in their sincerity, and going forth is auspicious, with no misfortune.\n\nThough a yin occupying a yang position should incur regret, dwelling at the center of *Li* with its virtue greatly bright, all below comply—thus, its regret vanishes.\n\nThe Initial Six, though advancing, is immediately crushed—this is not advancing with the gaze of advance. To advance yet be crushed is to regard advance as crushing. The Six in the Second, though advancing, appears sorrowful—this is regarding advance with sorrow, not advancing with the gaze of advance. Dwelling in a yielding, compliant position amid the bright time of *Advance*, why should there be crushing or sorrow? Yet the Initial Six, at the lowest position, suddenly ascends—if there is something above that crushes it, it dare not advance further, displaying the utmost humility and deference. Thus, its persistence is auspicious. It may be at ease, yet without trust—though it does not trust the Fourth, what fault is there? Walking alone in rectitude suffices.\n\nThe Six in the Second, centrally positioned, advances in *Advance*. Though advancement may be joyful, its center is not joyful—revealing its outward compliance and inner emptiness. Thus, its persistence is auspicious. Receiving this great blessing from the Queen Mother—is this not fitting?",

      "translated_text": "The Six in the Third, having reached the utmost of compliance, ascends in shared trust, its aspiration directed upward. Yet it ought not advance precipitously—only when the multitude consents may it proceed, for advancement harbors the seeds of regret, lest regret remain unavoidable.\n\nThe First, the Second, and the Third—all are compliant, all are marquises who pacify the state. From the Fifth’s perspective, all are deemed “obtained,” all are those of whom it is said: “Obtain and do not worry; to proceed is auspicious, while primacy brings no advantage.” Only the Fourth, with its Nine in residence, occupies a position not its own. With hardness lodged in advancement, it is not compliant. Active by night and hidden by day, it cannot advance in daylight—it is but a rat in the shadows. Dwelling beneath the radiance of *Clarity*, it dare not face the illumination of *Clarity*, thus forfeiting its own brightness. Yet from the Fifth’s perspective, it is precisely “loss without worry; to proceed is auspicious, while primacy brings no advantage.” If it cannot advance by day, how could it not be tolerated beneath the midday sky?\n\nThe Nine at the Top, excessively rigid, stands at the extremity of *Advance*. Taking the Fourth as its fellow townsman, it deploys force to subdue the town, unaware of the peril. Though it loves gain and detests loss, this is its good fortune; this is its freedom from blame; this is the way of rectitude. Yet regret and humiliation remain inescapable.\n\nAt this time, above stands a ruler who “loses without worry,” below stand ministers—crushed yet sorrowful, awaiting the multitude’s consent—above and below at peace, *Advance* unceasing, no leisure even to wield horns in victory. From this, it is clear: the defense of “three standards and five baits” would never be employed in an age of rotting grain and decaying coin. If only the world’s primal grievances are resolved, a single廷尉 suffices—why fret over rats usurping positions? Thus, the aged need not attend court with staff in hand—why bind the neck of the *Chanyu*? A Lu Jia is envoy enough—why fetter the head of the Southern Yue? Even if there were a young scion of Luoyang, a thousand gold pledged in a single vow, he would still die young in Daliang or grow old in Hebei—what profit lies in those who deploy force to subdue towns? Therefore it is said: “Deploying force to subdue towns—this Way is not yet luminous.”\n\nOnly when great clarity advances in broad daylight, its radiance resplendent, does compliance become effortless. This is why the *Kang* Marquis was granted steeds in abundance, received audience thrice in a single day. King Wen longed for such a time but could not attain it, hence his singular admiration.\n\nWhen brightness emerges above the earth, it is *Advance*; when it sinks beneath the earth, it is *Obscured Brilliance*—how grievous! Liu Yongxiang said: How do we know the three yin lines of *Advance* are all marquises who pacify the state? It is King Wen, the Nine Marquis, and the E Marquis—who in all the world for ten thousand generations would say otherwise? Rightly so, then, that he had no leisure for daytime audiences.\n\n**Appendix**",

      "translated_text": "Yang Jian said: \"The *Jie* hexagram signifies great transformation. The Grandmother is also called the Queen Mother, the tranquility of the king—likewise termed the Queen Mother. The *duan-shu* is the five-skilled rat, as Lu Mingde notes. The *Bencao* states the mole cricket is also called the *duan-shu*. Xu Shen’s *Shuowen* says: The *duan* is the five-skilled rat, able to fly yet unable to pass over a house, able to climb yet unable to scale a tree’s heights, able to swim yet unable to cross a valley, able to burrow yet unable to conceal itself, able to run yet unable to outpace others. *Xunzi* says: The *duan-shu*, though possessing five skills, remains trapped. Yang Lü’s annotated edition of the *Shuowen*—my fellow townsman Lou’s *Shangshu* also glosses the *Shuowen*—differs from the *Ode*’s *shuo-shu*.\n\nYang Tingxiu said: The second six, through its yielding virtue, encounters a lord of civil brilliance, occupying the position of advancement and flourishing. Abiding in the center and upholding correctness, it regards advancement with concern rather than delight. Thus it may attain good fortune and receive the great blessing of abundant steeds and thrice-daily audiences from its lord. The Queen Mother embodies the lord’s yielding center—this is the sixth five. Cheng Zhengshu said: The will ascends, desiring to rise and align with great clarity. To follow the lord of great brilliance—this is the shared aspiration of all. Wang Ji said: When the sun first emerges from the earth, advancing and ascending, it forms the image of *Advance*. When the sun rises above the earth, it is bright; when it sinks beneath, it is dark. The sun’s brilliance is fundamentally without increase or decrease—only a matter of being obscured or unobscured. The noble one, observing the image of brightness emerging above the earth, awakens to the inherent luminosity of the nature and substance, thus illuminating his own bright virtue. The noble one’s learning—whether called self-deception, self-entrapment, self-return, self-attainment, self-clarification, self-illumination, or self-knowledge—is never dependent on anything external.\n\n**Hexagram 36: *Mingyi* (Obscured Brilliance) – Fire below, Earth above**\n*Mingyi*: Beneficial to persist in adversity with steadfastness.\n\n**The Judgment** says: Brilliance enters the earth—*Mingyi*. Within, civil brilliance; without, yielding compliance, enduring great hardship—King Wen embodied this. Beneficial to persist in adversity with steadfastness: this is to obscure one’s brilliance. Though beset by internal strife, one can rectify one’s will—Jizi exemplified this.\n\n**The Image** says: Brilliance enters the earth—*Mingyi*. The noble one, in governing the multitude, employs obscurity to achieve clarity.\n\n**Line 1 (Nine at the bottom):** In *Mingyi*, it flies with drooping wings. The noble one, in travel, goes three days without eating. Though there is somewhere to go, the host has words [of reproach].\n\n**The Image** says: The noble one, in travel, righteously refuses to eat.\n\n**Line 2 (Six in the second place):** In *Mingyi*, wounded in the left thigh, employing a strong horse for rescue—good fortune.\n\n**The Image** says: The good fortune of the second six arises from compliance with principle.\n\n**Line 3 (Nine in the third place):** In *Mingyi*, hunting in the south, seizing the great chief—yet one must not hasten to steadfastness.\n\n**The Image** says: The will in southern hunting is to achieve great success.\n\n**Line 4 (Six in the fourth place):** Entering the left abdomen, grasping the heart of *Mingyi*, then exiting the gate and courtyard.\n\n**The Image** says: Entering the left abdomen, one seizes the heart’s intent.\n\n**Line 5 (Six in the fifth place):** Jizi’s *Mingyi*—beneficial to be steadfast.\n\n**The Image** says: Jizi’s steadfastness—brilliance cannot be extinguished.\n\n**Line 6 (Six at the top):** Not bright but dark—first ascending to heaven, later entering the earth.\n\n**The Image** says: First ascending to heaven, it illuminates the four lands. Later entering the earth—this is to lose principle.\n\n**Earth over Fire: *Mingyi***\nBoth the *Judgment* and *Image* speak of brilliance entering the earth. *Mingyi* originally only signifies the image of not seeing the sun and sky, the world’s darkness. The topmost line alone directly describes what is not bright but dark: first ascending to heaven, later entering the earth—this is the image of not bright but dark. Like King Zhou, though a ruler of unyielding strength, what could he do but lose principle? To lose principle is to abandon the Dao—thus he became dark. In *Mingyi*, none is more illustrious than King Wen. From the first to the fourth line, who but he could have embodied this? Though possessing inner civil brilliance and outer yielding compliance, he was not exempt from enduring great hardship. Thus, in the time of *Mingyi*, how could one not persist in adversity with steadfastness, fully obscuring one’s brilliance?\n\nThe *Mingyi* of the first nine begins at Youli. Its image: in flight, it droops its wings; in travel, it goes three days without eating; in going forth, the host has words. What could the sage do in such circumstances? Only submit to heaven. The *Mingyi* of the second six is also afflicted at Youli. Its image: wounded in the left thigh, one cannot but swiftly rescue it. Having rescued it, one cannot but employ a strong horse. This is to comply with the people’s hearts and align with heaven’s principles—good fortune indeed. The third nine is the conduct of all worthy ministers. What could the sage dare to know of this? Only to comply with the multitude. In the rites of the hunt, great beasts are offered to the lord, small beasts kept for oneself. As the *Ode* says: \"Privately I keep the fawn, but present the fattened boar to the lord\"—this is the way. The third nine hunts in the south of *Li*, seizing the great chief to present to the lord. The unknowing deem this hasty, but the wise regard it as steadfast—this is the sage’s great fulfillment of will. How could it be easily discussed with ordinary people? Thus, by the fourth six, one emerges from confinement. Entering the lord’s left abdomen, grasping the lord’s heart and intent, one at last exits the gate and courtyard to achieve survival. This is what is meant by: only after being wounded here does one emerge. The image: the lower three lines represent the sun falling to earth, possessing the image of entry. The fourth line, positioned above the setting sun, possesses the image of exit. Thus, from the fourth six downward, all represent King Wen’s *Mingyi*. The *Judgment*’s \"beneficial to persist in adversity with steadfastness\" is fully manifest here.\n\nWhen brilliance is not bright but instead becomes dark, even the sage cannot avoid entering the earth and being wounded. Yet when one persists in adversity with steadfastness and employs obscurity, even the most violent can grasp the heart’s intent and emerge above the earth.",
      "overlap_context": "e but could not attain it, hence his singular admiration.\n\nWhen brightness emerges above the earth, it is *Advance*; when it sinks beneath the earth, it is *Obscured Brilliance*—how grievous! Liu Yongxiang said: How do we know the three yin lines of *Advance* are all marquises who pacify the state? It is King Wen, the Nine Marquis, and the E Marquis—who in all the world for ten thousand generations would say otherwise? Rightly so, then, that he had no leisure for daytime audiences.\n\n**Appendix**",

      "translated_text": "Who would claim that the phrase \"beneficial to persist in adversity with steadfastness\" is not the subtle wisdom by which King Wen exited the gate and courtyard? The six in the fifth place, obscuring himself alongside the lord, truly embodies the *Mingyi* of Jizi. Feigning madness to avoid the deepest obscurity—yet people see only his obscurity, who knows how his brilliance never ceased? What is called \"the more obscure, the more brilliant\" was not merely unceasing in that moment, but persists through ten thousand ages without end. It is not that it does not cease, but that it *cannot* cease.\n\nXiong Nansha said: \"Great peril is the peril of the world; inner peril is the peril of a single household.\" Moreover, *Li* (Fire) possesses the image of a flying bird. *Kun* (Earth) represents the belly, and *Li* also represents the belly. Lü Zhongmu and Cai Jiefu noted: \"The heart lies in the left belly,\" as seen in medical texts. Scholar Li #12 said: \"Great peril is external peril. Only external peril can be strategized against, seeking exit is possible, for obscurity and brilliance do not enter. If it is inner peril, one cannot exit, nor can one enter—truly perilous indeed.\" Thus, Jizi’s *Mingyi* never ceases in obscurity, nor does his brilliance cease. The Master specifically praised this, without needing to reiterate the warning of \"persistence in adversity with steadfastness.\"\n\nHeaven and earth have their times of obscurity and brilliance; the sage moves in accord with the times, and thus cannot avoid turning toward obscurity to rest. If one were to say, \"I inwardly possess civil brilliance while outwardly appearing gentle and compliant, so I should not suddenly suffer great peril,\" this would inevitably lead to resentment toward heaven and blame of others. How could one know that inner civil brilliance must outwardly radiate light—how could it be concealed? Only when brilliance enters the earth, utterly obscuring its light, can primordial brilliance become visible, as with Jizi. This is deeply embodying the image of the *Yi*, aligning with the time of *Mingyi*. Thus, King Wen decisively recognized this as Jizi’s *Mingyi*, while viewing himself as deficient. How profound and admirable is one who knows not \"persistence in adversity with steadfastness\"! Were King Wen not a great sage, who could be moved to such self-reflection?\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Ji said: \"The sun rises majestically and sets in Yu Yuan—this is the image of *Mingyi*. The noble one observes the image of brilliance entering the earth and employs obscurity to become brilliant. For if one employs brilliance, one scrutinizes human sentiments, which leads to alienation and unease. Only by employing obscurity does brilliance attain the way of moving among the multitude. This is the meaning of 'hanging tassels and expanding light'—scrutinizing the fish in the abyss is inauspicious.\"\n\n*Li* below, *Xun* above: *Jiaren* (The Family). Beneficial for the woman to persist in steadfastness.\n**Judgment:** *Jiaren*: The woman holds her proper position within, the man holds his proper position without. When man and woman are correct, this is the great principle of heaven and earth. In the family, there is a stern lord—this refers to the parents. When father acts as father, son as son, elder brother as elder brother, younger brother as younger brother, husband as husband, and wife as wife, the family way is correct. When the family is correct, the world is settled.\n**Image:** Wind emerges from fire—*Jiaren*. The noble one, in speech, has substance, and in conduct, has constancy.\n\n**First Nine:** Guarding the household, regret vanishes.\n**Image:** Guarding the household—his aspiration has not changed.\n\n**Six in the Second:** Without self-seeking, engaging in central tasks, steadfastness brings good fortune.\n**Image:** The good fortune of the six in the second—submissive and yielding.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** The family sighs in distress—regret and danger, yet good fortune. The wife and children laugh recklessly—ultimately, humiliation.\n**Image:** The family sighs in distress—yet nothing is lost. The wife and children laugh recklessly—losing the family’s discipline.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** Enriching the household—great good fortune.\n**Image:** Enriching the household, great good fortune—submissive in one’s position.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** The king approaches the household—do not worry, good fortune.\n**Image:** The king approaches the household—mutual love.\n\n**Top Nine:** Possessing sincerity and dignity—ultimately, good fortune.\n**Image:** The good fortune of dignity—this means returning to oneself.\n\n**Feng Huo Jiaren**\nFang Shihua said: \"From the two women, the image of 'having a family' is taken, hence *Jiaren*. And it further emphasizes: 'beneficial for the woman to persist in steadfastness.'\" Reading the *Guan Ju* poem, moved by the music of zither, se, bells, and drums, I know the sage personally experienced its fullness. The Master joyfully praised it, saying: \"If the woman holds her proper position within, then the man must hold his proper position without. There has never been a man who could not hold his proper position without yet enable the woman alone to hold hers within.\" King Wen attributed virtue to the queen consort, hence he alone said: \"beneficial for the woman to persist in steadfastness.\" The Master attributed virtue to King Wen, hence he added: \"the man holds his proper position without\"—how profound!\n\nToday’s husband and wife are tomorrow’s parents. Today’s man and woman are tomorrow’s stern lords. If the positions of today’s man and woman are correct, then the positions of tomorrow’s father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife—none in the entire family will fail to be correct. Thus, it is said: \"When one family is correct, the world is settled.\" Alas! The settling of the world is seen in the family. The correctness of the family begins with man and woman. How then could man and woman be a trivial matter? How could the family be a trivial affair?\n\nWhen Yao bestowed his two daughters upon Yu, this was how he harmonized the myriad states. When Shun observed his conduct toward his two wives, this was how he yielded the throne and brought order to the world. The matter is not trivial, nor are the people insignificant—how clear this is! For all who have families, how can they not consider the benefit of the woman’s steadfastness in holding her proper position within, and model themselves after these two women to hold their proper position without?\n\nHolding one’s proper position without is to be a stern lord. Sternness does not mean sighing in distress or laughing recklessly. When one’s dignity is not forced yet appears dignified, when sincerity’s dignity arises without anger—this is good fortune. Returning to oneself to be correct, each resting in their proper place—this is dignity. Not esteeming sternness, yet the family all perceives a stern lord—this is what it means to hold one’s proper position without. Alas! Holding one’s proper position without—this is perfection.",

      "translated_text": "The noble person cherishes wealth but obtains it by the Way.\n\n**Appendix**\nXue Rengui said: \"When clarity resides within, the household naturally speaks with one accord. Internally, there is separation from clarity, while externally, compliance and harmony prevail.\"\n\nWang Fusi said: \"All teaching lies in the beginning, and all governance in the inception of the household. If one waits until records are kept before enforcing strict discipline, or until changes occur before implementing order, regret will follow. At the outset of managing a household, at the very beginning of its formation, one must first establish boundaries—only then can regret vanish.\"\n\nYang Jingzhong said: \"The Way of governing a household lies in preventing transgressions at the outset, so that deviant and perverse intentions never arise. Only then can regret be averted. It is not called 'the absence of initial regret' but 'the vanishing of regret' because governing a household is difficult—difficult indeed to avoid initial regret. Emperor Yao was a great sage yet could not prevent Dan Zhu from indulging in licentious company. The Duke of Zhou was a great sage yet could not stop Guan and Cai from spreading slander. Thus, it is indeed difficult to speak of avoiding initial regret.\"\n\nWei Xuanzheng said: \"The *Xiang Zhuan* states 'compliant and yielding,' referring to the second line rightfully submitting to the fifth. In all matters, one follows father and husband, never attaining one’s own will.\"\n\nXiong Nansha said: \"The sound *dīdī* was written as *gǎo* by Liu Xiang. The *Book of Songs* says, 'In harmony like *gǎo*,' while the *Zhou Odes* express *xī* most emphatically. *Yī* and *xī* are both exclamations, with *xīxī* being more intense than *gǎogǎo*. It is a sigh of unbearable frustration, not an instruction to laugh. Since the Han dynasty, all have pronounced it as the reverse of *dīdī*. Wang Hui of the Song doubted that the *Chonggang* hexagram originally contained laughter, yet he alone grasped the hexagram’s true sentiment. The third line, being strong, makes its wife and children unable to endure, sighing in distress. How could this not bring misfortune? It differs entirely from the awe-inspiring presence of the topmost line.\"\n\nYu Zhongxiang said: \"Holding position and responding to the initial line, submitting to the fifth while riding over the third, and aligning with the three yang lines—thus 'enriching the household is most auspicious.'\"\n\nJingzhong added: \"Both the second and fourth lines are yin and yielding, embodying utmost compliance. Compliance brings harmony, and harmony brings wealth. The proverb says: 'Ten people, ten minds—no wealth, only sealed markets. Ten people, one mind—wealth, golden markets.' This is true indeed.\"\n\nJin Rubai said: \"The second line holds the central position, hence it is called 'compliant.' Responding to the fifth and embodying yielding, it is called 'yielding'—meaning it can enter into harmony with the fifth through the Way of compliance.\" He further said: \"The fourth line is yin and empty, like the fourth line of *Tai*. Yet that one speaks of 'not enriching,' while this one speaks of 'enriching'—why? Because enrichment lies in the fourth, and thus enrichment lies in the fifth. The fifth, central and correct, occupies the honored position, while the fourth, by submitting to it, preserves its household. Hence it is said, 'compliant in position.'\"\n\nYang Tingxiu said: \"The fifth line, with the firm clarity of *Qian*’s virtue, resides in the central position of *Xun*, rightfully occupying the supreme place of the state and household, thereby influencing its family. King Wen as ruler, Tai Si as consort, Wang Ji as father, Tai Ren as mother, King Wu as son, and Yi Jiang as daughter-in-law—did they not love one another reciprocally? Thus the poet sang: 'He set an example for his humble wife, extending to his brothers, and so governed his state and household'—this is mutual love. Confucius praised him, saying, 'Without anxiety—this was King Wen.' This is 'no worry, auspicious.'\"\n\nWang Ji said: \"*Xun* is wind, *Li* is fire. When fire blazes, wind arises. Fire is the mother of wind. The noble person, observing the image of wind emerging from fire, understands that the root of moral transformation arises from the household. The root of the household, in turn, arises from the self. What emerges from the self? Only words and deeds. When words and deeds align, the self is cultivated. With self-cultivation, the Way of ordering the household, governing the state, and bringing peace to all under Heaven emerges from this. This is knowing the origin of wind.\"\n\n---\n**Fire above Marsh (38) *Kui*: Auspicious for minor matters.**\n**The *Tuan* says:** *Kui*: Fire moves upward, the marsh moves downward. Two women dwell together, yet their aspirations do not align. Joy clings to clarity; the yielding advances and ascends, attaining the center and responding to the firm—thus minor matters are auspicious. Heaven and Earth are apart, yet their affairs are the same; man and woman are apart, yet their aspirations commune; the myriad things are apart, yet their affairs are alike. The utility of *Kui* in its time is great indeed!\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** Fire above, marsh below—*Kui*. The noble person harmonizes while remaining distinct.\n\n**Line 1 (Yang):** Regret vanishes. A lost horse—do not pursue it; it will return of its own accord. Encountering an evil person—no blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Encountering an evil person is to avoid blame.\n\n**Line 2 (Yang):** Meeting one’s lord in the alley—no blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Meeting one’s lord in the alley is not losing the Way.\n\n**Line 3 (Yin):** Seeing a cart dragged back, its oxen restrained, its driver branded and mutilated—yet initially there was a good end.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Seeing a cart dragged back is due to an improper position. Initially there was a good end—this is encountering firmness.\n\n**Line 4 (Yang):** *Kui* in solitude, meeting the primal man, mutual trust—danger, no blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Mutual trust, no blame—this is the fulfillment of aspiration.\n\n**Line 5 (Yin):** Regret vanishes. One’s clan bites through flesh—where is the blame in advancing?\n**The *Xiang* says:** One’s clan bites through flesh—advancing brings good fortune.\n\n**Line 6 (Yang):** *Kui* in solitude, seeing a pig laden with mud, a cart full of ghosts. First drawing the bow, then lowering it—it is not a bandit but a marriage match. Advancing to meet rain—auspicious.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Meeting rain—auspicious, as all doubts vanish.\n\n**Fire and Marsh *Kui***\nFang Shihua said: \"Horses pair before moving. The first and fourth lines correspond—is this not a natural loss? Yet in the end, they unite—is this not 'do not pursue, it returns of its own accord'? However, the fourth is in *Kui* with the first, and the first resembles an evil person to the fourth. Now, if the first does not align with the fourth, this is *Kui*. Then the first is truly the 'primal man' to the fourth—what blame could there be? The lower follows the upper, hence the lower speaks of avoiding blame. The upper responds to the lower, hence the upper speaks of fulfilling aspiration.\"\n\nXiong Nansha said: \"The fourth is called '*Kui* in solitude'—below, it can still stand alone; above, it cannot lack support—this is so.\"",
      "overlap_context": "relations is not to add what is fitting with laughter. The *Shuowen* states: \"The sound of excess, 'enriching the household is most auspicious.'\" Yang Jingzhong and Jin Rubai have spoken well of this.\n\nTo take enriching the household as most auspicious, and to take enrichment as the power of compliance—when one holds position, enrichment is the urgent task of all who have families. Who would deem enrichment unworthy of the learning of the Dao? But one must obtain it by the Way.\n\nThus it is said:",

      "translated_text": "**The second and fifth lines form a proper correspondence.** Thus, the second attains its \"encounter in the alley,\" while the fifth personally relishes its concerns within its clan. For the second takes the fifth as its master, and the fifth takes the second as its origin—going forth brings felicity, so what blame could there be? *Li*’s center is empty, resembling an alley.\n\n**The top yang and third yin lines are excessively solitary in their estrangement,** yet as they encounter firmness, they must ultimately unite. At first, estrangement breeds doubt. If the third were to see the second dragging its carriage, the fourth pulling its ox upward, and the top descending from the heavens to slit its nose—would this not be so? In truth, how could such things exist? If the top were to see the third’s mount as no ox but a mud-smeared boar, its load as no person but a cartful of ghosts, it would first draw its bow, taking them for bandits to shoot—only later to recognize them as its marriage kin, lowering the bow without loosing the arrow. Doubts multiply, and thus the third and top become estranged. Yet when they go forth, they meet the rain, and all doubts dissolve—hence their final union.\n\n**Tuweng said:** Estrangement is the natural state of heaven and earth; estrangement resolving into union is their inevitable course. The *Xiang* commentary is exhaustive. Yet people in this world often create estrangement where none exists. Thus, some lines are fundamentally in correspondence yet become estranged—such is the case with the fourth and first. The first does not perceive estrangement; it is the topmost line that does. This is estrangement unseen, the estrangement of the highest. Some lines, though in mutual response, are not estranged—such are the second and fifth. When one goes forth, the other meets it; meeting, they unite; uniting, they flourish. Others are solitary yang without correspondence, inherently estranged—yet even they may come to see themselves as estranged, like the fourth line. Had it not encountered the primal man of the first yang, how could it have escaped the peril of solitude? When the fourth man meets the primal man, are they not two true men? Their mutual trust is fitting. Moreover, the fourth, upon meeting the primal man, immediately trusts him—this could not be so if it did not share the first’s aspiration. Thus it is said: \"Mutual trust brings no blame; the aspiration is fulfilled.\" Once the aspiration is realized, mutual trust follows naturally.\n\nAs for the third yin and top yang, they are a proper union of yin and yang, never exhibiting estrangement or solitude—yet the top perceives them as estranged, as bandits, as boars, as ghosts, in endless distortions. The sweetness of *Dui*’s marsh turns to mud—how absurd! The third, meanwhile, sees the second dragging its carriage, the fourth pulling its ox, and the top descending from the heavens to slit its nose—how bizarre! They are not estranged, yet they see estrangement—such is the nature of most estrangement in the world. Hence it is said: \"There is a beginning, there is an end.\" And again: \"Meeting the rain brings good fortune.\" Was the rain not always the rain of *Dui*’s marsh? Did it ever lose its beginning or fail to correspond? Seeing estrangement, one calls it a beginning without end, inauspicious; seeing union, one calls it an end, auspicious. How grievous is the harm of perception!\n\nIn this hexagram, only the fifth yin line, centered and responsive, corresponds with the second yang’s firmness. Thus, the fifth goes forth to meet the second, and the second bears the fifth’s going. Is this not like Emperor Taizu of Song visiting Prime Minister Pu on a snowy night, where Pu’s wife served wine and roasted meat over glowing coals—the very \"encounter with the master in the alley\" and \"the clan relishing the flesh\"?\n\nAs for the first line, the marsh stirs below, delighting in the marsh’s sweetness and willingly dwelling in filth—it harbors no intent of estrangement. Thus, the horse may be lost, yet it may also return. If lost, let it be lost of its own accord—who could pursue it? If it returns, let it return of its own will—who could compel it? Such is its indifference to the world’s concerns. And this is not all.",

      "translated_text": "The wicked are those no one wishes to see—yet are they not also human? Why then set oneself apart in estrangement? Fault is what all seek to avoid—yet am I not human as well? Why then insist on separation? Thus, the first line alone is called the \"primordial man,\" and truly so. As for the primordial man, how fortunate is the fourth yang to have such an encounter! Below the primordial man lies the second yang’s firmness and centeredness—its firmness and centeredness that bring about the \"encounter in the alley.\" And below that, does not the topmost yang’s firmness also meet? Without the top’s firmness, how could the third achieve its good end? Therefore, the noble person values firmness.\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Shi’s explanation: If one knows only conformity, then estrangement is inevitable. If one knows that estrangement can lead to achievement, then conformity is assured.\nThe Bald Elder says: If one knows only conformity, then estrangement is inevitable. If one knows that one cannot but be estranged, then conformity is assured. Thus it is said: In their shared dwelling, the two women’s aspirations differ, and in the end, each returns to her own place. How could they not be estranged? Yet when they are estranged, heaven and earth are estranged, yet their work is the same—they share the task of generating life. Male and female are estranged, yet their aspirations commune—they share the intent of mutual response. The myriad things are estranged, yet their tasks are of a kind—they share the work of nurturing life. How then could they not be in accord? Alike yet different, estranged yet united—from heaven and earth downward, none is not thus. Therefore it is said: The utility of the time of estrangement is great indeed! When it speaks of \"small matters being auspicious,\" it is because yang is great and yin is small, and the image is taken from the two women’s differing paths. Yet only after their estrangement do they each find union, and thus it is specifically stated: \"small matters are auspicious.\" This does not mean that estrangement is only auspicious for small matters.\n\nYang Jian says: The fourth and first lines are both yang, an image of two yangs fundamentally unresponsive, hence estrangement and solitude. Yet the first yang is bright, bearing the image of the primordial man—its estrangement arises from mutual unawareness. Once aware, their hearts would be mutually trusting. The second and fifth lines are properly responsive; if the fifth yin can employ the second yang, then the marsh’s blessings will cover all under heaven, and the people will all rely on its grace. The ruler should seek the worthy, and only then will the worthy follow—thus the fifth yin must take the initiative. Li Taifa says: Affection turns to estrangement through doubt; only firmness can dispel doubt and bring union. Thus the fourth ultimately meets the primordial man, and the top ultimately meets the rain.\n\nCai Jiefu says: The Dao is the correct Dao. This explains the meaning of the word \"alley.\"\n☶ below ☵ above: *Jian*.",

Seeing danger and being able to stop—how wise! *Jian* is favorable in the southwest because going there attains the center; unfavorable in the northeast because its path is exhausted. Favorable to see the great person because going there brings success. Being in the proper position and steadfast brings good fortune, for it rightly orders the state. The timely application of *Jian* is truly great!\n\n*The Image* says: Water above the mountain—*Jian*. The noble person turns inward to cultivate virtue.\n\n**First Six:** Going brings difficulty; coming brings praise.\n*The Image* says: Going brings difficulty; coming brings praise—it is fitting to wait.\n\n**Six in the Second:** The king’s minister faces repeated difficulties, not for the sake of self.\n*The Image* says: The king’s minister faces repeated difficulties—ultimately without blame.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** Going brings difficulty; coming brings return.\n*The Image* says: Going brings difficulty; coming brings return—inner joy.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** Going brings difficulty; coming brings connection.\n*The Image* says: Going brings difficulty; coming brings connection—being in the proper position is substantial.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** Great difficulty, friends come.\n*The Image* says: Great difficulty, friends come—through central moderation.\n\n**Top Six:** Going brings difficulty; coming brings greatness, good fortune; favorable to see the great person.\n*The Image* says: Going brings difficulty; coming brings greatness—its aspiration is inward. Favorable to see the great person—following the noble.\n\n*Water above Mountain: Jian*\n*Jian* is the image of feet struggling to advance, hence it is called difficulty. The cause of difficulty is the peril of *Kan* ahead. This hexagram combines outer peril with inner stillness, so facing difficulty, one stops—thus it is called *Jian*. Yet seeing peril and being able to stop is called wisdom. However, stopping without going is the power of *Gen*’s stillness. The third line, as the master of *Gen*’s stillness, is especially relied upon. Thus all six lines speak of \"going,\" showing that while coming is possible, going is not. Yet the hexagram repeatedly says \"favorable in the southwest\" and \"favorable to see the great person\"—why does it seem to insist on going? Precisely because seeing peril and being able to stop can be called wisdom in not going, but if one does not also speak of going to see the great person in the fifth *yang* line, how can one attain the good fortune of \"going to attain the center\" and \"going to bring success\"? Thus, while going into peril is certainly inadvisable, is going to attain the center or bring success also inadvisable? The position of the fifth *yang* is in the southwest, the place of central attainment, a peril-free zone where one should stop. Moreover, with *yang* in the fifth, properly positioned and centrally correct, it rightly orders all states and brings peace to all nations—truly one whom the four directions find it favorable to see. Only those lacking wisdom fail to recognize this, mistakenly believing the fifth line remains in peril, unable to escape danger themselves, let alone benefit others. Little do they know that while the world sees peril, the worthy of the second *yang* alone recognize it as a peril-free center. Thus it is called wisdom. Therefore, all six lines speak of \"going brings difficulty; coming brings good fortune,\" with the auspicious phrase reserved for the top line to represent all five, using the outer to reveal the inner—a rhetorical economy. Thus, all going is difficult and inadvisable, while all coming is auspicious—bringing praise, freedom from blame, inner joy, substantial connection, or greatness with good fortune. Only coming is possible; going is not. Yet who knows there is an even greater difficulty, like the fifth line? While ordinary difficulty forbids going, the great difficulty of the fifth line paradoxically invites it. While ordinary difficulty is called wisdom for not going, the great difficulty of the fifth line brings good fortune and harmony precisely by going to join it. Here, going is stopping, and this stopping is true wisdom. The reason lies in the fifth *yang*’s firm centrality and ability to moderate. *Jie* means restraint, steadfast and unmoving. Amid peril, the great person of *Jian* is one whom all lines find it favorable to see—hence \"central moderation.\" Is not the timely application of *Jian* truly great?\n\nThe first line, going nowhere and coming instead, gains praise. Praise comes from knowing when to stop and thus attaining. The second line, bound as the king’s minister, should not go—yet does not go not for self-love, but because minister and ruler share the same difficulty. The second line has pondered this deeply, hence \"ultimately without blame.\" Only the third line, master of *Gen*’s stillness, can come, returning to the fifth, so the two inner lines rejoice in their shared aspiration. The third *yang*, firm and properly positioned, is substantial and great, so the fourth line connects with it, and friends come. The top line’s aspiration is for the third, the great person. With thoughts aligned, seeing the fifth line’s great person becomes effortless.\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Shi’s explanation: Being in the proper position and correct is the fifth line. The fifth line is the great person, thus standing amid peril yet able to rightly order the state. What others avoid—peril—he alone finds secure. This must be one capable of bearing the world’s greatest difficulties.\n\nThe disciples of Xiang said: If it is not peril, it is not *Jian*. Seeing peril and stopping—this is *Jian*.\n\nWang Fusi said: At the beginning of difficulty, in the initial moment of stillness, with unique foresight, seeing peril and stopping—how wise!\n\nXiong Nansha said: \"Going\" refers to *Kan*; \"coming\" refers to *Gen*.\n\nShen Cunzhong said: *Jianjian* means the fifth is difficult, and the second is also difficult. *Shuo* means great, distinguished from \"great difficulty\" by not using \"great.\" Hence \"aspiration is inward,\" clarifying its response to the third line. *The Original Meaning* says coming to the fifth would be redundant with \"seeing the great person.\"",

      "translated_text": "Wang Ji said: Ahead lies perilous terrain, behind stand towering barriers—this is the image of *Jian*. The noble person observes the image of *Jian* and turns inward to cultivate virtue. Mencius said: \"When one’s actions yield no success, one should turn inward and seek within oneself.\" Turning inward takes the back of *Gen*; cultivating virtue takes the heart of *Kan*.\n\nZhou Yan said: Turning inward takes *Kan*—the image of water’s difficulty in movement. Cultivating virtue takes *Gen*—the image of the mountain’s constant stillness.\n\n*Kan* below, *Zhen* above.\n\n**Explanation:** Favorable in the southwest. No place to go—its return is auspicious. Where there is somewhere to go, early action brings good fortune.\n\n**The *Tuan* says:** *Xie* is peril set in motion; moving, one escapes peril—this is *Xie*. *Xie* is favorable in the southwest—going forth gains the multitude. Its return is auspicious, for it attains the center. Where there is somewhere to go, early action brings good fortune, for going forth yields merit. Heaven and earth release, and thunder and rain arise; thunder and rain arise, and the hundred fruits, herbs, and trees all split their husks—how great is the timing of *Xie*!\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** Thunder and rain arise—this is *Xie*. The noble person thereby pardons transgressions and forgives sins.\n\n**First Six:** No blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** At the juncture of firm and yielding, there is no blame in principle.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** Hunting, one captures three foxes and obtains a yellow arrow—steadfastness brings good fortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Nine in the Second’s steadfast good fortune lies in attaining the central path.\n\n**Six in the Third:** Bearing a burden while riding in a carriage invites bandits to arrive—steadfastness brings regret.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Bearing a burden while riding in a carriage—how shameful! Bringing armed conflict upon oneself—who else is to blame?\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Releasing the toe, friends arrive and trust is established.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Releasing the toe—this is not the proper position.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** The noble person is bound yet released—auspicious. There is trust in the petty person.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The noble person is released—the petty person retreats.\n\n**Top Six:** The duke shoots a wild goose on the high bank, capturing it—nothing is unfavorable.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The duke shoots the wild goose to resolve perversity.\n\n*Thunder over Water: Xie*\n\nFang Shihua said: When peril remains unresolved, all going forth is *Jian*, and all returning is auspicious—one may return but may not go forth. Once resolved, not only is return auspicious, but one also attains the central position of Nine in the Second and finds stability. Though going forth, early action still brings good fortune, for one thereby achieves the image of resolving peril and merits success. Thus it is said: Favorable in the southwest—going forth gains the multitude. Where there is somewhere to go, early action brings good fortune, for going forth yields merit. Hence both *Jian* and *Xie* speak of being favorable in the southwest. Yet *Jian*’s southwest refers to Nine in the Fifth—the central position amid peril—while *Xie*’s southwest refers to the second, fourth, and top lines—the multitude of positions resolving peril. Thus *Jian* speaks of going forth as if speaking of coming, hence: \"Great *Jian*—friends come to resolve it.\" Speaking of going forth, it focuses solely on going forth, hence: \"No place to go.\" Speaking of going forth, it immediately brings early good fortune. Why is there no good fortune in \"no place to go\"? Above the second, one shoots the fourth—having resolved, one acts. Three make a multitude. Why does the hexagram uniquely place Six in the Third at the extreme of peril, with no correspondence? Precisely because it invites peril. Top Six corresponds with Three yet does not respond—if not shooting and capturing, it must share in the peril. How could it escape the hands of one who remains centered and unmoving? Observing First Six’s lack of blame and Nine in the Fourth’s trust among friends, it is clear that capturing it brings no disadvantage. Thus when Nine in the Fourth moves and emerges from peril, First Six responds, and no blame ensues. When Four moves to release the toe, First Six responds, and trust among friends is established. If one man stirs trouble, those who align with him all suffer its consequences. Once peril is resolved, those who align and those who respond all establish trust—this is both the natural course and the proper principle. Thus it is said: At the juncture of firm and yielding, there is no blame in principle.\n\nYet this hexagram is called *Xie* due to the power of Nine in the Second, who remains centered and unmoving, and whose success depends on employing the right person—namely, the duke who shoots the wild goose, a man who stores his talents and awaits the right moment to act. As for Four, it marks the beginning of movement. When in peril, one cannot act lightly; the moment one moves, one escapes peril. Thus Four releases its toe and acts. Once the toe moves, it does not stop again. Friends arrive, and trust is established—their kind all move in response. Yet Four merely enjoys the outcome and attains resolution; it is not the one who resolves peril in this hexagram. Thus it is said: This is not the proper position.\n\nSix in the Fifth, yielding and centered, sees resolution and acts, then delights in saying: \"The noble person is bound yet released—auspicious,\" implying that once released, good fortune follows without further action. This single thought not only establishes trust among friends but also among petty persons. Thus it is said: There is trust in the petty person. When the noble person is released, petty persons naturally submit and retreat. Once released and having retreated, what more is there to do? Otherwise, if trust is not established at heart, though resolved, it is as if unresolved, and the world’s affairs arise anew. Can one not take warning from the events of the Song? Petty persons initially wish to share caution with the noble person to preserve their wealth and status, rather than oppose them and lose their position. Only when the noble person’s resentment toward petty persons remains unresolved do petty persons constantly fear losing their position and turn to bite back, their poison deepening and becoming irresolvable. Thus the calamity of petty persons ultimately becoming irresolvable is always preceded by the noble person’s failure to resolve. This is the great mechanism of order and chaos throughout the ages, and thus the sage repeatedly emphasizes it here. Six in the Fifth, yielding and centered, occupies the honored position—one who can resolve entanglements. It no longer engages in perilous undertakings. Emperor Wen of Han is an example.\n\n**Appendix**\nLi Dingzuo said: Nine in the Fourth embodies *Zhen*, which is the foot’s toe.",

      "translated_text": "**Hexagram 41: Sun (Decrease)**\n\n*Sun*: Possessing sincerity, supreme fortune, no blame, proper and steadfast; beneficial to have somewhere to go. What is it used for? Two sacrificial vessels may be used for offering.\n\n**The Judgment** says: *Sun* means decreasing below to increase above, its Dao moving upward. Decreasing with sincerity brings supreme fortune, no blame, proper steadfastness, and benefit in having somewhere to go. What is it used for? Two sacrificial vessels may be used for offering. The use of two vessels has its time; decreasing the firm to increase the yielding has its time. Decrease and increase, fullness and emptiness—these move in accord with the seasons.\n\n**The Image** says: Below the mountain is the marsh—this is *Sun*. The noble person thereby restrains anger and suppresses desires.\n\n**Line 1 (Initial Nine):** Completing affairs and letting go of the past—no blame. Considerately decrease it.\n**The Image** says: Completing affairs and letting go of the past—this accords with the will.\n\n**Line 2 (Nine Two):** Beneficial to be steadfast; advancing brings misfortune. Do not decrease it to increase it.\n**The Image** says: Nine Two’s benefit in steadfastness—its will is centered.\n\n**Line 3 (Six Three):** When three people walk, one is decreased; when one person walks, they gain a companion.\n**The Image** says: When one person walks, three cause doubt.\n\n**Line 4 (Six Four):** Decreasing one’s illness brings joy in the aftermath—no blame.\n**The Image** says: Decreasing one’s illness—this too is cause for joy.\n\n**Line 5 (Six Five):** Someone increases it with a tortoise worth ten *peng*—it cannot be refused; supreme fortune.\n**The Image** says: Six Five’s supreme fortune—it is aided from above.\n\n**Line 6 (Top Nine):** Do not decrease it to increase it—no blame; steadfast and fortunate; beneficial to have somewhere to go; gaining ministers and a great household.\n**The Image** says: Do not decrease it to increase it—this greatly fulfills the will.\n\n**Mountain and Marsh: Decrease**\nDecrease and increase are matters of the same moment. In this hexagram, decrease is spoken of first and increase afterward to show that all decrease is for the sake of benefit. If it were not for great benefit, why would one hastily decrease? Only when decrease brings sincerity, supreme fortune, no blame, proper steadfastness, and benefit in having somewhere to go—only when it brings such great benefit—is it truly decrease. Otherwise, why would one decrease? Thus, the question *\"What is it used for?\"* makes its meaning clear. Therefore, without increasing the yielding, decreasing the firm cannot be accomplished; without benefit in offering, decreasing the two vessels cannot be accomplished. Thus, decreasing the firm is for increasing the yielding—if the yielding does not increase the firm, one cannot hastily decrease. Decreasing the two vessels is because they may be used for offering at the proper time. If they are not used for offering, how can the vessels be hastily decreased? Therefore, when the time calls for increase, even heaven and earth, sages and worthies cannot but decrease to achieve their benefit. Only when it comes to increase is decrease no longer spoken of. Thus, in the *Judgment* of *Increase*, decrease is not mentioned; in its lines, decrease is not mentioned; in the *Judgment* and line texts of *Increase*, decrease is not mentioned. Only in the hexagram of *Decrease* is it spoken of—from this, one may know that decrease must bring benefit. And once there is benefit, it is as if no decrease ever occurred. Thus, *Increase* alone does not speak of decrease.\n\nIn the hexagram of *Decrease*, the first line speaks of considerate decrease, the fourth of decreasing illness, the second and top lines both speak of not decreasing to increase, and the third actually decreases the firm to increase the yielding of the top nine. Yet the third regains a companion—though it decreases, it is not truly decreased, but rather benefits. Though it decreases, it brings sincerity, supreme fortune, no blame, proper steadfastness, and benefit in having somewhere to go. Thus, one may say it decreases, or one may say it does not decrease, or one may say it decreases yet benefits. From this, the Dao of decrease can be understood. Therefore, the hexagram of *Decrease* is placed first.\n\nNow observe the three yang lines of *Qian*: when one decreases them to benefit *Kun*, and *Kun*’s lines increase the top nine, it becomes *Gen*; when *Qian*’s lines decrease the three yang, it becomes *Dui*. Six Four, residing below the stillness of *Gen*, newly becomes a neighbor to the joy of *Dui*—its illness is clearly from *Dui*. What brings joy is that Six Four’s affairs are completed by the initial nine, which has long shared a sincere bond. If the initial nine can let go of the past to uphold this shared will, then Four’s illness will naturally decrease. For Four’s illness originally arose from losing harmony, so now, upon regaining harmony, its illness decreases. Thus, the initial nine incurs no blame, and Four also incurs no blame. Therefore, what the initial nine should considerately address is only letting go of the past—there is nothing to decrease. If Six Five were suddenly to increase the yang of the top nine, as if someone increased it with a tortoise worth ten *peng*, which cannot be refused and whose origin is unknown, this would bring supreme fortune. What need is there for the aid of two like-minded ones letting go to benefit it? If Nine Two were to let go, it would bring misfortune in advancing. Thus, it is said: *\"Nine Two’s benefit in steadfastness—its will is centered.\"* This means the sincerity of shared will resides within; it is beneficial to be steadfast and requires no decrease. Then who is it that decreases? Is it not Six Three? Thus, when the three yang decrease one, Six Three becomes the walk of one person—it seems to decrease yet doubts its original companion. However, the upper trigram gains one yang, becoming Six Three’s proper correlate. Thus, though Six Three doubts the decrease, it is in fact sitting and gaining a companion—it too has not truly decreased.\n\nFrom this perspective, the initial line does not decrease, the second does not decrease, and though the third seems to decrease, it has not truly decreased. The top nine, though it greatly receives benefit, is also increased without decrease. Its words—no blame, steadfast and fortunate, beneficial to have somewhere to go, gaining ministers and a great household—all pertain to the top nine receiving benefit and greatly fulfilling its will. The hexagram statement and *Judgment* are entirely consistent. If it regains a companion, how has it truly decreased? The three become the walk of one person—thus, it is also said to gain ministers and a great household. Or one might ask: Why does the initial nine speak of Six Four’s completed affairs? At the beginning of *Tai*’s exchange, *Kun*’s Six Four, though harmonious and aligned, though a neighbor to Nine Three, does not guard its center. Yet it sincerely responds to its proper correlate, the initial nine—thus, it is clear that the initial nine is the one who completed Six Four’s affairs.",

      "translated_text": "Now, when Qian’s Nine Three suddenly diminishes itself to augment the top, reducing nine to form Dui, a single yin arrives to take its place—thus, Six Four loses its position and its harmonious alignment, its former grace now vanished. Is this not the malady of reckless excess? What is to be celebrated, however, is that the initial Nine does not forget its shared aspiration to ascend, and with serene resolve, it advances to console Six Four. Once Six Four again beholds the one who had completed its affairs, its affliction naturally lessens, and the one who was sent forth brings joy—this is only fitting.\n\nThus, in *Sun* (Diminishing), the initial Nine is indeed the one who completed Six Four’s affairs, while in *Yi* (Augmenting), the initial Nine is no longer the same, for it dares not overburden those below. As the timely transformation states: “Diminishing below to augment above—its Dao moves upward.” This refers to the lower trigram’s single yang now ascending, so that the Dao advances above, diminishing yet holding true. How could this not be supremely auspicious, blameless, correct, and beneficial for progress?\n\nTherefore, the *Commentary* retains these words precisely to show that diminishing brings benefit. **Appendix:** Lu Bolai says: “Offerings require the full array of vessels; the use of two sacrificial stands is fitting only in the time of *Sun*, not as a constant practice.” For hardness and softness are the great divisions of the world. Diminishing the hard to augment the soft is fitting only at certain times. Diminishing and augmenting, fullness and emptiness—these move in accord with the times. The transformations of Heaven and Earth: when excess is diminished, insufficiency is augmented; when loss occurs, gain follows. If Heaven and Earth had intent, it would be only to move in step with the times.\n\nThe various masters say: In the rites of offering, displaying achievements with eight sacrificial stands is abundant, four is moderate, and two is meager. Xiong Nansha says: The formation of the *Sun* hexagram lies in the third line, where the top two lines form Dui with two yang. Cai Qing says: Two cowries make a *peng*. In antiquity, cowries served as currency, and a *peng* was worth two hundred sixteen. Wang Ji says: “Curb anger as if toppling a mountain; stifle desire as if sealing a hole.”\n\n☴☳ *Yi* (Augmenting): Beneficial to have somewhere to go; beneficial to ford the great river.\n**Judgment:** *Yi* means diminishing above to augment below, so the people rejoice without limit. When the superior descends to those below, its Dao shines greatly. Beneficial to have somewhere to go—central correctness brings good fortune. Beneficial to ford the great river—the Dao of wood proceeds. *Yi* moves and yields, advancing without limit. Heaven bestows, Earth produces—its augmentation is boundless. The Dao of all augmentation moves in accord with the times.\n**Image:** Wind and thunder—*Yi*. The noble person, seeing goodness, emulates it; having faults, corrects them.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n- **Initial Nine:** Beneficial to undertake great works; supremely auspicious, no blame.\n  **Image:** Supremely auspicious, no blame—those below do not overburden themselves.\n- **Six Two:** Someone augments it with a tortoise worth ten *peng*, which cannot be refused. Eternally correct, auspicious. The king uses it to offer to the Supreme, auspicious.\n  **Image:** Someone augments it—this comes from without.\n- **Six Three:** Augmenting is used for inauspicious affairs, no blame. Holding true to the central path, it announces to the duke with a jade tablet.\n  **Image:** Augmenting is used for inauspicious affairs—this is inherently so.\n- **Six Four:** On the central path, it announces to the duke, who follows. Beneficial to rely upon for relocating the state.\n  **Image:** The duke follows its announcement—to augment its aspiration.\n- **Nine Five:** Holding true with a generous heart—do not ask, supremely auspicious. Holding true, it graciously bestows virtue upon me.\n  **Image:** Holding true with a generous heart—do not ask. Graciously bestowing virtue upon me—greatly fulfilling its will.\n- **Top Nine:** No one augments it; someone strikes it. Establishing the heart without constancy—misfortune.\n  **Image:** No one augments it—this is partial speech. Someone strikes it—this comes from without.\n\n**Wind and Thunder: Yi**\nDiminishing Qian’s Nine Four’s single yang to augment the lower trigram’s initial Nine is augmenting below—this is the affair of the lord alone. Only Nine Five’s generous heart can truly hold fast. Thus, there is the good fortune of eternal correctness. It truly receives the treasure yet does not know whence the augmentation comes. With the good fortune of offering to the Supreme, it shares in the blessing and together with Five fulfills Heaven’s will—this is how the second line receives augmentation. But is it only the second? The third also holds true to Five’s ability to augment below. The second occupies the center, and the third likewise participates, thus both are called “central path.” The second offers to the Supreme, and the third likewise participates, thus it may announce to the duke with a jade tablet.\n\nNow, when Nine Five alone augments below, all below trust it and truly receive its benefit. How could such sincerity and generosity not be evident? Moreover, this initial Nine is precisely the one beneficial for great undertakings, when thunder moves and wind spreads. With yang virtue so manifest, with such stirring power—how could the lower trigram now resemble the former *Kun*, thick and reluctant to act on its own? Its supreme auspiciousness and blamelessness are beyond doubt.\n\nYet when the lower trigram’s three yin lines suddenly gain a yang to reside in the second, the initial line naturally takes on the image of “someone augmenting it with a tortoise worth ten *peng*.” Only the second, gaining yang, is worth ten *peng*, so the third, losing yang, faces inauspicious affairs. For the third and fourth lines are neighbors, and Six Three’s possession of Nine Four was long established. Though now augmented by the initial Nine’s auspiciousness, it cannot avoid losing Nine Four’s inauspiciousness. Is this not “augmenting used for inauspicious affairs”? Yet while the third suffers loss in the outer trigram, it ultimately gains in the inner trigram. Thunder shares the same body. With yang arriving to reside in the initial line, yang Nine is ultimately Six Three’s inherent possession. Thus it is said: “Augmenting used for inauspicious affairs is inherently so.” This means it has not truly suffered loss, so it is not inauspicious.\n\nSix Four may also be called “central path,” for Five occupies the center to augment below, and Four likewise aspires to augment below, aligning with the center in its conduct. Thus, the duke follows its announcement and may come to rely upon the state relocated by the initial Nine. Therefore, it is said: “Beneficial to rely upon for relocating the state.” Though Six Four is yin and soft, it truly augments its aspiration by following Five’s augmentation of those below—this is what it means to hold true with a generous heart.",

      "translated_text": "The initial yang, being the yang that benefits those below, is already supremely auspicious—how much more so when the noble Five alone diminishes above to augment it? Its supreme auspiciousness need not even be questioned. Thus, those who truly receive its benefit ought to hold faith in its virtuous power. The aspiration to benefit those below reaches its utmost fulfillment here.\n\nAs for the upper Nine, though it possesses the sincerity of a generous heart, it seeks a response to its virtuous power. Thus, with a mind not merely passive but actively seeking the resonance of trust, its words are not one-sided. Hence it is said: “None align with it, and thus harm befalls it.” Without virtuous power, there is only the threat of attack. The retribution of cause and effect is manifest and inescapable. Those who govern must ever reflect on the generous heart that takes benefiting those below as its aspiration.\n\n“Diminishing above to augment below brings boundless joy to the people”—this refers to the two lines Six Two and Six Three. Regarding Six Two, it may receive the augmentation of a ten-stringed tortoise-shell oracle; regarding Six Three, it employs augmentation for inauspicious affairs. Thus, from above to below, the Dao shines brightly—this speaks solely of the initial Nine’s supreme auspiciousness and absence of blame. The phrases “beneficial to have somewhere to go” refer jointly to the initial Nine and Six Four. The former is beneficial for great undertakings, while the latter is beneficial for reliance. The relocation of the state is how Nine Five’s aspiration to benefit those below attains its full realization. Hence it is said: “Central and correct, there is cause for celebration.” The phrases “beneficial to ford the great river” refer solely to Six Four as the master of compliance. As the *Xiang* says, “Announcing to the duke and gaining his compliance fulfills its aspiration.” Thus it is said: “The Dao of wood proceeds.”\n\nThe statement “Augmentation moves in compliance; heaven bestows, earth produces” encompasses the entire hexagram, clarifying that the Dao of augmentation invariably advances in accord with the times.\n\nWang’s *He* says: “Three and Two both receive augmentation from above and are able to announce to the duke and employ the jade tablet, so Three is also called ‘central path,’ meaning it aligns its conduct with Two’s centrality. Four and Five both take benefiting those below as their aspiration and are able to announce to the duke and gain his compliance in relocation, so Four is also called ‘central path,’ meaning it aligns its conduct with Five’s centrality. Thus, those below who truly receive its benefit—Nine One’s great achievements—who would know that what the above bestows is not merely its resources but its capacity to benefit those below? Six Four’s merit in relocating the state—who would know that the above’s generous heart values not merely the person but the aspiration? Only when the aspiration is great does the person become great. Only when there are great persons does the aspiration attain great fulfillment. The noble person may thus discern where augmentation lies.”\n\n**Appendix**\nCheng Zhengshu says: “Announcing to the duke and gaining his compliance is achieved by announcing the aspiration to benefit those below. If the aspiration truly lies in benefiting those below, the above will surely trust and comply.”\n\n---\n\n**Guai (Decisiveness)**\n*Below Qian (Heaven), above Dui (Lake)*\n**Guai:** “Raising the matter in the royal court, trust in outcry, there is danger. Announcing from one’s domain, it is not beneficial to mobilize troops; it is beneficial to have somewhere to go.”\n\n**The *Tuan* says:** *Guai* means to decide, to have the firm decide the yielding. Vigorous yet joyful, resolute yet harmonious, raising the matter in the royal court—this is the yielding riding atop five firm lines. “Trust in outcry, there is danger”—its peril becomes its radiance. “Announcing from one’s domain, it is not beneficial to mobilize troops”—what it esteems reaches its limit. “Beneficial to have somewhere to go”—the growth of the firm will ultimately prevail.\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** The lake rises above heaven—this is *Guai*. The noble person thereby bestows emoluments upon those below and avoids complacency in virtue.\n\n**Nine One:** “Strength in the forward toes; going forth without victory brings blame.”\n**The *Xiang* says:** Going forth without victory—this is blame.\n\n**Nine Two:** “Alarmed outcry; in the night there are troops—do not worry.”\n**The *Xiang* says:** “In the night there are troops—do not worry”—this is attaining the central Dao.\n\n**Nine Three:** “Strength in the cheeks—there is misfortune. The noble person is resolute and forthright. Walking alone, he encounters rain; as if drenched, he is displeased—yet there is no blame.”\n**The *Xiang* says:** “The noble person is resolute and forthright”—in the end, there is no blame.\n\n**Nine Four:** “The buttocks lack flesh; its movement is halting. Leading a ram, regret vanishes—but hearing words, it does not trust.”\n**The *Xiang* says:** “Its movement is halting”—its position is not appropriate. “Hearing words, it does not trust”—its hearing is not enlightened.\n\n**Nine Five:** “The *xianlu* plant is resolute and forthright; the central path brings no blame.”\n**The *Xiang* says:** “The central path brings no blame”—the center has not yet radiated.\n\n**Upper Six:** “Excessive outcry—ultimately there is misfortune.”\n**The *Xiang* says:** “Excessive outcry brings misfortune”—it cannot endure for long.\n\n**Lake over Heaven: *Guai***\nFive yang lines decisively act below, while one yin line compliantly listens above—this is *Guai*. It speaks of the yielding and soft being unable to decide, relying on the five yang to resolve it, hence it is called *guai* (decisiveness). But how do we know it can resolve? Because this hexagram is vigorous yet able to be joyful. Thus, resolute yet able to harmonize: joyfulness gives rise to the aspiration for resonance, and its vigor can be enacted; harmony gives rise to the sincerity of the lake’s joy, and its resolution can penetrate.\n\nThe single yin above desires to resolve but cannot, while the five yang below cannot but resolve. For the five yang, this is truly difficult. With one yielding riding atop five firm lines, the five yang advance together and raise the matter in the royal court—this is the height of flourishing. “Trust in outcry, there is danger”—this refers to the correspondence between Upper Six and Nine Three. Dui is the mouth; Upper Six occupies the mouth’s position, having a mouth yet crying excessively—its yielding weakness is evident. If it were to cry out, it would surely do so first, prompting Nine Three to walk resolutely and forthrightly alone to meet it. How could Three fear the displeasure of the many yang? Yet it would bring peril and danger upon Upper Six. Why? If Upper Six could cry out to Three, Three would surely respond. Precisely its danger is what makes it radiant—this is the Dao of the ruler. Hence it is said: “Trust in outcry, there is danger; its peril becomes its radiance.” Alas, though it has a mouth and cries excessively, even if it sought peril, it could not attain it. Excessive outcry ultimately brings misfortune—how could it be merely peril and danger?",
      "overlap_context": "central path,” for Five occupies the center to augment below, and Four likewise aspires to augment below, aligning with the center in its conduct. Thus, the duke follows its announcement and may come to rely upon the state relocated by the initial Nine. Therefore, it is said: “Beneficial to rely upon for relocating the state.” Though Six Four is yin and soft, it truly augments its aspiration by following Five’s augmentation of those below—this is what it means to hold true with a generous heart.",

      "translated_text": "Its end cannot be prolonged—how could it be merely blame? From Nine Three’s case, one sees clearly that the five yang lines reveal Upper Six’s inadequacy for action. Thus, the Second, situated amidst the many yang, deems itself unfit for responsibility—why should it fear the warfare of dusk and night? The warfare of dusk and night is the theft of twilight. Yet since there is a master, the Second rests content in the center below. Though dusk and night bring warfare, it remains untroubled, vigilant only lest Upper Six’s outcry bring peril upon itself. Therefore, the sage praises its attainment of the central Dao. How could it resemble the reckless advance of the initial yang, unaware that its going cannot prevail and will only incur blame? That Nine Five is precisely the foremost figure extolled in the royal court—one who acts with centrality and incurs no blame, resolutely attending to affairs above, like Zhuge Liang or Jiang Wan. Even Zhuge Liang was hard to come by. Yet now, observing Nine Five’s centrality, which lacks radiance, one sees it falls far short of Zhuge Liang’s stature. Thus, Upper Six persists until the rigid and prolonged ultimately end—like Emperor Xian of Han meeting Cao Pi. One then understands that weak yin is difficult to support: even with the abilities of Yi Yin or the Duke of Zhou, *Guai* still requires the abilities of Tai Jia or King Cheng. The trustful outcry is the constant Dao of the noble person. I have indeed been moved by this resolute forthrightness.\n\nIt is said: “Announce within your own domain; it is not advantageous to resort to arms.” This speaks of the time when the five yang have gained ground and the earthly domain of *Kun* is nearly exhausted. One can only issue commands within one’s domain—who would raise arms? What is esteemed has reached its limit; even with five yang, what can be done? Yet it remains advantageous to have somewhere to go, for the five yang are all noble persons, not yet plotting usurpation. They merely await its natural end. Thus, the sage again clarifies the Dao of *Guai*’s decisive action in the six lines.\n\nThe First Nine, “vigorous in the forward toe,” incurs blame for going without prevailing—this is an excess of decisiveness, which must not be. The Second Nine, “untroubled,” knows the time and dares not act decisively—this is one who attains the center. The Third Nine, doubly rigid and vigorous, its decisiveness evident in its countenance, bears the image of vigor, yet in compliance. If vigor in the toe still brings blame, how much more perilous is vigor in compliance? Yet this Third, treading *Qian* while embracing *Dui*, stands precisely at the time of robust strength. Thus, the many yang respond to it, resenting or approving, and when it alone meets them, the two seem moistened—its yin and yang harmonious and moist, its vigor and joy following one another. Though resolute, it is not excessive—this is the noble person’s decisive action. Alas, Upper Six does not know to seek its alliance! Hence it is said: “The noble person decisively decisive.”\n\nAs for the Fourth, it is not that it does not wish to act decisively, but being yang in a yin position, it bears the image of excess and hesitation, unable to advance. Following the sheep from behind, it may perhaps avoid the regret of being led. Yet since it is not central or correct, it lacks clarity. Its following the sheep from behind, hindered by hesitation, is not due to hearing and believing, nor does it thereby avoid the regret of being led. Only Nine Five, closely approaching Upper Six with solitary yin above, can last but a short while. This is like tender amaranth treading upon hard ground—how could it not be resolute? Yet at this time, resolute though it may be, I know Nine Five cannot achieve greatness in central radiance. How difficult is Nine Three’s position! Nine Three, in correspondence, still shares the state’s concerns. Nine Five, bearing Upper Six, harbors the intent to await its inauspicious end. Alas, few ministers at such a juncture would not salivate. I hold that Yi Yin, the Duke of Zhou, and Lord Zhuge—these three great sages—are worthy of reverence.\n\n**Appendix**\nXiong Nansha says: *Kun* is the domain.",

      "translated_text": "When the five yin lines all transform, leaving only Upper Six, the domain of the land is diminished.\n\nFan Daxing says: Warfare requires multitudes. When *Kun* transforms to the fifth line, it nears the extremity of the multitude, hence \"not advantageous to engage in warfare.\"\n\nDing Yidong says: Four yang lines constitute \"strength,\" five yang lines constitute \"resoluteness.\" The initial line of *Great Strength* is called \"strength of the toe,\" thus it is distinguished by adding \"resolute\" to the preceding \"strength.\"\n\nZhai Xuan says: Before the head of *Qian* lies compliance.\n\n\"Solitary action\" refers to all lines being without correspondence, while only the third line corresponds with the uppermost, hence \"solitary.\"\n\nUpper Six is the master of *Completion of Joy*. Moreover, it ascends to the marsh of heaven, thus \"encountering rain.\"\n\nLi Tuweng says: The sage’s profound care for the Dao of yang is most earnest, hence the utmost warnings to those of yang firmness. From the first stirring of a single yang in *Return*, it is said: \"The day closes the gates, merchants and travelers do not proceed, the lord does not inspect the regions\"—all for protection and nurturance, lest it be harmed. The sage’s heart is thus revealed. When two yang lines show signs of gradual growth, the sage rejoices in their approach to the four yin, yet immediately says: \"As for the eighth month, there will be misfortune.\" While it is growing, he already considers its decline—this is not true haste in its dissipation. Only because he rejoices in its growth does he immediately contemplate its decline. Here again, the sage’s desire for its growth is most evident. When three yang lines form *Peace*, the flourishing of *Peace*’s exchange has been esteemed since antiquity—this goes without saying. At four yang lines, it becomes *Great Strength*. Yet while yang delights in strength, it utterly disdains the *use* of strength. For to use strength is the affair of petty men; the noble man dares not act thus. Hence it is said: \"The petty man uses strength; the noble man does not.\" If a noble man were to use strength, he would be but a ram—entangling his horns in the hedge, what gain is there in strength? If the strength of four yang lines is cautioned against so earnestly, how could the resoluteness of five yang lines be taken lightly? In all these five hexagrams, the sage’s deep love for yang is manifest. Those who possess the virtue of yang firmness should take care not to lightly employ their firmness, but rather strive to deeply embody the sage’s intent.\n\nBelow *Xun*, above *Qian*: *Gou* (*Encounter*). \"The woman is strong; do not take this woman.\"\n\nThe *Tuan* says: *Gou* means encounter—softness encounters firmness. \"Do not take this woman,\" for she cannot be partnered for long. When heaven and earth encounter, the beings of all things become manifest. When firmness encounters central correctness, great undertakings proceed throughout the world. The significance of *Gou*’s time is vast indeed!\n\nThe *Image* says: Wind beneath heaven—*Gou*. The lord thereby issues commands and proclaims to the four directions.\n\n**First Six:** Bound to a metal *ni*, steadfastness brings good fortune. To have somewhere to go—seeing misfortune, the emaciated pig struggles and hesitates.\nThe *Image* says: \"Bound to a metal *ni*,\" for the soft way is restrained.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** Enveloping the fish—no blame. Not advantageous for guests.\nThe *Image* says: \"Enveloping the fish\"—rightness does not extend to guests.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** The buttocks lack skin; its movement is halting and difficult. Danger—no great blame.\nThe *Image* says: \"Its movement is halting and difficult\"—its progress is not yet restrained.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Enveloping no fish—arising misfortune.\nThe *Image* says: \"Misfortune of no fish\"—distancing the people.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** With *qi* to envelop the melon, containing radiance—there is a falling from heaven.\nThe *Image* says: \"Nine in the Fifth containing radiance\"—central correctness. \"There is a falling from heaven\"—the will does not abandon the mandate.\n\n**Upper Nine:** Encountering its horns—regret, no blame.\nThe *Image* says: \"Encountering its horns\"—exhaustion above brings regret.\n\n**Heaven and Wind: Gou**—*Gou* means encounter. This hexagram, originally all yang, has a single yin beginning below, thus it is called \"encounter\"—softness encounters firmness, earth encounters heaven, the first six, a single yin, encounters five yang. When one soft and one firm encounter, they naturally form a pair; when above is heaven and below is earth, they naturally manifest all things. But here, a single yin encounters five yang—this woman is moreover strong—what is to be done? The sage says: *Xun* is the eldest daughter. The woman is already strong—do not take this woman. For if one does not take this woman, she cannot be partnered for long. Hence it is said: \"Do not take this woman, for she cannot be partnered for long.\"\n\nJin Shuxiang’s mother said: \"In deep mountains and great marshes, dragons and serpents are truly born. That beauty—I fear she will bear dragons and serpents to bring calamity to you.\" If so, is this woman not one who truly gives birth to dragons and serpents, bringing disaster to your state and misfortune to your house? That she cannot be taken is abundantly clear. Fortunately, there is the firmness of Nine in the Second—this woman encounters it like encountering a metal *ni*. Yet once encountered, she is bound and stopped, resolutely prevented from going further. The pig, the fish, and the melon are all yin things, all referring to the first line. Thus, at the first line, it is called the \"emaciated pig.\" \"Emaciated\" is like the \"emaciated horns\" entangled in the hedge—struggling and emaciated, desiring to go somewhere but not accepting restraint. How could it know that to have somewhere to go is to see misfortune, and that it must not be allowed to go anywhere? This is why being bound to the metal *ni* is steadfast and auspicious. Thus, at the second line, it again speaks of \"enveloping the fish.\" A fish must have water to live—how could enveloping it allow it to live? Yet Nine in the Second must envelop it to avoid blame. The fish is not advantageous for guests, hence rightness does not allow this fish to reach guests. Thus, it is better to envelop and confine it than to pass on misfortune. But how to account for Nine in the Fourth’s desire to \"arise misfortune\"? \"No fish\" means no misfortune. Yet Nine in the Fourth, taking itself as the guest of the first line, desires to \"arise misfortune\"—what can Nine in the Second do? Moreover, Nine in the Fourth occupies a position near the ruler, holding to the doctrine of proper correspondence. \"No fish\" gives rise to misfortune, distancing the people and provoking disputes. Though Nine in the Second is a metal *ni*, I fear it will ultimately be unable to restrain it. Thus, the reason Nine in the Fourth ultimately does not \"arise misfortune\"—is it not entirely due to the central correctness of Nine in the Fifth?",

      "translated_text": "Thus, at the Fifth Line, it speaks of \"enveloping the melon.\" Now, the melon is inherently a perishable thing; when enveloped, it perishes all the more readily. Yet Nine in the Fifth, being central and correct, uniquely embraces the splendid virtue of Nine in the Second, trusting in its central constancy. It then employs Nine in the Second’s *qi* to envelop the melon of Initial Six. Since the melon has already fallen from heaven, Nine in the Fourth is thus able to petition heaven and avoid arising misfortune—how profoundly auspicious! Heaven is *Qian*, the Fifth. Nine in the Second, by this means, preserves its firm righteousness; Nine in the Third, by this means, avoids being entangled in action; and the Top Line, by this means, though exhausted, encounters no misfortune and so remains free of blame. From this, we know that Nine in the Fifth’s resolve truly cannot contain the mandate of its kindred line to such an extent. Alas! When a ruler of central correctness and a minister of firm centrality meet and form a splendid union, it reaches this degree. Then is there anything under heaven that cannot be accomplished? Thus it is said: \"When the firm encounters the central and correct, great undertakings prevail throughout the world.\" The timeliness of *Sheng* is indeed momentous!\n\nNine in the Third, situated below *Qian* in the symbol of the buttocks, with *Xun* representing hesitation and indecision, and dwelling above *Xun* in the position of \"next and nearly,\" its symbol being \"next and nearly,\" thus its actions are not yet entangled with Initial Six and so it avoids great blame. Otherwise, how could danger be averted?\n\nHerein lies a difficulty: when the first *yin* arises, it is *Gou*; when the second *yin* gradually grows, it becomes *Dun*. *Dun* does not mean \"to flee\" but \"to restrain.\" Since the world cannot tolerate the primal *yin*, the firm and yang must not be idle. In *Dun*, though one spends the whole day amid filth, it is of no consequence. For the firm and yang are often intolerant, thus at the time when *yin* gradually grows, they are immediately restrained by *Dun*. Though *Dun* does not preclude encounter, even when encounter occurs, it is in truth *Dun*.\n\nWhen three *yin* lines form *Pi*, if three *yin* reside below, it is still *Pi*; yet when four *yin* reside below, it becomes *Guan*—why is this? For when two yang reside above and four *yin* below, the superior remains unmoved in countenance and naturally becomes the world’s spectacle—what then of two *yin* or three *yin*? Thus, when the sage is above and *yin* and *yang* harmonize, the world attains peace through this.\n\nYet the world’s particular concern is the absence of those who embody great observation. If there is truly great observation, one yang suffices—why wait for two? Those who advocate delay do so precisely because of the lack of great observation.\n\nWhen five *yin* lines erode and form *Bo*, one brings ruin upon oneself, losing all shelter. Thus, the sage deeply considers the multitude of *yin*, saying: one must repair one’s hut to take refuge and bear the ruler upon a carriage. For is not the great fruit here? Who would dare consume it? The sage’s guidance to humanity regarding the interplay of *yin* and *yang* is profound, and his strategies for *yang* are exhaustive. Readers should ponder this carefully.\n\n**Appendix**",
      "overlap_context": "desires to \"arise misfortune\"—what can Nine in the Second do?

Though Nine in the Second is a metal *ni*, I fear it will ultimately be unable to restrain it. Thus, the reason Nine in the Fourth ultimately does not \"arise misfortune\"—is it not entirely due to the central correctness of Nine in the Fifth?",

      "translated_text": "Firmly knowing that at Nine in the Fifth, one cannot avoid the vulgarity of *cui* in a position of power, nor the failure to demonstrate enduring constancy, nor the dimming of unfulfilled radiance. This is because one fears that the people of Initial Six may yet stir disorder to the end, hence the sigh of lament and the doubt of untrustworthiness. Such are the considerations by which the sage plans for the Fifth. It also reveals that one who would be ruler cannot but be upright, cannot but be great. *Yuan* (元) is greatness; *zhen* (贞) is uprightness. Thus enduring without cease. If, like Nine in the Fifth of *Bi* (比), one divines *yuan*, enduring constancy, and naturally becomes the one whom the five yin lines cherish and assist, then one may dispel regret and cause those who lack trust to trust, those who *cui* in positions of power to *cui* in virtue. This hexagram resembles *Bi*, so the sage uniquely considers *cui* at Nine in the Fifth, reiterating that only with the virtue of *yuan* and enduring constancy can regret be dispelled. Otherwise, *cui* will ultimately fall into chaos—how could regret be dispelled? As for Initial, Third, and Top, merely by advancing to *cui*, all avoid misfortune. As for Second and Fourth, not only do they avoid misfortune, but they also attain great fortune. How magnanimous are the sage’s plans for the people! There is no other reason. Constancy governs encounters with difficulty; the aspiration for radiance and greatness is hard to attain. To comprehend the sentiments of heaven, earth, and the myriad things is not something one meets in a single day or night. Second and Fourth understand this, so they can only draw each other to *cui*, not yet daring to demand perfection. If one must wait for a ruler like Yao or Shun before *cui*, then the scholar who would act upon his aspirations would never find the time. How could one not be magnanimous? Fourth and Fifth are both yang, but Nine in the Fifth holds position and is the one whom the multitude *cui*. Fourth does not occupy the position of Nine in the Fifth, yet turns to *cui* with Five—this is their difference. Alas! Fourth *cui* with Fifth and attains great fortune, yet what more is needed for Fifth, who is *cui* itself? This is the essence of *cui* in this hexagram.\n\nFang Shihua said: All *cui* gathers in one person. Nine in the Fifth occupies this position, and the first to *cui* in close alignment are the four yang lines of shared virtue. Thus, Nine in the Fourth alone is called \"great fortune,\" \"no misfortune,\" for Fourth possesses the substance to gather all under heaven, though it does not occupy the position. Nine in the Fifth rightfully holds the position, hence it is called \"*cui* in a position of power.\" Yet to speak only of position is to lack radiance. If not for the position, it would not suffice to *cui*. Wang Benhe said: Water clings to earth in *Bi*, establishing the myriad states and befriending the feudal lords—this is how one befriends. Through friendship, one compares; through comparison, friendship deepens. Who would say the sage’s comparison is not all-encompassing? Marsh gathers upon earth in *Cui*. Removing weapons of war and guarding against the unforeseen—this is how one secures *cui*. Through security, one gathers; through gathering, one reflects on security. Who would say the sage dares to forget peril? Alas, how perfect! Those who possess the world may reflect upon the origins of *bi* and *cui*.\n\n**Appendix**\nLiu Junbo said: *Zhai* (斋) and *zi* (咨) are sounds of *Dui* (兑), resembling tears flowing. *Dui* is the image of a marsh. Wang Ji said: Water gathers without restraint and bursts its banks; the multitude gathers without discipline and falls into chaos. *Chu* (除) means to cultivate and govern, removing evil and decay. Heaven generates the five materials, and the people discard none of them—who can abolish weapons? To abolish weapons is to invite chaos. The noble one removes weapons of war only to guard against the unforeseen—this is the meaning of \"securing without forgetting peril.\"\n\n**Below Xun, above Kun: Sheng (升): Great prosperity.**\nUseful for meeting the great person; do not worry. A southern campaign is auspicious.\n\n**The *Tuan* says:** The yielding ascends in due time; it is compliant and obedient. The firm is central and responsive—thus great prosperity. Useful for meeting the great person; do not worry, for there will be celebration. A southern campaign is auspicious, for the aspiration is fulfilled.\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** Within the earth, wood grows—this is *Sheng*. The noble one, in accordance with virtue, accumulates the small to become lofty and great.\n\n**Initial Six:** Trustworthy ascent; great fortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Trustworthy ascent; great fortune, for it aligns with the will above.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** Sincerity makes the offering of *yu* (擒) beneficial; no misfortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The sincerity of Nine in the Second brings joy.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** Ascending an empty city.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Ascending an empty city—there is no cause for doubt.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** The king offers sacrifice at Mount Qi; auspicious, no misfortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The king offers sacrifice at Mount Qi—this is obedience to duty.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Constancy is auspicious; ascending the steps.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Constancy is auspicious; ascending the steps—greatly fulfilling the aspiration.\n\n**Top Six:** Dark ascent; beneficial for unceasing constancy.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Dark ascent at the top—diminishing, not enriching.\n\n**Earth-Wind Sheng**\nFang Shihua said: When wood ascends, its initial substance is most yielding and fragile, yet it can rise from the earth to pierce the heavens. Even the hardest cannot do so in its obscurity, for it does not know that it is ascending. If it knew it was ascending, it could not ascend, and even if it did, it would not endure. Thus it is said: \"The yielding ascends in due time.\" How could this not be greatly prosperous? The hexagram’s image is obedient and compliant; the line images are firm, central, and responsive—this is the substance of great prosperity. Six in the Fifth is the great person of the hexagram. Second, with the virtue of firm centrality, responds to Five, so Second uses this to ascend and meet the great person. Having met the great person, what aspiration cannot be fulfilled? Why worry that others will not share in the celebration? Wood flourishes in summer, the season of the southern direction. To advance southward and meet the great person is to fulfill one’s aspiration among the people, bringing great celebration and prosperity—is this not fitting? The celebration is the joy of Second; the fulfillment of aspiration is the great satisfaction of Fifth. Each line ascends in due time, and none is inauspicious. Thus, in other hexagrams, extremes inevitably reverse, but in *Sheng*, there is no such reversal.",

      "translated_text": "Alone in this, it is precisely so.\n\nAt the outset, yielding below, it aligns its aspiration with the Fourth, thus justly ascending with great fortune—just as when firm centrality responds, it gains the favor of filial offering. This is why it is trustworthy, advantageous for selection and offering.\n\nWood emerges from the earth, fundamentally free of obstruction. This is why it ascends: the empty city and the virtue of compliance reside within, and when affairs are undertaken in due time, it ascends to the midst of heaven.\n\nThis is why it is favored: announcing enthronement at Mount Qi, with the great compliance of Six in the Fifth dwelling centrally—this is the time of the level steps of peace. Thus it is said: \"Correct and auspicious.\" Ascending the steps, one assumes the imperial throne and becomes the Son of Heaven.\n\nAt the topmost Six, ascent is obscured; being above, its ascent is unseen, ceaseless yet without visible constancy. Alas, it has reached the utmost! In its ascent, it pierces the clouds and parts the mist—how could the wood know this? For yin is insubstantial and not abundant, ever accustomed to deeming insufficiency as regret. Yet today’s ascent, though it reaches the heavens, remains self-unaware—this may be called dispelling the mind of insufficiency.\n\nThus, those who excel in ascent are like the wood’s suppleness: emerging from the earth, ascending in due time to become beams and ridgepoles, so that others rely on its blessing alone. Utterly unaware of rising from earth to heaven, its aspiration is fully realized, and all benefit from its presence. Compliant and yielding, it neither displays itself to things nor rejoices, nor contends with the times. Though one might wish otherwise, how could it fail to be greatly auspicious and free of blame?\n\n---\n\n**Appendix**\nZheng Kangcheng said: \"The earth is *kun*, the wood is *xun*; wood grows within the earth, daily lengthening and rising upward.\"\n\nMaster Xiang said: \"*Cui* has firm centrality above, so its multitude must gather and ascend. Firm centrality below ensures its ascent.\"\n\nXu of Jinzhai said: \"In *Jin*, the three yielding lines below share aspiration with the Fifth, so Six in the Third speaks of 'the multitude’s trust' and explains it as 'aspiration ascending.' The single yielding line below aligns with the Fourth, so the Initial Six speaks of 'just ascent' and explains it as 'aligning aspiration above.'\"\n\nWang Ji said: \"Wood grows within the earth, lengthening and ascending—this is the image of *Sheng*. Following its natural principle without imposing private intent is called *shun*. Complying with the wood’s growth, from the tiniest sprout to towering height, none see the limit of its ascent, for it achieves this through gradual accumulation. This is the meaning of 'journeying far from near' and 'ascending high from low.' The virtue of compliance is the image of the earth; accumulating small to reach great is the image of yielding wood.\"\n\n---\n\n**Kan below, Dui above**\n*Kun*: Prospering, correct; the great person is auspicious, without blame.

Advantageous for offering and sacrifice.\n**The Image** says: The nose and feet cut off—his aspiration is unfulfilled. Then slowly there is release, for he is central and upright. Advantageous for offering and sacrifice—receiving blessing.\n\n**Topmost Six**: Distressed by creeping vines and brittle twigs; saying, \"Move and repent,\" there is repentance—advancing is auspicious.\n**The Image** says: Distressed by creeping vines—not in its proper place. \"Move and repent,\" there is repentance—advancing is auspicious.\n\n---\n\nThe marsh’s water *Kun*: The firm *kan* is overlaid by the yielding *dui*, so the noble one is obscured by flattering, deceptive petty men, and the yang firmness is subdued by the craft of the perverse. Thus *Kun* is evident.\n\nYet the Fifth dwells in the body of joy, slowly finding release and preserving its central uprightness—this is peril below and joy above. Though distressed, it does not lose its prosperity. Why? Because of its correctness. Thus it is said: *Kun*: prospering, correct; the great person is auspicious, without blame.\n\nNine in the Second, firm, comes to dwell in the midst of *kan* peril—this is the great person. The nature of steadfast correctness does not lose itself in distress, so it does not fail to prosper. Auspicious and without blame—what doubt remains?\n\n*Kan* is wine, *dui* is food. Others see only the Second’s distress within confinement, unaware that it truly suffers within wine and food. Feasting and revelry continue as usual, oblivious to grievance. Thus the Fifth, though swayed by slander, repeatedly seeks to cut off its nose and feet, to distress it with the crimson knee-cover. Yet upon reflection, it finds release in the Second’s central uprightness, not believing the falsehoods of others. Thus the Second’s line says: \"The crimson knee-cover arrives; advantageous for offering and sacrifice.\" The Fifth’s line says: \"Advantageous for offering and sacrifice, receiving its blessing.\" The great person’s prosperity is all the more evident.\n\nThe Initial Six below, the image of buttocks, has the firm Nine in the Second as a withered tree before it. Dwelling at the bottom of *kan*, it enters the image of a dark valley, separated by three lines from encountering the Fourth—three years without hope. The First gazes toward the Fourth, three years like a single day, while the Fourth comes slowly, distressed by the Fifth’s metal chariot, unable to do otherwise.",

      "translated_text": "Though near at hand, it seems but regret—yet in the end, there is resolution. This is because the Fourth’s aspiration lies below, and the Initial is truly one who would join with it. Thus, though three years pass without hope, they must ultimately meet, ensuring no misfortune. The \"golden chariot\" is the chariot of the king. The \"crimson knee-cover\" and \"scarlet knee-cover\" are both used to adorn the chariot. The line *dui* represents metal, hence it is also called \"gold,\" \"crimson,\" and \"scarlet.\"\n\nNow, nothing is as hard and unyielding as stone, nor as sharp and piercing as the *xianhua* thorn. Here, the Six in the Third mounts the firm, its image like one trapped beneath solid rock, pressed atop thorns—truly confined, with no escape. Not only will the self be lost, but the household too shall perish. How can one hope to see one’s wife, or enter one’s palace? Such is the inauspicious calamity that befell the Nine Lords and the Earl of E.\n\nYet the Nine in the Second finds prosperity in adversity not merely by its own steadfastness, but by the gradual favor of the sagely and enlightened Heavenly King in the Fifth. When favor comes, slander is disbelieved, and those who wield words as weapons are brought to ruin. Looking back upon oneself, one finds the self entangled in creeping vines, unable to shield its roots; or trapped in brittle reeds, unable to find stability. Thus, facing the mouth of *dui* above, one speaks: \"In past actions, I truly repent.\" If one can truly repent, then misfortune turns to fortune, perversity to uprightness—how easily this may be! Would the great person, now embracing renewal, deign to contend with such a one?\n\nAh! This is what makes the great person great—this is how, even in adversity, they never fail to prosper, never fail to find good fortune, and remain without blame. If one truly possesses the steadfastness of the great person, what harm can adversity bring? This is no mere luck. Scholars must carefully ponder the phrase: \"confined by wine and food.\"\n\nMaster Fang Shihua asked: How can adversity lead to prosperity? Through peril tempered by joy. Thus, to be in adversity yet not lose one’s place is prosperity. Yet this is not possible for the ordinary person. The great person, dwelling in firmness and centeredness, does not covet what lies beyond. Though adversity may surround, how can it confine the center? With firmness, one remains unassailable, never sinking into adversity. How then can it become one’s own adversity? If it could, where would firmness reside?\n\nThus the sage said: Adversity is common to all. Yet the great person endures it in silence, as if untouched. Though in adversity, they never fail to prosper. If one laments, \"Why have I been brought to such extremity?\" or boasts, \"How could I fear this?\"—such is the path to misfortune, not the way of the great person’s good fortune and blamelessness.\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Zhaosou said: \"Three years without hope\" refers to passing through three lines from the Initial to the Fourth.\nWang Ji said: When water leaks downward, the marsh above dries—this is the image of exhaustion and adversity. *Dui*, with yin above, and *kan*, with yang below, represent the noble person oppressed by the petty, a time of hardship. \"Giving one’s life\" means surrendering it to others, no longer one’s own to command. \"Fulfilling one’s aspiration\" means realizing one’s good intentions without being swayed by misfortune.\n\n**Hexagram 48: The Well**\n*Xun* below *kan* above: The Well. The city may be changed, but the well cannot. There is no loss, no gain—people come and go, yet the well remains. Drawing near, one has not yet drawn from the well, but the jar is broken—misfortune.\n\n**The Judgment:**\n*Xun* enters water and raises it—this is the Well. The Well nourishes without end. The city may change, but the well does not—this is due to firmness and centeredness. Drawing near yet not drawing from the well means no merit has been achieved. The jar is broken—hence misfortune.\n\n**The Image:**\nWater above wood—this is the Well. The noble person encourages the people to labor and aid one another.\n\n**The Lines:**\n**Initial Six:** The well is muddy and undrinkable; an old well where no birds alight.\n**The Image:** The well is muddy and undrinkable—it lies too low. An old well where no birds alight—it is abandoned by the times.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** At the well’s hollow, one shoots at minnows; the jar is cracked and leaking.\n**The Image:** Shooting at minnows in the well’s hollow—there is no one to share with.\n\n**Nine in the Third:** The well is deep and undrinkable, causing sorrow in my heart. It may be drawn from; the king is enlightened, and all receive its blessing.\n**The Image:** The well is deep and undrinkable—one’s conduct is pitiful. Seeking the king’s enlightenment brings blessing.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** The well is tiled—no blame.\n**The Image:** Tiling the well brings no blame—this is repairing the well.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** The well’s waters are clear and cold, fit to drink.\n**The Image:** Drinking the cold spring’s waters—this is centeredness and correctness.\n\n**Top Six:** The well’s cover is not closed; with sincerity, there is great good fortune.\n**The Image:** Great good fortune at the top—this is great accomplishment.\n\nThe Well is the natural and inexhaustible source of nourishment. It has the power to sustain all things, but this depends on people drawing from it. If not drawn from, the well does not lose; if drawn from, the well does not gain. Those who come to draw—this well remains. Those who go without drawing—this well still remains. What remains is the well; those who come and go are people. Gain and loss belong to those who draw from the well—what does this have to do with the well itself?\n\nThus, the well may be drawn from but cannot compel people to draw—this is the virtue of *sheng*. Have you not seen how cities may change? Can the well be changed as well? The Nine in the Fifth dwells in the midst of *kan*, its firmness unchanging—truly like the well. Yet now, as one draws near the water, it has not yet been gathered, and the well’s pulley is already broken, the jar already cracked. What can be done? Though one draws daily, in truth, nothing is drawn.",

A leaking well with a broken jar—this is what is meant by \"worn and leaky.\"\nThe broken jar, like the muddy new well, cannot be drunk from; if left undrawn, it may still be abandoned.\nYet the Nine in the Third—here the well has been dredged, the spring made pure, yet it is not drunk from. Truly, this grieves my heart.\nWhy? It could be drawn from, yet one refuses to draw. The king’s lack of clarity is truly pitiable.\nIf the king were enlightened, he would surely draw and ascend, and those below would receive its blessing.\nThus the Master said: If a well is pure yet not drunk from, it does not merely grieve my heart—all who travel the Way see it and grieve.\nTherefore, to receive blessing, one must seek the king’s clarity.\nOtherwise, why would the king’s clarity be sought?\n\nThe Six in the Fourth is one who repairs the well—yet it is still not drunk from.\nThe Nine in the Fifth: the well is clear, and people drink from it.\nTruly, the cold spring is drinkable, sparing travelers from sorrow—without the king’s clarity above, how could this be achieved?\nThus, by the time we reach the Top Six, the well nourishes, and its bounty is inexhaustible.\nMorning and evening, one draws from it—do not cover it, do not seal it. Gather its jars, its pitchers; take as needed, and it will always suffice. This is because the Nine in the Fifth, centered and upright, possesses sincerity, and thus the blessing of the Top Six is supremely auspicious, bringing great completion above.\nIs this not what is meant by \"the enlightened king, and all receive its blessing\"? What need is there for the Five to seek it further?\n\nAlas! A single well—if left undrawn, it becomes a temporal abode, a broken jar, a cracked pitcher, causing all who see it to sigh in sorrow, yet none know how a single drawing could bring blessing.\nSuch is the unlabored kindness, the unasked-for grace. Let the king reflect and draw from it to attain clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Appendix**\nSu Zizhan said: *Chi* means dryness. To reach the well but not yet the water is called *chi*. To reach the water but not yet draw it from the well is called \"not yet having drawn the well.\"\nThe well itself never gains or loses; the merit of the well-pulley and the misfortune of the cracked pitcher lie with the one who draws.\n\nLiu Junbo said: *Shou* means to gather the pulley and pitcher—this is the completion of drawing. *Wu mu* means the mouth of the *kan* is not covered, making its benefit public. *You fu* means the reality within *kan* is sincere, deep and inexhaustible.\n\nXiong Guo said: The First Six, dwelling below without resonance, resembles a muddy well. The Nine in the Second, without resonance and below its neighbor, resembles a valley’s slope. The Nine in the Third, having completed the work of *xun* entering, thus speaks of \"dredging our well.\"\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram 49: Ge (Revolution)**\n*After the day of ji, there is sincerity.

When the words of revolution are thrice established, there is sincerity.\n**The Image:** *When the words of revolution are thrice established*—where else can one go?\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Regret vanishes. With sincerity, change the mandate—good fortune.\n**The Image:** *Good fortune in changing the mandate*—sincerity in purpose.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** The great person transforms like a tiger. Without divination, there is sincerity.\n**The Image:** *The great person transforms like a tiger*—their pattern is radiant.\n\n**Top Six:** The noble one transforms like a leopard; the petty person reforms their countenance. To advance brings misfortune; to dwell in constancy brings good fortune.\n**The Image:** *The noble one transforms like a leopard*—their pattern is lush. *The petty person reforms their countenance*—they follow the ruler in compliance.\n\n---\n\n**Marsh-Fire Revolution**\nThe revolutions of the times cannot be taken lightly—how much more so the great matter of transformation?\nShang Yang’s reforms were not without change, nor did they fail to swiftly strengthen Qin’s borders.\nYet after a year of implementation, thousands of Qin’s people spoke of its inconvenience, leading to punishments, the execution of its proponents, and the tearing apart of its architect—yet the people did not mourn. This was because the people’s hearts were not yet sincere, and he hastily sought revolution, startling them.\nIf the people are startled, who will trust him?\nThus it is said: *After the day of ji, there is sincerity*—only after revolution is there trust.\nTo say \"after the day of *ji*, there is sincerity\" means only after revolution is there trust. If one seeks revolution without sincerity, will the people not be startled?\nFor the people may be made to follow, but not to understand; they may be joined in celebrating success, but not in contemplating beginnings. Even the sage cannot but comply with this.\nOnly after compliance brings sincerity can revolution proceed. Once revolution is complete, sincerity naturally follows.\nSincerity lies not in the sage’s love of revolution, but in their recognition that revolution is unavoidable and fitting.\nHaving deliberated thoroughly and planned meticulously, there is supreme prosperity and advantage in constancy. When revolution is fitting, regret vanishes.\nPeople see only that the sage’s revolution is trusted by the people—how could they know the sage’s careful consideration of regret?\nRevolution truly begins and ends with this.\nThus all six lines speak of revolution, all speak of sincerity.\nThe First Nine, not yet sincere, does not dare to revolutionize. From the Six in the Second onward, revolution is complete, and the people are sincere.",

      "translated_text": "The First Nine, dwelling below, though in a time requiring revolution, does not dare speak of revolution, thus employing the firmness of an oxhide’s leather. Its revolution is steadfast, like the unyielding hide of a yellow ox, inherently resistant to action. If as immovable as oxhide, even in a time calling for revolution, who would perceive one’s capacity for change or recognize one’s desire to revolutionize?\n\nThe Six in the Second resides at the center of *Li*, embodying the image of the *ji* day. The *ji* day is the day when revolution becomes fitting. Revolutionizing on the *ji* day brings auspicious征 and no blame. To act with excellence is indeed what is meant by \"like a startled crow\" or \"swift as thunder that leaves no time to cover one’s ears.\" As the Second aligns with the Fifth, it speaks of \"excellence.\" Since the Second is already ripe for revolution, by the Third, the day of revolution arrives. With such sincerity, if not revolutionized, what else remains? Though it is said to be overly rigid, bearing warnings of inauspicious征 and perilous constancy, this too considers potential future regret, ensuring the revolution is fitting—thus, it is not that revolution is impossible.\n\nAs for the Fourth, precisely at the moment of transformation, with people’s trust and resolve firmly established, how could it not be auspicious? Since the Fourth speaks of \"having sincerity,\" the Fifth, even before divination, is already known to possess it. What else could this be but the great stabilization of a new order, the renewal of creation, when the great person transforms like a tiger and the world’s culture shines forth? For this is an act that aligns with Heaven and responds to the people, carrying out the revolution of the four seasons. Its time is the *ji* day, the moment when sincerity in revolution is trusted. Its revolution is one of cultural brilliance and joy, of great prosperity and rectitude. Thus, by the time of the Top Six, the Dao of revolution is fully accomplished. The noble person leads with ritual and music, adorned with the rich patterns of a leopard. The petty person turns their face in submission, bowing in obedience to their lord. If one were to seek further征, would it not be inauspicious? Abiding in constancy brings good fortune, for the primal force has acted and transformation is complete.\n\nThe hexagram’s image shows *Li* fire below and *Dui* marsh above. Fire can overcome water, extinguishing it; water can overcome fire, likewise extinguishing it. This is the mutual suppression of water and fire, a revolution ordained by the Dao of Heaven. Moreover, *Dui* as the youngest daughter resides above, while *Li* as the middle daughter resides below—young and elder in reversed positions, dwelling together yet at odds in will. This is a revolution required by human affairs. Thus, only the sage can align above with the Dao of Heaven and respond below to the hearts of the people, uniquely capable of revolutionizing fittingly. Hence it is said: *primordial prosperity, advantage in constancy, regret vanishes.*\n\nFrom this, it follows that the *ji* day is when sincerity is achieved. Once revolution is complete and the people trust it, what doubt remains?\n\n---\n\n**Appendix**\nZheng Kangcheng said: *Ge* (革) means governance. Water and fire suppress each other and alternate in dominance, hence it is called *ge* (revolution).\n\nWang Fusi said: The people may be accustomed to the familiar but struggle to adapt to change; they may delight in completion but falter at the outset. Thus, the Dao of revolution is not trusted at first but gains trust on the *ji* day.\n\nCai Zimu said: *Primordial prosperity, advantage, constancy*—these are the virtues of *Qian*. *Sui* (随) means following things, while *ge* (革) means transforming them. Things cannot be blindly followed, so only with *primordial prosperity, advantage, and constancy* can one avoid blame. Nor can they be recklessly transformed, so only with *primordial prosperity, advantage, and constancy* can regret vanish.\n\nYu Lingsheng said: *Gong* (巩) means firmness. *Li* represents the cow. At the beginning of *Ge*, one cannot act rashly, hence it is said: *firm, using the leather of a yellow ox.*\n\nLiu Changmin said: The Fifth is the master of revolution, where martial might is proclaimed and cultural virtue shines. \"Three revolutions\" refers to the threefold issuance of commands, their decrees already enacted. \"Changing the mandate\" in the Fourth means trust and resolve are complete, all things follow transformation. By the Fifth, there is great prosperity and rectitude without pretense; divination confirms its sincerity.\n\nChang Jichang said: The tiger’s transformation embodies awe-inspiring virtue, subduing enemies a thousand miles away. Its influence is such that all trust at a glance—like Shun dancing with feathered banners and the Miao submitting, or the Duke of Zhou cultivating cultural virtue and the people of Yuechang presenting pheasants. Thus it is said: *even before divination, there is sincerity.*\n\nWang Deqing said: The tiger’s patterns are refined and radiant, while the leopard’s are dense and lush.\n\nSu Shi said: The *Yi* speaks of wind following the tiger. The tiger possesses patterns and spiritual power, while the leopard has patterns but lacks spiritual power.\n\nYang Xiong said: The wildcat transforms into a leopard, the leopard into a tiger.\n\nWang Ji said: Water and fire suppress each other as *ge* (革). *Ge* means change. The greatest of changes are the four seasons. In the governance of emperors and kings, nothing precedes the granting of time. The noble person observes the image of change and revolution to regulate the calendar, clarifying the sequence of the four seasons, the paths of the sun, moon, and five planets, the alternation of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. By tracking the sun and moon and examining the central stars, one can determine the four seasons—thus, regulating the calendar clarifies time. The image of *yin* below and *li* above yields the method of calendar-making. The calendar must be reformed yearly; without reform, celestial measurements gradually drift. This is the method of annual precession. Establishing the calendar’s epoch is merely its overarching framework.\n\n---\n*Xun* below, *Li* above\n**Ding (鼎): Primordial Auspiciousness. Offering.**\nThe *Tuan* says: *Ding* is an image. Wood submitting to fire represents cooking. The sage cooks to offer to the Supreme Divinity and grandly cooks to nourish the sagely and worthy. Submissive yet perceptive in hearing and sight, advancing gently and ascending, attaining the center and responding to the firm—thus *primordial prosperity.*\n\nThe *Xiang* says: Fire above wood is *Ding.* The noble person rectifies their position and solidifies their mandate.\n\n**First Six:** The *ding* overturns its legs. Favorable to expel the impure. Gaining a concubine for her son brings no blame.\nThe *Xiang* says: The *ding* overturns its legs—this is not perverse. Favorable to expel the impure, to follow the noble.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** The *ding* has substance. My rival has illness; they cannot approach me. Auspicious.\nThe *Xiang* says: The *ding* has substance—prudence in where one goes.",
      "overlap_context": "lously, there is supreme prosperity and advantage in constancy. When revolution is fitting, regret vanishes.\nPeople see only that the sage’s revolution is trusted by the people—how could they know the sage’s careful consideration of regret?\nRevolution truly begins and ends with this.\nThus all six lines speak of revolution, all speak of sincerity.\nThe First Nine, not yet sincere, does not dare to revolutionize. From the Six in the Second onward, revolution is complete, and the people are sincere.",

      "translated_text": "My rival has illness—ultimately no fault.\n**Nine in the Third:** The *ding*’s ears are transformed; its movement is blocked. The pheasant’s rich broth goes uneaten.

The First Six represents the *ding*’s legs; the second, third, and fourth lines, all yang, represent its belly. The fifth, a single yin, represents its ears. The top, another yang, represents its beam. When wood enters fire, lifting the *ding* to cook—every household does this; what is there to speak of? Yet the sage, with a single cooking, offers to the Supreme Divinity, and with grand cooking nourishes the sagely and worthy. What is sagely? Submissive yet perceptive in hearing and sight. The Six in the Fifth, advancing gently and ascending, attaining the center and responding to the firmness of Nine in the Second—are these not the great sages and worthies? This is the cooking that nourishes the sagely and worthy. This, too, is the early offering to the Supreme Divinity. How is it supremely auspicious? How is it thoroughly prosperous? Thus this hexagram alone combines *supreme auspiciousness*, *great auspiciousness*, and *prosperity*.\n\nThe sage points to the Top Nine’s jade beam. The sagely and worthy refer to the Six in the Fifth, centered to serve as substance with yellow ears, threaded by the golden beam to be lifted. Nine in the Second, “the *ding* has substance,” is the vessel for nourishing the sagely and worthy. Though the third and fourth are also the *ding*’s substance, the third’s ears are transformed and cannot be lifted, while the fourth spills the stew and breaks its legs—thus only the second truly has the *ding*’s substance and can be used to nourish the sagely and worthy. The First Six, below as the *ding*’s legs, overturns its legs to expel the impure. Overturning the legs is contrary to the Way, yet it is said to be “not perverse” because it is favorable to expel the impure and follow the noble. “Gaining a concubine” is the image of expelling the impure; “for her son” is the image of following the noble, hence “no blame.”\n\nNine in the Second, firm and centered, has substance in the *ding*’s belly. Looking up at the third and fourth, they are truly my rivals. Yet the third’s ears are transformed, and the fourth spills the stew—they have illness and cannot approach me. Thus I cannot but offer my substance to the Fifth. If others shared the same substance, there would be reliance. Now only the second remains—how can one not be prudent? Without prudence, how could the supreme sage offer to the Supreme Divinity and nourish the sagely and worthy? The third stands at the time of transformation; its ears are altered and it cannot move, so the pheasant’s rich broth from the clinging fire goes uneaten. As the Top Nine’s rain just begins, regret from deficiency in response diminishes—yet what is lost is the *ding*’s nourishing function, while what remains is the vessel for nourishment. With the jade beam above, the ears will ultimately be lifted—hence “ultimately auspicious.” As for the fourth, the *ding*’s belly is already full, its legs break, and the stew is spilled, its form befouled and unusable. How can it be otherwise? The “centered to serve as substance” is the emptiness within *li*. What the *ding*’s substance relies on to be lifted lies entirely in this clarity of the center. This is called “centered to serve as substance,” hence “the *ding* has yellow ears.” The “golden beam” speaks of its ability to lift this substance: the Six in the Fifth, centered and yellow, serves as the ears, and uses yellow gold as the beam. Yellow is the color of the center, like gold. The image of lifting the ears must include the beam—there is no lifting the ears without the beam. Thus the Fifth combines “yellow ears” and “golden beam.” This is the steadfastness of the sagely and worthy, hence “favorable to be steadfast.”\n\nAs for the Top Nine, the *ding*’s substance is already lifted, supremely using the beam at the *ding*’s proper place. Thus it is named by its virtue of the jade beam, saying that the second and fifth, hard and soft, respond in moderation: the golden beam lifts, and the *ding*’s substance is consumed. The Top Nine’s jade beam is truly the supreme accomplishment of transformation. It is fitting that “greatly auspicious, supremely without harm” belong to it. “Greatly auspicious” is supreme auspiciousness; “without harm” is supreme auspiciousness and prosperity. The *Ding*’s supreme auspiciousness and prosperity—if this were merely about the mouth, as in *Yi*, what would there be to mention? Yet to the sage, nourishing the worthy extends to all the people—this is the *ding*’s cooking. In essence, there is no great matter, yet to the sage, nourishing the sagely and worthy is to offer to the Supreme Divinity.\n\nLiu Yongxiang says: If *Yi* were only about the mouth and *Ding* only about the belly, what would there be to observe in what is cooked and nourished? Ma Fengyang says: The sage cooks to offer to the Supreme Divinity, and grandly cooks to nourish the sagely and worthy. If one cannot grandly cook to nourish the sagely and worthy, then even if one wishes to offer to the Supreme Divinity, the Supreme Divinity will not accept it. Thus offering to the Supreme is called “cooking,” while nourishing the sagely and worthy is called “grand cooking.” How insignificant are the sagely and worthy in the world! Today one dies unused; tomorrow another dies unseen in their lifetime—how lamentable the *ding*! I know not what the cooking and nourishing are for.\n\n**Appendix**",

The *ding*’s capacity reaches its limit at four; beyond that are the ears. To receive contents, there must be surplus capacity to allow for overflow; at four, it overflows and topples. Shao Guoxian says: “Five in the *ding* are the ears.” The ears are what admit the crossbar to lift it. “Above in the *ding* is the crossbar.” The crossbar is what threads through the ears to lift the *ding*. Yang Jian says: “Nothing transforms things like the *ding*. Tang and Wu’s revolution was truly mandated by Heaven. When Heaven commands the noble person to rectify their position, how can the noble person fail to rectify their position? Yet Heaven’s mandate cannot be relied upon.

      "translated_text": "When the thunder comes with trembling dread, laughter and speech return in cheerful tones. The thunderclap resounds for a hundred *li*, yet the sacrificial ladle is not lost.\n\n*The Judgment* says: Thunder brings offering. When the thunder comes with trembling dread, fear brings forth blessing. Laughter and speech return in cheerful tones, for afterward there is a model to follow. The thunderclap resounds for a hundred *li*, startling the distant and alarming the near. Thus one may go forth to guard the ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain, serving as the master of sacrifice.\n\n*The Image* says: Repeated thunder is *Shock*. The noble person, in fear and trembling, engages in self-cultivation and reflection.\n\n**First Nine:** When the thunder comes with trembling dread, afterward laughter and speech return in cheerful tones—auspicious.\n*The Image* says: When the thunder comes with trembling dread, fear brings forth blessing. Laughter and speech return in cheerful tones, for afterward there is a model to follow.\n\n**Six in the Second:** The thunder comes perilously; a fortune in cowries is lost. Ascending to the ninefold hills, do not pursue—within seven days it will be regained.\n*The Image* says: When the thunder comes perilously, it is because one rides over the firm.\n\n**Six in the Third:** The thunder stirs restlessly; moving in shock, there is no blame.\n*The Image* says: The thunder stirs restlessly, for the position is not appropriate.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** The thunder sinks into the mire.\n*The Image* says: The thunder sinks into the mire, for its light has not yet shone.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** The thunder comes and goes perilously; a great fortune is lost, and there is activity.\n*The Image* says: The thunder comes and goes perilously, for one moves in danger. The matter lies in the center—great indeed is the loss.\n\n**Top Six:** The thunder trembles ceaselessly; one’s gaze is fixed and wandering, and to advance is ominous. The shock does not strike one’s own person but one’s neighbor—there is no blame. Yet in marriage alliances, there are words of reproach.\n*The Image* says: The thunder trembles ceaselessly, for the center has not been attained. Though ominous, there is no blame, for one fears the neighbor’s warning.\n\nThunder is the eldest son, the master of arousal. When the thunder comes and one is thus filled with dread and unease, it is because one fears that what brings forth blessing may not accord with the will of the Supreme. Therefore, one is startled into reflection, dare not rest at ease, and instead strengthens self-trust and self-cultivation. Then laughter and speech return in cheerful tones, saying: “From now on, I shall follow the seasons of Heaven and act without the slightest deviation from the Supreme’s model.”\n\nA single thunderclap startles the distant and alarms the near. If the lord of a hundred-*li* domain truly engages in fear and trembling, self-cultivation, and reflection, then the reach of his virtue and awe will extend for a hundred *li*, and it is fitting that his sacrificial ladle not be lost. Thus, as the eldest son, how could he not be the master of the ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain? How could there be no offering?\n\nIn ancient times, when the lord departed, the heir would guard the altars of soil and grain and serve as the master of sacrifice for the ancestral temples. Hence it is said that he may serve as the master of sacrifice.\n\nThe first line is the master of the completed *Shock*, so its words match the hexagram’s words, and its *Image* also matches the *Great Image*.\n\nSix in the Second rides over the firm, directly facing the coming thunder. Its peril and unease are extreme, and thus it suffers great loss of what it has long treasured. If it ascends to the ninefold hills, it becomes as the empty sky. No longer does it chase after the realm of appearances or the domain of thought. Thus, after seven days, the shock subsides, and it regains itself.\n\nFor Six in the Third, the lower shock is ending while the upper shock is beginning—its image is that of restless stirring. *Su* means revival. Six in the Third inwardly revives its resolve, reflecting and examining its conduct, knowing that its inner actions are of utmost importance. It guards against the slightest misstep.\n\nNine in the Fourth dwells in the time of doubled thunder, its heart filled with nothing but shock and dread. Yet the essence of shock lies in retreat and reflection. If one remains mired in fear without knowing to retreat and reflect, how can one ever expand and illuminate?\n\nSix in the Fifth experiences shock upon shock—not merely the coming of thunder. Six in the Second says “the thunder comes perilously,” for it rides over the firm and is thus in danger. Now Six in the Fifth says “the thunder comes and goes perilously,” for it moves in danger both coming and going. Yet Six in the Fifth, though it hears nothing, instead loses what it possesses in great measure. How could this be in a time without shock? Six in the Second, facing peril, lost what it treasured, thus losing what it fundamentally possessed—only afterward did it regain itself. This was the power of a single shock. Though Six in the Fifth moves in peril coming and going, it instead loses what it possesses in great measure because what it fundamentally possesses cannot be gained or lost by shock. This is what shock cannot shake. Ah, how perfect!\n\nYet if one does not move in the midst of peril coming and going, how can one test the depth of one’s learning and confirm that one cannot be moved to such an extent?\n\nThe Top Six dwells at the peak of shock, neighboring the Fifth. The Fifth is neither gained nor lost by shock, for it is beyond shock. Yet the Top Six is far from shock. The shock does not strike its own person but instead trembles ceaselessly, inwardly searching its heart and finding it empty, outwardly observing its conduct and finding nothing within—why then does it vainly pursue externals? Its ominousness is clear. Fortunately, it is close to Six in the Fifth and can trust in its neighbor’s great loss and activity. Thus, fearing the neighbor’s warning and hoping to share in its merit, it may yet avoid blame and escape misfortune.\n\nIf Six in the Third, in marriage alliances, reproaches it, saying: “You abandon your trembling, forget your shocked conduct, forsake your emptiness, and neglect your utmost importance—no longer will I join you in affairs,” it need not be concerned. One may know the thoroughness of the learning of the Way.\n\nThose below do not arouse without shock; those above do not cease without shock. Thus, in the aftermath of a single shock, each may lose something, each may arouse something, each may gain something, each may cease something—this is not comparable to other hexagrams.\n\nAh! When thunder crashes like swift lightning, all under Heaven are unsettled. The rebellious are executed, the unfilial are punished, and how could the lord who cultivates the Dao, the eldest son, fail to bring forth blessing?",

      "translated_text": "The *Xiang* says: \"*Gen* means stopping. Stop when it is time to stop, move when it is time to move—neither action nor stillness loses its proper moment, and thus the Dao shines brightly. 'Restraining the stop' means stopping where it should be stopped. Above and below oppose each other, with no mutual response; this is why 'one does not grasp the whole body.' Walking in the courtyard and not seeing its people—this incurs no blame.\"\n\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Two mountains together—this is *Gen*. The noble person reflects and does not overstep his position.\"\n\n**First Six:** \"Restraining the toes—no blame. Favorable for eternal steadfastness.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Restraining the toes—this is not losing correctness.\"\n\n**Six in the Second:** \"Restraining the calves, unable to lift what follows—his heart is not at ease.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Unable to lift what follows—this is not yielding to retreat.\"\n\n**Nine in the Third:** \"Restraining the waist, splitting the spine—danger scorches the heart.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Restraining the waist—danger scorches the heart.\"\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** \"Restraining the body—no blame.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Restraining the body—stopping at the self.\"\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** \"Restraining the jaws, words in proper order—regret vanishes.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"Restraining the jaws—this is central correctness.\"\n\n**Top Nine:** \"Reverent restraint—auspicious.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"The auspiciousness of reverent restraint—this is ending with thickness.\"\n\n*Gen* is the mountain. The two hexagrams *Zhen* and *Gen*—these are the great matters of the sage’s Dao of inquiry and learning. For all who engage in learning: as learning and inquiry grow daily more vast, what one hears and sees grows daily broader; as what one hears and sees grows broader, principles accumulate daily; as principles accumulate, cherishing them grows daily deeper. Day by day, accumulation deepens, and month by month, obstructions harden. Even the heroic and outstanding cannot free themselves—this is precisely what is called the deep pit of profit and desire, the snare that kills. Even if a sage dwelled among them, there would be nothing he could do. Yet they do not know that learning values knowing when to stop—stopping must have its place. Thus *Gen* takes the back as the place to stop, defining 'not grasping the body' and 'not seeing people' as the back. Stopping of itself where there is no place to stop—this is the perfect stop, the stop that knows where to stop. If even a thread of impurity remains, it is not the stop of the back. Thus from the toes upward, the five lines are all stops, but not of the back—they are not true stops.\n\n*Gen* of the toes is the learning of taking even a single step. *Gen* of the calves is the learning of wishing to stop but resenting the inability to stop—this is what one may hope for. *Gen* of the waist is restraining at the point of movement, forcibly demanding stillness—this is Gaozi’s learning of forcibly controlling the mind, with whom one can never speak. *Gen* of the body is disciplining the self. *Gen* of the jaws is being cautious in speech. These are all *Gen*, but they are not the difficult *Gen* to speak of. Without *Gen*, one cannot speak of learning, and thus the text concludes with \"reverent restraint.\" Yet the true learning of the world is not merely stopping. Stopping leads to stability, stability to stillness, stillness to peace—one can then reflect like a mirror, resonate like a struck bell, achieve balance, and govern the world while transcending it.\n\nHowever, if one is not roused by thunder to the point of losing life and fate, losing countless treasures, or losing great affairs, it is not easy to cleanse and suddenly stop. Fang Shihua says: \"The First Six, at the place of the toes, is able to restrain and stop—its freedom from blame is evident. For good fortune, misfortune, regret, and remorse all arise from moving the toes and then stopping; not moving would incur blame. Yet what is valued is 'favorable for eternal steadfastness.' How can one remain forever unmoving? Thus it says: 'no blame, favorable for eternal steadfastness.' If one can be eternally steadfast, then even movement incurs no blame.\"\n\nThe Master says: \"Stopping is difficult for people. But if one can restrain and stop, one naturally does not lose correctness. Perhaps through stopping one may even attain the place to stop—who can say? The world has never seen one who loves movement and does not stop who can stop where he should stop. This is why the images of the lines mutually elucidate one another.\"\n\nThe Six in the Second is at the place of the calves. The calves do not move on their own—this images the second line’s stopping of the calves, which cannot but follow the feet in movement, imaging the second line’s failure to find its place to stop. The calves, by nature, do not wish to move. Yet when they follow the feet in movement and have no means to lift them, this is why the Six in the Second is always ill at ease and resents its inability to subdue its own heart. Thus it says: \"not yielding to retreat.\" Yet the aspiration of the Six in the Second is truly pitiable.\n\n**Appendix**\nYang Jian says: \"One who stops well stops while walking the good path. One who knows where to stop but does not walk does not truly know where to stop. One who knows walking but does not know stopping does not truly know walking. Knowing that neither walking nor stopping is wrong, yet unable to unify the two—if both are timely, it is still not the bright Dao. Only when the four seasons alternate in their courses, when the sun and moon take turns shining, is there brightness—only then is the Dao of the *Yi* attained.\n\nA person’s spirit is entirely in the face, not in the back; entirely in the front, not in the rear. Thus the sage teaches 'restraining the back,' so that what the face turns toward, what the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet do, all follow the back. Then, though the applications intersect and the myriad affairs swarm, all is ultimately still. Seeing, hearing, speaking, moving, and the twists and turns of thought are like the transformations of heaven and earth. Only this is *Gen*, only this is stopping. If one restrains the face, though one stops, it is still movement. Knowing it moves and forcibly stopping it—it will never stop. Only by restraining the back does the face become like the back, the front like the rear, movement like stillness. Serene and without self, 'one does not grasp the body.' Though walking in the courtyard and interacting with people, one truly does not see them. Stopping where it should be stopped—this is stopping without a place, stopping without stopping. It is not stopping because one desires to stop, nor forcibly stopping what is not by nature still.\"",

      "translated_text": "Fundamentally, there is stopping; fundamentally, there is a place. Now, to speak of \"stopping where it should be stopped\" is to stop at the fundamental place. Without a place, there is no stopping. Stopping without stopping—this is true stopping. This is what is meant by \"stopping where it should be stopped.\" If there is a self, then there is a place.\n\nXiong Guo says: According to ancient script, the character for \"back\" (背) is written as \"north\" (北), or sometimes as \"stop\" (止). Master Zui states that following the hexagram’s text, \"back\" is correct. Wang Ji says: Two thunder, two wind, two fire, two water, two marsh—all imply the meaning of going and coming. Only two mountains stand in mutual opposition, not going or coming to each other; thus, this is stopping. The office of the heart is thought; thought that does not transgress its position is called correct thought. Like water in a mirror, it responds to things yet remains constantly still. Like the sun and moon, their steadfast brightness transforms and acts, illuminating the myriad things yet never moving. When the function of the thinking heart clings to non-thought, it becomes sunk in emptiness. When it clings to thought, it becomes ensnared by things. Non-thought without non-understanding—this is the lost learning of a thousand sages.\n\nFormer scholars spoke of \"not transgressing one’s position\" as in \"one who is accustomed to wealth and honor acts within wealth and honor, one accustomed to poverty and lowliness acts within poverty and lowliness,\" focusing solely on responding to the near at hand, yet failing to clarify the fundamental purport of thought. However, \"thought that does not transgress its position\" is precisely the meaning of \"not desiring what is external.\" Heart and the near at hand are not divided into two separate matters. *Gen* means stopping. \"Stopping at the back\" is stopping where it should be stopped. The functions of the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and the four limbs all manifest in the face. Only the back does not move; thus, it is taken as the image. Though the back does not move, the five viscera all press against it; the nourishment of the nine orifices and the hundred bones is conveyed through the back. Thus, it is the function of non-function.\n\n*Yiyin*, Lower Canon, Scroll Two, ends here.\n(Variants: #1 \"de\" [德] in the Jigu Pavilion edition; #2 \"or\" [或] as \"I\" [我]; #3 \"resent me\" [愠我] as \"I resent\" [我愠]; #4 \"trusting cry has danger\" [孚号有厉] originally missing, now supplemented according to the Jigu Pavilion edition; #5 \"center\" [央] as \"end\" [夬]; #6 \"follow its constancy\" [道其常] as \"encounter its changes\" [遭其变]; #7 \"all\" [咸] as \"complete\" [成]; #8 \"woman\" [女] as \"you\" [汝]; #9 \"lead\" [牵] as \"bind\" [系]; #10 this sentence as \"thus alone contains the beauty of one’s own chapter, serving the firm center of the nine twos\"; #11 \"cannot\" [不能] as \"can\" [能不]; #12 the Jigu Pavilion edition omits one \"chapter\" [章] character here; #13 \"beneficial to have somewhere to go, following Heaven’s mandate\" [利有攸往，顺天命也] originally \"beneficial to have somewhere, following the great mandate\" [利有攸者，顺大命也], now corrected according to the standard *Zhouyi*; #14 after \"with\" [以], the Jigu Pavilion edition omits \"as\" [为], now supplemented; #15 after \"one line ascends\" [一爻升], likely missing \"then\" [即]; #16 originally \"great\" [大], the Jigu Pavilion edition has \"wood\" [木], now corrected accordingly; #17 \"preserve and not incur misfortune\" [保不致凶] as \"thus not tied to misfortune\" [故不系以凶也]; #18 \"origin\" [元] likely \"without\" [无]; #19 \"marsh fire revolution\" [泽火革] originally \"marsh water revolution\" [泽水革], corrected according to context; #20 \"use\" [用] originally \"solid\" [固], corrected according to context and the Jigu Pavilion edition; #21 \"day\" [日] originally \"and\" [而], corrected according to the Jigu Pavilion edition; #22 \"image\" [象] originally \"elephant\" [象], corrected according to context; #23 \"offer\" [享] originally \"prosper\" [亨], corrected according to the standard *Zhouyi* and context; #24 after \"image\" [象], the Jigu Pavilion edition omits \"ding\" [鼎], now supplemented; #25 this sentence originally \"exiting negativity obtains concubine image, following nobility with child image, thus without blame\" [出否得妾象，从贵以子象，故无咎], now corrected according to the Jigu Pavilion edition; #26 \"verify\" [验] originally \"horse\" [马], corrected according to the Jigu Pavilion edition.)\n\n*Yiyin*, Lower Canon, Scroll Three\n*Gen* below, *Xun* above",

      "translated_text": "**Gradual Progress (Jian)**\n*Marriage of a woman is auspicious; perseverance in rectitude is favorable.*\n\n**The Judgment (Tuan):**\nGradual progress means the woman’s marriage is auspicious. Advancing to attain position brings merit in one’s undertakings. Progress through rectitude can rectify the state. Her position is firm, with the yang attaining the center. Stillness combined with compliance ensures movement is not exhausted.\n\n**The Image (Xiang):**\nBeneath the mountain grows a tree—this is *Gradual Progress*. The noble person abides in virtuous power and refines customs.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Six:**\nThe wild goose gradually advances to the shore.\nA youth is in peril; there is talk, but no blame.\n**The Image:**\nThe peril of the youth is blameless in principle.\n\n**Six in the Second Place:**\nThe wild goose gradually advances to the sandbar.\nFeasting with joy—auspicious.\n**The Image:**\nFeasting with joy is not mere idle satiety.\n\n**Nine in the Third Place:**\nThe wild goose gradually advances to the highland.\nThe husband goes forth and does not return; the wife conceives but does not bear—ominous.\nFavorable for warding off raiders.\n**The Image:**\nThe husband goes forth and does not return—he parts from the flock.\nThe wife conceives but does not bear—she loses the Way.\nFavorable for warding off raiders—compliance ensures mutual protection.\n\n**Six in the Fourth Place:**\nThe wild goose gradually advances to the tree.\nPerhaps it finds a perch—no blame.\n**The Image:**\nPerhaps it finds a perch—compliance and submission prevail.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth Place:**\nThe wild goose gradually advances to the hill.\nThe wife does not conceive for three years, yet none can overcome her—auspicious.\n**The Image:**\nNone can overcome her—auspicious, for she attains her desire.\n\n**Top Nine:**\nThe wild goose gradually advances to the highland.\nIts feathers may be used for ceremonial adornment—auspicious.\n**The Image:**\nIts feathers may be used for ceremonial adornment—auspicious, for they cannot be disordered.\n\n**Wind over Mountain: Gradual Progress**\nFang Shihua says: *Influence (Xian)* and *Gradual Progress* both concern the union of man and woman. Yet *Influence* means mutual resonance—a matter of great significance in learning and inquiry. Thus, though it takes the marriage of a woman as its theme, it does not speak solely of marriage. *Gradual Progress*, however, addresses it directly.\n\nThe initial stage of a woman’s marriage is like the first line. The second and fifth lines represent the proper course of a woman’s marriage. The third and fourth lines represent its expedient adaptations. The top line embodies the constancy of a woman’s chastity.\n\nWhen a woman is about to marry, she is like a wild goose leaving the water—hence the reference to the shore. Marriage is not yet complete, so she is called a \"youth.\" A young woman, newly betrothed, must leave her parents and brothers, feeling uneasy and anxious—hence the terms \"peril\" and \"talk.\" This is the natural state of a woman; how could it be blameworthy in principle?\n\nThe sandbar is a stone in the water. To advance there and feast with ease, self-reliant and unperturbed, is like the steadfastness of Meng Guang. Such a woman does not merely seek satiety—hence the auspiciousness.\n\nThe fifth line’s advance to the hill is not unstable, but she refuses to settle rashly. Though she does not conceive for three years, she is not barren—she refuses to bear children through a hasty match. Yet none can overcome her, for she either chooses a single partner without remarrying or rejects many suitors before finally fulfilling her wish—like Liang Hong. This is the proper course of a woman’s marriage, embodied in the second and fifth lines.\n\nThe third line has no proper correlate. With whom can it pair? The wild goose advancing to the highland is a sign of instability. Separated from its kind, it rises alone among two yin lines. The husband’s failure to return is not by choice; forced to accept the fourth line, he dares not openly raise a child. The wife’s failure to bear is ominous. Yet a lone woman without support cannot form a union. Who, then, wards off raiders?\n\nThe fourth line is also uneasy. If the wild goose advances to a tree, is that a proper perch? Its compliance and submission arise from necessity, having no proper correlate or support. A woman without support faces grave peril. If she finds a perch, she may avoid blame. This describes the third and fourth lines forming a union through mutual proximity—the expedient adaptation of a woman’s marriage.\n\nAlas! If a wild goose loses its mate, it will never pair again. Flying alone, it cries out sharply—so unyielding that its feathers may be used for ceremonial adornment. Like the third line, it has no proper correlate and is unstable, hence the shared image of the highland.\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Fusi says: Advancing to the highland and aligning with the fourth line means it cannot return. The husband does not return—does he delight in depravity? If he takes a wife, she cannot uphold chastity. Conceiving by another, she cannot bear—this is the path of misfortune. The third line, originally of the *Gen* trigram, abandons its flock and aligns with the fourth, never returning. This leads the wife to conceive but not bear—a path of misfortune. Yet when different natures unite in harmony, compliance ensures mutual protection, and none can intervene—hence the favor in warding off raiders.\n\nXiong Guo says: The fourth line, of the *Xun* trigram, is the remnant of wood—hence the wild goose advancing to a tree may find a perch. Li Dingzuo notes: The fourth line occupies a yin position, fitting the image of a perch.\n\nMaster Yu says: The fifth and second lines correspond—this is the proper union of husband and wife, hence auspicious. The third and fourth lines are adjacent—this is an improper match, hence ominous.\n\n**Marrying Maiden (Guimei)**\n*Advancing brings misfortune; nothing is favorable.*\n\n**The Judgment (Tuan):**\n*Marrying Maiden* embodies the great principle of Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth do not unite, the myriad things cannot flourish. *Marrying Maiden* marks the beginning and end of human life. Joy in movement—this is the marriage of a maiden. Advancing brings misfortune, for positions are not proper. Nothing is favorable, for the yielding rides upon the firm.\n\n**The Image (Xiang):**\nThunder over the marsh—this is *Marrying Maiden*. The noble person, understanding decay, ensures lasting fulfillment.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Nine:**\nThe marrying maiden serves as a concubine.\nThough lame, she can walk—advancing is auspicious.\n**The Image:**\nThe marrying maiden serves as a concubine—this is the norm.\nThough lame, she can walk—auspicious in mutual support.\n\n**Nine in the Second Place:**\nThough blind in one eye, she can see—favorable for the chastity of a reclusive person.\n**The Image:**\nFavorable for the chastity of a reclusive person—she has not altered her constancy.\n\n**Six in the Third Place:**\nThe marrying maiden waits, then returns as a concubine.\n**The Image:**\nThe marrying maiden waits—her position is not proper.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth Place:**\nThe marrying maiden delays her wedding; her return awaits the proper time.",

      "translated_text": "The *Thunder-Fire Feng* Hexagram: Fang Shihua’s Commentary\n\nFeng means greatness. When the grand yang illumines the heavens, all beings stir into motion—thus its greatness is evident. Yet if dusk approaches, all motion ceases. How then can its greatness be perceived? This greatness—who makes it so? The king makes it so. The king, turning toward brightness to govern, esteems greatness; hence it is said, \"the king attains it.\" *Jia* means greatness. The king values greatness, yet in this hexagram, the radiance of *Li* lies below while the movement of *Zhen* thunders above. *Li* below is not merely past its zenith—it nears dusk. *Zhen* above not only obscures the sun at noon—it brings dark clouds and gloomy rain. One fears the lack of brightness—how can there be greatness? Yet the sun at noon will reverse its course, and once reversed, it must return to midday. Thunder’s movement brings only darkness, but when it passes, brightness must return. Though *Li*’s radiance now lies below, the sun will naturally reach its zenith again. Though *Zhen*’s thunder now rolls above, the sun will naturally illuminate all under heaven once more. Why fear the sun’s failure to reach midday or the world’s lack of illumination? Thus it is said: \"Do not worry. It is fitting for the sun to be at midday, fitting to illuminate all under heaven.\" At midday, there is brightness; with brightness, there is movement; with movement, there is greatness. This is the king’s work. Who but the Sixth Five can fulfill this? Hence it is said: *lai zhang* (\"bringing splendor\"). *Lai zhang* means the Sixth Two’s midday splendor is drawn forth. The auspiciousness of celebration and praise is the prosperity of *feng*. The Sixth Two is the master of *Li*, the sun at its zenith, yet with thunder above, it bears the image of *feng*’s obscuring reeds and the Dipper seen at noon. Though one may doubt the sun’s presence when traveling, what harm befalls it? Its brilliance remains, and its sincerity never fails to shine. Who causes the obscuring reeds? The Nine Four does. Four resides in the *Zhen* trigram, the thunder’s first stir. Thus it is said: \"Its position is not proper, for it obscures its place.\" The Dipper seen at noon—dim and unclear—is injured; is this not *ming yi* (\"darkening of the light\")? Yet when clouds disperse and veils lift, the sun at noon reappears, and one again encounters the lord of brightness. Though dim and unclear, how can this not be auspicious? The auspiciousness of Four is like that of Five and Two. Since it is midday, the celebration of greatness is shared by all. Thus it is said: \"Auspicious, for it moves forward.\"\n\nThe Initial Nine and Six Two share the same luminous body. When the Initial meets the Second, does it not meet its proper lord? Yet because the Second is obscured by the reeds of *feng*, it is told: \"Even if ten days pass, after rain there will surely be the celebration of midday. Going forth, you will naturally find your match—why fear misfortune?\" The *Xiang* commentary further judges this as certain, for the principle of \"beyond ten days\" does not apply. If it exceeds ten days, it becomes calamity—no need to worry.\n\nThe Nine Three, positioned beneath the thunder’s movement, brings not only dark clouds and rain but torrential downpours. When the roads are awash with foam, even at midday, can one venture out? Of the three lines in *Li*, only the Second is at midday; the Initial and Third are like left and right arms. Yet the Third cannot move—it bears the image of a broken right arm. \"No misfortune\" means the passing of dark rain is not the fault of Nine Three. Truly, without brightness, there is no movement; to move without brightness is not greatness. Thus greatness for all under heaven is what the king esteems.\n\nThose who \"enlarge their houses\" act otherwise. They do not consider the sun at midday illuminating all under heaven, ensuring no one beneath it is left unenlightened. Instead, they diminish above to enrich below, enlarging their own houses, as if to say: \"I stand high above—who can do anything to me?\" Yet what use is this to anyone? For when a household has no one, when doors are shut and no one is seen, when ice melts and tiles crumble, leaving no trace—how dire is the misfortune! Thus the *Xiang* mocks them: \"When they enlarged their houses, they thought themselves soaring at heaven’s edge, as if roaming the skies—yet they did not realize this was precisely how they buried their own homes. For when a house has no household, when doors have no one to hide, this is called self-enlargement and self-burial—what use is a grand house then? This is no fault of others but of self-illumination that does not consider illuminating all under heaven. Those who illuminate themselves cannot illuminate others and instead fall into darkness. Yet those who illuminate all under heaven, though thunder and rain fill the skies, remain as if the sun is ever at its zenith. Thus the king should be at midday, illuminating all under heaven. To illuminate all under heaven is to bring greatness to all under heaven. Bringing greatness to all under heaven, even at its utmost, is not about seeking grandeur or delighting in achievement—celebration and praise naturally return to one. How can this compare to those who enlarge their houses and self-obscure, becoming isolated and ultimately burying themselves?\"\n\n**Appendix**\n*Fa qi hu, ban qi wu ren* (\"shutting the door, planking over the absence of people\"): *Fa* means to eliminate; *tai* means to discard. *Wei* means a small view; *tai mu* means to discard the eyes. Thus it speaks of first looking narrowly, then even with eyes wide open, seeing no one.\n\n---\n**Hexagram 56: *Lǚ* (Traveling)**\n*Lǚ*: Small prosperity. Perseverance in travel brings good fortune.\n\n**The *Tuan* Commentary**\n*Lǚ*: Small prosperity. The yielding attains the center externally and follows the firm. It halts yet clings to brightness—thus there is small prosperity. Perseverance in travel brings good fortune.

The noble one uses clarity and caution in applying punishments, not prolonging imprisonment.\n\n**The Lines**\n**Initial Six**: In travel, petty and mean—this brings misfortune upon oneself.\n**The *Xiang* Commentary**: Petty and mean in travel—misfortune arises from a constrained will.\n\n**Six Two**: In travel, one lodges at an inn, holding one’s resources, and obtains a steadfast servant.\n**The *Xiang* Commentary**: Obtaining a steadfast servant—ultimately, there is no blame.\n\n**Nine Three**: In travel, one’s inn burns.

Lodging in the wild, eating and resting—such is the traveler’s nature, hence it is called *Lǚ*. How does travel bring prosperity and good fortune? With *li*’s yielding in the outer position attaining the center, and submitting to *gèn*’s stillness within—the master’s firmness—thus the inner trigram’s stillness can cling to the outer trigram’s brightness. The master thereby achieves merit for the traveler, and the traveler naturally attains prosperity and good fortune, all through the constancy of travel.\n\nThe inner three lines represent the travels of merchants, scholars, and commoners—ordinary travel. Thus their gains and losses concern only the inn and servants. The outer three lines represent the travels of lords, ministers, and grandees—here, travel is momentous. Some rise through travel, others fall, hence it is said: *The timeliness of travel is greatly significant.*\n\n**Initial Six**, yin at the lowest, bears the image of petty travel, knowing only what travel should be. Petty and ignorant—this is why misfortune befalls. Had it been more generous, even the servant would have received a share of grace. Yet yin’s softness risks pettiness, while yang’s firmness risks excess. **Nine Three**, yang in a yang position, is excessive. Dry and near *li*, it bears the image of a burning inn; below, it loses the first, bearing the image of a lost servant. For Initial Six, of the same body below, is the servant’s image. Six Two, yielding and centered, draws near the first and gains it; Nine Three, overly firm, distances itself from the first and loses it. Thus the *Xiang* says: *The inn burns in travel—this is indeed grievous.* How could it also involve losing a servant? For in travel, to yield to inferiors thus—if one did not lose a servant, it would defy principle. Hence it is said: *by principle, one loses all.* Pettiness is difficult, but enduring excess—how can one bear it? Excess only deepens pettiness.\n\n**Six Two**, centered, bears the image of lodging at an inn; yielding and correct, it bears the image of holding resources; gaining the first, it bears the image of obtaining a steadfast servant—this is the most fortunate of ordinary travels. **Nine Four**, ascending to Five, bears the image of traveling in shelter. Those above should occupy their position and fulfill their duties. Yet if today they lodge here, tomorrow there, drifting from place to place, even if they gain their resource-axe, they remain rootless wanderers—how can the heart be at ease? At its extreme, **Top Nine** has *li*’s fire above, bearing the image of burning. *Li*’s eye sheds tears, bearing the image of wailing and weeping. *Li* nurtures the cow; the top yang loses it, bearing the image of an ox lost. Yet below, the inn burns; above, the nest burns—because the traveler below stops at the inn, while the traveler above, by necessity, loses their nest entirely. Were not Xia Taikang and Sui Yang Guang such cases? At first, they laughed in self-satisfaction; in the end, though they wailed, what good did it do?

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: \"With the traveler above, its principle is burning.\" This means that one who dwells above others yet remains a traveler on the road—if their nest is not burned, it is still inevitably doomed. Only the fifth line achieves success in this position. *Li* is the pheasant; the fifth line’s traveler shoots the pheasant. Initially, it was the image of Qian’s three yangs, like three arrows striking true. But when yang suddenly shifts to yin, one arrow is lost. In travel, this becomes the image of initial ventures failing or first undertakings going awry. Yet, abandoning Qian’s firm strength to attain the gentle brilliance of *wen*, one ultimately gains literary renown and a lofty mandate through the act of shooting the pheasant—hence it is said to \"reach above.\" Were not Xia Shaokang, Qi Xiaobai, and Jin Chong’er such cases?\n\nThe noble person observes travel and knows that those below cannot avoid going forth, while those above cannot lightly depart. Those who cannot avoid going forth do so either to seek fame and achievement or to amass wealth and profit. They treat servants as their own children and serve their masters as elder brothers; they do not covet money, nor do they lightly express joy or anger—thus they remain free of trouble forever. But how can those above travel on the road? If travel is unavoidable for those above, it is not for the sake of reputation or mandate; to \"reach above\" is decisively impossible.\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Ji said: \"Fire upon the mountain shines but does not illuminate—this is the image of brightness restrained and caution. Fire moves and does not stay—this is the image of impermanence. Travel is always adverse, but nothing is worse than being imprisoned. Prisons are established out of necessity; how can one remain trapped and long detained? Be as illuminating as fire, as steadfast as a mountain. All who sojourn abroad are travelers. The Son of Heaven has the Son of Heaven’s travels—such as when the Heavenly King resided in Zheng. The feudal lords have the feudal lords’ travels—such as when the Duke was assigned to Qianzhou. The grand officers have the grand officers’ travels—such as Chen Wenzi’s sojourn in another state. The sages and worthies have the sages’ and worthies’ travels—such as Confucius’s circuitous journeys and Mencius’s diplomatic missions.\n\nLiu Yongxiang said: \"King Wen traveled amid hardship, yet his intimacy was profound and his thoughts abundant—hence it is said, 'The traveler is petty and brings disaster upon himself.' It is also said: 'When traveling and lodging, though one gains their resource-axe, my heart is not at ease—how grievous! Traveler, who but King Wen could bear this?' The Master traveled east, west, south, and north—thus it is said: 'To travel with those below is to lose; to travel with those above is to burn.' There is no permissible course, whether above or below.\"\n\n**Xun (Wind)**\n*Xun*: Small success. Beneficial to have somewhere to go; beneficial to see the great person.\n\n**The Judgment** says: \"Repeated *xun* to issue commands. The firm *xun* in the center and correct, and their will is carried out. The yielding all submit to the firm—thus there is small success. Beneficial to have somewhere to go; beneficial to see the great person.\"\n\n**The Image** says: \"Following wind is *xun*. The noble person issues commands and carries out affairs.\"\n\n- **Initial Six**: Advancing and retreating—beneficial for the warrior’s steadfastness.\n  **The Image** says: \"Advancing and retreating—this is a wavering will. Beneficial for the warrior’s steadfastness—this is a disciplined will.\"\n\n- **Nine in the Second**: *Xun* beneath the forest. Employing scribes and shamans, profuse and auspicious—no blame.\n  **The Image** says: \"The auspiciousness of profusion—this is attaining the center.\"\n\n- **Nine in the Third**: Frequently *xun*—regret.\n  **The Image** says: \"The regret of frequent *xun*—this is a will exhausted.\"\n\n- **Six in the Fourth**: Regret vanishes. In the hunt, three kinds are obtained.\n  **The Image** says: \"In the hunt, three kinds are obtained—this is meritorious.\"\n\n- **Nine in the Fifth**: Steadfast and auspicious, regret vanishes. Nothing is initially beneficial. Without beginning, there is an end. Three days before *geng*, three days after *geng*—auspicious.\n  **The Image** says: \"The auspiciousness of Nine in the Fifth—this is the position of correctness and the center.\"\n\n- **Top Nine**: *Xun* beneath the bed. Losing one’s resource-axe—misfortune.\n  **The Image** says: \"*Xun* beneath the bed—this is exhaustion above. Losing one’s resource-axe—this is truly misfortune.\"\n\n**Xun is wind.**\nFang Shihua said: \"Wind is Heaven’s decree; commands are the ruler’s wind. When the great lord issues a mandate, thrice commanding and fivefold reiterating, he desires *xun* to penetrate—hence repeated *xun* to issue it. The nine in the second, firm yet *xun* in the center and correctness of the fifth, thus the will of issuing commands is carried out, and the yielding all submit to the firm. Therefore, there is small success, beneficial to have somewhere to go, and beneficial to see the great person. The benefit of having somewhere to go and the benefit of seeing—what else could this be but the small success of the lesser?\"\n\nNi’s *xun* says: \"The lord issues commands to proclaim to the four directions.\" Huan’s *xun* says: \"Huan sweats its great proclamation.\" Thus, nothing is as yielding yet able to *xun* and penetrate others as wind; nothing is as firm yet nothing can resist it as wind. Nothing dares not submit—only the nine in the fifth is sufficient to embody this, hence it is called the great person.\n\nMaster Yu said: \"*Jia* is the first of the ten stems, the beginning of affairs. When disorder is restored to order, it is as if returning to the start—hence in *Gu*, *jia* is said: 'In the end, there is a beginning.' *Geng* is the turning point of the ten stems, the proper moment for change in affairs. If the beginning was not good, it is changed and afterward becomes good—hence in *Xun*, *geng* is said: 'Without beginning, there is an end.' Three days before *geng*, three days after *geng*—repeatedly issuing commands—precisely means being cautious to the end. Thus, the end is auspicious. Therefore, only the fifth is steadfast and auspicious, with regret and nothing initially beneficial.\"\n\nThe initial six, at the beginning of *xun*, in terms of constant correspondence should respond to the fourth, but in terms of timing should submit to the fifth. Advancing and retreating without resolution—this is doubt. Not knowing that the fourth has decisively submitted to the fifth and eliminated the regret of indecision, it becomes the small success of the lesser and the meritorious minister. How martial! Moreover, the fourth submits to the fifth, and the three lines below all submit to the fifth—is this not the hunt obtaining three kinds? The fourth hunts and obtains three kinds—this is the warrior. Thus, it is beneficial for the initial line’s steadfastness as a warrior. Yet in the hexagram, only two yielding lines both submit to the firm—the fourth is their forerunner.\"",

To avoid losing one’s axe and resources is impossible.

      "translated_text": "Xiong Guo remarked: \"Zhai Yun’s 'three kinds' refer to the three lower lines.\" Yang Tingshu said: *\"The Shuo Gua* states that Xun (☴) embodies advance and retreat, hence its ultimate form is a restless hexagram, thus martial.\" **Dui (☱) below, Dui (☱) above: Dui.** Smooth progress, beneficial, steadfast.\n\n**The *Tuan* says:** Dui means joy. Firmness within and softness without—joy brings benefit through steadfastness. Thus, it accords with Heaven and responds to humanity. Joy leads the people, and they forget their toil; joy faces adversity, and they forget death. The greatness of joy spurs the people to effort.\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** Twin lakes form Dui. The noble person engages in discourse and study with friends.\n\n**First Nine:** Harmonious joy—auspicious.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The auspiciousness of harmonious joy lies in unhesitating action.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** Trusting joy—auspicious, regret vanishes.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The auspiciousness of trusting joy lies in the sincerity of one’s intent.\n\n**Six in the Third:** Seeking joy—misfortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The misfortune of seeking joy stems from an improper position.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth:** Deliberating joy—restless, yet illness yields to joy.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The joy of Nine in the Fourth brings celebration.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** Trust in stripping—danger.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Trust in stripping arises from a proper position.\n\n**Top Six:** Drawing out joy.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Top Six drawing out joy lacks brilliance.\n\nDui is the marsh. Fang Shihua said: \"Twin marshes form Dui. Dui means joy. Two marshes adjoining, two joys trusting—this is the Way of teacher and friend.\" The hexagram extols this Way to the point of moving Heaven and humanity, spurring the people to effort. Yet how is this achieved? Through friendship alone. Pervading the Five Bonds, all actions are deliberated, rectifying ruler and minister, so that all above and below become teacher and friend. Though this hexagram Dui derives its image from a single yin line, yin softness is not upright—how could it bring smooth progress? Thus, the hexagram speaks of \"beneficial steadfastness,\" and the *Zhuan* states: \"Firmness within and softness without—joy brings benefit through steadfastness.\" Only firmness within ensures steadfastness. Only firmness within with softness without explains why the four yang lines excel. Without firmness, there is no steadfastness; without steadfastness, misfortune follows—this is why the two yin lines falter. Observing the six lines, the meaning of friendship becomes clear.\n\nThe first line embodies joy and is called \"harmonious,\" while the fourth also embodies joy yet is termed \"deliberating\"—deliberation precludes harmony. At the outset of friendship, before faults emerge, all is pure harmony, hence it is struck as \"harmonious.\" Is this not the time when Master Liu of the Willow first emerged into the world? The weight of righteousness and the joy of reunion reside in the First Nine—stepping beyond the door, a single day’s fellowship. The fourth, however, suffers from the excesses of harmony, finding peace only through restraint. It does not delight in \"harmonious joy\" but rejoices in \"deliberating joy\"—does this not diverge from Bo Yi and Shu Qi’s remorse at blocking the horse? If one merely harmonizes light and blends dust, why seek friends at all? For this reason, both benefit. Not only can Liu Xia Hui remain unyielding before the Three Dukes, but even the sons of Mount Shouyang ultimately set aside old grievances—such is the mutual illumination of the first and fourth lines.\n\nThe second and fifth lines also mutually illuminate. Nine in the Second, firm and centered, directly trusts its intent, finding joy in sincerity. If joy arises from trust, how could it be false? Regret stems from joy, yet the second has no joy—how could regret arise? Thus, it aligns with the fifth. The fifth, receiving this, shares its firmness and centeredness, its trust and sincerity. Though the second’s direct pursuit of its intent seems to strip the fifth, the fifth trusts in this stripping. To be stripped yet accept it seems perilous and unbearable—yet its position is not properly aligned. Without this, how could one befriend a minister? Is this not like King Gaozong’s timely rain or Fu Yue’s salt and plum?\n\nThe third and top lines also mutually illuminate, yet their people are unworthy. The third seeks to draw near, using joy as its lure. The top follows, using joy to amplify its light. This is the exchange of marketplace dealings, the demeanor of flattery. Rare in ancient and modern times, yet still called \"my teacher, my friend\"—is this not lamentable? This hexagram exhaustively depicts the conditions of friendship, yet within it lies the great person. The great person seeks only to rectify themselves, not to rectify others, yet all friends are encompassed in their all-embracing care. Those who \"deliberate joy\" cannot avoid restraint, while those who \"harmonize joy\" verge on irreverence. Only Nine in the Fifth’s trust in stripping, unperturbed by danger, approaches this ideal.\n\n**Appendix:**\nHu Yizhi said: \"It is not called 'joy' (*shuo*) but 'Dui' because the sages’ influence on the world transcends words and speech, hence they remove speech and leave Dui.\"\n\nXiong Guo said: \"The fourth and third lines, though in different positions, remain sharply divided.\"\n\n**Kan (☵) below, Xun (☴) above: Huan.**\nSmooth progress. The king approaches the ancestral temple. Beneficial to ford great rivers, beneficial to be steadfast.\n\n**The *Tuan* says:** Huan—smooth progress. The firm comes and is not exhausted; the yielding attains its position externally and aligns above. \"The king approaches the ancestral temple\"—the king resides at the center. \"Beneficial to ford great rivers\"—riding wood brings success.\n\n**The *Xiang* says:** Wind moves over water—Huan. The former kings, offering to the Supreme Emperor, established temples.\n\n**First Six:** Rescuing with a strong horse—auspicious.\n**The *Xiang* says:** The auspiciousness of First Six lies in compliance.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** Huan flees to its support—regret vanishes.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Huan flees to its support\"—desires are fulfilled.\n\n**Six in the Third:** Huan disperses the self—no regret.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Huan disperses the self\"—the intent lies outward.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** Huan disperses the multitude—supremely auspicious. Dispersing forms a mound—beyond the thoughts of the common.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Huan disperses the multitude—supremely auspicious\"—its brilliance is vast.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** Huan sweats its great proclamation; Huan disperses the king’s dwelling—no blame.",

      "translated_text": "**The *Xiang* says:** \"The king’s dwelling is without blame\"—it is the correct position.\n\n**Top Nine:** Huan disperses its blood, removing and distancing itself—no blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Huan disperses its blood\"—it distances itself from harm.\n\n**Wind over Water: Huan**\nThe inner trigram is Kun, and one yang line of Qian comes to reside within it, thus generating water and forming Kan. Water arises without end, hence it is said: \"The firm comes and does not exhaust.\" The outer trigram is Qian, and one yin line of Kun attains its position externally, thus forming wind and generating Xun, aligning above with the fifth line. Hence it is said: \"The yielding attains its position externally and aligns above.\" Qian and Kun intermingle, and wind and water arise; wind and water interact, and the great proclamation is made. Thus, \"Huan sweats its great proclamation\"—who but the ruler could do this? Yet Nine in the Fifth, residing at the center, remains unmoved like the wind, gathering spiritual essence to borrow the ancestral temple—how would it dare to proclaim? Yet the great proclamation is made. Thus, it is Six in the Fourth that truly effects \"Huan sweats its great proclamation.\" The ruler issues commands; the wind’s voice is established by him, yet he allows a minister to act in his stead—how could there be no blame? However, this minister is one like Yu, whose teachings resounded to the four seas. With a minister like Yu, one may humbly face south, doing nothing yet governing—would this bring blame to Shun? Hence it is said: \"The king borrows the ancestral temple.\" The king is indeed at the center. To say \"the king is at the center\" is like the North Star dwelling in its place. Commands issue forth in all directions, and the people all comply. Thus, crossing the great river and building boats and oars is due to the fourth line. The people are like water; wind moves over water, and boats sail with the current—what disadvantage could there be? Therefore, though Six in the Fourth disperses, the king truly resides within it. The king does not await dispersion. Hence it is said: \"Huan, the king’s dwelling is without blame.\" If the minister disperses while the king resides, then the one who disperses, though a minister, is in truth the king—what blame could there be? Thus, Six in the Fourth is the master of dispersion, the one who effects it, yet only the fifth line can bring it to fruition. How would the top line dare to claim this? Hence, the fifth line is without blame, for it entrusts responsibility and fittingly borrows the temple to offer sacrifices. The top line must distance itself to avoid blame, for one who receives offerings for great merit fears harm may befall them. Hence it is said: \"Huan, its blood disperses, distancing itself within.\"\n\nThe three yin lines all receive dispersion. The third line resides above water—this is precisely what is meant by \"the face receives the harmonious wind\"—how could it not disperse itself? Only Six in the Fourth, as the master of dispersion, is supremely auspicious. The great cry disperses the multitude—this is the dispersion of private concerns. Thus, water flows downward while wind disperses upward, forming a mound against the current. Hence it is said: \"Huan forms a mound,\" for water levels and does not flow. When the dispersing wind flows, it moves with the current and forms patterns. Hence it is said: \"Huan disperses the multitude.\" This is the great achievement, naturally so—all beyond the thoughts of the common. How could it not be supremely auspicious? How could its brilliance not be vast?\n\nThe First and Second lines employ strength, rushing about with purpose—how could there be no smooth progress or advantage? The initial line of Kan, in relation to horses, has thin hooves, not comparable to a strong horse. Thus, the yielding first line resides below. Therefore, to employ rescue, one must have a strong horse to be auspicious. Hence it is said: \"Rescuing with a strong horse—auspicious.\" Otherwise, it would not comply with receiving dispersion. Nine in the Second, a single yang residing at the center, is like riding wood—this is the wooden support. Since the first line employs a strong horse, the second desires to fulfill its wish—how could it not rush to its support and ride upon the wood? Otherwise, regret would surely follow.\n\nAbove is Xun, below is Kan—wind above, water below. Wind and water interact, dispersing sweat and issuing the great proclamation. This hexagram’s image is like Yao obtaining Shun, and Shun obtaining Yu—no other can match it.\n\nFang Shihua said: \"Kan, in relation to wood, is hard and multivalent, hence the image of rushing to the support.\"\n\n**Water over Marsh: Jie**\n**Jie:** Smooth progress. Bitter restraint is inadmissible—persist in correctness.\n**The *Tuan* says:** Jie brings smooth progress. The firm and yielding are divided, and the firm attains the center. Bitter restraint is inadmissible—persisting in correctness leads to exhaustion. Joy moves through danger; attaining one’s position through restraint brings central correctness and smooth progress. Heaven and Earth are restrained, and the four seasons are completed. Restraint through institutions does not waste resources nor harm the people.\n**The *Xiang* says:** Water over the marsh—Jie. The noble one establishes measures and deliberates virtue and conduct.\n\n**First Nine:** Not going beyond the courtyard—no blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Not going beyond the courtyard\"—knowing what is open and blocked.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** Not going beyond the gate—misfortune.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Not going beyond the gate—misfortune\"—losing the extremity of the time.\n\n**Six in the Third:** If one does not restrain, there will be sighing—no blame.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Sighing over lack of restraint\"—who else to blame?\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** Peaceful restraint—smooth progress.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Smooth progress through peaceful restraint\"—following the way above.\n\n**Six in the Fifth:** Sweet restraint—auspicious; advancing brings esteem.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"The auspiciousness of sweet restraint\"—residing in the central position.\n\n**Top Six:** Bitter restraint—persistence brings misfortune, but regret vanishes.\n**The *Xiang* says:** \"Bitter restraint persisting in misfortune\"—its way is exhausted.\n\n**Water over Marsh: Jie**\nKan water flows, and Dui marsh receives it. Kan water flows to bring smooth progress, hence Nine in the Fifth, though in Kan, still brings smooth progress. Dui marsh receives it to bring restraint, hence Nine in the Second, though in the marsh, presides over restraint. Yet Dui has an opening above—if the opening is not blocked, though restrained, it is as if unrestrained. Six in the Third is yielding and cannot restrain, thus bringing sighs of misfortune. Nine in the Second is firm but not in its proper position, and fears the reproach of overstepping. Hence the sage speaks twice of its misfortune: its correctness lies in not going beyond the gate—it could go out but refuses to do so.",

      "translated_text": "Here the crux lies in reaching the extreme of lost timing—one could observe the moment and act, yet fails to move.\n\nNow, the trigrams unite as one body, sharing the same marsh in mutual reception. How can one sit idly without thought of blocking or restraining? Thus, the Way of presiding over restraint truly resides in Nine in the Second. Between the second and third lines, one firm and one yielding, Nine in the Second alone is firm and centered—hence the fullness of its responsibility.\n\nAbove, Kan water surges and overflows, no place for restraint. To insist on restraint at such a time is truly bitter, and cannot be called correct. Upper Six, yielding and miserly, bitterly ignorant of the Way of proper restraint, thus bears the warning of misfortune in correctness and the sorrow of exhausted Dao.\n\nHad Nine in the Fifth not been centered and correct in its smoothness, had it not practiced sweet restraint with due measure, allowing the flow to proceed, then the sweetness of Dui marsh would have turned into a bitter sea, its sweet waters transformed into bitterness—misfortune would have been unavoidable. Thus, the Way of smooth restraint lies entirely in Nine in the Fifth. Between the fifth and upper lines, one firm and one yielding, Nine in the Fifth alone is firm and centered—hence the sole attribution of auspicious sweet restraint. Thus it is said: \"Restraint brings smoothness.\"\n\nBitter restraint cannot be correct, for it originally sought to achieve smoothness through restraint. Now, by bitterly insisting on restraint, it leads only to exhaustion and blocked passage—this is not its proper principle.\n\nYet the upper trigram Kan water remains smooth, and smoothness naturally entails restraint. The lower trigram Dui marsh presides over restraint, and restraint naturally ensures flow. Thus, Nine in the Fourth in the upper trigram, following the upper Dao to find peace, speaks of \"peaceful restraint bringing smoothness.\" Smoothness here means the sweet restraint of centered correctness that enables flow.\n\nIn the lower trigram, Initial Nine, though not venturing beyond the gate and courtyard, may sit peacefully without blame. Without blame means knowing that there are those who manage flow and blockage, thus avoiding fault. Flow has five, blockage has two—Nine in the Second restrains them. Nine in the Fifth sweetens them, while Initial Nine and Nine in the Fourth merely enjoy the results—is this not fitting?\n\n**Appendix**\nLiu Yongxiang says: Restraint, though correct in principle, if bitter, becomes misfortune even in correctness. Once restraint is taken as correctness, how can one regret it? Thus it is said: \"Regret vanishes\"—this is reproach, not approval.\n\nAlas! Those who take frugality and austerity as great virtues, who pride themselves on hardship and thrift, would they ever admit their bitter restraint as wrong and regret it? Among ten thousand, scarcely one can regret their own bitter restraint—calling it \"regret vanishes\" is fitting.\n\nIn this hexagram, firm and yielding are divided, with the firm attaining the center: one yielding line from Kun is placed at the top of the lower trigram to form Dui marsh, and one firm line from Qian is placed in the center of the upper trigram to form Kan water.\n\n**Wind over Marsh: Zhong Fu**\n\"Pig and fish: auspicious. Beneficial to ford great rivers. Beneficial in correctness.\"\n*The Image* says: Zhong Fu: yielding within while the firm attains the center. Joyful and yielding, sincerity transforms the state. \"Pig and fish: auspicious\"—sincerity extends even to pigs and fish. \"Beneficial to ford great rivers\"—riding an empty wooden boat. Zhong Fu with beneficial correctness responds to Heaven.\n\n*The Image* says: Wind over marsh: Zhong Fu. The noble one discusses lawsuits and delays executions.\n\n**Line Statements**\n**Initial Nine:** \"Trust in anticipation: auspicious. With other matters, no peace.\"\n*The Image* says: Initial Nine’s trust in anticipation is auspicious—its will has not changed.\n\n**Nine in the Second:** \"A crane calls in the shade, its young responds. I have fine wine, I share it with you without end.\"\n*The Image* says: \"Its young responds\"—this is the heart’s desire.\n\n**Six in the Third:** \"Encountering an enemy, now drumming, now ceasing; now weeping, now singing.\"\n*The Image* says: \"Now drumming, now ceasing\"—its position is not proper.\n\n**Six in the Fourth:** \"The moon nearly full, the horse’s mate lost—no blame.\"\n*The Image* says: \"The horse’s mate lost\"—cutting ties to ascend.\n\n**Nine in the Fifth:** \"Sincerity in bonds—no blame.\"\n*The Image* says: \"Sincerity in bonds\"—its position is correct and proper.\n\n**Upper Nine:** \"Cock’s crow reaching heaven—correctness brings misfortune.\"\n*The Image* says: \"Cock’s crow reaching heaven\"—how can this last?\n\n**Wind over Marsh: Zhong Fu**\nZhang Zai says: Zhong Fu: above, Xun wind acts; below, Dui joy receives it—there must be transformation through resonance. Sincerity is like a brooding hen, embodying the principle of inevitable birth.\n\nHe also says: The child is transformed by sincerity. Only through Zhong Fu can one transform the child; only through Zhong Fu can one respond to the mother. Thus it is said: \"Zhong Fu with beneficial correctness responds to Heaven.\" To respond to Heaven is correctness—this refers specifically to Zhong Fu’s ability to respond. If it does not respond in reality but merely bears an empty name, it becomes Upper Nine’s cock’s crow. Though it reaches heaven, can heaven transform through sincerity?\n\nThus, the line statement for Nine in the Second says: \"A crane calls in the shade, its young responds. I have fine wine; I share it with you without end.\" Upper and lower forget themselves in this \"you and I,\" the fine wine ungrudgingly given—rereading this line, how is it different from a shared song? It perfectly embodies the *Three Hundred Poems*’ expression of the sage’s sentiment.\n\nThis may show Nine in the Fifth’s \"sincerity in bonds,\" but it is fundamentally because Nine in the Second truly responds to it. Both Nine in the Second and Nine in the Fifth are firm and centered. Firmness in the center is substance; substance enables sincere transformation. Yielding within is emptiness; emptiness makes sincere transformation difficult—yet who could have known otherwise?\n\nWho could have known that in this hexagram Zhong Fu, with yielding within and firmness centered, joyful and yielding, it naturally embodies sincerity and transforms the state? Had it not sincerely responded to Nine in the Fifth, even Upper Nine’s firmness would not escape the flaw of fine sound without substance—why insist on yielding? If it can sincerely respond to Nine in the Fifth, even Six in the Fourth’s yielding can nearly reach fullness and achieve great things—why limit it to firmness?",
      "overlap_context": "int, hence Nine in the Second, though in the marsh, presides over restraint.

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: In Zhong Fu, even the pig and fish are auspicious; it is beneficial to ford the great river. In this hexagram, the third and fourth lines within are both yin, empty and insubstantial—these are the pig and fish, the hollow boat. Now observe Six in the Fourth and Six in the Third: of the same kind, they were once paired as mates, as old rivals. Yet Three, embodying joy without rectitude, loses balance in sorrow and delight; Four thus rejects its impropriety, severs its kindred bond, forsakes its mate and rival, and ascends directly to bear Five—thereby attaining blamelessness. How then does Four’s sincerity transform Five? Can one say that Zhong Fu’s sincerity cannot extend even to pigs and fish?\n\nMoreover, the two yin lines within form the image of central emptiness; by this inner void, riding the compliant qi of Xun, one crosses the hollow boat to ford the great river—how greatly does this benefit Five? Can one say that Zhong Fu cannot bring auspice even to pigs and fish, or that it is not fitting to do so?\n\nThus, speaking of Zhong Fu’s substance: its sincerity transforms Two, as the crane’s call summons its young in harmony. Speaking of Zhong Fu’s utmost: its sincerity transforms Four, as near-perfection dissolves all rivalry. Only when sincerity transforms the state and even pigs and fish are trusted can one verify that nothing lies beyond Zhong Fu’s transforming power. What then remains of distinctions between firm and yielding, empty and full? How could it be confined to the firmness of Initial Nine?\n\nFor Initial Nine, at the hexagram’s beginning, alone finds joy and contentment in self-preservation, reasoning that if it cannot attain the sincerity of Five and recklessly alters its will to follow another, it would be less auspicious than preserving itself. Does it not stir in response to Two, burning incense in anticipation? And by this, Five reaches the fullness of transforming sincerity.",

      "translated_text": "Pigs and fish belong to the yin class. In *Gou* (Hexagram 44), \"the fish is enveloped\"; in *Bo* (Hexagram 23), \"Six in the Fifth place strings the fish together.\" *Gou*, *Yingshi* (Hexagram 43), *Daxu*’s Six in the Fifth, and *Jishi* (Hexagram 26) all exemplify this. The crane and the heavens both refer to Five, while its young refers solely to Two. *Xun* (the trigram) represents the chicken, called \"the sound of wings.\" Wang’s edition annotates: \"In yin, it is the second yin.\" Ma Fengyang states: \"*Zhong Fu* (Hexagram 61) resembles the image of a bird covering its eggs. The two yin lines form the shape of a chicken’s feet.\"\n\n**Appendix**\nWang Ji says: \"Wind stirring the marsh embodies the image of *Zhong Fu*. The noble person, embodying Heaven and Earth’s virtue of cherishing life, deliberates on punishments and delays executions—this is the meaning of *Zhong Fu*. When a case is about to be concluded, it is deliberated; when a sentence is about to be carried out, it is delayed, thus fulfilling the human heart. To deliberate on a case is to seek a path from judgment to life; to delay is to seek life within death. Shun’s compassion in punishment, Yu’s tears for the guilty, Tang’s prayers at the net, and Wen’s burial of bones—if these did not arise from the sincerity of the heart, who would be moved by them? The Way of utmost sincerity can tread upon water and fire, melt metal and stone, reach Heaven and Earth, and move humankind—how much more the spirits and gods? The king listens to the Three Dukes, listens to the Minister of Justice, listens to the deliberation of cases—this is the deliberation of punishment. After ten days, the case is reviewed; after twenty days, it is reviewed again; after three months, it is submitted—this is the delay of execution. The deliberation of punishment corresponds to the *Dui* (trigram) image; the delay of execution, to the *Xun* (trigram) image.\"\n\n**Gen below, Zhen above: Xiao Guo (Hexagram 62)**\n*Xiao Guo* (Small Exceeding): Smooth progress, beneficial for constancy. Suitable for small matters, not for great ones. The sound of a flying bird leaves its echo—it is not fitting to ascend, fitting to descend; greatly auspicious.\n\n**The Judgment says:**\n*Xiao Guo* means that small excesses lead to smooth progress. Exceeding in a way that benefits constancy aligns with the movement of the times. The yielding attains the center, hence small matters are auspicious. The firm loses its position and is not central, hence great matters are not suitable. There is the image of a flying bird: the sound of a flying bird leaves its echo—it is not fitting to ascend, fitting to descend; greatly auspicious. Ascending is contrary, descending is compliant.\n\n**The Image says:**\nThunder above the mountain—*Xiao Guo*. The noble person, in conduct, exceeds in reverence; in mourning, exceeds in grief; in use, exceeds in frugality.\n\n**Line Statements:**\n**Initial Six:** The flying bird brings misfortune.\n**The Image says:** The flying bird brings misfortune—nothing can be done about it.\n\n**Six in the Second Place:** Exceeding one’s grandfather, encountering one’s grandmother; not reaching one’s lord, encountering one’s minister—no blame.\n**The Image says:** Not reaching one’s lord, the minister must not exceed.\n\n**Nine in the Third Place:** If one does not exceed in guarding against it, following may lead to harm—misfortune.\n**The Image says:** Following may lead to harm—how could misfortune be avoided?\n\n**Nine in the Fourth Place:** No blame. Do not exceed, but encounter it. Going forward is dangerous—be ever vigilant. Do not persist in constancy.\n**The Image says:** Do not exceed, but encounter it—the position is not appropriate. Going forward is dangerous—be ever vigilant, for in the end it cannot last.\n\n**Six in the Fifth Place:** Dense clouds, no rain, from my western suburbs. The lord shoots and takes that which is in the cave.\n**The Image says:** Dense clouds, no rain—this is excessive ascent.\n\n**Top Six:** Not encountering, but exceeding it; the flying bird is ensnared—misfortune. This is called disaster and calamity.\n**The Image says:** Not encountering, but exceeding it—this is excessive arrogance.\n\n**Commentary on Xiao Guo:**\nFour yin lines attain their positions, two yang lines lose theirs—this is *Xiao Guo*. The small, having gained their time and position, exceed. How could this not lead to smooth progress? Yet exceeding may bring smooth progress, but lacking constancy is not permissible. Exceeding in a way that benefits constancy aligns with the movement of the times, for the time is ripe for action. The yielding also attains the center, hence small matters are auspicious, and thus it is said to be suitable only for small matters. However, occupying a position and attaining the center, whether as lord or minister, the affairs are great, not small. Only a firm and strong noble person can manage them. Now, the firm has lost its position and is not central. Occupying the upper position without centrality, losing position and authority—though firm and strong, what can be done? Hence great matters are not suitable, and thus it pertains to the small. If small matters can be accomplished, one acts in accordance with the times; if great matters cannot be accomplished, one defers to the noble person and hopes for their assistance. If one can act with sincerity, knowing one’s place and the times, then even if the position of the small exceeds, in reality it leads to smooth progress. Thus it is said that the small exceed and attain smooth progress because of their constancy. Yet the yielding and weak cannot know their place or the times. They refuse to encounter the yang. Now, the two yin lines occupy the center and attain their positions, assuming the roles of lord and minister. Yet those they align with are the two flying birds of the initial and top lines—even if one or two yang lines remain, they naturally retreat in haste. Therefore, the sage, observing the image of flying birds in this hexagram, uses it as a warning: the flying bird leaves its echo—it is not fitting to ascend, fitting to descend; greatly auspicious. When a bird flies upward, it is contrary; when it flies downward, it is compliant. Now, to claim that descending is fitting and ascending is not—though it may seem self-admonition, it is in truth admonition for the two yang lines. How could a firm and strong noble person wait for the yielding and weak to admonish them to leave before bowing their heads and departing? I fear the flying bird will be ensnared, and though it may wish to leave, it will be unable.\n\n**Initial Six**, dwelling below, delights in advancement and reckless ascent—truly a flying bird. Thus the sage strikes it, saying: This is a flying bird. Though it is at the very beginning and below, the omen of misfortune is already formed. How much more when it clings to the four yin lines or climbs to **Top Six**? It is indeed a creature of misfortune—truly nothing can be done about it. For the two yang lines, is it not better to avoid it early? Yet **Nine in the Fourth Place** responds to it and instead attains no blame, for it knows its strength is insufficient to exceed and ultimately meets it well. However, where there is coming, there must be going; where there is going, there must be danger—can one not be vigilant? How could the world tolerate matters of constant danger and perpetual vigilance?",
      "overlap_context": "ns between firm and yielding, empty and full? How could it be confined to the firmness of Initial Nine?\n\nFor Initial Nine, at the hexagram’s beginning, alone finds joy and contentment in self-preservation, reasoning that if it cannot attain the sincerity of Five and recklessly alters its will to follow another, it would be less auspicious than preserving itself. Does it not stir in response to Two, burning incense in anticipation? And by this, Five reaches the fullness of transforming sincerity.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: where there is danger in going, one must be vigilant—yet this cannot endure forever. From this it follows: how much better to refrain from action altogether. To refrain is to preserve one’s primordial danger; preserving primordial danger is to maintain constancy and firmness.\n\nAs for **Nine in the Third Place**, though it knows it cannot surpass and thus strives to guard against it, **Top Six** will take this as intentional provocation. Then, failing to measure its own strength, it may seek to destroy it—like Chen Fan or Bao Wu. I know not how much greater the misfortune will be.\n\nFor in the time of *Small Exceeding*, the first and top lines stand in comparison, wielding power and securing position. The firm and strong nobleman has but one move to consider: to refrain. There is no other good strategy. This is what is meant by \"it is fitting to be below and not fitting to be above.\"\n\n**Six in the Fifth Place**, a yin cloud risen high, does not meet with yang. A lone yin cannot complete the image—it becomes \"dense clouds with no rain.\" Thus it is said: \"Dense clouds with no rain, for it has risen above.\" The qi of **Six in the Fifth Place** has already ascended; it is utterly incapable of descending as rain to nourish the people. Though it dwells above the people, in truth it is no different from those below—whether as minister or as matriarch, how can it accomplish anything?\n\nOne master said: Does this not warn the three men who, unable to serve as ancestors, instead honored their matriarchs; unable to serve as rulers, instead honored their ministers? **Six in the Second Place**, yielding and soft, cautiously preserves itself from blame, yet in truth it cannot surpass its ancestor, nor even reach its ruler. Yet it deludes itself into believing it has surpassed its ancestor and reached its ruler—is this not folly?\n\nThe line does not speak of \"surpassing its ruler\" but of \"reaching its ruler,\" for the sage’s single word weighs heavily for rulers of all ages. Thus it is said: \"It does not reach its ruler, for a minister must not surpass.\" Therefore the Master, in the *Image*, specially elucidates this principle to warn all generations.\n\nYet **Six in the Second Place**, like a creature in its burrow, is a small thing unable to take flight. The master, then, knows only to hunt the small creatures in their burrows, unable to mount the dragon and ride the heavens to behold the greatness of humanity. How then can they join together to accomplish anything? For yin does not meet yang—how can the two be completed? Yin seeking yin again—how can it obtain the timely rain of Fu Yue?\n\n**Top Six** has reached the extreme of *Small Exceeding* and is cut off from **Three**; not only does it refuse to meet, but it exceeds it by far. If **Three** does not depart, the flying bird above will soon leave it. As a creature of misfortune, it is no longer like the first—excess brings disaster, excess brings warning. I fear the solitary yang will ultimately find no escape.\n\nAlas! The first and top are creatures of misfortune; the second and fifth are wooden idols. Though there be a Master, what can he do for Ding and Ai? Not serving is the best strategy; tending fields and managing granaries is the middle strategy; serving as Minister of Justice in Lu is the worst. Resigning after three months saves half.",

      "translated_text": "Su Zizhan said: *Small Exceeding* bears the image of a bird. Four yin lines occupy the positions of action, forming its wings. Two yang lines are imprisoned within—its belly and back. The wings wish to fly toward the belly and back, yet cannot restrain the wings; they wish to restrain the belly and back, yet cannot act. Thus, the control of the flying bird lies in the wings.\n\nChao Yidao said: In times when there was the overreaching Mo Ao, there was also Zheng Kaofu, who corrected him by \"walking along the wall.\" In times when there was Zai Yu, who observed short mourning, there was Gao Chai, who corrected him with \"weeping blood.\" In times when there was Guan Zhong, who took three wives and returned with blemish, there was Yanzi, who corrected him by \"rewarding furs.\" Though not following the middle path, they were sufficient to rectify the times and sharpen customs.\n\nBelow *Li*, above *Kan*: *Already Across*. *Already Across*: small prosperity, profit in constancy; at first auspicious, in the end disorder.\n\nThe *Tuan* says: *Already Across*—prosperity, for the small prospers. Profit in constancy, for the firm and yielding are correct and their positions proper. At first auspicious, for the yielding attains the center. In the end, cessation brings disorder—its Way is exhausted.\n\nThe *Xiang* says: Water above fire—*Already Across*. The noble person, mindful of calamity, takes precautions in advance.\n\n**First Nine**: Dragging its wheels, wetting its tail—no blame.\nThe *Xiang* says: Dragging its wheels—rightly no blame.\n\n**Six Two**: The wife loses her hairpin; do not pursue it—it will be recovered in seven days.\nThe *Xiang* says: Recovered in seven days, by the central Way.\n\n**Nine Three**: Gaozong campaigns against Guifang; after three years, he conquers it—petty men must not be employed.\nThe *Xiang* says: After three years, he conquers it—exhaustion.\n\n**Six Four**: The ragged one has tattered clothes; all day on guard.\nThe *Xiang* says: All day on guard—there is cause for doubt.\n\n**Nine Five**: The eastern neighbor slaughters an ox, yet does not receive as much blessing as the western neighbor’s simple offering.\nThe *Xiang* says: The eastern neighbor slaughters an ox, yet does not match the western neighbor’s timely offering. Truly receiving blessing—great fortune arrives.\n\n**Top Six**: Wetting its head—danger.\nThe *Xiang* says: Wetting its head—danger; how can this last long?\n\nIn the hexagram *Already Across*, each instance speaks of \"small prosperity,\" never \"prosperity in smallness.\" Now, *Already Across* speaks of \"small prosperity,\" for prosperity after crossing must be small, not great. If great, it ends in disorder, worse than the initial auspiciousness of the small. Why? The small is *Li*—*Li* is emptiness. The great is *Kan*—*Kan* is cessation.\n\nNow observe: the first line, positioned below the clarity of *Li*, marks the beginning of *Already Across*. Though already crossed, it remains as if uncrossed, with the peril of *Kan* ahead. Wetting the horse’s tail, it drags its wheels, not daring to hastily ford—such is its heart. Could this bring blame? Is there such a principle? Thus, it is rightly without blame. This is the first principle of *Already Across*.\n\nThe second line, with luminous virtue at its center, is free from obstruction. Not only is this self already across, but this heart also crosses with it—body and heart both crossed, truly *Already Across*. As a pure yin, a wife’s image, it was once unobstructed, losing its hairpin. After seven days, the central Way returns. Having once been obstructed, it grasps the cause of losing the hairpin, no longer chasing after scenes of success or splendor, thus preserving *Already Across* forever. Thus, it is said: \"At first auspicious, the yielding attains the center.\" Is not *Already Across*’s small prosperity due to this? How could it resemble the third line’s fondness for grandeur and love of achievement?\n\nNow observe: even the worthy Gaozong could not avoid employing petty men to raise troops and attack. How much less others? Even with a great state’s might, campaigning against the petty Guifang still required three years to conquer. Though conquered, its exhaustion was extreme. Had it not been for Gaozong’s worthiness, how could he have avoided the rise of extravagant ambitions?",

      "translated_text": "The rise of extravagant desires breeds indolent complacency, and *Already Across* can no longer be preserved—its ultimate disorder is assured. Thus, at the ninth pentagram, seasonal sacrifices are conducted, with grand offerings of livestock to beseech blessings from the divine spirits. Yet how could they know that those who make timely, modest offerings—rather than lavish displays—truly receive such blessings?\n\nFor once the self has attained *Already Across*, stilling the heart becomes easy. The sixth yang line, positioned above the perilous *Kan* (Water), indulges in dissipation and drenches itself—precisely the figure of one who brings final disorder. How could such a state endure?\n\nSome may ask: If this is so, then why is one who remains vigilant all day also counted among those who bring final disorder? The answer: The noble person’s constant vigilance arises from fear that even one person might fail to receive the warmth of their beneficence. Yet if one’s vigilance extends only to the initial garment—merely clothing the destitute—then it amounts to nothing more than charity toward the poor. To obsess over a single garment, to doubt and fear its loss day and night, is laughable. To preserve what need not be preserved, or to fail to preserve what should be preserved—both lead to the same loss of what truly matters. Thus it is said: \"To halt in the end is to invite disorder.\" The act of halting derives from the image of encountering *Kan* and stopping.\n\nFang Shihua observes: *Li* (Fire) means \"adherence.\" It does not resemble *Li* as armor, spears, or weapons; thus, the campaign against the third line is called \"governing darkness,\" and the target is termed *Guifang*. \"Vigilance all day\" arises from riding the culmination of *Li*. *Li* is the female ox. *Li* is bound, and *Kan* is its neighbor—hence the fifth line. It is said: *Kan* neighbors the west, while *Li* neighbors the east. The second line is called \"west,\" neighboring the second through timely use.\n\nHui Gong, frugal and without demands, forever ensures success—thus it is called \"auspicious.\" Is this not the \"initial auspiciousness\"? Yet by the sixth line, *Kan*’s waters have overflowed, and having enjoyed *Already Across*, one knows only feasting and revelry to the end. The noble person drinks in adversity, drinks when awaiting opportunity—to demonstrate composure. But who has heard of drinking after *Already Across*? To indulge in revelry after success is to court sorrow in the end—how could one not drown like a tile soaked in wine?\n\n**Appendix**\nYang Jian says: *Ji* (既) means \"exhaustion.\" *Already Across* means nothing is left unaccomplished. The phrase \"favorable to constancy\" refers to the first, third, and fifth lines—all odd, firm, and unadulterated—while the second, fourth, and top lines are even, yielding, and equally pure. The fifth yang line is properly positioned above the sixth, and the second yin line is properly positioned below; all firm and yielding lines occupy their rightful places. If this is not constancy, what is? *Nuò* (糯), as Zixia writes, is the same as *nuò* (懦, \"weak\"). The *Nei Ze* speaks of the rites for a youth: \"Clothing should not be of silk or *nuò*-fabric.\" The *Shuowen* states: *Nuò* means \"short garment.\" Tattered clothing, like decayed greens, is called *rú* (茹).\n\n**Below Kan, Above Li: Not Yet Across**\n*Not Yet Across*: Prospering, the young fox nearly crosses but soaks its tail—no advantage.\n**The Judgment** says: *Not Yet Across* prospers, for the yielding attains the center. The young fox nearly crosses, yet remains within the center. Soaking its tail brings no advantage, for it cannot continue to the end. Though the lines are not in their proper positions, the firm and yielding respond to one another.\n**The Image** says: Fire above water—*Not Yet Across*. The noble person carefully distinguishes things and assigns them their proper places.\n\n**First Six**: Soaking its tail—regret.\n**The Image** says: Soaking its tail—it knows no bounds.\n\n**Nine in the Second**: Dragging its wheels—constancy brings good fortune.\n**The Image** says: The second yang’s constancy brings good fortune, for it moves rightly from the center.\n\n**Six in the Third**: *Not Yet Across*—advancing brings misfortune, but crossing the great river is favorable.\n**The Image** says: Advancing in *Not Yet Across* brings misfortune, for the position is improper.\n\n**Nine in the Fourth**: Constancy brings good fortune, regrets vanish. With thunderous force, it campaigns against *Guifang*; after three years, it is rewarded by a great state.\n**The Image** says: Constancy brings good fortune, regrets vanish—its will is fulfilled.\n\n**Six in the Fifth**: Constancy brings good fortune, no regrets. The noble person’s radiance—having sincerity, good fortune.\n**The Image** says: The noble person’s radiance—its brilliance is auspicious.\n\n**Top Nine**: Sincerity in drinking wine—no blame. Soaking its head—sincerity loses its rightness.\n**The Image** says: Drinking wine and soaking the head—it knows no moderation.\n\n**Fire and Water: Not Yet Across**\n*Not Yet Across* means not yet having crossed. To hastily attempt crossing without having done so is the folly of the young, who know not the peril’s extremity. This is the meaning of \"the young fox nearly crosses but soaks its tail\"—no advantage, for it cannot continue and thus ends in failure. Like Fu Jian’s million-strong army encamped at the Huai River, it was truly so. For when the self still lies in peril, unable to emerge, yet rashly soaks its tail to cross—what is this if not ignorance of the peril’s extremity?\n\nThe second yang line understands this and alone drags its wheels without crossing. Thus, the line alone speaks of constancy bringing good fortune, and **The Image** reiterates its right conduct—no empty words. The third yin line, though above *Kan*, has not yet left *Kan*; to advance would bring misfortune, and it cannot simply proceed. Yet it ascends to the fourth yang line, which occupies the third position of *Li*. For what it rides upon—now the fifth yin line has sincerity toward the fourth, and the fourth, with thunderous force, campaigns. Though it does not follow the fourth’s trust in the fifth to advance, the fifth gains the fourth’s aid to cross *Kan*, meeting the moment and opportunity. Though the third does not advance, it naturally finds advantage in crossing the great river. Why rush? For where there is a ruler, there must be ministers; where there are ministers, affairs must be accomplished. *Not Yet Across* will ultimately become *Already Across*, and naturally, crossing the great river will be favorable. This is why *Not Yet Across* prospers.\n\nThus it is said: *Not Yet Across* prospers. In the time of *Not Yet Across*, there must naturally be one who can cross. Where there is one who can cross, there must naturally be ministers who can cross. Where there are ministers who can cross, there must naturally come a day when crossing is achieved. Once crossing is achieved, it prospers. Thus it is said: *Not Yet Across* prospers—the yielding attains the center. Yielding yet attaining the center, inwardly radiant with culture, it can thus secure the perilous crossing.",
      "overlap_context": "s small prosperity due to this? How could it resemble the third line’s fondness for grandeur and love of achievement?\n\nNow observe: even the worthy Gaozong could not avoid employing petty men to raise troops and attack. How much less others? Even with a great state’s might, campaigning against the petty Guifang still required three years to conquer. Though conquered, its exhaustion was extreme. Had it not been for Gaozong’s worthiness, how could he have avoided the rise of extravagant ambitions?",

      "translated_text": "Thus, in the fifth line it is said: \"Steadfast and auspicious, free from great regret.\" And further: \"The radiance of the noble one, with sincerity, is auspicious.\" This speaks of the fifth line’s steadfast auspiciousness without regret, truly because its cultured brilliance resides within, possessing the radiance of the noble one. The reason for this radiance of the noble one lies in its ability to hold sincerity toward the nine in the fourth place, its surplus light extending to the fourth—hence its auspiciousness. Therefore it is said: \"The radiance of the noble one, its splendor is auspicious.\" Where there is radiance, there must be splendor; without splendor, its radiance would not be seen.\n\nThus, in the time of *Not Yet Across*, though there be such a luminous ruler, one cannot but lack splendor. One cannot but prosper. Observing this, I see that in the sage’s engagement with the world, there is not a single day that is not a time of *Already Across*, nor a single day without the heart of *Not Yet Across*. There is not a single moment that is not a day of *Not Yet Across*, nor a single day without the thought of crossing. Anxiety may arrive while joy still lingers, or joy may just arrive when anxiety arises again. With joy and sorrow following one another, this is why the sage exerts effort without realizing old age is approaching.\n\nTherefore, *Already Across* and *Not Yet Across* unite as one hexagram, and the Dao of the *Changes* reaches its end. The *Creative*’s ceaseless self-strengthening, diligent all day and vigilant by evening, does so for a reason. As for those who drink wine until their heads are soaked, taking *Already Across* as an excuse for slackening, unaware that *Not Yet Across* follows behind—who are they? They are the ones the sage calls \"those who cannot endure,\" \"those who do not continue to the end.\" The ruler loses the state, the minister loses his house, the commoner loses his life, and the scholar loses his heart. From ancient times to the present, who has escaped this? Alas.",

      "translated_text": "Master Fang Shihua said: The fox embodies *Kan* (☵, the Abysmal), and *Kan* remains *Not Yet Across*. Only upon reaching *Li* (☲, the Clinging) is it *Across*. Thus the *Commentary* speaks of *Not Yet Across* as offering prosperity. \"The yielding attains the center\" refers to the outer *Li*’s six in the fifth place. \"The young fox nearly crosses\" speaks of not yet emerging, pointing to the inner *Kan*’s initial six. Now, the campaign against Guifang: in *Already Across*, one should refrain from action and guard against three years of exhaustion; in *Not Yet Across*, one should act with awe and hope for three years of reward. *Already Across* warns against stirring up trouble; *Not Yet Across* delights in achievement.\n\nThe fifth of *Li* governs the fourth, and \"holding to constancy brings good fortune and dispels regret\"—the fifth itself should thus \"hold to constancy, good fortune, and no regret.\" The top nine relies on the six in the fifth’s trust to offer sacrifice, and the great enterprise of *Already Across* is feasting and revelry. Yet before long, to soak one’s head in wine is to equal the top six of *Already Across*, and the momentum is bound to fail. Such is the brilliance of trust in the enterprise of *Already Across*—yet how swiftly it reverses! To cross only to lose again—were not the Tang Emperor Ming and others such cases?\n\nMinister Liu Yongxiang said: Heaven-one generates water, Earth-two generates fire. Water and fire are the great functions of Heaven and Earth. *Qian* (☰, the Creative) and *Kun* (☷, the Receptive) thus conclude with *Kan* and *Li*. When *Kan*-water resides below and *Li*-fire above, though they possess the functions of Heaven and Earth, in truth they do not serve one another. *Xian* (☶, Influence) and *Heng* (☳, Duration) thus conclude with *Li* and *Kan*. When water ascends and fire descends, *Kan* and *Li* interact, the heart is at peace, the body is healthy, the state is harmonious—what affair would not be *Already Across*? This is the culmination of Heaven and Earth. How could there be a principle of initial good fortune ending in disorder? Is it not fitting that the Dao of the *Changes* concludes thus?\n\n**Appendix**\nWu Youqing said: In *Not Yet Across*, none of the lines occupy their proper positions. Yet the *Image Commentary* singles out the six in the third place because yin-softness dwells at the extreme of danger.\n\nWang Fusi said: Though the nine in the second place is not in its proper position, it moves with correctness from the center. The six in the fifth is yielding, compliant, and radiant, occupying the honored position. It entrusts matters to the capable without self-exertion, employing martial strength with culture and governing hardness with softness—truly the brilliance of the noble person. To entrust things to the capable without doubt is to make others exert their utmost, and success is thus achieved. Hence it is said: \"With trust, good fortune.\"\n\nYang Tingshu said: The six in the fifth encounters the era of *Not Yet Across* yet responds with yin-softness. Yet by holding to constancy it attains good fortune, by sincerity it attains further good fortune, and by brilliance it attains yet further good fortune—why? The six in the fifth embodies *Li*. *Li* in Heaven is the sun; on Earth, it is fire. The sun in summer grows ever hotter, and fire at night burns ever brighter. The six in the fifth’s radiance is so abundant that it can empty its center to illuminate all, while the hundred officials stand firm in sincerity and trust. How could worthy talent fail to sweep away great peril and transform an era of primal difficulty into a time when *Not Yet Across* becomes *Already Across*? Possessing the fullness of threefold good fortune without a trace of regret or blame—what doubt could remain?\n\n*This concludes the third scroll of the Lower Canon of the* Yi Yin.",
