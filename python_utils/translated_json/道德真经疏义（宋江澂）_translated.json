  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (Moral Teachings of the *Dao De Jing*)**\n*Title:* **Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (Moral Teachings of the *Dao De Jing*)**\n*By Jiang Cheng (宋江澄)*\n*Fourteen Scrolls*\n*Source Text:* *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), *Dongshen* (洞神) Section, *Yujue* (玉诀) Category\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the *Dao De Jing***\n\nWith reverence, I acknowledge the Sacred Sovereign’s enlightenment, whose teachings illuminate the Dao and the True. In moments of leisure and clarity, he selected *Laozi’s* *Dao De Jing*, elucidating each sentence to bless the world.\n\nAs a subject among the assembled scholars, a student of the Imperial Academy, I purified my mind and, with humility, read the Sovereign’s work. I reflect: no text is more useful than the *Dao De Jing*, yet *Laozi’s* Five Thousand Words are the very essence of Dao and virtue. Though concise, they encompass the vast; though varied, they harmonize. They restore the natural order and govern the present age. Their words are simple, yet their meaning profound—only a Sage could articulate them thus.\n\nSince the Zhou Dynasty, countless scholars have expounded upon it, numbering over a hundred schools, yet most are clouded by their own biases, failing to grasp the True Dao. Their interpretations, though well-intentioned to honor the Sage’s teachings, often contradict them. Only those who deeply enter the Dao and attain divine insight can truly comprehend it.\n\nI reverently observe that the Emperor, taking One as the standard for the world, embracing Unity as the model for all, embodies simplicity and sincerity, extending governance to both humanity and Heaven. The subtleties of the Dao reside inherently in virtue, yet must be spoken and believed, guiding scholars to their rightful path.\n\nThe Sovereign’s learning is profound and complete, like the *Yi Jing* with its *Xici* (系辞), truly the words of a Sage. Yet the Dao, once spoken, cannot be fully perceived by sight or hearing—its application is boundless. How then can I, with limited senses, describe its ineffable depths with finite words? I dare not presume, knowing my understanding falls short.\n\nI have observed how the Emperor’s predecessors, such as the Tang Emperor, composed refined commentaries, and Du Guangting (杜光庭) further expounded with the *Guangsheng Yi* (广圣义). How much less am I, though long instructed, to dare follow in their footsteps? Thus, I humbly offer this commentary, though I know my words are inadequate.\n\n**Jiang Cheng’s Preface**\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* – Scroll One**\n*By Jiang Cheng, Student of the Imperial Academy*\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\n*The Dao* is the shared path of all people.\n*Virtue* is what the heart naturally attains.\n*The Dao* endures through all ages without decay,\nwhile *virtue* fulfills one’s nature and remains constant.\n\nWhen *Laozi* lived in the late Zhou, the Dao declined and virtue waned. Thus, he wrote ninety-nine chapters to illuminate the eternal principles of Dao and virtue, calling it the *Jing* (经). His words are concise, his meaning profound—scholars must meditate deeply to grasp them.\n\n**Jiang Cheng’s Commentary:**\n\nThat all things follow it is called the *Dao*.\nThe *Dao* pervades all existence, yet is not confined—neither the vastness of Heaven and Earth nor the minutiae of an autumn hair escape its embrace. Even within boundaries, nothing exists without it. How much more so for humanity?\n\nMencius said: *\"The Dao is like a great road.\"* Yet the character for *Dao* (道) shares its form with *\"road\"* (道路), for humanity cannot traverse beyond it. Thus, it is clear that the *Dao* is the shared path of all.\n\nThat which the *Dao* embodies within us is called *virtue*.\n*Virtue* in humanity is complete in life and sufficient in allotment. Before form takes shape, it enables existence; it requires no external cultivation nor reliance on others—it is self-derived. What else could it be?\n\nYang Zhu said: *\"Virtue is what one attains.\"* The character for *virtue* (德) derives from *\"straight heart\"* (直心), meaning it is not acquired from others but is self-attained. Thus, *virtue* is what the heart naturally possesses.\n\nMoreover, the *Dao* is boundless while *virtue* is cultivated. Only because the *Dao* is boundless does it remain unchanged through ages, unconstrained by time—ever renewing, never ending. The *Jing* states: *\"The Dao is enduring.\"* This is why it persists through all ages without decay.\n\nOnly because *virtue* is cultivated does it expand the four cardinal virtues, transforming myriad forms without alteration, nurturing and fulfilling them without separation. The *Classics* say: *\"Virtue is the beginning of nature.\"* This is why it perpetually resides within one’s nature.\n\nThe *Dao* has ascents and descents; *virtue* has flourishing and decline. In eras of order, the *Dao* is exalted and *virtue* thrives, while in times of decay, the *Dao* wanes and *virtue* diminishes. By the late Zhou, the Great Dao had faded, and *virtue* further declined, fragmenting into the myriad doctrines of the Hundred Schools, obscured by conflicting theories—neither comprehensive nor pure. Thus, the arts of the *Dao* became divided across the land.\n\n*Laozi*, pitying that the wondrous *Dao* had no successor and that the people remained unaware, took *emptiness* as his principle and *non-action* as his foundation, aligning with the ultimate patterns of nature. He wrote ninety-nine chapters to illuminate the eternal principles of Dao and virtue, so that those who read his words might perceive the completeness of Heaven and Earth and the grand essence of antiquity. This is why his work differs from the Hundred Schools and is called the *Jing*.\n\nFor the *Jing* has a fixed structure, hence it is called *\"constant\"*—like the *Jing* (经) of stars, which adorn the heavens unmoving, or the *Jing* (经) of weaving, which guides the loom without alteration. Thus, it is called the *Jing*.\n\nObserve his work: it encompasses all subtleties, vast and complete, yet contains no more than five thousand words. Its language is concise. One year cannot exhaust its transformations; a lifetime cannot fathom its depths. Its meaning is profound.\n\nThe scholar who merely knows the words yet fails to grasp their meaning, or who attains the meaning yet clings to the words, has not truly understood. The *Yǔ* (语, \"Sayings\") states: *\"Silent reflection reveals its essence.\"* Mencius says: *\"The gentleman cultivates deeply through the Dao, seeking to attain understanding on his own.\"* The eternal principles of Dao and virtue cannot be fully captured by mere speech or shallow perception; only through the heart’s intuition and divine comprehension can one transcend the words and their intent, recognizing the unrecognizable and thus drawing from their profound depths. This is the true essence of this book.\n\nThus, the Sage’s composition begins with the first chapter, expounding the marvels of the Dao to awaken the scholar’s mind, offering the instruction to reflect in silence and cultivate deeply.\n\n**Chapter One: The Dao That Can Be Spoken**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\n\nHuizong’s annotation says: *\"The Dao is without beginning; it cannot be spoken of. When spoken of, it is not the true Dao.\"*\n\nAgain, it says: *\"The Dao cannot be named.\"* Yet the Dao that can be spoken of and named—like the unfolding of seasons or the rise and fall of affairs—responds to what is appropriate, waning and waxing in turn, not an unchanging truth. The eternal Dao and eternal Name are self-originating, self-rooted: before Heaven and Earth existed, they were already fixed and enduring from ancient times. The Lord Fu Xi attained this Dao and sat in the *Shǎoguǎng* (少广, \"Minor Expansion\"). No one knows its beginning, no one knows its end.\n\nThe *Shūyì* (疏义, \"Explanatory Notes\") say: *\"What can be spoken of are the coarse aspects of things.\"* The utmost subtlety of the Dao is far removed from such things, hence it cannot be spoken of.\n\nWhen Confucius saw Wen Bo Xue (温伯雪), his gaze struck and the Dao was preserved—this is why. Zhuangzi recorded the words of the Dao’s beginning: *\"The Dao cannot be spoken of; when spoken of, it is not the true Dao.\"* Is this what is meant?\n\nAt the dawn of creation, there was *wu* (无, \"non-being\") and *you* (有, \"being\"). Non-being had no name; when things formed and their numbers were fixed, then names and perceptions arose. The Dao is not confined by things nor trapped by numbers—when viewed, it cannot be seen. Who could name it? This is what Zhuangzi called *\"the great Dao does not affirm itself.\"*\n\nAgain, it says: *\"The Dao cannot be named.\"* Is this what is meant?\n\nIndeed, the principles of the world have what is *ke* (可, \"affirmable\") yet also what is *buke* (不可, \"unaffirmable\"). When form takes shape, there is what cannot yet be affirmed, and when the pattern emerges, it is both affirmable and unaffirmable, affirmable yet unaffirmable. Things have no fixed appropriateness, affairs no fixed wrongness; the waxing and waning of all things, the flourishing and decline of seasons—spring and summer first, autumn and winter last—each season’s rise and fall, hidden yet manifest, manifest yet hidden, formed then destroyed, destroyed then formed, what was once true now false, what was once discordant now harmonious—all follow the fittingness of the time. When the Dao that can be spoken of and named responds to what is appropriate, waning and waxing in turn, it is not the true eternal Dao.\n\nAlthough names and realities exist, they belong to things; what can be spoken of and perceived grows ever more distant when spoken of. Though the Dao cannot be spoken of, there remains a Dao that is not spoken of; though the Name cannot be named, there remains a Name that is not named. The Dao that is not spoken of is called the *constant Dao*; the Name that is not named is called the *constant Name*.\n\nThe meaning of \"constant\" lies in its enduring completion without change, its permanence through time. The Dao as constant is spoken of in the *Jing*: *\"It stands alone, unaltered.\"* The Name as constant is spoken of in the *Jing*: *\"From ancient times to the present, its name does not fade.\"* Yet things that arise must have their origins and roots, whereas the constant Dao and constant Name have no origins or roots. Things arise from Heaven and Earth, but the constant Dao and constant Name precede Heaven and Earth in their birth.\n\nThough *qi* (气) gathers and scatters, this Dao has no departure or arrival; though forms emerge and perish, this Dao has no existence or annihilation. *\"Self-originating, self-rooted: before Heaven and Earth existed, it was already fixed and enduring from ancient times.\"* Those who attain this Dao ascend to supreme sovereignty, which is why Fu Xi attained it and inherited the *Qi Mu* (气母, \"Mother of Qi\").\n\nThe *Qi Mu* is the origin of *qi*, the primordial source from which all *qi* arises. Attaining it allows one to wander within the *Tai Chu* (太初, \"Supreme Beginning\"), as the *Jing* says: *\"Having known its children, one must then guard its mother.\"* This is the way to eternal life, which is why the Western Sovereign Mother sits in the *Shǎoguǎng*, her beginning unknown, her end unknown.\n\nFor the Dao has no head at its start, no tail at its end. Those who embody the Dao—who could trace its origin? Who could limit its conclusion? The *Jing* says: *\"Having obtained its mother, one knows its children.\"* The Dao is nameless at its beginning, yet it is the mother of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of all things.\n\nHuizong’s annotation says: *\"The Dao is ever nameless, yet Heaven and Earth depend upon it to arise—this is what Zhuangzi called 'generating Heaven and generating Earth.'\"*\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth existed, who could name it? Thus, the nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. With Heaven and Earth, all things then arise, so the named is the mother of all things.\n\nThe *Shūyì* say: *\"The Dao’s utmost subtlety cannot be sought through wisdom nor found through form—though one desires to name it, it cannot be attained.\"* The Dao’s name is a borrowed designation; calling it the Dao is merely a forced naming. This is the Dao hidden within the nameless.\n\n*\"The Dao is ever nameless\"*—this is what is meant. The *Yijing* (易) states: *\"The Great Polarity (太极) gives rise to the Two Principles (两仪).\"* Heaven and Earth are the greatest of formed things, yet formed things arise from the formless. How then do Heaven and Earth arise? It is from the Dao alone, *\"the mother of all beneath the heavens.\"* This is what Zhuangzi called *\"generating Heaven and generating Earth.\"*\n\nThe nameless has no reality—it exists in the void of things. When things coalesce in indistinct unity, before Heaven and Earth arise, it is still void. Thus, before Heaven and Earth existed, who could name it? Though Heaven and Earth are the parents of all things, all things depend upon them to arise. The world has a beginning; calling it the mother of the world means Heaven and Earth depend upon the Dao to manifest.\n\nAll things draw their origin from the Great Primordium (*Buqian* 乾元), yet though their source is vast, they still rely upon it to flourish. All things draw their life from the Supreme Receptivity (*Kunyuan* 坤元), yet though their foundation is profound, they still depend upon it to manifest. When we trace what sustains the singular thread of the One, what substance is it? It is but the Dao alone. This is why it is said, *\"Only after Heaven and Earth arise do all things come into being.\"* This is the Dao made manifest in named existence.\n\nThe Dao is singular in essence. When gathered, it forms substance; when dispersed, it marks the beginning. From its original source, it remains hidden in the Nameless—this is called the Beginning. From its manifestation, it appears in the Named—this is called the Mother. Though the terms differ, their root is one.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth mark the Beginning, today’s scholars recognize this. If one truly perceives the Dao, then even before Heaven and Earth existed, their origin could be known. This is how the Sage knows Heaven and Earth’s Beginning *after* their existence.\n\nTo observe its subtlety, one must remain in the Constant Void;\nTo grasp its breadth, one must embrace the Constant Manifest.\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: Zhuangzi said, *\"Establish it in the Constant Void.\"* To erect nothing is the Constant Void. To discard nothing is the Constant Manifest. The Constant Void lies in principle—its upper reaches are unfathomable, the essence of all beneath the heavens, hence its subtlety is observed. The Constant Manifest lies in affairs—its lower reaches are boundless, the transformation of all beneath the heavens, hence its breadth is grasped.\n\nThe realms of Having and Not-Having intertwine, where subtlety and breadth reside. Great wisdom unites both perspectives, leaving nothing unattainable. In the hazy and indistinct, there are forms and things. Small wisdom clings to one-sidedness, blinded by partiality, abandoning the Manifest for the Void, or the Void for the Manifest, neglecting the root for the branches—thus the Dao is fractured for all beneath the heavens.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: Without motion, there is generation of the Manifest—this is its utility. When the Manifest reaches its limit, it returns to the Void—this is its function. The Manifest does not depart from the Void, so the Void is not truly Void. The Void does not abandon the Manifest, so the Manifest is not truly Manifest. To establish it in the Constant Void is to affirm the Void that is not Void. To establish it in the Constant Manifest is to affirm the Manifest that is not Manifest. Though transformations are boundless, their foundation remains unchanging—this is why it is called Constant.\n\nZhuangzi expounds Laozi’s teachings: *\"Establish it in the Constant Void.\"* Yet his text begins with this very principle, deeply grasping the logic of Having and Not-Having. Thus, when purifying away all things, even sage wisdom, righteousness, and propriety would be discarded—this is the Constant Void. When establishing all laws, even affairs, forms, and names would be preserved—this is the Constant Manifest. The Constant Void in principle has never given rise to things; hidden and difficult to know, even divine vision cannot perceive its form. Hence, its upper reaches are unfathomable, revealing the small yet subtle—entering the divine through its minuteness, thus becoming the essence of all beneath the heavens. The Constant Manifest in affairs encompasses all virtues; evident and easily seen, it is manifest yet concealed. Hence, its lower reaches are not obscured, revealing the great yet broad—emerging from clarity and vastness, thus becoming the transformation of all beneath the heavens.\n\nConfucius composed the *Yijing*. When about to act or move, he spoke of nothing finer than the essence of all beneath the heavens—this is because from the Void to the Manifest, principle dictates so. In the arrangement of trigrams and their transformations, he spoke of nothing broader than the transformation of all beneath the heavens—this is because gathering the Manifest into the Void, affairs dictate so.\n\nThe Constant Void and Constant Manifest arise from the same source; the utmost subtlety and transformation stem from the same divine origin. Though their names differ, their principle is one.\n\nThough Having and Not-Having are unified, their utility and application shift—\nIn the Manifest, they are concealed; in the Void, they are revealed.\nCalled subtle, called wondrous—merely their dwelling place.\n\nOnly great wisdom, viewing near and far, knows that the root of the Manifest is not truly Manifest—\nThose who cling to it as Manifest still harbor the Void within.\nKnows that the Void is not truly Void—\nThose who reject it as Void still contain the Manifest.\n\nIn the hazy and indistinct, forms are visible;\nIn the indistinct and hazy, things coalesce indistinctly.\n\nThe obscure interplay of Having and Not-Having—\nWhen observed through the Dao, all is exhausted,\nAnd the whole becomes one, leaving nothing unattainable.\n\nCommon folk, bound by small wisdom, are blind to the great principle.\nSome, obscured by the Dao’s stillness, discard the Manifest for the Void,\nDrowning in seclusion, taking the non-Void as Void;\nSome, lost in the Dao’s motion, cling to superficiality,\nNeglecting the root for the branches, entangled in forms,\nTaking the non-Manifest as Manifest;\nOr making nothingness the way, fixated on one aspect—\nA hundred schools, each boasting their strengths.\nThus the Dao is fractured for all beneath the heavens.\n\nThese two—though differing in name, they share the same origin—\nBoth are called the Mysterious.\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: The Dao is formless—\nWho can grasp its breadth and subtlety?\nThings and self share the same root;\nRight and wrong arise from the same *qi*—\nThus they are both called the Mysterious.\n\nThe deluded of the world seek falsehood for truth,\nMoving farther from truth, unaware that\nHaving and Not-Having are but differing names.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: The true origin is singular and complete,\nWithout form yet encompassing all—\nThe form of the formless, exhausting the boundless.\nOnly breadth and subtlety are indistinct, without division.\nThus the Dao is formless—\nWho can grasp its breadth and subtlety?\n\nFrom the Dao descending, distinctions arise.\nThe ignorant, clinging to self and objects, give rise to the illusion of self and other.\nThis is that, and that is this—\nYet from the indistinct emergence of *qi*, *qi* is singular.\nThus, things and self share the same root;\nRight and wrong arise from the same *qi*—\nConverging all differences into one origin—\nWho is truly Having, who truly Not-Having?\n\nThus, the same is called *Xuan* [玄].\nThe confused of the world take the *wu* [無] for true and the *you* [有] for delusion,\nGathering delusion to seek truth, moving farther from truth—\nYet they fail to know that *wu* is the subtle *you*, and *you* is the true *wu*.\nNames are contrary, yet their essence harmonizes.\n\n*Xuan* again *xuan*—the gateway to all subtleties.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation says: The *Suwen* [素问] states: *Xuan* gives birth to the numinous.\nThe *Yijing* [易] says: The numinous—\nThis is the subtle speech that encompasses all things.\n\nTo refine subtlety to its utmost is *xuan*.\n*Xuan* is the color of Heaven.\nWhat is colored by color is manifest,\nYet the coloring itself is never fully revealed.\n*Xuan* again *xuan*—this is what is meant by \"coloring.\"\n\nThe subtle principles of *xuan* pervade all things:\nHeaven’s movement, Earth’s repose, humanity’s vitality,\nThe flourishing of all creatures—\nAll are subtle, all emerging from *xuan*.\nThus it is called the gateway to all subtleties.\n\nConfucius composed the *Yijing*, only reaching the *Shuogua* [说卦] to speak of subtlety,\nWhile Laozi placed this at the beginning of his work.\nThe sages’ words complement each other as end and beginning.\n\nThe *Cushui* [疏义] says:\nWind generates wood, wood generates the liver,\nIn Heaven it is *xuan*, in humanity it is the Dao.\nThe Dao generates *yi* [一], thus the Dao descends and emerges,\nEmerging to generate wisdom.\n*Yi* generates *er* [二], thus *xuan* ascends and enters,\nEntering to generate the numinous.\n\nThe numinous in its function—\nBoundless, formless, pervasive without end,\nLight and clear as Heaven, relying on it to move,\nHeavy and turbid as Earth, relying on it to rest,\nThe harmonious *qi* of *Kun* [坤], relying on it to be vital—\nDown to all creatures thriving in their roles,\nAll rely on this to flourish.\nThus, what subtly encompasses all things is none other than the numinous,\nAnd what generates the numinous originates from *xuan*—\nHence it is the gateway to all subtleties.\n\nTruly, when it emerges, it is vast and red;\nWhen it enters, it is small and *xuan*.\nSmall and subtle—this is *xuan*,\nBecause it enters and becomes small.\n\nIf we speak of *xuan* virtue—\nIt is virtue entering and becoming small.\nIf we speak of *xuan* darkness—\nIt is entering into darkness and becoming small.\nThough *xuan* is small, it remains subtle,\nYet it has not yet departed from color—\nAs the *Yijing* says: \"Heaven is *xuan*, Earth is yellow,\"\nAnd Zhuangzi says: \"The *xuan* sky.\"\nThus, *xuan* as color has red and black—\nRed for *yang*, black for *yin*.\nAll things bear *yin* and embrace *yang*,\nYet *xuan* can be *yin* and can be *yang*—\nThen what is confined to *yin* and *yang*?\nCan it truly transcend this?\nMuch less *xuan* itself!\n\nWhat constitutes *xuan* is *xuan* again *xuan*—\nAs the *Liezi* [列子] says: \"Coloring.\"\n\nAll things emerge yet their gateway is unseen—\nIt lies here.\n\nAlthough Confucius composed the *Yijing*, only reaching the *Shuogua* to speak of subtlety,\nWhile Laozi placed this at the beginning of his work—\nThe *Yijing*, from exhausting principles to fulfilling nature and destiny,\nIs a sequence of entering the Dao through speech,\nAnd returning function to essence.\nLaozi’s work, with returning to the root and restoring destiny as its priority,\nIs a sudden manifestation of the Dao in action,\nShowing that the numinous arises from essence in function.\nThe *Yijing* uses symbols and numbers, Laozi uses *you* and *wu* to demonstrate *xuan*—\nThough their words differ, they complement each other as beginning and end.\nThough their teachings seem disjointed, their essence is one.\n\n**Chapter Two: All Under Heaven Know**\n\nAll under Heaven know beauty when it is beautiful—then ugliness arises;\nAll know goodness when it is good—then not-goodness arises.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nThe Dao has no differing forms—who is beautiful or ugly?\nNature is inherently unified—who is good or bad?\nThere is beauty, and ugliness is its opposite,\nThus it is said: All under Heaven know beauty when it is beautiful—then ugliness arises.\nThere is goodness, and not-goodness is its opposite,\nThus it is said: All know goodness when it is good—then not-goodness arises.\n\nWhat the world deems beautiful is the numinous and strange,\nWhat it deems ugly is the stinking and rotten.\nThe numinous and strange transform into the stinking and rotten,\nThe stinking and rotten transform into the numinous and strange—\nThen how can beauty and ugliness be distinguished?\n\nWhat was once right may later be wrong,\nWhat is now discarded may later be used—\nThen how can good and not-good be chosen?\n\nThe sage embodies the true *wu* while constantly *you*,\nManifests subtle function while constantly *wu*—\nBeauty and ugliness, good and not-good,\nAre to be simplified yet cannot be grasped—\nHow then can ugliness and not-goodness burden?\n\nThe *Cushui* says:\nUnder Heaven, there is no second Dao.\nFrom their unity, the names of beauty and ugliness vanish,\nOne nature without nature—\nFrom their origin, the distinctions of good and evil do not stand.\nYet there is high and low, with the latter as its subordinate,\nThus there is beauty with ugliness as its opposite,\nThere is left and right, with the latter as its subordinate,\nThus there is good with not-good as its opposite.\n\nTo have one without the other is to desire *yin* without *yang*—\nHow can this be achieved?\n\nThe people of the world know one aspect yet not the other,\nTaking the numinous and strange as beautiful,\nThe stinking and rotten as ugly,\nYet beauty and ugliness fill the heart—\nThis is deemed right, that is deemed wrong,\nAnd good and not-good oppose each other.\n\nYet they fail to know that Great Transformation is unceasing,\nInstantly shifting—\nThe straight becomes strange, the good becomes ominous,\nThe stinking and rotten, the numinous and strange—\nAlternating, transforming.\nInitially, there is no beauty or ugliness,\nPrinciple has no constant right,\nAffairs have no constant wrong—\nSometimes right, sometimes wrong,\nGained then lost.\nInitially, there is no good or not-good,\nLife and death, giving and taking—\nAlso divided, also successive—\nHow can one judge them as different?\n\nOnly the sage awakens to this and merges into the mysterious,\nExhausts the truth of things while guarding their root,\nCommands the transformation of things while guarding their origin—\nThough *wuwei*, yet not neglectful of action,\nEmbodying true *wu* while constantly *you*,\nThough engaged in affairs, yet emerging from non-action,\nManifesting subtle function while constantly *wu*.\nThus, extinguishing preferences in unity,\nAnd entrusting right and wrong to the two processes.\n\nThe beautiful is beautiful of itself—I do not know it as beautiful;\nThe ugly is ugly of itself—I do not know it as ugly.\nThe good, I affirm as good;\nThe not-good, I also affirm as good.\nStrange and wondrous, the Dao flows as one—\nThough one might seek to simplify it, it cannot be done.\nThen how can evil and not-good weigh me down?\n\nThus, the arising of having from non-being,\nThe completion of easy from difficult,\nThe contrast of long and short,\nThe tilt of high and low,\nThe harmony of sound and response,\nThe succession of before and after.\n\n**Commentary by Emperor Huizong:**\nBefore the *Taiyi* was differentiated, all phenomena were of one body.\nOnce the Two Principles emerged, all things became paired opposites.\nThese six pairs—\nWhere myriad transformations intersect,\nWhere myriad thoughts arise,\nWhere divergent paths begin—\nAre the snares by which the world is ensnared and cannot escape.\n\nNon-being generates being, being returns to non-being—\nThus it is said: *having and non-being generate each other.*\nThere is difficulty in crossing perilous terrain,\nYet one knows the ease of traversing level ground—\nThus it is said: *difficult and easy complete each other.*\nLong and short contrast, as with inches and feet.\nHigh and low tilt against each other, as with mountains and marshes.\nSound strikes and echo responds—\nThus it is said: *sound and response harmonize.*\nForm moves and shadow follows—\nThus it is said: *before and after succeed each other.*\n\nThe movement of yin and yang,\nThe progression of the four seasons,\nThe principles of all things—\nInstantly formed, then instantly dissolved.\nIts difficulty is like *wuwei* governing the world;\nIts ease is like *wuwei* aligning with nature.\n\nThat which is long by nature cannot be severed,\nThat which is short by nature cannot be extended.\nThe sky’s height is not contrived—*the Dao’s own elevation;*\nThe earth’s depth is not imposed—*the Dao’s own descent.*\n\n**Explanatory Notes:**\nBefore the *Taiyi*, the One Qi was undifferentiated,\nA complete yet formless whole, undivided and indistinct—\nThus all phenomena were of one body.\nThe *Yijing* speaks of the *Taiji*, from which the Two Principles arise.\nThe Dao stands between opposites, giving rise to paired dependencies—\nThus all things become paired opposites.\n\nThe True Constant disperses into myriad transformations,\nUnity divides into myriad thoughts,\nSame origins diverge into varied paths—\nNone escape these six pairs.\n\nThus, when extended to the southeast, there is non-being generating being;\nWhen contracted to the northwest, being reaches its limit and returns to non-being.\nOne and non-one cycle like this—*having and non-being generate each other.*\n\nWhat is first difficult must later become easy;\nWhat is first easy must later become difficult.\nTo encounter perilous difficulty,\nOne knows the ease of traversing level ground—\nThus difficulty and ease contrast like this.\n\nStretch out a finger to measure an inch,\nStretch out a hand to measure a foot—\nWithout the length of the foot,\nOne could not perceive the shortness of the inch—\nThis is *long and short contrasting each other.*\nMountains are steep and lean, marshes are fat and low—\nWithout the height of the mountains,\nOne could not perceive the depth of the marshes—\nThis is *high and low tilting each other.*\n\nSound strikes without generating sound, yet generates echo—\nThus sound strikes and echo responds—\nThis is *sound and response harmonizing.*\nForm moves without generating form, yet generates shadow—\nThus form moves and shadow follows—\nThis is *before and after succeeding each other.*\n\nIn their principles and their affairs,\nTheir forms and their patterns,\nTheir sounds and their numbers—\nDivided into yin and yang,\nArranged into the four seasons,\nDispersed into myriad things—\nNone escape these six pairs.\n\nInstantly formed, they arise from non-being;\nInstantly dissolved, they do not endure.\nApplied to human affairs, one knows *wuwei* is not easy;\nRetreating into obscurity, one knows *wuwei* is not difficult.\n\nAscending heights does not make one long—\nLong is not excess, and innate long cannot be severed;\nDescending lows does not make one short—\nShort is not deficiency, and innate short cannot be extended.\nThe sky’s elevation is not contrived—*the Dao’s own nature;*\nThe earth’s depth is not imposed—*the Dao’s own nature.*\n\nThe **Dao** manifests through resonance and rhythm—\nThen some are **official pitches**, some are **angle pitches**, following the drum’s movement.\n\nIn their ordered sequence and inherent logic,\nThe four seasons, long and short, each maintain their proper ranks.\n\nAll that enters the realm of **opposition and correspondence**—\nThough all are the **Dao’s** abode,\nThey stray far from the **Dao** itself.\n\nThus the **sage** dwells in **non-action’s** affairs,\nPractices **non-speech’s** teaching.\n\n*Emperor Huizong’s annotation*: Dwelling in **non-action’s** affairs is what *Zhuangzi* calls \"employing the world without contriving.\" Practicing **non-speech’s** teaching is what the *I Ching* calls \"teaching through the **Dao’s** divine course, so the world submits.\"\n\nTo act brings **completion and deficiency**;\nTo speak brings **rightness and error**.\nYet never free from entanglement—\nHow could the **sage** stand alone above all things,\nTransforming all things while none could burden them?\n\n*Explanatory commentary*: What must be done yet concealed is **affairs**.\n**Non-action’s** affairs mean action arises from **non-action**—\nThis is the so-called \"employing the world without contriving.\"\n\nIndeed, to employ the world is already to engage in **affairs**.\nOnly rooted in **non-action** does one act without touching **contrivance’s** edge.\nThus **Shun’s** inaction—\nHis decrees issued, yet all things flourished, attaining this.\n\n**Cultivating the Dao** is what **teaching** means.\n**Non-speech’s** teaching is through **personal example**, so people follow—\nThis is the so-called \"teaching through the **Dao’s** divine course, so the world submits.\"\n\nIndeed, to establish **teaching** is already to engage with things,\nBut when it springs from **divine Dao**, though **teaching** is given, the intent of speech is never uttered.\nThus **Wang Xi’s** upright stillness, never teaching, never deliberating—\nHe attained this.\n\nMoreover, **non-action** is genuine,\n**Action** is artifice.\nIf one labors in **affairs** and entangles in **human contrivance**,\nHow could there be **completion** without **deficiency**?\n\nThe wise do not speak,\nThose who speak lack wisdom.\nThe **superior** speaks to the **inferior**, the **inferior** is taught—\nForcing instruction without pause,\nOne cannot avoid **rightness and error**.\n\nThe **sage** dawns and perceives **singularity**,\nEmbodies the **Dao’s** non-existence,\nResponds to things while remaining in **non-being**.\nIn **affairs**, **non-action** yet **completion**;\nIn **teaching**, **non-speech** yet hearts delight.\nThough myriad things fill the world,\nThey cannot prick his mind—\nHow could the **six pairs** burden him?\n\nAll things arise yet do not cling,\nAre born yet do not possess,\nAct yet do not rely,\n**Completion** achieved yet not claimed.\nOnly because he does not claim,\nThus he does not depart.\n\n*Emperor Huizong’s annotation*: All things arise together,\nResponding to stimuli like a mirror reflecting forms—\nBeauty and ugliness fully revealed.\nLike valleys echoing sounds,\nGood and bad all respond—\nNo refusal exists.\nHence it is said: \"Arise yet do not cling.\"\n\nThey form and transform themselves,\nAre born and colored by their own nature—\nEach reaching their utmost height and grandeur,\nFulfilling their **innate essence**—\nWho could possess them?\nHence it is said: \"Are born yet do not possess.\"\n\nOrdering all things yet not **perverse**,\nNurturing across ages yet not **benevolent**,\nCovering heaven and earth,\nCarving myriad forms—\nYet not **crafty**,\nHence it is said: \"Act yet do not rely.\"\n\nThe **Dao’s** course in the four seasons—\nWhen one **completes**, the other **retires**,\nHeaven’s **Dao** indeed.\nThe **sage** embodies it,\nThus his **power** surpasses the world yet seems not of himself—\nIf he claims it, then he is already bewildered.\nHence it is said: \"**Completion** achieved yet not claimed.\"\n\nTo claim brings **departure**—\nAncient and modern alike.\nNo claiming within himself,\nThings cannot alter him.\nFitting to the **coming** is **timely**,\nFitting to the **going** is **orderly**—\nWhat harm or gain could there be?\nHence it is said: \"Only because he does not claim,\nThus he does not depart.\"\n\n*Explanatory commentary*: With a single body facing the **myriad movements**,\nWith a single mind bearing the **world’s** demands—\nThings may take from him,\nYet he remains **unperturbed**;\n**Affairs** may press upon him,\nYet he remains **unmoved**.\nLike a mirror responding yet not storing,\nLike a valley empty yet able to receive—\nBeauty and ugliness, good and bad—\nNo refusal exists.\nIf so, then his **universal response** and **harmonious fulfillment**\nAre indeed abundant.\n\nIf he were to **flee** the **myriad** and **pursue** stillness,\nFearful of **excess** and **deficiency**,\nThen how would things **open**?\nHow would **affairs** be **completed**?\nHow would the world **depend** on him?\nThis is called: \"All things arise yet do not cling.\"\n\nSelf-formed, self-transformed,\nYet **endless generation and transformation**—\nThey do not **hoard** their **power**.\nSelf-shaped, self-colored,\nYet **myriad forms and hues**—\nThey do not **monopolize** their **completion**.\nThose with **form** exert themselves through **form**,\nThose with **essence** fulfill themselves through **essence**—\nIf he claims them, then he is already bewildered.\nThis is called: \"Are born yet do not possess.\"\n\nThe **sage** responds to the world with **non-being** alone—\nHis ordering of all things is not from a **mind** of ordering.\nLike **autumn’s** killing yet gentle in its severity,\nThus he kills yet none resent him.\nHis nurturing across ages is not from a **mind** of nurturing—\nLike **spring’s** warmth yet granting **enlightenment** to all,\nThus his **virtue** extends to ages yet he does not **love** humanity.\n\nHeaven covers without exclusion,\nI have the **Dao** to cover what it covers;\nEarth bears without rejection,\nI have the **Dao** to bear what it bears.\nThough a **yellow reed’s** stalk is slender,\nIf given **support and branches**, it thrives;\nThough a **caterpillar’s** body is minute,\nIf given **uplift and wings**, it ascends.\nThough not **carved** or **sculpted** by hand,\nThey rely on **Dao’s** transformation,\nNot on **crafty cleverness**—\nIf **carving** and **sculpting** myriad forms,\nCould this be the **crafty cleverness’** domain?\n\nOrdering all things,\nNurturing across ages,\nCovering heaven and earth,\nCarving myriad forms—\nYet not **perverse**,\nNot **benevolent**,\nNot **crafty**,\nThen it is **non-action** yet **completion**,\nNot relying on its **achievement**.\nThis is called: \"Act yet do not rely.\"\n\nThe four seasons differ in **qi**,\nYet their **Dao’s** course knows no halt—\n**Steel** emerges, **Fire** withdraws;\n**Wood** flourishes, **Water** decays.\nThey **consume** and **supplement** each other,\n**Fill** and **empty** in turn—\nPassing yet leaving no trace,\nHeaven’s **Dao** has already **completed** its course.\n\nThe **sage** follows Heaven as his **tutor**,\nSo vast that none can name him,\nYet so towering that his **power** is **achieved**.\nThough he has no **intent** to establish **power**,\nThe world **attributes** it to him.\n\n「When he departs from **achievement** and **renown**,\nReturns them to the people,\nAnd does not consider them as his own private share—\nHow could he take them as real and fixed possessions?\nThis is called: **\"Achievement without clinging.\"**\n\nThe **lamp’s** light is set in its **stand**,\nYet the flame before is not the flame behind;\nIts brilliance is borrowed from the **mirror**,\nYet the form now is not the form of old.\nWhat is past becomes **ancient**,\nWhat is present becomes **present**—\nBefore the thought has fully formed,\nThe so-called \"present\" has already shifted to become the **ancient**.\nTo cling to the **having** is to invite the **losing**;\nFor the **spirit** is bodiless and does not cling—\nOnly when it takes **form** does it cling to the people.\nThus, the **sage** holds fast to the **spirit**,\nUnshaken by **things**,\nSo within himself there is no clinging,\nAnd **things** cannot alter him.\nHe does not bind himself to the **future**,\nYet knows when the **future** arrives;\nHe does not linger on the **past**,\nYet knows when the **past** departs in order.\nWhat need is there for gain or loss?\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"Only by not clinging does one not lose.\"*\n\n**Chapter Three: Not Exalting Virtue**\n\nNot exalting the **virtuous**,\nSo the people do not contend;\nNot treasuring **hard-to-obtain goods**,\nSo the people do not become thieves.\n\nThe **Emperor Xuan** annotated:\n*\"To exalt the virtuous leads to excessive knowledge,\nTo the point where

people dig holes in broad daylight to steal.\"*\n\nNot exalting the **virtuous**,\nThen the people each settle into their **fate**,\nAnd have nothing to **boast** or **strive** for,\nHence they do not contend.\n\nNot treasuring **goods**,\nThen the people each content themselves with their **fate’s** provisions,\nAnd have no **covetous** schemes,\nHence they do not become thieves.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said:\n*\"To curtail the deeds of the **Record-Keepers** (曾史),\nAnd to gag the mouths of **Yang** and **Mo**,\nThen the world’s **virtue** begins to return to **harmony**.\"*\n\nThe *Traveling to the South* chapter states:\n*\"Do not treasure rare **things**,\nUse common **things** with humility,\nThen the people will be content.\"*\n\nThe **Explanatory Notes** say:\n*\"Exalting means distinguishing and favoring.\nIf the virtuous are exalted, then the foolish and the wise will deceive one another,\nThe good and the bad will contradict each other—\nThe people will first be confused and chaotic,\nTo the point where the world is thrown into chaos,\nAnd Confucians and Mohists all rise up in contention—\nThis is what is meant by: 'To promote the virtuous leads to the people trampling one another.'\"*\n\n*\"Treasure means to value and seek.\nIf goods are treasured, then the hearts of envy and longing arise,\nAnd the yearning for what is lacking spreads—\nSeeing **gain**, they forget **form**;\nSeeing **profit**, they forget **truth**—\nTo the point where thieves operate even at midday,\nAnd people dig holes in broad daylight to steal—\nThis is what is meant by: 'Hard-to-obtain goods cause people to act recklessly.'\"*\n\nOnly by not exalting the **virtuous**,\nThen the **loyal** is truly **loyal** without knowing it,\nThe **faithful** is truly **faithful** without knowing it—\nThe people each settle into their **fate**,\nWho would dare to **suppress** their own nature for the sake of **boasting**,\nOr to **act** improperly to **strut**?\nEach halts at

\"not **disturbed**,\"\n**Mencius’s** \"heart does not **move**\"—\nThey attained this.»\n\nThus the **Daoist Sage’s** governance:\n**Empty** the heart, **fill** the belly,\n**Weaken** the will, **strengthen** the bones,\nEver keep the people **ignorant**, **desireless**.\n\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*\"Grain responds because it is empty,\nA mirror reflects because it is empty,\nA tube receives because it is empty,\nEars hear because they are empty,\nEyes see because they are empty,\nThe nose smells because it is empty.\nIf filled within, there is obstruction here.\nThe Sage, compelled to govern the world,\nViews all equally as one,\nNears the close and lifts the distant,\nFollows what is natural, lets it unfold—\nWhat need for deliberation?\nWhen **Emperor Yao** raised **Shun** and used **Gun**,\nHe nearly achieved this.*\n\nAn **empty** heart hears all impartially, without favor or aversion;\nA **filled** belly suffices in contentment, without grasping or demand—\nWhy praise the **virtuous**? Why value wealth?\n\nThe Sage acts for the belly, not the eyes;\nThe belly, unselective, contains all.\n\nThe will follows where the heart directs;\nThe bones are the body’s foundation.\nA **strong** will may sacrifice itself for fame without rest,\nOr chase wealth without satisfaction,\nOr boast of deeds, or pride in skill—\nThe farther from the **Way**, the worse.\n**Weak** bones scatter the steps, clash with things,\nAre worn down, sink without return.\nThe Sage’s will is ever **low**,\nYet people exalt it;\nEver **last**,\nYet people honor it first.\nKnowing **masculine**, he guards **feminine**;\nKnowing **glory**, he embraces **humiliation**—\nThis is **weakening** the will.\n**Uprightness** halts it—\nNo thing can displace it.\n**Firmness** grasps it—\nNo change can topple it.\nUnbroken, like **Master Guangcheng**,\nLiving twelve hundred years without decay—\nThis is **strengthening** the bones.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said:\n*\"In harmony with **non-knowing**, virtue does not depart;\nIn harmony with **non-desire**, this is called **primordial simplicity**.\n**Primordial simplicity**—then the people’s nature is preserved.\nThe Sage’s governance seeks only that the people retain their nature.\nExcessive knowledge harms the **allocation of life’s essence**,\nExcessive desire drowns the **flow of life’s vitality**—\nCalled ‘governance,’ yet what chaos exceeds this?\nThus, ever keep the people **ignorant**, **desireless**.\"*\n\n**Cushioning the Interpretation** says:\n*\"A house with no vacancy invites strife between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law;\nA heart without **heavenly wandering** invites the six desires to contend—\nThus the ancients valued **emptiness** so greatly.\nFrom the external world, like grain’s response,\nA mirror’s reflection, a tube’s reception;\nFrom within, like ears hearing, eyes seeing, noses smelling—\nAll because of **emptiness**.\n**Emptiness** is the opposite of **fullness**;\n**Fullness** brings obstruction,\n**Emptiness** brings no gap.\nWithin the myriad things, within the self—\nIf **fullness** fills the core,\nObstruction arises here,\nBecause it cannot be without gaps.\nThe Sage, compelled to govern the world,\nWith boundless, impartial love,\nViews all as one—\nExtends this to that,\nNears the close, lifts the distant,\nFollows what is natural,\nMakes no distinctions,\nLets it unfold naturally—\nNo taking, no discarding,\nAbandons all burdens, merges with **non-being**—\nWhat need for deliberation?\nThough **Shun** was wise and cultured,\n**Yao** was not unaware—\nHe waited for **Shun’s** virtue to be recognized before raising him.\nThough **Gun** was doomed to exile,\n**Yao** was not ignorant—\nHe also used him provisionally, as the crowd demanded.\nThe Sage has no fixed will;\nHe takes the **Way** as his will—\nThus **Shun** could not but be raised,\n**Gun** could not but be used.\nWhy?\n**Emptiness** is not **nothingness**,\nBut the absence of **fullness**.\nThe heart contains all things,\nYet what it intends is not;\n**Fullness** contains nothing,\nYet what it intends is not—\nThus the heart is fundamentally **empty**.\nOnly when the heart’s essence is exhausted,\nAnd governance reaches its **emptiness**,\nDoes the Sage say:\n‘The good, I approve;\nThe unvirtuous, I also approve,’\nListening impartially, observing without bias—\nWhy praise the **virtuous**?\nThose who focus inward find sufficiency in the self;\nThose who roam outward seek completeness in things.\nSeeking completeness in things brings constant fear of lack;\nFinding sufficiency in the self raises no envy.\nThe Sage does not covet wealth or rare goods,\nFor he finds sufficiency in the self and fills the belly.\nWhen the belly is filled,\nHe withdraws vision, reverses hearing,\nGuards the spirit within—\nThus contentment is stable, without grasping—\nWhy value wealth?\nThe will resides in the heart—\nThus the will is where the heart directs.\nThe form stands on the bones—\nThus the bones are the body’s foundation.\nIf the will is **strong** and not **weakened**,\nIt takes **display** as right.\nSome sacrifice for fame without rest,\nSome pursue wealth without satisfaction,\nSome boast of deeds yet achieve nothing,\nSome pride themselves yet grow no wiser—\nTheir distance from the **Way** is great—\nThus the will must be **weakened**.\nIf the bones are **weak** and not **strengthened**,\nSteps scatter, the center has no anchor,\nClashing with things, worn down, sinking without return—\nDrifting, lost, knowing not where to turn—\nHow could they stand firm?\nThus the bones must be **strengthened**.\nThe Sage’s use of will:\nLow to tend himself,\nEver **last**,\nYet people honor him first.\nKnowing **masculine**, he guards **feminine**—\nNo thing can overcome him;\nKnowing **glory**, he embraces **humiliation**—\nNo thing can soil him.\n**Weakening** the will:\n**Uprightness** halts it—\nNo thing can displace it;\n**Firmness** grasps it—\nNo change can topple it.\nDeep-rooted, unbroken—\nLong life, enduring vision—\nUnchanging with **Heaven and Earth**,\nLike **Master Guangcheng** nurturing his **form**,\nLiving twelve hundred years without decay—\nThis is **strengthening** the bones.\nExcessive knowledge brings ruin—\nThus the people must be kept **ignorant**.\"*\n\n「Nurturing the heart finds no better method than **cultivating few desires**—\nThus the Sage makes the people desireless.\n\nIn harmony with **ignorance**,\nTheir **virtue** becomes as thick as that of an infant,\nAnd such **virtue** will not depart.\n\nIn harmony with few desires,\nThey reveal their **innate simplicity** and **embrace natural purity**—\nLittle private interest, few desires,\nThis is called **innate simplicity** and **natural purity**.\n\n**Simplicity** means no admixture,\n**Purity** means no dissipation—\n**Simplicity** and **Purity** restore the people’s true nature.\n\nThe Sage’s

**not true**.\n\nOnly when **action** does not **depart** from **non-action**,\nAnd **non-action** does not **neglect** action,\nWith **action arising** from **non-action**,\nThen there is **ample room** for governing the world.\nHow could it be that He **abandons** the people and **severes** all things,\nAnd suddenly **establishes** Himself in a realm of **no affairs**?\n\nNow, the realm **above form** is called **Dao**,\nFrom **Dao** descending,\nNothing **escapes** the realm of **things**—\nThus the **variations** of all things lie in the realm of **form and below**.\n\nOnly when

**observe** their **return**.”\n\nAnd as **Yang Zhu** said:\n“The ruler **completes** the **transformations** of **Heaven and Earth**.”\n\nThus, **looking upward** to **Heaven**,\nOne sees **swelling

of Dao and Virtue, Volume Two begins.*\n\n「The **Daoist scholar** Jiang Cheng’s **Explanatory Commentary**\n**Chapter Four: The Supreme Purity of the Dao**\n\nWhen the Dao is **supreme in purity** yet applied,\nIt is **never overfull**—\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation** says:\n“The Dao has **sentience** and **trustworthiness**,\nThus it has **application**.\nWithout **action** and without **form**,\nIt is **never overfull**.”\n\nThe *Classic* states:\n“All things bear **yin** and embrace **yang**,\n**Supreme qi** brings them into **harmony**.”\n\nThe **principles** of all things:\nIf they **lean toward yang**, they become **excessively strong**,\nOr **err through excess**.\nIf they **lean toward yin**, they become **weak**,\nOr **err through deficiency**.\n\nNeither **excess** nor **deficiency**—\nThis is called **supreme qi**.\n**Supreme qi** is **the middle**,\nThus it is called **great harmony**.\n\nThe **high** are **checked**,\nThe **low** are **raised**,\nThose with **excess** are **taken from**,\nThose with **deficiency** are **given to**—\nThe Dao’s **application**,\n**Nothing** escapes without attaining **its middle**.\n\n**Pouring** from it, **never full**,\n**Measuring** from it, **never exhausted**—\nThe more one **takes** for others, the more one **owns**,\nThe more one **gives** to others, the more one **possesses**,\nThe Dao’s **essence**,\nLike the **Great Void**, envelops the **six extremes**,\nHow could it **be overfull**?\n\nThe **Explanatory Commentary** states:\n“The Dao can **be transmitted** yet cannot **be received**—\nBecause it can **be transmitted**, there is **sentience** and **trustworthiness**,\nThus there is **application**.\nA **single thread’s** subtlety,\nIf **nurtured** to **flourish**—\nIs this not **sentience**?\nA **dragonfly’s** minuteness,\nIf **supported** to **take wing**—\nIs this not **sentience**?\n**Cold and heat** **await** it to **come and go**,\nYet it **does not force** the **seasons**—\nIs this not **trustworthiness**?\nAll things **await** it to **generate and grow**,\nYet each **follows** its **kind**—\nIs this not **trustworthiness**?\n\nBecause it cannot **be received**,\nIt **acts without action** and **forms without form**,\nThus it is **never overfull**.\n\n**Deep** in its **dwelling** yet **serene** and **unshaken**,\n**Floating** in its **clarity** yet **tranquil** and **unstirred**—\nIs this not **acting without action**?\n\n**Dim** and **silent**, **hidden** and **mysterious**,\n**Seized** yet **not obtained**—\nIs this not **forming without form**?\n\nThe *Classic* states:\n“All things bear **yin** and embrace **yang**,\n**Supreme qi** brings them into **harmony**.”\n\n**Yin** **halts** and **becomes still**,\nAll things **bear** it.\n**Yang** **melts** and **becomes smooth**,\nAll things **embrace** it.\n\nIf one **follows Heaven** yet lacks **Earth**,\nIt **leans toward yang** and **errs through excess**.\nIf one **follows Earth** yet lacks **Heaven**,\nIt **leans toward yin** and **errs through deficiency**.\n\nThere must be **the middle of yin and yang**,\n**Excessively strong** yet **not erring through excess**,\n**Weak** yet **not erring through deficiency**—\nThis is **supreme qi**.\n\nThe **nature** of **supreme qi**,\n**Heaven One** is its **root**,\n**Heaven Five** is its **middle**—\nThus **Kun** is **the middle**,\n**The middle** **connects above and below**,\nThis is called **great harmony**,\nThe Dao’s **ultimate application** lies here.\n\nThus:\nThe **high** are **checked** to **reduce their excess**,\nThe **low** are **raised** to **supplement their deficiency**,\nThose with **excess** are **taken from**,\nSo **great** yet **not excessive**,\nThose with **deficiency** are **given to**,\nSo **small** yet **not meager**.\n\nThe Dao’s **application**,\n**Nothing** escapes without attaining **its middle**—\nThus it is said: *“When the Dao is supreme in purity yet applied.”*\n\n**Supreme qi** is **not overfull**,\n**Application** is **not empty**—\nNot **overfull**,\nThus **pouring** from it **never full**;\nNot **empty**,\nThus **measuring** from it **never exhausted**.\n\nOnly the Dao **cannot be encompassed** by **fullness** or **emptiness**,\nThus it **lends and fulfills**,\nYet its **application** is **unending**—\nThe more one **takes** for others, the more one **owns**,\nThe more one **gives** to others, the more one **possesses**.\n\nLike the **Great Void** enveloping the **six extremes**,\nWith **no boundaries**,\n**Immeasurable**,\nCould it **be confined** by **vessels**?\nHow could it **be overfull**?\n\n**Deep**—\nIt **seems like** the **source of all things**.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation** says:\n“Zhuangzi said:\n*The **turtle’s** stillness is **depth**,\n**Still water’s** stillness is **depth**,\n**Flowing water’s** stillness is **depth**.\n**Depth** is **empty** and **still**,\n**Not mingling** with things—\nThis is the Dao’s **essence**.\nOnly because it is **empty**,\nDoes it **gather** all **substantial** things.\nOnly because it is **still**,\nDoes it **embrace** all **movements**—\nThis is the **root** of all things,\nThe **foundation** of **transformation**.\nThus it is said: *‘It seems like the source of all things.’*\nYet the Dao **originally has no roots**,\nThings **naturally follow** the Dao—\nThus it is only **seeming** like this.”\n\nThe **Explanatory Commentary** states:\n“Zhuangzi said:\n*The Dao is deep in its dwelling.*\n**Depth** reflects **flowing water’s** **returning** **wholeness**,\n**Stillness** is **profound** and **level**,\n**Inner clarity** yet **outer obscurity**,\nThough **turtle’s** **stillness** and **flowing water’s** **stillness** differ,\nIt remains **deep** as itself—\n**Probing** it reveals **greater depth**,\n**Exhausting** it reveals **greater distance**,\nThis can be called **emptiness**.\n**Waves** are **not evil**,\n**Stillness** is **not beautiful**—\nThis can be called **stillness**.\nThe Dao’s **essence** resembles this—\nOnly **emptiness**,\nThus it **suffices** to **encompass** the **world’s** **substantial** things;\nOnly **stillness**,\nThus it **suffices** to **embrace** the **world’s** **movements**.\n**Not becoming** things yet **able to make** things **become**,\nThe **root** of all things;\n**Not transforming** yet **able to make** transformations **fulfill**,\nThe **foundation** of **transformation**—\nThus it **seems like** the **source of all things**.”\n\n*The Wenzzi* states:\n*“The **Empty and Unrestrained**,\nThe **source of all things**.”*\nIts **meaning aligns** with this.\n\nThough the Dao **responds** to things **occasionally**,\nIt **originally has no roots**—\n**Moving** through all things,\nThings **naturally follow** it—\nSaying *“the source of all things”*\nIs only **seeming** like this, yet **not truly**.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation** says:\n*“Sharpness** **harms**,\n**Agitation** **mixes**—\n**Blunting** its **sharpness**, it **does not contend**,\n**Relieving** its **agitation**, it **does not disorder**.\n**Harmonizing** its **light**—\nZhuangzi’s

filth**,\n**Shining** as if **displayed**,\n**Moving** like **sun and moon**—\nIs this not *“aligning with its dust”*?\n\nThe **Sage** **blunts** its **sharpness**,\nThus **dwelling** among things **does not harm** things—\nThings **cannot harm** it.\n\n**Relieving** its **agitation**,\nThen **what need** for **scheming**?\n**What need** for **intelligence**?\n**What need** for

with things—\nTo **communicate** the **world’s** **intentions**,\n**Nothing** enters without **finding its own fulfillment**.”\n\nThe **Explanatory Commentary** states:\n“**Sharpness** like **fire’s** **sharpness**,\nCannot **long endure**—\nThus it **harms**.”\n\n*«Agitation* like the **flux of silk**—\nA multitude of threads, **not unified**—\nThus it **entangles**.\n\n**Blunting** its **sharpness** means no **distinct angles** stand erect,\n**Whole** and **undifferentiated** in its **essence**—\nWho could **compete** with it in **movement**?\n\nThis is what **Zhuangzi** spoke of as *“rooting in depth”*.\n\n**Relieving** its **agitation** means the **Spiritual Pivot** (*lingtai* 靈台) **remains steadfast**,\n**External obstructions** vanish, **perturbations** dissolve—\nWho could **disorder** it?\n\nThis is what **Zhuangzi** spoke of as *“binding with restraint”*.\n\n**Fire** **unifies** to form **light**,\nYet **harmony** alone **distinguishes** it—\nThen it **preserves** itself without **display**,\n**Conceals** itself without **action**,\nNever **flaunting** its **course** to **please the multitude**.\n\nIn **Zhuangzi’s** *“Cutting Adornments”* chapter, it is said:\n**“Luminous yet not dazzling.”**\nTo **speak** of **employing** its **light** without **boasting** of **illumination**,\nOnly then does it **align with Heaven’s virtue**.\n\nThis is called *“harmonizing its light”*.\n\n**Coarse** yet **not wondrous**,\nThe **source of dust**—\nIf **uniform** yet **not divergent**,\nThen it **shifts** with the **times**,\n**Adapts** with the **world**,\nNever **clinging to extremes** to **separate itself**.\n\nIn **Zhuangzi’s** *“Geng Sang Pu”* chapter, it is said:\n**“With things it drifts and turns, yet follows their currents.”**\nTo **speak** of the **Classics of Vitality** (*Weisheng Jing* 衛生經),\nIt lies in **yielding** to things in **flexible harmony**,\nNot in **rejecting** the world and **defying customs**.\n\nThis is called *“aligning with its dust”*.\n\nBut if **inner sincerity** is **not dissolved**,\nUnable to **forget the heart**,\n**Form** and **scheming** coalesce into **light**,\nYet **obscurity** is **not employed**,\nThe **abandoner** **avoids** it—\nYet it **cannot** **bury itself** among the people—\nIs this not *“harmonizing its light”*?\n\n**Adorning intelligence** to **startle the ignorant**,\nYet **not relinquishing** **intelligence**—\n**Refining the self** to **reveal filth**,\nYet **not** like the **ignorant**—\n**Luminous** as if **displayed**,\n**Moving** like **sun and moon**—\nYet it **cannot** **be** like the **obscured**—\nIs this not *“aligning with its dust”*?\n\nNow, **the metal** (*fui* 兌) is **sharp**,\nIts **utility** lies in **timely application**—\nIf **transferred** with **sharpness**,\nThen there will be **times** of **ruin** and **breakage**—\nHow could it **avoid injury**?\n\nOnly by **blunting** it—\nThen **sharpness** becomes **dullness**—\nWho could **injure** it?\nThus, **blunting its sharpness**,\nThe **Sage** **dwells** among things **without harming** things,\nThings **cannot harm** it.\n\n**Agitation** is **woven** from **silk**—\nThus it **separates** **filth** and **impurity**,\n**Unification** forms **substance**,\n**Division** multiplies **threads**—\nHow could one **not be disturbed**?\n\nOnly by **relieving** it—\nThen though **agitated**, it is **sealed**,\nNo **inner or outer** **thousandfold**—\n**Thoughts** do not **sprout**,\n**Machinations** do not **rise**,\n**Covering** the **ten thousand directions**,\n**Laying** them out before it—\nYet they **cannot** enter its **unification**.\n\nThus, **relieving** its **agitation**,\nThen **what need** for **scheming**?\n**What need** for **intelligence**?\n**What need** for **adhesion**?\nAll things **lack** what could **disturb** its **heart**—\nIf so, then **no arrogant** **appearance**,\n**No haughty** **qi**,\n**Harmonized**

inevitably.\n\nHeaven and Earth toward the ten thousand things,\nthe sage toward the people—\nthey assist their natural unfolding,\nwith no heart of love or profit.\nVirtue cannot be named thus.\n\nStraw bundled as a dog,\nused in sacrifices—\nwhen appropriate, it is employed;\nwhen spent, it is discarded.\nHow could there be room for the heart\nin the self-generation of the ten thousand things,\nor in the self-governance of the people?\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nTo love people and benefit things is called *bian* (perverse).\nIf the heart is set on loving people,\nits love is not comprehensive;\nif the heart is set on benefiting things,\nits benefit is not thorough.\nFor even when virtue is taken as benevolence,\nthe heart cannot be entirely absent.\n\nMoreover, the origin of benevolence\nalways stems from harm,\nand the origin of harm\nalways arises from benevolence.\nWhere there is harm, benevolence follows;\nwhere there is benevolence, harm ensues—\nthis is the natural order.\n\nHeaven and Earth have no heart toward the ten thousand things,\nthe sage has no heart toward the people.\nThey follow nature without artificial augmentation,\nthus loving all without partiality,\nbenefiting all without exclusion.\nThose who receive the gift do not repay,\nthose who are nourished do not thank—\nbenefits extend to all ages.\nIf not for loving people,\nhow could virtue be named?\n\nZhuangzi’s *great virtue* is *not virtue*—\njust like the sacrificial dog:\nBefore its use, it is adorned in a wicker basket,\nwrapped in embroidered cloth,\nand the ritual officiant, in solemn purity, presents it.\nOnce used, travelers strike its head and spine,\nand the poor take it to cook—\nand that is all.\n\nHow could there be room for the heart\nin the self-generation of the ten thousand things,\nor in the self-governance of the people?\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nis it not like the *tuqiao*?\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:**\nThe *tuqiao* is empty yet receptive,\nreceptive yet responsive—\nthus its response is boundless.\nIf filled with substance,\nit becomes obstructed at every touch.\nIn the Dao, this is one-sidedness;\nin things, this is distortion.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nThe *tu* can contain,\nthe *qiao* can resonate—\nboth are empty yet receptive,\nreceptive yet responsive.\nHow could there be exhaustion in responding to sensation?\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\none *qi* subtly circulates,\npervading without exclusion,\nuntil the limit of demand is reached—\njust like the *tuqiao*.\nIf one thing fills it,\nthere is no place without obstruction.\nHow could Heaven and Earth,\nvast as they are,\nbe confined to one-sidedness,\nor stagnant in distortion?\n\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever emerging.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:**\nEmpty oneself to roam the world,\nand one responds broadly yet precisely—\nthus, *empty yet unyielding*.\nPressured into action,\none’s capacity is boundless—\nthus, *moving

it,\nemptying his essence,\nyet fully manifesting in his actions.\nReturning action to essence,\nhe remains motionless yet encompasses all things,\ntilting none to his advantage,\nthus responding universally—\nwhat could be more appropriate?\n\nArising from essence, his actions are boundless—\nhaving already given all to others,\nhow could there be exhaustion?\nEmptying himself to roam the world,\nhe acts only when pressed—\nthus, his entire life speaks without error,\nand his deeds are without artifice.\n\nIn responding to the Sovereign,\nthere is ample reserve.\nThis is what Zhuangzi

*qi*—\nwhen *qi* arrives, it sounds;\nwhen *qi* does not come, it is silent.\nThe sage’s speech is like this.\nThe sophists’ constraints—\nthough their speech is much,\nthey cannot escape entanglement—\nbetter to hold the center than this.\n\nCultivate your interior,\nclose your exterior,\nretract your gaze, reverse your hearing—\nthus returning to see the heart of Heaven and Earth.\nThis is called *holding the center*.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nAll music arises from emptiness.\nThe *qiao*, as an instrument,\nis the origin of pitch, measure, and weight.\nMusic’s foundation lies here.\nThus the *Odes* speak of “not overstepping the *qiao*,”\nmeaning *empty to await qi*—\nwhen *qi* arrives, it sounds;\nwhen *qi* does not come, it is silent.\n\nThe sage’s speech, when obtained,\nresolves resonance to accord with pitch—\nresponding only when questioned,\nnever deviating from this.\nThus Confucius desired silence,\nand Mencius considered eloquence a reluctant necessity—\nthis is why.\n\nThose who cannot forget speech,\nrambling on to tens of thousands of words,\nfilling libraries with five chariots of texts—\nthese are the sophists’ constraints.\nThough much, what use is it?\n\nThe holder of the center is otherwise:\nreaching the truth of things while guarding their root,\ncommanding their transformation while guarding their origin,\ncautious of the exterior without its manifold disputes,\nclosed to the interior without its thousandfold errors.\n\nThe eyes see nothing—\nretracting vision,\nvision turns to the obscure;\nthe ears hear nothing—\nreversing hearing,\nhearing turns to the soundless.\nReturning to self-awareness,\nthe heart of Heaven and Earth becomes plainly visible.\nGuard this without loss—\nthough one speaks not a word all life,\none has never failed to speak.\nWhy clamor then?\n\nFor the center unites above and below—\nthis is called the *great root of the world*.\nSpeech cannot exhaust this—\neven if one speaks much to exchange it,\nbetter to hold the center.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit** (*Gǔshén Zhāng*)\nThe Valley Spirit does not die,\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nWhat has form must have waxing and waning,\nwhat has measure must have completion and decay—\nwhen form and measure are both complete,\nlife and death are distinguished,\nthis is the nature of things.\n\nThe Valley Spirit receives all movement yet remains ever empty,\nthe Mysterious Dao manifests all things yet remains ever still.\nWithin the eternal truth,\nit is one with the Way,\nnot clinging to form,\nnot entrapped by measure.\nEndlessly generating life,\nlike the sun and moon,\nit ceases not through all ages,\nlike the Southern Dipper,\nit never errs through all ages—\nthus it is said, *\"The Valley Spirit does not die.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains:\nWhen waxing reaches its peak, it turns to waning;\nwhen waning reaches its extreme, it turns to waxing—\nthis is true of all that has form.\nWhen completion comes, decay follows swiftly;\nwhen decay comes, completion follows swiftly—\nthis is true of all that has measure.\nOnce it has become a thing,\nno form or measure can escape it—\nthis is why all that is born must also perish.\nWhen one yin descends below,\none yang ascends above—\nnone who remain within yin and yang\ncan escape this fate.\n\nYet the Valley Spirit is different.\nIt receives without accumulating,\nresponds to all movement yet remains ever empty—\nits yin and yang are unfathomable.\nIt manifests all things yet remains ever still—\nwithin the eternal truth,\nit is one with the Way.\nIt cannot be sought through form,\nnor traced through measure—\nfor form is finite yet this is boundless,\nmeasure is ending yet this is endless.\nIt transforms beyond all existence,\nendlessly generating life—\nthis is what is meant by *\"never having died.\"*\n\nLike the sun and moon,\nit moves onward and returns without ceasing;\nlike the Southern Dipper,\nit revolves southward and northward without error—\nhow then could one know its end?\nThis is called the *Dark Mother*.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nAll things receive their mandate from the *Non-Existent*,\nyet take form in the *Existent*—\nthe Valley’s function is without likeness,\nthe Spirit’s essence is without boundary—\nthis is the mandate from which all things arise.\nThe *Dark* is the color of Heaven,\nthe *Mother* is the type of Earth—\nthis is the form in which all things are completed.\n\nThe Valley Spirit and the Dark Mother\nillustrate the eternal Way’s constancy,\nand the marvelous workings of creation.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains:\nContinuous without interruption is called *mandate*—\nfrom what does this mandate arise?\nIt is the Valley Spirit.\nWhen things are born and their principles are established, this is called *mandate*—\nwhat bestows this form?\nIt is the Dark Mother.\nEmpty yet skillful in response,\nwhen viewed, no form is seen—\nthis is the Valley’s function without likeness.\nRound yet ever in motion,\nwhen sought, no trace of its origin is known—\nthis is the Spirit’s essence without boundary.\nHere lies the source of all things’ mandate.\n\nRed and black are the *Dark*—\nthus the *Yijing* speaks of \"Heaven’s Dark and Earth’s Yellow,\"\nand the *Dark* is the color of Heaven.\nYang is the *Male*, yin is the *Female*—\nthus the *Yijing* speaks of \"Kūn’s advantage in the *Female* horse’s correctness,\"\nand the *Female* is the type of Earth.\nHere lies the basis of all things’ form.\n\nThe Valley Spirit and the Dark Mother—\ndifferent names, yet the same reality.\nSpeaking of its eternal existence,\nit is called the Valley Spirit,\nto illustrate the eternal Way’s constancy.\nSpeaking of its generating life,\nit is called the Dark Mother,\nto reveal creation’s marvelous workings.\nNames are contrary,\nyet their essence flows in harmony.\n\nThe gate of the Dark Mother—\nthis is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth*.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nZhuangzi said:\nAll things have a source of life yet no one sees its root,\nthey have a place of emergence yet no one sees its gate—\nonly the Sage can see it.\nThus here it is made clear:\nThe gate of the Dark Mother\nis called the *Root of Heaven and Earth*.\nHeaven and Earth are the above and below of all things.\nThings and Heaven and Earth—\nin origin, there is no before or after.\nYet when the great Way’s order is made clear,\nthere is Heaven and Earth,\nand then there are all things.\nBut the source from which Heaven and Earth emerge—\nit is the Dark Mother.\nWho could see the One that gave birth before Heaven and Earth?\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains:\nThe birth of things—\nits emergence has no origin,\nthus no one sees its root.\nIts coming has no progression,\nthus no one sees its gate.\nOnly the Sage sees what others do not see,\nand perceives the unseen form—\nthe self-originating, self-rooted,\nyet the gate through which all marvels pass.\nKnowing it as one sees,\nit is directly pointed to its fundamental essence,\nand declared: *\"The gate of the Dark Mother—\nthis is called the Root of Heaven and Earth.\"*\nThis is what Zhuangzi meant when he said:\nAll things have a source of life yet no one sees its root,\nthey have a place of emergence yet no one sees its gate.\n\nMoreover, Heaven opens above,\nEarth opens below,\nand humans dwell within—\nthus Heaven and Earth are the above and below of all things.\nHeaven and Earth are born with me,\nall things are one with me—\nhow then could one observe things and Heaven and Earth as prior or subsequent?\nThere is Heaven and Earth,\nand then there are all things—\nthis is merely the sequence of the Way.\n\nThe source from which Heaven and Earth emerge—\nit is called the Dark Mother—\nthen who could see the One that gave birth before Heaven and Earth?\n\nEndless, as if eternally present,\nits use requires no effort.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nSelf-originating, self-rooted,\nit has existed since ancient times—\nthe transmission of fire knows no end.\nThis is what is meant by *\"endless, as if eternally present.\"*\n\nWhen things are born, it is Heaven’s work,\nleaving the single *qi* to move on its own—\nwhen Earth transforms, it is swift,\nentrusting all forms to their own proliferation—\nthe *Yijing*’s *Qian* is easily understood,\nthe *Yijing*’s *Kūn* is simple in ability—\nnot by force, but how could there be effort?\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains:\n*Endless*—this means unceasing.\n*As if eternally present*—this means not perishing.\nThe Classic speaks of *\"deep and vast, as if there might be a few traces remaining\"*—\nthis is it.\nThe utmost of the Way,\nbefore Heaven and Earth yet without beginning,\nafter Heaven and Earth yet without end—\nit seems to perish yet remains,\nand can be said to have existed since ancient times.\nLike the transmission of fire,\nit relies on fuel to illuminate,\nand when the green is consumed, it returns to the fuel—\nthough it ends, it never truly ends.\nThis is what is meant by *\"endless, as if eternally present.\"*\n\nYet Heaven is merely the accumulation of *qi*—\nthe beginning from which all things draw their resources.\nBut Heaven’s creation of things\nleaves the single *qi* to move on its own—\nit does not exert force to create them.\nEarth is merely the accumulation of form—\nthe basis from which all things draw their growth.\nYet Earth’s transformation of things\nentrusts all forms to their own proliferation—\nit does not use power to change them.\n\n**Great is the Primordial of Heaven (乾元),**\nby its ease we come to know it;\n**Profound is the Primordial of Earth (坤元),**\nby its simplicity it achieves all.\nIts wondrous functions are complete—\nno contrivance is needed,\nnaturally so—\nwhat labor is there?\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven’s Longevity and Earth’s Endurance (天长地久)**\nHeaven and Earth endure long because\nthey do not generate themselves—\nthus they endure forever.\n\n**Commentary by Emperor Huizong (徽宗注):**\nThe vault of Heaven arches above,\nwith the Sun and Moon as its longitudinal threads,\nand stars as its latitudinal weaves—\nand all things are sheltered beneath it.\nThe Earth is solid and square below,\nforming mountains and valleys,\nmerging into rivers and lakes—\nand all things rest upon it.\n\nAll things are sheltered and borne by Heaven and Earth,\nyet Heaven and Earth hold no intention toward them—\nthus Heaven moves with steadfast certainty,\nand Earth remains with unyielding stability—\nthis is how they endure long.\n\nIf Heaven and Earth were to harbor intent toward life,\nthen Heaven would soon be measured,\nits sheltering shallow,\nand Earth would soon be fathomed,\nits bearing thin.\nThus would they depend on others—\nhow could they then endure?\n\n**Explanatory Notes (疏义):**\nLight and pure is Heaven, round and in motion,\nso its form arches above.\nHeavy and turbid is Earth, square and at rest,\nso its form is solid below.\nHeaven’s *qi* ascends—\nthe Sun and Moon, the stars—\nall are accumulations of *qi* in Heaven,\nand all beneath the sky are what it shelters.\nEarth’s forms settle—\nmountains and rivers—\nall are accumulations of form in Earth,\nand all upon the land are what it bears.\n\nHeaven shelters without partiality,\nEarth bears without favor—\nHeaven and Earth hold no intent toward all things.\nThus, with effortless ease, their motion never ceases,\nand with simple steadfastness, their stance never falters—\nthis is how Heaven and Earth endure long.\n\nIf one were to rely on contrivance,\ndepend on cleverness,\nand carve or chisel mere grains of matter—\nthis would be to harbor intent toward life.\nHow could such labor compare to the divine efficacy of Heaven and Earth?\nSurely it would be shallow and insufficient in its sheltering and bearing.\nThus would it depend on others—\nwhat choice would it have with things?\n\nOnly by not generating itself,\nand abiding in the realm of non-generation,\ncan it endure forever.\n\nTherefore, the Sage places his own self last,\nyet his self comes first;\nsets his self aside,\nyet his self is preserved.\n\n**Commentary by Emperor Huizong (徽宗注):**\nHeaven moves above, Earth rests below,\nand the Sage dwells between them.\nAs *San Cai* (三才)—Heaven, Earth, and Sage—\ntheir functions are mutually resonant.\nAs *San Ji* (三极)—three poles—\ntheir forms stand distinct.\nAs *San Ling* (三灵)—three spirits—\ntheir divine mystery knows no separation.\n\nThus, Heaven, Earth, and the Sage all attain the Dao,\nand the Sage’s cultivation of his self\nis already that of Heaven and Earth.\nHence, this chapter first speaks of Heaven and Earth’s non-generation,\nthen follows with the Sage’s non-possession of his self.\n\nAll take precedence—\nonly the Sage takes last,\nsaying, *\"I receive the filth of the world\"*—\nthis is called placing his self last.\nBy placing his self last,\nhe does not contend with things,\nand thus none can contend with him—\nhence, *\"placing his self last, his self comes first.\"*\n\nOn the path, he does not vie for advantage in peril or ease;\nin winter and summer, he does not cling to the harmony of yin and yang;\nhe transcends life and death,\nsets aside fortune and calamity—\nyet his spirit is never constrained—\nthis is called setting his self aside, yet his self is preserved.\n\nThus is the Sage’s cultivation of his self—\nhow much more so for matters beyond the self?\nHe encounters without resisting,\npasses without clinging,\nembracing nature’s essence and nurturing the spirit,\nto wander between the world’s affairs.\nHis form will naturally align,\nself and things become one—\nborn before Heaven and Earth yet not enduring,\nlonger than ancient times yet not aging—\nthis is its effect.\n\n**Explanatory Notes (疏义):**\nHeaven’s duty is to generate and shelter—\nthus it moves above.\nEarth’s duty is to form and bear—\nthus it rests below.\nThe Sage’s duty is to teach and transform—\nthus he dwells between Heaven and Earth.\n\nTheir functions are mutually resonant—\nhence called *San Cai*.\nTheir forms stand distinct—\nhence called *San Ji*.\nTheir spirits are inseparable—\nhence called *San Ling*.\nThus, observing Heaven, Earth, and the Sage,\nthough their paths differ, their Dao is one.\n\nThe Sage’s cultivation of his self\nneed not be sought elsewhere—\nit is evident in Heaven and Earth.\nHence, this chapter first speaks of Heaven and Earth,\nthen follows with the Sage.\n\nFor not generating itself is to forget generation,\nnot possessing the self is to forget the self—\nforgetting generation, yet enduring;\nforgetting the self, yet the self is preserved—\nthis is how Heaven and Earth are Heaven and Earth,\nhow the Sage is the Sage.\n\nSince others take precedence,\nthe Sage alone takes last—\nas the Classic says, *\"To be first among men,\none must place his self last.\"*\nRivers and lakes accept filth,\nrulers bear the nation’s shame—\nthus, *\"receiving the world’s filth\"*—\nthe Classic says, *\"receiving the nation’s filth,\nthis is the duty of the sovereign.\"*\nAll these are acts of placing his self last—\nonly by placing his self last\ndoes he embody yielding, weakness, and humility,\nand not contend with things.\nOnly by not contending\ndoes he empty himself to wander in the world—\nwho could harm him?\nThus, none can contend with him—\nthis is the way of *\"placing his self last, yet his self comes first.\"*\n\nTo walk with haste—\nnot avoiding peril or ease in rivers and valleys—\nthis is what others contend for,\nyet he does not vie for advantage in peril or ease on the path.\nTo seek warmth and shun cold—\nthis is natural harmony of yin and yang,\nyet he does not cling to it in winter and summer.\nTo delight in life and fear death,\nto seek fortune and avoid calamity—\nthis is human nature,\nyet he transcends life and death,\nsets aside fortune and calamity.\n\nThis has no other secret—\nknowing that the body is not mine to possess,\nwhile the four limbs and myriad bones will soon become dust and filth,\nthus he can be in perfect harmony with all things,\nand not cling to his own body.\n\nIf so, then he houses the myriad bones as mere forms of ears and eyes,\nwhile his spirit is never burdened or constrained—\nwhat thing could harm him?\nThis is what is meant by *\"transcending his body yet his body remains.\"*\n\nNo one values his own body more than its own worth—\nthe Sage governs it thus,\nhow much more so for external matters?\nWhen they come, he does not resist them,\nknowing that their arrival cannot be prevented;\nwhen they pass, he does not cling to them,\nknowing that their departure cannot be stopped.\nHe does not burden himself with form,\nwhile his true nature embraces the spirit,\nand he wanders among people as their equal,\nthrough the world of the mundane.\n\nForm will naturally align itself,\nand things and self become one—\nto live long and see far,\nand to endure alongside Heaven and Earth,\nthen to be born before Heaven and Earth,\nand not to be aged by longevity,\nwhat could be more difficult?\nIs it not because he has no selfishness?\nThus he can fulfill his own true nature.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"The greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is called ‘life’ (生),\nand the greatest treasure of the Sage is called ‘position’ (位).\nThe Dao/Way makes them public—\nHeaven and Earth embody the Dao/Way,\nthus they have no selfishness,\nand no selfishness brings enduring longevity.\nThe Sage embodies the Dao/Way,\nthus he has no selfishness,\nand no selfishness ensures his eternal existence.\nTo cultivate oneself for selfish gain—\nnone have succeeded in fulfilling their selfishness.\nThe *Commentary* states:\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of all forms,\ntheir difference from myriad things lies in their enduring longevity.\nThe Sage’s distinction from the common folk lies in his eternal existence.\nThe *Book of Changes* (《易》) says:\n‘The greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is called life,\nand the greatest treasure of the Sage is called position.\nHeaven and Earth thus give birth and endure,\nthe Sage thus preserves his position and remains eternal,\nall because of their lack of selfishness.’\n\nTo obstruct the Dao/Way with selfishness—\none cannot attain the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way makes all things public,\nand one can only be without selfishness\nby embodying the Dao/Way.\nHan Feizi says:\n‘To cultivate oneself for selfish gain is selfishness,\nto abandon selfishness for the public is virtue.\nSince the body does not generate itself,\nand one transcends his own body,\nhow could he cultivate for selfishness?\nThe means by which he attains enduring longevity and bodily preservation—\nthis is what is meant by *fulfilling his own true nature*.\n\nChapter Eight: The Supreme Good is Like Water\nFrom the section *\"The Supreme Good is Like Water\"* (上善若水)\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*The Classic of Changes* says: “The interplay of one yin and one yang is called the Dao/Way; what follows it is virtue.”\nZhuangzi says: “To depart from the Dao/Way for the sake of virtue—once the name of virtue is established, the very body of the Dao/Way is impaired.”\n\nYet, Heaven’s One generates Water, and though it departs slightly from the Dao/Way, its depths are vast and empty, its stillness clear—this is called the utmost refinement under Heaven. Hence, *the Supreme Good is like Water*.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nYin and yang are the great movements of *qi*.\nFrom the perspective of *qi* before it manifests, it is neither yin nor yang—this is the Dao/Way.\nAll things bear yin within and embrace yang; from their operation in the myriad things, it is said that they do not depart from yin and yang—this too is the Dao/Way.\n*The Classic of Changes* says: “The interplay of one yin and one yang is called the Dao/Way”—this is merely speaking of things.\nDescending from the Dao/Way, what humans desire most is virtue, and so it is said that what follows the Dao/Way is virtue.\nSince the Dao/Way is singular, once it is called virtue, it is divided from the Dao/Way.\nTheir division is their succession, hence Zhuangzi says: “To depart from the Dao/Way for the sake of virtue.”\nFor once the name of virtue is established, the undivided whole is split, and the body of the Dao/Way is impaired.\n\nYet, the Nine Categories begin with the Five Phases, and the Five Phases prioritize Water—thus, Heaven’s One generates Water, though it departs slightly from the Dao/Way.\nThough it overflows, it does not lose its measure—it is deep and empty.\nWhen clarified, it reveals even the finest hairs; when still, it is luminous.\nWhat under Heaven is more refined than this? And so, *the Supreme Good is like Water*—unlike those who merely know virtue as virtue.\n\nWater is good at benefiting all things without contention,\ndwelling where all detest it—\nthus it approaches the Dao/Way.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nWhen it melts, it becomes rain and dew, nourishing all;\nwhen it congeals, it becomes frost and snow, shaping all.\nWhen dispersed, it becomes rivers and streams; when gathered, it forms lakes and marshes.\nDeep as springs, vast as seas—it is drawn for use, stored for reserve, and abundant.\nIt generates and nourishes all things, yet never exhausts them.\nWho benefits all things better than this?\n\nIts beneficence to all things—\nin Heaven, as rain and dew, all things receive its blessings;\non Earth, as springs and depths, all things accept its gifts.\nYet its nature is yielding and weak,\nalways dwelling in non-contention, receiving filth and defilement,\nnot seeking its own good, unburdened by self-regard—\nthus it approaches the Dao/Way.\n*Ji* means “near.”\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nHeaven’s One generates Water, flowing without end.\nIn Heaven, when yang-*qi* prevails, it melts into rain and dew,\nspreading to nourish all things, thus all are nourished.\nWhen yin-*qi* prevails, it congeals into frost and snow,\nengraving to complete all things, thus all treasures are formed.\nOn Earth, it disperses as rivers and streams,\ngathers as lakes and marshes;\nits encompassing return to wholeness is the depth of springs—\nwhen measured, its end is unseen—\nthe vastness of seas—\ndrawn for use, stored for reserve, and abundant.\nIts generation and nourishment are inexhaustible;\nall things rely on it without depletion,\ntaking as they need, given as they require—\nwho benefits all things better than this?\n\nIts beneficence to all things—\nin Heaven, as rain and dew, all things receive its blessings;\non Earth, as springs and depths, all things accept its gifts.\nYet its nature is yielding and weak,\nalways dwelling in non-contention, receiving filth and defilement,\nnot seeking its own good, unburdened by self-regard—\nthus it approaches the Dao/Way.\n*Ji* is the subtle beginning of movement—\n*ji* means “near,” for it is the movement before reaching its destination.\nTo approach the Dao/Way is to be near the Dao/Way.\n\n**Residing in the good of place,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nIt flows through the earth, yet never overflows.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nWater is called “moistening the low”—\nthus it moves through the earth.\nIt fills the depressions before advancing—\nthus it flows without overflowing.\n\n**The mind is good at depth,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nThe deeper it is measured, the deeper it becomes;\nthe farther it is explored, the vaster it grows.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nA thousand *ren* of height is insufficient to fathom its depth—\nthe deeper it is measured, the deeper it becomes;\na thousand *li* of breadth is insufficient to contain its vastness—\nthe farther it is explored, the vaster it grows.\n\n**To act with goodness is to be benevolent,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nIt loves all without selfishness, giving without discrimination.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nWherever frost and dew fall, there is no far or near—\nall under Heaven is encompassed by its blessings,\ntruly loving all without selfishness, giving without discrimination.\n\n**To speak with goodness is to be trustworthy,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nIt avoids obstacles to reach the seas,\ntraverses dangers without losing its course.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nIt studies the sea and arrives at the sea—\nthis is to avoid obstacles to reach the seas.\nThough it twists a myriad times, it must return to the east—\nthis is to traverse dangers without losing its course.\n\n**To govern with goodness is to bring order,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nIt cleanses the impure, smooths the perilous,\nfollowing the natural course of things, without contrivance—\nthus nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nBy its ebb and flow, it attains purity—\nthus it cleanses the impure.\nIts measure is even and balanced—\nthus it smooths the perilous.\nIf it follows its natural course,\nthere is no contrivance of the heart.\nThus, though it appears undirected,\nnothing remains ungoverned.\n\n**To act with goodness is to be capable,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nIt adapts to the terrain to form curves and straight paths,\nconforms to vessels to become round and square,\nits changes are ever-varying yet ever-constant—\nwho is as capable as this?\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nIts flow follows natural paths—\nthus it adapts to the terrain to form curves and straight paths.\nIt responds as taken—\nthus it conforms to vessels to become round and square.\nIt can be struck to rise above the forehead,\nor stirred to fill the mountains—\nyet its balance is ever-true,\nand the master craftsman takes it as his model.\nIts changes are ever-varying,\nyet ever-constant in balance—\nwho is as capable as this?\n\n**To move with goodness is to act in season.***\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nWhen yang releases it, it becomes mist;\nwhen yin congeals it, it becomes ice.\nIn the east, it gathers as streams;\nin the west, it flows westward—\nits movement is unrestrained,\nproper only to the seasons.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nWhen the season is spring, yang-qi rises from below,\nand ice melts into water—\nyang releases it, making it flow.\nWhen the season is winter, yin-qi reaches its peak,\nand water congeals into ice—\nyin congeals it, making it solid.\nIt does not stagnate in one corner,\nnor cling to one curve.\nIn the east, it flows eastward;\nin the west, it flows westward—\nmoving with things, unrestrained,\nproper only to the seasons.\n\nOnly the non-contending thus has no blame.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nThe Sage embodies the Dao to govern himself,\nand thus endures eternally.\nHe embraces all goodness to benefit beings,\ndwelling in the non-contending.\n\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"Is it easy to have and yet do nothing with it?\"*\nTo act rashly is contrary to Heaven’s will.\nTo act without effort and yet commit few faults—this is easy;\nto act with effort and yet never rest—this is difficult.\nIf one seeks to benefit beings through action,\nthen avoiding blame becomes difficult.\n\nThe highest goodness benefits beings,\nlike water’s nature—\nthough it benefits all without discrimination,\nit does not contend with things,\nand thus nothing can contend with it—\nhence, no blame.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Under Heaven, none are as soft and weak as water,\nyet none can surpass it in overcoming the firm and strong.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nThe Sage responds to the world—\nin his self-cultivation, he embodies the Dao within,\nthus governing himself with enduring permanence,\nequal to Heaven and Earth.\nIn his actions toward others, he embraces all goodness,\nthus benefiting beings.\nDwelling in the non-contending,\nhis movement is like water’s.\n\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"Is it easy to have and yet do nothing with it?\"*\nTo act rashly is contrary to Heaven’s will.\nThe gentleman, before taking action,\nfirst purifies himself to refine his virtue—\nthus, action cannot be rash.\nTo act without effort and yet commit few faults—this is easy;\nto act with effort and yet never rest—this is difficult.\nIf one makes benefiting beings his purpose,\nthen he cannot avoid action,\nand thus avoiding blame becomes difficult.\n\nMoreover, it is improper to favor the upper over the lower,\nor the left over the right—\nall these lead to blame.\nOnly the highest goodness benefits beings,\nlike water’s nature—\nextending and contracting without left or right,\nbenefiting all without discrimination,\nnot contending while nothing can contend with it—\nin all transformations, ever one,\nnothing can overcome it—\nhence, no blame.\n\nThis aligns with the *Classic*’s saying:\n*\"Under Heaven, none are as soft and weak as water,\nyet none can surpass it in overcoming the firm and strong.\"*\n\n**Chapter Nine: \"Holding Fullness\"**\nTo hold fullness to the brim\nis not as good as stopping in time.\nTo sharpen to a point\ncannot be long preserved.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nFullness overflows;\nsharpness dulls—\nthis is the nature of all things.\nFullness must have its loss;\nto not know how to hold back in advance,\nto grasp emptiness while governing fullness,\nand to indulge in the desire for fullness—\nthis only increases the risk of ruin.\nThus, it is better to stop in time.\n\nThings’ transformations are boundless,\nyet human wisdom is limited.\nPreemptive foresight is the flower of the Dao,\nthe beginning of folly.\n\nTo probe things’ nature and yet rush forward—\nwisdom will falter in time.\nHow can it be long preserved?\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nThings have fixed measures—\nthus, fullness overflows,\nand sharpness dulls—\nfullness must have its loss;\nthis is the nature of all things.\nIf one does not wield the adaptable power of compliance,\nhold back in advance,\nor grasp the handle of humility to govern fullness—\nif one indulges in the transformations of growth and decay,\nchanging with the times,\nand yet drowns in the desire for fullness—\nthis only increases the risk of ruin.\nThus, to hold fullness to the brim\nis not as good as stopping in time.\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"Those who embody the Dao can hold fullness without tipping.\"*\n\nIndeed, this is different.\nTo face myriad movements with one body,\nto shoulder ten thousand affairs with one mind—\nto exhaust one’s clarity and wisdom in response—\nthis will inevitably lead to exhaustion.\nThough one’s foresight may be keen,\nit may still fail to address all circumstances,\nfor things’ transformations are boundless while human wisdom is limited.\n\nTo wear out one’s spirit in reckless speculation—\nthis is called preemptive foresight.\nPreemptive foresight leads to clinging to trifles while forgetting the root,\nlaboring the mind until it grows dull—\nthis is called the flower of the Dao,\nthe beginning of folly.\n\nTo use wisdom as a chisel,\nprobing things’ nature and yet rushing forward—\nwisdom will falter in time.\nEven if gained, it will be lost—\nhow can it be long preserved?\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"Those who embody the Dao rest without exhaustion,\nwhile those who rely on schemes labor without success.\"*\nIs this not so?\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nyet none can guard them.\nRiches and honor breed arrogance,\nand thus invite their own ruin.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nGold, jade, riches, and honor\nare not the essence of life and death—\nthey are external things one cannot rely upon.\nTo treasure gold and jade is to be burdened by things.\nIf burdened by things, how can one avoid loss?\nThus, none can guard them.\nRiches and honor breed arrogance,\nand thus harm one’s virtue.\nIf virtue is harmed, how can one avoid ruin?\nThus, one invites blame upon oneself.\n\nThe Sage does not cling to the world’s transient gains as his own,\nnor does he seek dominion over all as his own display.\nHow could gold and jade be treasured,\nor riches and honor be burdensome?\n\nThus, in the most prosperous of states,\nwealth and honors converge—\nits nobility is unmatched,\nits riches unparalleled—\nyet the Dao remains unchanged.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nWithin the realm of self-cultivation, nothing is untrue;\noutside it, nothing is unfalse.\nGold, jade, riches, and honor are external things,\nnot the essence of life and death.\nExternal things cannot be relied upon—\ngain and loss follow in turn.\nThus, they are not things one can possess.\n\nWhat is treasured within oneself\nexists everywhere;\nwhat is treasured in things\nis lost as soon as gained.\nTo treasure gold and jade is to be burdened by things—\nwhen things depart, how can one avoid loss?\n\nThus, none can truly hold onto it.\n\nWealth and honor with humility—this is the virtue of the noble.\nArrogance, licentiousness, and boastfulness—these lead to ruin.\nWealth and honor with arrogance harm one’s virtue;\nharming virtue is what people reject—how could one avoid misfortune?\nThus, one invites one’s own blame.\n\nThe Sage does not cling to the benefits of a single age as his private gain,\nbut rejoices in shared prosperity;\nnor does he seek dominion over all as his own display,\nbut finds joy in the Way and forgets worldly power.\n\nIs it not the case that precious goods like gold and jade are not true treasures,\nthat fame and profit are not the heart’s desire,\nand that wealth and honor are burdensome?\n\nThus, all ten thousand things are complete within oneself—\nin the most prosperous of states, wealth and resources converge—\nyet the riches of Jin and Chu are not what is meant by true wealth.\nTo govern all things, surpassing all others—\nin the most noble of states, rank and honor converge—\nyet the nobility of Zhao and Meng is not what is meant by true nobility.\nIts nobility is unmatched, its riches unparalleled,\neternal through ages past and present—\nthus, the Dao remains unchanged.\n\nWhen achievement is complete, reputation fulfilled,\none withdraws—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nThe *Commentary of Emperor Huizong* says:\nWhen achievement is complete, it decays;\nwhen reputation is fulfilled, it falters.\nAs the sun reaches its zenith, it declines;\nas the moon is full, it wanes—\nthis is the nature of things.\nThe Sage perceives how completion and decay follow one another,\nrecognizes the cycles of fullness and emptiness,\nrises above all things with ease,\nunburdened by external things,\nfree from the perils of arrogance and excess—\nthis is true wisdom.\nWho else can match this understanding?\nThus it is said: *When achievement is complete, reputation fulfilled, one withdraws—this is the Way of Heaven.*\n\nThe cycles of the four seasons—\nwhen achievement is complete, it departs—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.\nIf one knows how to advance but not retreat,\nif one knows how to preserve but not perish,\nif one knows how to gain but not lose—\nhow could one avoid regret?\n\nYi Yin said:\n*\"I do not dwell on favor and profit at the height of success.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nWhen achievement reaches its peak, it is destined to decline;\nwhen reputation is perfected, it is destined to falter.\nGazing upward at the heavens,\nthe sun governs the yang, the moon the yin—\nyet even the sun and moon have their eclipses.\nHow much more so the fleeting fortunes of worldly success and fame?\n\nThe Sage comprehends the principles of all things,\nknows that completion is swiftly followed by decay,\nsees how completion and decay are interdependent,\nunderstands the cycles of fullness and emptiness,\nand their inevitable order.\nNot clinging to what others possess,\nhe finds true fulfillment within himself,\nunburdened by external things,\nunconstrained by them,\nmodest yet receptive, balanced yet complete,\nfree from the breath of arrogance and excess,\nharmonizing with the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness,\nmoving with the times.\nViewing wealth and honor as fleeting shadows passing by,\nor as gnats before one’s face—\nhow could they be burdensome?\n\nWho else, if not the knower of Heaven, could attain this?\nThus it is said: *When achievement is complete, reputation fulfilled, one withdraws—this is the Way of Heaven.*\n\nNow, when *Wu* emerges, *Jing* retreats;\nwhen *Jia* flourishes, *Gui* declines—\nthe cycles of the four seasons—\nwhen achievement is complete, it departs—\nthis is the Way of Heaven.\n\nIf one knows how to advance but not retreat,\nendlessly pursuing progress;\nif one knows how to preserve but not perish,\nclinging to existence without adaptation;\nif one knows how to gain but not lose,\nfearing loss after acquisition—\nhow could one avoid regret?\n\nYi Yin said:\n*\"I do not dwell on favor and profit at the height of success.\"*\n\nIndeed, to dwell is to invite departure—\nwhen achievement is complete, reputation fulfilled, one withdraws—\nthus, by not dwelling, one does not depart.\nThose who uphold this principle should reflect deeply upon it.\n\n**Chapter Ten: On the Nourishment of the *Pò* (魄)**\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*Pò* is the Yin aspect—\nit adheres to the body and finds its resting place,\nhence the Master Lao spoke of the *Pò* as **nourishment** (營).\n*The Hun* (魂) is the Yang aspect—\nit rides upon the *qi* and knows no obstruction,\nhence the *Yì* (易) spoke of the *Hun* as **wandering** (游).\nThe Sage governs form with the *Shén* (神),\nand controls *Pò* with the *Hun* (魂);\nthus, the *Shén* always **nourishes** (載) *Pò* but is never **nourished** by it—\nlike a chariot’s movement, carrying all things within it,\nlike the passage of time, where cold and heat succeed one another.\nWith **heavenly wandering** (天游) in the heart,\nthe six *Chè* (彻) mutually interpenetrate—\ntranscending Heaven and Earth,\nleaving all things behind,\nyet the *Shén* is never constrained—\nhow much less could it be **obstructed** by *Pò*?\n\nThe *Cūnyì* (疏義) states:\n*Pò* is born from **color** (色)—\nits character is composed of *bái* (白).\n*Bái* is the Yin hue.\nIf it enters without transformation,\nknowing no obstruction,\nthen it adheres to the body and finds its resting place—\nhence the Master Lao spoke of the *Pò* as **nourishment**.\n**Nourishment** implies a resting place.\n*The Hun* (魂) is the domain of *qi*—\nits character is composed of *yún* (云).\n*Yún* is the Yang *qi*.\nIf it moves in and out, dispersing and gathering,\nwhile the *Shén* responds to it,\nthen it rides upon the *qi* and knows no obstruction—\nhence the *Yì* spoke of the *Hun* as **wandering**.\n**Wandering** implies no obstruction.\n\nThe Sage governs form with the *Shén*,\nnot allowing the *Shén* to be burdened by the form;\nand controls *Pò* with the *Hun*,\nnot allowing the *Hun* to be confined by *Pò*.\nThus, the *Shén* always **nourishes** *Pò* but is never **nourished** by it—\nlike a chariot’s movement, carrying all things within it,\nunspoiled in its core,\nlike the passage of time, where cold and heat succeed one another,\nand all beings ride upon it.\n\nWith **heavenly wandering** in the heart,\none rises above the mundane and transcends the dust of the world,\nyet fully encompasses the body—\nthis differs from those who restrict themselves to a narrow dwelling.\nThe six *Chè* (彻) mutually interpenetrate—\nfrom the *Chè* of the eyes to the *Chè* of wisdom,\nfilling all without boundary—\nthis differs from the six *Záo* (凿) that repel one another.\nKnowing that Heaven and Earth were born with me yet able to transcend them,\nknowing that all things share existence with me yet able to leave them behind,\nentering and exiting the six *Hé* (合),\nspanning and weaving all directions,\nyet the *Shén* is never constrained—\nhow much less could it be confined by form and **obstructed** by *Pò*?\n\nCan one who **embraces Unity** (抱一) avoid separation?\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n**Heaven’s Unity** (天一) generates water,\nwhich in things is **Essence** (精).\n**Earth’s Two** (地二) generates fire,\nwhich in things is **Spirit** (神).\n**Spirit** and **Essence** arise from the Dao,\nthe form is born from **Essence**,\nand if one guards them without loss,\nthey align with **Spirit**—\nthen **Essence** and **Spirit** merge without separation.\nWith **Essence** gathering **Spirit**,\nwith **Spirit** animating the form,\nand with the form preserving **Spirit**,\n**Essence** is complete without depletion,\n**Spirit** functions without exhaustion,\nand the form lives without decay—\nlike the sun and moon adorning the sky,\nlike grasses and trees adorning the earth,\nthey never part.\n\nI have often expounded this:\nWhen a person is born,\n**Essence** gathers **Spirit**,\nand the bodily form is thus complete.\nThe fourfold flow spreads and converges,\nreaching all extremes—\nabove it meets Heaven,\nbelow it coils with Earth,\ntransforming and nurturing all things,\nbeyond any likeness—\nthis is called **Emperor-like** (同帝).\nYet the foolish of the world\nenslave themselves to things,\nlose their nature in worldly affairs,\nand in no moment of rest\npreserve **Spirit** within.\nThey chase endless desires,\nabandon **Essence** externally,\nand the *Hun* follows *Pò*,\nwhile the form burdens **Spirit**—\nthus they descend with all things into transformation,\nis this not bewilderment?\n\nThe Sage is not so.\n**Nourishing** *Pò* to harmonize,\n**embracing Unity** to guard,\n**preserving** **Spirit** to stillness—\nthen the form will naturally rectify itself.\nIts **Spirit** rests in the **Great Mountain** (太山) yet does not change,\ndwells in the **Deep Springs** (渊泉) yet is not dampened—\nwho knows its origin?\nWho knows its end?\nHence it is said: *The Sage values **Essence**.*\n\nThe *Cūnyì* states:\nThe Dao generates **Unity** (一),\nand **Unity** is water—\nhence **Heaven’s Unity** generates water,\nwhich in things is **Essence**.\n**Unity** generates **Two** (二),\nand **Two** is fire—\nhence **Earth’s Two** generates fire,\nwhich in things is **Spirit**.\nAll things possess *qi*,\nand **Spirit** and **Essence** are the primal source of *qi*;\nall things possess **numbers** (數),\nand **Spirit** and **Essence** precede the manifestation of **numbers**.\nThus, **Spirit** and **Essence** arise from the Dao—\nbecause the **illuminating** (昭昭) is generated from the **obscure** (冥冥).\n\nHeaven and Earth contain **Essence**,\nand all things are transformed and born—\nthe four seasons disperse **Essence** to become all things,\nand thus the form is born from **Essence**—\nbecause the **ordered** (有倫) is generated from the **formless** (無形).\n\nIf one **embraces Unity** (抱一) without detachment,\nguards them without loss,\nthen **Spirit** is grasped and steadfast,\naligning with **Spirit**—\nhence **Essence** and **Spirit** merge without separation,\nbecause the **ultimate Essence** of the world can merge with the **ultimate Spirit** of the world.\n\nWith **Essence** gathering **Spirit**,\nand **Spirit** not shaken by **Essence**,\nthen **Essence** is complete without depletion.\nWith **Spirit** animating the form,\nand **Spirit** embraced in stillness,\nthen **Spirit** functions without exhaustion.\nWith the form preserving **Spirit**,\nand **Spirit** guarding the form,\nthen the form lives without decay.\n**Essence** complete and **Spirit** complete,\n**Spirit** complete and the form complete—\nlike the sun and moon adorning the sky yet enduringly shining,\nlike grasses and trees adorning the earth yet enduringly standing,\nthey never part.\n\nMoreover, when a person is born,\n**Essence** is the root of the body—\nwhen **Essence** is complete, **Spirit** follows,\nthus **Essence** gathers **Spirit** and the bodily form is complete.\n**Essence** emerges from the **ultimate Yin** (至阴),\n**Spirit** from the **ultimate Yang** (至阳).\nThe Yin **Essence** is water,\nthe Yang **Spirit** is fire.\nWater and fire originally have no form—\nwhen sought with the **balance scale** (镒) and **fire drill** (燧),\nthey naturally arise,\nand thus it is known that **Spirit** and **Essence** flow fourfold and converge—\nreaching all extremes.\n\nThe **ultimate Yin** is solemn and still,\nthe **ultimate Yang** is radiant and vast—\nwhen the two intermingle in harmony,\nthings are born,\nand thus my body and Heaven and Earth share the same root.\nTherefore, it is fitting that above it meets Heaven,\nbelow it coils with Earth,\ntransforming and nurturing all things—\nthis is called **Emperor-like**.\nYet the great fools of the world,\nthroughout their lives, remain unenlightened—\nheavy on externals, light on internals,\ntheir wills chasing ends, abandoning roots,\nenslaving themselves to things,\nlosing their nature in worldly affairs,\ntheir hearts restless and never still,\nunable to even pause for a moment—\nno moment of rest to preserve **Spirit** within,\nexhausted by endless desires,\nthey do not know where their **Spirit** returns,\nabandon **Essence** externally,\nand cannot gather **Essence** to contain the *Hun*—\nthe *Hun* follows *Pò*,\nthey cannot govern the form with **Spirit**,\nthe form burdens **Spirit**—\nunable to distinguish themselves from things,\nthey descend with all things into transformation—\nis this not bewilderment?\n\nThe Sage does not act thus.\nHe aligns the *Pò* with **Spirit** to manifest **Way** and resonate with **Virtue**,\nembraces the **One** to preserve **Stillness** and thus attune with the **Dao**.\n\nWith neither sight nor hearing,\nhe alone guards **Spirit**—\nand by embracing **Spirit** in **Stillness**,\nhe does not diminish its essence.\nCautiously guarding his form,\nhis body naturally rectifies itself.\n\nHis **Spirit** flows through **Great Void** without alteration,\nits vastness unbounded;\ndwells in **Deep Source** without dampness,\nits subtlety unconfined.\n\nApproach it, and you see no beginning—\nwho can trace its origin?\nFollow it, and you find no end—\nwho can grasp its conclusion?\nAll stems from the **One’s** pure penetration.\n\nThus **Zhuangzi** said:\n*\"The Sage focuses on **Essence**.\"*\n**Shun’s** admonition to **Yu** declared:\n*\"Focus only on **Essence**, focus only on the **One**.\"*\nDid he know this truth?\n\nCan you concentrate **Qi** to achieve **Softness**,\nlike the innocence of an infant?\n\n**Emperor Hui’s** annotation states:\n*\"The **Yijing** says: **Qian** [乾], in its **Stillness**, is absolute in focus.\"*\n\n**Yang Xiong** declared:\n*\"Harmonious **Softness** suffices to settle all things.\"*\n\n**Stillness** without distraction is called **focused**,\n**Harmony** without excess is called **soft**.\nAn infant, in repose, knows not what to do,\nin motion, knows not where to go,\nharbors neither judgment of right and wrong\nnor taste for good and evil—\nthus his **Qi** is concentrated,\nachieving **Softness**.\n\n**Mencius** said:\n*\"The faltering and rushing—\nthis is **Qi**,\nyet it disrupts the heart.\"*\n\nIf the heart cannot focus **Qi**,\nthen **Qi** falters and rushes unnaturally,\nand the heart grows **arrogant and unchecked**—\nunable to be contained.\n\nThe Sage empties himself to engage the world,\nhis heart free from forcing **Qi**—\nthus his **Stillness** remains undistracted,\nhis **Harmony** unexcessive—\nwhat difference lies between him and an infant?\nHence it is said: *\"Can you be like an infant?\"*\n\n**Mencius** also said:\n*\"When **Qi** is at its utmost vast and firm,\nnourished upright without harm,\nit fills the space between Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nYet **Laozi** spoke of concentrating **Qi** to achieve **Softness**—\nwhy so?\n\nUtmost **Firmness** aligns with **Righteousness**,\n**Softness** returns to **Nature**—\nancient **Dao/Way** and its techniques\nare nowhere absent.\n\nThe **Annotations** state:\n*\"The **Yijing**, in the **Xìcí** [系辞], says:\n**Qian** [乾], in its **Stillness**, is absolute in focus.*\n*Its focus comes from **Stillness**—\nthus **focused** means **Stillness** without clinging.*\n\n*Yang Xiong, in the **Tàixuān** [太玄], says:\n**Harmonious Softness** suffices to settle all things.*\n*Its **Softness** settles all things through **Harmony**—\nthus **soft** means **Harmony** without excess.*\n\nMoreover, in human life within the **Great Transformation** [大化], there are four stages:\nIn infancy, before thoughts take form,\nhis repose is not from intent to still—\nthus he rests without knowing what to do.\nHis motion is not from intent to act—\nthus he moves without knowing where to go.\nFollowing **Nature** and yielding to **Principle**,\nfree from contrivance,\nhe harbors neither judgment of right and wrong\nnor taste for good and evil—\nthus his **Qi** is **Stillness** without distraction,\ncapable of **Softness** without excess.\n\nIndeed, **Will** commands **Qi** like a general,\na unified **Will** suffices to move **Qi**.\n**Mencius** said:\n*\"The faltering and rushing—\nthis is **Qi**,\nyet it disrupts the heart.\"*\n\nThus, concentrating **Qi** originates from the heart’s **One** and unchanging nature.\nIf **One** and unchanging,\nthen all things cannot sway the heart,\nand **Qi** naturally concentrates.\n\nIf the heart fails to focus **Qi**,\nthen **Qi** falters and rushes unnaturally,\nand the heart grows **arrogant and unchecked**—\nunable to be contained.\nThis is like a strong beam\nnot bending to avoid death—\nhow can it remain like an infant?\n\nThe Sage empties himself to wander through the world,\nand when adversity comes,\nhe regards it as a **hollow boat** drifting on **floating tiles**,\nthus able to preserve **Softness**.\nHis heart, free from forcing **Qi**,\nwhat difference lies between him and an infant?\n\n**Mencius** said:\n*\"When **Qi** is at its utmost vast and firm,\nnourished upright without harm,\nit fills the space between Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nYet **Laozi** spoke of concentrating **Qi** to achieve **Softness**—\nwhy so?\n\nUtmost **Vastness** aligns with the **Dao/Way**,\nutmost **Firmness** aligns with **Righteousness**.\n**Mencius** spoke of utmost **Firmness**,\nemphasizing **action in Righteousness**,\ndiscussing **Qi’s** application.\n**Laozi** spoke of **Softness**,\nemphasizing **return to Nature**,\ndiscussing **Qi’s** root.\n\nIf **Guan Yin** [关尹] takes its **pure Qi** [纯气],\nand **Huzi** [壶子] takes its **balanced Qi** [衡气],\ntheir words each hold truth—\nthus it is.\n\nThe ancient spread of the **Dao/Way**,\nnowhere absent—\nthis is why.\n\n**Purification** and **profound insight**,\ncan they be without flaw?\n\n**Emperor Hui’s** annotation states:\n*\"The Sage uses this to cleanse the heart,\nthus purifying all actions without attachment.\nHe uses this to retreat and hide in **secrecy** [密],\nthus gazing into **mysteries** and recognizing **principles** in silence.\"*\n\nIf such is the case,\nhis **body** remains **pure and simple** without burden,\nhis errors pass without regret,\nhis actions align without self-congratulation—\nwhat flaw could there be?\n\nThe **Annotations** state:\n*\"The ancients held that before **things** began to exist was **unattained** [未至],\nand only when reaching **before things began to exist** [未始有物]\nwas it **attained**—\nthus **purification** of all actions without attachment.\nUsing this to cleanse the heart,\nwho could have even a hair’s breadth of disturbance?\nThat which has **words** and **nearness** is not **true** [真],\nand only when reaching **forgetting words and ceasing contrivance** [忘言息迩]\nis it **true**—\nthus **profound insight**

**pure and simple** without burden,\nunmixed with anything, undiminished.\nHis **Spirit** rides the **times** [时] to act,\nthough errors occur,\nin **times** he cannot avoid them—\nthus errors pass

be?\"\n\nTo love the people and govern the realm,\ncan one be without **action** [为]?\n\n**Emperor Hui’s** annotation states:\n*\"With **benevolence** [仁] to love the people,\nwith **wisdom** [智] to

process,\nunable to master themselves—\nis this not the greatest sorrow?\n\n*(Explanatory commentary:)*\nPeople eat grains and livestock,\ndeer and elk eat grasses,\nminnows and maggots eat snakes,\nowls and crows feast on mice—\nwhich knows the Dao’s true flavor?\nThe true flavor is the Dao’s utterance:\nsubtle, without taste.\n\nAll know the flavors they crave are shared,\nyet they do not know the flavor of the Dao exists—\nthus they take grains, livestock, and rice as sufficient.\nYet rich flavors are truly poisonous,\nthough they may nourish the body,\nthey lose the greater essence.\nThis is why the five flavors leave the mouth parched.\n\n*(Note: Parched—meaning errant.)*\nThe mouth parched loses its true flavor.\nMoreover, human life is brief and small—\nwhat belongs to humanity is a body not exceeding a few feet,\nyet vast is the heart that aligns with the cosmos,\ncompanion to the transformations of nature.\n\nThe Sage exhausts the truth of the heart,\nmoves and weaves the myriad directions—\nthen flows unrestricted, without question.\nIn stillness, he weighs heaven and earth—\nthen illuminates boundlessly, without limit.\nNow he governs the six *qi*’s distinctions,\nto wander the boundless—\nwhy then engage in hunting and trapping?\n\nThe ignorant do not know:\nto conquer oneself is strength.\nThey labor only in chasing and pursuing,\nsometimes stumbling in haste to agitate the heart,\nyet cannot find themselves—\nand thus lose their true heart.\nIs this not called great sorrow?\n\nRare treasures obstruct one’s conduct.\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** *Li* nourishes people, but *huò* transforms them—\nthus, when *li* and *huò* interact, both are sustained.\n\nThe Sage does not prize rare treasures,\ndoes not prize curiosities,\nholds common goods in low regard—\nwishing people to rest content in their allotted portion,\nwithout coveting.\n\nTo prize rare treasures\nleads to neglecting the essence of life and death,\nyet gluttonously seeking wealth and rank—\nwhat conduct can endure this?\nThus, rare treasures obstruct one’s path.\n\n**Zhonghu’s praise of Tang** says:\n*\"Do not cultivate wealth and profit.\"*\n**Confucius told Zigong:**\n*\"You, Shì, did not receive your mandate yet engage in commerce—\"*\nSo great is the obstruction of wealth to conduct.\n\n**Explanatory Notes** say:\nThe ancient kings encouraged migration,\nharmonizing abundance and scarcity,\nto enrich and circulate wealth,\nso that *li* and *huò* interact and both are sustained.\nIndeed, *li* nourishes people,\nbut when transformed, it becomes *huò*—\nthus, when *li* and *huò* interact, both are sustained.\n\nRare treasures—\nclothing that cannot be worn,\nfood that cannot be eaten—\nif these are prized,\nthen one neglects the essence of life and death,\nyet gluttonously seeks wealth and rank,\nplundering and deceiving without restraint.\nTo make people rest in the essence of life and death,\nonly conduct can guard this—\nhow difficult!\n\nThus, the Sage does not prize curiosities,\nholds common goods in low regard—\nfor no other reason\nthan to make people content in their portion,\nwithout coveting.\n\nTherefore, he discards gold on the rugged peaks,\ncasts pearls into the Five Lakes’ depths—\nnot prizing rare treasures,\nso that nourishment for self and others is complete,\nand none are obstructed in their path.\n\n**Zhonghu’s praise of Tang** says:\n*\"Do not cultivate wealth and profit.\"*\n—meaning that *li* should not govern the conduct of the noble.\n\n**Confucius told Zigong:**\n*\"You, Shì, did not receive your mandate yet engage in commerce—\"*\n—to admonish that *li* is not the conduct of the gentleman.\n\n**Zhuangzi** desired to shatter jade and destroy pearls,\nvaluing instead those who do not covet wealth—\nfor this reason.\n\nThus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes—\nhence, he discards the latter to take the former.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe *guà* of *Kūn* is the belly—\nthick and bearing, containing all.\nThe *guà* of *Lí* are the eyes—\nouterly perceiving, brightly discerning.\nThick and bearing, it receives all without discrimination,\ncollecting and storing—\nnothing is left out, nothing is rejected—\nthus, it receives without limit.\nOuterly perceiving, it cannot help but distinguish—\nit sees a hundred paces away,\nyet cannot see its own eyelashes—\nthus, it has its limits.\n\nThe Sage effaces distinctions,\nunifies good and evil,\ntaking the world as measure—\nthus, he takes this containing belly,\nwithout partiality or selection,\nwithout taking or discarding,\nnot governing each matter or scrutinizing each thing.\nHence, he discards those outer-seeing eyes.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said:\n*\"No thief is greater than virtue with a heart,\nand a heart with eyes.\"*\nThus, the Sage rejects them.\n\n**Explanatory Notes** say:\n*Kūn* is thick and bearing, containing all things,\nnurturing and transforming with radiance—\ntaken near to the body, it is the belly,\nthick and bearing, containing all.\nOuter *yáng*, inner *yīn*—\nthe two *yáng* make *Lí*, taken near to the body, are the eyes,\nouterly perceiving, brightly discerning.\n\nThick and bearing, it never discriminates—\ncollecting and storing, nothing is left out, nothing is rejected—\nthus, it receives without limit.\nOuterly perceiving, it cannot help but distinguish—\nit sees a hundred paces away,\nyet cannot see its own eyelashes—\nthus, it has its limits.\n\nThe Sage effaces distinctions,\nunifies good and evil,\ntaking the world as measure—\nthus, he takes this containing belly,\nwithout partiality or selection,\nwithout taking or discarding,\nnot governing each matter or scrutinizing each thing.\nHence, he discards those outer-seeing eyes.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said:\n*\"No thief is greater than virtue with a heart,\nand a heart with eyes.\"*\nIndeed, *dé* opens heaven,\nbut *zéi* (harm) opens humanity—\na heart with eyes opens humanity and brings harm—\nthus, the Sage does not make them eyes.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: On Honor and Humiliation**\nHonor and humiliation are like a startling fright,\ngreat calamities are like a threat to one’s life.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nHonor is below, rank is above—\nto dwell in honor and take it as pride is humiliation.\nTo dwell in rank and take it as a burden is no greater calamity.\nThose who regard wealth as right cannot refuse office,\nthose who regard eminence as right cannot refuse fame.\nThose who cling to power cannot entrust it to others—\nto hold it makes one tremble,\nto relinquish it brings sorrow.\nThis is why honor and humiliation are like a startling fright?\n\nPain and anguish, ease and contentment—\nthese gather in the body,\nurgent dread and joyful delight—\nthese drown the heart.\nThis is why great calamities are like a threat to one’s life?\n\n**Explanatory Notes** say:\nHonor is what people prize—\nthe way of those below.\nRank is what people burden themselves with—\nthe way of those above.\nTo dwell in honor and take it as pride is to exhaust its fullness—\nexhaust its fullness, and it becomes humiliation.\nOr, to dwell in rank and take it as a burden is to be proud of one’s rank—\nto be proud of one’s rank is no greater calamity.\n\nThose who regard wealth as right cannot refuse office—\nburdened by abundant gain.\nThose who regard eminence as right cannot refuse fame—\nburdened by high renown.\nThose who cling to power cannot entrust it to others—\nbecause power and authority are not uniquely theirs,\nthe proud then grow sorrowful.\nThus, these three:\nto hold them brings trembling—\nthis is *\"having gained it, fearing to lose it\"*—\nto relinquish them brings sorrow—\nthis is *\"parting with it, finding no joy\"*—\nthus, honor and humiliation are like a startling fright?\n\nWhat gathers in the body—\nif not pain and anguish from the assault of *yīn* and *yáng*,\nthen ease and contentment.\nWhat drowns the heart in human affairs—\nif not urgent dread from proximity to *yīn*,\nthen joyful delight from leaning toward *yáng*.\nThe myriad breaths of one’s life rise and clash—\nto dwell in rank and take it as a burden,\nits calamities are no different.\n\n「Why does this great *qi* weigh upon one like the body?\nWhat is meant by *\"honor and humiliation\"*?\nHonor is low—\n*Huizong*’s annotation says: The dragon, as a creature,\nshifts and transforms at will,\nunrestrained, impossible to tame.\nIf it can be covered by the ancient [ritual],\nthen its spirit is set on domestication—\nthis is the path of humiliation.\n\nThe ancients who excelled in *shi*’s way:\nThe rank of three *jīng* flags was insufficient to shake their resolve,\nthe wealth of ten thousand *chóng* measures could not shift their steadfastness.\nTo dwell in favor yet ponder peril,\nto hold fortune yet act as though empty—\nthen what humiliation could there be?\n\nTo covet rank and crave wealth,\nto know advancement yet not retreat,\nto grasp gain yet not foresee loss—\nthen one is already debased.\nThus, to receive favor from others\nis the way of the lowly.\n\nThe *Shūyì* elaborates:\nThe heavens’ matchless transformations are like the dragon—\nunited, it forms a body;\nscattered, it becomes a pattern.\nThis is shifting and transforming at will,\nunrestrained, impossible to tame.\n\nUnable to see yet unable to contain [its nature],\nit has not yet escaped the ancient [ritual]’s cover—\nif one strives to domesticate it for harness and riding,\nthen regret is inevitable.\nThis is why—\nif it can be covered by the ancient [ritual],\nthen its spirit is set on domestication—\nthis is the path of humiliation.\n\nThe reason honor becomes humiliation\nis thus.\n\nTherefore, the ancients who excelled in *shi*’s way:\nThe rank of three *jīng* flags was insufficient to shake their resolve,\nfor they knew that what lies within me\nis nobler than the rank of three *jīng* flags.\nThe wealth of ten thousand *chóng* measures could not shift their steadfastness,\nfor they knew that what lies within me\nis richer than ten thousand *chóng* measures.\n\nTo master the art of retaining favor,\none dwells in favor yet ponders peril;\nto grasp the way of preserving fortune,\none holds fortune yet acts as though empty—\nthus, they can endure wealth and rank without losing themselves,\nand their blessings and fortunes endure long and steady.\nWhat humiliation could there be?\n\nIf one covets rank yet falsifies oneself to gain nobility,\nor craves wealth yet indulges in corruption to gain riches,\nknowing advancement yet not retreat,\nobscuring the logic of growth and decline,\ngrasping gain yet not foreseeing loss,\nignoring the cycles of fullness and emptiness—\nthen the nobility of *Zhao Meng*\nis but a step toward debasement.\n\nThus, to receive favor from others\nis the way of the lowly.\n\nTo gain it is like a startling fright,\nto lose it is like a startling fright—\nthis is *\"honor and humiliation are like a startling fright\"*.\n\n*Huizong*’s annotation says:\nThe cap and robes upon one’s person\nare not the Dao/Way of life and death.\nExternal things arrive like transient guests—\nif they come, they cannot be refused;\nthus, the sage does not take delight in gaining them.\nIf they depart, they cannot be detained—\nthus, the sage does not sorrow over losing them.\nYet now, if they depart, one finds no joy,\nand if received, one takes pleasure—\nso gain and loss burden the heart,\nhow could one not be startled?\n\n*Liu Xià Huì* served as a magistrate,\nthrice dismissed yet refusing to leave,\n*Zhèng Kǎo Fù* received three commands,\nyet fled along the walls—\nhow different from this!\n\nThe *Shūyì* elaborates:\nTrue nobility lies within oneself—\nenough to rival the titles of a kingdom.\nYet the cap and robes upon one’s person\nare not the Dao/Way of life and death.\nExternal things cannot be clung to,\nand seeking them brings no benefit to what is already gained—\nfor they arrive like transient guests.\nOnly time is without end,\nso their coming cannot be refused,\nand their gain—\nwhat does it add to me?\nThus, the sage does not take delight in gaining them.\n\nOnly division is without permanence,\nso their departure cannot be detained—\nand their loss—\nwhat harm does it bring to me?\nThus, the sage does not sorrow over losing them.\nThe deluded do not understand the extremes of destitution and abundance,\nlike the sequence of winter and summer—\nif they depart, one finds no joy,\nor one may fall into poverty and lowliness.\nIf received, one takes pleasure,\nor one may be bent by wealth and rank.\nGain and loss wage war within the chest,\neven the spirit platform is obstructed—\nhow few escape being startled!\n\n*Liu Xià Huì* served as a magistrate,\nthrice dismissed yet refusing to leave,\n*Zhèng Kǎo Fù* received three commands,\nyet fled along the walls—\ncould it be that gain and loss burdened their hearts?\nWhat is meant by *\"the greatest calamity of nobility is like the body\"*?\n\n*Huizong*’s annotation says:\nTo grasp advantage and power,\nto monopolize rewards and punishments,\nto wield blessings and threats—\nthe world fears them like gods and reveres them like emperors.\nThis is nobility indeed.\n\nYet the sage does not let nobility weigh upon them,\nso they can long endure nobility without exhaustion.\nLike a person whose limbs and body fall into ruin,\nwhose ears and eyes lose their acuity,\nwho abandons form yet is not bound by it,\nwho discards wisdom yet does not cling to it—\nto merge with the Great Unity,\nthen there is none who does not find themselves at ease.\nThe world’s people exchange their nature for things,\nso they are burdened by things yet cannot forget their power.\nThey let form weigh upon the heart,\nso they lose the heart yet cannot forget form—\ntheir calamity is great.\n\nThe *Shūyì* elaborates:\nTo dwell in nobility as one’s own,\none cannot escape exhaustion—\nonly if one does not claim nobility as one’s own\ncan one truly guard it.\nLike a person’s body:\nto think it is mine brings constant hindrance;\nto know the body is not truly mine,\nthen one can preserve it.\n\nNow, if one grasps the weight of advantage and power,\nholds the authority of rewards and punishments,\nand monopolizes the tools of blessings and threats—\nthe world fears them like gods and reveres them like emperors,\ntheir nobility is unmatched.\nYet only the sage, wielding the void to govern the full,\ndoes not dwell in nobility as their own—\nso though they are noble, they suffer no exhaustion.\n\nLike a person’s body:\nto contain the hundred bones yet let limbs falter,\nto embody ears and eyes yet let wisdom dim,\nto abandon form yet not be constrained by it,\nto discard wisdom yet not cling to it—\nthen one attains Great Permeation,\nconstructing the formless,\nand there is none who does not find themselves at ease.\nWho could take the body as exhaustion?\n\nThe vulgar and shallow cannot exhaust their nature while fixating on power,\nso they are burdened by things, exchanging their nature for them;\nthey cannot exhaust their heart while clinging to form,\nso they are weighed down by form, losing their heart.\nTo exchange one’s nature for things,\nto let form weigh upon the heart—\ntheir calamity is great.\n\nThe reason I have great calamity\nis that I have a body.\nWhen I have no body,\nwhat calamity could I have?\n\n*Huizong*’s annotation says:\nHuman birth—\nthe hundred bones, nine orifices, six viscera are complete and stored within.\nWho could I truly call my own?\nTo recognize and claim them all\nis but delusion.\nThose who embody the Dao understand this,\nso Confucius said:\n*\"Morning hearing of the Dao,\nevening death would be acceptable.\"*\nMencius said:\n*\"Life and death are not two separate things.\"*\nYan Ziyuan said:\n*\"Yan [Child] sat and forgot himself.\"*」\n\nThe greatness of life and death is vast indeed,\nyet it does not alter one’s self—\nhow much more so the gains and losses, calamities and blessings, that lie between them?\n\nThis has no other cause\nthan knowing that within one’s form and body dwell the true *Dao/Way* and sovereign.\nThus, the *Zhi Ren* of antiquity\ndid not let profit weigh upon their form,\nnor did their form weigh upon their heart.\nThey saw all things as inseparable from themselves,\nyet could not choose among them—\nthen their body was not truly theirs.\n\nAbove, they played with the *造物者* [Creator],\nbelow, they befriended the external, endless life and death.\nWho could truly weary them?\nFavored by the world, yet they took it as dishonor;\nheld in esteem by all, yet they saw it as no burden—\nfor they knew the external things could not be relied upon,\nand this was the natural order.\n\nIf one can truly possess without possessing,\nthen though favored, they would not be shamed,\nthough esteemed, they would not be weary.\nYi Yin did not dwell on favor and success,\nwhile Yao did not take his position as pleasure—\nthis is nearly it.\n\n*Huizong*’s annotation says:\nThe world is a great vessel,\nbut only the *Dao/Way* can move it;\nthe world is a divine vessel,\nbut only the *Dao/Way* can guard it.\nThe sage embodies the *Dao/Way*,\nso when they govern the world, the world finds joy in their benevolence without tiring.\nThe lesser ones know that to value their body is not to demean themselves in serving things,\nas though they could entrust it—\nto love their body is not to harm themselves in being constrained by things,\nas though they could rely upon it.\n\nThus it is said:\nThe true *Dao/Way* is used to govern oneself,\nits remnants to govern the state,\nand its dregs to govern the world.\nThe vulgar *junzi* of the world\nendanger their body and abandon their life to serve things—\nis this not tragic?\n\nThe *Shu Yi* says:\nWithin the six directions and beyond,\nthere is no end or limit—\nthe world is a great vessel.\nThere must be what transcends the vessel\nbefore it can be moved—\nwhat transcends the vessel is the *Dao/Way*.\nEstablished in the unfathomable,\nacting without fixed methods—\nthe world is a divine vessel.\nThere must be what aligns with the divine\nbefore it can be guarded—\nwhat aligns with the divine is the *Dao/Way*.\nThe sage embodies this within themselves,\nso they govern the world without corrupting their nature,\nbear the world’s burdens without altering their *virtue/power*,\nand from west to east, from south to north,\nnone do not submit—\nthe world finds joy in their benevolence without tiring.\n\nThe lesser ones understand that things are not truly things,\nyet they do not know how to govern the world.\nThey know that one limb is heavier than one kingdom,\ntwo arms are heavier than the world,\nand the body is heavier than two arms—\nto value their body is not to harm themselves,\nto love their body is not to demean themselves—\nas though they could entrust and rely upon it.\n\nIs it not that they mutilate life and harm their nature,\nsacrificing their body—\nrestlessly enslaved by things,\nwearily burdened by things,\nnot knowing the way to preserve themselves?\n\nThis is exactly what Zhuangzi meant by:\nThe true *Dao/Way* is used to govern oneself,\nits remnants to govern the state,\nand its dregs to govern the world.\n\nThe vulgar *junzi* of the world do not know that the body is the master of life,\nso they kill their body to achieve fame,\nuse many means to destroy their life,\nchase after things without returning—\nendangering their body and abandoning their life to follow things,\nlike using the *Su Hou’s pearl* to shoot a thousand *ren*-high sparrow,\nlosing far more than they gain—\nis this not tragic?\n\n**Chapter 14: The Vision That Does Not See Forms**\nThe vision that does not see forms is called *yi* [level/plain].\n\n*Huizong*’s annotation says:\nThe eyes are the master of vision,\nvision is used to distinguish things—\n*yi* is level and without distinction,\nnot within the reach of vision,\nso it is called *yi*.\n\nThe *Tai Yi* [Great Oneness] is unseen,\nyet *qi* is already there.\n\nThe *Shu Yi* says:\nHeaven gives birth to wood in threes,\nwhich in humans becomes the liver—\nthe liver opens to the eyes,\nso in the five *zang* organs, it governs vision.\nThus the eyes are the master of vision.\n\nThe *ming liang* [clear vision] is *li* [separation] in two,\nsymbolized in the eyes,\nand the eyes, regarding colors,\nunite only after seeing—\nthus vision is used to distinguish things.\n\nYet when vision can see,\nit has not yet separated from colors—\nwhether high or low,\nit can be distinguished.\nThe wondrous *Dao/Way* is not a color—\ngreen and empty, void and empty,\nnot the slightest trace or sign—\nvision is insufficient to see it.\nIts level and boundless nature—\nwho could distinguish high from low?\n\nThe *Liezi* states: *The Tai Yi* [Great Oneness] is unseen, yet *qi* is already there.\n\nIn the beginning of *hunlun* [chaotic unity], *qi* has not yet manifested, its level and boundless nature is known, hence it is called *yi* [evenness].\n\nWhen hearing does not hear, it is called *xi* [subtle/rare].\n\nThe *Huizong* [Emperor Huizong] annotated: The ears govern hearing, and hearing is used to discern things. *Xi* [subtle/rare] implies a faintness with gaps, beyond what hearing can perceive—hence it is called *xi*.\n\n*The great sound, rare and faint, is already there.*\n\nThe *Shu Yi* [loose exposition] says:\nHeaven one gives birth to water,\nin the *zang* [viscera] it becomes the kidneys—\nthe kidneys open to the ears,\nso in the five *zang* organs, it governs hearing,\nand thus the ears are the master of hearing.\n\nWater reaching its extreme becomes *kan* [the abyss],\nsymbolized in the ears,\nand the ears, regarding sounds,\ndistinguish them only after perception—\nthus hearing is used to discern things.\n\nYet when hearing can perceive,\nit has not yet separated from sounds—\nwhether clear or murky,\nnone can distinguish them.\n\nThe wondrous *Dao/Way* has no sound—\nstill and vast, *leao* [silent and empty],\nnever the slightest echo or resonance,\nhearing is insufficient to perceive it.\n\nThe wind ceases, the rustling subsides,\nfaint and with gaps—\nthe *jing* [classic] says: *The great sound, rare and faint, is already there.*\n\nIt moves without direction,\ndwells in the *yaoming* [profoundly obscure],\nits faintness is known—\nhence it is called *xi*.\n\nWhen it cannot be grasped, it is called *wei* [minute].\n\nThe *Huizong* annotated: *Minute, how minute!*—\nreaching the point of formlessness,\nwho could grasp it?\n\n*The great form is formless, is already there.*\n\nThe *Shu Yi* says:\nWhen *qi* transforms, only then does form arise,\nand when form arises, it can be perceived.\n\nThe essence of the *Dao/Way* is profoundly obscure—\nbefore anything began,\nfollowing it, yet unable to grasp it—\nthis is called *minute, how minute!*\nreaching the point of formlessness.\n\nWhen form exists, it can be grasped,\nbut the *Dao/Way*’s formlessness—\nwho could grasp it?\n\nThe *jing* [classic] says: *The great form is formless*—\nthen what form is greater than the *Dao/Way*?\n\nIt is only because it is formless,\nthat its greatness knows no bounds.\n\nThese three cannot be defined with precision—\nhence they merge into one.\n\nThe *Huizong* annotated:\n*The Tai Yi* [Great Oneness] is undifferentiated—\nwho could distinguish high from low?\n\n*The great sound, rare and faint*—\nwho could discern clear from murky?\n\n*The great form is formless*—\nwho could define vast from minute?\n\nThe eyes have no use for their brightness,\nthe ears no application for their sharpness,\nthe body no exertion for its strength—\nhere lies the *Dao/Way*'s complete essence.\n\nIt cannot be exhausted by inquiry,\nnor attained by exploration.\n\nWhen *qi*, form, and substance are present yet undivided,\nthus they merge into one.\n\nYet once they have become one,\nhow could it not be called *formless*?\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] says:\n*The Tai Yi* [Great Oneness] is yet unjudged—\nthe *Liezi*’s \"color-color\" never reveals this.\n\"Color-color\" is without color,\nhow could it distinguish high from low?\n\n*The great sound is faint*—\nthe *Liezi*’s \"sound-sound\" never emits this.\n\"Sound-sound\" is without sound,\nhow could it discern clear from murky?\n\n*The great form is formless*—\nthe *Liezi*’s \"shape-shape\" never displays this.\n\"Shape-shape\" is without form,\nhow could it define vast from minute?\n\nEven if *Lizhu* [legendary seer] were to polish his eyes at noon and gaze,\nhe would still not perceive its form—\nthus the eyes have no use for their brightness.\n\nEven if *Shigang* [master of hearing] were to bow his head all night and strain his ears,\nhe would still not hear its sound—\nthus the ears have no application for their sharpness.\n\nEven if the wisest and most voracious scholars were to search endlessly,\nthey would never attain it—\nthus the body has no exertion for its strength.\n\nFrom its unseen aspect, it is called *formless*;\nfrom its unheard aspect, it is called *faint*;\nfrom its untouchable aspect, it is called *minute*.\n\nThese three share the same essence though different names,\npointing to one reality—\nhere lies the *Dao/Way*'s complete essence.\n\nIt cannot be exhausted by inquiry,\nnor attained by exploration—\nthis is the *Liezi*’s \"indistinct and chaotic.\"\n\nCalled \"indistinct and chaotic,\"\nit is because *qi*, form, and substance are present yet undivided,\nand they have not yet separated.\n\nOnce they have become one,\nhow could it not be called *formless*?\n\nIts uppermost aspect is not *illuminated*,\nits lowermost aspect is not *obscured*.\n\nThe *Huizong* annotated:\nThat which is beyond form—\nthe inscrutable interplay of *yin* and *yang*,\ndark yet not easily lost—\nthis is called *ultimate mystery*, hence not *illuminated*.\n\"Illuminated\" means \"bright,\" and not *illuminated* means profound and difficult to know.\n\nThat which is beneath form—\none *yin*, one *yang*,\ndistinct yet numbered—\nthis is called *ultimate Dao/Way*, hence not *obscured*.\n\"Obscured\" means \"dark,\" and not *obscured* means clear and discernible.\n\nThe *Yijing* [Classic of Changes] says:\n*The mysterious and the bright*—\nthis depends on the person.\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] says:\nThat which is beyond form is called *Dao/Way*,\nand the mysterious is indeed its marvel.\nThus the mysterious is inherently beyond form.\n\n*Yin* knows the mysterious exists within *yin*,\nyet does not know it also exists within *yang*;\n*Yang* knows the mysterious exists within *yang*,\nyet does not know it also exists within *yin*.\nHence the mysterious is inscrutable in *yin* and *yang*.\n\nSwift yet not hasty, moving yet not arriving,\nlost yet truly present—\nthis is called the uppermost not *illuminated*.\n\nThat which is beneath form is called *instrumentality*,\nyet the *Dao/Way* truly resides within it—\nthus the *Dao/Way* is also beneath form.\n\nIt does not lean toward *yang* alone,\nnor is it born solely from *yang*;\nit does not cling to *yin* alone,\nnor is it formed solely from *yin*.\nHence the *Dao/Way* is one *yin* and one *yang*.\n\nIt can be confined, it can be dispersed,\nin the void yet manifest—\nthis is called the lowermost not *obscured*.\n\nFor \"illuminated\" and \"illuminated\" are as the same,\n\"illuminated\" meaning \"bright\"—\nnot *illuminated* means profound and difficult to know.\n\nFor \"obscured\" and \"obscured\" are as the same,\n\"obscured\" meaning \"dark\"—\nnot *obscured* means clear and discernible.\n\nYet if not the person,\nthe *Dao/Way* does not act in vain—\nthus it is said: *The mysterious and the bright*—\nthis depends on the person.\n\nBoundless yet nameless,\nit returns to *non-existence*.\n\nThe *Huizong* annotated:\nThe *Dao/Way*'s essence—\nlike the regular succession of day and night,\nyet its profound and bright nature is unfathomable.\nCould it be captured in appearance, sound, or color?\nHence it returns to *non-existence*.\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] says:\nThe *Dao/Way*’s *thread*—\nlike the measure of things,\nensuring nothing strays from its straightness.\n\"Boundless\" means it does not exceed the limits of regulation and scrutiny.\n\nThe *Dao/Way*'s *pattern* is orderly yet not disordered,\nlike the regular succession of day and night—\none dark, one bright, never failing.\nHence it is called \"boundless.\"\n\nYet profound and marvelously obscure,\nit has no name, no nameable origin,\nand its profound and bright nature is unfathomable—\nthus it cannot be named.\n\nIf so, then it returns to its root,\nleaving not even a trace,\nnot only *non-existence* at the beginning,\nbut also *non-existence* beyond the beginning of *non-existence*—\nhow could it be captured in appearance, sound, or color?\nThis is called returning to *non-existence*.\n\nThis is called *the state of the stateless*,\nthe *form of the formless*—\nthis is called *dimly discernible*.\n\nThe *Huizong* annotated:\n*The state of the stateless*,\nthe *form of the formless*—\ndimly discernible, yet within it is substance;\nobscure, yet within it are forms.\n\nLike the *Great Void* [Tai Xu] containing all forms,\nyet not revealing their outlines.\n\nLike one *nature* [xing], one *spiritual intelligence*

their reflection or fire in their rays,\nthe water and fire arrive without delay.\n\nWhere do the water and fire truly reside?\n*The state of the stateless*,\nthe *form of the formless*—\nthis is the same.\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] says:\nThere is a state, hence it can be seen,\nyet the *Dao/Way* is unseen—\nalso not separate from seeing—\nthus it is the *state of the stateless*.\n\nThere is a form, hence it can be represented,\nyet the *Dao/Way* is formless—\nalso not separate from form—\nthus it is the *form of the formless*.\n\n*The state of the stateless*,\nthe *form of the formless*—\nit suggests \"having yet not having,\"\ndimly discernible yet containing substance,\nit suggests \"not having yet not having,\"\nobscure yet containing forms—\nlike the *Great Void* [Tai Xu],\none void giving rise to all things,\nyet never confined,\ncontaining all forms without revealing their outlines.\n\nLike one *nature* [xing] without *nature*,\nresponding to all things without end,\ndeep yet unfathomable,\nspiritual intelligence self-sufficient,\nyet its marvelous workings are unfathomable.\n\nIt is having yet not having,\nhaving in reality yet not having;\nit is not having yet having,\nnot having in reality yet having.\n\nAs when the sun and moon are distant from people,\nyet seeking water in the moon’s reflection\nor fire in the sun’s rays with a *square mirror*

Virtuous Way* [shànwéi shì] were subtle, wondrous, and profound—so deep as to be unrecognizable.\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: The ancient *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shì] differed from that of today, and the masters who excelled in it differed from those who did not.\nThus, subtlety [wēi] aligns with the Dao, wondrousness [miào] harmonizes with the *Divine* [shén], profundity [yuān] matches the heavens, and penetration [tōng] reveals the *Sage’s* [shèng] essence. Yet, their depths are so concealed that they cannot be measured.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* [Shū] says: *\"The Dao’s heart is but subtle.\"* [dàoxīn wéi wēi]\nThus, subtlety [wēi] is the Dao itself.\nThe *Book of Changes* [Yì] says: *\"The Divine, indeed, is wondrous in all things and is named thus.\"* [shén yě zhě miào wànwù ér wéi yán]\nThus, wondrousness [miào] is the Divine.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *\"The heavens are profound, and the earth is vast.\"* [tiān xuán ér dì huáng]\nThus, profundity [yuān] is the color of the heavens.\nThe *Commentary* [Zhuàn] says: *\"There is no obstruction in all things—this is called the Sage.\"* [shì wú bù tōng zhī wéi shèng]\nThus, penetration [tōng] is the Sage’s work.\nThe depths of water can be measured, and the depths of pits can be explored.\nYet the ancient masters of the *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shànwéi shì], their names and deeds unseen, awaken responses from the heels—so profound that they cannot be measured or explored.\nLü Yu was in Zhengpu for forty years, yet no one recognized him.\nLaozi spoke to Confucius: *\"A fine merchant hides his wares as if they were none; a Sage of virtue, though full of power, appears as if foolish.\"*\nIs this what he meant?\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* [Shūyì] states: There was the Upper Antiquity, and the Middle Antiquity; the ancient *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shì] refers to the Upper Antiquity.\nThere were the Upper Masters [shàngshì] and the Lower Masters [xiàshì]; the masters who excelled in the *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shànwéi shì] were of the Upper Master class.\nThus, the ancient *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shì] differed from that of today, and the masters who excelled in it differed from those who did not.\nThe masters who excelled in the *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shànwéi shì] possessed talents reaching the heavens, their aspirations aligned with the Dao and the Divine, their wisdom matched the heavens, and their penetration the Sage’s.\nSo profound as to be unmeasurable, they were subtle, wondrous, profound, and penetrating—deep beyond recognition.\nFor they were unseen in form, the Dao had no shape, and could not be perceived by the eyes—only known subtly, hence their unity with the Dao.\nThis is what the *Book of Documents* [Shū] meant by *\"The Dao’s heart is but subtle.\"* [dàoxīn wéi wēi]\nThe Divine’s wondrousness is without desire—only those who enter wondrousness can know it, for it cannot be sought with fixed expectations.\nThis is what the *Book of Changes* [Yì] meant by *\"The Divine is wondrous in all things.\"* [shén miào wànwù]\nProfoundity [yuān] as the heavens’ hue bears both *qi* [chì] and *essence* [yáng], for it can embrace both yin and yang.\nThus, the heavens’ color is in this, as the *Book of Changes* [Yì] says: *\"The heavens are profound, and the earth is vast.\"* [tiān xuán ér dì huáng]\nIf one can be profound and vast, then one aligns with the heavens.\nPenetration [tōng] means unrestricted passage—nothing can obstruct it.\nThus, the Sage’s work is in this, as the *Commentary* [Zhuàn] says: *\"There is no obstruction in all things—this is called the Sage.\"* [shì wú bù tōng zhī wéi shèng]\nIf one aligns with the *Great Penetration* [Dàtōng], then one enters the Sage’s domain.\nThe ancient masters of the *Dao’s Virtuous Way* [shànwéi shì], subtle, wondrous, profound, and penetrating—so deep as to be unrecognizable—are like the heavens and earth.\nAs the following passage states, they are but named in approximation.\n*\"Cautious as one crossing a river in winter,\nhesitant as if fearing four neighbors.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"Cautious\"* [yù] means to plan rest before action.\n*\"Hesitant\"* [yóu] means to consider doubt after completion.\nThe ancient ones who embodied the Dao took inner cultivation as their duty, not outer penetration as their delight.\nThey lived in constant fear and reflection, acting only when compelled—like crossing a river in winter, guarding without loss.\nAs if fearing four neighbors, this is what the *Book of Changes* [Yì] means by *\"With this, one purifies and restrains.\"* [yǐ cǐ zhī jièjiè]\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* [Shūyì] states:\nTo plan before an event is called *cautious* [yù], hence *cautious* means to plan rest before action.\nTo plan after an event is called *hesitant* [yóu], hence *hesitant* means to consider doubt after completion.\nThe ancient ones who embodied the Dao took inner cultivation as their duty, not outer penetration as their ultimate goal.\nThey found forgetfulness of things as good, not delight in mastering things.\nIn constant fear and reflection, they dared not indulge—\nbefore an event’s arrival, they responded only when moved, acted only when pressed, rising only when compelled.\nThus, they planned before events, like crossing a river in winter.\n\nFor matters already accomplished, one stands in solemn warning—\nvision becomes still, action becomes slow,\nplanning comes after the deed,\nas though fearing one’s neighbors.\n\nFor the river is where danger lies,\nand crossing in winter is what people dread—\nif one crosses in winter, how could it be otherwise?\nNeighbors are those who stand close and care for one another,\nensuring mutual protection—\nif one fears one’s neighbors, how could one lose oneself?\n\nYet then, is there anything that can be easily attained?\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"When the gentleman is about to act or move,\nhe must first purify and refine his virtue/power to manifest its clarity.\"*\n\nThis is what it means.\n\n**Solemn as in reverence,**\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*The Analects* says: *\"Gazing upon him, he appears solemn.\"*\n*The Records* says: *\"Solemn, as though in thought.\"*\nZhuangzi says: *\"Things have no inherent Dao—\nrectify one’s bearing to awaken them,\nso that people’s intentions dissolve.\"*\n\nThe fully virtuous/powerful one—\nfrom afar, he inspires awe;\nup close, he does not weary.\nThus his demeanor is upright yet unassuming.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states:\nWhen entering and distinguishing among things,\none risks entanglement in limbs and bones,\nand the body becomes something to be trodden upon.\nWhen exiting and interacting with things,\none manifests in movement and stillness,\nand one’s bearing and posture become observable.\n**Solemn as in reverence**—\nthis is the moment of exiting to interact with things,\nwhen bearing and posture are fit to be observed.\n*The Analects’* *\"Gazing upon him, he appears solemn,\"*\nand *The Records’* *\"Solemn, as though in thought\"*\nboth convey this meaning.\n\nZhuangzi says: *\"Things have no inherent Dao—\nrectify one’s bearing to awaken them,\nso that people’s intentions dissolve.\"*\nIndeed, the fully virtuous/powerful one’s appearance is utterly simple and empty,\nstanding beside others and transforming them—\nwhat more, when seen in gestures and expressions?\nAdjusting his garments and dignifying his gaze,\nfrom afar, he inspires awe—\nfor others, this means no ill intent;\nup close, he does not weary—\nfor himself, this means no exhaustion.\nThus his power to transform others is effortless.\nThe ancient *True Persons* were upright yet unassuming—\nhow could they ever slouch and fawn to invite humiliation?\n\n**Dissolving like ice about to thaw,**\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*\"Water congeals to form ice, ice melts back to water—\nin essence, they are one.\"*\n\nThose ensnared by one-sidedness\nare like water congealing;\nthose attuned to the Great Unity\nare like ice thawing.\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"Dissolving—separation.\"*\nTo abandon things and people without attachment—\nthis is what it means to dissolve.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states:\nWater, though clear, freezes into unclean ice;\nthe spirit, though luminous, solidifies into an opaque form.\nYin congeals to form ice—\njust as the spirit manifests as form.\nYang melts to become water—\njust as form returns to the spirit.\nWater and ice are one in essence.\n\nThose ensnared by one-sidedness\nknow only to guard the form and not to exhaust the spirit,\nthus like water congealing—\nborn from water yet obstructing its flow.\nThose attuned to the Great Unity\nknow to forget the form and merge with the spirit,\nthus like ice thawing—\nspreading freely without hindrance.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* pairs wind over water as *\"Dissolving\"* in *Hexagram Variations*,\nyet in *Appended Commentary* it says *\"Dissolving—separation.\"*\nThus *\"Dissolving\"* in meaning\nrefers to abandoning things and people without attachment.\nOnly by abandoning things and people\ndoes one dissolve like ice thawing—\nwho then would have attachments?\nCompared to the frozen, rigid ice,\nthe difference is vast.\n\n*The Great Origin* says: *\"Without attachments—this is the Sage.\"*\n**Dissolving like ice about to thaw**—\nis this not the way to enter Sagehood?\n\n**Thick as in sincerity, like uncarved wood,**\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*\"Thick\" is the utmost of depth.\nNature is originally profound,\nlike wood before it is shaped into vessels.*\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states:\nThe *Book of Changes* speaks of *\"thick virtue\"*—\nvirtue as the utmost depth;\n*The Records* speaks of *\"thick teaching\"*—\nteaching as the utmost depth.\nThus *\"thick\"* is the utmost of depth.\n\nOnly when people’s lives are profound\ndoes their nature remain profound.\nYet when they shift with circumstances,\nthe profound becomes shallow.\nOnly the virtuous scholar\nrestores the original nature,\ndoes not shift with things,\nand thus is like uncarved wood—\nuncarved yet encircled with visible grain,\nnot yet shaped into a vessel,\nits depth truly profound.\nCompared to hewing it with an axe,\nsplitting its wholeness,\ncarving it into sacrificial vessels,\nand painting it with green and yellow—\nthe difference is vast.\n\n**Vast as in emptiness, like a valley,**\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*\"Vast\" is the extreme of breadth.\nThe heart originally has no bounds,\nlike a valley’s emptiness—\nreceiving and responding without limit.*\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states:\n*The Odes* speaks of *\"vast wilderness\"*—\nreferring to land’s utmost breadth;\n*The Commentary* speaks of *\"vast days\"*—\nreferring to time’s utmost breadth.\nThus *\"vast\"* is the extreme of breadth.\n\nWhen the inch of the heart aligns with the boundless void,\nthe heart originally has no limits.\nWithout boundaries yet not confined,\nits chamber remains ever empty.\nOnly the virtuous scholar,\nat the peak of emptiness,\nexhausts the truth of the heart,\nlike a valley’s ability to receive—\nreceiving without accumulation,\nlike a valley’s ability to respond—\nresponding without attachment.\nIts breadth is truly profound.\nCompared to the six orifices clashing,\nnarrowing one’s dwelling,\nand obstructing the Dao with solidity—\nthe difference is vast.\n\n**Undifferentiated as in turbidity.**\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*\"Not carved nor polished to achieve harmony,\nnot exaggerated to stand out—\nundifferentiated, yet complete, like turbidity.\"*\n\nThis differs from those who refine themselves to reveal impurity.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states:\nThe Perfect One’s way in the world\nis to blend light with dust,\nto rectify angles and round them,\nto be greatly modest without resentment,\nto act without rigid rules—\nnever carving nor polishing to achieve harmony.\nNot seeking distinction,\nthey follow the common—\nnever exaggerating to stand out.\nMoving with danger yet yielding,\nadapting to things with flexibility,\nnot erecting rigid corners,\nundifferentiated, yet complete.\n\nWhile others are bright and clear,\nI alone appear muddled—\nseeming turbid yet not turbid.\nThis differs from those who refine themselves to reveal impurity.\n\nWho could make turbidity still to let clarity arise gradually?\nWho could make stillness move to let life unfold slowly?\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states:\nThe Daoist adept moves yet remains still,\nranging freely yet returning to their roots,\nestablished yet able to respond,\nboundless yet fulfilling all demands.\nThus, when stillness lets clarity arise gradually, nothing can muddy them;\nwhen movement lets life unfold slowly, nothing can unsettle them.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Come slowly, slowly.\"*\nSlowly means to proceed with ease and self-adjustment.\n\nThe Perfect One’s use of mind\nis not to prize stillness as an end in itself,\nnor to labor over life’s emergence as a feat.\nFollowing its natural course,\nthey entrust it to unfold naturally,\nwithout haste or coercion—\nthus clarity arises gradually.\nWhen stillness lets clarity arise gradually,\nten thousand things cannot perturb their mind—\nwho could muddy them?\nWhen movement lets life unfold slowly,\nten thousand things cannot ensnare their thoughts—\nwho could unsettle them?\n\nIf stillness implies cessation,\nbeing bound by things, then it is cessation—\nhow could one respond to things without harm?\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states:\n*\"Self-soothing, like winter crossing a river,\nutterly undifferentiated, as if turbid—\nthis is how one embodies the Dao in the world.*\nOnly by embodying the Dao\ndoes one move and remain still at the right times,\nunburdened by things—\nthus guarding stillness as a vessel.\n\nResponding to things through movement,\none moves yet remains still,\nranging freely yet returning to their roots—\nnot lost in movement,\nso movement does not scatter them—\nwho could muddy them?\nThey are established.\nResponding and thus communicating,\nestablished yet able to respond,\nboundless yet fulfilling all demands—\nnot clinging to stillness,\nso cessation does not obstruct them—\nwho could unsettle them?\n\nThat things cannot muddy them\nis because stillness lets clarity arise gradually.\nThat things cannot unsettle them\nis because movement lets life unfold slowly.\n\nStillness letting clarity arise gradually\nis not to prize stillness as an end in itself,\nnor to labor over life’s emergence as a feat.\nThough overflowing, they do not lose their overflow,\nswept along yet ever self-same—\nhow could ten thousand things perturb their mind?\nMovement letting life unfold slowly\nis not to labor over life’s emergence as a feat,\nnor to force its emergence.\nNot confined to one corner,\nthey emerge in due time to respond—\nhow could ten thousand things ensnare their thoughts?\n\nTruly, *slowly* means to proceed with ease and self-adjustment,\nin accord with the *Classic of Changes*’ *\"Come slowly, slowly.\"*\nEach movement and stillness,\nfollowing its natural course,\nnot contrary to principle,\nentrusted to unfold naturally,\nnot contrary to nature—\nall proceed with ease and self-adjustment.\nWho then has cause for haste or labor?\n\nIf stillness implies cessation,\nacting yet not ceasing is extreme,\nceasing yet not acting is also extreme.\nActing and ceasing in due measure,\nnot bound by things—\nwho could harm them?\nFor if bound by things, then it is cessation—\nhow could one respond to things without harm?\n\nThose who preserve the Dao do not seek fullness.\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states:\n*\"There is accumulation, so there is insufficiency.\nThere is no hoarding, so there is abundance.\"*\nThe Perfect One has no accumulation—\nonly emptiness.\n\nTo preserve the Dao while claiming all the world’s beauty as one’s own\nis already small-minded—\nthus they do not seek fullness.\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Great whiteness seems like shame,\nvast virtue seems insufficient.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states:\n*\"Store grain in a granary—\nwhen the grain is gone, the granary is empty.\nStore water in a vessel—\nwhen the water is gone, the vessel is empty.\nGrass gathers things—\ntake from it as you will, yet it remains.\nPraises gather things—\nyet they sometimes run dry.\nBecause there is accumulation, there is insufficiency.\nThe Perfect One, boundless yet fulfilling all demands,\nutterly empty yet responding to all reality—\nbecause there is no hoarding, there is abundance.\nThe Dao flows without accumulation;\nits use may not be full—\nthe Perfect One preserves the Dao without accumulation,\nonly emptiness.\n\nIf one claims all the world’s beauty as one’s own,\nit is like monopolizing a ravine to be self-sufficient—\nalso small-minded.\nWhen autumn waters arrive, the River Spirit rejoices,\nyet is laughed at by those of great vision.\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Great whiteness seems like shame,\nvast virtue seems insufficient.\"*\nHow could there be the burden of excess?\n\nOnly the unfull can renew without ceasing,\ncan complete without failing.\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states:\n*\"There is accumulation, so there is decay.\nThere is completion, so there is ruin.\nNew and decay alternate, like the four seasons;\ncompletion and ruin follow, like all things.\nFrom the Dao descending to forms and numbers,\nnone escape this.\nOnly the Dao has no form—\nempty yet not full—\nthus it can decay and renew,\ncomplete and ruin,\ntranscending forms and numbers,\nyet never decaying, never ruined.\nThus it is said:\nOnly the unfull can renew without ceasing,\ncan complete without failing.\n\nWood begins flourishing yet ends withered,\nfire first shines yet finally extinguishes—\nbecause there is renewal, decay follows.\nThe sun reaches its zenith and declines,\nthe moon is full and then wanes—\nbecause there is completion, ruin follows.\nThe Daoist adept differs from this.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states:\n*\"Form brings renewal and decay,\nnumbers bring completion and ruin.\nSpring precedes summer, waxing then waning—\nthe cycle of the four seasons follows this.\nSpeech and action alternate, flourishing then declining—\nall affairs follow this.\nThese all fall within the realm of forms and numbers,\nso when new, decay follows;\nwhen complete, ruin comes—\nnone can escape it.\nOnly the Dao has no form,\nunbound by shape—\nthus it can renew and decay yet never decay,\nunbound by numbers—\nthus it can complete and ruin yet never ruin,\nbecause it is empty yet not full.\n\nNow, wood as a thing\nflourishes in spring yet falls in winter—\nthus it begins flourishing and ends withered.\nFire as a thing,\nthe more it is used, the brighter it burns,\nyet when extinguished, it is gone—\nthus it first shines and finally extinguishes.\nRising at dawn, setting at dusk—\nthough it is the essence of yang,\nit cannot escape midday decline.\"*\n\nThe fullness of three and five wanes,\nthe emptiness of three and five returns—\nthough the moon is the essence of yin,\nit cannot escape the fate of fullness leading to deficiency.\n\nAll that is confined to forms and numbers\nthus has newness followed by decay,\ncompletion followed by ruin—\nthis is why it must be so.\nThe Daoist attains emptiness yet never overflows,\ntranscending forms and numbers—\nthus they can decay and renew yet never truly decay,\ncan complete and ruin yet never truly ruin,\nbecause they are empty yet never depleted.\n\nTo attain emptiness to its utmost,\nand to uphold tranquility with resolve—\n*Emperor Huizong’s annotation*: Nothing is more precious than emptiness,\nnothing more excellent than tranquility;\nemptiness and tranquility are the root of all things.\nEmpty, they suffice to embrace all substance;\ntranquil, they suffice to respond to all movement.\nUtmost is where all gather and reach their limit;\nresolve is where effort is fully exerted to its end.\nTo govern emptiness while seeking its limit,\nand to uphold tranquility until resolve is achieved—\nthen though myriad appearances are varied,\nmy mind remains ever clear,\nand though myriad transformations differ,\nmy mind remains ever still.\nThis is called *Heaven’s Music*—\nonly those who embody the Dao can partake in it.\n\n*Explanatory commentary*: When one attains emptiness,\nemptiness becomes vast—\nvast, they can encompass all without omission,\nthus *Liezi* says, \"Nothing is more precious than emptiness.\"\nWhen emptiness is attained,\ntranquility follows—\ntranquility brings clarity—\nclarity allows them to illuminate all without exclusion,\nthus *Liezi* says, \"Nothing is more excellent than tranquility.\"\nTo be without obstruction is emptiness—\nand nothing in the world escapes emptiness.\nTo remain unchanging in singularity is tranquility—\nand nothing in the world’s movement departs from tranquility.\nThis is why *Zhuangzi* speaks of emptiness and tranquility\nas the root of all things.\nThe *Classic* says: \"O profound! Like the source of all things\"—\nit is no different from this.\n\nFor all things are hindered by form,\nconstrained by number—\nbound by form, they become a burden of form;\nbound by number, they become enslaved by number.\nOnly those who transcend form and depart from number\ncan achieve this—\nis it not emptiness and tranquility?\n\nEmpty, they suffice to embrace all substance;\ntranquil, they suffice to respond to all movement—\nbecause they do not hinder form,\nnor constrain by number.\n\nYet to explore the origin of emptiness and tranquility,\nthough naturally attained,\nto achieve their fullness requires diligent governance and steadfastness.\nWhen emptiness is attained to its limit,\nand tranquility upheld with resolve—\nthen stillness and emptiness find their true dwelling.\nLimit is like the apex of a house—\nwhere all gather and reach their end.\nResolve is like a horse straining its utmost—\na thousand miles can be traversed,\nfor it is where effort is fully exerted to its end.\n\nTo attain emptiness to its limit\nmeans to purge all external desires,\nso not even a flaw is seen—\nnot only does nothing begin to exist,\nbut even the *non-beginning* of existence is transcended;\nthis is attaining emptiness to its limit.\n\nTo uphold tranquility with resolve\nmeans to remain ever serenely still,\nnever disturbed—\nnot only to depart from movement and attain stillness,\nbut to be still even amid movement;\nthis is achieving resolve in tranquility.\n\nWhen emptiness is attained to its limit without obstruction by substance,\nand tranquility upheld with resolve without deviation by movement—\nthen though myriad appearances are varied,\nmy mind remains ever clear,\nand though myriad transformations differ,\nmy mind remains ever still.\n\nThe myriad things, each with its own nature and artifice,\nare called myriad appearances.\nThe restless threads of change,\nunending and irregular,\nare called myriad transformations.\nThough myriad appearances vary,\nthe mind remains ever clear—\nbecause emptiness suffices to contain them all.\n*Clear* shares the same root as *mind’s clarity*—\nthe penetration of wisdom.\n\nThough myriad transformations differ,\nthe mind remains ever still—\nbecause tranquility suffices to respond to them.\n*Still* shares the same root as *serene immobility*.\n\nTo attain emptiness and uphold tranquility,\nfully achieving this,\nis the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth,\nthe perfection of Dao and virtue—\nthis is the *Great Root, Great Source*,\nharmonizing with Heaven.\nWhat greater *Heaven’s Music* is there?\n\nObserving *Zhuang Zhou’s* discourse on emptiness and tranquility,\nhe says, \"A single mind steadfast, and the world is ruled,\"\nand, \"A single mind steadfast, and all things submit.\"\nIt is only by steadfastness that one can respond—\nthis is called *ever-clear, ever-still*,\nthe state of a single mind steadfast.\n\nOnly when the mind is steadfast can emptiness and tranquility\nbe extended to Heaven and Earth,\npervading all things—\nhow boundless is the joy?\n\nWhen all things arise together,\nI observe their return.\n*Emperor Huizong’s annotation*: The transformations of all things\nare at the end of the Dao;\nthose who embody the Dao dwell above all things.\nTheir birth springs from a germ—\ntheir end returns to a destination.\nWhen they surge forth along the path of movement,\nI observe that the moving must eventually still,\nand that the emerging must inevitably return—\nthus I perceive the mind of Heaven and Earth,\nremaining amidst all things yet not changing with them;\nthis is called observing their return.\n\n*Explanatory commentary*: When *qi* transforms, form arises;\nwhen form transforms, life emerges—\nbelow the Dao, there is no movement without change.\nThus the transformations of all things\nare at the end of the Dao.\nThe Sage embodies the Dao,\nstanding above all things,\nunifying their principles and governing them—\nthis is why they dwell above all things.\nMoreover, the birth of all things\nis constrained by *creation and transformation*,\nfollowing sequence and order,\nbridging and guiding one another—\nemerging from *mechanism* and flowing in form,\nthen life has its origin in a germ,\nentering *mechanism* and returning to essence,\nthen its end finds its destination.\nIf one lacks true sovereignty and does not grasp its manifestation,\nwhen all things surge forth together,\nthey proceed along the path of *Kàn* (restraint),\nreaching the vast thoroughfare of *Zhèn* (thunder),\nsprouting and emerging,\ngerminating and becoming clear—\ntheir myriad forms displayed,\nrushing toward the path of movement.\nThe Sage comprehends the principles of all things,\nwithin the midst of emptiness and tranquility,\ngradually observing them broadly—\nknowing that all things, though active,\noriginate from *non-action* and grow,\nthough moving, never depart from stillness,\nthough emerging, never truly fail to return.\nObserving that the moving must eventually still,\nand that the emerging must inevitably return—\nthus I perceive the mind of Heaven and Earth.\nIn the *Yì* *Classic’s* *Fù* (Return) hexagram, it says:\n\"Return—\ndoes it not reveal the mind of Heaven and Earth?\"\n\nThe *Return* is indeed the moment when the small and subtle distinctions of things first emerge.\nWhen distinctions emerge,\nit is the state of utter stillness before any disturbance begins,\nand nothing can exceed or evade it.\n\nThe Sage has no fixed mind,\nbut returns to the fundamental Dao of Heaven and Earth.\nThough the world seems chaotic, it is sealed within harmony;\nthough it appears turbulent, it remains at peace.\nIn interacting with things yet not transforming with them,\nit is not that one avoids interaction to attain distinction,\nbut rather that one distinguishes while interacting.\n\nThus, when all things arise together,\none observes their *Return*.\nThough Laozi speaks of the *Return* as the \"arising together,\"\nit is because there is a cessation of arising.\n\nThe principles may differ,\nbut their path to insightful observation is one and the same.\n\nThings are myriad and varied,\neach returning to its root.\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"Myriad and varied\"* refers to the forms of movement and emergence.\nAll things emerge from *Zhèn* (Thunder),\nmeet in *Lǐ* (Fire),\nand thus arise together in myriad forms—\ntheir radiant essence unfurling outward.\nThey delight in *Duì* (Joy),\ntoil in *Kǎn* (Abyss),\nand then discard their brilliance for substance,\nreturning to their innate nature and dwelling.\n\n*Life* is the root of *nature*,\nand *nature* is the root of *fate*.\n*Essence* is the mother of *spirit*,\nand *spirit* is its child.\nWhen essence is complete, spirit reigns supreme;\nwhen nature is perfected, one attains fate.\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* says:\n*\"Things arise like the myriad grasses,*\nslowly moving and emerging—\nthis is the image of myriad forms.\nYet the movement and emergence of things\neach follow their own time.\nObserving the cycles of the four seasons,\nand the subtle transformations of the eight trigrams,\nall things emerge with them yet do not refuse,\nand all things return with them yet do not linger.\nThus, from spring to summer,\nit is Heaven’s emergence and humanity’s reception;\nfrom autumn to winter,\nit is humanity’s return and Heaven’s acceptance.\n\nSpeaking of their emergence and humanity’s reception,\nthey arise from *Zhèn* (Thunder),\nwhich governs the east and corresponds to spring—\nwhen all things germinate and move.\nThey meet in *Lǐ* (Fire),\nwhich governs the south and corresponds to summer—\nwhen all things flourish and bloom,\nthus the myriad forms arise together,\nand their radiant essence unfurls outward.\n\nSpeaking of their return and Heaven’s acceptance,\nthey delight in *Duì* (Joy),\nwhich governs the west and corresponds to autumn—\nwhen all things reach their withered and gathered state;\nthey toil in *Kǎn* (Abyss),\nwhich governs the north and corresponds to winter—\nwhen all things return to their roots,\nthus discarding brilliance for substance,\nand returning to their innate nature and dwelling.\n\nWhen myriad forms arise together,\nit is the spring qi emerging and all grasses sprouting.\nWhen their radiant essence unfurls outward,\nthen they grow and flourish.\nWhen they discard brilliance for substance,\nthen autumn arrives and all treasures mature.\nWhen they return to their innate dwelling,\nthen they vanish into the void of nothingness.\n\nThe *Yì Classic* says:\n*\"Each attains its own nature and fate,*\npreserving the Great Harmony.\"\n\nThose who cast the Great Pivot and congeal form\nhave already uniformly received nature and fate.\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"Spirit arises from the Dao,*\nand form originates from essence.\"\nThose who scatter and focus essence,\nconceiving the vital qi,\nhave already harmonized spirit and nature.\n\nYet Heaven bestows upon me this *fate*,\nand this *fate* within me is called *nature*.\nTo follow one’s fate,\none must first perfect one’s nature—\nfor *fate* is the root of *nature*,\nand *nature* is the root of *fate*.\n\nHumanity’s possession of life\nbegins with essence and follows with spirit.\nTo preserve one’s essence,\none must gather one’s spirit—\nfor *essence* is the mother of *spirit*,\nand *spirit* is its child.\n\nOnly when one knows that nature attains fate,\ncan one return to the fundamental root,\npreserving life without harming nature;\nonly when one gathers spirit through essence,\ncan one grasp the mother and know the child,\nguarding it without loss.\n\nWhen it is said that *essence complete, spirit reigns supreme*,\nis it not through gathering spirit through essence?\nWhen it is said that *perfecting nature attains fate*,\nis it not through knowing nature attains fate?\n\nZhuangzi expounds on the Dao of pure simplicity,\nbeginning with the unity of essence and ending with\n*\"no depletion of spirit\"*—\nthus the perfection of essence and the supremacy of spirit are clear.\n\nMencius discusses the path of *exhausting the heart*,\nbeginning with *\"nurturing nature to serve Heaven\"*\nand ending with *\"cultivating the body to establish fate\"*—\nthus perfecting nature to attain fate is clear.\n\nTo grasp this truth,\none need only observe the *Return* as a secondary matter\nin comprehending the principles of all things.\n\nReturning to the root is called *stillness*,\nand *stillness* is the *Return* to fate.\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"Retaining movement to generate things,*\nthings generated manifest their principles—\nthis is called *form*.\n*Form* preserves spirit,\neach having its own measure—\nthis is called *nature*.\nBefore *form* emerges, there is division,\nyet it arises naturally without pause—\nthis is called *fate*.\n*Fate* spans antiquity to the present and remains constant,\n*nature* changes through myriad forms yet does not alter,\nand preserving the life of form—\nthe person who abandons knowledge and clings to the natural—\nreturns to tranquil repose.\nThings cannot sway them.\"\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* says:\n*\"The realm retains movement to generate form,*\ndisplaying true images of appearance and sound,\nwho does not receive the natural principles of things?\nZhuangzi calls this *form*—\nthe text speaks of the form of things as such.\n\nThe realm transforms to preserve spirit,\nwith flourishing, resounding, and complete vitality—\nall enticed upward, who does not possess their inherent measures?\nZhuangzi calls this *nature*—\nthe *Book of Odes* says, *'Things have form and measure'*—\nas such.\n\nLife brings forth nature,\nand nature brings forth form.\nBefore form emerges,\nthough there is division,\nit arises naturally without pause—\nthis is what is called *fate*.\n\nLife is called *nature*,\n*nature* is received from *fate*,\n*fate* endures without limit,\nnot bound by beginning or end,\nnor constrained by time or measure—\nit spans antiquity to the present and remains constant.\n\n*Nature* accompanies life,\nneither elevated nor diminished by noble or low,\nneither increased nor lost by life or death—\nit changes through myriad forms yet does not alter.\n\nOnly those who preserve the life of form\nremain whole without decay,\nembracing life without harm,\nabandoning knowledge and clinging to the natural,\nfollowing Heaven’s principles,\nreturning to tranquil repose—\nthen things cannot sway them.\"\n\nAbandon wisdom and old ways—\nas when one is said to know nothing, rely on no cleverness.\n\nReturn to stillness and repose—\nas when one is said to be motionless and tranquil, steadfast in great constancy.\n\nOnly thus does one know that *fate* abides within and does not transform with things.\nLike spring turning to summer,\nthen autumn, then winter—\nthe active becomes still,\nthe creative rests,\nand one knows where to cease.\n\nSpring speaks of Heaven’s creation of things,\nautumn of human completion,\nsummer of human caution,\nwinter of Heaven’s return.\nFrom spring to summer,\nHeaven’s essence descends to humanity;\nfrom autumn to winter,\nhumanity returns to Heaven’s way.\n\nSpring and summer precede,\nautumn and winter follow—\ngathering the scattered into unity,\nstripping away the superficial to reveal the substance,\nso that all flowing forms\nreturn to their roots, unaware.\n\nWhen *nature* is refined, it returns to *virtue*,\nand *virtue* attains harmony with its origin—\nthus it is.\n\nIf so, then one embodies *nature* and embraces *spirit*,\nexamining within to restore *fate*’s constancy—\nwhat more could one desire?\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Do nothing to return to simplicity,\nembody nature and embrace spirit.\"*\n\nTo do nothing and return to simplicity\nis to guard purity and naturalness,\nthus one can embody *nature* and embrace *spirit*.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Thickly restore without regret,\nexamine within.\"*\n\nTo follow *nature* and deepen it\nis to need nothing from without,\nthus one can examine within.\n\nOnly thus does one remain serene and do nothing,\nact in accordance with Heaven’s movement—\nwhat hindrance is there to restoring *fate*?\n\nThe *Scripture of Mixed Creation* states:\n*\"Silent and vast,\nindependent yet unchanging.\nEnding with ‘passing’ it calls ‘far’,\n‘far’ it calls ‘return.’\"*\n\nIt is to return to stillness and repose\nthat one may restore *fate*’s constancy.\n\nThus it is first said: *\"Return to the root,\"*\nthen: *\"Restore fate.\"*\n\n*Fate* restored is constancy.\nThe Huizong annotation says:\n*\"Constancy is the opposite of change.\"*\n\nTo restore *fate* is to be unmoved by myriad changes,\nuninterrupted and ceaseless,\none with the Dao,\ngrasping Heaven and Earth,\ninheriting the *qi*-mother.\n\nThe *Explication* says:\n*\"Observing the warp and weft of constancy and change,\nthe warp has a fixed form, hence it is constancy;\nthe weft intertwines and moves, hence it is change.\nConstancy and change are like warp and weft—\nthus constancy is the opposite of change.\"*\n\nYet what is constant in things is exhausted by constancy,\nwhile what is constant in the Dao is sustained by change.\nWhat is constant in things is worn out by constancy,\nwhat is constant in the Dao endures through change.\n\nOnly by restoring *fate* does one return to origin and root,\nenduring from antiquity—\nneither the wave’s turbulence nor the depths’ stillness is inherently good or bad.\nThough traversing countless changes beyond measure,\nits true constancy remains unshaken—\nthis is what is meant by *\"myriad changes cannot sway it.\"*\n\nIf so, then its *spirit* is unobstructed—\nhow could things enter it?\nThis is called *\"no interval.\"*\n\nIt does not shift with time’s passage,\nyet never ceases—\nthis is called *\"no rest.\"*\n\nWithout interval or rest,\none with the Dao,\nit spans antiquity to the present,\nindependent and unchanging,\nas the Xīwéi lineage grasped Heaven and Earth,\nenduring eternally,\nas Fuxi inherited the *qi*-mother,\nboundless in duration.\n\nIts constancy cannot be surpassed.\n\nTo know constancy is clarity.\nThe Huizong annotation says:\n*\"Knowing the Dao’s constancy,\nunmoved by things,\nthe six orifices act in harmony,\nsufficient to mirror Heaven and Earth,\nsufficient to illuminate all things.\"*\n\nThe *Explication* says:\n*\"Unchanging unity is the utmost stillness.\nThe Dao’s constancy does not shift with things—\nthis is achieved through stillness alone.\nOnly stillness prevents it from rushing with movement.\nAmidst the flourishing of all things,\none observes their return;\namongst their teeming forms,\none knows their roots.\nObserving return and roots,\nits stillness cannot be overturned by anything.\"*\n\nThus the six orifices act in harmony,\nsufficient to mirror Heaven and Earth,\nsufficient to illuminate all things.\nThe *orifices* are unobstructed by things—\nthe eye, unclouded by color, sees clearly and is bright;\nthe ear, unobstructed by sound, hears distinctly and is keen;\nthe nose, unobstructed by scent, perceives fragrance as *tian*;\nthe mouth, unobstructed by taste, finds sweetness;\nthe mind, unobstructed by thought, attains knowledge;\nknowledge, unobstructed by things’ principles, attains *virtue*—\nthis is what is called the *\"six orifices acting in harmony.\"*\n\nFrom eye to knowledge,\nthe six act in sequence without obstruction,\nthrough emptiness and unity, through stillness.\n\nEmptiness brings stillness,\nstillness brings clarity,\nclarity lets *spirit* flow freely in all directions,\nreaching extremes without limit.\nAscending to Heaven, descending to Earth,\ntransforming and nurturing all things—\nbeyond representation.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast,\nthey can be observed here;\nthough myriad things abound,\nthey can be shaped here.\n\nStillness is the balance of Heaven and Earth,\nthe illumination of all things—\nonly those who know constancy can attain this.\n\nTo not know constancy is reckless action—\ndisaster.\n\nThe Huizong annotation says:\n*\"The sage knows the Dao’s constancy,\nso actions align with principle,\nalways meeting with good fortune.\nThose who do not know constancy\nfollow things’ shifts,\nentangled in misfortune,\nthus they mistakenly judge good and evil,\ncontradicting the Dao,\nmistakenly generate right and wrong,\ndiverging from the Dao,\nand cannot even preserve their own *fate*—\nhence disaster.\"*\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"To restore is to act without error;\nlost, one does not know to restore.\"*\n\nThis is recklessness.\n\nThe *Explication* says:\n*\"When the heart aligns with the Dao,\naction is without falsehood;\nwhen the heart departs from the Dao,\nmovement is without fail.\nThe sage is the Dao’s fulfillment,\nthus knowing its constancy and not shifting with things.\nActions align with principle,\nno movement is false,\nalways meeting with good fortune,\nno step is taken without examining omens—\nto act with *virtue* and rest the heart is called *rest*,\nto do good and receive a hundred blessings.\"*\n\n「Those who do not know the *constant Dao*,\nact without fail—this is recklessness.\nThe farther one strays from the Dao,\nthe more one conflicts with its manifestations,\nwandering with things and shifting with circumstances,\nthus they say, *\"to battle with the heart\"*—\nstumbling into misfortune, hence their reckless judgment of good and evil.\n\nDrawn by personal likes and dislikes,\nthey fail to recognize that all good and evil arise from a single principle,\nthus they contradict the Dao,\nmistakenly creating distinctions of right and wrong.\nConfused by false praise and blame,\nthey do not know to transform right and wrong through *twofold forgetting*,\nthus they diverge from the Dao.\n\nFor the Dao cannot be separated for even a moment.\nOnce one contradicts it and diverges from it,\nthey exhaust their form and nature,\nravage *yin* and *yang*,\nand cannot even preserve their own *fate*—\nno greater calamity exists, hence disaster.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* in its *\"Sequence of the Hexagrams\"* says:\n*\"To restore is to act without error.\"*\nThis means that when one restores the small and discerns through things,\nit is called *without recklessness*.\n\n*Without recklessness* is the mandate of Heaven,\nto which all things submit.\nThus its *symbol* states:\n*\"When thunder rolls beneath the heavens,\nthings align with *without recklessness*.\"*\n*Without recklessness*, things attain their true nature.\n\nBut when one is lost and cannot restore,\nthey lose their nature and reach its end,\nunable to nurture life—\nthis is recklessness indeed.\n\n**Knowing the constant Dao, one attains *rest*.**\nThe *Explication* says:\n*\"He who knows the Dao’s true constancy\nsees that all things arise from One.\nThus, when observing the world,\nthough myriad and conflicting,\nall are equally the utmost marvel—\nwho can distinguish right and wrong, good and evil?\n\nTo reject what is wrong and uphold what is right\narises from clinging to fixed views;\nto love what is good and hate what is evil\narises from indulging private desires.\nThe perfected sage abandons the burden of fixed views,\nforgets right and wrong,\nand transcends private desires,\nharmonizing good and evil—\nthis is no other than knowing the constant Dao.\n\nTo know the constant Dao is to empty oneself and wander through the world,\nachieving flawlessness.\nRight and wrong, good and evil do not dwell in the heart,\nthus one can embrace all without exclusion.\n\nThe sage’s governance empties the heart—\nthis is how.\n\n**Embracing all is *public*.**\nThe *Explication* says:\n*\"Without a heart of embracing,\none does not solely love one’s own kin,\nnor solely cherish one’s own children—\nwhat private desires remain?\n\nTo perceive things through their forms\nis to indulge private desires;\nto merge with the Dao without heart\nis to attain universal harmony.\nThus the sage governs the world as a family,\nnurtures all people equally,\nand without a heart of embracing,\nloves without limit,\nshowers mercy without bounds—\nwhat private desires remain?\n\nEven Heaven and Earth, when viewed,\ncover all without partiality,\nbear all without discrimination—\nall within the realm of the two cannot escape their embrace.\nThus embracing all is *public*—\nthis is how the sage is seen in Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Being *public* is *royal*.**\nThe *Explication* says:\n*\"The Dao’s practice is universal,\nwhat all people share and follow—\nthis is what the *Records of Rites* cite,\nthe words of Zhongni,\nexplaining why the Dao’s practice is universal,\nand the world rejoices in its embrace without weariness.\n\nThe essence of governance lies in knowing the Dao,\nwhile the sage’s Way serves all hearts.\nThe sage governs the world through the Dao,\nreceives the Dao with the heart—\nthus people are drawn to emulate and return to them,\ntheir sincerity and service flowing naturally,\nenduring forever without ceasing,\nas the world willingly embraces it without restraint.\n\nThis is what the *Classic of Changes* means by:\n*'The people align with what is able.'*\n\n**Royal is Heaven, Heaven is the Dao.**\nThe *Explication* says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth establish their positions,\nthe sage fulfills their abilities—\nwithin the realm, the Four Great Ones,\nthe king stands at their center.\n\nThis is he who unites Heaven, Earth, and people,\nstanding at the center of all—\nthe king.\n\nOne is not separate from the realm of numbers,\nbut the origin of all counts;\nGreat is not separate from form,\nbut the culmination of all bodies.\nLight and clarity reside above,\nbroadly covering and embracing—\nthis is One, great above, without

*exhausting all people aligns with Heaven*?\n\nZhuangzi says:\n*'The king is the Dao of Heaven.'*\nThus, the king is Heaven—\nthis is clear.\n\nHeaven is the great source of the Dao.\nIf one takes Heaven as their origin,\nthey merge with the Dao—\nis this not *embodying Heaven aligns with the Dao*?\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*'Heaven follows the Dao.'*\nThus, Heaven is the Dao—\nthis is clear.\n\nThe *Book of Poetry*’s *\"Great Odes\"* speak of\n*the silent and odorless* yet call it *\"the model and punishment of King Wen\"*—\nKing Wen’s deeds truly aligned with Heaven.\nTo explore Heaven’s Dao,\none must follow the model and punishment of King Wen alone.\n\nThis is *exhausting all people aligns with Heaven*.\n\nAgain, it speaks of\n*the unknowing and unperceiving* yet calls it *\"following the Emperor’s standard\"*—\nthe marvelous Dao’s practice truly aligns with Heaven.\nTo seek the Dao’s marvel,\none must follow the Emperor’s standard alone.\n\nThis is *embodying Heaven aligning with the Dao*.\n\nThe Zhou dynasty’s prosperity\ncame from the sage’s clarity and the people’s reverence,\nguarding the same Dao,\nsung in the *Book of Songs*—\nthis is how the Three Dynasties shone,\nand kings always attain this.\n\n**The Dao is enduring;**\none who follows it does not perish in life.\nThe *Explication* says:\n*\"The Dao endures through ten thousand ages,\nall things attaining it flourish—\nit encompasses all sages without limit,\nspans Heaven and Earth without ceasing—\nthus one who follows it does not perish in life.\n\nPerishing is near to disaster,\nnearness is close to fortune—\nnot perishing means no reckless action leads to disaster,\nand none but those who know the constant Dao can achieve this.\"*」\n\nThe *Explication* states:\n*\"Its blessings extend to ten thousand generations,\noutlasting the ancient past—\nthis is the Dao’s enduring nature,\nand thus it knows no decay across ages.\n\nWhat is meant by ‘gathering

wise,\nsufficiently attuned to the Dao’s constancy,\ncan achieve this.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen of the *Taishang* Section**\n*The Taishang*—\nthe lowly know its existence.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n*\"To govern the world with leniency, one attains tranquility with all under Heaven. Without the joy of striving, praise does not reach him; without the toil of exhaustion, fear of regret does not come. Actions occur without effort, yet they are ever natural—thus the lowly know its existence.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains:\n*\"The world has its inherent nature, and that nature has its inherent virtue. To abide within it is to preserve without perishing—this prevents excess; to yield to it is to release without abandoning—this guards against deviation. If one does not exceed its nature nor alter its virtue, then the world will transform of itself, and one attains serenity with all under Heaven. The Sage governs the world through the Dao, ever ensuring the people have no knowledge, no desire—so that even the wise dare not act. Though people may possess knowledge, there is no use for it; how then could there be the joy of striving or the labor of exhaustion? Without the joy of striving, the heart remains undisturbed, and praise does not reach him; without the labor of exhaustion, the heart remains at ease, and fear of slander does not come. Without desire yet self-sufficient, without action yet naturally settled, effortlessly expansive and harmonious—one attains what one attains without doing, for this is the way of forgetting in the Dao. This is what is meant by ‘the lowly know its existence.’ As Mencius said of the ruler’s people: ‘Their virtue shines like the sun and moon.’ Only at this moment is this true.\n\n*\"Next comes the state of being praised and honored. The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n*\"When benevolence extends to the people and law endures for the ages, all under Heaven love the ruler as a parent—thus he is honored. His renown rises like the sun and moon—thus he is praised. This is the governance of the sage-king, where the traces of praise and honor are manifest, yet the Way of Great Unity is lost.\n\n*\"Zhuangzi said: ‘Shun’s virtue was pure, and the people rejoiced in him.’ The *Odes* speak of the people of King Wen first gathering at Lingtai. The *Cushui* commentary explains:\n*\"Nothing benefits the people more than benevolence. Shun’s virtue of cherishing life permeated the hearts of the people; in the Zhou, governance was refined and benevolence was applied—this is the benevolence extending to the people. Nothing establishes order better than law. Shun established laws for all under Heaven, which could be passed down to future generations; in the Zhou, all affairs were fully attended to—this is the law enduring for the ages. When benevolence extends to the people and law endures for the ages, ruling with such care is like nurturing an infant. All under Heaven love the ruler as a parent—who would not cherish and honor him? When such governance is applied, his fame spreads far and wide, his renown rises like the sun and moon—who would not rejoice and praise him? The rise of the sage-emperor and the completion of the sage-king’s work—his virtue and deeds surpass all under Heaven, beyond concealment. None have not rooted themselves in this, which is why the governance of the sage-king bears the clear traces of praise and honor. Yet if this is so, then the Way of Great Unity is diminished, and there is a question between this and ‘the lowly know its existence.’\n\n*\"Indeed, in Great Unity, the people have no knowledge, no desire—how then could there be praise and honor? In ancient times, Shun’s virtue was pure, and the people of Dengxu came in tens of thousands; King Wen’s spiritual virtue made the people joyful, and the *Odes* of Lingtai marked the beginning of their allegiance. The means by which the sage-king’s governance brings praise and honor is this. Yet the Sage does not truly intend the people’s praise and honor. When great virtue and mighty deeds are bestowed upon the world, praise and honor naturally follow, without expectation.\n\n*\"Next comes the state of being feared and reviled. The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n*\"He governs with laws and unifies with punishments—thus he is feared. If all under Heaven are rewarded, the virtuous are not encouraged; if all under Heaven are punished, the wicked are not deterred. There were lords like the Duke of Chu questioning the weight of the tripod, and ministers like Yang Hu stealing great bows and jade—these are the customs of a declining age, hence he is reviled.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains:\n*\"The Sage governs the world through the Dao, and laws and punishments, rewards and penalties, serve only to assist the Dao in its practice. Laws and punishments clarify the world’s defenses, so the people have something to uphold; rewards and penalties demonstrate the world’s preferences, so the people know what to avoid—all rooted in the Dao. If one relies solely on laws and punishments without the Dao, it may reform outward appearance but cannot transform the heart—thus he is feared, and even reviled.\n\n*\"To govern through virtue is already to govern through laws. To govern through laws is to lack virtue. To unify through ritual is already to unify through punishments. To unify through punishments is to lack ritual. To govern through laws and unify through punishments is to be feared because the people’s hearts are scattered. If all under Heaven are rewarded, the virtuous are not encouraged; if all under Heaven are punished, the wicked are not deterred. There are those like the Duke of Chu and Yang Hu who revile, for they do not know the Dao’s governance of the world. If laws are used to govern and punishments to defend, and if legal measures are clear—so that rewards are given without encouragement and punishments without fear—then encouragement and deterrence are naturally aligned with the Dao. This is not the lesser path of deficiency, but the greater path where the Dao still endures. Thus, trust is insufficient, and distrust arises.\n\n*\"The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n*\"What binds and separates is not done with glue and lacquer; what restrains and loosens is not done with ropes and cords—this is the utmost trust. When the Shang made oaths, the people began to doubt; when the Zhou established assemblies, the people began to doubt—this is because trust was insufficient. When the Sage’s governance is such that ‘the lowly know its existence,’ then actions align without the people knowing it as trust. Next comes the state of being feared and reviled, where cunning, deceit, and scheming arise, and distrust follows.\n\n*\"The *Classic* says: ‘Within it lies trust.’ Thus, trust comes naturally. As Zhuangzi said: ‘What binds and separates is not done with glue and lacquer; what restrains and loosens is not done with ropes and cords’—this is the utmost trust, obtained naturally.\"*\n\n*The Classic of Rites* says: **\"Great trust requires no binding.\"**\nThus, trust is naturally sincere in others, needing no coercion or command.\n\n*The Classic of Rites* also states: *\"When the Shang made oaths, the people began to rebel; when the Zhou established assemblies, the people began to doubt.\"* This is because trust was insufficient, relying on coercion and command.\n\nIndeed, **ultimate trust** arises from what is inherently true—never giving rise to doubt. When trust is insufficient, it loses its essential truth, and thus distrust arises.\n\nIn the **highest governance**, the people, in their natural simplicity, are unaware of its presence, yet their actions align without knowing it as trust. In the next stage, when they are feared and scorned, their customs decay, the pure and genuine disperse, and the vulgar and artful emerge—thus, deceit and scheming arise, and distrust follows.\n\n*The Book of Changes* says: **\"Without words, yet trusted—this lies in virtue and conduct.\"**\nFor when the essence is profound and the heart is in accord, this is called **ultimate trust**. But if one resorts to cunning and deceit, confusing the people with clever arguments and shamelessness, what trust remains? It is because trust was insufficient.\n\n**Ah! How precious are words.**\nThe **Emperor’s commentary** says: *\"When viewed through the Dao, the ruler of the world is upright—how then can words be spoken lightly?\"* One must be cautious and never reckless. Thus, when words are spoken, they become the Dao for the world; when conduct is carried out, they transform the world.\n\nThe **explanatory notes** say: *\"Words are words, but their meaning is not yet fixed.\"* When viewed through the Dao, the speaker has never truly spoken—only the true ruler exists in stillness, thus the world’s ruler is upright. Words are like waves—how then can they be spoken lightly? One must be cautious and never reckless. Words cannot be spoken lightly—that is what ‘Ah! How precious!’ means. Words must not be spoken lightly—that is what ‘precious words’ means.\n\nThe ancients inscribed warnings on golden statues and guarded against blemishes on white jade—thus it is clear that words cannot be spoken lightly. Therefore, the Sage speaks, and the people do not doubt; thus, words become the Dao for the world. When one reveals the truth and acts accordingly, conduct becomes the Dao in itself, transforming the world.\n\nWhy is this so? Because when spoken, it resonates with the law; when acted upon, it aligns with the Way—thus, none under the heavens fail to be sincere. When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled, the people say, *\"This is natural to us.\"* The **Emperor’s commentary** says: *\"The achievements of the Sage are the remnants of the Emperor’s work.\"* To make the people relish their food, admire their clothing, find comfort in their customs, and take joy in their livelihoods—these are the remnants sufficient to fulfill the Emperor’s achievements.\n\nYet they say, *\"This is natural to us,\"* as if the Emperor’s power had no part in it. This is called **the highest governance**.\n\nThe **explanatory notes** say: *\"The Emperor’s work is accomplished without action, yet the world’s affairs are fulfilled—only the traces remain, as if naturally so. This is called the Emperor’s achievements, the Sage’s remnants.\"* When deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled, the heavens are at ease, and the people dwell in peace and tranquility. They have no need to exert their cleverness—only to relish their food, admire their clothing, find comfort in their customs, and take joy in their livelihoods.\n\nFood is taken in moderation, hence relished;\nClothing follows proper adornment, hence admired;\nCustoms are undisturbed, hence comfortable;\nLivelihoods sustain life, hence joyous.\n\nAll these are the remnants of the Sage’s work, sufficient to fulfill the Emperor’s achievements. Thus, the people say, *\"We use it without knowing,\"* and claim, *\"The Emperor’s power has no part in us.\"*\n\nIn ancient times, when **Emperor Yao** governed the world, there was the song of the broad streets: *\"None but the extreme!\"*—this was the **highest governance** of that time.\n\n**End of Volume Four of the Explanatory Notes on the Dao De Jing**\n**Beginning of Volume Five of the Explanatory Notes on the Dao De Jing**\n\n**Explanatory Notes on the Dao De Jing by Jiang Rong, Student of the Imperial Daoist Academy**\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Dao and Virtue/Power in Decline**\n\nWhen the Great Dao declines, there arises **virtue** and **righteousness**;\nThe **Emperor Hui Zong**’s annotation states: *\"When the Dao is lost, then virtue emerges; when virtue is lost, then righteousness arises; when righteousness is lost, then propriety follows. Righteousness establishes others, propriety establishes oneself—yet this is ever farther from the Dao.\"*\n\n**Han Yu** failed to grasp the Sage’s true intent regarding **Dao** and **virtue/power**, instead claiming that **virtue** and **righteousness** are fixed names, while **Dao** and **virtue/power** are mere empty positions. The **Master Lao**’s minor **virtue** and **righteousness** reflect a limited perspective—what **Zhuang Zi** called the *\"veiled and ignorant folk.\"*\n\nThe **Explanatory Notes** clarify: *\"The fullness of the Dao lies hidden in the undifferentiated chaos, while virtue/power is a division of the Dao, manifesting as the interplay of firmness and yielding. Since the Dao cannot be fully attained, its loss gives rise to virtue/power. Since virtue/power cannot be fully realized, its decline spawns righteousness. Righteousness can be cultivated, and when cultivated, it approaches propriety—thus, when righteousness is lost, propriety emerges, making one ever more distant from the Dao. In its essence, the Dao is singular—just as **Yang Zi** said: *‘When unified, it is whole; when divided, it scatters.’* Han Yu, failing to grasp the Sage’s intent, resorted to subjective distortion, positing that **virtue** and **righteousness** are fixed names while **Dao** and **virtue/power** are empty terms. He labeled the **Master Lao**’s minor **righteousness** as a narrow view, yet he did not realize that the **Seven Virtues** are all contained within **Dao** and **virtue/power**. If **Dao** and **virtue/power** do not decline, why would one need the **Seven Virtues**? Examining the root, even if one rejects **virtue** and **righteousness**, they already operate within the realm of **Dao** and **virtue/power**. Could his heart truly believe that **virtue** and **righteousness** are insufficient for governing the world? His minor **virtue** and **righteousness** are merely a means to elevate them—precisely what **Zhuang Zi** called the *‘veiled and ignorant folk.’*\n\nLater generations, obscured by worldly learning, lacked higher insight. Upon hearing the **Master Lao**’s teachings, they either dismissed them as madness or defamed them as crude and shallow. In the final age, scholars spend their lives in vain, only to become **petty Confucianists**—Han Yu’s critique is well-founded.\n\nWhen wisdom and insight emerge, there arises **great deceit**;\nThe **Emperor Hui Zong**’s annotation states: *\"When the people’s wisdom and strength are exhausted, deceit follows.\"*\n\nThe **Explanatory Notes** clarify: *\"In an age of perfect virtue/power, the people act without knowing why, move without knowing where they go. They follow their nature and find contentment; they accept their lot and remain at peace. Ambition and craft are forgotten. What need have the people’s hearts for wisdom and strength? When desire and calculation first arise, external temptations lure them. When wisdom fails, they grow perplexed; when strength fails, they grow sluggish. Losing their natural state, they sink into artificial contrivance—this is when the people’s wisdom and strength are exhausted, and deceit takes over. The Sage, in governing with forbearance, seeks to restore the people to their natural state, yet does not rule through wisdom and strength alone. Thus, **Lie Zi** says: *‘The Sage relies on the Dao’s transformation, not on wisdom and cleverness.’*\n\nWhen familial bonds are fractured, there arises **filial piety and kindness**;\nWhen the state is in chaos, there arise **loyal ministers**.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong annotated: *\"Names arise from insufficiency.\"*\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"A filial son does not flatter his parents; a loyal minister does not fawn upon his lord.\"* This is the peak of the subject’s virtue.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary states: *\"A name is the guest of reality. If reality is present, the name follows naturally. Yet names always arise from insufficiency.\"*\n\nWhen a gentleman achieves renown, nothing surpasses loyalty and filial piety. Serving one’s parents, he does not choose a place to settle—this is filial piety. If he merely agrees with his parents’ words and approves of their deeds to flatter them, this is not true filial piety. Serving his lord, he does not choose a task to undertake—this is loyalty. If he merely agrees with his lord’s words and approves of his deeds to fawn upon him, this is not true loyalty. Only when he neither flatters his parents nor fawns upon his lord does the heart of loyalty and filial piety reach its fullness—this is the peak of the subject’s virtue.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage and Abandoning Wisdom**\n\nDiscard the Sage and abandon wisdom, and the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong annotated: *\"The Dao aligns with nature, unified without mixture. Departing from the Dao to establish virtue is what is called sage-wisdom. When sage-wisdom stands, then the world first sees the conduct of arrogance, obscurity, fierceness, and eccentricity. Shocking the ignorant to reveal the filthy, praising Yao while condemning Jie—then the benefit of sage-wisdom to the world is little, while its harm is great. If one discards and abandons it, aligning with the Dao as one body, then each finds peace in their natural state and life’s essence. Its benefit is vast.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary states: *\"At the origin of reception, nature and the Dao are indistinct. After reception, nature and the Dao diverge. Only when indistinct with the Dao is there no distinction—this is the ‘Dao aligning with nature, unified without mixture.’ Only when diverging from the Dao are there boundaries—this is the ‘departing from the Dao to establish virtue, what is called sage-wisdom.’\"*\n\nAt the origin of nature, the subtle root is complete and whole. Sage and fool alike initially share no distinction. Those who depart from the Dao externally establish their virtue, losing the true and sinking into artifice, lost and never returning. Thus, the ignorant display wisdom, and the name of the Sage arises. When sage-wisdom stands, they cannot follow nature’s spontaneity, and the world first sees the conduct of arrogance, obscurity, fierceness, and eccentricity. Arrogance leads to excess; obscurity plunges into depth; fierceness defies reach; eccentricity stands apart—none are the conduct of simplicity and rectitude. Thus, they adorn wisdom to shock the ignorant, refine themselves to reveal the filthy, praise Yao while condemning Jie, yet they do not know to forget all and transform in the Dao. Then the benefit of sage-wisdom to the world is little, while its harm is great—this aligns with Zhuang Zhou’s words: *\"Do you delight in the Sage? Then you are like the man who admires a withered tree. Do you delight in wisdom? Then you are like the man who admires a blemish.\"*\n\nOnly when one knows to discard and abandon it, aligning with the Dao as one body, does one follow nature’s spontaneity and bring the world to governance through non-action. Only then does one find peace in their natural state and life’s essence. Truly, when the people return to simplicity and find peace in their nature and life, they align with the age and attain tranquility—can their benefit be calculated? Indeed, this is what is meant by *\"its benefit is vast.\"*\n\n**Discard Benevolence and Abandon Righteousness, and the People Return to Filial Piety and Kindness.**\n\nThe Emperor Huizong annotated: *\"Filial piety and kindness are innate nature. To hobble for benevolence, to tiptoe for righteousness—this is to replace nature with benevolence and righteousness. If one discards benevolence and abandons righteousness, the people will return to their nature and restore their origin, not merely loving their own parents, not merely cherishing their own children—what then is filial piety and kindness?\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary states: *\"All conduct stems from filial piety as its root; the three treasures prioritize kindness first. The heart of filial piety and kindness arises from innate nature, not from artificiality or external imposition. As for hobbling for benevolence—conduct is unnatural—and tiptoeing for righteousness—effort is forced—this is to replace nature with benevolence and righteousness. If one discards benevolence and abandons righteousness, the people’s nature will refine and return to virtue, virtue reaching back to its origin—this is returning to nature and restoring the beginning. If so, then the Great Dao is practiced, and the world is held in common: not merely loving one’s own parents, but extending care to all elders; not merely cherishing one’s own children, but nurturing all youth. Loving one another without knowing it as benevolence, uprightness without knowing it as righteousness—then filial piety and kindness belong to all, scarcely knowing why it is so.\"*\n\n**Discard Artifice and Abandon Gain, and Thieves and Robbers Will Cease.**\n\nThe Emperor Huizong annotated: *\"Those who practice cunning artifice have no shame. Those with desires for gain disregard righteousness. These are all of the ‘borrowed’ kind.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary states: *\"Without shame for vice, there is no way to know shame. Without knowing shame, there is no way to practice righteousness. For a person to be human, it is noble to act with shame and to prioritize righteousness when seeing gain. If one understands this, then one will not do what should not be done and will not desire what should not be desired, returning to the path of the gentleman. As for those who practice cunning artifice, their purity is incomplete, and the Dao does not record them—this is having no shame. As for those with desires for gain, they rely on benevolence while stepping on righteousness, counterfeit the true with the false—this is disregarding righteousness. Having no shame and disregarding righteousness, they do what should not be done and desire what should not be desired. Truly, few differ from those who take what is not theirs. This is why they are said to be of the ‘borrowed’ kind.\"*\n\nThese three principles—though insufficient as doctrine—are thus assigned their place.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong annotated: *\"The ancient kings governed the world through humanity. By the Zhou, refinement grew excessive, and by its decline, ornament overran substance, with ornament in excess while substance was insufficient. The world lost its original simplicity and sank into the habits of private desire. Laozi, in the late Zhou, sought to loosen these flaws and restore them to their root. Thus, he discarded benevolence and righteousness, abandoned ritual and learning—even sage-wisdom was to be rejected.\"*\n\nWas his heart truly convinced that the Seven Virtues of sage-wisdom were insufficient to govern the world? The Way of the ancient kings, like the cycle of seasons, returns again. To rely on refinement (*wén*), one must first establish substance (*zhì*), hence their proper place. This is what is meant by \"seeing the unadorned and embracing simplicity, reducing private desires and minimizing wants.\"\n\n**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**\nCold accumulates to become heat—not in a single day. Observing the rhythms of heaven to understand human affairs, we see that the ancient kings governed the world through humanity, progressing from simplicity to fullness, until by the Zhou, refinement grew excessive. At that time, institutions were established for every matter, and intricate regulations were set to guard against excess. Never was refinement more elaborate. Yet when refinement reaches its extreme, it leads to decay—substance is lost. There was too much emphasis on ornament while substance was insufficient, and the world lost its original simplicity, withering into falsehood. It sank into private desires and was obscured by petty wisdom—how could one not address this decay?\n\nLaozi, in the late Zhou, sought to ease these flaws and restore them to their root. His intent lay here. Thus, he discarded the Seven Virtues and returned to the natural state, abandoning ritual and learning to merge in Daoist practice—even sage-wisdom was rejected, no longer held in esteem. He wished the world to value the fundamental over the superficial, to loosen rigid adherence to the past. Was his heart truly convinced that benevolence and sage-wisdom were insufficient to govern the world?\n\nThe Xia emphasized loyalty, the Shang simplicity, and the Zhou refinement—sometimes adapting, sometimes revolutionizing, sometimes diminishing, sometimes adding. The Way of the ancient kings, like the seasons, returns in cycles. Yet when refinement falters, it must be restored by substance, just as summer returns to autumn. To rely on refinement, one must first establish substance—hence their proper place.\n\n**Seeing the Unadorned (*Jiànsù*):**\nEmperor Huizong annotated: *\"The Analects say: 'Painting begins with the blank canvas.' Before receiving color, the blank canvas is pure and unadorned.\"*\n**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**\nPainting begins with the blank canvas, hence the Analects say, *\"Painting begins with the blank canvas.\"* Before receiving color, the blank canvas is white. When color is applied, the original purity is obscured—this is the true nature of things. It is called *sù* because it remains unstained by external influences. To see the unadorned is to be clearly enlightened, without blemish, inwardly complete, and free from deceit—this is purity without admixture. This aligns with Zhuangzi’s *\"clear and entering the unadorned\"* and the idea that *sù* means unmixed.\n\n**Embracing Simplicity (*Bàopǔ*):**\nEmperor Huizong annotated: *\"The Classic says: 'The undifferentiated (*pǔ*) disperses to become things.' If the undifferentiated is not carved, embracing simplicity means stillness and unity without change.\"*\nZhuangzi said: *\"To align with desirelessness is called simplicity.\"* Simplicity restores the people’s true nature.\n\n**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**\nThings derive from simplicity as their root, hence the Classic says, *\"The undifferentiated disperses to become things.\"* If the undifferentiated is not carved, its form remains whole, untouched by artificial refinement. Simplicity is the true nature of things. It is called *pǔ* because it is uncarved, relying only on human artifice. To embrace simplicity is to be sincere and whole, returning to natural spontaneity, tranquil and at ease—this is stillness and unity without change. This aligns with Zhuangzi’s *\"pure and unbroken simplicity.\"* Thus, simplicity is the people’s natural state. Restoring this natural state means desirelessness, self-fulfillment, and aligning with Zhuangzi’s *\"to align with desirelessness is called simplicity.\"* Simplicity restores the people’s true nature.\n\n**Reducing Private Desires and Minimizing Wants (*Shǎosī-guǎyù*):**\nEmperor Huizong annotated: *\"Self-seeking is private; nothing nourishes the heart better than minimizing wants.\"*\nReducing private desires and minimizing wants clarifies the distinction between inner and outer, discerns true from false, preserves virtue whole, and restores true nature—thus the title of sage-wisdom fades.\n\n**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**\nTo be obscured by self-interest is to lose the greater harmony. Self-seeking is private. To be entangled in desires is to drown in agitation. Nothing nourishes the heart better than minimizing wants. Private desires and wants are external distractions, not inner reflections—they cultivate falsehood, not true nature. Only by reducing private desires and minimizing wants can one distinguish inner from outer, know what to value, discern true from false, preserve virtue uncorrupted, and restore true nature. Thus, in non-action and effortless action, the title of sage-wisdom vanishes—who then governs the world?\n\n**Chapter 20: \"Discarding Learning, There Is No Worry\" (*Juéxué-wúyōu*):**\nEmperor Huizong annotated: *\"Learning seeks to exhaust principles. While striving to exhaust principles through learning, how can one avoid worry over right and wrong, success and failure in governance?\"*\nLearning leads to the Dao. When one attains the Dao, learning is discarded—reducing further, reducing until non-action yet nothing remains undone. One follows the natural flow of life and nature, finding joy without end, thus free from worry.\n\n**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**\n*Li* is like a boundary that can be measured; only through learning can one explore its depths. *Dao* is like a path all share; only by discarding learning can one reach its utmost.\n\nLearning seeks to exhaust principles—this is the beginning of learning, hence the Classic says, *\"In learning, there is daily increase.\"* While striving to exhaust principles through learning, one deliberates over right and wrong within the heart, examines governance through past and present—this is not yet free from the burden of thought. How can one avoid worry? Confucius worried about learning not being practiced—this is it.\n\nLearning leads to the Dao—this is the end of learning, hence the Classic says, *\"In the Dao, there is daily reduction.\"* When one attains the Dao and discards learning, limbs are discarded, senses are abandoned, form and knowledge are set aside, and all affairs vanish. Reducing further, reducing until nothing remains—then in non-action, yet nothing is left undone. Thus, motionless yet responsive, one follows the natural flow of life and nature, finding joy in forgetfulness, joy without end—thus free from worry.\n\nConfucius took delight in coarse rice and water, finding joy therein—this is it.\n\nMaster Wenzi said: *\"The heart has no discontent.\"*\n\nWithout discontent yet acting without end, this may be called attaining the Dao.\n\nThus, as the Dao is daily reduced, one finds joy in the Dao here—this is clear.\n\nHow far apart are *\"unique\"* and *\"affirmative\"*?\nHow different are *\"good\"* and *\"evil\"*?\n\nHuizong annotated:\n*\"Unique\" and \"affirmative\"* share the same sound;\n*\"Good\"* and *\"evil\"* stem from one nature.\nThe petty-wise cling to self, separating them into two.\nThe enlightened embrace the whole—\ntheir essence is not truly distinct.\n\nThe Sage governs the world in ancestral temples and courts.\nSpeaking to the great officers, he does not speak uniformly thus—\nsuppressing evil and promoting virtue, fearing it may not be thorough.\nWhat people fear, one cannot fail to fear—this is so.\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\nIf one merges the Dao with things, then distinctions arise from concealment.\nIf one divides things by the Dao, then distinctions arise from establishment.\nSpeaking from human inclination,\n*\"Unique\"* is reverence, *\"affirmative\"* is arrogance.\nGood lies in what is cherished, evil in what is despised—\nthis is inherently different.\n\nYet observing principle,\n*\"Unique\"* and *\"affirmative\"* emerge from one sound,\n*\"Good\"* and *\"evil\"* merge in one nature—\nwhat then distinguishes them?\n\nThe petty-wise, clinging to self, follow their emotions.\nFollowing emotion and self, each plants their own perspective,\narbitrarily drawing boundaries—\nthis is what is meant by *\"separating into two.\"*\n\nThe enlightened embrace principle.\nEmbracing principle to observe,\nthey encompass all particulars,\nunifying them in supreme subtlety—\nthis is what is meant by *\"essence not truly distinct.\"*\n\nThe Sage merges his heart with the Dao,\nseeing no singular thing,\nyet toward the world’s good and evil,\nhe does not remain indifferent—\nfor he does not wish to differ from the world.\n\nThus, when he emerges to govern,\nin ancestral temples and courts,\nhe readily distinguishes governance as his task;\nspeaking to lesser officers, he maintains harmonious discourse;\nspeaking to greater officers, he shows reverent deference.\nThus, he adapts to emotions through ritual,\nand through ritual distinguishes differences—\nhence his speech is not uniform.\n\nIf so, then evil is suppressed, virtue is exalted,\njudging the world’s right and wrong with impartiality,\ndemonstrating the world’s likes and dislikes—\nfearing it may not be thorough,\nhe takes heed of what people fear,\nand cannot fail to fear—\nbowing to align with them.\n\nWhat people fear, one cannot fail to fear.\nHuizong annotated:\n*\"The Dao stirs all things yet does not share the Sage’s worry.*\n*Calamity and fortune breathe with the people—this is governance.*\n*Those who embody the Dao have no worry;*\n*those who engage in affairs have reverence.\"*\n\nWhat people fear, yet failing to take warning,\nfew can avoid exhaustion.\nThus, the virtuous cultivate through awe and reflection.\n\nThe *Classic of Poetry* says: *\"Fear the might of Heaven.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*\"Responding in accord is the Dao.*\n*The Dao requires no thought or deliberation—*\n*it stirs all things yet does not share the Sage’s worry,*\n*this is what is meant by ‘motionless yet responsive.’*\n*Acting in concealment is governance.*\n*Governance involves thought and action—*\n*calamity and fortune breathe with the people,*\n*this is what is meant by ‘responding to the world’s affairs.’*\n*Those who embody the Dao retreat to accompany Heaven,*\n*thus they have no worry;*\n*those who engage in affairs emerge to interact with people,*\n*thus they have reverence.*\n\nWhat people fear, yet failing to take warning,\nfew can avoid exhaustion.\nOnly with solemn vigilance does one achieve reverence,\nand with diligent caution does one attain prudence—\nthen action will surely lead to auspiciousness,\nwithout fear of regret or hesitation.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *\"The virtuous cultivate through awe and reflection.\"*\nThe *Classic of Poetry* says: *\"Fear the might of Heaven.\"*\nThese are the utmost warnings.\n\nIndeed, cultivating through awe and reflection,\nthinking to prevent exhaustion—\nlike Boyi’s vigilance without worry—\nfearing Heaven’s might,\nto preserve the world—\nlike Gaozong’s stern reverence—\nobserving this, one knows\nwhat people fear cannot fail to be feared—\nits principle is clear.\n\nBoundless, its end is without measure.\n\nHuizong annotated:\n*\"The myriad complexities of worldly affairs,*\n*entangled and inexhaustible,*\n*without beginning or end—*\n*this is what is meant by ‘good and evil not yet settled.’*\n*Only the enlightened know they merge as one.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*\"The vastness of the six directions,*\n*the multitude of things,*\n*endless threads of turmoil,*\n*daily pressing forward,*\n*entangled and chaotic,*\n*too vast to respond to—*\n*this is the inexhaustible complexity of worldly affairs.*\n\n*Circulating like a turning wheel,*\n*repeating

what is meant by ‘good and evil not yet settled.’*\n\n*Common folk take good as what is approved,*\n*evil as what is rejected—*\n*thus what they reject is not what they approve,*\n*though there are judgments of approval and rejection,*\n*all originate from the realm of ‘this’ and ‘that.’*\n*How could they know of the vast, mysterious, and unified Dao?*\n\nOnly the enlightened release their intellect,\nturning their light to illuminate Heaven—\nthen what things call ‘that,’\ndoes it truly have a fixed nature?\nWithout fixed nature, then all is ‘that.’\n\nWhat things call ‘this,’\ndoes it truly have a fixed nature?\nWithout fixed nature, then all is ‘this.’\n\nIf things have no ‘this’ or ‘that,’\nthen one knows they merge as one—\nbeauty and ugliness, good and evil,\nwould be simplified yet cannot be—\nwhy then distinguish them so?\n\nThe common crowd rejoices,\nas if feasting on the grand sacrifice,\nas if ascending the spring platform.\n\nHuizong annotated:\n*\"All things flourish with yang, congeal with yin.*\n*Rejoicing is the outward manifestation of flourishing.*\n*The common crowd loses the stillness of nature,*\n*pursuing external affairs—*\n*like delighting in rich flavors to nourish body and mouth,*\n*like gazing upon grandeur to entertain heart and will.*\n*Those lost in pleasure drift ever farther from the Dao.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*\"Yin and yang are the great movements of qi.\"*\n\nThe essence of things lies in their qi—\nwhen yang flourishes, it is vibrant and harmonious,\nfor yang melts and completes itself;\nwhen yin congeals, it is still and tranquil,\nfor yin halts and settles.\n\nSometimes vibrant, sometimes congealed—\nit depends on the season and the thing.\nThus, the flourishing is but the outward display of vitality.\n\nThe common crowd loses the stillness of nature,\ntransforming with things,\npursuing external affairs while neglecting inner observation.\n\nThey delight in rich flavors to nourish body and mouth,\nyet never know the subtlety of simplicity—\nnot merely feasting on the grand sacrifice.\nThey gaze upon grandeur to entertain heart and will,\nyet never perceive the boundless void—\nnot merely ascending the spring platform.\n\nThose lost in pleasure are burdened by things,\nthus drifting ever farther from the Dao.\n\nIf one attains the wondrous observation of singular nature,\nthen all dharmas are complete—\nmovement and stillness merge,\ntrue joy is preserved whole,\nand what distance remains from the Dao?\n\nI alone fear the unmanifested—\nlike an infant before its first stirrings.\n\nHuizong annotated:\n*\"The Classic says: Return to the infant state.*\n*Zhuangzi says: If not yet in infancy, then who begins?*\n*The infant’s thoughts are yet unformed,\nindifference to near and far is equal,\nserene and still—\nharmony accumulates within,\nwhile brilliance does not yet manifest externally,\nthus like an infant before its first

*‘Constant virtue does not depart,’*\nand then: *‘Return to the infant state.’*\nWhen a child reaches toddlerhood, affection already stirs—\nas Zhuangzi says: *‘Born five months, able to speak—\nif not yet in infancy, then who begins?’*\nOnly in infancy, without knowing,\ndoes one reside without purpose,\nwalk without destination,\nthoughts unformed and nothing to ponder,\nindifference to near

following nature naturally,\nwithout artificial adornment,\nlike an infant before its first stirrings.\nFor *‘fear’* means the heart receives nothing.\nWhen the heart receives nothing,\nit is serene and empty of all things,\nembracing the One and guarding the True—\nwhat choice between this and the infant before its first stirrings?\nThe Master Lao established his teaching in the world,\ndesiring the people to return to the infant state—\nthus, in *‘Cultivating qi and attaining softness,’* he says: *‘Can one be like an infant?’*\nAnd in *‘The depth of virtue,’* he says: *‘Compared to the uncarved block.’*\nThough his words differ,\nhis intent is to refine nature and restore virtue—\nwhen virtue reaches its original state, it is One.\n\n*Buying and selling, returning to the origin.*\nHuizong annotated:\n*\"The *Yijing* says: *‘At the proper time, ride the six dragons to govern heaven.’*\n*Buying and selling*—\nfollowing the season and principle without leaning to one side,\nthus appearing to have no destination.\"\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*\"The transformations of all things are chaotic and uneven.\nOnly by adapting to change, without attachment,\ncan one speak of *buying and selling.*\nThe *Yijing* says: *‘At the proper time, ride the six dragons to govern heaven.’*\nThe dragon rides the time—\nspeaking of the *Yi* principle transforming through timely adaptation.\nOnly by adapting to the time,\nfollowing its inherent principle and riding it,\nwhy need one drive?\nThus, *buying and selling* means holding fast without constraint,\nfollowing principle without resistance,\nnaturally aligning with things yet not leaning to one side—\nthus appearing to have no destination.\nThis aligns with *‘All things are threads of the One, none sufficient to

abandoned.\nHuizong annotated:\n*\"Function covers the world,\nyet seems not of oneself.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*\"The Sage, through the Dao, lends to the world,\nnurtures all things yet does not claim righteousness,\nbenefits countless ages yet does not claim benevolence,\ncovers heaven and earth, carves all forms yet does not claim skill—\nnever has he acknowledged his deeds as his own.\n*Zhuangzi’s Inner Chapters* discuss the governance of the enlightened king:\n*‘Function covers the world, yet seems not of oneself,’*\nsaying he *‘plays in the void.’*\nFor the *‘void’* is the mysterious operation of the Dao—\nthe Sage, with ultimate emptiness, responds to all things,\nthus accomplishing the emperor’s function—\nthis is truly incidental.\nHow could he claim it as his own and possess it?\nI, a foolish man, am pure—\n*pure and simple.*\nHuizong annotated:\n*\"Confucius said: *‘When I spoke with Ran You, all day he did not contradict me—\nas if he were simple.’*\n*Pure

as simplicity—\nis this not Ran You?\nObserve his explanation of *‘heart’s fasting’* and the marvel of *‘sitting-forgottenness’*—\nthe Sage, recognizing his profound insight,\nsaid: *‘When I spoke with Ran You, all day he did not contradict me—\nas if he were simple,’*\nmeaning *‘his appearance was simple.’*\"*\n\nThe true nature of the single essence,\nserene and ever-present,\nquiet and effortless yet without the stir of heaven’s mechanism,\nempty and tranquil, silently harmonizing with the Dao—\nthen pure whiteness is fully within,\nand morning clarity reveals its singularity.\nThis is truly great wisdom.\n\nThe *Zhuzi* says:\n*\"He who lacks the dim and hidden intent\nhas no radiant clarity;\nhe who lacks the sluggish and dull affairs\nhas no resplendent achievement.\"*\nIs this what is meant?\n\nYet I, this foolish man’s heart—\n*pure and simple*—\nam I truly foolish?\nNo—it is only that lesser wisdom is discarded\nwhile great wisdom shines forth.\n\nThe common man is radiant,\nwhile I alone seem dim;\nthe common man is keen,\nwhile I alone am muddled.\n\nHuizong annotated:\n*\"If one conforms to the common flow,\nthen radiance is taken for clarity—\nyet its clarity is small.\nKeenness is taken for wisdom—\nyet its wisdom is hollow.\nTo abandon things and people,\nstanding apart from the world’s habits,\nthen one appears as if lost yet exists,\nas if dull yet sharp—\nhow could the vulgar world perceive this?\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*\"To preserve light without revealing it\nis the utmost clarity.\nTo act without contrivance\nis the true wisdom.\nThe emotions of the common masses,\nobscured by shallowness,\nadorn themselves with vulgarity and align with it—\nthus they take radiance for clarity,\nyet their clarity is small,\nnot the ultimate clarity;\nthey take keenness for wisdom,\nyet their wisdom is hollow,\nnot the true wisdom.\n\nThose who embody the Dao differ thus:\nsubtle, mysterious, and profound—\nunfathomable.\nAbandoning things, they bear no burden;\nseparating from people, they are not enticed.\nLoftily detached from the vulgar,\nthey awaken as if lost yet exist—\nas in *‘serene,

annotated:\n*\"Deep and still, nature settled—\nthe complete body of the Dao.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*\"Deep in dwelling, pure in clarity—\ndeep and still, nature settled,\ninner preservation,

stubborn and crude—\nthis is called the use of non-utility.\n*The Classic* says:\n*The heart not conforming to the patterns of virtue and righteousness is crude.*\nAnciently, *‘refined’* was called beautiful,\n*‘uncultivated’* was called crude.\nCrude means not adorned with wisdom,\nuncultivated means not seen as beautiful—\nthe divine person thus is without talent.\"\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*\"The way of governing the world\nconsiders non-utility as the utmost use.\nOsmanthus is edible, so it is cut down.\nLacquer is useful, so it is stripped—\nthese are uses of utility,\nthe breath of the vulgar.\nAll know how to flaunt their wisdom,\nboast their abilities—\nthis is the use of utility,\nyet they do not know how to fragment their virtue—\nthis is the use of non-utility.\nAll people have their purposes—\nthis is the use of utility,\nbecause of their vulgarity.\nI alone am stubborn and crude—\nthis is the use of non-utility,\nbecause of my lack of talent.\n*Crude* is the same as *‘dim crude’*—\n*crude* means without knowledge.\n*Uncultivated* is the same as *‘utterly crude’*—\n*uncultivated* means without refinement.\nThe divine person thus is without talent,\nyet this lack of talent is what makes him the greatest talent—\nthus the use of non-utility is clearly use.\n\nZhuangzi in *The Worldly Realm*\nfirst spoke of the crooked plowshaft,\nthen of the great tree of Shangqiu,\nand finally of osmanthus cut because it is edible,\nlacquer stripped because it is useful—\nclearly showing how the use of non-utility differs from the use of utility.\n\nYet to wander *The Worldly Realm*\nand share in the people’s joys and sorrows—\nhow could one not know this?\n\nI alone differ from others,\nyet seek nourishment from my mother.\n\nHuizong annotated:\n*\"An infant longs for the colt’s following—\nonly the Dao’s seeking remains.\nThe Dao generates, nurtures, grows, and rears—\nall things draw from it.\nIt has the intent of a mother.\nOnly the Dao’s seeking is this,\nso as to differ from those who lose their nature in vulgarity.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*\"The Dao acts through all things,\nlending and completing,\ncovering and nurturing without limit—\nit can be the mother of the world.\nAll that has life and form—\nhow could any depart from the Dao?\nYang Xiong’s *Asking About the Dao* says:\n*‘An infant longs for the colt’s following,’*\nto show that all things seek the Dao’s origin in nature,\nnot by coercion.\nThe Dao, from emptiness and stillness,\ntransforms into the myriad things,\ngenerates them to fulfill their nature,\nnurtures them to perfect their growth,\nlengthens them to completion,\nrears them to fullness—\nall things go to draw from it without depletion,\nhow different from the mother’s embrace?\"*\n\nThe myriad things arise from the Dao, thus the Dao is the mother and the things are her children. The *Classic* states:\n*\"There is the mother of all named things.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"The world has its beginning, which becomes the mother of the world.\"*\nThus, the Dao’s maternal intent is clearly seen.\n\nPeople of the world not only fail to grasp their mother but cannot even preserve her. They abandon the true for the false, and the Dao grows ever more distant. Hence, the ancients spoke of *\"seeking the sea with a spear\"* as their only recourse.\n\nBut those who seek only the Dao—\nhow different are they from those who lose their nature in vulgarity?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Virtue-Power of the Sage’s Container**\nThe virtue-power of the Sage’s container follows only the Dao.\n\n*The Huizong Commentary* says:\n*\"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao. When things arise through it, that is called virtue-power.\"*\nThe Dao is ever nameless—how could it be described?\nThus, its virtue-power is made divine.\n\nVirtue-power has a defined form, which all may share,\nand through this, the Dao is revealed.\nWhen nature is refined and returns to virtue-power,\nvirtue-power reaches back to its origin—\nthus, it follows only the Dao.\n\n*The Cushui Explanation* says:\n*\"The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang.\nYin and yang together constitute the Dao.\nTo generate without possession is called the Mysterious Virtue-Power.\nWhen things arise through it, that is called virtue-power.\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless, without form to be seen—\nthus, it cannot be described in words.\nVirtue-power has a fixed form, and all that is born is complete within it,\nso it is what all may share.\n\nYet virtue-power encompasses the Dao,\nand the Dao is what makes virtue-power manifest.\nThus, the nameless Dao divinizes its virtue-power;\nthe Dao disperses into virtue-power,\nand virtue-power illuminates the Dao’s obscurity.\nThus, when virtue-power is refined and returns to its origin,\nit aligns with the initial state—\nvirtue-power, returning to the nameless origin,\nbecomes one with the Dao.\nThis is why it follows only the Dao.\n\nThe Dao, as a thing, is but vague and indistinct.\n\n*The Huizong Commentary* says:\n*\"The Dao’s essence is ultimate emptiness, yet its function is wondrous manifestation—\nthus it is a thing, though all things are the Dao.\n‘Vague’ refers to the visible forms that may be glimpsed.\n‘Indistinct’ refers to the numbers that may be traced.\nYet what is called ‘having’ is but doubt of the ‘none’—\nhence, the Dao as a thing.\"*\n\n*The Cushui Explanation* says:\n*\"The Dao has essence and function.\nSpeaking of its essence, it has never been a thing—\nthis is called ultimate emptiness.\nSpeaking of its function, it responds without exhaustion—\nthis is called wondrous manifestation.\nUltimate emptiness reveals itself as wondrous manifestation—\nthis is why it is a thing.\nWondrous manifestation arises from ultimate emptiness,\nso all things are the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing is seen in its vagueness and indistinctness.\n‘Vague’ has no fixed form—only the mind can conceive it—\nthus, it is a visible form that may be glimpsed.\n‘Indistinct’ marks the beginning of numbers—\nnumbers arise from it—\nthus, it is a sequence that may be traced.\nVague and indistinct—\nsometimes it seems to have form, sometimes not—\nthis is called ‘having’ while doubting ‘none.’\nThe Dao as a thing—\nis this not its subtle presence?\n\nVague and indistinct,\nyet within them are forms.\nIndistinct and vague,\nyet within them are things.\n\n*The Huizong Commentary* says:\n*\"What is seen is called form; what takes shape is called thing.\nWithin the indistinct and vague, forms and things are complete—\nlike the Great Void transforming into wind and thunder,\nlike the Great Block becoming water and fire,\nto bring about transformation and move the numinous—\nthis is the Dao’s marvel.\"*\n\n*The Cushui Explanation* says:\n*\"Things arise, and then forms appear—\nthus, form is the precursor to auspiciousness, hence ‘seen’ is called form.\nThe four seasons disperse their essence into things—\nthus, things are confined to having shape, hence ‘shape’ is called thing.\nThings and forms emerge from the indistinct and vague—\nlike wind sweeping through the mountains, thunder shaking the heavens,\nchanging the Great Void;\nlike water flowing downward, fire blazing upward,\ntransforming the Great Block.\nThus, they bring about transformation—\ninsects enter and exit plants, life and death all depend on this to complete.\nThus, they move the numinous—\nfrom shaped beings to the formless, from sentient to the unsentient,\nall depend on this to act.\nThe Dao’s marvel is seen in this.\n\nMysterious and dark,\nyet within them is essence.\n\n*The Huizong Commentary* says:\n*\"‘Mysterious’ is the utmost depth of seclusion.\n‘Dark’ is the hidden source of brightness.\nWithin the mysterious and dark lies the origin of ultimate yin,\nwhere Heaven’s One manifests, and essence truly arises.\"*\n\n*The Cushui Explanation* says:\n*\"Seclusion in a cave is hard to see—thus, ‘mysterious’ is the utmost depth of seclusion.\nThe sun hides for six days—thus, ‘dark’ is the hidden source of brightness.\nAbove the Great Brightness lies the origin of ultimate yang,\nso within the mysterious and dark lies the origin of ultimate yin.\nThe origin of ultimate yin, in the five phases, is north.\nHeaven’s One generates water in the north, which in humans is essence.\nThus, within the mysterious and dark lies the source of essence.\n\nIts essence is most true,\nand within it lies sincerity.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nits name does not fade.\n\n*The Huizong Commentary* says:\n*\"Essence is the utmost of Heaven’s virtue.\nIt is upright and without deceit—hence, ‘most true.’\nIt is singular and unchanging—hence, ‘sincerity.’\nThus, it endures without interruption, and its name does not fade.\"*\n\n*The Cushui Explanation* says:\n*\"Essence is what the One generates, and Heaven attains the One to become pure—\nthus, essence is the utmost of Heaven’s virtue.\nThe *Book of Changes* speaks of the seven virtues of *Qian*, and ‘pure’ is one—\nthus, essence is Heaven’s virtue, is it not clear?\nAttaining the One to be born, the unformed has its portion—\nthus, it is singular and unchanging—is this not sincerity?\nIf so, then all things from beginning to end are thus,\nand the essence of the One pervades without interruption—\nthis is why its name does not fade.\n\nTo observe the transformations of the myriad beginnings—\nhow do I know the myriad beginnings are thus?\nBecause of this.\n\n*The Huizong Commentary* says:\n*\"The transformations of the myriad beginnings are ever-passing without halt.\nThe utmost essence is ever-present without fading.\nThe Sage values essence, thus able to observe the transformations of the myriad beginnings\nand know their reason.\"*\n\nTo remain without

and decay transform into divine marvels—\nThe transformations of the myriad beginnings\nAre thus ever-passing without halt.\nThe One’s essence, harmonized with Heaven’s order,\nIs why the utmost truth remains ever-present without fading.\nThe Sage values essence,\nAnd thus attains the Dao from ancient times to today—\nIts name never fading.\n\nIn the ebb and flow of waxing and waning,\nEnding only to begin anew,\nHe speaks of the grand principle’s method,\nDiscourses on the nature of all things—\nThus, he observes the transformations of the myriad beginnings,\nKnowing their reason without

things unfolds.\n\nOnce without thought, yet thought must arise;\nOnce without doing, yet action must follow.\nThought emerges from non-thought,\nAction from non-action—\nThus, grand achievements and abundant deeds leave their mark.\nWho but the utmost essence of the world\nCould accomplish this?\n\nThis chapter first speaks of the virtue of the utmost essence,\nAnd finally speaks of knowing the transformations of the myriad beginnings—\nFor this very reason.\n\n*[Note: \"曲则全\" (Quzequan) is a chapter title, meaning \"Flexibility Brings Wholeness.\"*]\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Yielding to things like a serpent’s wave, it preserves its form and life without loss.\"*\n\nZhuangzi says: *\"The outwardly bent conforms to others as a disciple.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"Dulling its radiance yet not obscuring, blending with dust yet not differing—greatly harmonizing with things, it twists with them, fittingly like bending. Then its body leads while the body remains, and it withdraws its body while the body survives. Such bending is how it preserves its form and life without loss.\"*\n\nZhuangzi takes *\"yielding to things like a serpent’s wave\"* as the essential principle of vitality, and says: *\"The outwardly bent conforms to others as a disciple.\"* Only by bending outwardly does one not offend others’ sentiments—is this not *flexibility brings wholeness*?\n\n**Gunzezhi (Crookedness Brings Straightness):**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"When abandoned, one does not grieve; when confined, one does not lament—thus inwardly straight without losing its uprightness.\"*\n\nThe *Yi* says: *\"The inchworm’s bending is to seek its truth.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"When abandoned and left to perish, one should grieve yet does not; when confined and made destitute, one should lament yet does not. This seems like crookedness. Yet straightness without rigidity is how it preserves its straightness. Those who take accusation for straightness only harm their integrity. Such crookedness is what is called *straightening its uprightness*.\"*\n\nThe *Yi* says: *\"The inchworm’s bending is to seek its truth.\"* Indeed, bending is how it seeks its truth—is this not *crookedness brings straightness*?\n\n**Woxiying (Hollow Brings Fullness):**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Without hoarding, there is abundance.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"Hide mountains in marshes, boats in ravines, and they vanish without trace. Hide grain in困, water in vessels, and they are easily exhausted. Only by possessing what is within—able to move without accumulation—can one then use it, and it will overflow with abundance. This is what Zhuangzi means by *without hoarding, there is abundance*.\"*\n\nIllustrated by the nature of myriad things, *hollow brings fullness*—this is clear.\n\n**Biezixin (Exhaustion Brings Renewal):**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"If winter’s enclosure is not firm, spring’s growth will not flourish.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"Only by returning to root can one hope for its teeming. With the season of killing, one can hope for its flourishing. Only by storing in winter—firmly—can spring’s abundance necessarily thrive.\"* Illustrated by the cycles of the four seasons, *exhaustion brings renewal*—this is clear.\n\n**Shaozeduo (Fewness Brings Gain, Multitude Brings Confusion):**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The Dao’s essence is not in complexity; many words and sights are not as good as simplicity. If one takes branches for the essence, one will never comprehend—this is great confusion.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"The Dao is one and only. Thus its essence is not complex. Many words must be held with simplicity; many sights must be held with clarity. Only by having many words and sights yet returning to simplicity can one gain the Dao. If the learned are confined to branches as their essence, their speech will be exhausted, and they cannot avoid entanglement. Those in great confusion will never comprehend—are these not such people?\"*\n\nZhuangzi says: *\"The Dao does not desire mixture.\"* This is the same meaning.\n\nThus, the Sage embraces *Oneness* as the model for all under Heaven.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Its manifestation is not dual, so its creation of things is boundless. Only the utmost essence of the world can become the utmost spirit of the world. The Sage embraces Oneness to guard it, unshaken in its essence, so when speaking, it becomes the Dao for all under Heaven; when acting, it becomes the standard for all under Heaven.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"Only the utmost sincerity of the world can exhaust the nature of things. Exhausting the nature of things, one can assist Heaven and Earth in their nurturing transformation, participating with them. Its manifestation is not dual—this is sincerity. Its creation of things is boundless—this is assisting Heaven and Earth in their nurturing transformation. Only Oneness can preserve essence; only essence can gather spirit. What is this Oneness? It is sincerity itself. The penetration of Oneness’s essence ensures spirit’s preservation—essence precedes, and spirit follows. Only the utmost essence of the world can become the utmost spirit of the world. Embracing Oneness alone, the Sage exhausts this.\"*\n\nIf Oneness remains unchanging, guarding it without loss, then the utmost truth’s essence is internally preserved and not scattered. Thus, spirit and essence flow in all directions—upward reaching, downward curling—transforming and nurturing myriad things, beyond representation. When compelled to speak, speech forms patterns and all under Heaven follow. When compelled to act, action forms virtue and all under Heaven emulate it.\n\nAs the *Records* say: *\"When speaking, it becomes the Dao for all under Heaven; when acting, it becomes the standard for all under Heaven—this is the model for all under Heaven.\"*\n\n**Not seeing oneself, hence clarity:**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Not being obscured by one’s own views, it illuminates without bounds, hence clarity.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"With four eyes and four ears, broadening vision and hearing without obstruction, it can illuminate the farthest reaches and know people’s true sentiments. Not being obscured by one’s own views is how it can illuminate without bounds and be clear.\"*\n\n**Not insisting on oneself, hence brilliance:**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Not clinging to one’s own correctness, yet following what is correct, then great deeds and fame shine, and all under Heaven submit—hence brilliance.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"Consulting the many, abandoning self to follow others, not using oneself yet praising what is correct—thus achieving resplendent deeds and universal peace. Not clinging to one’s own correctness, yet following what is correct is how one achieves great deeds and fame, making all under Heaven submit and thus shining.\"*\n\n**Not praising oneself, hence merit:**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The *Book of Documents* says: *You alone do not boast; none under Heaven will contend with you for merit.*\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"The Classics say: *Those who praise themselves have no merit.* The *Book of Documents* says: *Having goodness, yet losing it.* Able not to boast of merit, so others do not contend, and its merit does not vanish.\"*\n\nYu’s command to Yu the Great said: *\"You alone do not boast, and none under Heaven will contend with you for merit.\"* Could this be what is meant?\n\nNot self-aggrandizing, hence enduring.\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The Classics say: You alone do not boast, and none under Heaven will contend with you for ability.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"The Classics say: Those who boast do not endure. The Classics say: Boast of one’s abilities, and one loses one’s merit. Only by not boasting of one’s abilities does one ensure others do not contend, and the common people align with one’s merit.\"* Yu’s command to Yu the Great said: *\"You alone do not boast, and none under Heaven will contend with you for ability.\"* Could this be what is meant?\n\nHe who does not contend, hence none can contend with him.\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"All take precedence, yet he alone remains last, saying, ‘I receive the filth of the world.’ If such, he always dwells in the realm of non-contention—who can contend with him?\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"The multitude values strength over virtue and seeks to surpass others, hence all take precedence. The Sage does not dare to lead the world but follows the Way in humility, thus he alone remains last. Remaining last, he knows white yet embraces black, knows honor yet embraces disgrace—honor and disgrace are seen equally, and he does not burden his heart with self-indulgence. This is called receiving the filth of the world. If so, he presents humility and weakness as his exterior, yet his interior is vast and unspoiled, preserving all things. Dwelling in non-contention, he accumulates countless small victories into great ones. Always in non-contention, who can contend with him? The ancients spoke of ‘yielding to preserve wholeness’—was this not truth? Truly whole, and thus it returns.*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The Sage’s actions flow like water, interacting with all yet never diminishing his wholeness. His responses align like a plumb line, following principle yet never losing their straightness. Knowing that emptiness brings fullness, he bears no burden of excess. Knowing that decay brings renewal, he leaves no trace of arrogance. Like nature acting of itself, unaware of its doing, he merely attains yielding. Thus, whole and returning, he can preserve his life, fulfill his years, yet remain unaware of their end. This is called the person of perfect virtue—was this not truth?\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"Water conforms to the vessel’s shape, round or square—none can contend with it. The Sage’s actions are thus, enabling him to yield to all while preserving his form and life, as said: ‘His actions flow like water, interacting with all, yet never diminishing his wholeness.’ The plumb line is gathered and tied, its nature ever straight. The Sage’s responses are thus, enabling him to follow things’ crookedness while his straightness remains within, as said: ‘His responses align like a plumb line, following principle, yet never losing their straightness.’ Knowing that emptiness brings fullness, he thus attains great fullness like a void, humbly tending himself—what burden of excess? Knowing that decay brings renewal, he harmonizes his brilliance and waits in obscurity, never boasting—what trace of arrogance? All this is not a forced understanding of yielding and crookedness but a natural alignment, as if by instinct, emptying himself to respond, not clashing with things, merely attaining yielding. Thus, whole and returning, he can preserve his life without fear of peril, fulfill his years without fear of early death, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, enduring yet unaware of his end. Such is the person of perfect virtue—was this not truth? Truly whole, and thus it returns.*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: *Hishen Ziran* (Rare Speech, Natural)**\nRare Speech, Natural.\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Rare—standing alone above all things, not opposing them, as the *Liezi* speaks of ‘doubtful solitude.’ Discarding knowledge and artifice, following Heaven’s principle, and not laboring externally, hence ‘natural.’\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"The *Dao De Jing* says: *Listening yet not hearing is called rare.* The *De Jing* says: *Great sound is rare in voice.* Rare—broad yet with gaps, not heard by the ear—this is standing alone above all things, not opposing them. The *Liezi* speaks of ‘non-being as doubtful solitude’—non-being can generate life, non-being thus doubts its solitude, none can pair with it—could this be the meaning of ‘rare solitude’? Thus, he discards his sharpness and wisdom, abandons knowledge and artifice, harmonizes with Heaven’s virtue, and follows Heaven’s principle, standing firm in his place, not laboring externally—this is not what others can achieve, hence ‘natural.’ Therefore, gusts of wind do not last a morning, sudden rains do not last a day. Who does this? Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\n---\n\nHeaven and Earth themselves cannot endure long—how much less can they be matched by humans?\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nWhen Heaven and Earth create all things, the wind disperses them, allowing all forms to transform naturally, while rain nourishes them, letting all things grow spontaneously. Thus, they neither augment life nor spur completion, yet all things flourish between Heaven and Earth—this is how they endure long.\n\nWhen gusts become relentless (*piāofēng*) and rains sudden (*zhòuyǔ*), yin and yang suffer discord and conflict. If one forces intervention, harm befalls the things—thus they cannot endure long.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nHeaven bestows, Earth generates—all things thrive together. Yet nothing disrupts life more swiftly than wind, nor nourishes it more deeply than water. Thus, the wind stirs and animates all forms, entrusting their transformation so that things may flourish freely; rain moistens and enriches all things, allowing them to grow luxuriant. It acts through natural course, not by augmenting life or aiding growth. Thus, life and transformation unfold in form and color between Heaven and Earth—this is the Way of enduring long.\n\nBut when wind grows fierce and swirling (*piāozhuǎn*), and rain gathers violently (*zhòujù*), this is not the harmony of yin and yang but the calamity of discord. To things, it brings augmentation and forced completion, not natural course—thus they suffer harm. How could such endure long?\n\nTherefore, those who follow the Dao:\n—Those aligned with the Dao are one with the Dao;\n—Those aligned with virtue are one with virtue;\n—Those aligned with loss are one with loss.\n\nThose aligned with the Dao gain the Dao;\nThose aligned with virtue gain virtue;\nThose aligned with loss gain loss.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nRarity (*xī*) means no external striving—beyond sound’s silence, awakening solely through innate awareness, merging with the Dao yet not entangled with things. How could virtue be named, or loss be burdened?\n\nOnly those unaware of the natural transformation of solitude mistake the Dao as difficult to know, difficult to practice—as if climbing to Heaven, beyond reach. Thus they labor mind and body in pursuit of the Dao, clinging to one-sidedness or obscured by narrowness, and the Dao is rent for all under Heaven.\n\nThose aligned with the Dao are one with the Dao,\nThose aligned with virtue are one with virtue,\nThose aligned with loss are one with loss—\nyet if they do not attain their own attainment,\nthen their attainment is itself a kind of loss.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nTo stand alone above all things, not laboring externally—this is rarity. Able to discard sharpness and wisdom, silently recognizing harmony in soundlessness, alone in hearing the true resonance—thus merging with the Dao, beyond pairing with things.\n\nWhen the Dao reaches this, there is neither gain nor loss—what virtue can be named, what loss can be burdened? The ignorant cannot dawn upon solitude, thus they do not know the natural transformation of solitude.\n\nThe Dao is inherently easy to know, yet none under Heaven knows it—thus it is deemed difficult to know.\nThe Dao is inherently easy to practice, yet none under Heaven practices it—thus it is deemed difficult to practice.\n\nSome seek the Dao in the distant heights, as if climbing to Heaven and unreachable, unaware that the lower one descends, the more it is attained—unconstrained by heights. Though their minds may fixate, straining their thoughts, or their skills may weary their bodies in pursuing the Dao—what could they attain?\n\nTo pursue it thus is to grasp one-sidedness in the Dao, to cling to narrowness in things—the Dao’s wholeness is thus fractured.\n\nMankind is born with inherent solitude, unchanging in nature, yet if they pursue the Dao, my so-called \"standing alone above all things\" is now subservient to the Dao. Though they attain virtue or loss in three degrees, it is not their own attainment—only converging in loss.\n\nFaith is insufficient, thus there is doubt.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nFaith means no deception. Deception arises from true and false—if one takes the Dao as true and things as false, then faith is insufficient, and doubt arises. The disciples of Hui Shi and Han Fei all strayed far from the Dao because of insufficient faith.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nThe Classic says: *\"The trustworthy, I trust; the untrustworthy, I also trust—this is true trust.\"* Though all things differ, none are without substance. To regard the untrustworthy as trustworthy is true trust.\n\nOnly those who know the Dao does not contradict things, yet do not take the Dao as true knowledge, nor things as false—thus there is nowhere without trust.\n\nBut those with insufficient faith arise from delusion, taking the Dao as true and things as false, unaware of the whole, and thus generate distinctions. Hence, those with insufficient faith also have doubt.\n\nLike Hui Shi’s love of paradoxes, Han Fei’s rigid legalism—unaware that true and false merge in unity, and those who separate them stray far from the Dao—all because of insufficient faith.\n\n**End of *Dao Xuē Zhēn Jīng* Exegesis, Volume Five** #1: *\"Then then\"*—likely a scribal error.\n**Volume Six of *Moral Virtue True Classic* Exegesis**\nBy the Imperial Scholar Jiang Cheng’s Commentary.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: \"The Unsteady Cannot Stand\"**\n\nThe unsteady cannot stand; the overreaching cannot move.\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: To stand while unsteady, to move while overreaching—these defy nature’s norm, yet hope for bodily ease. How difficult!\n\nIf one follows *virtue/power* as their guide, then all who have sufficient grounding will arrive.\nThe Exegesis says: The unsteady leans but does not stand firm, yet still they cannot doubt that standing is possible. The overreaching strides but does not hasten, yet still they cannot doubt that they can move with ease. To stand while unsteady, to move while overreaching—these are those who cannot rest in tranquility, cannot align with nature, and thus cannot cease. To defy nature’s norm, yet hope for bodily ease, how difficult!\n\nOnly those who *follow their nature* and find self-sufficiency, who take *virtue/power* as their guide, and do not force or distort things as false—only these will arrive where they have sufficient grounding. Like the childless *Master Shushan* and *Wang Dai*, who lacked feet yet reached everywhere.\n\nThose who see only themselves are not enlightened; those who insist on their own correctness do not shine; those who boast of their own merits have no true accomplishment; those who pride themselves in their abilities do not endure.\nIn the Dao, this is called *excessive consumption* and *superfluous action*.\n\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: Self-perception leads to insufficient wisdom to encompass all things, hence lack of enlightenment. Insisting on one’s own correctness means *virtue/power* is insufficient to harmonize with the multitude, hence lack of brilliance. They possess merit, yet lose it; they boast of their abilities, yet lose their efficacy. Where the Dao resides, it takes *depth* as its root and *simplicity* as its measure. Excessive display and lustful ambition—how could these be the Dao?\n\nThus, in eating, it is called *excess*; in action, it is called *superfluous*. Both are external adornments, not intrinsic.\nSome may detest them, hence the Daoist does not dwell there.\n\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: Luxury beyond nature leads to excess, which is what the heavens lack, the earth transforms, and people abhor. Hence, the Daoist does not dwell there.\n\nThe Exegesis says: The Dao of heaven lacks excess and instead fosters humility; the Dao of earth transforms excess into humility; the Dao of humanity abhors excess and cherishes humility. If one indulges in excessive display and lustful ambition, they are luxuriating beyond nature and filling themselves with excess. They should be what the heavens lack, the earth transforms, and people abhor. The Sage does not so. They always present *gentleness, weakness, humility, and modesty* as their outward form. Those who do not know that fullness brings burden and excess strains nature, yet indulge in self-swelling, should be what the Daoist does not dwell in.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: \"The Formless Mixture\"**\n\nThere is a formless mixture that arises before heaven and earth.\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: *Qi* and form are complete yet undifferentiated—this is *primordial chaos*. To merge with *primordial chaos* means their completion is unmarred. This is what the *Yijing* calls the *Great Polarity*. Heaven and earth also depend on this before they arise, hence it is said to arise before heaven and earth. Yet it is not the ineffable mystery of non-arising, hence it is called *thing*.\n\nThe Exegesis says: *Great Beginning* is the origin of *qi*; *Great Purity* is the origin of form. Before these three are differentiated, they are called *primordial chaos*. In the initial state of *primordial chaos*, the *Great Uncarved* has not yet dispersed—this is what the *Yijing* calls the *Great Polarity*. Thus, to merge with *primordial chaos* means their completion is unmarred. The *Yijing* has the *Great Polarity*, which gives rise to the *Two Principles*. The *Great Polarity* is the source from which the *Two Principles* emerge, hence heaven and earth depend on it to arise. To enter *non-arising*, then *qi* is undifferentiated and *primordial chaos* is merged in the ineffable profundity. To descend into *arising*, then the light and clear separate from the heavy and turbid, manifesting in forms. Arising—how could this be the ineffable profundity of non-arising? It is called *thing*, and this is its proper designation.\n\nSilent and boundless,\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: Silent and boundless means it does not engage in movement, nor does it interact with things. It is pure and complete in itself.\n\nThe Exegesis says: Silent and unmoving means the silent has never engaged in movement. *Great Emptiness* is boundless and vast, meaning the boundless has never interacted with things. Not engaging in movement, not interacting with things—then it has no sound, no scent, pure and complete in itself.\n\nIndependent yet unchanging,\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: Great constancy sustains it, unyielding to transformation—this speaks to the Dao’s essence.\n\nThe Exegesis says: From its own root and foundation, ancient and unshaken, nothing can topple it, no change can displace it. This is called *great constancy sustaining it*. If so, then all transformations are boundless, yet the Dao remains ever the same. Is this not the Dao’s essence?\n\nCirculating endlessly without exhaustion,\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: It benefits all things in their arising and passing, moving ceaselessly—this speaks to the Dao’s function.\n\nThe Exegesis says: When things arise, it arises with them; when things pass, it passes with them. All people rely on it, and wherever it goes, it endures. This is called *benefiting all things in their arising and passing*. If so, then in every arising and passing, yet it is always inexhaustible. Is this not the Dao’s function?\n\nIt can be the mother of all under heaven.\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: All things depend on it for their arising.\n\nThe Exegesis says: That which is born cannot give birth to itself—only that which does not itself arise can give birth to all things. Therefore, all things must rely upon the Dao to arise. The Classic says: *\"All things depend upon it to arise, yet it does not decline.\"* It also says: *\"The world has a beginning, and it is called the Mother of the world.\"* I do not know its name, so I call it *Dao*, and forcefully name it thus.\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Things arise, and only then do they take form; they take form, and only then do they flourish; they flourish, and only then do they take measure. Names arise from reality, and reality has its measure—thus, naming is but the flourishing. The Dao is ever nameless, so when we name it with the greatest term, it is in contrast to the lesser. Thus, it can be named.\n\nThe Dao’s subtlety is small and profound; the Dao’s centrality is great and manifest.\n*The Exegesis says:* Left Scholar says: Things arise, and only then do they take form; they take form, and only then do they flourish; they flourish, and only then do they take measure. Things arise with water—water gathers and flourishes, this is flourishing. That which can be gathered into clusters, dispersed into branches, this is measure. Flourishing is the preliminary appearance of measure, before it congeals into form. Measure is the completed flourishing, fixed within a solid body. When things are formed and their measure is set, their abundance or scarcity becomes apparent—this is where names arise. Thus, names arise from reality, and reality has its measure.\n\nNaming and giving it a childlike designation—this is the meaning of naming, so naming is but flourishing. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the Dao generates heaven and earth, so the Dao is ever nameless. The subtlest of subtleties, the most vast of vastness—thus, the great is the contrast to the small. The nameless is the Dao’s subtlety; the Dao’s subtlety is small and profound, hence this. Therefore, naming it as great is the Dao’s centrality; the Dao’s centrality is great and manifest, hence this. Thus, it can be named.\n\nWhen manifest in the utmost transformation, it is great and interacts with all things. When returning to the utmost profundity, it is small and distinguishes itself from all things. Only in its interaction with all things can it be named as great—covering and nurturing all things, viewing them equally with benevolence, encompassing all without distinction. Only in its distinction from all things can it be named as small—action through stillness, creation through repose, returning to its Dao without departing from its nature.\n\nWhen interacting with all things, it is as the *Classic* says: *\"In speaking of the far, it is unconstrained.\"* When distinguishing itself from all things, it is as the *Classic* says: *\"In speaking of the near, it is still and correct.\"* The Dao’s distance from its root is far—its departure runs without pause, responds without exhaustion. Far, it is unconstrained—is this not the time of its interaction with all things? The Dao’s return to its root is near—it returns to its root in stillness, stillness as returning to its command. Near, it is still and correct—is this not the time of its distinction from all things?\n\nThus, the Dao is great; heaven is great; earth is great; the Sage-King is great.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* The Dao covers and nurtures heaven and earth. Heaven covers all without exception; earth bears all without omission. The Sage-King occupies the central position between heaven and earth, aligning with them—thus, he too is great.\n\n*The Exegesis says:* The Dao precedes the Supreme Ultimate yet is not lofty; it lies beneath the Six Extremes yet is not deep. As Liezi says: *\"Beyond heaven and earth, there is no greater heaven and earth.\"* Thus, the Dao can cover and nurture heaven and earth. The light and pure gather above as heaven—when its expanse is boundless, stars and all things are without exception covered. The heavy and turbid settle below as earth—when its breadth and depth are vast, mountains and seas are without omission borne. The Sage-King embodies this, positioned within, harmonizing the Three Powers with mutual communication, distinguishing the Three Extremes with their own essences. Thus, he can emulate heaven and earth within himself. This is why the four great things within the realm are so.\n\nYet, though not inherently great, they are ranked as great—still not departing from form. From the Supreme One, divided into four—still not departing from measure. Though having form yet not obstructed by form, though having measure yet not constrained by measure—this is how it is great.\n\nWithin the realm, there are four great things, and the Sage-King occupies one of them.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Descending from the Dao, there are square forms—thus, it is called the realm. Stillness is sagely; action is kingly. One who unifies the Three Powers and harmonizes human conduct—this is the utmost.\n\n---\n\nThus, he shares the same essence as the Dao, the same function as heaven and earth, yet is still called great. *Cushiyi* says: Before the Dao descends, it is unified in the boundless void with no division, hence the earlier reference to the \"mixed and complete Dao.\" Once dispersed, it is confined within square forms and thus visible, hence the current mention of the \"realm.\"\n\nThe square form does not depart from the original essence of the Heavenly Dao—this is why it is said to be still and sagely. When it manifests in the rise of the Sage-King, this is why it is said to be active and kingly. Only when one transitions from stillness to action, from sagely virtue to kingly power, can he harmonize the Three Powers and fulfill the ultimate extent of human conduct.\n\nAs for the Sage-King’s undertakings and achievements, one who surpasses others in this is the king. One who surpasses others in this is akin to heaven, for the king’s capacity to fulfill human conduct is the same as heaven’s. The *Sutra* states: \"The king is heaven.\" Is this not the Dao’s utmost perfection?\n\nWithin the realm, the four great things are thus, and the Sage-King resides in one of them. Now, the Dao is hidden and nameless—only he who dwells with it can comprehend it. Since he shares the same essence as the Dao, and heaven and earth establish their positions, while the Sage-King perfects his abilities, they all share the same function. Thus, the Dao, heaven and earth, and the Sage-King all originate from the same source, unified and harmonized, fulfilling human conduct to become one with heaven, embodying heaven to become one with the Dao—there is no distinction to be observed.\n\nHumans follow the earth, the earth follows the heavens, the heavens follow the Dao, and the Dao follows *ziran* [自然].\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Humans refer to the Sage-King. The heavens do not act yet all things transform; the earth does not grow yet all things nurture. The Sage-King acts without effort yet achieves the world’s prosperity—what he follows is the Dao’s *ziran* alone.\n\nThe Dao follows *ziran* because it responds to things. *Ziran* is not the Dao in its entirety, but when it emerges to respond to things, the Dao descends to follow it as well.\n*Cushiyi* says: Earlier, it was said that the Dao is great, the heavens are great, the earth is great, and the Sage-King is also great. Here, it is said that humans follow the earth—thus, it is known that \"humans\" refers to the Sage-King.\n\nThe heavens act without effort, yet remain clear; they allow all things to flourish naturally, thus not \"producing\" yet all things transform—this is the divine essence of the heavens. The earth acts without effort, yet remains tranquil; it entrusts all forms to their own growth, thus not \"lengthening\" yet all things are nurtured—this is the richness of the earth. Above, the Sage-King must act without effort to govern the world; below, he must act with purpose for the world’s benefit. To govern without effort yet achieve the world’s prosperity—this is the greatness of the Sage-King. These three principles are all derived from following the Dao’s *ziran*.\n\nIndeed, humans do not fail to follow the heavens, yet it is said they follow the earth; the earth does not fail to follow the Dao, yet it is said to follow the heavens. This is because when speaking of the Dao, there must be an order. Ultimately, all originate from *ziran*—thus, it concludes with \"the Dao follows *ziran*.\"\n\nEven if discussing things, *ziran* is above them; if not discussing things, *ziran* is below them. From *ziran* arises the other, and from *ziran* comes extinction—*ziran* is not the Dao in its entirety. Yet the Dao follows it, emerging to respond to things, and thus its following is a descent to lower realms.\nZhuangzi said: \"To respond in accordance with *ziran*—this is the Dao.\"\nIs this not what is meant?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as the Light’s Root, Stillness as the Lord of Agitation**\nThe heavy serves as the root of the light, stillness as the lord of agitation. Thus, the virtuous one walks all day without straying from his burden.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* The heavy does not sway or be stolen away, yet remains steadfast—thus, it serves as the root of the light. The still does not move recklessly, yet maintains control—thus, it lords over agitation.\n\nWith stillness and heaviness to sustain oneself, few will lose their way. The virtuous one walks all day without straying from his burden—thus, though he treads cautiously, he fears no mishap.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: Yang Xiong said: \"Take the four heavy things.\" Heavy means one does not grow light. The *Sutra* states: \"Hold steadfast to stillness.\" Stillness means one does not falter. Only when one does not grow light can things not displace him, and his center remains unshaken—thus, he is not swayed or stolen away, yet remains steadfast. Only when one does not falter can he not rush forward recklessly, yet respond to all movements—thus, he is not moved recklessly, yet maintains control.\n\nHeaviness with steadfastness is why it serves as the root of the light;\nStillness with control is why it lords over agitation.\nTo be able to guard oneself with stillness means all movements cannot displace;\nTo be able to sustain oneself with heaviness means external things cannot overwhelm.\nFew will lose their way—this is indeed his nature.\n\nAll things in motion have burdens; thus, they are heavy and slow. Without burdens, they are light and swift.\nMovement is swift when light, yet it must rely on burdens to sustain itself. Though he treads cautiously, he fears no midway困 [困], hence no mishap.\n\nThough there are grand spectacles, he must first attain tranquil repose to rise above them.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Grand spectacles belong to things; tranquil repose belongs to the self. Only when the self is at ease can one enjoy the things around him.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: Zhuangzi said: \"When colors are paired, the five hues are disordered, and intricate patterns scatter the pure and the yellow in dazzling confusion.\" This is why grand spectacles belong to things. Mencius said: \"The four limbs are for ease and repose.\" This is why tranquil repose belongs to the self. King Wen of Zhou, in his leisure, first ascended to the shore—his body was at ease, and then the pleasures of the terrace and pond appeared in his spirit. Only when the body is at ease can one enjoy things—this is evident here. Thus, though there are grand spectacles, one must first attain tranquil repose to rise above them.\n\nHow can a ruler of ten thousand chariots govern the world with a light heart?\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* The world is a great thing. To have great things is to be solemn, as if driving six horses with a rotting rein—thus, one cannot govern the world with a light heart.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: To act without effort and commit few faults is easy; to act with purpose yet bear no burdens is difficult. Can one who governs the world easily undertake such deeds? Yu praised Yao, saying, \"Only the Emperor finds it difficult,\" and Tang said of himself, \"I tremble with fear and anxiety.\" All who act with purpose find it difficult because of the burden of not being without effort. Thus, to have great things, one must be solemn as if driving six horses with a rotting rein—thus, one cannot govern the world with a light heart.\n\nLightness leads to losing one’s ministers, haste leads to losing one’s subjects.\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* If one does not weigh actions solemnly, there will be no authority, hence one loses one’s ministers. If one does not lead but merely harmonizes, one transgresses proper distinctions, hence one loses one’s subjects.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: A dignified bearing naturally commands respect—this is the way of things. Without such weight, there is no authority. The ruler holds supreme dignity while ministers are lowly; only the ruler’s dignity matters, so one must not act lightly.\n\nThe ruler initiates, the ministers follow—this is the natural order. If the ruler does not lead yet the ministers harmonize, they overstep their roles. The ruler must act first, so one must not be hasty.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Virtue of Benevolent Conduct**\nBenevolent conduct leaves no trace.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* What is preserved is the Dao, what is manifested is transformation—thus, no trace remains.\n*Cushiyi* says: The Dao is formless and boundless, yet it abides in harmony. Thus, what is preserved is the Dao. Transformation arises through the shifting of forms and is subject to traces—thus, what is manifested is transformation. Those who dwell in the Dao preserve without seeking, while those who dwell in traces pass through without guarding their steps. Such conduct should leave no trace behind.\n\nBenevolent words bear no flaws or reproach.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* In harmony with the Dao’s natural flow, unfolding without constraint—thus, no flaws or reproach remain.\nWords and deeds are grand in scope: they begin with contemplation and end in transformation. Only the Sage can perfect words and deeds, achieving the marvel of transformation—thus, benevolent conduct leaves no trace to follow, and benevolent words bear no reproach to burden.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: *Tianni* refers to the origin of nature and life. *Manyan* refers to boundless change. If one aligns with the origin of nature and life, and follows with boundless change, then words spoken may endure all day, and words spoken may exhaust the Dao. Such words should bear no reproach.\n\nMoreover, considering the *Yijing*:*\nThe *xiang* are the most refined patterns of the world—gentlefolk emulate them in speech.\nThe *yao* are the most dynamic forces of the world—gentlefolk act in accordance with them.\n\nWords and deeds rest with humanity, while transformation belongs to Heaven and Earth.\nWords and deeds begin with contemplation and end in transformation—thus, words and deeds are the pivot and mechanism of the gentlefolk.\n\nOnly the Sage comprehends the essence of words, making them the foundation of conduct. With such words, one can respond to distant affairs as if at hand, and govern the movement of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe marvel of transformation is complete within oneself. If one acts thus, then conduct leaves no trace—coming and going alone, following only the grand Dao. What trace could there be?\n\nIf one speaks thus, then words conform to the law, set forth with divine intent, bearing no stain. What reproach could burden?\n\nBenevolent planning does not rely on calculations.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* To grasp unity is to master all things—what need for numbers? Thus, calculations are unnecessary, yet myriad changes unfold as if counted one by one.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: To know unity is to know all things, for all things in the world arise from unity. To grasp unity is to complete all affairs. Once one has achieved unity, one transcends numbers. To transcend numbers yet generate them is even more wondrous—how much more so to not rely on numbers yet bring them forth? It is fitting that no calculations are needed, for myriad changes, though seemingly countless, unfold as if counted one by two.\n\nBenevolent closure requires no bolts or bars yet cannot be opened.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Sealing the path guards the Dao, retreat hides in profound mystery.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: Closing the mouth and sealing the gate, one holds fast to the Dao’s essence—none can alter its truth. *Tunna* guards the Dao thus. Zhuangzi said: \"Without seeing or hearing, embracing the Dao in stillness—this is near the mark.\" The small mound and deep roots, the hidden position and concealed boundaries, yet the world cannot perceive its traces. Retreat hides in profound mystery—Zhuangzi said: \"Hidden in the measureless rhythms of the Dao—this is near the mark.\" If one abides thus, though no bolts or bars are used, who could open it? This is called benevolent closure.\n\nBenevolent binding requires no cords or fetters yet cannot be undone.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* To depend on cords and fetters for binding is to diminish one’s nature. Some do not speak yet nourish others with harmony; they stand alongside others yet transform them—binding without cords, who could undo it?\n\n*Cushiyi* says: The world has its constants—one’s true nature is the origin, born with life, steadfast and unyielding. Why depend on cords and fetters for binding? To depend on cords and fetters is to harm one’s true nature and scatter one’s purity—thus, it diminishes one’s nature. The benevolent binder does not act thus: they water others’ hearts with perfect harmony, needing no words. They align with the Dao’s essence, causing others’ intentions to dissolve without relying on force. This is Zhuangzi’s meaning: \"Some do not speak yet nourish others with harmony; they stand alongside others yet transform them\"—precisely this.\n\nIf so, then attachment and separation do not require glue or lacquer, and bonds do not require ropes or knots. Who could undo it?\n\nThus, the Sage always benevolently rescues people, so none are abandoned.\nThe Sage always benevolently rescues things, so none are abandoned.\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Benevolence is the continuation of the Dao. To abide in the Dao is to transcend named benevolence. Once benevolence is named, the Dao emerges and the world is transformed. The Sage embodies the Dao to benefit the world—thus, these five benevolences extend to people and things without abandoning any.\n\nYet the Sage’s way of loving people and benefiting things, allowing them to flourish and for humanity to rejoice in their nature, is not a matter of intention. It is to return to their constant state, following the Dao’s natural flow.\n\nThe world has lost the Dao. All under Heaven have abandoned their tranquil, solemn, still, and vast nature, and daily sink into the realm of suffering. Who but the Sage can save them?\n\n*Cushiyi* says: The *Yijing* says: \"One yin and one yang—the Dao. To continue it is benevolence.\" Thus, benevolence is the continuation of the Dao, returning to the origin of the Great Dao. Then, benevolence and evil are merely distinctions that cannot be fully separated—thus, there is no named benevolence.\n\nWhen benevolence is sung of as a virtue to be celebrated, it is rooted in the Dao, and thus its goodness encompasses all under Heaven—this is how the name of benevolence is established.\n\nFrom virtuous deeds to perfect harmony, the Sage’s five benevolences extend without abandoning any, for they embody the ability to embody the Dao and thereby save all under Heaven.\n\nThe Sage loves and rescues people, letting them rejoice in life, and benefits and rescues things, letting them fulfill their nature—what need is there for deliberate intent? Returning to the One without trace, following the Dao without deviation, conforming to their natural state, riding the rites without obstruction, and letting all things fulfill their roles while the people govern themselves—this is all.\n\nYet if not for such a person, the Dao cannot act in vain, nor can it flourish in the world. Thus, the people lose their tranquil, solemn, still, and vast nature, becoming confined and chaotic, weary and burdened, daily sinking into the realm of suffering. Without one to nurture and guide them, how can they avoid corrupting their nature or straying from their virtue?\n\nIt is not the duty of those who teach and transform to bear the weight of the world with the Dao, to bring forth the Dao and benefit the world, so that the people and things may each find peace in their natural essence—who else could achieve the function of perfect benevolence and salvation?\n\nThis is called *clothing in brightness* (袭明).\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** *Clothing* means to reveal without display.\nClothing in brightness shines yet does not dazzle.\n\n**Explication:** The dragon, as a creature, can be seen and can hide. *Clothing* means to hide while not yet revealed. Because it hides, when its scales are within, *clothing* carries the meaning of revealing without display—akin to the *clothing* in *\"inciting and clothing\"* (惕袭) that does not follow sequentially.\n\nClothing in brightness removes the slippery doubt of dazzling and the scheming brilliance of form, for it does not flaunt its own light. The Sage’s way in the world is to be a boundless source of wisdom, yet outwardly appears dim—this is why it is so.\n\nThus, the virtuous person is the teacher of the unvirtuous; the unvirtuous person is the resource of the virtuous.\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** *Resource* speaks to its utility—only when there is unvirtue does one recognize the utility of virtue.\n\n**Explication:** All paths of utility can be transformed into wealth or used as bribes, but *resource* refers to secondary utility. Thus, *resource* speaks to utility, showing that when virtue is evident, one must preserve it, and when unvirtue appears, one must reflect upon it. Only then, with the existence of the unvirtuous, does the function and utility of the virtuous become apparent—this is why the unvirtuous serve as the resource of the virtuous.\n\nConfucius said: *\"When three men walk together, there is surely one who can be my teacher. I select his good qualities and follow them; I select his bad qualities and change them.\"* This is the same meaning.\n\nYet the Sage does not prize his teacher nor cherish his resource.\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** When all under Heaven know virtue as virtue, then unvirtue already exists. Virtue and unvirtue are both forgotten—there is no room for deliberate intent, so what is there to prize or cherish? This is how the Sage achieves great harmony with all things.\n\n**Explication:** In discussing the nature of things, virtue and unvirtue are unified. From the perspective of ordinary people, there is virtue, with unvirtue as its opposite. From the Sage’s perspective, both virtue and unvirtue are embraced—his heart is empty, with no preference or rejection. What is there to prize in the teacher of the unvirtuous? What is there to cherish in the resource of the virtuous? They are indistinct, forgotten, and transformed in the Dao.\n\nKnowing that the distinction between virtue and evil arises from delusion, why would one cling to fine distinctions and generate the heart of prizing or cherishing?\n\nGreat harmony with all things is seen in the Sage.\nEven the wise are utterly confused—this is called *the essential mystery* (要妙).\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** The essential mystery of the Dao lies in not perceiving the multitude of virtues, having no use for wisdom. The Seven Sages were all confused, with no path to inquire about. The meaning aligns here.\n\n**Explication:** Virtue is a deviation from the Dao; wisdom arises from the Dao’s manifestation. The essential mystery of the Dao merges virtue and evil into unity, so one does not perceive the multitude of virtues to seek them with wisdom, nor does one have any use for wisdom. Difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom, difficult to measure or recognize—this is not the realm of cleverness or daring. This is why they are utterly confused.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor was about to meet the Great Spirit (大魄) at Mount Jutzi (具茨之山), arriving at the wilds of Xiangcheng (襄城之野), where the followers of Fangming and Huaji (方明滑稽之徒) led the Seven Sages astray, leaving them utterly lost, with no path to ask. The Great Spirit is a metaphor for the essential mystery of the Dao; the Seven Sages are a metaphor for those not free from using wisdom.\n\nThe Seven Sages were all confused, with no path to ask—this demonstrates that the essential mystery of the Dao cannot be known through wisdom. The writings of Zhuang Zhou complement those of Laozi, evident here.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Heroic**\nKnow the heroic, yet hold to the yielding—\nThus you become the valley of all under Heaven.\nAs the valley of all under Heaven,\nYour constant virtue never departs,\nReturning to the infant.\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** The heroic is the strong overcoming things; the yielding is gentle and still. The Sage’s wisdom knows how to overcome things, yet he himself dwells in gentleness and stillness. All things come to him, drawing from him without depletion—thus he is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nThe valley is low, and flowing water rushes toward it—\nThis is to hold without force, yet sustain with humility,\nSo that virtue and nature remain forever united—\nThis is called *constant virtue*, returning to the infant.\nQi is harmonious yet not violent;\nNature is pure yet undispersed—\nThis is the infant.\nMencius said: *\"The noble person does not lose the heart of the infant.\"*\n\n**Explication:** The heroic is the yang, firm in body and riding upon things, thus able to overcome them with strength. The yielding is the yin, gentle in body and receiving things, thus only gentle and still.\n\nThe Sage’s wisdom can awe the world and move the heavens and earth—this is knowing how to overcome things, which is called *knowing the heroic*.\n\nThough firm in strength, he must yet be hidden and abide in gentleness;\nThough active in motion, he must yet be profound and abide in stillness—\nThus he is able to preserve the yielding.\n\nOnly by abiding in gentleness can he never be severed from things;\nOnly by abiding in stillness can he suffice to respond to all movement.\nWhen he gives to others as he does to himself, his virtue overflows abundantly,\nNever exhausted—\nThis is how he becomes the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nMoreover, the earth does not fill the east and south,\nSo all rivers and floods return to it—\nThus the valley, being low, is rightly where flowing water rushes.\n\nThe Sage preserves the yielding with gentleness and stillness,\nReceiving all things without refusal.\n\nThough the heroic involves firmness and overcoming with strength,\nAnd the yielding involves humility and overcoming with gentleness—\nThe Sage, when firm, remains submerged and hidden,\nThus he does not employ strength;\nWhen yielding, he establishes his foundation,\nThus he sustains it with humility.\n\nNot employing strength yet sustaining with humility—\nThis is truly knowing the heroic while preserving the yielding.\n\nVirtue arises from nature, originally never separated—\nIf one leans solely toward the heroic, harmony is consumed;\nIf one leans solely toward the yielding, there is nothing to establish.\nOnly by knowing the heroic while possessing firmness,\nAnd preserving the yielding while completing with gentleness—\nCan one achieve the refinement of harmony,\nFilling all that is natural,\nAnd thus the Sage’s virtue is complete—\nWhat difference is there between him and the infant?\n\nFor the infant’s qi is focused and his will is singular,\nThus he is harmonious yet not violent;\nHis desires and thoughts are not yet fully formed,\nThus he is pure yet undispersed—\nOnly when virtue and nature are forever united\nDoes he return to the infant.\n\nAs Mencius said: *\"The noble person does not lose the heart of the infant.\"*\n\nKnowing the bright, guarding the dark—\nThis is the model for all under Heaven.\n\nTo be the model for all under Heaven,\nHis constant virtue never errs,\nReturning to the Boundless.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nBrightness symbolizes virtue manifesting;\nDarkness symbolizes the Way returning.\nThe Sage reveals his luminous virtue,\nYet silently unites with the Way—\nWithout flaw, he is the standard for all under Heaven.\n\nHis joy is extended without exhaustion,\nThus he is the model for all under Heaven.\n\nHe is upright yet not arbitrary,\nTrustworthy as the four seasons,\nNever deviating—\nSuch as this, difficult to exhaust, without end,\nNever reaching an extreme—\nThus it is said: *constant virtue never errs, returning to the Boundless.*\n\nThe *Book of Documents*, in *The Grand Pivot*, speaks of the Kingly Way:\n*\"Return to its having an extreme.\"*\nLaozi speaks of being the model for all under Heaven:\n*\"Return to the Boundless.\"*\n\nExtreme means *the central way*.\nHaving an extreme refers to virtue manifesting in deeds,\nWhere centrality is the utmost.\nThe Boundless refers to virtue returning to the Way,\nWhich cannot be attained.\n\n**Explication:**\nBrightness is the center of yin, corresponding to the west,\nThe place where all treasures are completed—\nThus it symbolizes virtue manifesting.\nDarkness explores its origin, corresponding to the north,\nThe time when all things return to their root—\nThus it symbolizes the Way returning.\n\nThe Sage emits the radiance of Heaven,\nIlluminating the lower lands—\nThus his revealed virtue is the singular nature—\nThis is knowing the bright.\nRetreating and hiding in seclusion,\nNot revealing his essence—\nThus his silent unity is rooted in the Way—\nThis is guarding the dark.\n\nWith virtue and the Way fully complete,\nWithout flaw,\nHe is the standard for all under Heaven—\nHis example is followed, and all under Heaven conforms.\nWithout thought, all submit;\nHis joy is extended in his time,\nHis abundant virtue is unforgettable,\nNot exhausted by the ages—\nThus he is the model for all under Heaven.\n\nOnly by being the model for all under Heaven\nDoes his uprightness remain unchanging and unshifting,\nHis timing follow naturally and inevitably.\n\nUpright yet never erring,\nHe never acts arbitrarily—\nNot expecting as he does,\nThe four seasons’ virtue reaches this—\nWhat deviation could there be?\n\nSuch as this, the origin of true essence aligns with Heaven’s order—\nWho can fathom its end?\nWho can exhaust its limits?\n\nTruly, all transformations have no end—\nThis is why it is said: *constant virtue never errs.*\n\nAlthough the *Book of Documents*, in *The Grand Pivot*, speaks of the Kingly Way:\n*\"Return to its having an extreme,\"*\nAnd Laozi speaks of being the model for all under Heaven:\n*\"Return to the Boundless,\"*\nWhy is this so?\n\nThe *Grand Pivot* was composed by Ji Zi to elucidate the subtleties of the Way,\nWhile the *Dao De Jing* was written by Laozi to reveal the Way’s brilliance.\n\nTo elucidate the Way is to take the central harmony as the foundation,\nThus it is said: *having an extreme.*\nFor virtue manifesting in deeds,\nCentrality is the utmost.\n\nTo reveal the Way is to take the utmost clarity as the foundation,\nThus it is said: *the Boundless.*\nFor virtue returning to the Way,\nIt cannot be attained.\n\nExtreme means *the central way*,\nLike the ridgepole of a house, where all beams converge,\nLike the celestial pole, where all stars gather.\nWhether present or absent,\nEach has its proper place.\n\nKnowing the honored, guarding the humble—\nThis is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nTo be the valley of all under Heaven,\nHis constant virtue is complete,\nReturning to the Uncarved.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nBeyond nature and life, there is nothing but things.\nCommon people regard gain as honored, loss as humble,\nAbundance as honored, restraint as humble.\nOnly the Sage can view honor and humiliation equally,\nWithout preference or rejection.\n\nYet he does not aspire to extravagance,\nBut takes restraint as his measure—\nThis is emptiness alone,\nThus he is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nThe valley is empty yet able to receive,\nResponding without storing—\nWhen virtue reaches this, it is complete and exhaustive,\nNothing more can be added—\nThus it is said: *constant virtue is complete.*\n\nThe Uncarved is the whole of the Way;\nReturning to the Uncarved is to fully embody the Way.\n\nThe solitary and the orphaned do not fill the valley,\nYet kings and dukes consider themselves worthy—\nThus, embracing the Uncarved, all under Heaven becomes guest.\n\n**Explication:**\nOne nature, concentrated and still—\nPure emptiness alone.\nBeyond the self, nothing is not false—\nThus all beyond nature’s division is things.\n\nYet common people rejoice as if startled when they gain,\nAnd grieve as if startled when they lose—\nThis is regarding gain as honored, loss as humble.\n\nSome indulge in slander through wealth and nobility,\nOthers perish in poverty and lowliness—\nThis is regarding abundance as honored, restraint as humble.\n\nThe Sage knows that when things come, they cannot be rejected,\nso he does not regard gain as honored,\nand when they depart, they cannot be stopped,\nso he does not deem loss as humiliating.\n\nHonor and shame are seen equally, with no inclination to take or discard—\ndwelling within the Uncarved, yet not aspiring to the adorned.\nWithin, he preserves the undisturbed,\nand regards restraint as his standard,\nattaining the utmost emptiness of the world,\nyet without a single particle of perturbation—\nthus he becomes the world’s valley.\n\nIndeed, the valley as a thing\nis empty yet capable of receiving,\nreceives yet does not hoard,\nis empty yet capable of responding,\nresponds yet is never exhausted.\n\nIn his own virtue/power,\nits emptiness is thus—\nso he can respond to the world’s myriad fullness.\nNothing more can be added—\nthus it is said: *constant virtue is complete.*\n\nWithin emptiness and stillness,\nthere exists a formless unity—\nthe essence of the Dao/Way.\n\nWood as the Uncarved,\nbefore it is shaped into vessels,\nits substance remains whole.\n\nThe Dao’s whole essence lies here—\nif one can return to the Uncarved,\nthen he understands the Great Origin and Great Root,\nand thus fully embodies the Dao/Way.\n\nThough the solitary and orphaned lack the world’s nourishment,\nwhich common people detest,\nwhile kings and dukes esteem their own nobility—\nall recognize the Dao/Way’s root in what is honored.\n\nEmbracing the Uncarved, one attains the Dao/Way;\nthose who attain the Dao/Way receive abundant assistance—\nthus the world becomes their guest.\nEmbracing the Uncarved, the world becomes their guest—\nas the Classic says: *The Uncarved though small, none under Heaven can subdue it.*\nIf lords and kings can guard it,\nall things will naturally become their guests.\n\nThe Uncarved, once shaped, becomes vessels.\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThat which transcends form is called the Dao/Way;\nthat which is beneath form is called vessels.\nThere are forms and names to distinguish,\nand divisions to guard—\nthe Dao/Way is whole,\nHeaven and man merge as one;\nvessels are shaped,\nHeaven and man separate as two.\n\n**Explication:**\nThat which surpasses the Great Ultimate is the Dao/Way,\nso it is called that which transcends form.\nThat which remains within the square and round is vessels,\nso it is called that which is beneath form.\nThe Dao/Way and vessels\nhave forms that can be named,\nand divisions that can be guarded.\nSpeaking of the Dao/Way itself,\nthe Great Changes are yet undivided,\nand formless unity exists—\nthus it is whole,\nHeaven and man merge as one.\nSpeaking of vessels,\nthe Great Uncarved has already been shaped,\nhidden and revealed are divided—\nthus they are shaped,\nHeaven and man separate as two.\n\nThe Sage applies it,\nand thus becomes the ruler.\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe Dao’s wholeness, the Sage uses to govern himself.\nThe Dao’s shaping, the Sage uses to govern the world.\n\nThere are forms to be named,\nand divisions to be guarded—\nthus he assigns duties and leads subjects,\nand the world is ordered.\nThis is called the ruler.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*Know the subtle and the manifest,*\n*know the yielding and the firm.*\nThe expectations of ten thousand men,\nshare the same meaning.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe Dao’s truth is used to govern oneself—\nas it is said: *The Dao’s wholeness, the Sage uses to govern himself.*\nThe Dao’s practical applications are used to govern the world—\nas it is said: *The Dao’s shaping, the Sage uses to govern the world.*\n\nOnly by shaping the Dao to govern the world,\ndoes one who lifts and places have divisions and standards to guard;\nits forms are visible,\nand its names can be spoken.\nWith forms and names,\nits ability can be employed,\nand its materials can be entrusted.\nWith forms to be named,\nand divisions to be guarded—\nthus duties are assigned and subjects led,\nand the world is ordered.\n\nZhuangzi’s discourse on the great Dao/Way’s sequence\nsays that when virtue/power is clear,\nthen divisions and standards follow,\nand when divisions and standards are clear,\nthen forms and names follow—\ncontinuing to *necessarily divide its names,*\n*necessarily follow its names*—\nthis is called the utmost attainment of *Great Peace and order.*\nThe meaning aligns with this.\n\nThe Sage applies it,\nand thus becomes the ruler—\nthis is evident here.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* speaks of knowing the subtle and the manifest,\nknowing the yielding and the firm—\nits virtue/power is fully complete,\nvirtue and righteousness both attained,\nsufficient to be the expectations of ten thousand men—\nis this not the meaning of the ruler?\n\nThus, the great measures do not cut.\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nTransforming and adapting,\nlies in change—\ncarving myriad forms,\nyet not for craftiness.\n\n**Explication:**\nFollowing form and altering it is called transformation.\nSevering form abruptly is called change.\nFrom transformation to change,\nthis is the Dao’s sequence.\nThe Sage knows the Dao of transformation and change,\nand presages change—\nhe shapes things yet is not shaped by them,\nas *The Classic of Changes* says: *Transforming and adapting, lies in change.*\n\nThough he shapes things,\nhe does not distinguish them with rigid boundaries—\ncarving myriad forms,\nyet not for craftiness—\nthis is called *square yet not cutting.*\nIt is not that the great measures cannot reach this point.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: *The Way of the World’s Mastery***\nHe who would take the world and act upon it,\nI see him as one who cannot help but fail.\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe world is a great thing.\nHaving great things,\none cannot be a thing—\nbeing a thing yet not a thing,\nthus one can shape things.\nUnderstanding that the shaper of things is not a thing,\nand having no desire to take the world,\none can entrust the world to others.\n\nHe who would take the world and act upon it,\nuses wisdom and relies on strength—\nfar from attaining it.\nThus the Sage follows Dao/Way’s transformation,\nnot extolling wisdom and strength—\nQin failed through force,\nperhaps this is what is meant.\n\n**Explication:**\nAll that has appearance, sound, or color,\nare things.\nWhat is the distance between things and things?\nThough the world is vast,\nit can be called a great thing.\n\nYet without understanding the Dao/Way,\neven with great things,\none cannot shape things.\nOnly when one is unified with the Dao/Way,\nand not shaped by things,\ncan one govern all things,\ncommand the myriad movements,\nand shape the world’s things.\n\nIndeed, life is sustained by movement,\nnone can escape being shaped—\nthere must be one who is not constrained by things,\nyet can shape things.\nThe shaper of things is the Dao/Way.\nIf one understands that the Dao/Way is not a thing,\nthen the universe lies within his grasp,\nand he can entrust the world to others—\ncapable of bearing the world’s responsibility.\n\n「Zhuangzi speaks of the *great thing* (大物), which cannot be a *thing* (物). By *thinging* (物) it and thus concluding it, one may realize that the *thinger* (物物者) is not a *thing* (物). Is this Dao/Way merely for governing the world (治天下)? It is precisely this meaning.\n\nYet the world’s *great instruments* (大器) are not to be wielded—one cannot govern the world without understanding the Dao/Way. To seize the world and act upon it is to rely on *intelligence* (智) and *strength* (力). To rely on *intelligence* is to invite *constraint* (困), and to rely on *strength* is to invite *exhaustion* (殆). This is far from the Dao/Way.\n\nThus, the Sage *entrusts* (任) the Dao/Way to transform (化) and does not *exalt* (尚) *intelligence* or *strength*—for the Dao/Way transforms without being constrained by *things*, while *intelligence* and *strength* are themselves constrained by *things*.\n\nOnly by not being a *thing* can one *thing* all *things*—this is why the Sage *entrusts* the Dao/Way to transform and does not *exalt* *intelligence* or *strength*.\n\nThe *Qin* of *Ying* (嬴秦) merely *exalts* *intelligence* and *strength*—how could this suffice to govern the world? Therefore, the ancients said that *Qin* lost through its *forcefulness* (强). Yang Xiong called *Qin* a *wolf* (狼), and this too is because of this.\n\nThe world’s *divine instrument* (神器):\n**Huizong’s Annotation (徽宗注):** *Bound by form and number* (制於形数), *constrained by limits* (囿於方体), and *confined within the dual span of heaven and earth* (域於覆载之两问), this is what is called an *instrument* (器).\n*Established in the unfathomable* (立乎不测), *acting without fixed boundaries* (行乎无方), those who *wield* it fail, and those who *cling* to it lose. Hence, it is called the *divine instrument*.\n\n**Explication (疏义):** If one calls it the *Six Unities* (六合), then it is *bound by form and number*. If one calls it the *Universe* (宇宙), then it is *constrained by limits*. Though it spans the *dual realms of heaven and earth* (覆载之两间), it is not the *heaven and earth* themselves—thus, though vast, it is still an *instrument*.\n\nYet to *establish* it in the unfathomable without seeing its *advancement* (进), or to *act* without fixed boundaries yet never *encountering limits* (封), to *wield* it without knowing *non-action* (无为), then one must fail. To *cling* to it without knowing to *follow the times* (趋时), then one must lose. Though it has not departed from being an *instrument*, its *instrumentality* (为器) is indeed divine. Yet it cannot be *wielded*.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** To govern all *things* and command the myriad movements, there must be one who is not an *instrument*—only then can the world be governed. Hence it is said: *\"The Sage must practice non-action yet employ the world.\"*\n\n**Explication:** *Things* have *form*, then they can be named; they have *division*, then they can be guarded—this is what is called an *instrument*. There must be one who is not an *instrument*, only then can they *operate* their *instruments*.\n\nThe one who is not an *instrument* is the one who is not constrained by *things*—only by not being constrained by *things* can myriad *things* though numerous, and movements though diverse, all remain within the bounds of *prevention and guidance* (防范). Though they do not *intend* to govern and command, they naturally govern all *things* and command the myriad movements.\n\nAll who understand that the *thinger* (物物者) is not a *thing* (物) can thus achieve *non-action* (无为) yet fulfill the world’s tasks (功). Therefore, though they do not *govern* the world, the world is naturally governed.\n\nThe *Classic* says: *\"The Dao/Way is ever non-acting yet nothing it does not act upon. If rulers could guard this, all things would naturally transform.\"* Zhuangzi says: *\"The Sage must practice non-action yet employ the world.\"*\n\nThose who face south and rule the world, if they *cling to deeds* (事为) and their *traces* (迹), yet do not know to take *non-action* as constant, to *pursue the bounded* (有涯) while abandoning the *boundless* (元涯), then their *intelligence* will be constrained—how could they employ the world and transform all *things*?\n\nHence Zhuangzi says: *\"Excessive knowledge leads to defeat.\"* Those who *wield* meet with *defeat*.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** One who can *wield* yet cannot *non-act* will have their *intelligence* constrained.\n\nZhuangzi says: *\"Excessive knowledge leads to defeat.\"*\n\n**Explication:** To *enter* and *distinguish* with *things* is to differ; to *unify* is to practice *non-action*. To *exit* and *interact* with *things* is to *discriminate*—one cannot avoid *action*.\n\nIf one cannot avoid *action*, then they will inevitably encounter *opposition* (戾)—how could they avoid *defeat*?\n\nOnly by taking *non-action* as the *root* (本) and *action* as the *branches* (末), by *non-acting* yet *acting* without fail, can one *respond to things* with *abundance* (裕) and not *exhaust* their *intelligence*—who could be constrained?\n\nGuangchengzi says: *\"Excessive knowledge leads to defeat,\"* meaning that by *having no knowledge* (无知), one can *know nothing* (无不知)—what *defeat* is there?\n\nThose who *cling* will *lose*—\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** The Dao/Way’s most precious virtue is *timeliness* (时). To *cling* without transforming is to lose *timeliness*—this is called *contrary to the Dao*.\n\n**Explication:** *Timeliness* cannot be *stopped*, the Dao/Way cannot be *blocked*—*timeliness* shifts without pause, the Dao/Way adapts to change, hence the Dao/Way’s most precious virtue is *timeliness*.\n\n*Things* have no fixed *appropriateness* (宜)—*appropriateness* lies in *following the times*. If one *clings* without *losing*, if they are *stuck in one narrow view* (泥於一曲), then to *lose* is to *exceed*, and to *follow* is to *fall short*—how could they avoid *loss*?\n\nOnly by *transforming with the times* (与时俱化) and *having no fixed action* (无有专为) can one neither *lose timeliness* nor *contrary to the Dao*.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"The meaning of following the times is vast indeed.\"*\n\nHence, *things* either *move* (行) or *follow* (随), *inhale* (嘘) or *exhale* (吹), *strengthen* (强) or *weaken* (赢), *bear fruit* (载) or *wither* (隳).\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** The *principles* (理) of myriad *things*: some *move*, some *follow*—like the *eclipse* (往来) of sun and moon. Some *inhale*, some *exhale*—like the *cycles* (相代) of the four seasons. Some *strengthen*, some *weaken*—like the *ascendancy* (王) and *decline* (废) of the five phases. Some *bear fruit*, some *wither*—like the *growth* (开) and *fall* (落) of grasses and trees.\n\n*Serving the times* (役于时) yet *bound by numbers* (制于数), inevitably one cannot escape *burden*—only the Sage can avoid being burdened by *things* and stand alone above all *things*.\n\n*Going alone, coming alone*—this is called *having alone* (独有). The one who *has alone* is called the *most noble* (至贵).\n\nThus, *operating* the *divine instrument* leaves *abundance*—though *things* vary in their *states*, the Sage’s *heart* remains ever unified.\n\n**Explication:** When it is said to *go*, the moon comes; sun and moon alternate in their *illumination*—never ceasing, like the *principles* of *things* that either *move* or *follow*. Spring comes first, summer follows—seasons cycle without end, like the *principles* of *things* that either *inhale* or *exhale*.\n\nWhen wood *strengthens*, water *weakens*—when fire *arises*, metal is *bound*—like the *principles* of *things* that either *strengthen* or *weaken*, as in the *ascendancy* and *decline* of the five phases. When grain *dies*, wheat *grows*—when trees *fall*, the *millet* (鞠) *blossoms*—like the *principles* of *things* that either *bear fruit* or *wither*, as in the *growth* and *fall* of grasses and trees.\n\nFrom *moving* and *following* to *bearing fruit* and *withering*, all are *served by timeliness*—thus they *end with timeliness*, *bound by numbers*—thus they *exhaust with numbers*. This is why they *cycle endlessly* yet cannot escape *burden*.」\n\nThe Sage who transcends time and does not end with it,\nwho departs from numbers and does not exhaust with them—\nwhat burden could there be?\n\nThe Sage understands this:\nembodying the *Way*’s *non-being*, thus not burdened by *things*,\nembodying the *Way*’s *virtue*, thus standing alone above all *things*.\n\nThe *Way* within me—*things* cannot pair with it.\nThus, when moving, there is no cause to move,\nand so it is *solely moving*.\nThus, when coming, there is no source from which it comes,\nand so it is *solely coming*.\n\nWithout bestowal, yet ever spontaneous—\nthis may be called the utmost nobility.\n\nThe subtlety of *non-being* lies here—\nhow could the *doer* fail or the *grasper* lose?\n\nThus, the Sage wields the *spiritual instrument* with ease.\n\nThe Sage’s heart transcends *being* and *non-being*,\nunburdened by *things*—\nso when *things* shift and intertwine, my *principles* do not alter.\nThis is why, though *things* vary in form, the heart remains one.\n\nTherefore, the Sage rejects excess, rejects extravagance, rejects excessiveness.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe Sage perceives the transformations of all *things*,\nknows that fullness brings manifold burdens,\nand so does not augment life,\ndoes not indulge nature,\ndoes not reach extremes,\nbut plays within the *measure* alone.\n\nIf so, how could the *doer* be bound or the *grasper* err?\n\nThus it is said:\nElaborate rituals and superficial adornments bring no benefit to governance.\n\n**Explanatory Notes:**\n*Things* flourish then decay—\nthus there is change.\nFullness invites loss—\nthus there are burdens.\n\nThe Sage knows that *moving* and *following*,\n*inhale* and *exhale*,\n*strengthen* and *weaken*,\n*bear fruit* and *wither*—\nthese cycles do not cease.\nThus, perceiving the transformations of all *things*,\nknowing the burdens of fullness,\nthe Sage follows their spontaneity without augmentation,\ntakes *moderation* as standard without excess,\npreserves internally and externally without sway,\nand does not indulge nature—\nthis is called *playing within the measure*.\n\nTo *play within the measure* is to walk in the *Unnamed*.\nThe *Unnamed*—this is the *Way*.\nTo walk in the *Way*—\nhow could there be the afflictions of excess or extravagance?\n\nGuarding the source of nature,\nharmonizing with the *Way* in its turns,\ngoverning the world—\nembodying *non-action*,\nthus no failure in *non-action*,\naligning with the utmost transformation,\nthus no loss in *grasping*—\n\nThose who indulge in elaborate rituals and superficial adornments\nare yet burdened by the afflictions of excess and extravagance—\nhow could they benefit governance?\n\n**End of *Explanations on the Dao De Jing*, Volume Six**\n**End of *Explanations on the Dao De Jing*, Volume Seven**\n\n**Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* by Jiang Cheng, Student of the Imperial Academy**\n**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Sovereign with the Dao**\n\nTo assist the sovereign with the Dao is to **not** subdue the world with arms.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe deployment of the three armies and five weapons is the *end* of virtue.\nThe *end* refers to what ancient sages possessed but did not prioritize.\n\nTo assist the sovereign with the Dao is to focus on the *root* alone, hence one does not subdue the world with arms.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nZhuangzi spoke of five *ends* in governance, and the deployment of the three armies and five weapons is the *end* of virtue. The *root* is the cultivation of spirit, heart, and method.\n\nArms cannot be abandoned, yet the five *ends* were possessed by the ancients.\nThe virtuous focus on the *root*, thus they did not prioritize them. To assist the sovereign with the Dao is to excel as a virtuous one—how could one drive the people to the brink of death and life, using coercion to subdue the world?\n\nIn days past, King Hui of Liang wished to avenge his humiliation by offering a single cup of wine to the dead of Chu. Mencius taught him that the virtuous have no rival—yet this was not by subduing the world with arms. This is the principle of *good returns*.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThis is what Mencius meant by *\"return unto yourself.\"*\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nIf one acts with goodness, others will respond in kind. If one acts with harm, others will respond likewise. This is the law of *return unto oneself*. If one takes delight in warfare and killing, what manner of retribution will they receive? Hence, *good returns*.\n\nWhere the teacher treads, brambles grow.\nAfter great armies, famine follows.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe lower ranks are drained of strength, hence brambles grow.\nThe ruler defies the natural order, hence there are years of scarcity.\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"To pacify the myriad states,\nAnd reap abundant harvests.\"*\n\nTo pacify the myriad states is to bring harmony to the people.\nWhen the people are harmonious, the harmony of Heaven and Earth responds in kind.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nPlowing without recklessness, weeding without destruction—this is the exertion of human effort.\nSnow falls abundantly, rain nourishes the roots—this is the favor of Heaven’s timing.\nWarfare is not the means to strengthen the land’s power.\nTo the point of draining the people’s strength, hence brambles grow.\nWarfare is not the means to summon harmonious *qi*.\nTo the point of defying Heaven’s timing, hence there are years of scarcity.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"To pacify the myriad states,\nAnd reap abundant harvests.\"*\n\nTo pacify the myriad states is to bring harmony to the people.\nWhen the people are in harmony, they align with Heaven and Earth in one *qi*—\nthus, when the people are harmonious, the harmony of Heaven and Earth responds.\n\nThis is a martial poem, differing from Laozi’s teachings,\nto illustrate how the Sage’s intent surpasses the martial ambitions of men.\nThus, the good seek fulfillment alone,\nand dare not claim strength through conquest.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nTo seek what is right in action, to achieve completion in deeds,\nto expend little effort yet see great results—\nthis is the Dao of the Sage.\nTo conquer through force is the mark of a cruel virtue,\nhence victory in war lies in harmony, not in numbers.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nThough undertakings differ, all seek what is right.\nThough achievements differ, all seek completion.\n\nYet there are those who labor tirelessly yet see few results—\nthey do not grasp the root and the essential.\n\nThe Sage’s Dao is the foundation of the world,\nand the key to governance lies here.\nThus, though effort is little, results are great.\n\nAs for displaying martial might and conquering by force,\nhow can this be deemed a virtuous path?\n\nThe ancient kings had ways of constant victory,\nyet some turned left and right in retreat,\ntheir campaigns failing without success—\nthey did not understand the Sage’s Dao.\n\nThe Sage’s Dao lies in harmonizing the people,\nuniting their hearts and efforts,\nso that no task is impossible,\nno achievement unfulfilled,\nand they stand unchallenged under Heaven—\nas Leftist Master said: *\"Victory lies in harmony, not in numbers.\"*\n\nMencius said: *\"Geographical advantage is not as vital as the unity of the people.\"*\nGou Qing said: *\"If the people and officers are not united,\neven the likes of Tang and Wu could not triumph.\"*\n\nThus, true victory lies in harmony, not in numbers.\n\nWhen success is achieved, do not boast,\ndo not claim glory,\ndo not grow arrogant,\ndo not act out of compulsion,\nand do not force outcomes.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nAmong those who act only when compelled,\nthe Sage’s Dao ensures victory through moderation and righteousness,\nwithout blame—\nsuccess is sought, and that is all.\n\nBoasting invites decline,\nself-praise yields no merit,\narrogance invites contempt.\nThese four pitfalls must be avoided\nto achieve success without coercion.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nThe Sage deliberates before acting,\nand when success is attained,\nit is as if responding to the Mandate of Heaven—\nhow could this be otherwise?\nMuch less so in war.\n\nVictory through moderation brings good fortune,\nrighteousness brings no blame—\nlike the *Hexagram Nine-Two* of the *Yijing*.\nTo act in accordance with the natural order,\nto move cautiously yet decisively,\nto hunt like a skilled archer—\nthis is *\"victory through moderation.\"*\n\nTo be yielding yet upright,\nto guide the many with righteousness,\nto speak with conviction without blame—\nthis is *\"righteousness without blame.\"*\n\nYet the Sage does not wage war recklessly,\nnor indulge in unquenchable martial ambition.\nWhen compelled, resistance arises—\nbut self-boasting brings no growth,\nself-praise yields no true merit,\narrogance invites disdain.\nHow could this be the way of the virtuous victor?\n\nFor killing the enemy is but one aspect of success—\nif one achieves it without arrogance,\nnone dare contest their might.\nIf one achieves it without claiming glory,\nnone dare dispute their deeds.\nIf one achieves it without arrogance,\ntheir victory endures unchallenged.\nThus, their achievements stand unrivaled in the world.\n\n**On the decline of strength:**\n*\"Things flourish and then decay.\"*\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe cycles of growth and decline are evident in summer’s length and autumn’s withering.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nWhere there is spring’s nourishment and summer’s growth,\nthere must be autumn’s austerity and winter’s death—\nthe Great Transformation moves subtly.\nWho can perceive its workings?\n*\"Things flourish and then decay\"*—\nthis is plain to see.\n\nThis is called *\"not the Dao.\"*\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe Dao has no beginning or end,\nand does not align with the transformations of things.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nIts beginning has no origin—\nwho can trace its source?\nIts end has no conclusion—\nwho can define its limit?\nFrom antiquity, it has always existed,\nyet it transcends all transformations.\nThus, the Dao does not conform to the changes of things.\nThe Dao and things are fundamentally apart—\nhence, *\"things flourish and then decay\"* is called *\"not the Dao.\"*\n\n*\"Not the Dao\"* is early decline.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nTo exist outside the Dao is to invite the contrast of flourishing and decay.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nBound within the Great Transformation,\nrigidity becomes strength,\ndecay becomes weakness—\nall things follow this pattern,\nfor they exist outside the Dao.\nThe Dao, enduring from ancient times,\nknows no decay or vigor—\nhow could it follow such cycles?\n\n---\n**On martial prowess (Chapter Thirty-One):**\n*\"Fine weapons are ominous instruments—*\nthings naturally abhor them,\nso those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\"*\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nAuspicious events bring omens,\nbut weapons are instruments of misfortune—\nhence, *\"ominous.\"*\nWeapons are stored yet used in due measure,\nand those who follow the Dao display virtue rather than martial might—\nthus, they do not dwell upon them.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nAll phenomena arise from some origin,\nand auspicious signs precede blessings—\nthis is the natural order.\nWhen blessings manifest in things, they are called *\"omens.\"*\nThus, the *Yijing* states that auspicious events bring omens.\nBut weapons are instruments of misfortune—\nwhat auspicious sign could precede them?\nHence, they are *\"ominous.\"*\n\nStill, reckless warfare is akin to sacrilege,\nand though the ancient kings did not abandon it,\nthose who conceal their virtue do not flaunt their might,\nand those who wage war without restraint leave no legacy—\nthus, they do not display their armies.\n\nAs the *Commentaries* say: *\"Weapons are stored yet used in due measure\"*—\nthis refers to such conduct.\n\nKing Wu stored his arms and discarded his bows,\nseeking virtuous governance to restore the Xia—\nthis was displaying virtue without martial show.\n\nMoreover, martial prowess is a hidden virtue,\nconcealed like a crown or a wrapped foot—\nit is advanced like a footstep, yet unused.\nThus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it.\n\nHence, the gentleman values the left in peace,\nbut the right in war.\n\nWeapons are ominous instruments,\nnot the tools of the gentleman.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe left embodies *yang*—generative, life-affirming—\nthe right embodies *yin*—destructive, punitive.\n*Yang* is virtue, *yin* is punishment—\nthe gentleman honors virtue and fears punishment,\nthus weapons are *\"not the gentleman’s instrument.\"*\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nThe Great Dao is vast and unbounded,\nyet it has left and right—\nthus, the left is *yang*, the right is *yin*.\n*Yin* and *yang* are the origins of life and death—\n*yang* governs life, *yin* governs death.\nVirtue governs life, hence Guanzi says *yang* is virtue,\npunishment governs death, hence Guanzi says *yin* is punishment.\nWhen virtue is complete, it ascends—\nnothing can diminish it,\nthus the gentleman values virtue.\nWhen punishment is to be applied,\nmusic is silenced—\nthus the gentleman fears punishment.\nHence, ominous instruments are not the gentleman’s tools.\nThey are used only when compelled,\nwith calm resolve as the highest virtue.\n\nThus, it is not beautiful—\nif it were beautiful, one would delight in it,\nand delighting in it would mean delighting in killing people.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nTo suppress tyranny and quell chaos,\none acts only when forced—\nthus, it is unavoidable.\nWithout the intent to conquer others,\nit is said that *tranquility and composure* are supreme.\n\nWithout the intent to conquer others,\nwarfare is not something to delight in,\nthus it is not beautiful.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nWarfare is an ominous instrument—\neven the sage avoids it,\nyet when the sage responds to the world\nto secure the people,\nthe tyrannical cannot but be suppressed,\nand when chaos arises,\nit cannot but be quelled.\nWhen the barbarian armies come to provoke divine retribution,\nwarfare is mobilized at the proper time—\none cannot but go.\nThe deployment of the three armies and five weapons\nis the lowest extension of virtue.\nThe sage employs them—\nhow could this be his original intent?\nIt is merely because there is no alternative.\n\nThus, he habitually dwells in the realm of non-contention,\nyet does not dare to act first for the world—\nhow could he take conquest as his heart’s desire?\nIt is because *tranquility and composure* are held supreme.\nThose who delight in killing people\nshall never find fulfillment in the world.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nWhen the ruler cherishes *ren* (benevolence),\nthe world has no rival.\nTo secure what is perilous and profit from what is harmful,\nto delight in what leads to ruin—\nthis is where resentment gathers\nand where calamity converges.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nThe benevolent have no rivals,\nthus when the ruler cherishes *ren*,\nthe world has no rival.\nIf this is not understood,\nthen when drums clash and soldiers leap into battle,\nit is as if one secures what is perilous without fear,\nprofits from what is harmful without caution,\nand delights in what leads to ruin without shame—\nhow could this not invite resentment\nand summon calamity?\n\nHow could one know that the ruler’s warfare\nis rooted in *ren* and *yi* (righteousness),\nexecuted through punishment and retribution,\nused only when necessary,\nand abandoned when peace returns—\nas a means to ensure enduring stability?\n\nFor auspicious matters, the left is honored;\nfor inauspicious matters, the right is honored.\nThus, the *Pianjiangjun* (Vanguard General) is stationed on the left,\nand the *Shangjiangjun* (Commander-in-Chief) on the right.\nWhen occupying a position of dominance,\none observes funeral rites.\nWhen many are slain,\none mourns them with sorrowful weeping.\nWhen victorious in battle,\none observes funeral rites.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe *Yijing* calls warfare *\"poison for the world\"*—\neven if victorious, there will be those afflicted by its effects,\nthus those in dominant positions and the victorious\nare treated with funeral rites.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nIn the *Yijing*’s *\"Warfare\"* hexagram:\n*\"With this, you poison the world,\nyet the people follow you.\"*\nThe ruler’s warfare is meant to shelter the people and gather forces—\nthough victorious, it is like a physician gathering poisonous medicines to attack illness,\nand there will inevitably be those harmed by its effects.\nThus, the *Yijing* calls warfare *\"poison for the world,\"*\nand those in dominant positions and the victorious\nare treated with funeral rites.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao Ever Nameless**\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao Ever Nameless**\n\n---\n\nThe *Dao* is the origin of heaven and earth—how could it be named?\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe *Dao* is the origin of heaven and earth—how could it be named?\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nThe unnameable is the origin of heaven and earth.\nThe *Dao* is that which gives birth to heaven and earth—\nthus it cannot be named.\nThough *pu* (crude simplicity) is small,\nnothing under heaven can subdue it.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\n*Pu* (crude simplicity) is used to illustrate the complete *Dao*.\nWhen the *Dao* manifests as form and name, the great prevails over the small.\nThe complete *Dao* does not depart from its essence—\nsmall yet discerning, as Zhuangzi said:\n*\"Within it, the True Lord abides.\"*\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"In harmony with desirelessness, this is called *sùpǔ* (unadulterated simplicity).\"*\nThe *Classic* states:\n*\"When *pu* (crude simplicity) disperses, it becomes *qì* (vessels).\"*\n*Pu* illustrates the complete *Dao*—\nthe great lies above, few yet overcoming all things;\nthe small lies below, many yet overcome by things.\nOnly when the *Dao* manifests as form and name does it appear thus.\nYet the complete *Dao* itself does not establish any single thing—\nit cannot be grasped, thus it is called *wēi* (subtle).\nIn perfect unity with essence, it returns to the most profound,\nand can be named only as *xiǎo* (small).\nThis *Dao* does not cling to form,\nnor is it confined to number.\nThe True Lord is sufficient to tower above the world—\nnot like those bound by square forms and burdened by size,\nthus nothing under heaven dares to subdue it.\n\nIf rulers and kings could uphold it,\nall things would naturally submit as guests.\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nWhen the *Dao* suffices as the master of all things,\nall things will naturally submit as guests.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"In unadulterated simplicity, the people’s nature is attained.\"*\nTo govern all things without reliance on coercion or punishment,\nthis is the *Dao*’s limit.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nThe *Analects* say:\n*\"Why should not all follow this *Dao*?\"*\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"That which moves among all things is the *Dao*.\"*\nThe *Dao* is like the root of all things,\nand all things reverence the *Dao*.\nIf one can uphold the *Dao*,\nthen all things submit as guests.\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"In unadulterated simplicity, the people’s nature is attained.\"*\n*Pu* is the complete *Dao*—\nto embody the *Dao* is to attain the people’s nature,\nand its meaning aligns precisely with this.\n\nIn the *Yijing*, it is said:\n*\"The sages observe the *shén* (mysterious/numenous) *Dao* in setting their teachings,\nand all under heaven submit.\"*\nThen, if one can govern all things,\nwhat need is there for coercion or punishment?\n\nHeaven and earth unite,\nand sweet dew descends—\nno one commands it,\nyet all is balanced.\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe pure and simple *Dao*,\nif upheld without loss,\nis not merely that all things submit as guests—\nit reaches to the heavens above,\nand coils around the earth below.\nWhen the upper and lower flow in harmony with heaven and earth,\nthen the *Dao*’s circulation brings unity,\nand all things share its beneficence.\nSweet dew is the *héqi* (harmonious *qi*) of heaven and earth.\n\nThe *Commentary* says:\n*\"The virtue of the emperor and king\nreaches to *Tàiqīng* (Supreme Clarity),\ndescends to *Tàiníng* (Supreme Tranquility),\nand embraces all living things—\nthen sweet dew descends.\"*\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nPure means no loss of its spirit,\nsimple means no admixture with other things.\nThe pure and simple *Dao* guards only the spirit—\nif one can uphold it without loss,\nthen it merges with the spirit,\nand the unity of its precision\nharmonizes with the natural order of heaven.\nHow could it merely submit things?\nTo unite with heaven above,\nthen the upper merges with the *yuánhuà* (primordial transformation);\nto descend with earth below,\nthen the lower embraces *hòudé* (profound virtue).\nSpirit pervades the four directions—\nabove, it reaches to heaven;\nbelow, it coils around earth.\nWhen it flows in harmony with heaven and earth,\nthen the two unite in accord,\nand sweet dew descends.\nWhich thing could fail to share in its beneficence?\n\nThe *Húguānzǐ* says:\n*\"The virtue of the emperor and king\nreaches to *Tàiqīng* (Supreme Clarity),\ndescends to *Tàiníng* (Supreme Tranquility),\nand embraces all living things—\nthen sweet dew descends.\"*\n\nHeaven’s tranquility is *wúwéi* (non-action),\nthus it is called *Tàiqīng* (Supreme Clarity).\nTo reach *Tàiqīng* is to unite with heaven above.\nEarth’s tranquility is *wúwéi* (non-action),\nthus it is called *Tàiníng* (Supreme Tranquility).\nTo descend to *Tàiníng* is to coil with earth below.\nOnly humans are the living souls of all things—\nto embrace *wànlíng* (all living things) is to encompass all things,\nthus sweet dew descends.\n\nAt first, there was no naming—\nonce naming was established,\none must also know when to stop.\nTo know when to stop is to avoid peril.\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe sequence of the Great *Dao*:\nfive transformations until form and name can be raised.\nWhen form is raised and named,\nthe *Dao* descends and virtue decays—\nthe pure is diluted, *pu* (crude simplicity) is dispersed,\nand none can halt it.\n\nThe benevolent of the world\ncast their eyes downward and grieve over the world’s exhaustion,\nwhile the unvirtuous\nprioritize life and death’s desires\nand glut themselves on wealth and honor.\nThe sage is not thus.\nWhen naming first arises,\nhe stands alone, his form unyielding—\nhow could he follow things in their transformations?\nSerene and self-sufficient, dwelling with spirit and clarity—\nhow could this not suffice as rest?\nRather, he halts it,\nand firmly grasps it.\nTo halt within flow is to move while remaining true—\nif so, who could endanger him?\n\nThe reason why it is not in peril thus.\n\nCompare the *Dao* in the world\nto the streams and valleys uniting with the rivers and seas.\n\n*Xuanzong* annotated: \"The world, a single nature.\nThe *Dao* in the world, harmonizing through nature,\nis like the streams and valleys uniting with the rivers and seas—\ngathered by water, those alike are nourished,\nthose of kindred nature respond.\nWhen the sage governs with this,\nwhat need is there for action?\nIt is merely to follow nature.\"\n\n*Shuyi* elaborated: \"Life differs in form, yet all

nature respond—\nwhen the sage governs,\nresting with hands folded,\nthe world is in harmony.\nWhat need is there for action?\nIt is merely to transform the people\nby following their nature.\"\n\nKnowing people is wisdom—*Zhizhe* (Knowing People) Chapter 33.\n\n「Huizong’s annotation states: The *Commentary* says, “Wisdom is like the eye—able to see a hundred paces away, yet unable to see its own eyelashes.” To discern the deceitful or upright in others, as one distinguishes white from black, is the work of wisdom—knowing people is all.\n\n*Shuyi* further expounds: “Gazing upon the minute hairs of a moth in autumn, these are the most subtle of things; even at a distance of a hundred paces, a keen-eyed observer can still perceive them. Yet the eyelashes of a man are close at hand—even if one were to summon the legendary *Zhujia* (離朱, \"the far-seeing\") to squint and scrutinize them in broad daylight, he would not see them. So too is human wisdom: one can discern others, yet cannot truly know oneself. This is what *Han Fei* records of *Duzi* (杜子, \"Master Du\")—that wisdom is like the eye, able to see a hundred paces away, yet unable to see its own eyelashes.\n\n*Mengzi* (Mencius) says: The faculty of distinguishing right from wrong is the beginning of wisdom.\n*Zuozi* (苟子, \"Master Zuo\") says: To affirm what is right and deny what is wrong is what we call wisdom. To discern the deceitful or upright in others, as one distinguishes white from black, is to affirm what is right and deny what is wrong. Thus, wisdom as the eye can see what is external yet cannot self-examine—it can only know others.\n\nBut self-knowledge is clarity.\n\nHuizong’s annotation states: The *Yijing* (易經, *Classic of Changes*) says, “To recover is to know oneself.” The *Commentary* says: “To inwardly gaze is what we call clarity.” Wisdom, in knowing others, becomes entangled in interaction—this is called *xinzhou* (心鬥, \"mental contention\"), or using one’s mind to vie with others. Yet to recover and know oneself is to remain still and return to the root—seeing oneself is all. It is the balance of heaven and earth, the illumination of all things.\n\n*Shuyi* further expounds: To recover the subtle and discern in things, to return to the root and be still—stillness brings clarity, and there is nothing it does not penetrate. Hence, the *Yijing* says, “To recover is to know oneself.” To inwardly gaze is to see without attachment, to see others yet truly see oneself—thus, the *Commentary* says, “To inwardly gaze is what we call clarity.”\n\nTo employ wisdom in discerning the deceitful or upright in others is to uphold what is right and reject what is wrong, to look around and have all things respond—this is to engage in *xinzhou*, using an empty, unified, and tranquil mind to daily judge. The rectification of right and wrong is thus the work of knowing others, no more.\n\nBut to recover and know oneself is to inwardly observe the single nature, to remain still and return to the root, to see what others do not see and to perceive the unseen forms—thus attaining what is called *jianjian* (見見, \"true seeing\"). Is there anything greater than this in heaven and earth? To see is to attain its balance.\n\nThe myriad things are vast—is there anything greater than this? **Form** is their illumination.\n\nIf such is the case, then what we call *clarity* truly attains completion? Those who excel over others possess *power*, but those who conquer themselves are *strong*.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The Sage values virtue/power over force, striving to conquer oneself rather than others.\"* The wise deceive the foolish, the brave endure the cowardly—this is excelling over others, relying on *power* alone. To conquer one’s own selfishness, maintaining rectitude without injury—this is conquering oneself. When one goes forth, standing alone without fear; when dwelling, retreating from the world without discontent—never venturing forth without triumph, this is the source of *strength*.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"The foolish cannot be trusted with schemes, so the wise employ their discernment to deceive them. The cowardly cannot stand against adversity, so the brave summon their vigor to endure them—this is the valuing of force to triumph over others. To conquer one’s selfishness with a resolute mind, nurturing non-harm and preserving one’s *qi*—this is the valuing of virtue/power to conquer oneself. Only by conquering oneself does one remain unshaken when external things press upon them, unable to destroy one’s true being. Thus, going forth, one stands alone without fear; dwelling, one retreats from the world without discontent. To stand alone yet fear nothing is to be brave in *righteousness*. To retreat from the world yet feel no discontent is to find peace in *fate*. Whether one goes forth or dwells, never venturing without triumph—this is why they are called *ultimately strong*.\"*\n\nThose who know sufficiency are rich. The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"To possess myriad differences is what we call richness.\"* The *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"The myriad transformations of existence bear distinct names, yet they do not lose their essence—this is ultimate richness, where the measure of sufficiency resides in one’s self. As Zhuangzi said: 'To possess myriad differences is what we call richness.' Only those who know sufficiency roam within the *boundaries* (of the body), finding sufficiency in themselves. Thus, their head is round, their feet square, and heaven and earth take their place; their chest faces south, their back north, and yin and yang are fully embraced. All things have their limits, yet all are complete—what riches of Jin and Chu could compare? The sufficiency of those who know sufficiency is everlasting, hence the treasures of the realm gather within them.\"*\n\nThose who act with *strength* possess *will*.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"To persist in self-strengthening is to uphold *will* in the Dao/Way.\"* The *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"To exert oneself in study and inquiry broadens one’s knowledge and sharpens wisdom; to exert oneself in practicing the Dao/Way awakens virtue/power and yields great achievements. Thus, those who strive in action rely on self-strengthening, and self-strengthening is what we call having *will*. The *Daoist Classic on Virtue/Power* says: 'The Superior Sage hears the Dao/Way and moves to act upon it.' Truly, those who uphold *will* in the Dao/Way—hearing the Dao/Way and moving to act—accumulate true strength over time, persisting in self-strengthening without end. Could this be done by those without *will*? Those who do not lose their place endure long; those who conform to time and shift with things can only last temporarily. The *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"If one can embody the eternal without change, steadfast in what they guard, they can then let the Dao/Way unfold in action, enduring boundlessly. In the *Book of Changes*, the *Commentary* speaks of the Sage standing firm without shifting direction, and the *Symbol* says: 'The Sage endures long in their Dao/Way.' This is precisely what is meant. If one is confined by time and shifts with things, how could they not lose their place? The aged and the young transform, and one shifts with them—could they truly not lose their place?\"*\n\nThose who die yet do not perish are *long-lived*.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Life has its root in growth, death has its return in origin; tracing the beginning and returning to the end, one understands the teachings of death and life.\"* The *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"The Sage comprehends the Dao/Way of day and night, knowing that death is not fundamentally different from life. Thus, their form dissolves, yet their spirit does not perish, enduring alongside heaven and earth without known limit—what else could be called *long-lived*? This chapter’s meaning begins with knowing others to exhaust principles, proceeds to knowing sufficiency to fulfill nature, and concludes with not perishing to attain *fate*—thus, creation dwells within us. Who but those without past or future, entering the realm of neither death nor life, could attain this? The *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"All things: life emerges from the One, death returns to the One. Life has its root in growth, death has its end in return. To trace the beginning and know the teachings of death—like Zhuangzi’s words: 'Mingled between the coarse and the fine, it transforms and gives rise to *qi*; *qi* transforms and gives rise to form, now again transforming into death.' To return to the end and know the teachings of life—like Zhuangzi’s words: 'How do I know that the dead do not regret their life? Perhaps their joy lies in the firewood’s first sprouting.' Beginning and end oppose the boundless, yet no one knows where they end—how could death and life be fundamentally different? It is merely the One, threading through all. Day and night alternate, dividing into darkness and light, and all things flow in the space between heaven and earth, serving the cycles of day and night. Day and night succeed one another, just as life and death replace each other. Those confined by time and shifting with things are destined to be overtaken by the bounds of day and night. Only the enlightened know that all is One, that death and life are but a single thread. Though they come and go with things, there is what we call 'not coming,' though they move with things, there is what we call 'not moving.' Knowing that death is not fundamentally different from life, their form undergoes myriad changes, dissolving with time, yet their true nature remains serene, their spirit unperishing. Thus, comprehending the Dao/Way of day and night, they know their independence—this is the ultimate One. Heaven endures long, earth persists forever, and together they endure without limit. Their *long-lived* nature knows no bounds.\"*\n\nThis chapter’s meaning begins with knowing others to exhaust principles, proceeds to knowing sufficiency to fulfill nature, and concludes with not perishing to attain *fate*—thus, creation dwells within us.\n\nThus, exhausting principles reveals no obstruction—hence, knowing others is to exhaust principles;\nfulfilling nature leaves no desire—hence, knowing sufficiency is to fulfill nature;\nrealizing the essence of *fate* governs all things without constraint—hence, death without perishing is to attain *fate*.\n\nThe *Yijing* speaks of exhausting principles, fulfilling nature, and attaining *fate*—its sequence aligns with this chapter’s meaning.\n\nWhen one attains *fate*, the marvels of creation arise from within oneself.\nMorning clarity reveals solitude, merging in obscurity with the Dao,\ntranscending time’s measure, beyond the bounds of past and future,\nfree from form and body, untouched by life and death’s dominion.\n\nZhuangzi spoke of neither ancient nor modern, entering the realm of neither death nor life—this is what is meant.\n\n---\n**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows**\n\nThe Great Dao flows—it may turn left or right.\n*Huizong’s Annotation*: Flowing without attachment, it neither loses motion nor stillness, nor exhausts coming and going—left or right, it knows no impossibility.\n\n*Exegesis*: The interplay of yin and yang is the Dao—left is yang, right is yin. Thus, flowing without attachment, it may turn left or right.\n\n*The Taixuan* says: \"Without attachment is the sage.\"\nZhuangzi says: \"There is left and right, yet no attachment.\"\n\nThus, it does not cling to one side, yet left and right exist.\nIf so, motion and stillness lie within—like yin and yang’s ebb and flow in filling and emptying, what loss can there be?\nThen motion and stillness are unerring.\n\nComing and going lie within—like the moon’s successive illumination creating day and night, what exhaustion can there be?\nThen coming and going are boundless.\n\nTake from the left, and it is left; take from the right, and it is right—\nno gate, no side, four-way expansive, yet all reach their source.\nHow can it be stored and not attained?\n\nAll things rely upon it to live, yet it does not refuse.\nIts work done, it does not dwell upon it.\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation*: It gives to those who depart, supplies those who seek—\nall things form and transform themselves, wise and strong in their own right,\nyet it does not claim their merit.\nLike the four seasons: when one departs, another takes its place.\nWood thrives as water wanes—its work done, it departs.\nWho would claim it as their own?\n\n*Exegesis*: It gives to those who depart—\nas Zhuangzi said, \"All things depart, yet it supplies them without depletion.\"\nIt supplies those who seek—\nas Zhuangzi said, \"The utmost void fulfills all seeking.\"\nSince it gives to those who depart and supplies those who seek,\nyet remains untangled, life and transformation, wisdom and strength\nare all entrusted to their own nature—\nwhy claim their merit?\nLike the four seasons: when *wu* emerges, *ding* retreats;\nwood flourishes as water declines—\nits work done, it departs.\nWho would acknowledge it as their own?\n\nIt clothes all things yet is not their master—\nthus, it is ever without desire, worthy of being called *small*.\nAll things return to it, yet it knows no master—\nworthy of being called *great*.\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation*: The Dao, in its utmost obscurity, is *small* yet distinct from things;\nin its utmost transformation, it is *great* yet interacts with things.\nDistinct from things, it is ever without desire;\ninteracting with things, all things return to it.\nIt covers and reveals all things yet does not display its sovereign power—\nthus, it is not their master.\nIt stirs and guides the multitude yet no one discerns its path—\nthus, it knows no master.\n\nThe Dao is not *small* or *great*—what is called *small* or *great*\nare but its manifestations in things.\n\n*Exegesis*: Its essence penetrates the spirit—*small* in its obscurity,\nits radiance shines forth—*great* in its transformation.\nThus, in its utmost obscurity, it is *small* and distinct from things;\nin its utmost transformation, it is *great* and interacts with things.\nThe Heavenly Dao ascends to the north—its time of retreat;\ndescends to the south—its time of departure.\nSouthward interaction, northward distinction—\nthus, the Dao in its utmost obscurity is *small* and distinct from things,\nin its utmost transformation is *great* and interacts with things.\nDistinct from things, self and objects are forgotten—\nthus, it is ever without desire.\nInteracting with things, it yields and adapts—\nthus, all things return to it.\nIt covers and reveals all things yet does not display its sovereign power—\nthus, it is not their master (from its inherent nature).\nIt stirs and guides the multitude yet no one discerns its path—\nthus, it knows no master (from its outward manifestation).\n\nMoreover, the Dao covers and carves all things,\nyet does not boast of its craft—\nthus, in covering all things, it does not display its sovereign power.\nOnly by not displaying its power does it not claim mastery.\nIt stirs and guides to exhaust the spirit—\nthus, in stirring the multitude, no one discerns its path.\nOnly by not revealing its traces does it remain unknown as master.\n\nThe Dao is neither *small* nor *great*—\nwhat is called *small* or *great* is not its true constancy,\nbut its manifestations in things.\nWhen it manifests in things, it is no longer the Dao beyond form.\nThus, the sage never claims *greatness*—\nonly then can they achieve true *greatness*.\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation*: Their deeds cover the world yet seem not their own—\nthus, their achievements are vast and abundant.\nMencius said: \"To transform the great is to be sage.\"\nTo transform the great is to not be burdened by *greatness*—\nthus, they achieve true *greatness*.\n\n*Exegesis*: With solid substance and radiance, this is *great*.\n*Great* not yet detached from form—\nform’s *greatness* cannot transform without flaw.\nOnly through ceaseless change does it attain the name *sage*,\nfree from the burden of *greatness*.\nFree from the burden of *greatness*, it does not cling to *greatness*—\nthus, it achieves true *greatness*.\n\n---\n**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Symbol**\n\n**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Symbol**\n\nHolding the Great Symbol, all under Heaven comes.\n*Huizong’s Annotation*: The Symbol is like the heavens in its manifestation—\nwithout action, yet moving by fixed rhythms;\nwithout speech, yet revealing through patterns.\nThe sage governs the world by resting in non-action,\nby walking the silent instruction,\nand the people turn to them as to parents—\nthus it is said: *Holding the Great Symbol, all under Heaven comes*.\n\n*Exegesis*: The heavens manifest the Symbol,\nand the sage follows its lead.\nThe heavens’ manifestation is smooth yet without stagnation,\ncirculating endlessly without pause—\nits movement is vigorous and unflagging.\nWhat need does it have for action?\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"Non-action as its action is the heaven’s way.\"*\n*The Book of Changes* says: *\"The heaven’s movement is vigorous.\"*\nThis is non-action yet moving by vigor.\n\nThe stars revolve, the clouds and rainbows appear and vanish—\nits patterns are visible,\nyet how does the heaven speak?\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"The heaven and earth have great virtue yet do not speak.\"*\n*The Book of Changes* says: *\"Gazing upward to observe the heaven’s patterns.\"*\nThis is speechless yet revealing through patterns.\n\nThe sage’s governance of the world embodies the heaven’s transformations,\ngrasping the Great Symbol to show the people—\nlike the heaven’s manifestation,\nresting in non-action,\nthough acting yet never crossing the boundary of non-action;\nwalking silent instruction,\nthough teaching yet never uttering the intent of speech.\n\nThus, the people’s turning to them\nis like water flowing downward—\ntheir love is as close as parents,\ntheir attachment unbreakable as glue and lacquer.\nHence it is said: *Holding the Great Symbol, all under Heaven comes*.\n\nAs for the Great Symbol,\nit is seen yet cannot be grasped—\nthe *Classics* say: *\"The Great Symbol is formless.\"*\n\nAll come yet none are harmed.\n*Huizong’s Annotation*: When yin and yang are harmonious and tranquil,\nspirits and gods do not disturb,\nall living things are uninjured,\nten thousand things flourish without withering,\nand though the people may have knowledge,\nthey lack use for it—\nwhat harm could there be?\n\n*Exegesis*: The sage regulates heaven and earth through yin and yang,\nthus yin and yang are harmonious and tranquil—\nas *Liezi* says: *\"Yin and yang constantly adjust.\"*\nBy the Dao they move all under Heaven,\nthus spirits and gods do not disturb—\nas *Liezi* says: *\"The spirits have no response.\"*\nThey fulfill the needs of all living things,\nand all living things cling to their homeland—\nthus all living things are uninjured—\nas *Liezi* says: *\"Humans suffer no untimely evil.\"*\nThey nurture all ten thousand things,\nand all ten thousand things find their proper place—\nthus ten thousand things do not wither—\nas *Liezi* says: *\"Things have no flaws or diseases.\"*\n\nWondrous yet forming yin and yang,\nprofound yet forming spirits and gods,\nabundant yet forming all living things,\ndispersed yet forming ten thousand things—\nnone but what is properly placed.\nThis is called *the utmost unity*,\nand thus they perpetually make the people without knowledge or desire.\n\nThough the people may have knowledge,\nthey lack use for it—\nthis is the greatest benefit to all under Heaven,\nand thus there is no harm.\n\nStability, peace, and flourishing.\n*Huizong’s Annotation*: Stability means no fear of peril or ruin,\npeace means no risk of danger or unevenness,\nflourishing is when all is thorough and well-governed.\n\n*Exegesis*: Stability is the opposite of danger,\nso stability means no fear of peril or ruin—\nthis is *\"all under Heaven is perpetually stable.\"*\nPeace is the opposite of unevenness,\nso peace means no risk of danger or unevenness—\nthis is *\"all under Heaven is uniformly level.\"*\nFlourishing is the opposite of stagnation,\nflourishing is when blessings extend downward—\nthus *The Book of Changes* says: *\"Flourishing is thorough and well-governed.\"*\n\nFrom stability to peace,\nfrom peace to flourishing—\ngovernance’s effects are thus,\nand without holding to the ancient Dao to govern the present,\nwho could achieve this?\n\nMusic and bait—\npassing travelers pause.\n*Huizong’s Annotation*: Those who delight in sounds and flavors\nare burdened by things.\nBurdened by things yet unable to free themselves,\nthings bind them—\nthus they pause.\n\n*Exegesis*: Their nature is tied to the Five Sounds,\nso the ears crave excessive tones,\nand the Five Sounds confuse the ears,\nmaking the ears dull.\nTheir nature is tied to the Five Flavors,\nso the mouth craves extreme tastes,\nand the Five Flavors—*mà* [overindulgence]—\nmake the mouth lose its sharpness.\nThus, those who delight in sounds and flavors\nare burdened by things.\n\nBurdened by things,\nthe inner and outer *wèi* [vital forces] become tangled and convoluted,\nand none can untie them.\nYet those who cannot free themselves\ndo not know to loosen and open their paths—\nthings bind them.\nEven passing travelers, unable to rest,\nwill pause for them.\n\nThe Dao’s speech is bland yet without flavor.\nTo look upon it is insufficient to see,\nto listen to it is insufficient to hear,\nto use it is never exhausted.\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation*: What the flavor flavors has been tasted,\nyet the flavor itself has never been presented—\nthus it is bland yet without flavor.\nWhat the color colors is made clear,\nyet the color itself has never been displayed—\nthus to look upon it is insufficient to see.\nWhat the sound sounds has been heard,\nyet the sound itself has never been emitted—\nthus to listen to it is insufficient to hear.\nIf so, they can endure bitterness and sweetness,\ncan embrace depth and brightness,\ncan harmonize with *gōng* [first pitch] and *shāng* [second pitch],\nwithout knowing yet without not knowing,\nwithout ability yet without inability—\nthus to use it is never exhausted.\n\n*Exegesis*: The heavens have the Five Phases,\nwhich transform into the Five Flavors,\nbeginning with bland and ending with sweet—\nall are what the flavor flavors.\nWhat the flavor flavors has been tasted,\nyet the flavor itself has never been presented—\nthis is *\"the flavor of the world,\"*\nas *Zhuangzi* says.\nThe Five Colors are made clear,\nwhether by probing their origins or examining their substances—\nall are what the color colors.\nWhat the color colors is made clear,\nyet the color itself has never been displayed—\nthis is *\"the noble is without color,\"*\nas *The Book of Changes* says.\nThe Five Sounds are distinguished:\nclear and turbid, high and low,\nreaching and returning, expansive and tight—\nall are what the sound sounds.\nWhat the sound sounds has been heard,\nyet the sound itself has never been emitted—\nthis is *\"the great sound is rare,\"*\nas the *Classics* say.\nTrue speech is not beautiful,\nthus the Dao’s speech is bland yet without flavor,\nyet can flavor all under Heaven’s flavors.\n\nThe Dao is without form yet perfect,\nthus when seen it cannot be perceived,\nyet it can manifest all under Heaven’s hues.\nIt has no sound, no scent,\nthus when heard it cannot be detected,\nyet it can produce all under Heaven’s tones.\n\nTo flavor all under Heaven’s tastes,\nit can be both sweet and bitter;\nto manifest all under Heaven’s colors,\nit can be both dark and yellow;\nto sound all under Heaven’s tones,\nit can be both *gong* and *shang*.\n\nWithout taste, unseen, unheard,\nit seems as though it knows nothing, can do nothing—\nyet it can flavor all flavors,\ncan sound all sounds,\ncan manifest all colors.\nIts operations are boundless, its uses inexhaustible,\nthus it knows all, can do all.\n\nTherefore, *Liezi* argues that form gives rise to sound and taste,\nyet concludes: *\"without knowing, without ability—*\n*yet without not-knowing, without not-ability,\"*\nthus it is said: *\"Its use cannot be exhausted.\"*\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"Without sound, the Five Tones resound;\nwithout taste, the Five Flavors emerge;\nwithout color, the Five Colors are complete.*\nIs this not what is meant?\n\nNow, the chapter on *\"The Desire to Withdraw\"*—the thirty-sixth.\n\nTo withdraw it, one must first fully extend it;\nTo weaken it, one must first fully strengthen it;\nTo set it in motion, one must first fully arouse it;\nTo take from it, one must first fully give to it.\n\nThe *Huizong* annotation states:\n*\"Yin and Yang illuminate, envelop, and regulate one another;\nThe Four Seasons succeed, generate, and destroy one another.\nThis is the principle of all things, the transmission of human order.\nIn their gathering and dispersing, their flourishing and decline,\ntheir rise and fall, their deficiency and fullness—\noften these shifts emerge from the most subtle beginnings,\nyet their signs are invisible to most.\nOnly the sagely few, who delve into the *ji* (微妙之机),\ncan foresee their auspicious outcomes.\nThe virtuous nearly approach this understanding.\"*\n\nWhen Yang flourishes in summer, Yin arises at *wu* (午);\nWhen Yin congeals in winter, Yang arises at *zi* (子).\n\nKing Goujian sought to weaken Wu, yet urged it to attack Qi;\nZhi Bo sought to seize You Yu, yet gifted him a grand carriage.\nThus the Sage, seeing frost and knowing the coming of solid ice,\nunderstands the waxing and waning of fullness and emptiness—\nnot fixed in their outward forms.\nHence, even the bold cannot weaken, and the wise cannot take.\n\nThe *Exegesis* explains:\n*\"The movement of Yin and Yang—\nwhen one wanes, the other waxes, illuminating and enveloping,\nrising and descending, regulating one another—\nthis is how Yin and Yang envelop, illuminate, and regulate.\nThe Four Seasons proceed: cold and heat alternate,\ngenerating and destroying in succession—\nthe King generates, Ren conquers—\nthis is how the Four Seasons succeed, generate, and destroy.\nThus, all things disperse into myriad forms,\ntheir principles unsaid, their human order transmitted without end.\nWhen gathering reaches its peak, dispersion already stirs—\nthus extension and withdrawal arise.\nWhen flourishing peaks, decline follows—\nthus weakness and strength emerge.\nWhether in sudden anger or collapse, rise or fall,\nwhether in loss or gain, taking or giving—\nthese shifts begin before signs appear,\neven divine vision cannot perceive their forms.\nThe *ji* often arises from the most subtle beginnings,\nyet its portents remain unseen.\nOnly the Sage, discerning in the obscure,\nacts brightly upon the faintest threads—\nby probing deeply and mastering the *ji*,\nthey attain foresight of auspiciousness.\nThough the virtuous may not fully grasp the *ji*,\nyet if they act before chaos arises,\nordering before disorder—\nthey nearly approach this understanding.\"*\n\nNow, when accumulated Yang brings summer’s heat,\nYang flourishes in summer—\nyet *zi* (子) beauty has already waned,\nand Yin is about to emerge.\nWhen accumulated Yin brings winter’s cold,\nYin congeals in winter—\nyet *wu* (午) beauty has reached its peak,\nand Yang is about to arise.\nAs Yang Xiong said:\n*\"Yang does not reach its extreme before Yin does not stir,\nYin does not reach its extreme before Yang does not sprout.\"*\nAll these shifts—\nwithdrawal and extension, ruin and rise, alternating transformations—\nare the workings of Heaven’s principle.\n\nKing Goujian sought to weaken Wu,\nyet urged it to attack Qi—\nto weaken it, he first strengthened it.\nZhi Bo sought to seize You Yu,\nyet gifted him a grand carriage—\nto take from him, he first gave to him.\nHan Fei also said:\n*\"The Duke of Jin, intending to attack Yu,\ngifted him jade and horses.\nZhi Bo, intending to seize You Yu,\ngifted him a grand carriage.\nThus, to take from one, one must first give to them—\nthis is the intent.\"*\n\nThis is the way of human affairs.\n\n「By examining Heaven’s principle and verifying human affairs,\nall things conform to this truth.\nThis is how the Sage perceives patterns and discerns categories—\nwhen Yin first congeals,\nwhen frost is upon the ground and one knows the coming of solid ice.\n\nThus, when Heaven’s principle unfolds—\none aspect fading while another emerges,\none being full while another empties—\nit does not depend on their outward forms,\nbut one can observe the essence of their transformations.\nThough their signs may not yet appear,\ntheir logic is clear and visible.\n\nIf so, then the withdrawal and extension of strength and weakness,\nthe rise and fall of ruin and prosperity,\nof giving and taking, controlling and seizing—\nthese are self-regulating,\nself-operating.\nThe bold dare not flaunt their vigor,\nfor their strength cannot weaken others;\nthe wise dare not deploy their cunning,\nfor their defenses cannot be taken.\n\nIn harmony with the Dao/Way,\nHeaven’s course has already unfolded.\nOnly those who speak of great principles,\ndiscuss the logic of all things,\ncan align with this.\n\nThis is called *subtle clarity* (微明).\nEmperor Huizong annotated:\n*\"Before signs appear, it is subtle (微),\nyet its logic is most evident (甚着).\"*\n\nYang Xiong said in *The Taixuan* (《太玄》):\n*\"When water ebbs into the depths,\nwhen wood decays from its branches,\nthe virtuous perceive it while the masses know not.\"*\n\nThe *Commentary* explains:\n*\"When one is in the midst of advancement,\nit is manifest and easily seen;\nwhen hidden in its unmanifest state,\nit is concealed and difficult to know.\nWithdrawal and extension, strength and weakness,\nrise and fall, giving and taking,\ncontrolling and seizing—\nthese mutually consume and flourish,\nmutually rely and subdue.\nBefore their signs appear,\nthey are profound and obscure,\nunseen in their progression,\nconcealed yet discernible by the subtle.\"*\n\nFrom the perspective of inherent logic,\nexcess leads to decline,\nexhaustion gives rise to rebirth,\ncycling endlessly without pause.\nThough hidden in no outward trace,\ntheir inevitable course is clear and visible.\nThus, before signs appear, it is subtle (微),\nyet their logic is most evident (甚着).\n\nYangzi composed *The Taixuan* (《太玄》), stating:\n*\"When water ebbs into the depths,\nwhen wood decays from its branches,\nthe virtuous perceive it while the masses know not.\"*\n\nThe masses seek its description,\nthe virtuous grasp its logic.\nHence, the virtuous perceive it while the masses know not—\nthe masses differ from the virtuous in this.\n\nSoftness overcomes hardness,\nweakness overcomes strength.\n\nEmperor Huizong annotated:\n*\"Only the Sage can accumulate many small unconquerables\ninto a great unconquerable.\"*\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing surpasses it in overcoming hardness and strength.\"*\n\nIn *Zhuangzi’s Outer Chapters* (《庄子·外篇》),\ndiscussing the mutual regard of the Great Snake and the Wind,\nit is said:\n*\"Point at me, and I will overcome you;\npress against me, and I will overcome you—\nyet in breaking great trees and toppling great houses,\nonly I can do it.\"*\n\nThe *Commentary* explains:\n*\"In terms of personal conduct,\nhardness and strength suffice to overcome softness and weakness;\nin terms of the Dao/Way,\nsoftness and weakness suffice to overcome hardness and strength.\nSoftness overcomes hardness,\nweakness overcomes strength—\nthis is the Dao/Way’s logic.\nAccumulate softness, and it becomes hardness;\naccumulate weakness, and it becomes strength.\nTo seek hardness, one must guard it with softness;\nto seek strength, one must preserve it with weakness.\nIs this not the Dao/Way of perpetual victory?\nThis is what *Zhuangzi* meant when he said:\n*'Only the Sage can accumulate many small unconquerables\ninto a great unconquerable.'*\n\nMoreover, descending from the Dao/Way,\nthose closest to it are like water—\nits nature is fluid and yielding,\nmaking it the world’s ultimate softness,\nyet able to overcome the world’s ultimate hardness.\nAs the *Classics* say:\n*'Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing surpasses it in overcoming hardness and strength.'*\n\nAnd so it is with the Wind—\nwhen it enters through the *xun* (巽, southeast) direction,\nits use is unparalleled in bending all things.\nIt too overcomes hardness and strength with softness and weakness.\n\nIn *Zhuangzi’s Outer Chapters* (《庄子·外篇》),\nit is said of the Snake and the Wind:\n*'Point at me, and I will overcome you;\npress against me, and I will overcome you—\nyet in breaking great trees and toppling great houses,\nonly I can do it.'*\n\nPointing at me, pressing against me, overcoming me—\nthis is the softness and weakness.\nBreaking great trees, toppling great houses—\nthis is the overcoming of hardness and strength.\n\nThe *Transmission* (《传》) says:\n*\"Softness is the Dao/Way’s hardness,\nweakness is the Dao/Way’s strength.\"*\n\nFish cannot be detached from the depths,\nand the state’s sharpest tools\nshould not be displayed to the people.\n\nEmperor Huizong annotated:\n*\"The depths are where fish conceal their bodies.\nSharp tools are the ruler’s ultimate authority,\nby which all things are governed.\nA fish that can swallow a boat,\nif stranded and losing its water,\neven ants can torment it—\nthus it cannot be detached from the depths.\nWhen the ruler shows favor,\nsubjects exploit its influence;\nwhen the ruler inflicts punishment,\nsubjects wield its power.\nFavor and punishment are the means of governance—\nyet even these should not be displayed,\nhow much less the Dao/Way of governance itself?\"*\n\nThe Sage wields sharp tools yet does not display them,\nnot for their strength,\nbut for the subtle Dao/Way within them.\n\nOne can exhaust the seas without gaining fame for wisdom,\ncommand all things without earning credit for valor,\nyet never rely on victory over others\nto attain the Dao/Way of perpetual triumph.\n\nYang opens while Yin closes,\ntransformation endless.\nGuiding the ministers,\nmoving the world—\nnone can fathom it.\nThus, they are governed without being governed.\n\nAuthority lies with the sovereign,\nthe key with the ruler—\nand the world is in order.\n\nThe *Commentary* explains:\n*\"The depths are where water flows back upon itself,\nthe profound and unfathomable.\nFish hide and escape, submerged in the depths—\nthus the depths are where fish conceal their bodies.\nSharp tools are the ruler’s supreme power,\nby which all things are controlled.\nHence, authority lies above,\nand subjects are governed by the ruler—\nsharp tools are the state’s means of control.\nYet fish in water are like people in the Dao/Way:\none cannot for a moment depart from the Dao/Way,\nso fish cannot for a moment lose their water.\nA fish that can swallow a boat,\nif stranded and losing its water,\neven ants can torment it—\nthis is because it was detached from the depths.\nFavor and punishment are visible incentives for the world;\nwhen the ruler personally employs them,\nthe ministers fear his power and submit to his authority.\nIf favor is not bestowed with precision,\nif punishment is not applied with thoroughness—\nthis is the ruler showing favor,\nand the ministers will exploit its influence.\"*\n\nWhen punishment of evil is not thorough,\nthis is the ruler showing punishment,\nand the ministers will exploit its power.\n\nRewards and punishments are the tools of governance,\nyet they must not be openly displayed—\nhow much more so the Dao/Way itself?\nOne may make people follow it,\nbut one must never let them comprehend it.\n\nHan Fei also said:\nRewards and punishments are the state’s sharp tools.\nWhen the ruler displays favor,\nministers will diminish it to claim virtue;\nwhen the ruler displays punishment,\nministers will seize it to claim authority.\nThis is the same principle.\n\nThus, the state’s sharp tools\nmust never be openly shown.\n\nThe Sage wields these tools without revealing them,\nnot by brute force,\nbut by standing in the unfathomable,\nacting in the unseen—\nthere lies a wondrous Dao within,\nby which the divine instruments move without constraint,\nand great things are achieved without loss.\n\nOne can exhaust the realm’s resources without exerting intelligence or strength—\nnot because intelligence or strength are absent,\nbut because their application is beyond naming.\n\nOne can command the realm’s submission without displaying valor—\nnot because valor is absent,\nbut because its deployment escapes the world’s gaze.\n\nThus, it is not a matter of deliberate conquest,\nyet victory is ever secured.\nNot fixated on conquering,\none attains the constant Dao of victory.\n\nThe expansion and contraction of the Dao’s attainment,\nits opening with the Yang and closing with the Yin—\nas the *Transmission* says:\n*\"With the Yin, close together;\nwith the Yang, open together.\"*\n\nTo know the divine’s workings,\nand transform endlessly—\nas the *Transmission* says:\n*\"Manifest in transformation.\"*\n\nWith this, one governs ministers and moves the world,\nyet none can fathom it;\none controls others without being controlled—\nwho else could hold victory so?\n\nThis has no other source:\nit lies in the ruler above.\nRectify the root, and all things align;\ngrasp the essential, and all things are governed.\n\nWithout deliberate governance,\nthe world is already governed.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao’s Constant Non-Action**\n\n*The Dao acts without doing, yet nothing remains undone.*\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nSilent and unmoving,\nyet responsive—\nthus the world is naturally transformed.\n\n**Explanatory Notes:**\nThe Dao has essence and function—\nnon-action is its essence,\nyet its function is boundless action.\n\nIf one seeks the Dao through exclusive non-action,\none drowns in emptiness,\nlosing the Dao’s essence.\nIf one seeks the Dao through exclusive action,\none stagnates in form,\nlosing the Dao’s function.\n\nOnly in silent stillness,\nnon-action without neglecting action,\nresponding yet remaining in non-action—\nonly then does the Dao’s utmost subtlety\nleave no trace behind.\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold this,\nall things would transform of their own accord.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nJust as water reflects form without effort,\nso too the Dao’s contact with the world\nrequires no contrivance—\nyet nothing can escape its shaping.\n\nWhen lords and kings govern by the Dao,\nthey enter the realm of non-action,\nyet emerge from it to transform all things,\nas if by nature’s own doing—\nunknown to those transformed,\nhence *\"self-transformation.\"*\n\n**Explanatory Notes:**\nA clear mirror reveals no dust;\nstill water reflects even eyebrows.\nWater and mirrors respond without storing—\nthus the *Transmission* says:\n*\"Like water reflecting form,\nit requires no contrivance,\nyet nothing can escape its shaping.\"*\n\nHow is the Dao’s response different?\n\nThose who attain this\nbecome emperors above,\nkings below—\nthus, if lords and kings uphold the Dao,\nall things will transform of their own accord.\n\nBefore undertaking deeds or establishing enterprises—\nthis is the king’s Dao.\nModerating conduct and adhering to measure—\nthis is the lord’s duty.\nThus, lords and kings\nare the pivot upon which all things depend.\n\nIf they truly uphold the Dao to govern the times,\ntheir rule over the world and state will be effortless.\n\nThe Dao’s true essence governs the self;\nits remnants govern the state;\nits extensions govern the world.\n\nOnly by embodying the Dao’s non-being,\nresponding to the world’s manifestations,\nintending action yet never acting,\nintending non-action yet never ceasing—\nentering the realm of non-action,\nyet emerging from non-action—\nthus transforming all things,\nall is fulfilled without omission,\nall is measured without exhaustion,\nfrom sentient beings to the insentient—\nnone fail

Annotation:**\nMencius said:\n*\"Those who wait for King Wen to rise before acting\nare merely common folk.\"*\nPeople follow their ruler—\nwhen transformation stirs to action,\nit departs from the Dao to seek goodness,\nrisks virtue to act,\nand strays from nature to follow desire—\nthis is insufficient to stabilize the world.\n\nOnly the Dao, nameless and undifferentiated,\ncan restrain such stirrings.\nThus, the Sage saves the erring with loyalty.\n\n**Explanatory Notes:**\nThe Sage always aids others,\nnever abandoning them—\nthose transformed by the Dao\nall rise anew.\n\nThus Mencius said:\n*\"Those who wait for King Wen to rise before acting\nare merely common folk.\"*\nThe noble’s virtue is like wind,\nthe commoner’s like grass—\ngrass bends with the wind,\nso people follow

self-serving become upright;\nthe arrogant and constrained become harmonized—\nyet even this is not without some artificiality.\n\nWhen transformation stirs to action,\nit departs from the Dao to seek goodness—\nthe Dao’s completeness is impaired;\nit risks virtue to act—\nthe virtue’s essence may falter.\n\nThe Dao has neither goodness nor non-goodness;\nif one clings to goodness,\nit becomes disjointed and severed.\n\nThe highest virtue is without virtue,\nwhen virtue is perfected as action,\nthen it becomes difficult and perilous.\n\nThe Dao and virtue are both innate nature (*xìng*),\nwhile goodness and action are the nature’s manifestation in the heart.\nTo depart from the Dao for goodness,\nto risk virtue for action—\nthis is to abandon nature and follow the heart.\n\nIf one seeks to govern the world with the heart,\nthen heart-to-heart recognition is insufficient to govern the world.\n\nOnly the Dao, nameless and undifferentiated,\nremains undispersed, thus the Sage abides in stillness.\nNameless and without substance,\nit resides in the void of things—\nonly the Dao gathers the void,\nthe Great Primordial, nameless.\n\nWhat is beneath form is called *qì* (instrumental),\nthe Dao transcends form and is not confined by *qì*,\nthus it remains undifferentiated and undispersed.\n\nThe nameless Primordial is the complete essence of the Dao—\nwith this, the Sage abides, and who could suffer from deficiency or excess?\n\nThe nameless Primordial also does not desire.\n\n**Emperor Xuanzong’s Annotation:**\nThe Master’s non-action lies in the slightest inclination of things;\nancient Daoist techniques reside here as well.\n\nThough few can embody the fullness of Heaven and Earth,\nthe Master thus does not desire—\nthis is why Laozi dispels confusion and resolves delusion.\n\n**Explanatory Notes:**\n*\"Clustering blocks, accumulating dust—*\nthough non-action may appear so,\nit is not without principle.\nThus, the Master’s non-action still lies in the slightest inclination of things,\nand ancient Daoist techniques reside here as well.\"\n\nThis reflects the debate between the two schools,\nraised in inquiry to Master Taigong.\n\nNonetheless, the Dao is ever in non-action yet nothing remains undone,\nHeaven and Earth act through non-action.\nThe nameless Primordial is like the Master’s non-action—\nif one acts

nature and destiny—\nthis is called governance at its utmost.\n\n**Explanatory Notes:**\n*\"The noble observes great waters necessarily,\nfor the highest goodness resembles water,\nnearly embodying the Dao.\"*\n\nWater, though shifting in square, round, curve, and straight,\nvaries without constancy—\nyet when still, it is level and balanced;\nthe great artisan takes this as his model—\n*\"The unmoved is level,\"*\nand *\"The ruler’s measure must be balanced.\"*\n\nThe Dao’s essence is thus—\nancient worthies took water as their model.\nWater still becomes level and balanced—\nthis is non-desire in stillness,\nand the great artisan takes this as his model,\nthus the world will naturally align itself.\n\nWith non-desire in stillness, it remains one and unchanging,\nnever straying from correctness.\nNever straying from correctness while first correcting oneself—\nthis is correcting oneself so that things correct themselves,\nthus the world will naturally align itself.\n\nAs Zhuangzi said:\n*\"Only the Sage can correct life to correct all lives,\nonly the Still can still all stillness—*\nthis is the same intent.\"\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"The Creative’s Dao is transformation and change,\neach rectifying its nature and destiny.\"*\n\nSudden, formless revolution is called *change*;\ngradual, form-adapted transformation is called *change*.\nThe Creative’s Dao appears in transformation and change—\nthis is non-action yet nothing remains undone.\nPreserving the form while safeguarding the spirit,\neach has its measure—this is *nature*,\nand continuity without interruption—this is *destiny*.\nAll things rectifying their nature and destiny—\nthis is non-desire in stillness,\nand the world will naturally align itself.\n\nThis chapter begins with *\"The Dao is ever in non-action yet nothing remains undone,\"*\nand ends with *\"the world will naturally align itself.\"*\nThe effects of governance are complete and exhaustive—\nnothing further can be added.\nThis is called governance at its utmost.\n\n**End of *Explanatory Notes on the Dao-De Jing*, Volume Seven.**\n\n**#1** *\"No contesting\"*—this sentence likely has a missing passage.\n**#2** *\"Not straying from correctness\"*—*\"then\"* (*zé*) may be a corruption of *\"its\"* (*qí*).\n\n**Volume Eight of *Explanatory Notes on the Dao-De Jing*,**\nby Jiang Cheng, Student of the Imperial Academy.\n\n**Volume Eight of *Explanatory Notes on the Dao-De Jing* (continued)**\n\nHuizong’s annotation states: *\"The Dao has no fixed form; virtue has completion and deficiency. Aligning with the Dao means there is no virtue to be named, while distinguishing from virtue means there is virtue to be discerned.\"* The *Ren-Yi-Li-Zhi* [仁義禮智], according to their measure, are received, and according to the times, they are applied—this is virtue alone. Those who embody the Dao differ from this, hence they are placed in the lower scriptures.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* state: *\"Adaptability is the Dao; thus the Dao cannot be sought in fixed ways. The Dao beyond form is called the Dao; thus the Dao cannot be sought in fixed forms.\"* The Dao is present in all things: look upward and it is in the heights, look downward and it is in the depths, strive forward and it is in the front, cast aside and it is in the rear. It has no gate, no side path—its boundless radiance extends in all four directions. This is its formlessness. It can be yielding yet firm, soft yet hard, short yet long, round yet square; precious yet empty. Gazing upon it all day, one cannot see it—this is its formlessness.\n\nIf the Dao has no fixed form, how can there be completion and deficiency in virtue? If virtue has a fixed form, how can there not be completion and deficiency in it? Virtue has high and low; only by elevating it can one ascend to its completion, otherwise it will be deficient. Virtue has small and great; only by cultivating it can one progress to its completion, otherwise it will be deficient.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"When virtue is complete, this is called ‘establishment’*; thus virtue indeed has completion.\"* Again he said: *\"The proper may be deficient*; thus virtue indeed has deficiency.\"* Viewed from their unity, it aligns with the Dao, with no virtue to be named—Yang Xiong’s *\"unity is wholeness\"*, Zhuangzi’s *\"virtue encompasses the singularity of the Dao\"*. Viewed from their distinction, it separates from virtue, with virtue to be discerned—Yang Xiong’s *\"separation is dispersion\"*, as the scripture says: *\"When the Great Dao is abandoned, there is Ren and Yi\"* [大道廢有仁義].\n\nRen is the proper conduct for humanity, applied as fitting; Li is the way to enact it; Zhi is the way to know it. The worthy discern its vastness, the unworthy attend to its minutiae. The benevolent see it and call it *Ren*, the wise see it and call it *Zhi*—each receives according to their measure, and applies it according to the times. This is virtue alone.\n\nBut the Dao is otherwise: it universally encompasses all without distinction, flows ceaselessly and fills all without lack, bestows benefits and achieves completion without ever exhausting itself. Who could speak of completion or deficiency in the Dao?\n\nThose who embody the Dao differ from virtue in this way, hence virtue is placed in the lower scriptures.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: \"The Upper Virtue Does Not Virtue\"**\nThe upper virtue does not virtue, hence it has virtue. Huizong’s annotation states: *\"When things are granted life, this is called virtue. If all receive it equally, it is silently in accord with the Dao. When one transgresses, they do not repent; when one is appropriate, they do not feel self-satisfied—this is called ‘not virtue’.\"* When Confucius did not dwell upon his sainthood yet acted in the manner of the sage, this was his way of having virtue.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* state: *\"Speaking of its origin, life is not virtue unless clarified. Speaking of its completion, life is the radiance of virtue.\"* All things within the realm of existence have life, and the reason they live is that they obtain the One. What is the One? Virtue nearly arises from it—Zhuangzi’s *\"the One from which all things arise, the One yet unformed\"*. When things are granted life, this is virtue. If nature is equal and virtue is shared, then all receive it equally. If virtue is in accord with the Dao, then it silently aligns with the Dao.\n\nOnly by knowing nature and reflecting upon virtue, when virtue reaches its initial state, does one move according to principle and act according to the times—this is transgression. Not transgressing by choice, but because principle does not allow otherwise—what is there to repent? When one is appropriate, it is not by choice, but because principle does not allow otherwise—thus one does not feel self-satisfied. The True Person’s virtue is such; this is called ‘not virtue’.\n\nIf otherwise, then reckless and wild behavior, stepping boldly upon the Great Square and moving without restraint, circulating within the central rites—this can be called upper virtue? In the past, Confucius, though endowed by Heaven with the potential for sainthood, when answering Gongxi Hua’s question, said: *\"If it were about sainthood and virtue, how could I dare?\"* When answering Zigong’s question, he said: *\"Sainthood, I cannot achieve; I do not dwell upon my sainthood.\"* Yet when times were clear, he was clear; when times were demanding, he took responsibility; when times were harmonious, he was harmonious. Gathering the great achievements of the Three Sages, Mencius regarded this as the time of sainthood, and said: *\"Since the birth of the people, there has been none like Master Kong.\"* His virtue is evident.\n\nThe lower virtue does not lose virtue, hence it lacks virtue. Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Recognizing and possessing virtue, one is selfish and loses the Dao—what virtue remains?\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* state: *\"The Dao within me has never had a fixed form. If one claims possession of the Dao, the Dao will abandon you. Thus, recognizing and possessing virtue are all delusions.\"* Moreover, to cultivate oneself for private gain and to abandon private gain for the public good—this is what the Dao does for the public, yet to claim possession of the Dao is selfish. Only the selfless can achieve their private gain; how could selfishness not lose the Dao?\n\nTo desire not to lose virtue yet to lack virtue—what else is this but lower virtue?\n\n**The Upper Virtue Acts Without Action, Yet Nothing Remains Unacted**\nHuizong’s annotation states: *\"Without thought yet attaining, without effort yet accurate, without movement yet arriving—this is upper virtue.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* state: *\"One nature has awareness, piercing through the boundless—this is ‘without thought yet attaining’. Employing it without strain, naturally in accord with the Dao—this is ‘without effort yet accurate’. Never exerting force, yet nowhere does it fail to be preserved—this is ‘without movement yet arriving’. If such, then acting is non-acting, and non-acting emerges from acting. The peak of virtue cannot be surpassed—thus it is called upper virtue.\"*\n\n**The Lower Virtue Acts With Action, Yet Nothing Remains Unacted**\nHuizong’s annotation states: *\"Without thought, one does not attain; without effort, one is not accurate; without movement, one does not arrive—this is lower virtue.\"*\n\n**The Virtue of High and Low—Thus the Sage and the Wise Are Distinguished**\n\nVirtue has its high and low—is this not how the sage and the wise are divided?\n\nTo transcend the body and abandon wisdom, to attain the Great Unity—\nRen, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom are to be simplified, yet cannot be discarded,\nand so there is no need for them.\nTo bend and adjust ritual and music,\nto sigh and lament over ren and righteousness,\nto soothe the hearts of the people—\nthis is to gain what others gain,\nyet not to possess it oneself,\nand so there is need for them.\n\n*The Explanatory Notes* state:\nWhen sincerity illuminates, it is called the Dao.\nWhen illumination returns to sincerity, it is called teaching.\nTo attain without thought, to hit without effort, to arrive without movement—\nthis is sincerity illuminating.\nTo think and thus attain, not to think and thus not attain;\nto exert effort and thus hit, not to exert effort and thus miss;\nto act and thus arrive, not to act and thus fail—\nthis is illumination returning to sincerity.\nSincerity illuminating is the work of the sage,\nillumination returning to sincerity is the work of the wise.\nThus virtue has its high and low—\nis this not how the sage and the wise are divided?\n\nUnburdened by the body, unconstrained by wisdom,\nyet transcending the body and abandoning wisdom—\nthe body cannot obstruct,\nwisdom has its own penetration,\nand thus one attains the Great Unity.\nTo forget ren and righteousness,\nto forget ritual and music—\nren, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom are to be simplified, yet cannot be discarded,\nand yet there was never anything to begin with—\nthis is called *without need for them*—\nthis is upper virtue.\n\nTo make music soft and refined, to make ritual precise and orderly,\nyet to bend and adjust ritual and music,\nto make ren pliant and righteousness compliant,\nto sigh and lament over ren and righteousness—\nto use these to soothe the hearts of the people,\nsufficient only to unsettle the hearts of the people—\nthis is to gain what others gain,\nyet not to possess it oneself—\nthis is called *with need for them*—\nthis is lower virtue.\n\n**Upper Ren Acts Yet Has No Need for Action**\nHuizong’s annotation states:\n*\"The sage is born with it—\nseven times he covered the world, yet did not seek personal gain,\nand so there is no need for it.\"*\n\n*The Explanatory Notes* state:\nZhuangzi said: *\"Great ren is not ren.\"*\nWhat is called \"not ren\" is not without ren—\nit is able to ren yet does not use ren as ren.\nThus there is *easy ren* and *utilitarian ren*.\nEasy ren follows naturally without need for action,\nutilitarian ren uses ren for gain and acts accordingly.\nMencius said: *\"The sage is born with it.\"*\nEasy ren is not the same as acting in ren.\nThus ren covers the world without exclusion—\nthis is called upper ren.\nZhuangzi spoke of the sage resting in what is at ease,\nnot resting in what is not at ease,\nand the *Book of Documents* praised Emperor Yao’s virtue as *\"tranquil and tranquil\"*—\nthis is upper ren acting yet having no need for action.\n\n**Upper Righteousness Acts Yet Has Need for Action**\nHuizong’s annotation states:\n*\"To array enemies and measure suitability—this is righteousness,\nto establish oneself and govern affairs—how can one avoid action?\"*\n\n*The Explanatory Notes* state:\nRighteousness in discernment is arraying enemies,\nrighteousness in adaptation is measuring suitability—\nYang Xiong’s *\"arraying enemies and measuring suitability\"* refers to this.\nMencius said: *\"If a person can fill the space between ‘you’ and ‘I’ with righteousness,\nthen righteousness cannot be exhausted in its application.\"*\nThus righteousness certainly establishes oneself.\nYuzi said: *\"To respond to change with righteousness,\nthen righteousness certainly governs affairs.\"*\nBecause it establishes oneself, the *Explanation of Characters* says: *\"Righteousness is ‘I.’\"*\nBecause it governs affairs, the *Book of Documents* says: *\"To govern affairs with righteousness.\"*\nTo establish oneself yet not forget oneself,\nto govern affairs yet not abandon affairs—\nall these involve action,\nand is this not upper righteousness acting yet having need for action?\n\nThe *Book of Songs* speaks of *\"the wildfowl and cranes coming to the ancestral hall\"*—\nyet follows with *\"blessings and prosperity come with them\"*—\nthose who come are welcomed because of their righteousness.\n\n**Upper Ritual Acts Yet Finds No Response**\nHuizong’s annotation states:\n*\"Ritual is for exchanging with others,\nfor demonstrating to people,\nfor regulating and adorning ren and righteousness—\nits uses are many.\nIf no one initiates giving and returning,\nand giving is exhausted yet no one responds,\nthen resentment and contention arise,\nand disorderly changes emerge.\nIn the Spring and Autumn period,\na single unanswered word,\na single unreciprocated bow—\ntwo states would fight to the bones over it,\nand yet this was still to restrain the lesser disorder.\nThe sage is thick in ren yet thin in righteousness,\nand ritual is merely what is trodden upon, not what is dwelled in.\nThus upper ren aligns with virtue,\nupper righteousness has need for action,\nupper ritual finds no response.\"*\n\n*The Explanatory Notes* state:\nTo distinguish is to use arms,\nto exchange is to use the *dou* vessel—\nritual’s use with guests and hosts is when the *dou* is employed—\nthus ritual is for exchanging with others.\nAscending and descending, circling and bowing—\nritual’s presence in ceremony is an external performance—\nthus ritual is for demonstrating to people.\nThe way to establish a person is through ren and righteousness—\nren’s substance lies in filial piety,\nrighteousness’s substance lies in following elders—\nritual’s substance is to regulate and adorn these two—\nthus ritual regulates and adorns ren and righteousness.\nThe *Rites* number three hundred,\nthe *Analects on Ritual* number three thousand—\nfrom solemn rites to joyous rites,\nfrom rites for heavenly spirits to rites for human ghosts—\nits uses are many.\nIn summary, it is about giving and returning first—\nthe *Records* say: *\"The highest virtue values virtue,\nthe next values giving and returning.\"*\nYet ritual values reciprocity—\nto give without returning,\nto return without giving—\nall are unritual.\nWhen giving is exhausted yet no one responds,\nthen resentment and contention arise—\nthis is inevitable.\nIn the Spring and Autumn period,\na single unanswered word,\na single unreciprocated bow—\ntwo states would fight to the bones over it—\nthis was because action was met with no response.\nThus to restrain the lesser disorder by rolling up one’s sleeves and persisting.\nThe sage knew this—\nwhat is close yet cannot be too broadly applied is ren,\nso virtue cannot be too thick in ren.\nWhat is distant yet cannot be too narrowly occupied is righteousness,\nso the Dao cannot be too thin in righteousness.\nAs for ritual—\nto depart and not linger,\nto pass and not dwell—\nit is merely what is trodden upon, not what is dwelled in.\n\nThus it is that the proper footwear for advancing—\nthe ritual of what is trodden upon—\nis so because it is lowly yet what all tread upon,\nand thus ritual is what is walked upon, not dwelled in.\n\nThe *Yijing* takes heaven above and marsh below as \"trodden upon,\"\nand says, \"Trodden upon, yet not dwelled in\"—\nthis is why it is so.\n\nThe ancient Perfect Ones did not know where ritual would lead,\nyet they forgot themselves in the Dao and its arts—\nthis is because of this.\n\nThus, supreme virtue aligns with power yet does nothing,\nsupreme righteousness has something to establish itself upon,\nsupreme ritual has those who do not respond to it—\nyet it cannot escape its burdens.\n\nTherefore, one loses the Dao and then attains virtue,\nloses virtue and then attains ren,\nloses ren and then attains righteousness,\nloses righteousness and then attains ritual.\n\nRitual, then, is the thinning of loyalty and trust—\nand the origin of chaos.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe Dao cannot be attained, so one loses the Dao and then attains virtue.\nVirtue cannot be hoarded, so one loses virtue and then attains ren.\nRen can be cultivated, and when cultivated, it approaches righteousness—\nso one loses ren and then attains righteousness.\nRighteousness can be diminished, and when diminished, it is adorned with ritual—\nso one loses righteousness and then attains ritual.\n\nAs for ritual, the farther it strays from the Dao, the more it loses.\nAll things do not flourish simultaneously—\nthis is yin and yang.\nThey take from one another—\nthis is威 (awe) and德 (virtue).\nWhere substance is thick, appearance is thin—\nthis is the ritual of father and son.\n\nThus observed, the more elaborate the ritual,\nthe more surely substance decays.\nWhen substance decays, deceit follows,\nand contention and chaos arise—\nhence, ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nand the origin of chaos.\n\n**Explanation of Meaning:**\nThe Dao is ever without action, thus without form—\nwithout form, it is not \"that.\"\nHence, it cannot be attained.\nYet the Dao is the revered foundation of virtue—\nso one loses the Dao and then attains virtue.\nVirtue, once obtained, is within oneself—\nwithin oneself, there is nothing external—\nhence, it cannot be hoarded.\nYet virtue encompasses all that can be done as ren—\nso one loses virtue and then attains ren.\nVirtue is without action, but ren carries the heart of love and benefit—\nthus ren can be cultivated.\nYet when cultivated, it approaches righteousness—\nso one loses ren and then attains righteousness.\nRighteousness, when thick in substance, must be set in proper measure—\nthus it can be diminished.\nWhen diminished, it is adorned with ritual—\nso one loses righteousness and then attains ritual.\n\nFrom losing the Dao to ritual,\neach descent is lower,\nthe farther from the Dao,\nthe more is lost.\nFor action brings deceit,\nnon-action brings truth—\nthus their difference is so great.\n\nNon-action, then, is the root of all things,\nand the reason virtue is supreme—\nthis is so.\n\nMoreover, the ebb and flow never cease,\nkings rise and fall in succession,\nthings do not flourish simultaneously—\nthis is yin and yang.\nWhen yang prevails, yin withdraws in listening,\nwhen yin prevails, yang hides in concealment.\nWhat is diminished here must overflow there—\nthis is awe and virtue.\nTo govern with virtue, awe is not the priority;\nto rule with awe, virtue comes afterward—\nthis is the natural order, unchangeable.\n\nThus, the ritual of father and son,\nthough thin in appearance, is thick in substance—\nas Zhuangzi said:\n*\"Dressing like a market peddler’s feet,\nhe excuses himself with fright,\nhis brother with a nurse’s voice,\nand with great respect for his elders—*\nthis is the meaning.\n\nThus observed, elaborate ritual decays in substance—\nlike a tree not yet flourishing, its root must already be weak.\nWhen substance decays, deceit follows,\nand contention and chaos arise—\nhow then could it be substantial yet unknown as loyal?\nHow could it be proper yet unknown as trustworthy?\n\nGiven how ritual fosters deceit in this way,\none must abandon the false and take the true,\nand extinguish it.\n\nThe *Records* say that loyal and trustworthy persons can learn ritual—\nthis is because it values its root.\n\n**Premature Knowledge** is the flower of the Dao,\nand the beginning of folly.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe Dao descends and manifests,\nmanifests and gives rise to wisdom.\nWisdom, when used as a chisel,\nsharpened and applied,\nwears out the spirit and recklessly measures—\nthis is premature knowledge.\nPremature knowledge follows superficiality and forgets the root—\nthus it is the flower of the Dao.\nThe heart labors, and wisdom grows more constrained—\nthus it is the beginning of folly.\nThough it often succeeds, this is why Confucius despised Zigong.\n\n**Explanation of Meaning:**\nRen, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom—\nnone are outside virtue.\nThe Dao descends and manifests,\nmanifests and gives rise to wisdom.\nThough wisdom branches from the Dao,\nit is still rooted in the Dao.\nYet what Confucius despised in wisdom\nwas its inability to act without interference—\nthis is using wisdom as a chisel.\nHow much more so when probing the nature of things,\nsharpening its grasp,\nwearing out the spirit in shallow depths,\nrecklessly measuring—\nthis is premature knowledge,\nthe flower of the Dao, not its substance.\nThough it may seem plausible, it is not so.\nFor minor knowledge harms virtue,\nlost knowledge harms the Dao—\nbut premature knowledge,\nboasting cleverness and skill,\nalready follows superficiality and forgets the root,\nnot knowing to nourish the source of wisdom\nwhile frugally expending it—\nthough it has not yet reached harming virtue or the Dao,\nit is still not the true Dao.\n\nIf so, then deceit arises,\nthe heart labors daily, growing more clumsy,\nand wisdom is constrained—\nthis is the nature of premature knowledge,\nand why it is the beginning of folly.\nThough it often succeeds, this is why Confucius despised Zigong.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Do not anticipate deceit,\ndo not recklessly measure the untrustworthy.\"*\nYet this was the foresight of the virtuous—\nhow much more so the wise?\n\nThus, the superior person dwells in substance, not in superficiality,\nresides in truth, not in its adornment—\nand so abandons the false to take the true.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nWhat is \"there\" is what the Dao rejects.\nWhat is \"here\" is what the Dao upholds.\nWhat the Dao upholds is thick, not thin,\nsubstantial, not superficial—\nunless one’s wisdom is sufficient to know oneself,\nreturning to one’s original nature\nwithout drifting into the habits of things—\nwho could do this?\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Thickly restore, without regret—\nself-examination in the center.\"*\nThick—this is the utmost of substance.\nA person born with substance is nature itself.\n\nTo restore one’s nature is simply to dwell in substance—\nthis is how the superior person fulfills the Dao and preserves virtue.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nTo feign with propriety or contrive with cleverness\nare both distant from the Dao, belonging to \"there.\"\n\nThe highest virtue acts without action yet lacks nothing,\nthe highest benevolence acts yet lacks nothing—\nboth are not far from the Dao, belonging to \"here.\"\n\nWhat belongs to \"there\" pursues trifles and forgets the root,\nthus the Dao rejects it.\nWhat belongs to \"here\" returns to substance and fortifies thinness,\nstrives for truth and abandons adornment,\nthus the Dao upholds it.\n\nWhat the Dao upholds is thick yet not thin,\nsubstantial yet without adornment—\nonly those who see goodness clearly and wield firm resolve\ncan know themselves with sufficient wisdom,\nrefining their nature to return to virtue\nwithout drifting into the habits of things.\nThus they abandon the falsehoods of contrived action\nand take the truth of non-action.\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Thickly restore, without regret—\nself-examination in the center.\"*\nThick—this is the utmost of substance.\nIf we speak of *dunren* (thick benevolence),\nit means benevolence is the utmost substance.\nIf we speak of *dunhua* (thick transformation),\nit means transformation is the utmost substance.\nOnly when people are born with substance,\nfollowing nature’s shifts,\ndoes one’s birth substance become the nature of Heaven.\nIf one truly restores this utmost substance,\nall actions will lead to auspiciousness—\nwho would have cause for regret or blame?\nThis is the foundation of restoration,\nexplaining *\"thickly restore, without regret.\"*\nUnless wisdom suffices to know oneself,\none cannot attain this.\nThus the symbol speaks of self-examination in the center,\nwhile Confucius said: *\"Restore to know oneself.\"*\nThis is how the superior person fulfills the Dao and preserves virtue—\nits foundation lies here.\n\n**On the Chapter \"The Ancient Who Obtained Oneness\" (Thirty-Ninth):**\nThe ancient who obtained oneness—\nHeaven obtained oneness and became clear,\nEarth obtained oneness and became tranquil,\nThe spirit obtained oneness and became numinous,\nThe valley obtained oneness and became full,\nAll things obtained oneness and were born,\nThe sovereign obtained oneness and became the rectifier of the world—\nthis is the attainment of oneness.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nZhuangzi said: *\"To penetrate to oneness is to complete all things.\"*\nAttaining oneness means not being dual,\nembracing oneness means not departing,\nguarding oneness means not shifting.\nTo know oneness is to know all things;\nnot to know oneness is to know nothing.\nThe ancient who obtained oneness\nembodied the utmost precision of the world—\nnothing could pair with it.\nThus, firmly established above,\nit was pure and unmixed;\nprecipitously grounded below,\nit was still and unchanging.\nIn the most profound darkness, formless—\nthis is the spirit, which, obtaining oneness, does not grow dim.\nIn the utmost emptiness, responsive—\nthis is the valley, which, obtaining oneness, does not exhaust.\nAll things transform from essence into form,\nthus obtaining oneness to be born.\nThe sovereign rules alone over the multitude,\nthus obtaining oneness to rectify the world.\nFrom Heaven and Earth down to the sovereign,\nthough high and low differ in station,\ndark and bright vary in dispersion—\nHeaven’s clarity, Earth’s tranquility,\nthe sovereign’s rectification of the world\nare not sought externally but attained through oneness alone.\nThus it is said: *\"This is the attainment of oneness.\"*\n\n**Exegesis:**\nThe Dao, obscure in non-being,\nis hidden in the unformed oneness;\nthe Dao, descending into being,\nis divided among the myriad differences.\nWithin the undifferentiated,\nthe unformed gives rise to the formed—\nthe Two Principles are thus established,\nthe myriad things thus dispersed.\nIn darkness, the spirit;\nin brightness, humanity—\nall converge in oneness.\nWhat is this oneness?\nIt is the number of essence.\nAll things within the realm,\ngoverned by fixed numbers,\ndo not originate outside this oneness.\nThe *Great Correlation*’s number is fifty,\nits use forty-nine—\none must always leave one empty.\nThe Nine Categories begin with the Five Phases,\nyet the Five Phases must be one—\nsaying *\"water is one\"* means\nit originates from the beginning of fixed numbers,\nand thus one can act through the myriad.\nThe Six Wings and Four Openings—\nits operation is nowhere absent.\nZhuangzi said: *\"To penetrate to oneness is to complete all things.\"*\nIs this not that virtue encompasses the Dao’s oneness?\nTo obtain this oneness and align with it,\nto extend it in action—\nits use is boundless.\nSpirit and essence arise from the Dao,\nform originates from essence—\nwhen a person is born,\nspirit gathers with essence, the likeness is complete,\nand essence remains whole, not borrowed from without.\nIf oneness flows into artifice,\ntrue essence is swiftly lost.\nTo associate with others is to obstruct the heart.\nIf one wishes to preserve one’s form without disturbing one’s essence,\nwhat path leads to this?\nIt lies in attaining oneness to focus upon it,\nembracing oneness to preserve it,\nguarding oneness to solidify it—\nthen form is whole, essence is restored,\nand one becomes one with Heaven.\nEssence and spirit merge and do not separate.\n\nThe *Yijing* speaks of attaining oneness:\n*\"To attain oneness is to concentrate one’s will—\nthus not dual.\"*\nThe Classic says: *\"To embrace oneness, can one not depart?\"*\nTo embrace oneness is to hold fast without slipping—\nthus not departing.\nZhuangzi said: *\"I guard my oneness to dwell in harmony.\"*\nTo guard oneness is to remain still and focused—\nthus not shifting.\nTo know these three is to obtain oneness.\nYet obtaining it is not difficult;\nto know that oneness is difficult.\nTo know oneness is to know all things—\nthis is *\"the few obtain it.\"*\nNot to know oneness is to pair with it—\nall remain within oneness.\nThus the *Qian* (Creative) Dao seems difficult,\nfirmly established above yet ever easy—\neasy, yet pure and unmixed.\nThe *Yijing* on *Qian* says: *\"Strong, healthy, central, pure, precise\"—\nis this not Heaven obtaining oneness to become clear?*\nThe *Kun* (Receptive) Dao seems complex,\nprecipitous yet ever simple—\nsimple, yet still and unchanging.\nThe *Yijing* on *Kun* says: *\"Utterly still, virtue complete\"—\nis this not Earth obtaining oneness to become tranquil?\nThe unfathomable, the unrecognizable—\nthis is the spirit.\nThough the spirit is most profound,\ncalamity and fortune follow their kinds most clearly—\nthis is because obtaining oneness does not lead to dimness.\n\n「Not to grasp nor to resist—\nthe most void yet ever responsive—\nthis is the *Gu* (Valley).\n\nThe *Gu* is utterly void,\nyet its vast and subtle echoes answer without distinction—\nthis is because obtaining oneness brings forth boundless resonance.\n\nHeaven and Earth receive the *Qian* (Creative) essence to become *Yin* and *Yang*,\n*Yin* and *Yang* focus the essence to form the four seasons,\nthe four seasons disperse the essence to create myriad things,\nand all things transform essence into form—\nthis is rooted in the *Gu* alone.\nThus, obtaining oneness brings forth life.\n\nOnly the void can respond to the real,\nonly stillness can govern movement,\nonly oneness can traverse all things.\nRulers and kings, who alone command the multitude,\nembody this principle—\nthus, obtaining oneness, they uphold the *Zheng* (Rectification) of the world.\n\nFrom Heaven and Earth down to rulers and kings,\nhigh and low occupy distinct positions,\ndark and bright diverge in their forms—\nthese are the three *Ji* (Extremes).\nThough each has its own established nature,\nthey share the functions of the three *Cai* (Talents),\nyet remain distinct in their operations.\n\nTrace their origins—\nwhy Heaven is clear, why Earth is tranquil,\nwhy rulers and kings uphold the *Zheng* (Rectification) of the world—\ncould they be separate from oneness?\n\nThis oneness,\nfounded in inherent stability,\nharmonized with natural law,\nresides within the utmost stillness,\nwhere its essence is most true.\nIt is achieved through oneness alone—\nno external pursuit is needed.\nThis is the *\"Zhi Yi\"* (Attaining Oneness),\nis it not?\n\nHeaven, without clarity, would fear collapse,\nEarth, without tranquility, would fear eruption,\nThe spirit, without vitality, would fear exhaustion,\nThe *Gu* (Valley), without fullness, would fear depletion,\nAll things, without life, would fear annihilation,\nRulers and kings, without *Zheng* (Rectification) and noble virtue, would fear ruin.\n\nThe *Huizong* (Emperor Huizong) annotated:\nHeaven’s duty is to nurture and cover,\nEarth’s duty is to shape and bear.\nIf Heaven collapses, how can it cover?\nIf Earth erupts, how can

essence and *qi* become things—\nlife arises from obtaining oneness.\nWhen dispersed, wandering spirits become transformations—\nannihilation follows the loss of oneness.\nOnly through *Zheng* (Rectification) can one govern all changes,\nconstantly attaining oneness,\nthus upholding all beings,\ntranscending and standing alone above all things—\nits enduring and prominent influence is evident.\n\nTo seek nobility without peril,\nthis lies in the principle alone.\n\nHence, nobility roots in humility,\nheight begins with the lowly.\n\nThe *Huizong* annotated:\nHumility is what nobility relies upon for stability,\nthe lowly is what height originates from.\n\nCommon folk see only the superficial,\nwhile sages discern the foundation.\nCommon folk observe only the accomplished,\nwhile sages perceive the subtle beginnings—\nthus they always attain oneness.\n\nThe *Shuyi* (Explanatory Notes) say:\nNobility and humility have fixed roles,\nheight and low have defined positions—\nthese are immutable distinctions.\n\nYet nobility must root in humility,\nfor humility is what nobility depends upon for stability—\nthe lowly among the people are the source of its foundation.\nHeight must begin with the lowly,\nfor the lowly are what height arises from—\nthe humble origins of the *Tai* (Altar) and *Lai* (Sacrificial Platform) are the basis for establishing *Taiping* (Great Peace).\n\nExamine the principles of things,\nand none defy this pattern—\nhow much more so in human affairs?\n\nCommon folk chase fleeting trends,\nyet the farther they stray from the Dao,\nthe more they see only the superficial.\n\nSages discern the foundation,\nembodying the Dao’s void,\nfree from arrogance and excess.\n\nClinging to past traces,\nthey fail to grasp where true insight lies—\nthus they see only the accomplished.\n\nSages perceive the subtle,\npenetrating its essence,\nuntainted by boastful words—\nthus they always attain oneness,\neven amid ten thousand changes, remaining unharmed.\n\nThe *Shijing* (Classic of Poetry) sings of *Tianbao* (Heaven’s Protection),\nmeaning rulers know how to humble themselves,\nthus completing their governance,\nand ministers return praise to their superiors—\nthis too is nobility rooted in humility,\nheight founded in the lowly.\nThis is why the foundation endures without limit.\n\nExamine the end of its composition,\nand one sees sages ruling by the Dao,\nguiding the times—\npreventing fullness from reaching excess and failing,\nelevation from peaking and then declining,\ncompletion from crumbling,\nand flourishing from decaying,\nthus preserving the world’s order.\n\nTherefore, rulers and kings call themselves *\"Gu Gua Bu Gu\"* (Lonely, Weak, and Not Valley-like)—\nis this not their humility as foundation?\nIs it not?\n\nThe *Huizong* annotated:\n*\"Gu Gua Bu Gu\"* (Lonely, Weak, and Not Valley-like)\nare names of humility,\nyet rulers and kings use them as titles—\nknowing their roots alone.\n\nThus rulers and kings bear noble virtue without peril—\nis this not through this principle?\n\nThe *Shuyi* (Explanatory Notes) say:\nRulers and kings alone command the multitude,\nso their comprehensive governance is universal.\nTheir virtue nurtures the world,\nand their administration is thoroughly benevolent.\nTheir titles reflect unique distinctions,\nyet they use *\"Gu Gua Bu Gu\"* (Lonely, Weak, and Not Valley-like)—\nthe names of humility—\nto embody their modest, yielding, and self-effacing nature,\nnot claiming authority for themselves.\nCould this be done by those who do not know the foundation?\n\nDuke Zeng said:\n*\"Cōngmíng shèngzhì\"* (Wisdom and sagely insight),\nthey guard with *\"yú\"* (foolishness);」\n\n「Their achievements benefit the land,\nyet they preserve them with humility.\nThese are all the Dao of the sage’s modesty—\nonly rulers and kings know to govern themselves thus,\nand so they endure noble virtue for ten thousand generations without losing it.\nIs it not true that humility is not the root of evil?\n\nThus they attain many praises yet no true praise.\nThe *Huizong* (Emperor Gaozong) notes:\n*\"If one elevates oneself to overcome others,\nif one claims nobility to degrade others,\nif one is strong yet does not know to yield with gentleness,\nif one is bright yet does not know to temper with darkness—\nseeking praise from the world while their governance earns frequent commendation—\nthen exaggerated praise will gather swiftly,\nand baseless slander will follow soon after,\nand thus they earn no true praise.\"*\n\nThe *Shuyi* (Explanatory Notes) say:\n*\"Not by others’ lowliness do we raise ourselves,\nthen will people gladly exalt us;\nNot by others’ degradation do we claim our nobility,\nthen will people honor and revere us.\nTo elevate oneself to overcome others—\nthis is artificial pride, what use is there in such elevation?\nTo claim nobility by degrading others—\nthis is leveraging power, what use is there in such nobility?\nGentleness overcomes rigidity—\nthis is the natural order;\nrigidity yet unaware of yielding to gentleness—\nthis is knowing only extension, not knowing retreat.\nBrightness without blinding—\nthis is the Dao’s return;\nbrightness yet unaware of tempering with darkness—\nthis is knowing only display, not knowing subtlety.\nWith this, they boast of the world’s flaws,\nthough it may suffice to sell their name and earn frequent commendation,\nit is merely a violation of the Dao to provoke it.\nIf so, then unearned praise will gather swiftly,\nand baseless slander will follow soon after—\nhow could they escape Mencius’ scorn?\nSeeking praise like this—\nthen their reputation floats above true merit, what difference does it make?\nWhen the channels are full, their drying can be awaited,\nand praise will soon be followed by blame—\nhow can it endure long?\nTo call this *no true praise*—\nis this not fitting?\n\nThey do not wish to be *glittering like jade*,\nnor *rugged like stone*.\nThe *Huizong* notes:\n*\"Jade is noble, stone is base,\nyet both are fixed and unchanging.\"*\n\nThe sage rides the times and follows nature,\nunhindered in their course,\nwith all change yet the heart ever steady—\nthis is the true attainment of *Oneness*.\nThus they cannot be fixed as noble or base.\nMencius said:\n*\"What I detest in those who cling to Oneness,\nis that they cling to one thing while abandoning the hundred.*\nThey do not wish to be *glittering like jade*,\nnor *rugged like stone*—\nonly the sage who knows the transformations can reach this,\nand this is called *Supreme Virtue*.\"*\n\nThe *Shuyi* say:\n*\"Virtue has essence and function,\nwith all change contained within it.\nWondrously observing its essence—\nall myriad things can be gathered into Oneness;\nbroadly observing its function—\nwith Oneness, all myriad things can be enacted.\nAdjusting and responding to it—\nno action is unfit,\nflowing through the mechanisms of emergence and return,\ncirculating in the uses of transformation—\nthis is the true Oneness,\nserene and alone in its existence.\nHow could it be like the *glittering jade* that is noble yet cannot be base,\nor the *rugged stone* that is base yet cannot be noble,\nbound to a fixed essence,\ngrasped yet unchanging?\nThe sage’s movement is like water,\nskilled in timing yet never lost,\navoiding obstacles yet never blocked,\nadapting to square and round, straight and bent—\nresponding to change without constancy,\nhow could there be any hindrance?\nThe deeper the inquiry, the farther the exploration,\nthough it encompasses myriad transformations,\nit remains ever true to the One—\nthis is the true attainment of Oneness.\nThus they cannot be fixed as noble or base,\nfor Oneness knows no nobility or baseness.\nLaozi, having clarified the meaning of Oneness,\nfurther warned those who cling to one-sidedness,\nlest they be blinded by a single perspective,\nunable to encompass all and ignorant of ultimate truth—\nrigid like jade and stone,\nstuck and unyielding.\nThus he reiterated his teaching.\nMencius said: *‘What I detest in those who cling to Oneness,\nis that they cling to one thing while abandoning the hundred.’*\nThis is exactly his intent.\nThus they do not wish to be *glittering like jade*,\nnor *rugged like stone*—\nonly the sage who is vast and transformative can reach this.\nThe *Yijing* says: *‘To exhaust the spirit and know the transformations,\nthis is the height of virtue.’*\nThe sage’s way of knowing the transformations—\nis also through *non-action* and *non-inaction*,\nand this is called *Supreme Virtue*.\"*\n\n**Chapter 40: *Fǎn* (Return) of the *Yijing* (Changes)**\n*The *Fǎn* (Return) is the Dao’s movement—\nthe *weak* is the Dao’s use.\nAll things under heaven are born of *having*,\nand *having* is born of *non-having*.\nThe *Huizong* notes:\n*\"The principles of all under heaven—\nmovement and stillness interdepend,\nstrength and weakness complement each other.\nThe myriad things, each returning to their root,\nthen already past yet return again,\nrestoring to the utmost stillness.\nYet, when they are stirred and thus connect with all under heaven,\nthen movement is none other than myself,\nand thus it is said: *‘The *Fǎn* (Return) is the Dao’s movement.’*\nGentleness overcomes rigidity,\nweakness overcomes strength—\nthe Dao’s wondrous use lies here.\nZhuangzi said: *‘The accumulation of many small non-victories becomes a great victory,\nonly the sage can do this,’*\nand thus it is said: *‘The *weak* is the Dao’s use.’*\nThe seasons’ course—\nthey gather and store in winter,\nonly to flourish and renew in spring.\nWater’s nature is utmost gentleness,\nyet in attacking rigidity and strength,\nnone can surpass it—\nis this not what is meant?\nThus *having* and *non-having* generate each other,\nlike a cycle—\nso *non-having* gives rise to movement,\nand *having* reaches its limit and returns to *non-having*,\nlike the *Yin* and *Yang* of the *Yijing*’s *Xī* (The Last) hexagram,\nyet they cannot be said to negate each other.\nThose who are obscured by *non-action*,\ndrowned in *partial action*—\nhow could this be the Dao?\"\n\nThe *Shuyi* say:\n*\"Movement arises from stillness established,\nand all under heaven’s moving lines return to stillness;\nstrength arises from weakness accumulated,\nand all under heaven’s strong lines must gather from weakness.\nThus movement and stillness interdepend,\nstrength and weakness complement each other—\nthis is the natural order.\nThe myriad things’ birth—\nthey flow in countless forms,\nlike the swift and the fleeting,\nyet in their end,\nthey shed their superficiality and return to their true nature,\nrestoring to their dwelling place.\nThe myriad things, each returning to their root—\nthis is the order of nature.\nThus when they are already past,\nthey trend toward the path of movement’s emergence,\nand when they return to their source,\nthey restore to the realm of utmost stillness.\nBeing able to settle and respond,\nstirred yet naturally connecting with all under heaven,\nwhile movement is none other than myself—\nthis is how *Return* establishes movement,\nand thus it is said: *‘The *Fǎn* (Return) is the Dao’s movement.’*\"*\n\nThe soft is the Dao’s strength—\nthus soft overcomes hard.\nThe weak is the Dao’s power—\nthus weak overcomes strength.\nThe soft and weak—\nthis is the Dao’s *wu* (non-being).\nNon-being as a function—\nthus the Dao’s function lies here.\n\nYet weakness is the Dao’s root,\nand guarding the root means\nself-mastery alone.\nThus without defeat,\none attains the Dao of constant victory.\nAs Zhuangzi said:\n*\"Accumulating countless small non-victories\nbecomes great victory.\"*\nOnly the Sage can do this—\nprecisely this is meant.\nThus it is said: *‘The weak is the Dao’s function.’*\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Stopped yet yielding, movement never ceases—*\n*is this not what is meant?\"*\n\nObserve the four seasons:\nIf winter’s enclosure is not firm,\nspring’s growth will not flourish.\nThus one must withdraw and store in winter\nbefore luxuriance blooms in spring.\n\nObserve water’s nature:\nIt receives filth and grime,\nyet abides in softness and weakness,\nuncontending—\nand none can surpass it in overcoming hardness.\nHow different is this?\n\nNow, all things generate through form,\nyet the formed cannot form\nwhat forms it.\nFalling into *you* (being),\nthe formed is called *wu* (non-being).\nNon-being does not abolish being,\nthus it manifests in the east and south;\nthings do not remain in being,\nthus they bend toward the west and north in *wu*.\nBeing and non-being generate each other,\nlike a cycle—\nso with non-being’s movement,\nnon-being generates being,\nand being, reaching its limit,\nmust return to non-being.\nLike east and west,\nthough their directions differ,\nneither can be omitted.\n\nThose drowned in the Dao’s stillness,\nlike Ji Zhen’s *\"doing nothing,\"*\nor those blinded by the Dao’s movement,\nlike Jiezi’s *\"sometimes acting,\"*\nare they truly the Dao?\n\n---\n**Chapter 41: The Superior Person Hears the Dao**\n\nThe superior person hears the Dao\nand diligently practices it.\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation:*\nThe scholar who aspires to the Dao—\nthe superior person, through sincere and unceasing effort,\naccumulates strength over time.\n\n*Exegesis:*\nTools and vessels are mere instruments;\nthus neither the high nor low defy them.\nThe scholar is one whose talent reaches upward—\nwhat is above form is called the Dao.\nIf his talent ascends, his aspiration toward the Dao is clear.\nThe so-called superior person\nis one who excels as a scholar\nand holds high his resolve.\nThus when he hears the Dao,\nhis devotion is unwavering,\nhis faith profound.\nDaily he knows what he lacks,\nand with unflagging effort, he acts—\nbeginning as a scholar,\nending as a Sage.\nAs Master Kong said:\n*\"True accumulation of strength over time.\"*\nHe dwells in ease,\nguards with firmness,\nstudies as if never enough,\nand only ceases with death.\nNever does he wish to rest midday—\nas the *Records* say:\n*\"The utmost sincerity never ceases.\"*\nLike Yanzi, who heard the Dao\nand never grew weary—\nis this not *\"diligently practicing it\"*?\n\nThe mediocre person hears the Dao,\nas if it exists, as if it does not.\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation:*\nThe mediocre person harbors doubt,\nand doubt divides his resolve.\nThus toward the Dao,\nhe is sometimes drawn,\nsometimes repelled.\n\n*Exegesis:*\nAbove the common man,\none may speak of the superior.\nThe mediocre person is not of superior wisdom,\nso when he hears the Dao,\nhis heart is not steadfast.\nHe sees the Dao with doubt,\nthus doubts arise.\nHis resolve is divided,\nhis spirit congealed.\nThe mediocre person cannot be taught the superior,\nfor his heart is not steadfast\nand he harbors doubt.\nDoubt obstructs him—\nsometimes he clings,\nsometimes he drifts.\nHis resolve is divided,\nyet he cannot unite.\nLike Zixia, who exited to see\nthe splendor of the world and took delight,\nthen entered to hear\nthe Master’s teaching and found joy—\nis this not *\"as if it exists, as if it does not\"*?\n\nThe inferior person hears the Dao\nand laughs—\nnot to laugh is not to grasp the Dao.\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation:*\nThe inferior person lacks faith to uphold it,\nand wisdom to comprehend it,\nthus he laughs.\nThe Dao has no form, color, sound, or taste to grasp—\nit is far removed\nfrom what the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth desire.\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Great sounds do not enter the vulgar ear,\nprofound words do not dwell in the common heart.\"*\n\n*Exegesis:*\nMusic and bait may halt travelers,\nbut the Dao, when spoken,\nis as insipid as non-being.\nThe inferior person, lacking lofty vision,\naligns with the vulgar.\nHis convictions are unsteady,\nhis faith insufficient to guard.\nHis sight is narrow,\nhis wisdom inadequate to illuminate.\nThus he scorns the Dao as shameful\nand laughs at it.\nThere is a boundary between them—\nhis perception is burdened by things,\nnot the Dao;\nthis one’s hearing unites with the Dao,\nnot things.\nThe Dao is not transmitted through form, color, sound, or taste—\nit is far removed\nfrom what the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth desire.\nThe Dao and things are thus unequal,\nbounded by this division.\nHence the shallow may laugh at it.\nIf the Dao were like things,\nburdened by traces,\nit could be cast to the masses’ desires—\nthen the Dao would be small.\nThus not to laugh is not to grasp the Dao.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Great sounds do not enter the vulgar ear,\nprofound words do not dwell in the common heart.\"*\nWhen sound reaches subtlety,\nfew know its harmony;\nwhen words reach subtlety,\nfew understand them.\nThe Dao, at its subtlest,\nis like great sound and profound speech—\nthus the scholar laughs at it.\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Few know me—\nthus I am precious.\"*\nThe meaning is the same.\n\nThus the *Jianyan* says:\n*\"Illuminating the Dao is like darkness—\"*\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation:*\nIf the sun and moon\nshine upon the earth,\nthis is illumination.\nYet their wisdom is vast yet unshown,\ntheir light borrowed yet not dazzling—\nthus it seems like darkness.\n\n*Exegesis:*\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"The sun and moon push each other,\nand illumination arises.\"*\nMaster Kong said:\n*\"In Heaven, none are brighter than the sun and moon.\"*\nThe sun shines by day,\nthe moon by night.\nWhen they hang high in the sky\nand illuminate the earth below,\nthis is illumination.\nThe Dao’s brilliance is easy to see,\nyet it is demonstrated without secrecy—\nlike the sun and moon’s light upon the earth,\nthis is *\"illuminating the Dao.\"*\n\nThe *Classic* further states:\n*\"Yet the essence of the Way is profound and unfathomable,\nthe ultimate of the Way is dim and silent.\nWisdom and strategy are not employed—\nits boundless virtue emerges without sound,\nas if lost yet still present,\nborrowing its radiance yet not dazzling—\nthus it seems like darkness.*\n\n*The Way is smooth like simplicity—*\n*Huizong’s Annotation:*\n*\"Though their paths differ, their destination is the same;\none principle governs a hundred deliberations.\"*\n\n*Exegesis:*\n*Smooth* means *easy*—easy is without peril.\n*Smooth* also means *constant*—constant is without change.\nIf there is no peril and no change,\nthen the Way is singular indeed—\nas the *Classic* says: *\"The Great Way is most easy.\"*\n\nThough the Way is singular,\nyet all things arise from it,\nall things move by it—\nas if not singular yet truly singular.\n\nFor when threads combine in purity,\nthey become without distinction,\ndistinction leads to separation and non-unity.\n\nThe Way’s application, though split into myriad branches,\nits return is the same;\nthough dispersed in myriad forms,\nits essence is singular—\nas the *Systematic Discourse* says:\n*\"Divergent paths yet the same return,\na hundred deliberations yet one principle.\"*\n\n*Advancing the Way is like retreat—*\n*Huizong’s Annotation:*\n*\"Yan Yuan used retreat as advancement,\nZhuangzi called it 'Sitting in Forgetting.'\"*\n\n*Exegesis:*\n*To study is to exhaust principle—*\nthus it is called *gain*.\n*To cultivate the Way is to deplete the self—*\nthus it is called *loss*.\nTo study and gain each day\nis to regard advancement as retreat.\nTo cultivate the Way and lose each day\nis to regard retreat as advancement.\n\nThe Master Kong praised Yanzi saying:\n*\"I see his advancement—\nI have not yet seen his cessation.\"*\nThus Yanzi had already advanced in the Way.\n\nYet at first he forgot benevolence and righteousness,\nthen he forgot ritual and music,\nand finally reached 'Sitting in Forgetting.'\nFrom his own account,\nit seemed like retreat—\nyet abandoning form and discarding wisdom,\nuniting with the Great Permeation,\nthis retreat was truly advancement.\n\nThus Yang Xiong said:\n*\"In ancient times, Yan Yuan used retreat as advancement—\nfew could match him,\nand Zhuangzi praised his 'Sitting in Forgetting.'\"*\n\n*The highest virtue is like a valley—*\n*Huizong’s Annotation:*\n*\"Empty yet responsive,\nresponsive yet inexhaustible,\nempty yet receptive,\nreceptive yet not hoarding.\"*\n\n*The Classic* says: *\"To be the valley of all under Heaven,\nconstant virtue is sufficient.\"*\n\n*Exegesis:*\nZhuangzi said: *\"Virtue encompasses the Way.\"*\nHe also said: *\"Virtue encompasses the Way’s singularity.\"*\n\nThe Way is neither in being nor in non-being,\nneither being nor non-being—\nonly emptiness.\nVirtue is likewise.\n\nThus like a valley’s emptiness yet responsiveness,\nresponsive yet inexhaustible—\nas the *Book of Documents* says: *\"If virtue is ample, the body is sufficient.\"*\nLike a valley’s emptiness yet receptivity,\nreceptive yet not hoarding—\nas Zhuangzi said: *\"Virtue contains nothing it does not embrace.\"*\n\n*The Classic* says: *\"To be the valley of all under Heaven,\nconstant virtue is sufficient.\"*\nIs this not so?\n\n*The most brilliant is like humiliation—\"*\n\n「The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"To purify and remove all obscurity, one sees no flaw—this is the state of great brightness. To dwell where others abhor, hence it appears as humiliation.\"*\n\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"The Classic states: ‘Bright and clear, penetrating and insightful.’ Zhuangzi said: ‘With this, one clarifies the heart.’ Thus, great brightness is the Way’s manifestation as flawless. How could one not see any flaw without purifying and removing external attachments, without possessing? How could one not recognize the profound and subtle principles without gazing into the depths and silently knowing them? Only when one is flawless can they stand apart from the common yet not be opposed by it, be an eccentric yet not be excluded by others—like water, dwelling where others abhor, hence it appears as humiliation. This is what Zhuangzi recorded of Laozi’s Dao/Way and techniques: ‘Know its brightness, preserve its humiliation.’*\n\n*\"Ample virtue appears insufficient—*\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Virtue is all-embracing yet does not consider itself excessive, hence it appears insufficient.\"*\n\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"The highest virtue does not claim virtue, hence it has virtue; the lowest virtue does not lose virtue, hence it lacks virtue. When virtue reaches the point of embracing all without exclusion, it is indeed broad. Yet if one considers it as having excess, then it is not broad. Only when one does not consider it as having excess, does its embrace of all become truly boundless. Thus, it appears as insufficient.*\n\n*\"The Autumn Waters rise in season, yet the River Warden is pleased—*\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"The River Warden, though pleased, is mocked by those of great insight, for he does not know the vastness of the Eastern Sea, believing all beauty to be within himself. This is how one who lacks virtue is laughed at by the wise.\"*\n\n*\"Established virtue appears as theft—*\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The Sage deliberates to act yet does not seek success. Though they act with deliberation, success is inevitable, yet this does not mean they seek it. Thus, their established virtue seems like theft, for they act without intent.\"*\n\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"The Sage’s engagement with the world is without contrivance. Only without contrivance can they act in matters of creation and enterprise, all arising from necessity—what Zhuangzi called ‘not compelled by necessity in affairs.’ Yet even emperors and kings achieve results without deliberate action. Though they deliberate to act, they do not aim for success, yet each action succeeds—this is their established virtue, seemingly like theft, for they act without intent.*\n\n*\"The *Analects* say: ‘If one does not abandon the old, the people will not be negligent.’ Negligence leads to superficiality and thinness, yet because they act without intent, it appears as theft.*\n\n*\"Pure essence seems like mud—*\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Should one not say: ‘Though polished, it does not gleam’? Though rubbed, it does not dull. Should one not say: ‘Though white, it is not stained’? Though dyed, it is not blackened.\"*\n\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"At first, cinnabar and mineral pigments are vivid, but over time, they fade—fading means change. The True Person’s application of the heart cuts off the root of benevolence yet does not wither it, enriches the source of wisdom yet restrains its expression. In their perception, there is no favoritism; in their hearing, no excess. Their *qi* is full yet without deficiency, finding their own fulfillment without relying on others. Though they distinguish themselves from things, they remain in true clarity while discerning illusion. Though they are stirred, they remain tranquil—this is what is meant by ‘Though polished, it does not gleam.’ Though rubbed, it does not dull.*\n\n*\"Immediate purity upon staining—*\n*This is what is meant by ‘Though white, it is not blackened.’ Thus, it appears as mud.*\n\n*\"The Great Square has no corners—*\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The Great Square is the square of the boundless. Though it has form, it does not sever, hence it has no corners.\"*\n\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"Yin perceives the Spirit’s presence in Yin yet not in Yang; Yang perceives the Spirit’s presence in Yang yet not in Yin. Yin and Yang are unfathomable, and the Spirit cannot be sought in any fixed form. Thus, in the realm of supreme clarity, at the origin of utmost Yang, entering the gate of profound obscurity, at the origin of utmost Yin—this is how the Way has form that can be pointed to. Though the Way has form that can be pointed to, it adapts flexibly to all things, leaving no trace of rigid distinction. It responds spontaneously without fixed patterns—this is the square of the boundless, differing from virtue that has corners. Hence, though it has form, it does not sever.*\n\n*\"The *Book of Odes* says: ‘Solemn and dignified, the bearing of virtue.’ Thus, virtue’s corners can be known. Zhuangzi said: ‘No gates, no sides—four-way openness, vast and boundless.’ Thus, the Way’s corners cannot be known. The great vessel takes time to mature—*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The great vessel is the vessel of the boundless. It neither adds to life nor aids in growth, hence it matures late.\"*\n\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"Where there is form, there is name; where there is division, there is limitation—this is the vessel. Yet there is a vessel that transcends form and enters awareness, creating shape while existing beyond measure, standing in the unfathomable, moving without trace, uniquely surpassing all images and precedents—this is the vessel of the boundless. The vessel of the boundless is the Way. The Way cannot be advanced abruptly, nor can one take it without following its natural progression. Hence, it matures late.*\n\n*\"Yang accumulates into heat, Yin accumulates into cold—*\n*This is not achieved in a single day. Could it be that one adds to life to bring about auspiciousness, or plucks the millet to aid its growth? The great sound is rare in voice—*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"It moves without form, yet responds when touched—hence its voice is rare.\"*\n\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"The source of sound is evident, yet the sound itself has never been emitted—this is what is meant by ‘sound is the great sound.’ Though the blind musician Jian was to listen all night with his head bowed and ears straining, he would not hear its voice, hence it is called rare. Rare implies a broad yet questioning resonance, not something heard by the ears—this is what Zhuangzi meant by ‘moving without form.’ Though unheard, its clarity and turbidity, high and low, shouts and sighs, all respond when touched, and the five tones cannot but resound in their proper order—this is sound, and it is indeed great. The Classic says: ‘Listening yet not hearing is called rare.’\"*\n\n*The Huainanzi* says: *\"There is no sound, yet the Five Tones resound within it. Is this not what is meant by the great sound that is rare in hearing?\"*\n\n*The Great Image is formless.*\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"It rests in the profound and obscure, yet when viewed, it cannot be seen—hence it is formless.\"*\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"That which shapes form is real, yet the shaping itself has never taken place—this is what is meant by the shaping that is the Great Image. Even if Li Zhu were to gaze at midday, wiping his eyes and raising his brows in expectation, he would not see its form, hence it is called the Great Image. For what is seen is called an image; yet when there is seeing, to say it is formless is to speak of the form that does not manifest. This is what Zhuangzi meant by dwelling in the profound and obscure. Though unseen, all things that have form arise from it—its role as an image is indeed great. The Classic says: ‘The image of the formless.’*\n*The Huainanzi* says: *\"There is no form, yet from it all forms arise. Is this not what is meant by the Great Image being formless?\"*\n\n*The Dao is hidden and nameless.*\nOnly the Dao is good at lending and completing.\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"From the Illuminated Dao to the Great Image, all are the Dao. The subtlety of the Dao cannot be sought with intellect nor pursued with form—it is hidden, and yet one cannot make it clear.\"*\n\nThe Sage attains the Dao, thus giving without depletion, responding without exhaustion, and completing all things without claiming possession—merely resting therein. The essence of the Dao is hidden in its namelessness, yet its function is to lend and complete effortlessly. Thus, with diligent practice, one arrives at the formless and rests in the untransformed. The remaining matters suffice for imperial governance. *The Transmission* says: *\"Learning begins with becoming a scholar and ends with becoming a Sage.\"*\n\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"The Dao is nowhere without being present, manifesting as essence when in essence, as function when in function—nameless and without substance, yet never separate from named and substantial things. Thus, from the Illuminated Dao to the Great Image, though their names differ, all are the Dao. Yet the utmost subtlety of the Dao is profound and obscure—though not separate from named things, it cannot be sought with intellect. The utmost extremity of the Dao is hazy and silent—though not separate from material things, it cannot be pursued with form. It is indeed hidden. Though one may force a name upon it, the original source of the Dao resists naming, for the Dao is hidden and nameless.\"*\n\nThe Sage attains the Dao, using ultimate emptiness to govern all things and ultimate substance to move all things. Thus, the more one gives to others, the more one possesses; the more one responds, the more one is fulfilled. As the foundation for all things and the reliance of transformation, the Sage rescues all without abandoning any, nurtures all without discarding any. When things come with sensation, the Sage aligns with them in natural harmony, yet never neglects; when things depart, the Sage rests with them in tranquility, yet never burdens. Those who dwell elsewhere take for themselves and receive, yet ultimately return to their origin. Those who dwell here achieve without taking, yet fundamentally incur no cost. All things—small or great—are completed in their proper measure, without claiming possession, simply resting therein.\n\nThe principles of the world: *\"The departing will depart, yet ultimately return; the deceased will die, yet ultimately revive.\"* The Dao lends to things, ending where it begins, ceasing yet never ending—hence it is called *qiě* (thus). The essence of the Dao is hidden in its namelessness, yet its function is to lend and complete effortlessly—this lies in diligent practice alone.\n\nIf one truly accumulates strength over time, one arrives at the formless and merges with the Dao, resting in the untransformed and enduring through ages eternal. The remaining matters suffice for governing the state and rectifying the world—its surplus is ample for imperial achievements. What is within us is not merely sufficient but abundant.\n\nThis section begins with the Superior Person hearing the Dao and practicing diligently, concluding that the Dao lends and completes effortlessly. Thus, from lower learning to higher attainment, those who excel as scholars all follow this path. Even Master Gu said: *\"Learning begins with becoming a scholar and ends with becoming a Sage.\"* This is what is meant.\n\n*End of Volume Eight of the Exegesis on the Dao De Jing*\n*Volume Nine of the Exegesis on the Dao De Jing*\n\n**Volume Nine of the Exegesis on the Dao De Jing (continued)**\n\n*Chapter 42: Dao Gives Rise to One*\n\n**Dao gives rise to One.**\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: At the beginning of all things, there is the indeterminate (無), which is nameless; this is where One originates.\nThe Exegesis states: There is the *Taiyi* (太易) and there is the *Tai’chu* (太初).\nThe *Taiyi* is the state before *qi* (氣) manifests.\nThe *Tai’chu* is the first emergence of *qi*.\nWhen it is called the *Tai’chu*, it is because it lies within the realm of the indistinct and formless, when the Dao transforms into *qi*—at that moment, not yet a single thing exists. Vast and empty, it is but indeterminate (無) alone. Thus, before the *Tai’chu*, there was nothing at all—this is the origin of indeterminacy (有無).\nAs Zhuangzi said, *\"indeterminacy\"* is what is called *wu* (無), for indeed, there was nothing.\nOnce it is said to be *wu* (無), then it is *wu’ming* (無名)—nameless.\nMoreover, Heaven has no fixed name for things; things arise and their names follow naturally. When their forms are complete and their numbers established, then their abundance or scarcity can be named.\nIn its state of *wu* (無), not yet a single thing exists, and not yet a single thing, then it is not something that can be sought through appearance, form, sound, or color. Who could name it?\nThe *Jing* (經) says, *\"The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\"* and again, *\"The Dao is ever nameless.\"*\nThus, the nameless indeterminacy (有無) is the essence of the Dao. The Dao’s essence is fundamentally indeterminate (無), yet it never neglects the determinate (有). Therefore, when it moves, it does not generate indeterminacy (無) but generates the determinate (有), manifesting its signs. When it shifts from indeterminacy to determinacy, numbers begin to establish themselves. Thus, the origin of One is rooted in the *Tai’chu*—this is the Dao descending and emerging.\nIf the Dao remains indeterminate (無), then it returns to the undifferentiated (浑沦), when *qi* has not yet appeared, and One cannot be obtained. This is what is meant by *\"At the beginning of all things, there is indeterminacy (有無), and indeterminacy is nameless (無名).\"* This is where One originates—just as Liezi said, *\"The easy transforms and becomes One.\"*\n\n**One gives rise to Two.**\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: Heaven is One, Earth is Two; water emerges, and fire follows; when the essence is complete, the spirit arises.\nThe Exegesis states: Heaven is noble, Earth is humble; *Yin* (乾) and *Kun* (坤) are thus defined, and so it is that there is Heaven and Earth, establishing differences between the high and low.\n*Yin* (乾) is Heaven, its number is odd.\n*Kun* (坤) is Earth, its number is paired.\nThus, the *Yijing* (易) refers to Heaven as One and Earth as Two. There is Heaven before there is Earth, and so Earth is Two following Heaven.\nWater is deep and empty; it takes form through the solid, and distinction comes later. It is represented in the *Hexagram* (卦) as *Kàn* (坎), which contains One. Hence, One is water.\nFire is restless and swift; it takes form through stillness, and unity comes later. It is represented in the *Hexagram* (卦) as *Lí* (離), which encompasses Two. Hence, Two is fire.\nFrom the Dao descending, water is nearly of the Dao, yet within water there is fire, succeeding in turn; thus, water is One, and fire is Two following it.\nHeaven, One, gives rise to water, which in things is the *jing* (精).\nEarth, Two, gives rise to fire, which in things is the *shen* (神).\nOnly the most refined essence in the world can become the most refined spirit in the world; thus, when a person is born, the *jing* (精) gathers the *shen* (神), and the body takes form.\nThe *jing* (精) is the foundation of the body; when the *jing* is complete, the *shen* reigns supreme. If one guards it and does not lose it, the *shen* and *jing* become one.\nTherefore, one who does not depart from the *jing* is called a *shen’ren* (神人)—this is what is meant by *\"when the essence is complete, the spirit arises.\"*\n\n**Two gives rise to Three.**\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: One combines with speech to become Two; Two combines with One to become Three.\nThe Exegesis states: Numbers begin with One, are established in Two, and completed in Three.\nOne is odd; alone, it does not generate.\nTwo is paired; alone, it does not complete.\nOne odd and One paired, and yet Three arises.\nWhen traced to its source, the Dao’s great origin is singular and without counterpart. Though myriad things exist, they are all of One with me.\nOnce it is called One, it cannot lack speech, so One is one thing, and speech is another thing—thus, One and speech become Two.\nOne is odd, Two is paired; odd and paired generate each other, so there is Two when there is Three—thus, Two and One become Three.\nFrom indeterminacy to determinacy, until it reaches Three, it is then gathered to extend toward the infinite—this is the natural progression of numbers, which cannot be altered.\n\n**Three gives rise to the myriad things.**\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: Heaven marks One at the North, Earth marks Two at the South, and the human takes form in Three. When the Three Principles are complete, the myriad phenomena are divided.\nThe myriad things are called \"ten thousand\" (万) by number; from this point onward, they cannot be counted exhaustively.\nThe Exegesis states: Once the undifferentiated is divided, the light and pure gather upward to form the *yang* (陽), and its number is odd, so Heaven marks One at the North.\nThe heavy and turbid descend and congeal to form the *yin* (陰), and its number is paired, so Earth marks Two at the South.\nYet Heaven governs the original *qi*, and Earth governs the original form; there must be one who governs the original awareness.\nHeaven’s role is to give birth and cover; Earth’s role is to bear and load; there must be one who takes charge of teaching and transforming.\nThus, Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the human takes form within them.\nWhen the Three Principles are complete, those rooted in Heaven belong to the high and associate upward—Heaven is clear and disperses.\nThose rooted in Earth belong to the low and associate downward—Earth is turbid and gathers.\nThe distinct clustering and separation of kinds, the varied states of flight, movement, plants, and growth—\nall arise in their ordered ranks, and the myriad phenomena are divided.\nCount all the myriad things in the world, and none do not arise from this; hence, the *Yijing* says, *\"Heaven and Earth exist, and then the myriad things are born.\"*\nFrom Three, the myriad things arise; from this point onward, even the most skilled cannot count them exhaustively.\nYet the myriad things are called \"ten thousand\" (万) because their multitude is named and spoken of—\nhow could one enumerate their teeming, tangled confusion? Can it be exhausted?\n\n**The myriad things bear *yin* and embrace *yang*, and the harmonizing *qi* unites them.**\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: *Yin* is still and quiet; the myriad things bear it, hence the Superior Person says, *\"Enter and rest.\"*\n*Yang* is fluid and accomplished; the myriad things embrace it, hence the Sage says, *\"Face the bright and govern.\"*\nThere must be the balance between *yin* and *yang*, and this is the harmonizing *qi*.\n\nZhuangzi says: *\"The utmost *yang* blazes resplendent; the utmost *yin* stands solemn and grave.*\n*Solemn and grave* issues from Heaven, while *resplendent* arises from Earth. The two interact to form harmony, and thus the myriad things are born.\"\n\n**Exegesis says:** The luminous function of Heaven, manifesting all things, is called *yang*; the obscure, formless, and unfathomable is called *yin*. *Yang* moves and emits, while *yin* remains still and contracts, hence *yin* is still and quiet. *Yang* warms and flourishes, while *yin* congeals and restrains, hence *yang* is fluid and accomplished.\n\nSince *yin* is still and quiet, the myriad things that follow in its wake—all that is born—bear *yin* and face north. Since *yang* is fluid and accomplished, the myriad things that precede it—all that is born—embrace *yang* and turn south.\n\nBecause the myriad things bear *yin*, the Superior Person follows the principle of *yin*, hence he retires at dusk to rest, for night is the peak of *yin*—as the *Yijing* says: *\"The Superior Person, at the approach of evening, enters to rest in repose.\"* Because the myriad things embrace *yang*, the Sage faces the bright and governs, for day is the peak of *yang*—as the *Analects* say: *\"With reverence and rectitude, he faces south.\"*\n\nWithout *yin* and *yang*, there would be no harmonizing *qi*. The harmonizing *qi* takes Heaven’s One as its root and Heaven’s Five as its pivot. Without the harmonizing *qi*, there would be no supreme harmony—harmony that does not lean toward *yang* nor cling to *yin*, but remains in the balance of *yin* and *yang*.\n\nZhuangzi says: *\"The utmost *yang* blazes resplendent; the utmost *yin* stands solemn and grave.\"* Indeed, *yang* is bright while *yin* is obscure; *resplendent* ascends to the heights of supreme luminosity, the origin of the utmost *yang*; *yang* gives birth while *yin* destroys—*solemn and grave* enters the gates of profound darkness, the origin of the utmost *yin*.\n\n*Solemn and grave* issues from Heaven, and Heaven’s *qi* descends; *resplendent* arises from Earth, and Earth’s *qi* ascends. Heaven and Earth intermingle in vaporous transformation, and the myriad things refine into purity. The two interact to form harmony, and thus the myriad things are born.\n\nYang Xiong also said: *\"Heaven and Earth interact, and the myriad things are born.\"*\n\nWhat people detest—being solitary, orphaned, and impoverished—is what kings and lords take as their title.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** Things that are not exalted do not perish; affairs that are not at their peak do not decline. This is the operation of *yin* and *yang*, the principle of all things.\n\nEbb and flow, fullness and emptiness, proceed together without losing harmony—this is the way of the Sage alone. Thus, though solitary, orphaned, and impoverished are what people detest, kings and lords take them as their title. When things reach their extreme, they return; when they are full, they diminish—this is how one remains above without peril.\n\n**Exegesis says:** When things ascend to their peak, they descend; hence the high are brought low. When things reach their fullness, they decline; hence the abundant are diminished. Whether refined into *yin* and *yang* or dispersed as affairs and things, none escape this law: things that are not exalted do not perish; affairs that are not at their peak do not decline. This is the operation of *yin* and *yang*, the principle of all things.\n\nThe Sage delves into origins and knows subtleties, thus he consumes when it is time to consume, rests when it is time to rest. He follows the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness, preserves the great harmony, and moves with the times without deviation. Hence, though solitary, orphaned, and impoverished are names of lowly things, he takes them as his title without shame.\n\nFor the trends of the world, extremes must necessarily decline, but he guards his attainment without loss, knowing when to return at the peak. Though fullness must inevitably overflow, he holds his abundance without excess, knowing when to diminish at the point of saturation. Thus does he long endure in wealth and nobility, remaining above without peril?\n\nTherefore, things may be diminished to benefit, or benefited to diminish. **Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** When trees shed their leaves, their roots are fertilized—thus, diminution brings benefit. When the moon is full, it must be eclipsed—thus, addition brings diminution. Heaven and Earth follow the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness; how much more so for humanity?\n\nThus, though solitary, orphaned, and impoverished are what people detest, kings and lords take them as their title. Though it seems self-diminishing, it is the way to achieve benefit and maintain noble elevation.\n\nWhat people teach is also what I teach. The overbearing and violent do not meet a good end. I shall make them my teaching father.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** To subdue the weak with strength, to conquer the gentle with rigidity—this is what people teach. What I teach is different.\n\nThe overbearing and violent have *yang* within them and love contention; thus, they have the way of death. The wise observe this and take it as a warning, hence I shall make them my teaching father.\n\n**Exegesis says:** In terms of affairs, the weak cannot resist the strong, nor can the gentle overcome the rigid—thus, to subdue the weak with strength, to conquer the gentle with rigidity, is what people teach.\n\nIn terms of the *Dao*, rigidity and strength dwell below, while gentleness and weakness dwell above—indeed, the gentle can overcome the rigid. If so, then my teaching is certainly different from that of others.\n\nThough my teaching differs from others’, what others teach is also my principle—only that what others teach pertains to affairs, while my teaching pertains to the *Dao*. Yet in using strength and weakness as lessons, they are one.\n\nFor the rigid and strong are doomed to perish, while the overbearing and violent have *yang* within them and love contention—thus, they have the way of death. The wise observe this and take it as a warning: *\"The wicked serve as a resource for the virtuous. When one sees the wicked, one must solemnly reflect upon oneself.\"*\n\n「Is this not the very principle of my teaching? *Chapter Forty-Three: The Supreme Gentleness of the World*\n\nThe supreme gentleness of the world can conquer the supreme rigidity of the world.\n\nThe *Huizong* annotation states: *\"The rigid will be destroyed, the sharp will be blunted. Only the Sage can accumulate the small to achieve the great victory.\"*\n\nThe *Shuyi* commentary explains: *\"The world has ways of constant victory and constant defeat. The way of constant victory lies in gentleness, while the way of constant defeat lies in rigidity.*\n\nIndeed, the way of constant victory lies in gentleness—this is why the ancient *Dao*’s true and magnanimous masters must embody meekness and humility as their outward expression.\n\nTo manifest as meek and humble, they root themselves in depth, having no need for rigidity, for rigidity invites destruction. They adhere to restraint, having no need for sharpness, for sharpness invites blunting. Thus, they do not engage with rigidity or sharpness, so others always take the lead, while they alone take the rear. Others always grasp what is solid, while they alone embrace what is empty. They yield to the overbearing and follow the winding paths of others, conforming to the flow of things like water in waves. In their emptiness and stillness, they never falter—this is what is meant by the supreme gentleness of the world.\n\nWhen it comes to governing all things and directing myriad movements, responding to the boundless, and drawing upon resources without depletion, turning the heavens and earth yet no one perceives its vigor, subduing the realm yet no one attributes it to force—this is also the supreme gentleness of the world, unstoppable in its conquest.\n\nZhuang Zhou’s discussion of accumulating small advantages to achieve great victory—only the Sage can do this—truly demonstrates profound insight into this principle.\n\nObserve the wind as it moves through the boundless void: it points at me and I conquer it; it adds to me and I conquer it. When it comes to stirring and swaying all things, none dare resist its command. Water, dwelling in gentleness, flows east when guided eastward, flows west when guided westward. Yet when it attacks rigidity and strength, none can precede it—this too exemplifies the idea of accumulating small to achieve great victory. Who would say the supreme gentleness of the world cannot conquer the supreme rigidity of the world?\n\nThere is no entering the boundless void.\n\nThe *Huizong* annotation states: *\"In the *Zhuangzi·Outer Chapters*, it discusses how the *Kui* snake and the wind and the eyes of the *Mu* target each other’s vulnerabilities, yet concludes with the eyes of the *Mu* targeting the heart. The foot’s movement is limited by distance, the eye’s sight by subtlety, but only the spirit is boundless in its reach.\"*\n\n*\"In the *Inner Chapters*, it speaks of the master of life-nurturing, and how much more so the butcher Ding’s art of dismembering an ox.\"*\n\n*\"Ding* is the yin aspect of fire and the manifestation of the spirit. Thus, his blade moves with ease, as if playing without effort.\"*\n\nIf so, then to enter the boundless void—is this not the domain of one who exhausts the formless and wanders without trace? Who else could grasp this?\n\nThe *Shuyi* commentary explains: *\"When things are constrained by form and *qi*, they are always limited by these very things. The *Kui* snake and the wind and the *Mu*’s eyes are each vulnerable in their own way, yet none can perceive the subtle, hidden movements of the great transformation, which unfolds silently in the depths, without action yet naturally so. They are enslaved by the craft of creation, yet cannot escape their inherent flaws or excesses.*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi·Outer Chapters* thus discusses how the *Kui* snake and the wind and the *Mu*’s eyes target each other’s vulnerabilities, yet concludes with the eyes of the *Mu* targeting the heart—all are constrained by their own limitations.\n\nThe foot’s movement is confined by near and far, its strength by reach; the eye’s gaze is limited by fine and coarse, its clarity by scope. But the spirit is profound and formless, its operations boundless—swift yet not hasty, reaching yet not forced. Its uses are wondrous, its transmission without limit, yet it never stagnates in form or body.\n\nThe spirit’s boundlessness is but emptiness itself. Through emptiness, it finds utility in both entering and exiting—thus, it is without limit and cannot be contained. Is this not precisely what is meant by having no entry into the boundless void?\n\nIn the *Inner Chapters*, it speaks of the master of life-nurturing, and how much more so the butcher Ding’s art of dismembering an ox. All things arise through their forms, yet the spirit governs them. The butcher’s task is to harmonize, thus nurturing life.\n\nThe earth gives birth to fire, which in humans becomes the spirit. *Ding*, the yin aspect of fire, is the manifestation of the spirit.\n\nWhen the spirit is employed, the butcher Ding’s art of dismembering an ox is realized. And when one encounters things with the spirit rather than the eye, halting the senses while the spirit acts freely—then the mind illuminates itself, and all *Dao*’s principles are attained. He splits great joints, guides great cavities, yet never falters, his blade moving with effortless grace. The ox is dismembered with ease, its pieces falling apart as if by themselves.\n\nEven the metaphor of the butcher’s blade—though thin and entering gaps—can still meet resistance. But what of one who has no form entering the boundless void? Then, the six orifices and four limbs are fully open, clear and penetrating, with no obstruction or hindrance at all. Only one who exhausts the formless, attains boundlessness, and leaves no trace of the *Dao* could achieve this.\n\nThus, one understands the benefits of *wuwei*—non-action.\n\nThe *Huizong* annotation states: *\"The gentleness overcomes rigidity, the void encompasses the having, and the wondrous uses of the *Dao* truly lie here. Abandoning action spares the body’s labor, neglecting life preserves the essence’s integrity—this is why it is beneficial.\"*\n\nThe *Shuyi* commentary explains: *\"The *Dao* is ever in non-action yet never fails to act. Non-action is the true, still essence of the *Dao*, unmoving in its nature. Never failing to act is the wondrous operation of the *Dao*, responding to all things without effort.\n\nOnly in its non-action yet never failing to act does the *Dao* achieve victory through gentleness, and encompass the having through the void. Its wondrous uses truly lie here.\n\nGentleness overcoming rigidity—this is what is meant by accumulating in gentleness to achieve rigidity. The void encompassing the having—this is what is meant by non-action generating the void, and the void giving birth to the having.\n\nIts uses are thus wondrous—how could one delight in forced action and labor? The operations of the *Dao* are measured and harmonious, emerging and responding as needed. Though myriad transformations arise, the principle of non-action remains unchanged.\n\nIf non-action is embraced, what need is there to abandon action? Why should one labor in vain?」\n\n**生奚足遗？**\nWhy should life be abandoned?\n\n**弃事则形不劳而全，遗生则精不亏而复。**\nTo abandon worldly affairs preserves the body unwearied and whole, while to abandon life exhausts the vital essence and leaves it depleted.\n\n**形全精复，与天为一，则其有益孰大於是？**\nWhen the body is whole and the essence restored, one aligns with the Heavenly Way—what greater benefit could there be?\n\n**不言之教，无为之益，天下希及之矣。**\nThe teaching of non-speech, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain to these.\n\n**徽宗注曰：**\n*The Emperor Huizong’s annotation:*\n**不言之教，设之以神；**\nThe teaching of non-speech is established through the numinous.\n\n**无为之益，不亏其真。**\nThe benefit of non-action does not diminish its authenticity.\n\n**圣人以此抱朴而天下宾，无为而万物化，故及之者希。**\nThe Sage embraces simplicity and thus the world comes as guest; through non-action, all things transform—few attain to this.\n\n**疏义曰：**\n*Explanatory commentary:*\n**言有当愆，孰若不言之教？**\nWhen words falter, what surpasses the teaching of non-speech?\n\n**妙通心术而设之以神，《易》所谓以神道设教，而天下服者，此也。**\nTo subtly penetrate the mind’s workings and establish it through the numinous—this is what the *Yijing* means by teaching through the Way of the numinous, thereby winning the world’s submission.\n\n**为有成亏，孰若无为之益？**\nAction brings completion and loss—what surpasses the benefit of non-action?\n\n**得於自然而不亏其真，庄子所谓无益损乎其真者，此也。**\nTo gain from spontaneity without diminishing authenticity—this is what Zhuangzi meant by not harming one’s true nature.\n\n**盖天地有大美而不言，则知不言之教固神矣。**\nHeaven and Earth possess supreme beauty yet speak not—thus the teaching of non-speech is indeed numinous.\n\n**天地以无为而清宁，则知无为之益固真矣。**\nHeaven and Earth achieve tranquility through non-action—thus the benefit of non-action is indeed authentic.\n\n**圣人以天地为宗，故以此抱朴而天下宾，无为而万物化。**\nThe Sage takes Heaven and Earth as model, thus embracing simplicity and welcoming the world, acting in non-action while all things transform.\n\n**朴者，道之全体，惟道能总摄群有，所谓守小朴而物自宾也。**\nSimplicity is the complete essence of the *Dao*; only the *Dao* can encompass all things—this is what is meant by preserving the small simplicity and letting things come as guests.\n\n**无为者，道之自然，惟道能干旋化枢，所谓我无为而民自化也。**\nNon-action is the *Dao*’s spontaneity; only the *Dao* can pivot and transform the world—this is what is meant by my non-action while the people spontaneously transform.\n\n**然则不言之教，无为之益，非体无尽道者不能知此。**\nThus, the teaching of non-speech and the benefit of non-action—only those who embody the boundless *Dao* can comprehend these.\n\n**圣人者道之极，故天下希及之。**\n\n*The Sage is the pinnacle of the Dao—few in the world attain to this.*\n\n---\n**名与身章第四十四**\n\n**名与身孰亲？**\nBetween name and body, which is closer?\n\n**身与货孰多？**\nBetween body and wealth, which is greater?\n\n**徽宗注曰：**\n*The Emperor Huizong’s annotation:*\n**两臂重於天下，则名与身孰亲？**\nIf two arms weigh heavier than the world, then between name and body, which is closer?\n\n**生者岂特隋珠之重哉，则身与货孰多？**\nIf life is not merely as precious as the Duke of Sui’s pearl, then between body and wealth, which is greater?\n\n**至愿在我，名非所亲也；**\nWhen ultimate desire resides within, name is not what is cherished.\n\n**至富在我，货非所多也。**\nWhen ultimate abundance resides within, wealth is not what is excessive.\n\n**惟不知亲疏多寡之辨，而残生损性，以身为徇，若伯夷死名于首阳之下，盗跖死利于东陵之上，岂不惑哉。**\nOnly those who fail to discern closeness, distance, abundance, or scarcity will harm life and diminish nature, sacrificing the body for name—as Bo Yi starved to death for reputation beneath Chief Yang’s slopes, or Zhi the Robber died for gain at Dongling’s heights—how bewildered they are!\n\n**达生之情，而不务生之所无以为，此有道者之所以异乎俗也。**\nTo understand life’s essence and not pursue what life cannot provide—this is how the Daoist differs from the common.\n\n**疏义曰：**\n*Explanatory commentary:*\n**务内观者取足於身，诚其身者真乐内融，则一身之中，众美咸具，何往而不自适。**\nThose who cultivate inner observation find sufficiency in the body; those who sincerely embody it experience true joy within—thus within one body, all virtues are complete, and where could one not find self-contentment?\n\n**世之昧者，不能定乎内外之分，辨乎真伪之归，乃矜搅外务，见得忘形，汲汲於名，以危其身，殊不知两臂重於天下，身亦重於两臂，名与身孰亲？**\nThe ignorant of the world cannot distinguish between inner and outer, nor discern true from false—thus they boast of external affairs, seeing gain while forgetting the body, eagerly pursuing name and endangering themselves. How could they know that two arms weigh heavier than the world, and the body heavier than two arms? Between name and body, which is closer?\n\n**孳孳为利，以害其生，殊不知生固重於隋侯之珠，利固轻於千仞之雀，身与货孰多？**\nStriving ceaselessly for profit harms life—how could they know that life is heavier than the Duke of Sui’s pearl, and profit lighter than a thousand *ren* sparrow? Between body and wealth, which is greater?\n\n**惟不介意於傥来而以守身为本，然后能自适其性分，以道为重矣。**\nOnly by not fixating on transient gains and taking body-preservation as foundation can one naturally align with one’s nature and hold the *Dao* as paramount.\n\n**列御寇居郑圃四十年，人无识者，未闻其干於名。**\nLie Yukou dwelled in Zheng’s fields for forty years; no one recognized him, nor did he seek fame.\n\n**颜回乐箪瓢陋巷，人不堪其忧，未闻其累於货。**\nYan Hui took joy in a gourd and bowl in a humble lane; though others could not endure his poverty, he was never burdened by wealth.\n\n**所重者，道而已。**\nWhat they valued was the *Dao* alone.\n\n**是以至愿名誉并焉，至富国财并焉。**\nThus, ultimate desire encompasses both name and reputation, while ultimate abundance encompasses both state and wealth.\n\n**至愿在我，则不急於人知，名非所亲也。**\nWhen ultimate desire resides within, one is not hasty for others’ recognition—name is not what is cherished.\n\n**至富在我，则万物皆备，货非所多也。**\nWhen ultimate abundance resides within, all things are complete—wealth is not what is excessive.\n\n**於此而不能明亲疏多寡之辨，其为智亦疏矣。**\nTo fail to discern closeness, distance, abundance, or scarcity here—such wisdom is indeed coarse.\n\n**故有见生於可欲，乃残生伤性，以身为徇而忘其真，如伯夷见名之可欲，饿于首阳之下是也，盗跖见利之可欲，暴于束陵之上是也，此皆昧於至理，惑而不能解也。**\nThus, when life is seen as desirable, one harms life and injures nature, sacrificing the body while forgetting its true essence—as Bo Yi, seeing name as desirable, starved beneath Chief Yang’s slopes, or Zhi the Robber, seeing profit as desirable, perished at Shulei’s heights. These are all ignorant of ultimate truth, bewildered and unable to awaken.\n\n**惟达生之情，不务生之所无以为。**\nOnly by understanding life’s essence and not pursuing what life cannot provide—\n\n**生之所无以为者，非生之所待而生也，此有道者所以能保身全生而异於世俗者欤？**\nWhat life cannot provide is not what sustains life—this is how the Daoist preserves the body and ensures life while differing from the common.\n\n**得与亡孰病？**\nBetween gain and loss, which is more harmful?\n\n**徽宗注曰：**\n*The Emperor Huizong’s annotation:*\n**烈士徇名，食夫徇利，其所得者，名与货，而其亡也，乃无名之朴，不赀之躯，病孰甚焉？**\nThe heroic sacrifice name, the gluttonous sacrifice profit—what they gain is name and wealth, yet what they lose is nameless simplicity and a body without treasure. Which is more harmful?\n\n**疏义曰：**\n*Explanatory commentary:*\n**求诸性分之内者，有益於得；**\nTo seek within one’s nature’s scope benefits gain;\n\n**求诸性分之外者，无益於得。**\nTo seek beyond one’s nature’s scope benefits

insufficient.\n\n**夫惟不足，故烈士徇名，则累於名高而不知名公器也，不可多取。**\nIt is because of insufficiency that the heroic sacrifice name, burdened by high reputation, fail to recognize that name is a public instrument, not to be hoarded.\n\n**黄夫徇利，则累於利厚而不知货恶其弃於地也，不必为己。**\nThe gluttonous sacrifice profit, burdened by excessive gain, fail to recognize that wealth is detestable when abandoned on the ground, not to be hoarded for oneself.\n\n**盖万物之理相为消长，有得则亡或继之，故诸所病。**\nFor the principles of all things involve mutual growth and decline—gain is often followed by loss, hence the afflictions.\n\n**然其得之也，是岂真得之哉？**\nYet what they gain—is this truly gain?\n\n**名与货皆傥来之寄耳，寄之其来不可图，其去不可止。**\nName and wealth are but transient lodgings—when they come, one cannot foresee them; when they depart, one cannot stop them.\n\n**而其亡也，乃至於损德塞性，苦身疾作，丧无名之朴而失其至真，忘不赀之躯而舍其至贵，则其病大矣。**\nYet what they lose is to damage virtue and obstruct nature, toil the body and hasten illness, to abandon nameless simplicity and lose its utmost authenticity, to forget the priceless body and forsake its utmost worth—then their affliction is great indeed.\n\n**是故甚爱必大费，多藏必厚亡。**\nThus, excessive love brings great expenditure, and excessive hoarding brings great loss.\n\n「黄夫慕外，则累於利而忘其真；徇物过度，则损德而失其至。 无慕於外，则心固而不费；无累於物，则性全而不失。\n\n**徽宗注曰：无慕於外，则啬而不费。**\n*Emperor Huizong’s annotation:* Without coveting the external, one becomes frugal yet unspent.\n\n**无累於物，则守而不失。**\nWithout being burdened by things, one preserves yet does not lose.\n\n**取予之相权，积散之相代，其至可必，若循环然，岂可长久。**\nThe interplay of taking and giving, of accumulation and dispersal, is certain in its unfolding—like the cycles of nature, how can it endure long?\n\n**疏义曰：重内而不重外，然后能无慕於外；**\n*The Explanatory Commentary:* To value the inner while not the outer—only then can one avoid coveting the external;\n\n**见性而不见物，然后能无累於物。**\nTo perceive nature while not seeing things—only then can one avoid being burdened by them.\n\n**不生外慕，则无多欲之逐，故啬而不费，非至於甚爱必大费者也。**\nWithout external craving, there is no pursuit of excessive desires, hence frugality yet no waste—this is not the case where extreme love brings great expenditure.\n\n**不为物累，则无食积之忧，故守而不失，非至於多藏必厚亡者也。**\nWithout being burdened by things, there is no anxiety from overindulgence, hence preservation yet no loss—this is not the case where excessive hoarding brings great ruin.\n\n**虽然利之在天下，民咸用之，无所不通，有取斯有予，其出入常相权，有积斯有散，其盈虚常相代，乃必至之理。**\nThough benefit pervades the world, all people employ it, and it flows everywhere—there is taking, then there is giving; its ebb and flow are ever balanced, its fullness and emptiness ever alternate—this is the inevitable Dao.\n\n**势若循环之不能自已，又乌可恃为长久而认为己有哉？**\nIts momentum is like the unceasing cycles of nature—how then can one arrogantly claim it as one’s own enduring possession?\n\n**虽执之使留，且自冥冥中去矣，惜夫世俗莫之悟。**\nThough one clings to it to make it stay, it departs from the unseen depths—alas, the common folk do not comprehend this.\n\n**经曰：金玉满堂，莫之能守。**\n*The Classic says:* Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can keep them.\n\n**知足不辱，**\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace,\n\n**徽宗注曰：处乎不淫之度，何辱之有？**\n*Emperor Huizong’s annotation:* To abide in the measure of non-excess, what disgrace can there be?\n\n**疏义曰：一性之真，万善充足，道之尊，德之贵，莫之爵而常自然。**\n*The Explanatory Commentary:* The singular truth of nature suffuses all virtues—its Dao is exalted, its virtue/power noble, yet it requires no titles and remains ever spontaneous.\n\n**不假势物而无所歉，则亦处乎不淫之度而已。**\nWithout relying on external things, lacking nothing, one simply abides in the measure of non-excess.\n\n**盖不淫之度者，不皦不昧，适与之当而不过也。**\nFor the measure of non-excess is neither excessive nor deficient—it harmonizes with the appropriate and does not overstep.\n\n**以此安其性命之情，则真君高世，良贵在我。**\nBy this, one settles the sentiments of life and nature—then the True Sovereign transcends the world, and true nobility resides within oneself.\n\n**所以为义荣者，物无以尚之，又何辱之有哉？**\nThus, what is deemed honorable in virtue is beyond comparison with worldly things—what disgrace can there be?\n\n**知止不殆，**\nKnowing cessation brings no peril,\n\n**徽宗注曰：游乎万物之所终始，故无危殆之患。**\n*Emperor Huizong’s annotation:* To wander in the ultimate origins and endings of all things—thus, no peril of danger befalls.\n\n**疏义曰：域於流动之机者，一息不停。**\n*The Explanatory Commentary:* Bound within the mechanism of flux, it never ceases for a moment.\n\n**固有默使之者，若有机缄而不得已，其运转而不能自止。**\nThere is an unseen force that governs it—like hidden springs that cannot be restrained, its motion turns yet cannot be halted.\n\n**虽行之於无止，而不知有真止者。**\nThough it moves without end, one does not know of true cessation.\n\n**存势物之徒，不能徐观一性，镒渊静不迁之宗，乃与物为偶，相刃相靡，**\nThose who cling to transient things cannot leisurely observe the singular nature—*the Dao of the boundless depths, tranquil and unchanging*—instead, they align with things, clashing and eroding like blades.\n\n**其行尽如驰而莫之能止，且将菁然痕役而不知其所归，岂不危其身耶？**\nTheir actions rush like galloping steeds, unable to be stopped, yet they labor in vain and do not know their end—does this not peril their very being?\n\n**真人则不然，超然独立乎形器之上，与造物者进，与无终始者为友，**\n*The True Person* is otherwise—transcending and standing alone above form and matter, advancing with the Creator, consorting with the Eternal.\n\n**盖将造乎不形而止乎无所化，故能游乎万物之所终始，虚静之中默与道会，**\nFor they craft the formless and cease at the unchanging—thus, they wander in the ultimate origins and endings of all things, and in emptiness and tranquility, silently converge with the Dao.\n\n**其天守全，其神无却，物无自入而莫之能伤，又何危殆之患哉？**\nTheir natural defenses are intact, their spirit unobstructed—things cannot intrude of their own accord, nor cause harm—what peril of danger can there be?\n\n**老氏於道常无名亦曰知止所以不殆，盖非通乎物之所造者，不能与此。**\n*Master Laozi* speaks of the Dao as ever nameless, yet also calls it knowing cessation so as not to perish—only those who penetrate the mechanisms of things can align with this.\n\n**可以长久。**\nThus, it can endure eternally.\n\n**徽宗注曰：物有聚散，性无古今，世之人以物易性，故好名而徇利，**\n*Emperor Huizong’s annotation:* Things gather and disperse, yet nature knows no past or future—the people of the world mistake things for nature, hence they pursue fame and yield to profit,\n\n**名辱而身危。**\nFame brings disgrace, and the body faces peril.\n\n**圣人尽性而足，天下至大也，而不以害其生，故可以长久而与天地并。**\nThe Sage fulfills nature and finds sufficiency—this is the utmost greatness under heaven—yet does not harm their life, thus they can endure eternally alongside Heaven and Earth.\n\n**疏义曰：即理以观物，则无常之分，有积有做。**\n*The Explanatory Commentary:* To perceive things through the Dao of transformation, one sees their impermanent nature—there is accumulation, then there is dispersal.\n\n**即妙以观性，则真常湛专，无古无今。**\nTo perceive nature through its subtlety, one beholds its eternal truth—unmoved, undivided, without past or future.\n\n**以性逐物则性与物俱驰，以性辨物则物无自而入。**\nTo chase things with nature is for nature and things to rush together; to discern things through nature is for things to have no power to intrude.\n\n**世之人昧於至理，驰其形性，港之万物，以易所固有，**\nThe people of the world are blind to ultimate truth—they exhaust their form and nature, ensnared by all things, replacing what they inherently possess,\n\n**於是好名者困於志，徇利者忘其真，**\nThus, those who love fame are ensnared by ambition, and those who yield to profit forget their true essence,\n\n**至於名辱而罔觉，身危而莫顾，交战於利害之域，何可长也。**\nTo the point where fame brings disgrace yet they remain unaware, their body faces peril yet they do not heed—engaged in battle within the realm of profit and harm, how can they endure long?\n\n**圣人尽性而足，故能贵爱其身，不以害其生，**\nThe Sage fulfills nature and finds sufficiency, hence they cherish and esteem their body, not harming their life—\n\n**三万岁而一成纯，与天地相为长久。**\nThree ten-thousands of years pass in perfect unity, enduring alongside Heaven and Earth.\n\n**大成若缺，其用不弊。**\n*Great Completion, though seemingly incomplete*—its application is without exhaustion.\n\n**徽宗注曰：域中有四大，道居一焉。**\n*Emperor Huizong’s annotation:* Within the realm are the Four Great Elements, yet the Dao dwells in unity among them.\n\n**体道之全，故可洛於大。**\nTo embody the Dao in its entirety—thus, one can dwell in the great.\n\n**无成与亏，是谓大成。**\nWithout completion or deficiency, this is called *Great Completion*.\n\n**不有其成，故若缺。**\nWithout its outward completion, it seems incomplete.\n\n**知化合变，而不以故自持，故其用不弊。**\nTo know the transformations of change yet not cling rigidly to any fixed form—thus, its application is without depletion.\n\n**此孔子所以集大成而为圣之时。**\nThis is how Confucius gathered *Great Completion* and became Sage.\n\n**疏义曰：道未始有封，强为之名曰大。**\n*The Explanatory Commentary:* The Dao has never been confined—yet it is named the \"Great\" by convention.\n\n**既谓之大，则未离方体，寓於域中，而居四大之一焉。**\nThough called \"Great,\" it remains within the square and round, dwelling in the realm as one of the Four Great Elements.\n\n**盖道覆载万物者也，天无不覆，地无不载，**\nFor the Dao is the one that encompasses and nurtures all things—Heaven covers nothing it does not, Earth bears nothing it does not,\n\n**圣人位乎两间，体道之全以配天地，故皆名於大。**\nThe Sage stands between Heaven and Earth, embodying the Dao fully to harmonize with them—thus, they are named the \"Great.\"\n\n**则其由是道以出应天下，**\nThen, through this Dao, they emerge to respond to the world,\n\n**天造地设，发越显着，以彰制作之妙，其成也可谓大矣。**\nHeaven and Earth crafting, their expression surpassing and manifest—thus, their completion can be called *Great*.\n\n**然而道无成亏，乌至而倪小大？**\nYet the Dao knows no completion or deficiency—how can one measure it as small or great?\n\n**世之人徒知圣人以道之绪余土直致天下之大利，**\nThe people of the world merely know that the Sage employs the remnants of the Dao to directly achieve the world’s greatest benefits,\n\n**成天下之大顺，丰功茂烈，巍乎其成，**\nCompleting the world’s grand harmony, with abundant achievements and towering accomplishments—majestic in their completion,\n\n**而不知道之妙用，本於精神心术之微。**\nYet they do not perceive the Dao’s subtle applications, rooted in the essence of spirit and the refinement of heart-mind.\n\n**果且有成与亏乎哉？**\nDoes it truly have completion or deficiency?\n\n**果且无成与亏乎哉？**\nDoes it truly lack completion and deficiency?\n\n**惟其无成与亏，所以谓之大成。」**\nOnly because it lacks completion and deficiency is it called *Great Completion*.\n\nThe principles of all things reach their peak and then decay—\nwhen deeds are accomplished, they return in cycles;\nwhen names are attained, they incur loss.\nOnly by not clinging to completion can one achieve it without decay.\n\nThus, the divine person has no deeds—\nnot because they lack deeds, but because they do not dwell on them when accomplished;\nthe Sage has no name—\nnot because they lack a name, but because they do not rely on it when attained.\nBy abandoning deeds and names and returning them to the common people,\nthey are called *as if incomplete*.\n\n*Great Completion* is *as if incomplete*—\nnot only does it not cling to its own completion,\nbut it also reveals its understanding of transformation and adaptation,\nwithout rigidly adhering to the old ways.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Those who know the Dao of transformation—\ndo they not know the workings of the numinous?\"*\n\nThe numinous has no fixed form—\nwithout fixed form, it transforms and nurtures to exhaust its changes,\nand through change, it harmonizes to exhaust its benefits.\nHow could it be bound by the old and constant,\nunable to adapt to the ebb and flow?\n\nThus, its use is inexhaustible.\n\nConfucius gathered the essence of *clearing, harmonizing, and fulfilling*—\nthe very moment of his sagehood—\nand this is why he attained it.\n\nTo *gather completion* is to strike like metal and resonate like jade—\nto strike like metal is to begin with order;\nto resonate like jade is to perfect that order.\n\nThe three Sages’ established ways—\nthis is what is meant by *resonating like jade*.\nTo hold fast to one principle without change\nis only to achieve its end.\n\nBut when one strikes like metal and resonates like jade,\nit is because they understand transformation and adaptation—\nthus able to complete both beginning and end.\nHence, it is said: *Great indeed is Confucius.*\n\n*Great fullness is as if empty*—\nits use is boundless.\n\nThe *Commentary of Xiuzong* says:\n*\"Filling all without limit, suffusing all existence—\nthis is great fullness.\nEmpty to respond to things, void yet applied—\nthus its giving never ceases, its use is boundless.\nA wise merchant hides his wealth as if empty,\nand great virtue appears as if simple.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"The true essence of the Dao encompasses the six extremes,\nvast yet containing all things without trace.\nThe subtle applications of the Dao flow through the six voids,\nbroad yet reaching everywhere without obstruction.\nThe Sage, attaining the Dao’s completeness,\nfills all without limit, covering all things unseen,\nsuffusing all existence, animating the masses—\nyet those who seek it find it inexhaustible,\nits fullness so profound it cannot be measured.\nYet if fullness cannot yield to emptiness,\nit cannot respond to things.\nOnly by the Dao’s emptiness meeting all things\ncan one apply it like a deep spring, flowing as needed.\n\nThus, filling it does not overflow,\ndrawing from it does not deplete,\ngiving it does not exhaust—\nthe more one gives to others, the more one possesses;\nthe more one shares, the more one has.\nIts use is boundless—\nhence, *great fullness is as if empty*.\n\nThough it has accumulation, it is insufficient.\nThough it has no hoarding, it overflows.\nThe perfected one has no accumulation—\nonly emptiness—\nthus those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\n\nA wise merchant hides his wealth as if empty,\ngreat virtue appears as if simple—\nthis is why Laozi spoke thus to Confucius.\n\nTo have as if not having,\nto be real as if empty—\nthis is the scholar’s ultimate endeavor,\njust as the wise merchant hides his wealth.\n\n*Great whiteness is as if stained*,\ngreat virtue appears insufficient—\nhere lies the Sage’s emptiness and the gentleman’s demeanor.\n\nFrom this, one can infer:\n*Great fullness is as if empty*.\n\n*Great straightness is as if bent*—\nThe *Commentary of Xiuzong* says:\n*\"Following things’ transformations, yielding and winding,\nnot forcing one’s will—\nthus it appears bent.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"The Sage empties themselves to move through the world,\nadapting to every situation—\nnowhere does this fail to be straight,\nfor it follows things’ transformations.\nThus, winding yet unharmed,\ncurving yet unerring,\nyielding to strength, following turns—\nnever rigidly self-assertive.\nThough winding and turning,\nits alignment is beyond control—\nthis is *great straightness*, appearing bent.\n\nIt is said, *not forcing one’s will*—\nthis is the meaning, is it not?\n\nZhuangzi in *Human World* says:\n*'The inwardly straight align with Heaven,\nthe outwardly curved align with humanity.'*\nFor the world of humanity is to respond to others.\nIf inwardly aligned with humanity,\none cannot stand apart—\nthus, outwardly curved—\nand *great straightness is as if bent* becomes clear.*\n\n*Great skill is as if clumsy*—\nThe *Commentary of Xiuzong* says:\n*\"Shaping things’ forms—\nround, square, curved, straight—\ntheir artistry unseen,\nthus it appears clumsy.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"The Sage’s ultimate emptiness fulfills all demands,\nyet their skill is hidden—\nlike Nature shaping forms without effort.\nThus, round and square yet bound by compass and square,\ncurved and straight yet never straying from the plumb line—\nforms manifest, colors shine,\nyet no trace of the true master remains.\nThough round, square, curved, or straight,\neach exhausts its art—\nyet *great skill* is beyond measure.\nIt is said, *their artistry unseen*—\nthis is the meaning, is it not?\n\nZhuangzi in *Great Master* says:\n*'Treading Heaven and Earth,\ncarving all forms—\nyet not considered skilled.'*\nFor the *Great Master* is the source of all things.\nSince all things take their source,\nthey give birth without possession—\nthus, not considered skilled—\nand *great skill is as if clumsy* becomes clear.*\n\n*Great eloquence is as if inarticulate*—\nThe *Commentary of Xiuzong* says:\n*\"Speech without words—\nthis is called great eloquence.\nHui Shi’s many arguments—\nhis skill is small indeed.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"Utmost speech transcends speech,\nachieved through forgetting speech—\nthen one attains speech’s perfection.\nThe demand is for *eloquence without words*—\nis this not the meaning of ultimate speech?\n\nZhuangzi says:\n*'Great eloquence does not utter a single word.'\"*\n\n「Indeed, only by not speaking does one achieve *great eloquence*.\nThe Sage does not take *skill in argument* as true ability;\ndeeply cultivating the silent understanding,\nwhere ultimate truth is preserved,\none illuminates without words,\nrequiring no aid from mere vocal sounds—\nthus, it seems *as if clumsy*.\nHui Shi’s many arguments\nare but the narrow confines of a skilled debater,\nbranching and convoluted yet failing to grasp the essence—\nhow could they ever speak of the *extreme*?\nHis *Dao* is flawed, and his words never harmonize;\nhe contradicts without purity,\nyet claims his eloquence is vast—\nhis labor is no greater than a gnat’s or a horsefly’s,\nso his *eloquence is small indeed*.\nWho knows the *eloquence without words*?\n\n*Agitation overcomes cold*,\n*tranquility overcomes heat*,\nyet *serene stillness* is the true rectitude for all under Heaven.\n\nXiuzong’s *Commentary* says:\n*\"Yang’s movement brings agitation,\nthus it overcomes cold.\nYin’s restraint brings tranquility,\nthus it overcomes heat.\nBoth extremes lean toward Yang or Yin,\nyet neither aligns with the *Middle*—\none is already ensnared by things,\nalready embroiled in strife with movement—\nhow could they ever rectify all under Heaven?\nOnly by abandoning agitation that overcomes cold,\nand tranquility that overcomes heat,\ndoes one remain untainted and clear—\nembracing the *Spirit* in stillness,\nthen all under Heaven will naturally find rectitude.\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"All things bear Yin yet embrace Yang,\nand the *intermingling qi* harmonizes them.\nHumans receive the *central qi* of Heaven and Earth,\nand inherit the *intermingling qi* of their balance.\nWhen one moves, agitation arises—\nit issues from Yang,\nand its heat is like blazing fire,\nthus it overcomes cold.\nWhen one ceases, stillness arises—\nit settles in Yin,\nand its cold is like frozen ice,\nthus it overcomes heat.\nSince both extremes suffer from Yang or Yin’s afflictions,\none clings to Yang in joy,\nand to Yin in anger,\nyet neither finds satisfaction in the *Middle*—\nthis is not the *Dao* of *‘moving yet all in accord’*.\nIf so, one is already ensnared by things,\nsinking into the realm of chaotic flux,\nalready embroiled in strife with movement—\nwaging war in the paths of gain and loss,\nwhere Yang and Yin become bandits,\nand thus cannot rectify all under Heaven.\nOnly by abandoning agitation that overcomes cold,\nand ensuring Yang does not disperse,\nand tranquility that overcomes heat,\nand ensuring Yin does not grow dense,\ncan one achieve *serene stillness* as the true rectitude for all under Heaven.\nFor *untainted clarity* is the utmost of *‘pure and serene’*,\nas in *‘how clear it is’*!\nTo *embrace the Spirit* in stillness\nis the utmost of *‘serene stillness’*,\nas in *‘motionless and tranquil’*!\nIf one must be tranquil and clear,\nthen the *form* is upright and its *shadow* must be straight—\nall under Heaven will not *await* rectitude,\nyet rectitude will naturally arise.\nLaozi, speaking of the *Dao*’s *non-action*, also says:\n*‘By not desiring, one attains tranquility,\nthen all under Heaven will naturally find rectitude.’*\nTo call this *non-action*,\nit is but *‘dull and unadorned’*—\nseeking agitation that overcomes cold,\nor tranquility that overcomes heat,\nthere is none indeed.\n\n**Chapter 46: The Way of the World**\n\nWhen the *Dao/Way* prevails in the world,\nwarhorses are turned back to manure the fields.\n\nXiuzong’s *Commentary* says:\n*\"Those who govern the world with the *Dao*\nlet the people each take joy in their occupations,\nwith no strife—\nthey merely manure their fields.\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"When the *Dao* is practiced in the world,\nthe people do not *corrupt* their nature;\nwhen the world is *nurtured* with the *Dao*,\nthe people do not *shift* their virtue.\nIf the people do not *corrupt* their

occupation,\nwith no boasting or coveting of others’ desires.\nThey but exert themselves in their roots,\ntoil in the southern fields,\nand manure their plots—\neven if they possess swift horses that chase the wind or lightning,\nthey will turn them back and not use them—\nonly those who know the *Dao* of the world can understand this.\n\nWhen the *Dao* does not prevail in the world,\nwarhorses are born in the suburbs.\n\nXiuzong’s *Commentary* says:\n*\"The strong oppress the weak,\nthe many tyrannize the few—\neven borders cannot be upheld.\"\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"How can humans gather in groups? By *division*.\nHow can *division* be implemented? By *righteousness*.\n*Righteousness* with *division* brings harmony,\nand harmony brings unity.\nGroups without *division* lead to strife,\nand strife brings chaos.\nThe strong rely on force,\nsometimes even oppressing the weak.\nThe many rely on numbers,\nsometimes even tyrannizing the few.\nThey fight over land,\nkilling until the fields are filled—\nwarhorses are born in the suburbs,\nand borders cannot be upheld—\nthis is because they do not know\nto govern the world with the *Dao*.\"\n\nNo greater crime exists than *desiring what is forbidden*—\nXiuzong’s *Commentary* says:\n*\"If one does not see what is forbidden to desire,\nthe heart will not be disordered.\nHuman desires can reach the point\nwhere they endanger life and virtue to contest them—\nthis is where crime begins.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"The heart is naturally pure and clear,\nyet desires do not sprout without provocation.\nThings entice from without,\nand emotions give rise to desires.\nThe *will* is the *qi*’s leader,\nand *qi* is the *body*’s fulfillment.\nIf one uses the *will* to command the *qi*,\nand engages with things without restraint,\nthen the *qi* will grow exhausted,\nand the heart will begin to disorder.\nThus, if one does not see what is forbidden to desire,\nthe heart will not be disordered.\nThe ignorant masses are unaware of this.\nThose burdened by fame will see the *desire for reputation*,\nand those burdened by profit will see the *desire for gain*—\nstruggles of gain and loss wage war in the breast,\nreaching the point where they endanger

contentment*—\nXiuzong’s *Commentary* says:\n*\"Moderation brings blessing,\nexcess brings calamity.\nKnowing contentment brings no shame—\nwhat calamity could there be?\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"When Yang is bright and clear, the state of Jin is rich—*this* brings blessing.\nWhen Yin is dark and obscured, the state of Zhou retreats—*this* brings calamity.\nThus, blessing thrives in *‘spreading’*,\nwhile calamity arises in *‘withdrawing’*.\nYet blessing and calamity are neighbors,\nand calamity and blessing rely on each other—\nso moderation brings blessing,\nwhile excess brings calamity.\nThe *Classics* say:\n*‘No blessing is greater than having no calamity.’*\nThis is why.\nIf one does not know contentment\nand strives for ever more gain,\nthen even noble families will have *spirits* lurking in their halls—\nwhat calamity is greater than this?\nOnly by abiding in the *measure of non-corruption*\ndoes one know contentment without shame—\nwhat calamity could there be?\"\n\nNo greater fault exists than *desiring to obtain*—\nXiuzong’s *Commentary* says:\n*\"To desire and then obtain\nis what people blame.\"*」\n\nAs the valley empties and responds,\nit responds yet does not cling.\nThe one who follows the Dao is not without desire—\ndesire lies in *not* indulging it.\n\nIf one exchanges oneself for things,\nsees gain and forgets form,\nand cannot let public virtue overcome private desire,\nthis is what people reject—\nwhat greater fault is there?\n\nThus, the sufficiency of *knowing sufficiency*\nis always sufficient.\n\nXiuzong’s *Commentary* says:\n*\"When people see what is desirable,\nthey do not know sufficiency.\nNot knowing sufficiency leads to desiring to obtain,\nand desiring to obtain sparks contention—\ncalamity and chaos arise,\neven to the point where warhorses march at the city’s gates.\n\nYet if one knows sufficiency\nand each abides in their nature’s allotted portion,\napplying no cleverness or artifice—\nmerely using food and drink—\nwhat contention could there be?\"*\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven: Not Leaving the Door**\n\nNot leaving the door, one knows the world;\nnot peering through the window, one sees the Way of Heaven.\n\nXiuzong’s *Commentary* says:\n*\"Though the world is vast, the Sage knows it through wisdom;\nthough the Way of Heaven is distant, the Sage perceives it with the heart.\nWisdom encompasses all things—\nnothing is too far to examine—\nso there is no need to leave the door.\nThe heart, subtle in its divine clarity,\npenetrates even the most hidden—\nso there is no need to peer through the window.\nZhuangzi said:\n‘His swiftness between bowing and raising\nreaches twice beyond the four seas.’\nThis is how the Sage operates secretly and transforms alone.\"*\n\n*Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"Though the multitude of living beings is vast\nand worldly affairs are complex,\nthe world, though great, cannot hide its nature—\nthis is ‘knowing it through wisdom,’\nfor one discerns it by principle.\nThe Way of Heaven is boundless and formless—\nyet if one gazes at the formless,\nthe Way of Heaven, though distant, shares its mystery—\nthis is ‘seeing it with the heart,’\nfor one perceives it in its intangibility.\nThe Dao descends and gives rise to wisdom;\nthe Dao ascends and gives rise to spirit.\nWisdom and spirit are one—\nthe Sage’s spirit, boundless in its operation,\nenters and exits without limit,\nso wisdom and spirit together\ncan encompass all things—\nthough distant as the eight extremes,\nnothing escapes their grasp.\nHow could one need to leave the door to know the world?\nZhuangzi said:\n‘Great wisdom observes the distant;\nnear wisdom encompasses all things.’\nThe Dao-heart is subtle—\ngrasping it is impossible—\nit permeates Heaven and permeates Earth,\nso the heart unites with the Dao.\nThe Dao’s great root precedes Heaven and Earth,\nmoving yet accumulating nothing—\nthe heart, empty and gathering the Dao,\nthus subtly manifests the divine—\nthough hidden in the formless,\nnothing remains unseen.\nHow could one need to peer through the window to see the Way of Heaven?\nYang Xiong said:\n‘Heaven and Earth are divine yet unfathomable,\nyet the heart’s subtlety would fathom them—\nthis is how it is.’\n\nThough one’s perception is boundless,\nwisdom is great;\nthough one’s insight penetrates the hidden,\nthe heart

changes\nhave no end.\nThe Six Perfections and Four Openings\nare all within them.\nTheir mysterious operation begins here—\nthis is why the Sage, as Zhuangzi said,\ndiscusses the human heart’s swiftness between bowing and raising,\nreaching twice beyond the four seas—\nonly through such transformation could this be possible.\nThus the Sage operates secretly and transforms alone.\n\nThe *Liezi* says:\n‘The skilled transformer’s Dao is subtle yet harmonious in agreement.\nSubtle operation reveals the mystery of transformation,\nas if a true sovereign moves without trace;\nthe foundation of solitary transformation\nis like motion yet unable to stop itself.\nFrom this, we see:\nThe Sage does not leave the door to know the world,\nnor peer through the window to see the Way of Heaven—\nhow could this merely be attained through clever reasoning or subtle techniques?\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.’*\n\nXiuzong’s *Commentary* says:\n*\"Does this mean one has glimpsed the heart of Heaven and Earth?\nTaking from the near—within the body—\nall principles are complete.\nSeeking in yin and yang, in measurements,\none only drifts farther from the Dao,\nknowing less and less.\"*\n\n*Explanatory Notes* say:\n*The *Yijing* speaks of *‘seeing the emotions of Heaven and Earth’* in *Great Strength*\nand *‘seeing the heart of Heaven and Earth’* in *Repetition*.\n*Great Strength* is vast yet interacts with things;\n*Repetition* is subtle yet distinguishes itself from things.\nOnly because it distinguishes itself from things\ndoes it, when all things act together,\nfollow the path of emergence and return.\nI observe that movement must return to stillness,\nand emergence must return to repetition—\nthus, I perceive the heart of Heaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth are too vast to measure in an instant,\nbut if one makes the heart empty,\nmerging it with the boundless,\nthen the heart of Heaven and Earth *is* my heart.\nWhat makes *Repetition* noble\nis its stillness, not its movement and emergence.\"*\n\n「Just by observing this, one realizes that the Dao/Way is near at hand and need not be sought from afar—\nit is sufficient to take it from oneself.\n\nWithin a single body, all things are fully present;\none who practices inner observation finds everything already complete—\nthe most profound traces of the universe are all here.\n\nIf one can attain emptiness, hold fast to stillness,\nand gather them together with the mind,\nthen the Dao/Way will dwell within you—\nwhy wait to seek it far away?\n\nTo seek it through *yin-yang* (阴阳),\nthe Dao/Way may never leave *yin-yang*,\nyet *yin-yang* cannot fully contain it;\nto seek it through *measurements and calculations* (度数),\nthe Dao/Way may be abundant in *measurements and calculations*,\nyet *measurements and calculations* cannot exhaust it.\n\nSome may take five years yet fail to grasp it,\nothers twelve years yet still not attain it—\nthe farther one strays from the Dao/Way,\nthe less one truly knows.\n\nThe Dao/Way is like a great road,\nbright and easily seen—\nhow difficult can it be to know?\nThe trouble lies only in not seeking it.\n\nIf one turns inward to seek within oneself,\nthen without form, the mind becomes complete—\none will advance beyond the mere breadth of knowledge,\nand what fear is there of knowing too little?\n\nThus, the Sage does not act yet knows,\ndoes not look yet names,\ndoes not do yet achieves.\nEmperor *Huìzōng* (徽宗) commented:\n*With my understanding, I know the world—*\nthis is called *not acting yet knowing* (不行而知).\n*With the mind of the Five, I perceive the Dao/Way—*\nthis is called *not looking yet naming* (不见而名).\nIf one *does not act yet knows*,\nand *does not look yet names*,\nthen what need is there for action?\nThe Sage stands firm, and success comes naturally—\nthis is called *not doing yet achieving* (不为而成).\n\nThe *Commentary* says:\n*To act and then know—*\nthe places one’s feet reach are near,\nand one cannot perceive what lies far;\n*to see and then name—*\nwhat the eyes can grasp is shallow,\nand one cannot illuminate what is hidden.\nOnly by *knowing the world with my understanding*\ncan one transcend and recognize the distant—\nsufficient to penetrate the principles of the world,\neven without stepping outside one’s door,\nthis is called *not acting yet knowing*.\nOnly by *perceiving the Dao/Way with my mind*\ncan one gaze deeply into the mysteries—\nsufficient to explore the subtleties of the Dao/Way,\neven without peering through a window,\nthis is called *not looking yet naming*.\nIf one *does not act yet knows*,\nand *does not look yet names*,\nthen the vastness of the world,\nthe remoteness of the Dao/Way,\nhave never been a concern—\none follows nature effortlessly, without favor or bias,\ndiscarding knowledge and artifice while aligning with the natural order—\nwhat need is there for action?\n\nBy dwelling in *non-action* (无为之事),\nthe world will naturally achieve its functions,\nthus the Sage skillfully employs subtle methods\nand alone attains the clarity of the *Zhāokuàng* (昭旷).\nThis is indeed the Dao/Way of their own.\n\nThe world cannot grasp or know it—\nperhaps they only see the Sage’s firm success.\n\nDid *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) not say:\n*The Emperor-King achieves without action,\nand the world is transformed*—\nis this not the meaning of *not doing yet achieving*?\n\n*Chapter Forty-Eight: The Daily Progress of Learning*\n*Learning is a daily advancement,*」\n\n「The Emperor Huizong annotates: *Learning seeks to attain the Dao/Way*, beginning with the cultivation of the scholar and culminating in the perfection of the Sage. With daily progress, the Dao accumulates within oneself. Confucius spoke to Yan Yuan, saying: *\"I see his advancement.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* (疏义) explains: *The Dao cannot be directly attained, yet there are things said to be attainable—only learning can achieve this.* Indeed, learning encompasses both the *Tian Dao* (天道, Heavenly Dao) and the *Ren Dao* (人道, Human Dao). One cultivates the desired virtues until they reach the ineffable divine, and practices filial piety until it manifests as the Sage’s Heavenly Dao—this is what the *Yǔ* (语) refers to as *\"the scholar attains the Dao through learning,\"* and what *Mòzǐ* (苟子) means by *\"beginning as a scholar, ending as a Sage.\"* Only when one earnestly pursues learning will they see daily gains and forget their past ignorance, monthly progress and retain their acquired knowledge. Though daily calculations may seem insufficient, yearly reflections will yield abundance, and the Dao will naturally reside within you. This is truly *\"daily advancement, the Dao accumulating within oneself.\"*\n\nYan’s son knew to emulate the lofty virtue of the *Jian Gao* (坚高), yet forgot the labor of striving upward. When asked about *ren* (仁), he diligently sought to practice it, and upon hearing its merits, he wholeheartedly embraced them without hesitation. Thus, Confucius said of him: *\"Daily I see his advancement.\"* Is this not fitting?\n\n*The Dao/Way is attained through daily diminishment.*\nThe Emperor Huizong annotates: *To attain the Dao is to abandon one’s physical form, discard sharp intellect, sever from the body and forget worldly affairs—thus it is called \"diminishment.\"*\n\n*Lian Boyu* (连伯玉) reached sixty years and yet transformed sixty times. The *Cushui* explains: *If one knows that the body is not truly one’s own possession but merely a borrowed shape from Heaven and Earth, then they will not be burdened by the body and thus abandon physical form.* If one understands that their lifespan is finite while knowledge is boundless, then they will not cling to cleverness and thus discard sharp intellect. By severing from the body, the body cannot hinder; by forgetting worldly knowledge, the mind is unconstrained. Neither internal fluctuations nor external conformity exist—when engaged in affairs, not a single hair’s worth is spared, yet all worldly concerns vanish. Thus, it is called *\"diminishment.\"*\n\n*Zhuāngzǐ* said: *\"Lian Boyu reached sixty years and yet transformed sixty times.\"* This means that with each passing year, he underwent transformation until, at sixty, he had transformed sixty times—truly one who forgets the passage of years and aligns with the natural *Hua* (化, transformation) of humanity.\n\nObserving Lian Boyu’s conduct, it is clear that the Master wished to minimize his faults yet could not fully achieve it—thus, *\"reaching sixty years and yet transforming sixty times\"* is understandable.\n\n*Diminish again, and again diminish,* until one attains *non-action* (无为) yet *achieves all* (无不为).\n\nThe Emperor Huizong annotates: *Learning exhausts principles and encompasses all things; the Dao fulfills one’s nature and reaches the ineffable.* To diminish again and again is to arrive at *non-being* (未始有). *Non-being* is *non-action*. In stillness, one remains unmoved—this is *non-action*. Yet one responds to all things and naturally harmonizes with the world’s patterns—this is *achieving all*.\n\n*To attain stillness within oneself is the Dao of inner Sagehood; to act and engage with the world is the work of outer Kingship.* Both originate from this principle, hence *Zhuāngzǐ* says: *\"Stillness leads to Sagehood, movement leads to Kingship.\"* This is followed by *non-action* (无为) to achieve *Zhēn* (尊, reverence).\n\nThus, those who take possession of the world often rely on *non-action* (无事). But once they engage in worldly affairs, they are no longer sufficient to possess the world.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong annotates: *The world is a great thing. Those who possess great things cannot be possessed by them; if one is possessed by things yet transcends them, then they can possess all things.* Those who take possession of the world often rely on *non-action*—this is clear.\n\n*The world is a divine instrument; it cannot be forced.* Those who force it ruin it, and those who cling to it lose it. Hence, once they engage in worldly affairs, they are no longer sufficient to possess the world.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao’s truth to govern themselves. The rise of an Emperor-King and the establishment of a King’s realm both occur when they respond to necessity. Even if they forget the world, the world will naturally submit to them—just as *Tàiwáng Zhí Fù* (太王直父) avoided harm from the *Dí* (狄) people, did not let nourishment injure his life, nor let profit burden his form, and thus established his kingdom beneath the *Qíshān* (岐山).\n\nThe *Cushui* explains: *If one is confined by things, there must be something beyond them to govern them. If one is enslaved by instruments, there must be something beyond instruments to command them.* Though the *Liùhé* (六合, the six directions—Heaven, Earth, and the four cardinal points) may seem vast, they are still confined by things. What transcends them is the Dao. Though instruments may seem powerful, they are still enslaved by them. What transcends instruments is the Dao. To embody the Dao is to have no worldly affairs—thus, their use of the world is abundant. This is what *Zhuāngzǐ* meant by *\"the world is a great thing; those who possess great things cannot be possessed by them, yet they possess all things.\"* Hence, it is clear that those who take possession of the world often rely on *non-action*.\n\nIf one does not embody the Dao, they will cling to affairs and thus be insufficient in their use of the world. The *Classics* say: *\"The world is a divine instrument; it cannot be forced. Those who force it ruin it, and those who cling to it lose it.\"* This is the case.\n\nThe Sage governs themselves with the truth of the Dao. The rise of an Emperor-King and the establishment of a King’s realm both occur when they respond to necessity. Even if they forget the world, the world will naturally submit to them—just as *Tàiwáng Zhí Fù* did not let nourishment injure his life, nor let profit burden his form, and thus avoided the *Dí* (狄) people’s calamity, establishing his kingdom beneath the *Qíshān*.\n\n*End of Volume Nine of the *Zhēn Dàodé* (真道德) Annotated Classic.*\n*Beginning of Volume Ten of the *Zhēn Dàodé* (真道德) Annotated Classic.*」\n\n**Volume Ten of the *Zhēn Dàodé* (真道德) Annotated Classic**\n\n**Commentary by the Scholar Jiang Cheng on Chapter Forty-Nine: \"The Sage Has No Fixed Heart\"**\n\nThe Sage has no fixed heart, yet takes the hearts of the people as their own.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: The heart of the Sage is the luminous reflection of all things.\n\nEmpty yet able to receive, still yet able to respond—\nlike a mirror reflecting forms, taking all their beauty and ugliness,\nlike a valley echoing sounds, embracing all their vastness and minuteness—\nhow could there be a fixed heart?\n\nThe commentary observes all things and knows their nature,\nfollowing the people and nothing more.\nThis is what is meant by \"taking the hearts of the people as their own.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: The lowly cannot be ignored, for they are the people.\n\nThe commentary explains: The heart is empty and unified, still and responsive.\nOnly emptiness can give rise to substance,\nonly stillness can embrace movement.\nEmptiness and stillness are the root of all things.\n\nThe Sage penetrates the truth of all things and upholds their root,\nthus encompassing all without discrimination,\nand perceiving the four quarters with luminous knowledge.\nZhuangzi speaks of the Sage’s heart as the luminous reflection of all things,\nmeaning that emptiness allows for reception,\nstillness allows for response—\nthus, there is no fixed heart.\n\nIt is like a mirror:\nnot inclining nor welcoming,\nyet all beauty and ugliness are revealed,\nno preference nor selection made.\n\nIt is like a valley:\nreceiving and responding,\nall vastness and minuteness arrive,\nno rejection nor favor—\nhow could there be a fixed heart?\n\nThough the *Yì* warns against establishing a heart that does not waver (*wùdài*), and Mencius says that not wavering over one’s possessions is a virtue, the Sage here speaks of no wavering heart—why?\n\nThe Dao’s meaning is that wavering arises from clinging to change,\nwhile the Sage’s \"no fixed heart\" is not the same as the *Yì*’s warning against wavering.\nThe commentary observes all things and knows their nature,\nfollowing the people and nothing more—\nthus, their \"no fixed heart\" is the very means by which they attain true constancy.\n\nBeholding the Way of Heaven,\nits seeing and hearing come from the people,\nits wisdom and awe come from the people—\nfor it has no heart of its own.\n\nThe Sage has no heart,\nonly aligning with Heaven—\nthus Zhuangzi says: The lowly cannot be ignored, for they are the people.\n\nThe virtuous, I treat as virtuous;\nthe non-virtuous, I also treat as virtuous—\nthen virtue is complete.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nthe untrustworthy, I also trust—\nthen trust is complete.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: The virtuous and non-virtuous contradict each other,\nthe sincere and insincere mock each other—\ncommon people’s emotions naturally create distinctions of good and bad,\ntruth and falsehood. How could this be virtue?\n\nVirtue as virtue reveals that all actions are without exception virtuous,\nso even the non-virtuous are treated as virtuous;\nvirtue as trust reveals that all emotions are without exception trustworthy,\nso even the untrustworthy are treated as trustworthy.\nTrue and false are both forgotten,\nright and wrong are unified—\nthis is the person of complete virtue.\n\nThis is how Shun regarded the *Xiàng* (象),\nsincerely trusting and rejoicing in it,\nnot regarding it as false—\nthus the Sage does not distinguish between truth and falsehood.\n\nWhile the Sage is in the world, their words are but clamor,\nyet they muddy the hearts of the people.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: When in the world,\nthe Sage shares in the people’s joys and sorrows,\neven if they have no fixed heart,\nthey cannot fail to take heed.\n\nThus, in governing themselves,\nthey are cautious and vigilant,\nnever at ease or idle.\nIn governing the world,\nthey equalize virtue and non-virtue,\nunify trust and insincerity,\nforgetting praise and blame,\nand blending all into one.\n\nThe commentary explains: Knowing this and discerning it is how the Sage governs themselves;\nawakening to this and merging with it is how the Sage governs others.\n\nThus, they demand much of themselves with thoroughness,\nyet treat others with lightness and restraint.\nWhen in the world,\nthey are ever watchful,\nsharing in the people’s joys and sorrows,\ncautious and vigilant in their warnings,\ndiligent in their prudence—\nthough they have no fixed heart,\nthey dare not neglect it.\nThus, even in rest, they are not at rest,\ncautious and vigilant, never idle.\n\nWhen governing the world,\nthey respond to all things,\nmerging beauty with ugliness,\ncommitting right and wrong to their proper courses,\nequalizing virtue and non-virtue,\nunifying trust and insincerity,\nembracing all the strange and wondrous—\nthe Dao flows as one,\nand they forget praise and blame,\nmerging all into simplicity.\n\nThe people all focus their ears and eyes upon them,\nyet the Sage treats them as children.\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: Heaven’s vision comes from the people’s vision,\nHeaven’s hearing comes from the people’s hearing—\nthus the Sage takes the people as their heart.\nThe Sage acts, and all things observe them—\nthus the people all focus their ears and eyes upon them.\nThe people rely solely on the Sage’s vision and hearing,\nso the Sage is the parent of the people.\n\nWith tender care and compassion,\nlike protecting an infant,\nthey cover all beneath Heaven with benevolence.\n\nThe commentary explains: Though Heaven is high, its oversight is humble;\nthough Heaven is distant, its scrutiny is near—\nfor the Way of Heaven has no heart,\nonly taking all things as its heart.\n\nThus, the Sage never uses their own eyes,\nyet through the people’s vision sees all things—\nnever uses their own ears,\nyet through the people’s hearing hears all things.\nOnly Heaven is clear and wise,\nonly the Sage is timely and authoritative,\nyet they simply take the people’s heart as their own heart.\n\nTaking the people’s heart as their own heart,\nthey harbor no private thoughts yet grasp the people’s hearts,\nso their actions are manifest—\nlike the great sun rising in the east,\nthose with eyes and limbs await its light to complete their tasks.\nWho among the people would not focus their ears and eyes upon it?\nThis is what the *Yijing* says:\n*\"The Sage acts, and all things observe them.\"*\n\nThe Great Vision is above,\nwhile the lower vision brings forth transformation—\nthey observe the rites and respond,\nthey listen to the songs and move accordingly,\nso the people rely solely on the Sage’s vision and hearing.\n\nThe Sage, as the parent of the people,\ntreats them with love, fearing only that it may not be sufficient,\nand protects them, fearing only that they may be harmed—\nnurturing and fostering them,\nguarding and sustaining them,\ntheir virtue is profound indeed.\n\nYet the Sage’s care for the people\nis not limited to that of a parent,\nso their tender compassion and protective embrace,\nlike shielding an infant,\ncannot be exhausted.\n\nThe Sage’s governance and transformation\ncover all beneath Heaven—\nthis is why.\n\n**Chapter Fifty: Life and Death**\n\nLife and death,\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nAll things emerge from the *machine* and return to the *machine*.\nWhen Heaven’s *machine* expands, life begins;\nwhen Heaven’s *machine* contracts, death ends.\nThe living are the initial workings of *Zao-hua*,\nthe dead are the transformations of *Yin-Yang*.\n\nThe commentary explains:\nThere is no motion without something arising,\nnor anything lasting without returning to nothingness—\nthe interplay of existence and nonexistence\nis like a mechanism that cannot act of its own accord.\n\nAll distinctions of kind and group,\nall variations in movement and stillness,\nare thus governed by this principle—\nso all things emerge from the *machine* and return to the *machine*.\n\nMoreover, when things arise,\nthey do so swiftly and with urgency,\nwithout motion that does not alter,\nnor time that does not pass.\nFrom nonexistence to existence,\nthen the *void* transforms into *spirit*,\n*spirit* into *qi*,\n*qi* into *form*—\nHeaven’s *machine* expands, and with it life begins.\n\nFrom existence back to nonexistence,\nthen *form* transforms into *qi*,\n*qi* into *spirit*,\n*spirit* into *void*—\nHeaven’s *machine* contracts, and with it death ends.\n\nYet life is the beginning of death,\nand death is the completion of life—\nwhat dies here may yet live there,\nfor life and death are inconstant,\nand none know their measure.\nThus, the living are the initial workings of *Zao-hua*,\nand the dead are the transformations of *Yin-Yang*.\n\nThe initial workings of *Zao-hua* are called *refined qi forming matter*,\nthe transformations of *Yin-Yang* are called *wandering souls*.\n\nThose who follow life are thirteen in kind,\nthose who follow death are thirteen in kind.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nThose who follow life and death\nare bound by the mechanisms of emergence and return,\nand thus cannot escape their fate.\n\nThe commentary explains:\nWhen the Great Dao is obscured,\nit splits into many paths.\nThose who delight in life are burdened by form,\nyet they do not realize that the body is not their own—\nthey are ensnared by the Dao’s motion,\nleaning on the force of *Yin-Yang* to become followers of life.\n\nThose who seek stillness forget their bodies,\nyet they do not grasp the form of non-form—\nthey are drowned in the Dao’s tranquility,\nhalted in decay, and become followers of death.\n\nTo follow life and death,\none is already confined to the mechanisms of emergence and return,\nand thus cannot escape the bonds of life and death—\nboth are incomplete aspects of the Dao.\n\nThe numbers begin at One,\nare established at Two,\nand perfected at Three.\nHeaven and Earth combine to form Ten,\nso Three is the completion of numbers,\nand Ten is their fullness.\n\nThose who follow life and death\npursue their own desires,\nestablishing their own methods,\nand using numbers to justify them—\nthus, in their Ten, they attain only Three,\nfor those confined to the mechanisms of emergence and return\ncannot fully escape the cycles of *Yin-Yang*.\n\nThe people’s lives,\nwhen they stir toward death’s domain, are also thirteen in kind.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nThey blame fate while abandoning principle,\nforget life while pursuing gain—\nwhen the people’s lives stir toward death’s domain,\nwhat choice is there between life and death?\n\nThe commentary explains:\nLife is not my own,\nso those who blame fate are wrong.\nThus, those who understand the nature of life\ndo not labor for what life cannot provide—\nif one even blames fate while abandoning principle,\nthere are those who retain their form yet lose their life.\n\nLife is the radiance of virtue,\nso those who forget life are also wrong.\nThus, those who honor life\ndo not burden their bodies with profit—\nif one even forgets life while pursuing gain,\nthere are those with excess yet whose bodies are not nourished.\n\nThe common people are deeply confused and foolish,\nnot enlightened nor discerning—\nthey stumble blindly forward,\nfloundering in their vitality,\nrevering those who cherish life with great depth yet unaware of abandoning it,\nforgetting life while harming their nature, yet unaware of preserving it,\nseeking alms from the kitchen and begging at the walls—\nthey stir toward death’s domain,\nthough their forms may not yet perish, their hearts are already dead.\n\nZhuangzi called them *Xiao-ren*,\nYangzi called them *Ye-ren*—\nthese are they.\n\nThough they are called \"not dead,\" what benefit is it?\nThen their lives, what choice is there between life and death?\n\nWhy so?\nBecause of their excessive attachment to life.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nThose who follow life delight in life yet burden their forms,\nthose who follow death seek stillness yet forget their bodies.\nWhen they stir toward death’s domain,\nthe crippled and the lame are everywhere,\nand the prisons and punishments are in sight—\nthese are all those who do not know\nthat the body is a great affliction,\nthat life is limited,\nand who err in their excessive reverence for living.\n\nThe ancient ones who attained the Dao\ndid not let wealth and honor harm their bodies,\nnor did poverty and lowliness burden them with gain—\nthey did not rejoice in longevity,\nnor lament in early death,\nthey awoke to solitude and saw the One,\nthus they could transcend past and present\nand enter the realm of neither life nor death.\n\nThe commentary explains:\nThe Dao is not made clear\nbecause the wise overreach it,\nand the unworthy fall short.\nThose who follow life and death,\nthe wise are those who overreach,\nand the unworthy are those who fall short—\nthose who stir toward death’s domain\nare the unworthy who fall short.\n\nThose who cling to life are drowned in the delusion of what compels them,\nunable to forget the years and lose themselves,\never rejoicing in life while burdening their forms.\n\nThose who cling to death are blinded by the notion of nothingness,\nunable to cherish life while preserving their forms,\never turning toward emptiness and forgetting the body.\n\nThe debates of these two schools\neach grasp one side—\nexamining them to their own liking,\nthough they do not encompass all,\nthey are but one-sided scholars,\nthus they cannot instill fear in the people.\n\nThose who court death’s domain\nare akin to those who fail to nurture life.\n\nFor those who suffer internal punishments,\nthe yin and yang energies harm them;\nfor those who suffer external punishments,\nmetal and wood weapons assail them.\n\nOnly those who flee external punishments\nare the ones who face the gallows in succession,\nwho fill the prisons in sight,\nand who fall into the nets of crime in great numbers—\nthese are all those who do not know\nthat the body is a great exhaustion,\nthat life is limited,\nand who cling too deeply to living.\n\nThe ancient ones who attained the Dao were different from these:\nthey knew that things abound while the form does not sustain them,\nthus wealth and honor did not harm life through excessive nourishment—\ndifferent from those who devour life while defying nature;\nthey knew that the form does not perish while life fades,\nthus poverty and lowliness did not burden the form with gain—\ndifferent from those who forget life while pursuing profit.\n\nThey knew of that which is neither ever dead nor ever born,\nthus they did not rejoice in longevity nor align with those who cling to life;\nthey knew that what endures in me is unforgotten,\nthus they did not lament early death nor align with those who cling to death.\n\nWith insight clear and vision penetrating,\nthey stand alone above all things,\nnothing can pair with them—\nthey exist before Heaven and Earth without beginning,\nafter Heaven and Earth without end,\nspanning antiquity and the present while ever enduring.\nHow could this be the excessive reverence for life?\n\nAs Zhuangzi said:\n*\"Awakening to solitude and seeing the One,\nthus they could transcend past and present\nand enter the realm of neither life nor death.\"*\nThis is how they attained it.\n\nIt is said that those who master nurturing life\nwalk on land without fear of rhinoceros or tiger,\nenter battle without armor or weapons.\n\nThe rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horn,\nthe tiger has no place to strike with its claws,\nweapons have no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this?\nBecause they have no place of death.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n\nThose who master nurturing life preserve their form intact and restore their essence, uniting with the Dao and thus safeguarding their natural defenses. Their spirit is unshaken, their hidden movements unimpeded, their tread upon fire unburning, their passage above all things unperturbed. Thus, they trample upon creatures without breaking, and none can harm them.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"To traverse the Dao of day and night,\nand enter the mechanisms of life and death—\nthis is the way of all things.\"*\n\nTo know the teachings of death and life,\nand transcend the creations of things—\nthis is the realm of the Perfect Sage alone.\n\nThe *Cishu* explains:\n*\"To exist in the formless yet know the form’s formlessness—\nthus the form remains whole.\nTo unsettle not the essence yet refine it ever deeper—\nthus the essence is restored.*\n\nWhen form is whole and unharmed,\nand essence is restored and unlost,\nthen they abandon human contrivance\nand align with the natural Dao.\nHow could one know that Heaven is not human,\nor human is not Heaven?\nIndeed, they unite with the Dao.\n\nThus, they attain completeness from Heaven,\nand their natural defenses remain whole.\nTheir spirit is unshaken,\ntheir hidden movements unimpeded—\nsolid things cannot obstruct them,\nfire cannot burn them,\ntheir passage above all things is unperturbed—\nheight cannot endanger them,\nand the terrors of death and life do not enter their hearts.\nThus, they trample upon creatures without fear,\nand none can harm them.\n\nTherefore, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tiger,\nand wild beasts cannot harm them.\nThey do not wear armor or wield weapons,\nand blades have no place to strike them—\nthis is indeed the realm of no-death.\"\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"To traverse the Dao of day and night,\nand know the alternating dark and bright.\nDay and night succeed one another,\nembracing yin and cradling yang,\nbound by the mechanisms of emergence and return—\nnone can escape this.*\n\nLike the owl, bright in night and dim in day,\nor the kestrel, bright in day and dim in night—\nthis is not because day and night differ in nature,\nbut because they fail to traverse the Dao of day and night\nand thus do not know their true essence.\n\nAll things that do not grasp the Dao\nare thus bound.\n\nOnly the Perfect Sage comprehends the principles of all things,\nknows the teachings of death and life,\nand transcends the creations of things.\nThus, they guide all things without direction,\ncommand all things without response,\nparticipate in ten thousand years as one pure whole—\nwhat weight could death and life possibly hold?\"\n\nThis is called the realm of no-death—\nis it not so?\n\n**Chapter Fifty: \"The Dao Gives Birth\"**\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n*\"The Dao acts without action yet accomplishes all things.\nAll things flourish and grow,\nyet all arise from non-action.\"*\n\nThe *Cishu* explains:\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Silent and unmoving,\nyet responsive and thus harmonizing all under Heaven—\nthis is the Dao.\"*\n\nSilent and unmoving—\nthis is the essence of the Dao,\nhence its constant non-action.\nResponsive and thus harmonizing—\nthis is the function of the Dao,\nhence its non-action yet all-accomplishing.\n\nThough myriad things arise and flourish,\ntheir origins trace back to the Dao—\nthis is what is meant by:\n*\"All things flourish and grow,\nyet all arise from non-action.\"*\n\nAs Zhuangzi says:\n*\"When the two non-actions unite,\nall things transform—\nis this not so?\"*\n\n**The Dao nurtures virtue/power,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n*\"When things attain life through it, this is virtue/power.\"*\n\nThe *Cishu* explains:\n*\"Life is the radiance of virtue/power.\nBefore things take form, virtue/power is unseen.\nOnce life emerges, each attains its due—\nthus, when speaking of life, it is called virtue/power,\nfor virtue/power is what grants it.\"*\n\nAs Zhuangzi says:\n*\"When things attain life through it, this is virtue/power—\nthus, the Dao nurtures virtue/power.\"*\n\n**The Dao shapes form,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n*\"When movement is restrained and things are born,\nand life takes shape with its principles established—\nthis is form.\"*\n\nThe *Cishu* explains:\n*\"When yin is still and tranquil,\nthis is the restraint—yin itself.\nWhen yang moves and emits,\nthis is the movement—yang itself.\nYang alone cannot generate,\nso mere restraint is insufficient to birth things.\nYin alone cannot complete,\nso restraint without movement is also insufficient to birth things.\nOnly when yin and yang combine in restraint and movement\ndo things take form.\nOnce life emerges, its principles are complete—\nis this not the Dao shaping form?\"*\n\n**The Dao completes its essence.**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n*\"When form and substance are complete,\ntheir inherent tendencies manifest—\nlong and short taking shape,\nhigh and low inclining—\nthis is their natural essence.\"*\n\nThe *Cishu* explains:\n*\"Bound by things, form and substance are established.\nOnce form and substance are complete,\ntheir inherent tendencies manifest.\nAs with the crane’s long neck,\nor the duck’s short—\nnaturally taking shape;\nas with Heaven’s natural height,\nor Earth’s natural low—\nnaturally inclining.\nIs this not when form and substance are complete,\nand their inherent tendencies manifest?\"*\n\nThus, all things do not fail to revere the Dao\nand honor virtue/power.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n*\"All things first turn to the Dao.\nWhat is completed and elevated is virtue/power.\nTo revere is to overcome and diminish things,\nto honor is to ensure none can degrade them.\nMencius said:\n*'What Zhao Meng holds noble,\nZhao Meng can also degrade—\nthis is not virtue/power.'*\"\n\nThe *Cishu* explains:\n*\"The Dao is boundless in its application,\nsometimes not filling—\ndeep as the origin of all things,\nthus all things first turn to it as the Dao.\nVirtue/power is completed and elevated,\nart is completed and lowered.\nThus, what is completed and elevated is virtue/power.\nOpposing virtue/power, the Dao is revered,\nand virtue/power is honored.\nOnly reverence can overcome and diminish things—\nas Zhuangzi said:\n*'Though Heaven and Earth are vast,\nthey do not depart from within.'*\nOpposing things, virtue/power is honored,\nand things are degraded—\nas Zhuangzi said:\n*'The most noble titles and ranks are thus attained.'*\n\nMencius said:\n*'What Zhao Meng holds noble,\nZhao Meng can also degrade—\nthis is not true nobility,\nfor it lies in things, not virtue/power.'*\n\nBut virtue/power—\nthis is what each person holds noble within themselves,\nunable to degrade.\nThus, it is the noblest under Heaven.\"\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"Only those who possess it are truly noble.\"*\n\nThe reverence of the Dao,\nthe nobility of virtue/power—\nnone bestow them,\nyet they abide eternally natural.\n\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*\"Things decay with time,\nforces topple with time,\nbut the True Sovereign stands above the age—\ntrue nobility lies within oneself,\nnot borrowed from things or forces,\nyet ever remains as it is.\"*\n\nExposition:\nSome stir when acted upon,\nsome cease when restrained—these are *things*.\nSome vie in length and shortness,\nsome tilt in high and low—these are *forces*.\nTime and fate are boundless,\nyet things and forces are finite.\nIf confined by things,\nhow could decay be avoided?\nIf adorned by forces,\nhow could toppling be averted?\n\nOnly the True Sovereign stands above the age—\nno thing can humble him,\ntrue nobility lies within,\nnot gained through others,\nnot borrowed from things.\nThus, he knows no decay,\nfor he does not rely on things,\nand knows no toppling,\nfor he does not rely on forces.\nThis is why he transcends past and present,\never remaining as he is.\n\nThus, the Dao begets and nurtures,\nlengthens and matures,\ncompletes and ripens,\nnourishes and shelters.\n\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*\"Speaking separately, there are distinctions between virtue/power and things/forces;\nspeaking together, all arise from the Dao.\nThe Dao is the hidden essence of all things.\nWhen all things transform and emerge, the Dao is born with them;\nwhen all things withdraw and store, the Dao completes with them.\nIt emerges from *Zhen* [Thunder],\nis perfected in *Gen* [Mountain],\nis nurtured by *Kun* [Earth],\nis sheltered by *Qian* [Heaven].\nYang and yin interact,\nthe Eight Trigrams resonate—\nas if bound by an unseen mechanism,\nthe Dao pervades it all.\"*\n\nExposition:\nFrom the Dao’s begetting to forces’ completion—\nspeaking separately, the four stages differ,\nbut speaking together, all are encompassed by the Dao.\nThus, though Heaven and Earth are vast,\neach has its hidden essence,\nyet the Dao generates both Heaven and Earth.\nThough people are countless,\neach has its hidden essence,\nyet humanity is shaped by the Dao—\nthis is why the Dao is the hidden essence of all things.\n\nWhen spring’s breath awakens and ten thousand grasses sprout,\nthis is the transformation of all things—\nthe Dao, as Heaven’s humanity, emerges with them without hesitation.\nWhen autumn arrives and all treasures mature,\nthis is the withdrawal of all things—\nthe Dao, as humanity’s Heaven, enters with them without resistance.\n\nEven as thunder stirs them into *Zhen*,\n*Gen* restrains them into completion,\n*Kun* conceals them into nurturance,\n*Qian* governs them into shelter—\nyang and yin interact,\ngenerating the Six Children and completing transformations,\nthe Eight Trigrams resonate,\ncycling sun and moon to produce cold and heat.\nAll things thus take form,\nall flourishing things thus emerge and retreat—\nas if bound by an unseen mechanism,\nwho could command this?\nIt is the Dao that pervades it all.\n\nThe Master Lao treats life, growth, nurturing, maturation, and covering as all returning to the Dao.\nThis is simply a comprehensive way of speaking.\n\nTo generate without possessing,\nto act without claiming,\nto grow without controlling—\nthis is called the **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nTo generate is to manifest through movement and emergence,\nto act is to embody through transformation and change,\nto grow is to manifest through unification and singularity—\nwhen the Dao descends into the world,\nit resides in **virtue** alone.\n\nYet to generate without possessing its work,\nto act without claiming its ability,\nto grow without seeing its meticulous craft—\nunless one’s **virtue** is profound yet subtle,\nwho could comprehend this?\n\nThus it is called the **Mysterious Virtue**.\nThe annotation explains:\nZhuangzi says, *\"The luminous arises from the obscure\"*—\nthis implies returning to the hidden to reach the manifest,\nso there is the meaning of \"manifesting through emergence.\"\n\nThe *Yijing* says, *\"Transformation and change are called 'acting'*\"*—\nacting means to create and never cease,\nso there is the meaning of \"embodying through change.\"\n\nThe Classic says, *\"The Sage employs it to become an official and leader\"*—\nto lead is to hold noble rank and gain the people’s trust,\nso there is the meaning of \"manifesting through unification.\"\n\nThese three aspects—\nwhen the Dao descends into the world,\nthey reside in **virtue** alone.\n\nThe one who generates does so without ownership,\nthe one who transforms does so without attachment—\nno desire for gain,\nthis is called **generating without possessing its work**.\n\nThe one who harmonizes all things does so without seeking righteousness,\nthe one whose benevolence extends to all ages does so without claiming virtue—\nno pride or self-aggrandizement,\nthis is called **acting without claiming its ability**.\n\nThe one who covers and sustains Heaven and Earth,\nwho carves and shapes all forms—\nwithout displaying the skill of their craft,\nthis is called **growing without seeing its meticulous craft**.\n\nUnless one’s **virtue** is profound yet subtle,\nwho could comprehend this?\n\nThus it is called the **Mysterious Virtue**.\nBecause the profound is subtle yet small.\n\n---\n\nThe world has a **beginning**, which is called the **Mother of the World**.\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nThe **beginning** without name is Heaven and Earth,\nthe **Mother** with name is all things—\nboth the **beginning** and the **Mother** are the Dao.\nFrom the **beginning** of *qi*, it is called **beginning**,\nfrom the **generation** of all things, it is called **Mother**—\nto have a **beginning** is to be able to generate.\n\nThe annotation explains:\nBefore Heaven and Earth were born, the Dao was there.\nThe Dao is always nameless,\nso it is called the **beginning** without name.\nWhen the Dao descends into the realm,\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest—\nonly after Heaven and Earth exist do all things arise,\nso it is called the **Mother** with name.\nThe Classic says, *\"To know the ancient origins is called 'the Dao’s principle'*\"*,\nand *\"It can serve as the **Mother of the World**'*\"*—\nthus, the **beginning** and the **Mother** are both names for the Dao.\n\nThe **beginning** refers to the **origin of *qi***,\nthe **generation** of all things is called *Yijing* (change),\nand it is called the **Mother of the World**—\nthis is spoken of from the perspective of generation.\nThese two arise from the same source but have different names,\nboth called the Dao—\nso the words **beginning** and **Mother** are like fishhooks.\n\nWithout a **beginning**, it enters into non-generation;\nwith a **beginning**, it can generate.\nTo call it the **Mother of the World** is to say it lies in having a **beginning**.\n\nOnce one obtains its **Mother**, one knows its **children**.\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nThe Dao can **mother** all things and name them,\nso things are its **children**.\nThose who understand the Dao also understand all things,\nso by obtaining its **Mother**, one knows its **children**.\n\nThe annotation explains:\nThe Classic says, *\"The Dao generates them\"*—\nthus the Dao can **mother** all things and name them.\nAll things arise from the Dao,\nso the Dao is their **Mother**, and things are its **children**.\nThose who do not understand the Dao cannot harmonize all things;\nthose who understand the Dao can harmonize all things.\nIf one truly knows the Dao,\nthen the principles of all things are known without needing recognition—\nso by obtaining its **Mother**, one knows its **children**.\nOnce one knows its **children**, one again guards its **Mother**,\nand thus one’s life is never in peril.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nExcessive knowledge leads to guarding it with restraint,\nexcessive observation leads to guarding it with precision—\nto exhaust the principles of things without being burdened by them,\nto reach the Dao’s full extent without losing its subtlety,\nthen one’s use of emergence and retreat is advantageous,\nand one’s coming and going never ends—\none can preserve life, fulfill one’s years,\nand avoid danger and peril.\n\nThe annotation explains:\nThe Dao does not desire mixture;\nmixture leads to excess,\nexcess leads to disturbance—\nso by understanding unity, all affairs are complete.\nThus, the Dao’s essence is not in complexity;\nthe more one hears and sees,\nthe less one can rely on simplicity.\n\nThe Classic says, *\"Fewer things, the more one gains\"*—\nMencius says, *\"Returning to the concise is the way of simplicity.\"*\nBy this, one exhausts the principles of things—\nthen one’s broad vision sits in clarity without being burdened by them;\nby this, one reaches the Dao’s full extent—\nthen though things are chaotic and myriad, one does not lose its subtlety.\nThus one can emerge or retreat without disadvantage,\ncome or go without exhausting the Dao.\nTo drift in ease, to rest in comfort—\nthe way of preserving life and fulfilling years is achieved,\nand there should be no danger or peril.\n\nThough few in knowledge, one lacks restraint;\nfew in observation, one lacks precision—\nso one must first know its **children**,\nthen one can guard its **Mother**.\n\nBlock the **Treasure of *Yui***,\nclose its **Gate**,\nand one’s life will never be weary.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\n*Yui* means delight,\n**Gate** means exit—\nwhen things entice from without,\nthe heart delights within.\nEyes, ears, nose, and mouth—\nthe spirit and intelligence emerge from them.\nGuard your inner self,\nclose your outer senses—\ndo not take pleasure in harmonizing things,\nand things cannot lure you—\nthen one delights in Heaven and finds self-satisfaction.\nWho would toil endlessly for things?\n\nThe **spirit and intelligence** emerge from them—this is so.\n\nOnly knowing **harmony**,\none joyfully communicates without losing oneself to *Yui*.\nWith **inner restraint**,\none repels the myriad directions,\npresenting them before yet never entering their embrace;\nwith **outer closure**,\none remains still and unmoved,\nnot taking pleasure in harmonizing things,\nnot seeing what is desirable—\nthen things cannot lure one.\n\nIf so, one finds delight in **Dao** without worry,\nself-satisfaction in self-satisfaction—\nwho would toil endlessly for things?\nThis is called **eternal stillness**.\n\nOpen its *Yui*,\ncomplete its affairs—\nthen **eternal stillness** is lost forever.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nTo foolishly perceive what is pleasing,\nto engage with it and thus be drawn—\nthen one’s life is spent in ceaseless strife,\nyet never sees success.\n\nThe *Cushui* says:\n*Yui* means delight—\nwhen its *Yui* is closed, things cannot lure;\nwhen its *Yui* is opened, one foolishly perceives what is desirable.\nIf things cannot lure,\none knows to restrain the inner self,\nto close the outer senses.\nIf one foolishly perceives what is desirable,\nthen one takes pleasure in harmonizing things,\nand things gain the power to lure.\nIf such is the case,\none clashes with things in battle,\none is worn down by them in transformation—\nhow could one know delight in **Dao** and self-satisfaction,\nand not take things as one’s concern?\n\nTo toil endlessly like this,\nseeking success through deeds,\nyet never seeing it—\nthen one is lost in confusion, unaware of return,\nentrapped and unable to retreat,\nlosing one’s nature greatly—\nthis is called **eternal stillness** undone.\n\nTo see what is small is to be clear,\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nSmallness is the **mystery of the Dao**.\nTo see the **mystery of the Dao**,\nis to know oneself—\nthus there is no lack of clarity.\n\nThe *Cushui* says:\nTo return to smallness and discern through things,\nthen smallness is the **Dao’s return to non-action**.\nWhat is called seeing smallness,\nis to see the **mystery of the Dao** alone.\nTo see the **mystery of the Dao**,\nis to know oneself.\nOnly by knowing oneself,\nis there no unknown—\nas the *Classic* says:\n*\"To know oneself is to be clear.\"*\n\nTo guard softness is to be strong,\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nSoftness is the **root of the Dao**.\nTo guard the **root of the Dao**,\nis to conquer oneself—\nthus there is no unvanquished.\nThe *Cushui* says:\nThe utmost softness conquers the utmost firmness in the world—\nthus softness is the **root of the Dao**.\nWhat is called guarding softness,\nis to conquer one’s selfish desires.\nTo conquer one’s selfish desires,\nis to conquer oneself.\nOnly by conquering oneself,\nis there no unvanquished—\nas the *Classic* says:\n*\"To conquer oneself is to be strong.\"*\n\nTo employ its **light**,\nand return to its **clarity**.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\n**Clarity** is the essence of **light**.\n**Light** is the function of **clarity**.\nWhen the Sage responds to the world,\nfrom essence arises function—\nthen radiance spreads as **light**,\nand when function is withdrawn to essence—\nthen wisdom penetrates as **clarity**.\nTo display **ren** outwardly,\nto conceal it in action—\nlike the sun and moon:\nall things are illuminated and clear,\nyet never diminished—\nthis is how one manifests the **virtue of spirit and clarity**.\n\nThe *Cushui* says:\n**Clarity** and **light**,\ndifferent names, same reality—\nfrom essence arises function,\nthen **clarity** disperses as **light**,\nso **light** is the function of **clarity**.\nWhen function is withdrawn to essence,\nthen **light** returns to **clarity**,\nso **clarity** is the essence of **light**.\nWhen the Sage responds to the world,\n**clarity** emerges as **light**,\nthen **light** shines upon the four quarters—\nthis is called:\n*\"From essence arises function,\nthen radiance spreads as **light**.\"*\nWhen **light** returns to **clarity**,\nthen its **clarity** ascends—\nthis is called:\n*\"Function is withdrawn to essence,\nthen wisdom penetrates as **clarity**.\"*\nThus, to employ its **light**,\nthough **ren** may sometimes be displayed,\nto return to its **clarity**,\nwhile **light** is naturally concealed—\nlike the sun and moon adorned in the sky,\nilluminating all things—\nthe **clarity** of the sun and moon\nis never truly diminished.\nThe *Yijing* speaks of *\"manifesting the **virtue of spirit and clarity**\"*—\nthis is why.\n\nWithout abandoning the body to misfortune,\nthis is called **embracing constancy**.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nThe transformation of things is without constancy.\nOnly those who return to **command** abandon things and distance themselves from people,\nreturning to **clarity** without joining the transformation of things—\nthus they embody constancy without harm,\ndiffering from those who scheme with form to create **light**.\n\nThe *Cushui* says:\nThe **spirit** transforms into decay,\ndecay transforms back into **spirit**—\nthis is the **transformation of things** without constancy.\nBut if one returns to **command**, it is not so:\nabandoning wisdom and returning to simplicity,\none distances oneself from things and people,\nreturning to **stillness and clarity** while regaining **clarity**—\nenduring through ages yet unchanging,\ntranscending all forms without alteration—\nhow could one join the transformation of things?\nTo know **command** within oneself,\nas when spring and summer return to autumn and winter,\nembracing nature while preserving life—\nthis is why one embodies constancy without harm.\nThen how different is this\nfrom those who scheme with form to create **light**,\nand thus must avoid them like a recluse!\n\n*\"Let me stand firm with knowledge of the fifth-thirty-third,*\nwalking the **Great Dao**,\nonly **generosity** do I fear.*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nThe **Dao** rejects excess and extravagance—\nexcess leads to licentiousness in **virtue**,\nextravagance leads to wastefulness in nature—\n**generosity** is the fault.\n**Firmness** is smallness discerning through things.\nTo stand firm and discern through things,\nwhile inwardly knowing oneself—\nthen one’s roots are deep and foundation solid,\ntaking sufficiency in one’s own body—\nthus one fears only **generosity**.\n\nThe *Cushui* says:\nExcess and extravagance,\nthe **Dao** rejects them—\nthus the *Classic* says:\n*\"The Sage rejects excess and extravagance.\"*\nExcess leads to licentiousness in **virtue**,\nnot the *\"inner preservation while outer senses remain undisturbed.\"*\nExtravagance leads to wastefulness in nature,\nnot the *\"inner simplicity walking the **Dao of the Nameless**.\"*\nExcess and extravagance,\nare not the **Dao of frugality and generosity**.\nTo be small and sidelong is not **firmness**—\n**firmness** is not its nature,\nbut to discern and assist.\nThis is the meaning of **firmness**—\nthus **firmness** is smallness discerning through things.\nTo stand firm and discern through things,\none does not take pleasure in harmonizing things—\nthus one is not lured by things,\nwhile inwardly knowing oneself.\nIf so,\nthen one’s nature returns to itself,\none’s form is preserved whole—\ndeep roots and solid foundation are achieved.\nIndeed, **nature** is the root of form,\nand form is its foundation.\n\nWith deep roots and firm foundations,\none returns to guarding its **Mother**—\n*indulging in virtue* and *excessive nature*?\nHow could this be the **Dao**?\n\nOnly the **inner observation** is cultivated,\nnot the **outer pursuits**—\nthose who suffice within themselves\nhave truly attained it.\n\n*\"Only giving is feared,\"*\nfor it differs from those who *aspire to temporal gain*.\nThe **Great Dao** is most level,\nyet people prefer shortcuts.\n\n*Huizong’s Commentary* says:\n*\"The Dao is level, while shortcuts are swift—\nto seek swiftness for near-term success\nis only to distance oneself from the Dao.\"*\n\n*Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"If the Dao is like a great

others.*\n\nMaster Zhuang (庄子) said:\n*\"The **Dao** acts upon all things;\nthe highest governance of others is through *affairs* (事).\"*\nThus, how one governs others through the **Dao**’s *remnants* is clear.\n\nTo cultivate it in the state,\nits **virtue/power** becomes *abundant*—*\nto cultivate it throughout all under heaven,\nits **virtue/power** becomes *universal*—*\nfor once **virtue/power** is shared with others,\napplying it to the realm brings fullness and sufficiency,\nextending it to all under heaven covers all broadly—\nas said: *the **Dao**’s *straightforwardness* in governing states and all under heaven.*\n\nMaster Yang (杨子) said:\n*\"Though all under heaven is vast,\ngoverning it lies in the **Dao**.\"*\nThus, how one governs states and all under heaven through the **Dao**’s *straightforwardness* is clear.\n\nThe farther one’s cultivation extends,\nthe more **virtue/power**’s resonance endures—\nreaching the utmost distance,\nas said: *\"The near can be extended through this.\"*\n\nThe broader one’s **virtue/power** spreads,\nthe more *profound virtue* (盛德) is called *new*—*\nreaching boundless scope,\nas said: *\"The extent of **virtue/power**’s reach.\"*\n\nAll within oneself is its *true* essence,\nthus *true* lies in the inner,\nto receive from Heaven.\nOutward manifestations are but its *remnants*,\nthus *remnants* lie in the outer,\nto propagate afar—\nhence, *excessive* follows *true*,\n*abundant* follows *long-lasting*,\nand these belong to the **Dao**’s external unfoldings.\n\nIndeed, the **Dao** is what all things follow;\n**virtue/power** is the **Dao** within oneself—\n*excessive*, *long-lasting*, *abundant*, *universal*—\nall are the **Dao** manifesting as **virtue/power**,\nthus they belong to the **Dao**’s external unfoldings.\n\nYet the Sage, through the **Dao**,\ngoverns oneself without straying from *truth*—\neven when cultivating all under heaven,\nonly the **Dao**’s *remnants* and *straightforwardness* emerge in response.\nThe reason it is *true* is that it neither harms nor benefits—\nthe Sage values *truth* precisely for this.\n\nThus, one observes oneself through oneself,\none’s family through one’s family,\none’s village through one’s village,\none’s state through one’s state,\nand all under heaven through all under heaven.\n\n*Huizong’s Commentary* (徽宗注) says:\n*\"All things are fully present within me,\nturn inward and be sincere,\nand there is no greater joy—\nthus observing oneself through oneself brings self-governance,\nand this applies by analogy.\"*\n\nAll under heaven has its *constant nature* (常然),\nand all things arise from it,\nall find fulfillment in it—\nby extending the *constant nature* of my heart\nto all under heaven,\nthose of like kind respond without losing their *constant nature*.\n\nThus, one governs all under heaven without actively governing—\nfor *observation* (观) requires\nthat the higher observe the lower,\nthen the lower may observe the higher.\nObserving from above to below,\nas in the *I Ching*’s *\"central rectitude in observing all under heaven\"*—\nobserving from below to above,\nas in the *Rites of Zhou*’s *\"commanding all the people to observe the governance’s symbols\"*—\nthe observation of higher and lower is thus.\n\nIf the higher and lower observe in this way,\nthen following them becomes effortless.\n\nAs the *Records* (《记》) say:\n*\"First cultivate oneself, then harmonize the family,\nharmonize the family, then govern the state,\ngovern the state, then bring peace to all under heaven—*\nthis aligns perfectly with the above.\n\nHow do I know all under heaven is thus?\nThrough this.\n\n*Huizong’s Commentary* says:\n*\"The simple and easy reveal all under heaven’s principles.\"*\n\n*Cushui* (疏义) explains:\n*\"The *trigram Qian* (乾) is firm and constant,\nits **Dao** seemingly difficult,\nyet it shows people the ever-easy.\nThe *trigram Kun* (坤) is receptive and yielding,\nits **Dao** seemingly complex,\nyet it shows people the ever-simple.\nQian and Kun reveal the simple and easy to people,\nthus the governance’s symbols are observable—\neasy to know, simple to follow.\nEasy to know without fearing what is hard to know,\nsimple to follow without fearing what is hard to follow—\nthen though the talents and principles of all under heaven\nare hidden in the utmost traces,\nthey can be penetrated and understood without remainder,\nwhat need is there to seek elsewhere?\nFrom this perspective,\none sees that the Sage’s practice is the most restrained,\nyet its application is the most expansive—\nachieved through the simple and easy,\nthus it is said: *‘Observe Heaven and Earth, and you will see the Sage.’*\nThe chapter *\"Thick with Virtue\"* (含德之厚), the fifty-fifth.*」\n\n**Thick with Virtue** compares to the infant.\n\nThe **Huizong Commentary** says: Only when a person’s virtue is profound does their nature not shift with things. Thick with virtue, they do not stray with things, thus their *qi* is concentrated and their will is singular.\n\nMencius said: The noble person does not lose the heart of an infant.\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: Who among those born with innate nature does not cherish this virtuous excellence? Yet when they interact with others, few can uphold it.\n\nOnly when virtue is profound does one speak of its root in nature. If one strays with things, then nature is submerged in artifice.\n\nOnly those thick with virtue do not see strange things and stray from them. Not straying with things, their *qi* is concentrated and their will is singular.\n\nThus **Liezi** said: In infancy, *qi* is concentrated and will is singular—this is the utmost harmony. Things cannot harm them, and no virtue surpasses them.\n\n*Qi* is empty and awaits things; when concentrated, it is still and unmixed—this aligns with the *Classic*’s “concentrating *qi* to govern softness.”\n\nWill is where the mind directs itself; when singular, it is unified and not divided—this aligns with Confucius’ “as one whose will is singular.”\n\nWhen *qi* is concentrated and will is singular, constant virtue does not depart, and one returns to infancy—thus Mencius praised the noble person who does not lose the heart of an infant.\n\nIndeed, fulfilling one’s nature is the noble person’s affair. To fulfill one’s nature is to be substantial yet not lose the source of emptiness, to act yet not lose the basis of stillness—this is the infant’s purity without deficiency, truth without artifice. What need for choice?\n\nThus the great person dwells in profundity, not shallowness. Poisonous creatures do not sting, fierce beasts do not seize, snatching birds do not strike.\n\nThe **Huizong Commentary** says: Those thick with virtue have no place for worry to enter, no room for perverse *qi* to attack—thus nothing can harm them.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said: If a person can empty themselves to engage with the world, who can harm them?\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: The world values the infant because they are still and unchanging, pure and unadulterated, free from the fear of misfortune, unburdened by perverse *qi*.\n\nThick with virtue compares to the infant—thus worry cannot enter, perverse *qi* cannot attack. Worry comes from without, hence “enter.” Perverse *qi* seizes gaps, hence “attack.” If worry cannot enter, their virtue is whole; if perverse *qi* cannot attack, their spirit is unharmed.\n\nIf so, calamity does not come, fortune does not arrive—unmoved by things’ gains and harms, thus nothing can harm them. If nothing can harm them, they have nothing to oppose, reaching the utmost emptiness.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said: If a person can empty themselves to wander in the world, who can harm them? Indeed, the utmost emptiness leaves no opening for things—like an empty boat struck by currents, even those with narrow minds do not anger.\n\nIf a person attains emptiness to wander among worldly affairs, yielding and conforming like flowing water, who can harm them? This is how the perfected one’s mind works like a mirror—neither grasping nor resisting, responding without storing, thus able to overcome things without harm. This too is emptiness.\n\nBones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm. They do not know the union of male and female yet are aroused—this is the utmost *jing*.\n\nThe **Huizong Commentary** says: When virtue is whole, form is whole, hence bones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm. When form is whole, spirit is whole, hence they do not know the union of male and female yet are aroused. The utmost *jing* can enter the spirit—**Zhuangzi** said: The Sage values *jing*.\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: Life is the radiance of virtue; to preserve virtue is to preserve form—this is “virtue whole, form whole.” The body is the dwelling of the spirit; to preserve form is to preserve spirit—this is “form whole, spirit whole.”\n\nWhen virtue is whole, form is whole, hence bones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm—because their form is generated without exhaustion, they do not know where to take hold, yet their grip is firm. This differs from laboring the form without rest, leading to exhaustion.\n\nWhen form is whole, spirit is whole, hence they do not know the union of male and female yet are aroused—because their spirit is whole and unharmed, they do not know what to unite with, yet they are aroused. This differs from overusing *jing* without cessation, leading to depletion.\n\nWithout the utmost *jing*, who could achieve this? Only the utmost *jing* in the world can merge with the utmost spirit of the world. The utmost *jing* can enter the spirit, thus *jing* and spirit merge without separation.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said: The Sage values *jing*—because the singular *jing* harmonizes with the natural order. If a person harmonizes with the natural order, they are also the natural order itself. This is why the Sage values *jing*.\n\nWhen **Zhuangzi** discusses nurturing the spirit, his words touch on valuing *jing*—is this not because spirit and *jing* arise from the Dao, and form originates from *jing*? Is there not truth in this?\n\nTo cry all day yet the voice does not grow hoarse—this is the utmost harmony.\n\nThe **Huizong Commentary** says: Attaining singularity is called *jing*; *jing* means virtue is whole and spirit is unharmed. Pure *qi* achieves harmony, thus harmony means *qi* is whole and the voice does not grow hoarse.\n\nA person’s life receives *jing* from Heaven’s One to become the source of wisdom, and harmony from Heaven’s Five to become the foundation of trust. When perfected, they can enter the spirit, can restore their vital command.\n\nBut those who lose the heart of an infant—*jing* wavers and is not preserved, *qi* erupts and is not pure, they abandon their innate nature, submerging it in myriad things. Is this not tragic?\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: All things transform through *jing* and take form; they receive One to live. Concentrating One is called *jing*. Attaining singularity means not being divided—this aligns with the *Yijing*’s “speaking of attaining singularity.”\n\n*Jing* is the utmost rectitude of Heaven’s virtue; preserving *jing* means virtue is whole and spirit is unharmed—this is “their Heavenly Guard is whole, their spirit has no flaws.”\n\nAll things bear yin and embrace yang; obtaining the balance of yin and yang, pure *qi* achieves harmony.\n\nThe harmonizing *qi* interflows and achieves balance—this aligns with Zhuangzi’s account of the harmonious *qi* as the essence of humanity.\n\nBalance, when expressed, is always measured and harmonious. When balance is attained, *qi* is whole and the throat does not constrict—this is what is meant by: *\"The elder brother cries all day but his throat never constricts; this is the ultimate of harmony.\"*\n\nHuman life begins when *jing* is received from Heaven’s One, becoming the root of wisdom, and when balance is attained from Heaven’s Five, becoming the foundation of sincerity.\n\nIndeed, *jing* is what the One generates; it is received from Heaven’s One as water, corresponding to the North in direction, and thus becomes the root of wisdom. Balance is what *qi* attains; it is received from Heaven’s Five as earth, residing centrally in position, and thus becomes the foundation of sincerity.\n\nWhen humans are born, they embody the five phases, from Heaven’s One to Heaven’s Five, and the numbers of their formation are complete. If one truly preserves the One and dwells in balance, and further cultivates the self, they may live a thousand two hundred years without ever decaying in form.\n\nWhen they attain this state, can they not enter the spirit and restore their vital command?\n\nTo enter the spirit is to attain the ineffable—this is what is meant by *\"the profound essence entering the spirit.\"*\n\nTo restore the vital command is to return to stillness—this is what is meant by *\"stillness is called restoring the vital command.\"*\n\nYet the world’s people lose their infantile heart because their *jing* wavers and is not preserved, their *qi* erupts and is not pure. How much more could they know of not letting their *jing* waver, preserving it and not losing it, and not letting their *qi* erupt, making it pure and unharmed?\n\nInstead, they abandon their innate nature to harm their life, submerging themselves in myriad things to drown their desires. Their self-abandonment is so extreme—is this not tragic?\n\n**Knowing harmony is constancy.**\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"The preservation of pure qi, with vital command governed within, form transforms while nature does not perish.\"*\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: *\"Balance is the great harmony with all things.\"*\n\nGuan Yin’s discourse on the Perfect One, who walks above all things without fear, states: *\"This is the preservation of pure qi.\"*\n\nIf one can preserve their *qi*, making it pure and unadulterated, then its gentle harmony is evident.\n\nOnly when harmony is perfected can one traverse the beginning and end of all things, and communicate with the creation of all things—this is what is meant by *\"vital command governed within, form transforms while nature does not perish.\"*\n\nWhen vital command is governed within, creation originates from oneself, enduring through all ages and eternally existing.\n\nWhen form transforms while nature does not perish, one nature remains constant, enduring myriad forms without change, encompassing Heaven and Earth, inheriting the primal *qi*—how could this not be called constancy?\n\n**Knowing constancy is clarity.**\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Clarity suffices to perceive the Dao because it knows nature does not perish.\"*\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: *\"The *Transmission* says: Inner vision is called clarity.\"*\n\nClarity suffices to perceive the Dao—this is beyond the reach of mere sight. Above form, one gazes with spirit alone, still and returning to the origin, awakening to see the singular. Then one knows that nature abides within, eternally fixed since antiquity.\n\nAs in the *Yijing*: *\"Nurturing nature, nature abides—this is the gateway to Dao and virtue.\"*\n\nBecause nature abides, its abiding is the gateway to Dao and virtue, then Heaven and Earth are born from it—even Heaven and Earth depend on this to be born. How could clarity not suffice to perceive the Dao, knowing that nature does not perish?\n\n**Augmenting life brings omens.**\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Omens are the presages of things; the principle of generating life, when augmented, becomes superfluous—fortune and misfortune are yet undetermined.\"*\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: *\"Divine omens manifest as signs; knowing how to respond, omens are the presages of things. Fortune and misfortune are already foretold—how could one escape their response?\"*\n\nMoreover, the generation of things is complete in its own principle. To augment it only adds excess, like hastening the growth of seedlings—this is to encourage what is already complete. These are all instances of humans aiding Heaven, yet fortune and misfortune remain undetermined.\n\nOnly by following nature without augmentation, without letting likes and dislikes internally harm the body, can one attain Heaven’s fullest bestowal.\n\n**The heart directs *qi* as strength.**\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"When the body aligns with the heart, and the heart aligns with *qi*, then *qi* is harmonious and does not erupt. The stumbling and rushing are *qi*—yet the heart truly compels this strength.\"*\n\nTo contend with things in this way is not the path of self-mastery.\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: *\"The body is the heart’s dwelling.\"*\n\nWhen the body aligns with the heart, all actions of the four limbs are rooted in the heart. The heart is the sovereign of *qi*.\n\nWhen the heart aligns with *qi*, then cultivating the mind in stillness allows *qi* to merge with emptiness. Kang Changzi said: *\"If the body aligns with the heart and the heart aligns with *qi*, then in the way of nurturing *qi*, one knows its foundation.\"*\n\nOnly when *qi* is properly nurtured can it be harmonious and not erupt, achieving ultimate softness.\n\nNow, the stumbling and rushing—when walking, they do not conform to Xia Wu’s measured steps, and when moving, they do not conform to the graceful *Shao Hao*—all are the result of erupting *qi*.\n\nIf stumbling and rushing persist, even if the leader of *qi* is at fault, it is truly the heart that compels it—this is what is called *\"strength.\"* To contend with things in this way means joy aligns with yang and anger aligns with yin, yet this is not the path of self-mastery. How could people know that harmony and softness suffice to pacify things, making them unable to harm?\n\n**When things flourish, they age—this is called not the Dao.**\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"The Dao knows no past or future, yet things have flourishing and aging, strength has its time of weakness, and prosperity has its time of decline. They are enslaved by time and governed by fate—how could this be the Dao?\"*\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: *\"There are those who live, and those who give life; there are those with form, and those who shape form. The Dao knows no past or future, so giving life never ends, and shaping form never ceases. This is what Zhuangzi meant by *self-rooted, self-originating, eternally fixed since antiquity.*\"*\n\n「When things have phases of flourishing and aging, then there is the *Dao of life and death*—this is what Liezi meant by *the great transformation* where youth is followed by vigor, then old age and decrepitude.\n\nOnly in their transformation from youth to vigor, from vigor to old age, do the principles of strength and weakness, rise and decline manifest. Bound by the *造物* [Creator’s] silent decree, they cannot escape—thus strength has its time of weakness, and one must consider softness; prosperity has its time of decline, and one must reflect on repose.\n\nThey are enslaved by time as *overflowing and deficient*, constrained by fate as *abundant and scarce*—how could this be the Dao?\n\nThe Dao is *not the Dao* from the very beginning. Huizong’s annotation: *\"The Dao has never been exhausted, yet the people’s confusion persists, saying it is so since ancient times.\"*\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: *\"The *Wuji* [Non-Extreme] contains no *Wuji*, the *Wujin* [Non-Exhaustion] contains no *Wujin*—thus the Dao is never exhausted.\n\nThose who lose their nature in worldly affairs see only things, not the Dao. As form transforms, their minds are equally bewildered, and they never understand it their whole lives. The people’s confusion has indeed been long-standing—how could they know the Dao has endured eternally, without ever perishing, throughout all time?\n\n*Laozi’s True Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue—Exegesis, Volume Ten concluded. Volume Eleven begins.*」\n\nThe scholar Jiang Cheng of the Imperial Academy expounds:\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Wise Do Not Speak**\n*\"The wise do not speak; those who speak do not know.\"*\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"The Dao has no questions; questions have no answers. Thus, those who know the Dao remain silent and intuitively grasp it, having no need to speak.\"*\n\nYiqié questioned Wangni, yet through four inquiries and four unknowns, his words exhausted themselves, and he grew distant from the Dao.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nWhat can be articulated is but the coarse nature of things.\nWhat can be intuited is the refined essence of things.\nThe Dao’s supreme refinement is profound and inscrutable—though one might wish to speak of it, words fail to capture it, hence there are no questions.\n\nFor there is an entrance to the Dao, one may question it.\nBut the Dao itself has no entrance—who can question it?\nFor there are questions, one may respond to them.\nBut the Dao itself has no questions—who can respond to it?\nThus, those who seek answers to questions about the Dao do not know the Dao.\nThe sage explains this by saying:\n*\"The Dao can be received by spirit but not transmitted through speech;\nit can be intuitively grasped by the heart but not sought through outward traces.\"*\nSo, the ultimate speech transcends speech,\nand attains the mystery of silence—\none must remain silent and intuitively grasp it.\n\nIf one sees the Dao with the eyes, it remains stored within—\nhow can it be contained by sound?\nWhat need then for speech?\n\nThe *Yijing* speaks of *\"silent and it is accomplished\"*,\nLiezi speaks of *\"silent and it is attained\"*—\nthis is the very meaning.\n\nIn the past, when Yiqié questioned Wangni,\nhe first asked of what all things are the same—\nWangni did not know.\nThen he asked of knowing what one does not know—\nWangni did not know.\nNext he asked of things having no knowledge—\nWangni did not know.\nFinally, he asked of knowing not being ignorance and ignorance not being knowing—\nWangni did not know.\nFour questions, four unknowns.\n\nNot that he did not know—\nrather, knowing was shallow, ignorance profound;\nknowing was external, ignorance internal—\nhis unknown was the true knowing.\n\nBut those who cling to words,\nentangled in endless speech, cannot escape confusion—\nwho knows that the Dao cannot be spoken of,\nand yet speech is inevitable?\n\nBlock its *fuè* [receptive/outward aspect],\nclose its entrance—\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Dull the senses and preserve the spirit; withdraw and hide in secrecy.\"*\n\n**Exegesis:**\nFor those whose outward aspect is confused,\none cannot grasp them through excessive speech\nto lead them to the inward essence;\nfor those whose inward aspect is confused,\none cannot entangle them in convoluted speech\nto lead them to the outward essence.\nBlock its *fuè*, then there is no confusion of inward and outward,\nand the harmonious joy flows freely without losing its receptivity.\n\nIn sleep, the *hun* [ethereal soul] mingles;\nin waking, the form opens.\nEngaging with others brings discord—\nit is called *\"fighting with the heart\"*—\nclose its entrance, then there is no peril of heart-fighting.\nThe well-closed cannot be opened without a key.\n\nThis is what Zhuangzi called *\"dull the senses and preserve the spirit,\"*\nand what the *Yijing* called *\"withdraw and hide in secrecy.\"*\n\nFor dulling the senses brings clarity to the Dao’s inscrutable depth,\nunlured by things, one can thus embrace the spirit in stillness\nand merge with it—\nthis is called *\"blocking its fuè.\"*\n\nHiding in secrecy returns to the origin of nature,\nwhere nothing enters of its own accord—\none can thus conceal within heaven and merge with heaven—\nthis is called *\"closing its entrance.\"*\n\nGuangchengzi said:\n*\"Guard your inward self,\nseal your outward self,\ndull its sharpness,\nunravel its confusion.\"*\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Take depth as root,\ntake restraint as measure.\"*\n\n**Exegesis:**\nSharpness is like fire’s form—\nit cannot avoid injury,\nbut if dulled, it will not harm.\nConfusion is like tangled threads—\nit cannot avoid disorder,\nbut if unraveled, it will not be disordered.\nThis is what Zhuangzi called *\"take depth as root,\ntake restraint as measure.\"*\n\nFor depth aligns with the *Yijing*’s *\"ultimate depth and probing the subtle\"*—\ntaking depth as root means one does not follow superficial trends,\ninteracting with things without harming them,\nand things cannot harm one—\nthis is called *\"dull its sharpness.\"*\n\nRestraint aligns with Mencius’ *\"guard restraint while applying breadth\"*—\ntaking restraint as measure means one does not drown the heart in excess,\nthough myriad affairs unfold before one,\nyet cannot enter to merge—\nthis is called *\"unravel its confusion.\"*\n\nHarmonize its radiance,\nalign with its dust—\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Follow things with flexibility,\nand conform to their currents.\"*\n\n**Exegesis:**\nHarmonize refers to its non-defiance;\nalign refers to its non-separation.\nHarmonizing its radiance means radiance without dazzle—\nnot like the formed and polished that produces light.\nAligning with its dust means great unity with things—\nnot like those who withdraw from the world and differ from customs.\nThis is Zhuangzi’s *\"follow things with flexibility and conform to their currents.\"*\n\nOnly by shifting with the times,\nand rising or falling with the world,\nflexing and yielding without clashing with things,\nnever setting oneself apart in rigid distinction,\ncan one attain this.\n\nThis is called *Xuántóng* [Mysterious Unity].\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"The Dao returns to the utmost profound,\nand unites with the utmost singular—\nthe utmost profound is called Mysterious,\nthe singular is called Unity.\nMysterious Unity means all things and I,\nyet choosing among them is impossible—\nhow could one secretly entangle oneself in distinctions of near and far,\nbenefit and harm,\nnobility and lowliness?\"*\n\n**Exegesis:**\nEntering the inscrutable gate,\nconcealing the Dao without revealing it—\nthis is returning to the utmost profound.\nMerging in the primal chaos,\ngathering all into one Dao—\nthis is uniting with the utmost singular.\nReturning to the utmost profound,\nit dwells in subtle transformations—\nsmall yet wondrous—\nhence the term *Mysterious*.\nUniting with the utmost singular,\nit encompasses all distinctions—\ndifferent yet unified—\nhence the term *Unity*.\n\nOnly when the small merges with things,\nobtaining their singularity and aligning with it,\ndoes one know that things are inherently without things,\nand I am not truly I—\nwhen things and self are both forgotten,\nall things and I become one,\nand choosing among them is impossible—\nhow could one secretly entangle oneself in near and far,\nbenefit and harm,\nnobility and lowliness?\n\nFor all distinctions are originally non-existent—\none cannot attain to be near,\none cannot attain to be distant,\none cannot attain to benefit,\none cannot attain to harm,\none cannot attain to nobility,\none cannot attain to lowliness—\nthus one is noble for all under heaven.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"The world’s people attack each other with love and hate,\nand thus have attitudes of nearness and distance.\nEmotions and pretense influence each other,\nand thus distinctions of benefit and harm arise.\nActions vie for advantage,\nand thus divisions of nobility and lowliness

love and hatred,\nforget emotions and pretense,\nabandon gain and loss,\nand merge in mystery with the One Nature within—\nthus their nobility is complete,\nand all under heaven is forgotten,\nhence they are noble for all under heaven.\n\n**Cui’s Annotation:** The passions of the world\ncreate their own likeness and difference,\ntheir own right and wrong,\ntheir own gain and loss.\nWhen aligned with oneself, one loves it;\nwhen divergent from oneself, one hates it—\nlove and hatred clash, giving rise to nearness and distance.\nTo depart from passion is wrong,\nto depart from pretense is right—\npassion and pretense intertwine, giving rise to perceptions of benefit and harm.\nWhat one possesses is lowly;\nwhat one loses, one mourns—\nwhat one gains at the moment is noble, and one rejoices in it—\ngain and loss vie for advantage, creating distinctions of nobility and lowliness.\nThese distinctions arise and vanish,\nshift and alternate,\nebbing and flowing without end—\nhow far they are from the Dao!\nHow can they suffice to be noble for all under heaven?\n\nBut the Dao is that which all under heaven do not fail to be noble in.\nThose who know the Dao understand this,\npenetrate the true nature of things,\nand preserve their root.\nThey transcend words and cast off the burden of speech,\nlove what is not loved,\nhate what is not hated—\nand thus extinguish love and hatred.\nThus they have no extreme nearness,\nno extreme distance—\nnearness and distance cannot be attained.\nPassion is not true,\npretense is not false—\nand thus they forget emotions and pretense.\nThus they do not cling to benefit,\nnor resist harm—\nbenefit and harm cannot be attained.\nThere is no use in what is used,\nwhat is used is not truly useful—\nand thus they depart from gain and loss.\nThus nobility and lowliness are not in them—\nnobility and lowliness do not belong to themselves.\nOnly knowing the One Nature’s truth,\nthey do not see the world’s pretense—\ntheir nobility is complete,\nall under heaven is forgotten,\nhence they are noble for all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing with Rectitude**\nTo govern with rectitude,\nto employ the extraordinary in warfare,\nand to take all under heaven with non-action.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** Rectitude is the Dao’s constancy,\nthe extraordinary is the Dao’s variation,\nnon-action is the Dao’s truth.\nThe nation is settled by rectitude,\nvictory in war comes from the extraordinary,\nthe Dao’s truth is without private interference.\nFollowing things in their natural course,\nall under heaven is governed.\n\n**Cui’s Annotation:** Uprightness is rectitude;\nrectitude is to abide in the One.\nOnly by abiding in the One\ndoes one preserve the eternal constancy—\nthus rectitude is the Dao’s constancy.\nRectitude again becomes extraordinary;\nthe extraordinary is to oppose rectitude.\nOnly by opposing rectitude\ndoes one abandon the old constancy—\nthus the extraordinary is the Dao’s variation.\nTruth varies with things,\nyet never lacks—\ntruth abides within,\nand thus one does not externally engage in affairs—\nthus non-action is the Dao’s truth.\nWhat is first in governing the nation?\nOnly to abide in the One.\nThe nation is settled by rectitude—\nthis is what Mencius said: *\"One rectitude and the nation is settled.\"*\nTo hold victory has its method,\nstrategic planning is all—\nthis is what Zhuangzi said: *\"Continuous and cautious, unmeasurable and unconquerable.\"*\nTruth is the utmost of sincerity;\nonly when one is empty of worldly concerns\ncan truth be preserved—\nthus the Dao’s truth is without private interference.\nWithout private interference,\none does not contrive pretense for others,\nand simply follows things in their natural course.\nIf so, then without deliberate governance,\nall under heaven is governed.\nThe Classic says: *\"Thus those who take all under heaven,\nalways do so with non-action.\"*\n\nHow do I know this is so?\nThe world abounds in prohibitions,\nyet the people grow ever poorer.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** The people are not difficult to gather—\nlove them and they become close,\nbenefit them and they come.\nBut if one governs with what they hate,\nthey scatter.\nNow without hearts of love and benefit,\nyet with many prohibitions and strict scrutiny,\nthe people will scatter to the four quarters—\nthus the people grow ever poorer.\n\n**Cui’s Annotation:** To gain all under heaven has its method,\nto gain its people is to gain all under heaven.\nTo gain its people has its method,\nto gain their hearts is to gain the people.\nFor indeed, to love and benefit them\nis how one gains their hearts.\nTo impose what they hate\nis to lose their hearts.\nThis one loves them because I love them—\nthus they love me as a parent.\nThis one benefits them because I benefit them—\nthus they carry their children and come to me.\nIf one oppresses them to satisfy one’s desires,\nexploits them to sustain oneself,\nand imposes what they hate,\nthen they will all take each other’s hands and depart.\nThus without hearts of love and benefit,\nyet indulging in cruelty to assert one’s power,\nwith many prohibitions and harsh scrutiny to claim one’s wisdom,\none cannot enrich the people with governance—\nthe people will scatter to the four quarters,\nand the common folk will barely suffice.\nThis is called *\"overflowing above and leaking below\"*—\nwho knows the way of governance being dim and murky,\nwhile its people are pure and simple?\n\nWhen people abound in clever tools,\nthe state grows increasingly corrupt.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** Those who have clever devices must have clever schemes,\nthose who have clever schemes must have clever hearts.\nClever hearts arise, and then purity and simplicity are incomplete—\nsometimes deceiving the ruler to oppose the Dao.\n\n**Cui’s Annotation:** If one makes measures and weights to regulate them,\nthey will also use measures and weights to steal.\nIf one makes scales and balances to weigh them,\nthey will also use scales and balances to steal—\nthus breaking measures and weights,\nthe people will not contend.\nYet those who possess clever devices\nmust have clever schemes,\nand those who have clever schemes\nmust have clever hearts—\nthis is why the *I Ching* speaks of the \"Old Man of Han Yin.\"\nIndeed, the *I Ching* says:\n*\"The creative (乾) is known by its ease,\nthe receptive (坤) by its simplicity,\nand thus the principles of all under heaven are attained.\"*\nOnce clever devices are made,\nclever schemes will inevitably take form,\nand once clever schemes take form,\nclever hearts will inevitably arise.\nWhen clever hearts arise,\nwhat was once empty becomes filled,\nwhat was once unified becomes scattered—\nthe so-called *\"without mixing with anything, pure and unstained\"*\nmay well be diminished—\nthis is why purity and simplicity are incomplete.\nOne will see cleverness and deceit clash,\nartifice and pretense flourish daily—\nsometimes deceiving the ruler to oppose the Dao—\nthis is why the Sage acts,\nyet pardons all under heaven,\nto remove this calamity.\n\nWhen people rely too much on cleverness,\nstrange things will proliferate.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"If cleverness prevails, people will turn to frivolous pursuits,\nand thus strange garments and odd instruments will emerge to disrupt customs.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:\n*\"If one man does not plow,\nthe whole world will suffer from his hunger;\ntherefore, the ancient sages taught the people\nto avoid useless labor that harms productive work,\nand to value practical goods over rare ones,\nlest frivolous pursuits harm agriculture.\"*\n\nIn the age of supreme virtue,\nthe people are simple and unadorned,\nknowing only the daily necessities of food and drink—\nwho among them would have the skill for elaborate cleverness?\n\nIndeed, if cleverness prevails,\npeople will turn to frivolous pursuits,\nand thus strange garments and odd instruments will emerge to disrupt customs.\n\nThe ancient rulers governed by this principle:\nwhenever strange garments or odd instruments were sold in the marketplace\nor brought into the palace,\nthere were fixed punishments to uphold the essential\nand suppress the frivolous,\nso that the people might return\nto the honest and steadfast customs of old.\n\nAs laws and decrees grow stricter,\nthieves and robbers multiply.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"If strictness becomes excessive,\nthere will inevitably arise hearts that defy it.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:\n*\"To observe the deep fish is an ill omen,\nto outwit the hidden is to invite calamity;\nthus, once laws are established, deceit arises,\nand once decrees are issued, trickery flourishes.*\nIf one merely taxes a few bushels of grain\nand multiplies laws to oppress the people,\none will not stop theft—\nfor theft will persist.\nThis is what *Zhuangzi* meant when he said:\n*'If strictness becomes excessive,\nthere will inevitably arise hearts that defy it.'*\nThis is the truth of it.\n\nThe people, being simple and unknowing,\nif treated gently will submit,\nif oppressed will seek vengeance—\nunless the ruler governs with benevolence,\nwho would willingly reform and avoid crime?\n\nThus, the Sage governs through policy,\naligns through punishment,\nand the people escape punishment yet feel no shame.\n\nHence, the Sage declares:\n*\"I act without action, and the people transform themselves.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"Heaven governs without action and remains clear,\nEarth governs without action and remains tranquil;\nwhen these two—without action—harmonize,\nall things naturally transform.\nThe Sage follows Heaven and Earth alone,\nso the people reform without knowing who guides them.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:\n*\"Heaven’s movement is without action,\nyet its clarity is pure and unadulterated—\nit nurtures life and covers all without fail.\nEarth’s dwelling is without action,\nyet its stillness is unchanging—\nit bears form and sustains all without omission.\nPure and unadulterated clarity is evident,\ntranquil stillness is evident—\nall this comes from attaining the Way of non-action.\nHeaven and Earth blend in their non-action,\nand all things transform and arise.\nObserving Heaven and Earth reveals the Sage—\nwhat need is there for action?\nThe Sage merely follows Heaven and Earth.*\n\nThus, the violent and fierce transform into the yielding,\nthose who bend to private interests transform into the public-spirited,\nand all who harbor criminal intent\nare led to pursue their own solitary ambition—\nthe people daily reform,\nyet do not know who guides them.\n\n*\"I cherish stillness, and the people align themselves.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"The balance’s interaction with form\nrequires no contrivance of skill,\nyet straight and round, curved and right cannot escape it—\nhow much more so does it need hooks, cords, or measuring tools\nbefore things can be made straight?\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:\n*\"If the balance is clear, dust and filth cannot cling;\nif the water is still, even whiskers and eyebrows are reflected.\nThe balance and the water achieve this\nbecause they remain singular and unchanging,\nsteady and responsive in nature.\nThe *Classic* says:\n*'The balance’s interaction with form\nrequires no contrivance of skill,\nyet straight and round, curved and right cannot escape it'—*\nthis speaks of its stillness.\nThe Sage’s use of the heart\nis like this:\nhe guards stillness with unwavering devotion,\nyet does not let movement disrupt his nature—\nsimply following his natural course,\nundisturbed and unruffled.\nHow much more so does he need hooks, cords, or measuring tools\nbefore things can be made straight?\"*\n\nThus, the Way of governance values clarity and stillness,\nand the people naturally align themselves.\nThe *Classic* states:\n*\"Clarity and stillness are the rectification for all under heaven.\"*\n\n*\"I act without interference, and the people grow rich.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"The world is originally without interference—\nit is only the vulgar who disturb it.\nIf one does not disturb it,\nthe people will naturally grow rich.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:\n*\"To govern a great nation is like cooking a small fresh fish—\nif one overcooks it, the fish spoils;\nif one overgoverns the people, they become confused.\nThe Sage pardons all under heaven,\nforgetting distinctions in Dao/Way and skill,\nlike fish forgetting the rivers and lakes—\nthen there is no interference,\nand life flourishes in order.\nIs not the Way of enriching the people\nfound in this absence of interference?\nYet the world is originally without interference—\nit is only the vulgar who disturb it.\nThose who later alter the ancient ways\nand disrupt the established order to invite disaster\ndo not understand the Way of enriching the people.\"*\n\n*\"I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"If one does not prize the virtuous,\nthe people will not vie for them;\nif one does not value hard-to-obtain goods,\nthe people will not become thieves—\nthis aligns with having no desires,\nand thus the people’s nature is preserved.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:\n*\"To promote the virtuous leads the people to compete;\nthus, by not prizing the virtuous,\nthe people do not vie for them.\nHard-to-obtain goods provoke obstruction;\nthus, by not valuing hard-to-obtain goods,\nthe people do not become thieves.\nIf one does not prize the virtuous\nand does not value goods,\nthen the people see nothing to desire.\nThe Sage’s use of the heart\naligns with having no desires—\nthis is called *substance-simplicity*,\nand substance-simplicity preserves the people’s nature.\n\n*Substance-simplicity* is the complete embodiment of the Dao,\nbefore it disperses into things.\nIf the people return to their simplicity,\nthey see the Dao and not things,\nand what they see surpasses what they merely observe.\nIf one cannot abandon desires and dispel longings,\none will still be ensnared by things—\none will still be bound by the threads of artificiality,\none will still be enslaved by the schemes of others—\nthen the people lose their simplicity,\ndrowning in human artifice—\nhow could they ever restore the ancient winds of virtue?\"\n\nThe *Laozi* wrote:\n*\"Do not see what is desirable,\nso that the heart does not become disturbed.\"*\n*\"No greater crime than desiring what is desirable.\"*\n*\"Fewer private concerns and lesser desires—\nfor desires harm nature,\nand they must be dispelled.\"*\n\nThe *Mencius* said:\n*\"When it comes to being human,\nthose with many desires,\neven if they have some virtue,\nare few indeed.\"*\n\nIts governance is obscure and profound—\nthe fifty-eighth chapter—\nits governance is obscure and profound...\n\nIn governing with leniency, the people know of it,\nyet they lack the joy of exultation.\n\nThe *Commentary* explains:\n\"The world has innate *virtue/power* (*德*), and each *virtue/power* has its natural *qi* (*性*).\nIt cannot be forced—\nto force it is to contrive (*伪*),\nit cannot be disturbed—\nto disturb it brings anxiety.\nOnly by letting *qi* unfold without excess,\nand by granting leniency so that *virtue/power* does not stray,\ncan one bring the whole world to a realm of tranquil simplicity (*澹汉*).\nThen the people will all say, 'He governs us naturally,'\nas the *Laozi* described when he said,\n'*The people know of it* yet it brings them no exultation.'\n\nWhen the people know of it,\ntheir *qi* does not grow more vital,\ntheir *virtue/power* does not diminish—\nrelaxed and harmonious, without exultation,\nyet they still hold praise beyond measure.\n\nDid the *Mencius* say:\n'*The people of a king are pure and bright* (*皡皡如也*).\nIs this not the governance of tranquil simplicity?'\n\nAs for the people being sincere (*淳淳*):\nThe *Huizong* annotation says:\n'*Seeing simplicity and embracing naturalness, few private concerns and lesser desires.*'\n\nThe *Commentary* explains:\n'*Simplicity and naturalness* (*素朴*) are the people’s innate *qi*.\nTo see and embrace it,\nthen purity and clarity remain unadulterated,\nstillness and unity unchanging,\nand they reach the point of *illuminating clarity* (*明白入素*),\nwhere governance is effortless and naturalness restored.\n\n*Private desires* (*私欲*) are the people’s emotions.\nTo have few private concerns and lesser desires,\nthen they conquer themselves in victory,\nexcel in nurturing the heart,\nand reach the point of *turning from self for the public* (*背私为公*),\nwhere they no longer see what is desirable.\nNo greater sincerity than this.\n\nAs for governance being *clear and strict* (*察察*),\n\n*Huizong* annotation says:\n\"To issue simple orders and enforce them strictly—like combing hair after loosening it, or counting grains before cooking—\nthis is to take petty matters as brilliance (*窃窃然以苛为明*), the very essence of *clear and strict* governance.\"\n\nThe *Commentary* explains:\n\"The key to governance lies in the *Dao*, which must not be burdensome.\nThe Sage governs through the *Dao* in the world,\nby assuming the utmost *emptiness* (*至虚*) to welcome the myriad forms of reality,\nand by embodying the utmost *stillness* (*至静*) to receive the ceaseless movements of life—\nthus achieving simplicity yet effectiveness.\nThey never resort to issuing simple orders and enforcing them strictly,\nnor take petty matters as brilliance.\n\nIndeed, issuing simple orders and enforcing them strictly\nexhausts the spirit in trivial affairs,\nand wearies the mind in insignificant matters.\nTo take petty matters as brilliance,\nhow can this suffice to benefit the world?\n\nThus, the *Dao* of governance values *clarity and stillness* (*清静*), letting the people regulate themselves.\nWhen the people are *confused and restless* (*缺缺*),\n\n*Huizong* annotation says:\n\"To elevate the worthy brings strife among the people (*举贤则民相轧*),\nto entrust the clever leads to theft among the people (*任知则民相盗*),\nthus there is no *full virtue* (*全德*).\"\n\nThe *Commentary* explains:\n\"The Sage’s governance always ensures the people have no knowledge nor desires.\nTo elevate the worthy, the people will vie and compete (*跨跂而相轧*),\nunable to settle their *fate’s distinctions* (*性命之分*);\nto entrust the clever, the people will covet and plunder (*觊觎而相盗*),\nunable to quiet their *fate’s emotions* (*性命之情*).\n\nThis is the peril of knowledge and desire (*有知有欲之为患*),\nand the reason the people are led astray by external things (*迁於物*).\nWhen led astray by external things,\nit is insufficient to enrich the people,\nthus there is no *full virtue*.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n\"*Full virtue* preserves the body (*德全者形全*),\nand failing to preserve *full virtue*,\nnourishing the body cannot sustain life—\nthis is what is meant by *the body’s essence being greatly depleted* (*形精大亏*),’\nis it not the state of the people being *confused and restless* (*缺缺*)?\n\n*Misfortune* and *fortune* are interdependent (*祸兮福所倚，福兮祸所伏*),\nwho knows their limits?\n\n*Huizong* annotation says:\n\"*Illuminating clarity* (*昭昭*) arises from *obscurity* (*冥冥*),\nand *order* (*有伦*) emerges from *formlessness* (*无形*).\n*Virtue* and *wisdom* guard against *intellect*,\nand their essence lies in *sickness and health* (*疢疾*).\nIn households of *high clarity* (*高明之家*),\nspirits survey their halls (*鬼瞰其室*),\nfor they know time cannot be halted,\nranks cannot be fixed,\nand beginnings and endings cannot be rigidly predetermined—\nthus, the interdependence of *misfortune* and *fortune*,\nwhat constancy can there be?\n\nThe *Commentary* explains:\nWithin *emptiness* and *stillness* (*虚静*),\nthe Great Transformation subtly shifts (*大化密移*),\nfrom hidden to revealed (*由隐而之显*),\nfrom nonexistence to manifestation (*自无而适有*).\nIf one lacks the true Sovereign yet fails to discern its signs (*不得其朕*),\nthen *illuminating clarity* arises from *obscurity*,\nand *order* emerges from *formlessness*.\n\nThe *spirit* (*精神*) in its manifestation is *illuminating clarity*,\nyet the *Dao*’s ultimate truth remains *formless*;\nthe *essence* (*精*) of things, once fully realized, is *formless*,\nbut their *order* (*有伦*) in completion reveals *form*.\n\nThe principles of *misfortune* and *fortune*\nare concealed in the depths of existence,\nresponding like echoes and shadows (*应若影响*),\nor the silent operation of the Transformative Mechanism (*化机*).\nOnly those who *penetrate* (*达者*) know\nthat *benefit* can generate *harm* (*利足以生害*),\nand *joy* can breed *sorrow* (*乐足以生忧*).\nThus, they can apply *intellect* (*智*) at the outset,\nbefore chaos has taken root (*未奔沈之初*),\nand illuminate the path\namidst the faint and fleeting (*忽眇绵*),\nso that *spontaneity* (*诞先*) may ascend\nto the realm of effortless virtue (*无难之地*).\n\nThe *Mencius* warns of *breathing with caution* (*虑息之戒*), saying:\n\"*Virtue* and *wisdom* shield against *intellect*,\nand their essence lies in *sickness and health* (*德慧卫智，存乎疢疾*),\"\nwhile *Yang Xiong*’s *Self-Parody* (*解嘲论*) states:\n\"*High clarity* households are watched by spirits (*高明之家，鬼瞰其室*),\"\nboth penetrating this very truth.\n\nIndeed, *virtue* and *wisdom* shield against *intellect*—\nthis can be called *clear and sagacious* (*明哲*),\nyet they still hold *sickness and health* (*疢疾*) as their core,\nfor the *gentleman* must anticipate calamities and prepare defenses (*思患而豫防*).\n\n*High clarity* households can be free of worry (*无虞*),\nyet they must speak of spirits watching their halls (*鬼瞰其室*),\nfor spirits bring harm to the overfilled and fortune to the modest (*害盈而福谦*).\n\nObserving this,\none must know that time cannot be halted (*时无止*),\nranks cannot be fixed (*分无常*),\nand beginnings and endings cannot be rigidly predetermined (*终始无故*),\nfor this is the path to true understanding.\n\nTo know time cannot be halted,\none remains distant yet unconstrained (*遥而不闷*),\ngathering without strain (*掇而不跂*);\nto know ranks cannot be fixed,\none discerns excess and deficiency (*察乎盈虚*),\nand neither gain nor loss can perturb the heart (*得失不足以撄其心*);\nto know beginnings and endings cannot be rigidly predetermined,\none comprehends the way of *effortless spontaneity* (*坦涂*),\nand neither death nor life can burden the heart (*死生不足以累其心*).\n\nWhen time cannot be halted,\none passes through without lingering;\nwhen ranks cannot be fixed,\none adapts without clinging;\nwhen beginnings and endings cannot be rigidly predetermined,\none never finds fault—\nthus, *misfortune* and *fortune* are interdependent,\nmutually consuming and growing (*相为消长*),\nwhat constancy can there be?\n\nIt is said that *fortune* is the beginning of *misfortune*,\nand *misfortune* is the stage for *fortune*—\nthis is because their constancy is ever-changing, never fixed (*无常未始有极*).\n\nWhat of *right* and *wrong*?\n*Huizong* annotation says:\n\"If those who are *same* as me and you (*我与若*) are *right*,\nthen *winter* is *right* (*正冬*).\nIf they are *same* as me and you,\nhow can they be *right*?\nIf those who are *different* from me and you are *right*,\nthen *right* them.\nIf they are *different* from me and you,\nhow can they be *right*?\nThen who can be the *ultimate right* for the world?\"\n\nThe *Commentary* explains:\nThe world’s *right* and *wrong* (*是非*)\nare nothing but the *same* and *different* between me and you (*我与若相为同异*).\nIf those who are *same* as me and you are *right*,\nthen *right* them.\nYet if they are *same* as me and you,\nthen both are *right*—\nhow can they be *right*?\n\nIf those who are *different* from me and you are *right*,\nthen *right* them.\nYet if they are *different* from me and you,\nthen both are *wrong*—\nhow can they be *right*?\n\nIf neither me nor you can truly know each other,\nthen who can know the *ultimate right* of the world?\n\nIf one cannot discern the *ultimate right*,\nthen their *body* knows only comfort and ease (*安佚*),\nbut not the *right* place to be (*正处*);\ntheir *mouth* knows only coarse and fine tastes (*刍豢*),\nbut not the *right* flavor (*正味*);\ntheir *eyes* know only beautiful colors (*美色*),\nbut not the *right* hues (*正色*).\nThis is the failure to attain *right* knowledge (*正知*).\n\nThus, the path of *right* and *wrong*,\nhow can I know its true distinctions?\n\n*Right* becomes *strange* (*奇*),\n*good* becomes *disastrous* (*祆*).\nThe people’s confusion (*迷*)\nhas been long since established.\n\n「Emperor Huizong annotated: The world is but one *qi* in flow. What was *right* today may be *wrong* tomorrow; what was once *united* may later be *disjointed*. The divine and the foul, the fragrant and the putrid, arise in perpetual succession—thus, the *strange* and the *right* intergenerate, the *disastrous* and the *good* transform in cycles, all as the natural unfolding of one *qi*.\n\nThe world’s formation has endured long, yet minor confusions invert directions—turning east to west, facing the *Dark Mountain* yet failing to see it; great confusions distort nature—mistaking the nonexistent for the real, abandoning the *Mysterious Pearl* yet never seeking it. The habit of self-interest prevails, blinding them to the *curved* and the *straight*; they fail to grasp the *inverted* and *upright* interplay of calamity and fortune. Moreover, they scrutinize with rigid precision, yet only deepen their bewilderment—unresponsive, unenlightened. How then can the people return to their true essence?\n\nThus, Laozi composed the *Political Confusion* chapter, intending to guide the people back to simplicity and purity, to return to their true nature.\n\nHence, the Sage remains *square* yet does not cleave: Emperor Huizong annotated: *Square* means steadfast in discernment, yet the *Great Square* has no corners—still yet fluid, leaving no trace of rigid distinctions. The *Cushioned Explanation* states: Those bound by *square* forms cling to fixed views, differing from customs; this is the “steadfast in discernment” of which we speak. *Steadfast* here aligns with the *I Ching*’s “interposed” (*jiè*), as in *interposed* between stones. The *Great Square* has no bounds—no south nor north, its vastness dissolving in all directions, sufficient to answer the *unbounded* Way. It is not like those who cling to *square* forms, treating them as mere *vessels*.\n\nThe Sage remains *still* yet does not stagnate: This mirrors the *Great Stillness* above, untouched by fluctuations, like water settled in repose. The master carpenter takes its form as law, leaving no path of rigid distinctions—is this not what Confucius called “first stabilizing, then responding”?\n\nThe Sage remains *honest* yet does not excess: Emperor Huizong annotated: *Honest* yet excessive breeds arrogance; radiant yet blinding invites ruin. The Sage holds *straightness* within yet bends without, wielding light yet returning to clarity—only the Sage can do so.\n\nThe people’s confusion lies in treating *square* as *right*—like the *Child Mo* who clings to the center, or the *Middle Son* who holds to rigid virtue. They know extension yet not contraction, prominence yet not subtlety, and thus lose the Sage’s *Great Harmony*, boasting of superficial customs while neglecting the whole. How can they rectify the world?\n\nWhat then is the Sage’s method to rectify the world? Simply this.\n\nThe Sage remains *clean* yet does not exclude: Emperor Huizong annotated: *Clean* yet excluding leads to harshness; the *Great Honest* is unobstructed, pure yet receptive, without rigid judgment. The *Cushioned Explanation* states: Those who guard their *cleanliness* with caution often pride themselves in self-purification—this is the “pride in self-purification” of which we speak. *Pride* here aligns with the *Analects*’ “the ancient *pride*” in *clean* conduct. The *Great Honest* is unobstructed, fully content without further demands, serene in self-sufficiency, rejecting the laborious and difficult. It is not like those who cling to *clean* yet fail to trust—rather, it is like the *Analects*’ “victorious yet unharmed.”\n\nThe Sage remains *bright* yet does not dazzle.»\n\n「The *Cushioned Explanation* states: If one is rigid in self-righteousness and calls it *straightforwardness*, then *straightforwardness* will inevitably indulge one’s emotions, giving rise to the arrogance of trampling others. Only by abandoning the burdens of extreme rectitude and avoiding the faults of crookedness and strain can one achieve *straightforwardness* without indulgence. When applied to things, it moves flexibly and adaptably, never clashing with the world, and thus the arrogance of trampling others does not arise.\n\nIf one takes delight in pleasing the crowd and calls it *brightness*, then *brightness* will inevitably dazzle with outward display, inviting the calamity of boasting. Only by discarding the superficial brilliance of contrived appearances and the ostentatious glare of insincere flattery can one attain *brightness* without dazzle. When its radiance is used to illuminate action, it follows the times and conforms to things, never forcing the heart’s accord, and thus the calamity of boasting does not arise. This is how one remains *straightforward* inwardly yet *flexible* outwardly, wielding its *brightness* while restoring its *clarity*—this is the unique way of the Sage.\n\nIndeed, inward *straightforwardness* is what aligns one with the *Dao* of Heaven. Outward *flexibility* is what harmonizes one with humanity. Only the fully *flexible* and *crooked* can achieve *straightness*—this is the Sage’s virtue. Wielding its *brightness* reveals all *Ren* (benevolence). Restoring its *clarity* conceals the subtleties of application. Only those who follow the manifest yet grasp the hidden, and who discern the pivotal yet remain in the mysterious, can achieve this.\n\nFor the Sage alone can harmonize with Heaven, humanity, and the divine *clarity*. Their virtue cannot be matched by others. As for the people’s confusion, it has long been so. Those who cling to *rigid* principles as truth, like **Zǐ Mò** (子莫) who grasped the *Middle*, cannot adapt with expedience and thus discard the hundred for the one. Those who prize *upright* conduct as truth, like **Zhòngzǐ** (仲子) who upheld *purity*, cannot fulfill its broader scope and thus stain themselves while disrupting harmony. To yield is *crookedness*; to advance is *extension*. Knowing *extension* yet not *crookedness*, one is fixed in rigidity and cannot harmonize with the natural flow—how then can one know *crookedness* and *extension* in mutual accord, as in the *Book of Changes*’ “beneficial for use, secure in abiding”?\n\nThe *hidden* is the *profound*; the *manifest* is the *displayed*. Knowing only the *displayed* yet not the *profound*, one is trapped in superficiality and cannot inherit its *clarity*—how then can one know the *profound* and the *displayed*, as in the *Book of Changes*’ “discerning the few, this is the divine”?\n\n**Zǐ Mò**’s grasp of the *Middle*, **Zhòngzǐ**’s rigid *purity*, knowing only *extension* yet not *crookedness*, knowing only the *displayed* yet not the *profound*—all these are blinded by private bias, narrow and incomplete. They strain their intentions and boast of their conduct to flaunt the flaws of the age, losing the Sage’s full completeness. They do not see the pure and complete essence of Heaven, Earth, and the ancient worthies—how can they rectify the world?\n\nThis is the failure to rectify oneself while presuming to rectify others—clearly, they do not comprehend what is possible. The Sage’s way of rectifying the world is simply this: *rigid* yet not divisive, *upright* yet not rigidly harsh, *straightforward* yet not indulgent, *bright* yet not dazzling.\n\nThe Sage embodies the complete beauty of the *Dao*, holding fast to the *One* as the model for the world. By extending this, rectifying the world’s true essence becomes a mere formality. This is how **Great Shun** could rectify all beings, achieving governance through *non-action*.\n\n**Chapter 59: Rectifying Humanity and Serving Heaven**\n\nRectifying humanity and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses *frugality*.\n\nEmperor Huizong annotated: *Hearing* (聪明) and *intelligence* (智识) are Heaven’s gifts. *Action* (动) and *rest** (静), *thought* (思), and *deliberation* (虑) are human affairs. Adjusting the measures of *action* and *rest*, moderating the burdens of *thought* and *deliberation*—this is how one rectifies humanity. Not exhausting the power of *hearing* nor fully depleting the capacity of *intelligence*—this is how one serves Heaven. This is called *frugality*.\n\nThe *One* of Heaven resides in the *zàng* organs (脏), with the *kidneys* (肾) as its domain. Established in the *unyielding field* (不贷之圃), when *intelligence* is abundant and *frugality* flows, humanity is rectified and Heaven’s *principle* is attained.\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: To know what Heaven does and what humanity does—this is the ultimate. Thus, in attaining the natural, there is no action not of Heaven; in observing expedience, there is no action not of humanity. *Hearing* and *intelligence* arise from the natural and are perfected by Heaven, hence **Han Fei** said: *Hearing* and *intelligence* are Heaven’s gifts. *Action* and *rest*, *thought* and *deliberation*, emerge from expedience and are rooted in humanity, hence **Han Fei** said: *Action* and *rest*, *thought* and *deliberation* are human affairs. To rectify humanity and serve Heaven, one must first prioritize *frugality*—for *action* and *rest* have their constants, the true *principle*. What one thinks and deliberates is the ultimate *Dao*. Adjusting the measures of *action* and *rest* ensures that *action* occurs only at its proper time. Moderating the burdens of *thought* and *deliberation* leads to a tranquil, ever-serene state. Observing expedience in human affairs—this is *frugality* in its essence.\n\nTo abandon *hearing* is to align with the *Great Harmony* (大通). To discard *intelligence* is to follow Heaven’s *principle*. Not exhausting the power of *hearing* allows one to *withdraw sight* and *return hearing* (收视反听). Not fully depleting the capacity of *intelligence* enables one to *revert to simplicity* and *return to purity* (还淳复朴). Attaining the natural in Heaven’s affairs—this too is *frugality*.\n\nIndeed, the *One* of Heaven generates *water* (水), which in humanity is *essence* (精). The *kidneys* are the *zàng* organ that houses *essence*. The *One* of Heaven resides in the *zàng*, its origin rooted in the *unyielding field*—hence the *kidneys* are its domain. Yet it does not depart from *essence*, for this is the way of the *Divine Person* (神人). Thus, in rectifying humanity and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses *frugality*.\n\nEstablished in the *unyielding field*, one fears only excess. When *intelligence* is abundant and *frugality* flows, it does not waste itself in virtue. By this means, humanity is rectified and Heaven’s *principle* is attained. Only through *frugality* does one achieve early restoration.\n\nEmperor Huizong annotated: Restoration comes late when one awakens from confusion. If one seeks restoration before confusion sets in, *frugality* does not waste itself in human nature—thus, restoration comes early.\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: To attain one’s *nature* (性) is to perpetuate life endlessly; to lose one’s *nature* is to fail in perpetuation and reach exhaustion. To return to one’s original *nature* and restore its essence, one must value swift restoration. Restoration after confusion is far removed from the original *nature*—this is the people’s long-standing confusion, the cause of their late awakening.»\n\n「Observe the thunder within the earth—it is *Fù* (復) in the *Hexagram*, yet the first line of nine states: *\"No regret, supreme auspiciousness.\"* But the top line of six becomes ominous. For the first line’s *Fù* is near, while the top line’s *Fù* comes only after confusion has taken hold.\n\nThe *Hexagram of Fù* (比) likewise: the first line speaks of *\"There is another,\"* auspicious; the sixth line declares *\"Fù without a head,\"* ominous. This is because *Fù* and *Bǐ* (比) prefer to act early.\n\nTo practice *frugality* is to not waste one’s *nature* (性), and when *nature* is yet near its source, restoration comes early. Early restoration is called *accumulating virtue* (重积德).\n\nEmperor Huizong annotated: *Fù* (復) is the root of virtue. When one restores through self-awareness, the Dao within us grows daily and ever renews.\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: Virtue is attainment. Attainment from one’s *nature* is what is meant. To observe *Fù* (復) in the midst of the *common multitude* (芸芸), to *Fù* (復) at the very moment of *adversity* (挠挠), is to never stray from one’s *nature*. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *Fù* (復), the root of virtue.\n\nIf one can restore to its root, then *nature* is cultivated and virtue is perfected, and wisdom will never fail to illuminate. Thus, the *Book of Changes* again says: *Fù* (復) with self-awareness. Therefore, when one does not waste one’s *nature* and restores early, virtue grows daily and becomes vast.\n\nThe *Classic of Documents* (《书》) says: Virtue is renewed daily, and again renewed daily. *Accumulating virtue* (重积德) means none can overcome it.\n\nEmperor Huizong annotated: To conquer is to prevail. To govern all things and command the myriad movements without any that cannot be overcome—this is virtue alone.\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: When virtue is complete within oneself, one does not seek to conquer others but prevails over all. Thus, within oneself it is abundant, and when bestowed upon others, there is still surplus. In its operation and response, it is boundless and universally applicable, its radiance extending to the four quarters and reaching both above and below. Who can know its limits?\n\nMencius said: Virtue’s teachings overflow abundantly, permeating the four seas. If none can know its limits, one can have a kingdom. Emperor Huizong annotated: When virtue is fully realized and boundless, its application to the world is effortless. How much more so for a single kingdom?\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: The true Dao begins with governing oneself; its excess is applied to the state, and its fullness extends to the world. When virtue reaches the stage of *Fù* (復) in its original state, it is boundless and pure. This is what Zhuangzi called *exhausting the whole to achieve unity* (周尽一体). Though the world is vast, it lies within one’s grasp, so its application to the world is effortless. How much more so for a small kingdom?\n\nThe mother of having a kingdom can endure forever. Emperor Huizong annotated: The Dao is the mother of all things, and those who possess the Dao will never falter throughout the ages.\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: The world has a beginning, and this beginning is the mother of the world. Thus, the Dao is the mother of all things. From formed existence to formlessness, from having a mind to being mindless, all arise from it. Hence, it is called the mother.\n\nThe mother of having a kingdom is the possession of the Dao. Those who attain the Dao transcend time, enduring forever without flaw—what is this if not longevity and eternal vision?\n\nEmperor Huizong annotated: The Dao is the mother of all things, and all things are its offspring. *Nature* (性) is the root of form, and form is its foundation. Knowing its offspring and guarding its mother, one will not perish in life. Thus, one can endure forever. A deep root secures its foundation; restoring *nature* preserves form. Aligned with Heaven and Earth, one attains eternal life. Sharing light with the sun and moon, one attains eternal vision. When all things transform while I alone remain, this is called the Dao.\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: There are beings, and there are beings that give rise to all things. The former are things; the latter is the Dao. The text says: *\"The named is the mother of all things.\"* Zhuangzi said: *\"All things flourish and grow from non-action.\"* Thus, the Dao is the mother of all things, and all things are its offspring.\n\nThere are forms, and there are forms that give rise to forms. Forms are the physical; forms that give rise to forms are *nature* (性). Zhuangzi said: *\"Nature is the essence of life.\"* Liuzi said: *\"Form is the vessel of life.\"* Thus, *nature* is the root of form, and form is its foundation.\n\nThe mother of having a kingdom is the one who knows its offspring and guards its mother. Guarding its mother means uniting with the Dao, enduring through all ages and remaining constant. Thus, one will not perish in life and can endure forever.\n\nNow, take the growth of grasses and trees: deep roots secure their foundations, just as in humans, restoring *nature* preserves form. Only by preserving form can one ensure life’s vitality without exhaustion, like grasses and trees rooted in the earth, enduring without end. Thus, aligned with Heaven and Earth, one attains eternal life, and wisdom never ceases, like the sun and moon sharing their light, one attains eternal vision.\n\nWhen all things transform while I alone remain, this is to transcend form and not transform with it, to depart from fate and not perish with it—this is called the Dao.\n\nChapter Sixty of *The Great Learning* (《记》):\nTo govern a great kingdom, one must act as if cooking a small fish.」\n\n「Huizong’s annotation states: When dealing with the multitude and often disturbing them, success will be rare. When storing great treasures and frequently moving them, many will be damaged. When cooking a small fish and constantly stirring it, it will be ruined. When ruling a great state and frequently altering its laws, confusion will arise. Therefore, the Dao of governance values clarity and stillness, and the people will naturally settle.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: If a ruler favors strictness, all affairs will be meticulous; if he favors meticulousness, all affairs will become chaotic. Hence, the ruler’s Dao lies in governing with singular focus—if he knows how to govern one thing properly, then all other matters will follow in order. Thus, it is natural that dealing with the multitude and often disturbing them yields little success, and storing great treasures while frequently moving them leads to many damages.\n\nIndeed, the world has its fixed ways: to follow them brings order, to disrupt them brings worry. Only by not disrupting Heaven’s natural course and not opposing the inclinations of things can one establish laws that are firm and unchanging, avoiding the flaw of issuing morning decrees and evening reversals. Then, the world will be well-governed. Just as with cooking fish—if one constantly stirs it, it will spoil—so too, ruling a great state by frequently altering its laws will surely bring confusion.\n\n*The Classic of Transmission* says: If the people trust in their laws, they will be obedient. This is the virtue of ancient sages in lawmaking: their decrees were steadfast as metal and stone, reliable as the four seasons, and never changed.\n\nTherefore, by remaining unadulterated and clear, embracing the Way with tranquility, the people will have no need for governance and will settle naturally. Hence, the Dao of governance values clarity and stillness, and the people will naturally settle. Who would willingly multiply laws and edicts to burden the masses?\n\nThose who govern the world with the Way, their spirits are not malevolent. Huizong’s annotation states: The sage is the Way’s sovereign over all people and things. When compelled to govern the world, the best course is *wuwei* (non-action). The Way is ever in non-action, yet through non-action, all things are governed. Those who rely on others to act will also find stability and rest, none rising to cause misfortune, hence it is said that their spirits are not malevolent.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: The *Book of Poetry* says, *\"A hundred spirits obey you.\"* The *Book of Documents* says, *\"Only the primordial sovereign acts as parent and mother to the people.\"* Zhuangzi says, *\"The sage is the pivot upon which all things hinge.\"* Thus, the sage is indeed the Way’s sovereign over all people and things. Yet, it is easy for me to forget the world, but difficult for the world to forget me. The reason the sage emerges to guide the world is but a dwelling in necessity, a temporary abode.\n\nWhen compelled to govern the world, what else is there to do but maintain reverence and uprightness? Then, through non-action alone, the people’s lives will be at peace, and they will transform naturally. Thus, none will remain ungoverned. Those who rely on others to act and yet claim to be the Way’s sovereign will find their own support and ease, all settling into stability and rest, none rising to cause misfortune—like the *Book of Poetry* says, *\"The ancestral spirits come to rest, their fragrance lingering.\"* Hence, it is said that their spirits are not malevolent.\n\nIt is not that their spirits are not malevolent, but that the Way’s spirit does not harm the people. It is not that the Way’s spirit does not harm the people, but that the sage also does not harm the people. When the two do not harm each other, their virtue reciprocally returns.\n\nHuizong’s annotation states: Those who govern the world with the Way do nothing yet everything is naturally so—there are no wars of aggression, no punishments of slaughter. This is what is meant by \"not harming the people.\"\n\nIn such times, the Way’s spirit and the people’s spirit do not harm each other, and virtue reciprocally returns. The Way’s spirit has no need to manifest its divine influence, but only bestows abundant blessings, hence it is said that the Way’s spirit does not harm the people. The people need not exert their cleverness, for their daily lives are but sustenance and nourishment—how could there be any harm?\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: The Way is ever in non-action yet accomplishes all. If one governs the world with the Way, one follows its inherent nature without imposing artificial disruptions—this is what is meant by *\"doing nothing yet everything is naturally so.\"* Protecting the people as a father, viewing them as a mother, never resorting to arms—thus there is no calamity of war. Punishments are set aside and unused—thus there are no executions. The Way’s spirit and the people’s spirit do not harm each other, and the bright are without human censure, the hidden without ghostly blame. Then virtue reciprocally returns, for the Way’s spirit has no need to manifest its divine influence, but only bestows abundant blessings, as the *Book of Poetry* says, *\"The Way’s spirit descends in sorrow.\"* The people need not exert their cleverness, for their daily lives are but sustenance and nourishment—like the *Book of Poetry* says, *\"The people are simple.\"* How could there be any harm?\n\nChapter Sixty-One of *The Classic of Transmission*:\nGreat states are the lower reaches of the rivers...」\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"No one lacks the inclination toward the high, yet those who pursue the high often stumble.\"* The rivers and seas become the sovereigns of all valleys because they excel in yielding. The *Cunyi* commentary explains: *\"A nine-tiered tower begins with piled earth; to ascend high, one must start from below. Knowing that the high depends on the low as its foundation, one avoids stumbling by not elevating without a base.\"* Merely desiring the high while neglecting the low is to love the high without attaining it—how could one not stumble?\n\nWater does not accumulate without forming depths; rivers and seas become great by receiving all streams. Thus, they reign over all valleys, and waters pay homage to them because they excel in yielding. Then, is it not the case that a state’s greatness lies in its yielding, and its governance follows accordingly?\n\nThe meeting place of all under Heaven, the feminine of all under Heaven—\nthe feminine always overcomes the masculine through stillness,\nand stillness is the way of yielding.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"While all others rely on strength to contend, I alone dwell in the realm of gentle stillness and non-contention—who then can overcome me?\"* This is the Dao of harmonizing with all under Heaven. The *Classic* says: *\"Knowing the masculine, one holds to the feminine, thus becoming the valley of all under Heaven.\"*\n\nThe *Cunyi* commentary explains: *\"From the perspective of things, only the low can support, only the yielding can prevail. This is the inherent principle: those who rely on fierceness and exploit others, thinking to rise above, merely court ruin. The constant way of victory lies in yielding; the constant way of defeat lies in rigidity.\"*\n\nAll under Heaven rely on strength to contend, yet the Sage adopts weakness, humility, and yielding as his standard. Dwelling in stillness and non-contention, he retreats only to lead, withdraws only to endure. Though he does not seek to overcome others, none can overcome him—this is the Dao of harmonizing with all under Heaven. The *Classic* says: *\"Knowing the masculine, one holds to the feminine, thus becoming the valley of all under Heaven.\"* Indeed, knowing the way to overcome, yet dwelling in yielding stillness, all things must yield to it—because of its stillness.\n\nThus, when great states yield to small states, they take the small states;\nwhen small states yield to great states, they take the great states.\nHence, sometimes one yields to take, sometimes one yields and takes.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"To gather, one must first disperse; to take, one must first give.\"*\n\nThe *Cunyi* commentary explains: *\"There is contraction and expansion, fullness and emptiness—this is not only human affairs but the natural order of Heaven. Only those who perceive these subtle shifts beforehand know that to gather, one must first disperse, understanding that contraction and expansion mutually consume each other; to take, one must first give, knowing that fullness and emptiness follow as beginning and end.\"*\n\nThus, great states yield to small states with the affairs of greatness, and small states yield to great states with the affairs of smallness—each attains what it desires. Then, to rise above others, one must speak of yielding, yet the gentleman does not wish to rise above many—precisely for this reason.\n\nGreat states seek only to nurture others, small states seek only to serve others—both attain what they desire, hence the great should yield.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The Dao of Heaven is yielding yet illuminates all; thus it treads without failing. The Dao of Earth is low yet ascends; thus it sustains Heaven.\"* Human affairs follow Earth, Earth follows Heaven—hence the great should yield.\n\nThe *Cunyi* commentary explains: *\"The Dao of Heaven yields yet nourishes all, its light covering without bound. The Dao of Earth is low yet ascends, sustaining the seasons of Heaven.\"* Practicing the way of humility and openness, even Heaven and Earth do so—how much more so for humanity? Emperor Yao shone with sincere reverence, his virtue reaching to the four quarters; Emperor Shun ascended with gentle humility, his profound virtue heard in Heaven. All this is but following the ways of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Three Powers occupy distinct positions, yet their ways are one—\nthus the Sage does not exalt himself, following Earth,\nand so achieves effortless success for all under Heaven.\nEarth does not exalt itself, following Heaven,\nand so nurtures all things without striving.\nThus, not exalting oneself is the way to achieve greatness—\nthis is the constant truth.\n\nHence, the great should yield—is it not so?\n\n*The Commentary on the Dao De Jing* concludes, Volume Eleven.\n*The Commentary on the Dao De Jing* begins, Volume Twelve.\n\n**The Scholar Jiang Cheng’s Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* – Chapter Sixty-Two: *The Dao as the Hidden Essence of All Things***\n\nThe Dao is the hidden essence of all things.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation:\nThe hidden essence of Heaven lies in the west-north, where the vital essence condenses.\nThe hidden essence of Earth lies in the Yellow Springs, where the spirit-forms conceal themselves.\nThe hidden essence of humanity lies in thought and deliberation, where the supreme spirit is nurtured.\n\nHeaven, Earth, and humanity each possess their hidden essences, yet all are encompassed by the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom, difficult to measure, and difficult to recognize—thus it is the hidden essence of all things.\n\nIf the Dao is the hidden essence of all things, then are not all things the manifest expression of the Dao?\n\n*The Commentary* states:\nThe Dao’s hidden nature is unfathomably deep—like the innermost chamber of a hall, sealed in profound secrecy, or like the depths of the Qi River, concealed and locked away. All that is perverse and manifest yet enters into concealment possesses its hidden essence. In the *Taiyuan* [section], the Three Models are discussed precisely to speak of their hidden depths.\n\nHeaven’s hidden essence lies in the unseen—its west-north corresponds to the *Kan* hexagram, returning to the utmost stillness, where the vital essence condenses. When the vital essence condenses, the movement of *qi* becomes subtle and concealed; when the sun meets the moon, it is obscured—thus it is said: *The hidden essence of Heaven lies in the west-north, where the vital essence condenses.*\n\nEarth’s hidden essence lies in the formless—its Yellow Springs are unfathomably deep, plunged into the utmost darkness, where the spirit-forms conceal themselves. When the spirit-forms conceal themselves, the *yang* energy germinates in secret, hiding its form—thus it is said: *The hidden essence of Earth lies in the Yellow Springs, where the spirit-forms conceal themselves.*\n\nHumanity’s hidden essence lies in the heart and abdomen—thought and deliberation reside within humanity, bending and rising to embrace the four seas, drifting yet weaving through all directions, where the supreme spirit is nurtured. When the supreme spirit is nurtured, it becomes wondrous and boundless, beyond measure—thus it is said: *The hidden essence of humanity lies in thought and deliberation, where the supreme spirit is nurtured.*\n\nThe Three Powers occupy distinct positions, yet each has its hidden essence. Though Heaven possesses its hidden essence, the Dao gives rise to Heaven; though Earth possesses its hidden essence, the Dao gives rise to Earth; though humanity possesses its hidden essence, humanity abides within the Dao. Thus all are encompassed by the Dao—because the Dao cannot be sought through form or number.\n\nThe Three Powers have not yet departed from form and number, yet the Dao cannot be sought through form and number. It may be called difficult to exhaust and difficult to fathom, yet it has never been confined; difficult to measure and difficult to recognize, yet its mysteries cannot be glimpsed.\n\nThe virtuous lend and yet fulfill—its transformation is subtle and profound. The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to Heaven and Earth; the Great Dao is nameless, nourishing all things—thus it is the hidden essence of all things.\n\nIf the Dao is the hidden essence of all things, then from the nonexistent arises the existent, and all things, though manifest, cannot evade it—are they not the manifest expression of the Dao?\n\n**The Treasure of the Virtuous Person**\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation:\nTo practice virtue is to accumulate goodness until nature is perfected, and the divine clarity is naturally attained. The Sage follows this path.\n\n*The Commentary* states:\nThere are those who treasure material things—jewels and jade, as spoken of in the *Transmissions*.\nThere are those who treasure the Dao—such as this statement on the treasure of the virtuous person.\n\nThe virtuous person does not treasure material things; their treasure lies in the Dao. Thus, from humanity they ascend to Heaven, from virtue they reach sainthood, and without entering they attain self-possession.\n\nFor the Dao is the interplay of *yin* and *yang*. What follows it is virtue; what fulfills it is nature. The virtuous person knows that virtue arises from the Dao and is perfected in nature, and thus their unadorned simplicity can be practiced and realized.\n\nWhen practiced, it becomes boundless in its goodness, and in its realization, it never falters. Able to exhaust their nature, they can assist in the transformation and nourishment of all things, aligning with the divine.\n\nFrom the accumulation of desired goodness to the fulfillment of perfect beauty—this is the accumulation of virtue into nature.\nFrom the radiance of great progress to the attainment of the ineffable divine—this is the divine clarity naturally attained.\n\nIf the Sage’s heart follows this path, then they do not stray from the Dao.\n\nWhat treasure can surpass this?\n\n**What the Non-Virtuous Preserve**\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation:\nTo act contrary to the Dao is to invite harm; to follow its principles is to remain whole. To act without restraint is to invite perversity; to still one’s nature is to remain upright—thus one can preserve the body.\n\n*The Commentary* states:\nThe Dao acts without action yet accomplishes all things.\nIf one acts contrary to its all-encompassing nature, there will be no harm.\nIf one acts without restraint, there will be no perversity.\n\nTo act contrary to the Dao without harm—one must abandon cleverness and artifice, follow its principles without deviation, and thus guard their wholeness, so that nothing can harm them. This is called *sincerity made whole and returned to its origin.*\n\nTo act without restraint yet remain upright—one must preserve their true nature in emptiness, still their essence without disturbance, and thus attain their uprightness, so that perversity cannot enter. This is called *the four extremes undisturbed, the heart then upright.*\n\nTo follow its principles and remain whole, to still one’s nature and remain upright—no matter what the world offers, it cannot exchange their守. Thus they can preserve their body without fear of ruin, and this is as it should be.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *To exhaust principle, to exhaust nature, and thus to attain fate.*\nTo follow its principles is to exhaust principle;\nTo exhaust one’s nature is to exhaust nature;\nTo preserve the body is to attain fate.\n\nWhat the non-virtuous preserve is no different from this.\n\nFine words can be sold in the market,\nNoble deeds can be bestowed upon others.\nWhat is there to abandon in humanity’s failings?\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation:\nWords are like waves—deeds are like the loss of substance.\nNeither is what the Dao values.\n\nWhen words are beautiful and pleasing, when deeds are noble and worthy of emulation, they can still be sold in the market, or bestowed upon others, and people will submit to them. How much more so when one embodies the Dao’s hidden essence, encompassing all without distinction?\n\nThus, what is there to abandon in humanity’s failings?\n\n*The Commentary* states:\nThe heart, when dwelling in emptiness and stillness, is virtuous. When it manifests in speech, it becomes the waves of wind—when it ceases, it becomes substance, and when it appears in action, it becomes the loss of substance.\n\nWords are like waves—deeds are like the loss of substance.\nBoth are lost in superficiality and are not what the Dao values.\n\nYet when speech is harmonious and the people are content, then beautiful words that please are still sufficient to—\n\n「Reverence, caution, awe, and propriety—these are the norms for the people. When actions are noble and worthy of emulation, they are still sufficient to bestow upon others, and how much more so when one embodies the Dao’s hidden essence?\n\nOnly when one embodies the Dao’s hidden essence does one nurture and manifest the myriad transformations, encompass all wonders, move like the heavens in their operation—covering all without partiality—and hold like the sea in its capacity—containing all without omission. Though they may appear diverse and conflicting, all converge in the singular principle of the Dao. What then is there to distinguish?\n\nThus, what is there to abandon in humanity’s imperfections?\n\n*The Classic of Poetry* says:\n*\"Is this not my great sage?*\n*What is there in others that he does not embrace?\"*\n\nTherefore, only those who embody the Dao’s hidden essence can truly fulfill the universal principle of inclusivity. Hence, establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Exalted Ministers—though they may offer jade discs and four-horse chariots to attract the worthy—is not as effective as simply cultivating this Dao to refine oneself. The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"The virtue of a gentleman lies in cultivating his own person to achieve peace in the realm. The Son of Heaven and the Three Exalted Ministers, though they use jade discs and four-horse chariots to summon the worthy and gain their service, fail to prioritize the cultivation of the Dao within themselves. Thus, they forsake themselves for others and lose the path of self-governance. ‘Not as effective as cultivating this Dao’ means seeking virtue within oneself alone. Where the Dao resides, the Sage holds it in reverence, and thus the people follow it as they return to the marketplace.\"*\n\n*The Commentary* states:\n*\"Though the world is vast, governance lies in the Dao; though the four seas are distant, governance lies in the heart. What is the greatest of guardianship? Guardianship of one’s person is greatest. When that which is guarded is most refined, then its application becomes most expansive. The ancients who spoke of governance began with self-discipline, their thoughts reaching far even in proximity. This is achieved through the cultivation of one’s own person. As for governing the realm, it is because the gentleman’s self-cultivation brings peace to the world. Though the Son of Heaven and the Three Exalted Ministers are esteemed for their rank, if they govern the people through the Dao, the realm will naturally submit. Even if they use jade discs and four-horse chariots to attract the worthy and gain their service, making them a glory for the state, yet they do not prioritize the cultivation of the Dao within themselves, they cannot maintain true guardianship. Without true guardianship, they abandon themselves for others and lose the path of self-governance.*\n\n*Yangzi said: ‘First govern oneself, then govern others—that is the mark of a great vessel.’*\n*‘Not as effective as cultivating this Dao’ means prioritizing self-governance.*\n\n*What is called self-governance is not external influence; it is seeking within oneself alone. If one seeks within oneself alone, then the use of others is but an extension of oneself. In ancient times, Emperor Yao achieved clarity and virtue, bringing the common folk to harmony in times of change. King Wen of Zhou was born with sagely wisdom, ascending to the shore of governance and ruling his state with ease. Each attained this through the same means.*\n\n*Though the Dao’s true essence lies in self-cultivation, its subtle extensions govern the state, and its fundamental principles govern the world—yet the key is to understand the Dao. Hence, where the Dao resides, the Sage holds it in reverence, and thus the people follow it as they return to the marketplace. The Sage is the parent of the people. When the Sage holds the Dao in reverence above, the people follow it below. If they grasp the Dao with the tenacity of a dog or the steadfastness of an elephant, will not the world turn toward them? Why was this Dao so esteemed in antiquity? Was it not because one seeks and attains it, and even the guilty are absolved? Hence, it is most precious for the world.*\n\n*The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:*\n*‘To seek is to attain—this seeking is within oneself.’*\n*Ancient people sought the Dao in the principles of yin and yang and the rhythms of fate, yet did not attain it. This was because they sought externally. Can the malevolent be transformed into the virtuous, and the foolish into the wise? This is how the guilty are absolved. The Dao’s benevolent teachings are such, hence its preciousness for the world.*\n\n*The Classic of Changes says:*\n*‘There is nothing in the world that is not esteemed—except the Dao.’*\n*The Commentary states:*\n*‘The heart is the sovereign of the Dao, so the Dao is never separate from me. The Dao cannot be sought through emotions, so it is never obstructed by external things. Since the Dao is never separate from me, one must seek it within oneself to attain true attainment—because seeking lies within me. Since the Dao is never obstructed by external things, one must seek it through the principles of yin and yang and the rhythms of fate. Seeking it for five years without attaining it, seeking it through yin and yang for twelve years without attaining it—this is because seeking lies externally. Seeking within oneself is beneficial for attainment; seeking externally is not. Thus, those who seek but do not attain do so because the Dao is near, yet they seek it far. But the virtuous seek and attain it by seeking within themselves alone. The Dao within oneself contains all beauties; people only suffer from not seeking it. If one truly aligns the heart with the Dao, then the malevolent can be transformed into the virtuous, virtue cultivated unconsciously, and there will be no fault of misconduct. The foolish can become wise, understanding the principles and awakening to them, without the confusion of divergent paths. This is how the guilty are absolved. The Dao’s benevolent salvation of humanity is such, hence it cannot be cheapened—it is most precious for the world. ‘There is nothing in the world that is not esteemed—except the Dao’ means it is not esteemed by external titles, yet its natural reverence is ever-present.*\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three: On Non-Action**\n*To practice non-action (wuwei), to act without clinging to action (shi-wu-shi), to savor without attachment to flavor (wei-wu-wei).*\n\n*The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:*\n*The Dao’s essence is without fabrication, hence non-action (wuwei); without form, hence without clinging to action (shi-wu-shi); without desire, hence without attachment to flavor (wei-wu-wei). The Sage responds to things as they are, yet embodies the Dao’s essence of non-fabrication in these three aspects.*\n\n*The Commentary states:*\n*The Dao’s subtlety lies in its non-existence; it cannot be sought through physical form. Yet when speaking of its grand completeness, we provisionally call it ‘essence.’ What is called the Dao’s essence is like Zhuangzi’s description of the ancient people’s great framework. Since the Dao’s essence is subtly non-existent, its stillness and motionlessness are non-fabrication (wuzuo). Non-fabrication means non-action (wuwei), and non-action means the utmost action is without fabrication. The formless form is without clinging to form (wuxiang). Without clinging to form means without clinging to action (shi-wu-shi), and without clinging to action means no burden of fabrication or action. The tranquil sufficiency is without desire (wuyu). Without desire means without attachment to flavor (wei-wu-wei), and without attachment to flavor means those who crave flavor have never truly presented themselves.\"*\n\n「Engaging in affairs and undertaking deeds—though they are accomplished, they are said to be \"action,\" yet their origin lies in *wuwei* [non-action].\nThe ears, eyes, nose, and mouth each have their functions—though they manifest form, their operations arise from *wushì* [non-affairs].\nThe taste of the river is universally desired—though it is called \"desire,\" its essence comes from *wuwèi* [non-flavor].\nThus, one sees how the marvelous application of the Dao unfolds.\n\nThe Sage embodies the true *wu* [non-being] while perpetually manifesting *you* [being], and manifests the marvelous *yòng* [function] while perpetually returning to *wu* [non-being].\nTherefore, in responding to the *you* of things, it is as if the *wu* naturally transforms into *you*.\nIn embodying the *wu* of the Dao, it reaches the utmost *wu* to fulfill its *you*.\nThrough these three aspects, the Dao’s essence and function are indeed manifest.\n\n**Great and small, much and little:**\nHuizong’s annotation: \"Great and small\" refers to form, \"much and little\" to quantity. The measure of things is boundless, beyond enumeration.\nIf something is great yet not excessive, small yet not deficient, then the distinctions between resentment and gratitude—who can discern them?\n\nThe Sage unifies all things in the One *wu*, thus achieving the utmost greatness.\nThe *Cushui* explains:\nFrom the perspective of things, they appear in diverse forms—whether the void or the great marsh, the minutest hair or a horse’s body—differing in shape and confined by form, varying in number and constrained by quantity.\nFrom the perspective of the Dao, all things are one. Though the Northern Sea is vast, it is unknown whether it is \"great yet not excessive\"; though the Jīng River’s flow is small, it is unknown whether it is \"small yet not deficient.\" Since the measure of things is boundless, it cannot be enumerated.\nThus, resentment may have its distinctions, but gratitude arises from the heart. Though these two may be instruments of rectification, they are not the Dao of rectification itself.\nActing without expectation of return, the Sage harmonizes with all things—how then can distinctions be seen?\n\nThe Sage, through the emptiness of the Dao, receives all the manifold realities of the world, never causing harm to others, never hoarding benevolence and grace. Thus, unifying all things in the One *wu*, gathering all smallness into unity, achieving the utmost greatness—spanning heaven and earth, vast beyond containment.\nTherefore, the Emperor and King take heaven and earth as their ancestral model, and this is the pinnacle of the central realm.\n\n**Repaying resentment with virtue:**\nHuizong’s annotation: Titles and rewards are insufficient as incentives, punishments and shame are insufficient as deterrents—then what resentment remains? What is valued is virtue alone.\nThe *Cushui* explains:\nOne who embodies complete virtue gains the world’s praise yet remains indifferent, unaffected by the rewards of crowns and honors—thus, titles and rewards are insufficient as incentives.\nOne who embodies complete virtue faces the world’s censure yet remains unshaken, fearing neither the executioner’s axe nor the blade—thus, punishments and shame are insufficient as deterrents.\nWhen honor and disgrace arise, they neither benefit nor harm their true nature. Thus, distinctions of right and wrong cannot be divided, and distinctions of greatness and smallness cannot be enumerated. At the utmost division, there is ultimately no division—then what resentment remains?\nOnly one of supreme virtue can achieve this. Thus, what is truly valued is virtue alone.\n\nFor the Yang is virtue, the Yin is resentment. Repaying resentment with virtue means merging into the indistinct, flowing without obstruction—this is called \"responding to resentment without resentment,\" and it is the highest expression of virtue.\n\n**Addressing difficulties in their ease, achieving greatness in the minute:**\nThe world’s difficult matters must begin in ease, the world’s great affairs must begin in the minute.\nHuizong’s annotation:\nA thousand-zhang dike collapses from the burrow of an ant;\nA hundred-foot hall burns from a crack’s smoke.\nWhite Gui’s dike-walking seals the burrows, thus avoiding water’s calamity.\nThe aged man’s fire-watching seals the gaps, thus avoiding fire’s disaster.\nWorldly affairs always originate in the most trivial matters, and by the time they reach their end, they become impossible to counter—thus, the Sage acts early.\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*The Classic* says, \"Do not let it spread,\" for once it spreads, it is difficult to counter—thus, those who plan far ahead do not neglect what is easy.\n*The Scripture* says, \"Do it before it exists,\" for those who know the few must examine what is minute.\nA thousand-zhang dike may be called a river’s defense, yet if the ant’s burrow—though small—is not stopped, the trickle will not be dammed, and it will become a river.\nA hundred-foot hall may be called a secure dwelling, yet if the crack’s smoke—though faint—is not heeded, the flicker will not be extinguished, and the flames will rage—what then?\nWhite Gui’s dike-walking must seal the burrows, thus avoiding water’s calamity.\nThe aged man’s fire-watching must seal the gaps, thus avoiding fire’s disaster.\nYet the enlightened sage acts brilliantly in the fleeting and subtle, applying wisdom before matters become overwhelming. Each time this is observed, it echoes Han Fei’s teachings.\n\nThus, it is seen: the world’s affairs always originate in the most trivial matters.\n*The Odes* say, \"On auspicious days, be cautious of the minute,\" because affairs arise from the most trivial matters.\nBy the time they reach their end, they become impossible to counter.\n*The Changes* say, \"In anticipating calamities, take preventive measures,\" because their end is difficult to counter.\nThe Sage’s wisdom penetrates to the divine, and thus acts early—knowing this alone. This aligns with the Master’s saying, \"Planning ahead in advance is called foresight.\"\n\nThus, the Sage never seeks the great directly, and so achieves the utmost greatness.\nHuizong’s annotation: \"Acting in the small, thus achieving the great.\"\nThe *Cushui* explains:\nWhen the earth is but a clod, it becomes a field;\nWhen water is but a ladleful, it becomes a river.\nThus, acting in the small allows one to achieve the great—this is the natural order.\nThe Sage deliberates in undertaking affairs, ensuring each success, thus bringing about great governance—also by acting in the small.\n\n*The Odes* praise the governance of Wen and Wu, accumulating the *Xiao Ya* to form the *Da Ya*—its beginning was small, its accomplishment great, thus achieving internal and external governance, beginning with diligent concern.\n\nThus, if one waits until chaos has already taken form before seeking to govern it, is this not too late?\n\nMencius cited *The Odes: Owl* (《鸱鸮》) to say:\n*\"Before the heavens darken with rain, mend the thatched doors and windows of the mulberry grove.*\n*This is to make known the state’s policies and laws when there is still leisure—*\n*seeking to govern before the crisis arises.*\n*How could it compare to waiting for the great cold before seeking warm garments?\"*\n\nThus, the Sage takes this poem as the *Dao/Way* of foresight.\n\nTherefore, the affairs of the world—what seems small can be done, and what seems great cannot be undone once neglected.\n\nHe who makes light of promises will lack trustworthiness; he who undertakes many things lightly will face many difficulties. Hence, the Sage proceeds with caution, and thus ultimately faces no difficulties.\n\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*\"Calamity is often hidden in the subtle, erupting when people overlook it.*\n*The Sage’s response to the world is always to be vigilant in the subtle and never negligent,*\n*so there is never any reckless action,*\n*and thus no insurmountable calamity arises.*\n*This is all in accordance with the principle of *wu* (無)—non-doing, non-action.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*\"Fire arises from wood; if the disaster is inevitable, then calamity is indeed hidden in the subtle.*\n*If one treats it lightly, it is unwise, and thus calamity erupts when people overlook it.*\n*Mencius said that blessings and misfortunes are all self-sought—*\n*this is to say, do not neglect the subtle.*\n\n*The Sage’s response to the world is to share in the people’s afflictions.*\n*His wisdom suffices to comprehend the principles of things,*\n*his foresight suffices to perceive omens early,*\n*and he deliberates before signs appear,*\n*always cautious in the subtle, considering beginnings with the same care as endings,*\n*and never overlooking what others neglect.*\n*Thus, there is never any reckless action,*\n*and thus no insurmountable calamity arises.*\n\n*The Records* say:\n*'Better to have one’s own grudges than to break a promise without cause.'*\n*Without reckless promises, words will align with actions.*\n\n*The Commentaries* say:\n*'If one deems it easy, difficulty will soon follow.'*\n*Without undertaking many things lightly, every action will lead to auspicious outcomes.*\n\n*Thus, navigating the world with this approach—*\n*adapting flexibly and appropriately—*\n*one will ultimately face no difficulties.*\n\n*Yet this is not because one delights in omniscience,*\n*but because one embodies the *wu* of *wuwei*—*\n*non-action, non-taste,*\n*the *Dao/Way* of nothingness.*\n\n*Where the *Dao/Way* resides, who can pose difficulty?*\n*The final stanza of *The Teal and Heron* speaks of no future calamity—*\n*this aligns with the same meaning.*\n\n*Chapter Sixty-Four of *The Ease of Holding Firm*:*\n*'What is firm is easy to hold,*\n*what is yet unmanifest is easy to plan,*\n*what is fragile is easy to dissolve,*\n*what is subtle is easy to disperse.*\n*Act before it exists,*\n*govern before it is disordered.*\n\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*'Firmness is the opposite of danger,*\n*the unmanifest is the opposite of what is already formed,*\n*the fragile is the opposite of hardness,*\n*the subtle is the opposite of what is manifest.*\n*To hold firmness is to avoid danger,*\n*to plan before the unmanifest is to prevent its formation.*\n\n*The Sage’s foresight—*\n*to dissolve fragility before it hardens,*\n*to disperse the subtle before it takes hold—*\n*this is the near-miss of the worthy.*\n\n*Chariots racing on steep paths,*\n*boats navigating treacherous currents—*\n*the Sage has no need for such cleverness.*\n*Cleverness is applied before the race or the sinking,*\n*this is what is meant by*\n*'acting before it exists,*\n*governing before it is disordered.'*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*'Matters hidden in non-existence all follow natural principles;*\n*once they manifest, they all follow inevitable mechanisms.*\n*The principles are deeply hidden—*\n*only the most divine can penetrate them;*\n*the mechanisms are subtly triggered—*\n*only the most wise can foresee them.*\n\n*'Firmness is the opposite of danger—*\n*where there is firmness, there must be danger.*\n*The unmanifest is the opposite of what is formed—*\n*if unmanifest, its form will vanish,*\n*this is the principle of non-existence.*\n*The fragile is the opposite of hardness—*\n*hardness has already taken its substance.*\n*The subtle is the opposite of what is manifest—*\n*manifestation has already revealed its beginning,*\n*this is the reality of existence.*\n\n*'To hold firmness is to avoid danger,*\n*thus one can preserve the state.*\n*To plan before the unmanifest is to prevent calamity.*\n\n*The Sage’s foresight—*\n*is it not divine?*\n*Knowing the subtle and the manifest,*\n*acting clearly in the fleeting and obscure,*\n*divine insight into the future.*\n\n*To dissolve fragility before it hardens—*\n*this is why one must be cautious at the first frost.*\n*To disperse the subtle before it takes hold—*\n*this is why one must examine the minutest details.*\n\n*The worthy’s near-miss—*\n*their wisdom, though not divine,*\n*is close to perfection when reflecting,*\n*and does not stray when erring,*\n*discerning early what the wise later grasp.*\n\n*Indeed, omens are the subtle movements,*\n*the precursors of auspiciousness.*\n*Seeing the second line of *Yù* (《豫》):*\n*'In accordance with principle, one awakens—*\n*this is the Sage’s foresight.'*\n\n*The first line of *Fù* (《复》):*\n*'Form takes shape, then one awakens—*\n*this is the worthy’s near-miss.'*\n\n*Only because they know omens*\n*do they not ultimately say, 'This is auspicious.'*\n*Only because they nearly miss*\n*do they have no regret,*\n*and thus how could there be calamities of racing chariots or sinking boats?*\n\n*Indeed, chariots are for ascending steep paths,*\n*boats are for crossing difficulties—*\n*racing chariots, sinking boats,*\n*the Sage has no need for such cleverness.*\n\n*Yang Xiong, in response to a question,*\n*spoke of applying cleverness before the race or sinking.*\n\n*Thus, to act before it exists,*\n*to govern before it is disordered—*\n*this brings ultimate safety,*\n*surpassing even the most perilous paths or the need for oars.*\n\n*A tree of embrace grows from the minutest sprout;*\n*a nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;*\n*a thousand-*li journey begins beneath one’s feet.*\n\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*'All formed things—*\n*the great must grow from the small,*\n*the high must be founded on the low,*\n*the distant must begin near.*\n*What is simple in its beginning*\n*will inevitably become vast in its completion.*\n\n*The Sage, seeing the beginning, contemplates the end,*\n*observing the finger, knows the path.*\n*Thus, he does not become the first to invite blessings,*\n*nor the first to invite calamity.*\n*He deliberates before undertaking affairs,*\n*ensuring each success.'*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*'What is formed arises from what is formless;*\n*all that is constrained by form*\n*must progress from the subtle to the manifest—*\n*thus, the great must grow from the small.*\n\n*To seek the axe’s handle,*\n*one must begin with the uncut millimeter;*\n*that a tree of embrace grows from the minutest sprout is evident.\"*\n\nIf ascending must begin from below,\nthen the high must indeed be founded on the low.\nLofty mountains rise from the unceasing accumulation of soil—\na nine-tiered terrace begins with the same.\nFrom near to far, then the distant must begin near.\nTo reach a thousand *li*, one accumulates at every step without pause—\na thousand-*li* journey begins beneath one’s feet.\n\nThese three truths:\nTheir beginnings are simple,\ntheir origins small,\nyet their completion is vast,\ntheir end great—\nsuch is their nature.\n\nAll things have a root and branch,\nall affairs have an end and a beginning.\nThe Sage, seeing the beginning, contemplates the end,\nthus seeking its ultimate fulfillment;\nobserving the finger, he knows its path,\nthus grasping its destined course.\n\nContemplating near and far,\nin silence aligning with the Way,\nhe does not become the first to invite blessings—\nfor blessings do not then come—\nnor the first to invite calamity—\nfor calamities do not then arrive.\nHe acts in accordance with the time,\nmoves in harmony with the Way,\ndeliberates before undertaking affairs,\nand ensures each success—\nresponding only to what is felt.\n\nWhen the affairs of the world press upon him,\nand he might decline them without action,\neven the most trivial matters contain what must be done—\nyet to do them when they are easy?\nHe must first deliberate before acting,\nlest he act only when it is no longer easy.\n\nOnly by not acting when it is easy\ndo the affairs he undertakes\ninevitably achieve completion—\ntruly, his successes are grand!\n\nTo act is to court failure;\nto grasp is to court loss.\nThus the Sage does nothing,\nand so knows no failure;\nhe does not grasp,\nand so knows no loss.\n\n*The Cushui* explains:\nThe Sage does not engage in affairs,\nand so knows no failure.\nHe does not cling to fixed ways,\nand so knows no loss.\nThe ignorant, however, set measures and cling to them,\never drifting farther from the Way—\nhow could they avoid failure and loss?\n\nThe principles of the world\nmay be followed, not forced;\ntrusted, not seized.\nTo act seeking completion\nis to ensure failure;\nto grasp seeking possession\nis to ensure loss.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Way’s emptiness,\nremaining still and doing nothing—\nnot engaging in affairs,\nthus bearing no responsibility for action,\nand so knows no failure.\nHe adapts without clinging,\nnot holding fast to old ways—\nthus bearing no burden of past actions,\nand so knows no loss.\n\nYet the ignorant do not know\nthat time never stops,\nthat circumstances never remain fixed—\nthey set measures and cling to them,\nblinded by one perspective,\nunaware of the whole.\nHow different is this from carving a boat to seek a sword,\nor gluing a pillar to tune a zither?\nNo wonder they drift ever farther from the Way,\nunable to embrace change—\nhow few escape failure and loss!\n\nThus the common folk,\nwhen nearly complete in their endeavors,\noften fail.\n*The Cushui* explains:\nTo halt midway is to never reach the peak;\nto abandon halfway is to never find the path.\nThough they begin with diligence,\nthey end in slackness—\nthis is the nature of the common heart,\nand so their affairs often fail just as they near completion.\n\n*The Commentary* says:\n*\"He who can reach the hill with his feet*\n*must follow the path to its end—*\n*to halt midway is to reach nothing.*\n*Though the road be winding, it leads to all under Heaven—*\n*to abandon it halfway is to find no destination.\"*\n\nConfucius spoke of *\"what I do not do for myself,\"*\nmeaning this very truth—\nnot only for learning,\nbut for all undertakings.\nIf their resolve falters in what they guard,\nif their strength wears in what they pursue,\nbeginning with diligence but ending in slackness,\nhow could their affairs succeed?\n\nAt first, they take joy in fleeting moments,\nyet soon grow weary of endurance—\nthe common heart is easily swayed by things.\nTo begin with vigor and end in neglect\nis the way of all the common folk.\nOnly by stopping not to advance,\nabandoning halfway to draw their own limits,\ndo their affairs often fail just as they near completion.\n\nMencius sighed for those who act,\ncomparing them to one who digs a well nine *ren* deep\nyet never reaches the spring.\nTo treat the end as carefully as the beginning\nis to know no failure in affairs.\n\n*The Cushui* explains:\n*\"None begin without end,*\n*few complete what they start.*\n*To make the end like the beginning,*\n*time itself renews—*\n*what affair, thus treated, would not succeed?\"*\n\n*The Commentary* says:\nKing Cheng admonished his ministers,\nsaying, *\"Let your ambition be as vast as your resolve,*\n*your deeds as broad as your actions.\"*\nThis means:\nWithin, exhaust your heart—this is resolve;\nwithout, exhaust your strength—this is diligence.\n*\"None begin without end,*\n*few complete what they start,\"*\nfor when the heart grows slack\nand strength grows weary,\nhow could one not tire before completion?\n\nYi Yin said:\n*\"To make the end like the beginning,*\n*time itself renews—*\n*thus, with unceasing sincerity,*\n*one attends to its ultimate fulfillment.*\n*To let time renew itself,*\n*one acts without weariness,*\n*even in rest, never resting.\"*\n\nApplying this to affairs,\nthey must be brought to order before ceasing—\nwhat undertaking, thus treated, would not succeed?\nThis is what is meant by:\n*\"To treat the end as carefully as the beginning*\n*is to know no failure in affairs.\"*\n\n*The Classic* says:\n*\"Only the Sage has both beginning and end.\"*\nThus the Sage desires not to desire,\nvalues not the hard-to-obtain treasures;\nlearns not to learn,\nrestoring what others have overstepped.\n\n*The Cushui* explains:\nThose who desire profit\nexchange themselves for things,\ndrowning in worldly pursuits.\nThose who pursue learning\ndrown in endless knowledge,\nlosing its true path.\nHow could this lead to *wuwei*?\n\nThe Sage does not burden himself with profit,\ndesiring only not to desire—\nnurturing self and others equally,\nstopping only when fully nourished,\nthus not valuing hard-to-obtain treasures,\nnot letting others extinguish the Way.\n\nLearning lies in not learning,\nmerely weaving and brightening the light—\nthus restoring what others have overstepped.\nWhen the Way is obscured,\neven the worthy err—\nhow much more the common folk?\nTo restore their errors and return to nature\nis how the absolute learner knows no worry,\nonly joy.\n\n*The Commentary* says:\nZhuangzi spoke of those who indulge in wealth and honor,\nexchanging themselves for things,\nthus lost in worldly song.\nLiezi warned that scholars perish through endless pursuits,\ndrowning in knowledge without foundation.\n\n「Is it not sufficient to attain *wuwei*?\n\nThe so-called *wuwei* holds nothing dearer than *xu* [emptiness], nothing more skillful than *jing* [stillness], and nothing else.\n\nTo exchange oneself for things is to lose oneself in them—\nalready galloping with the restless, one does not know\nthat stillness lies in motion itself.\n\nTo drown oneself in knowledge is to make the heart\nbranched and doubtful—\nalready obstructed by the concrete, one does not know\nthat diminishing the concrete brings *xu* [emptiness].\n\nThus, it is not sufficient to attain *wuwei*.\n\nThe Sage does not act so.\n\nHe does not burden his form with profit,\nfor his seeking lies within—\nwhat he desires is internal, not external,\nand desire arises from *not* desiring.\n\nTo share profit brings delight,\nto share sustenance brings ease—\nnot clinging to the gains of one age as private possession,\nbut ensuring all under heaven are nourished,\nwhich aligns with Zhuangzi’s words:\n*\"nurturing self and others equally,\nstopping only when fully nourished.\"*\n\nThus, he does not value hard-to-obtain treasures,\nnor let others extinguish the Way—\nhe simply abandons human contrivance.\n\nWhat he learns lies in the heart,\nnot in external pursuit,\nand learning is in *not* learning.\n\nFollowing nature’s inherent course,\npracticing until mastery,\nhe does not augment true virtue with fragmented schemes,\nbut aims for morning clarity to behold the singular—\nthis is what the *Shijing* [Book of Songs] calls\n*\"learning lies in weaving and brightening the light\"*—\nthus restoring what others have overstepped.\n\nFor those who exhaust skill and seek rare treasures,\nthese are the hard-to-obtain things.\nThe Sage does not value them,\nfor he wishes the people not to stray after things—\nthus can it be said:\n*\"I have no desires, yet the people find sufficiency.\"*\n\nTo abandon the root and chase the superficial\nis the error of the common folk.\nThe Sage restores their errors,\nnot to punish them but to return them to the Way—\nthus can it be said:\n*\"He is always good at saving people,\nyet never abandons them.\"*\n\nFor the Way, when obscured,\neven the worthy err—\nthe wise among the worthy still have their *guo* [oversteps],\nhow much more the common folk?\n\nTo restore their errors and return them to nature\nis how the heart is cultivated and virtue is restored,\nvirtue reaches perfection and aligns with its original state,\napproaching the vision of the Dao and transcending learning—\nabiding in nature’s inherent course,\nwithout fixed purpose yet ever joyful,\nthis is how the absolute learner knows no worry.\n\nIf the son of Yan [Preyan] discards *renyi* [benevolence and righteousness], *gongyue* [rites and music],\nyet finds joy in his *danpiao* [coarse meal and gourd], *zhuoru* [wild plants and coarse rice],\nis this not akin to the Sage’s joy in forgetting worries?\n\nTo aid the natural unfolding of all things,\nyet not dare to act.\n\n*The Commentary* of Xuanzong [Huang] says:\n*\"Heaven is high, earth is low,\nall things are dispersed and distinct—\nhow could one force them?\nTheir growth and change are nature’s own.\nTo aid their natural unfolding,\nis how their nature is perfected.\nTo act is to ruin them—\nthus the Sage does not dare to act.\nThis is how the Sage relies on Dao/Way’s transformation,\nnot on clever schemes.\"*\n\n*The Commentary* says:\n*\"Heaven moves above,\nnot creating yet transforming,\nearth rests below,\nnot growing yet nurturing—\nall things flourish between heaven and earth,\nlike motion or stillness,\nsprouting in varied forms—\nthis is what is meant by\n*‘Heaven is high, earth is low,\nall things are dispersed and distinct.’*\n\nThe Sage praises heaven and earth’s transformation and nurturing,\nand all things that follow their Way—\nhow could one force them?\nTheir birth, growth, and change in form and color,\ntheir intelligence and capabilities waxing or waning—\nthese are nature’s own.\nTo aid their natural unfolding,\nis not to promote their growth,\nnor to urge their completion,\nbut to let them be as they are,\nentrusting them to their own course—\nthus their nature is perfected.\n\nYet heaven acts without action and remains clear,\nearth acts without action and remains tranquil,\nall things follow their roles—\neach thrives from *wuwei* [non-action],\nso what aids their nature\nis not by human force or cleverness?\n\nTo act is to ruin them,\nand even worse, to invite the loss of *zhong* [augmentation].\nThus the Sage does not dare to act.\nThis is how the Sage relies on Dao/Way’s transformation,\nnot on clever schemes.\n\nRelying on Dao/Way’s transformation,\nhe follows things’ natural course without private favor—\nnot clinging to cleverness,\nhe discards knowledge and habit,\nconforming to heaven’s principles—\nthus, without action, all things transform.\n\nAs for those who carve *zhu* [bamboo or wood],\nthree years to make one leaf—\nthen few are the things with leaves,\nhow can they speak of Dao/Way’s transformation?\n\n**Chapter 65: Ancient Masters of the Dao**\nThe ancient masters who excelled in the Dao\ndid not seek to enlighten the people—\nthey sought only to bewilder them.\n\n*The Commentary* of Xuanzong [Huang] says:\n*\"The people can be led by the Way,\nbut cannot be made to know it—\nthe ancient masters of the Dao\nled them by the Way alone.\nTo reverse their natural state,\nthe Way can be carried and followed together—\nno need for clever

*wuwei*’s affairs,\nthose who delight in *hentian* [artificial harmony]\ndo not know how to practice *unspoken teaching* [不言之教],\nyet they claim to enlighten the people,\ncalling it *governance* [治],\nbut which chaos is greater than this?\"*\n\n*The Commentary* says:\n*\"The Sage’s Way is present in the world,\nits benevolence is evident in its adaptability and completion—\nthus the people can be led by it.\nIts skill and depth are hidden in its application—\nthus it cannot be made known.\nThe *Yijing* [Book of Changes] says:\n*‘The common folk say “it works,” yet do not know why.’*\nMencius says:\n*‘Many follow it all their lives,\nyet do not know its Way.’*\n\nThe ancient masters of the Dao\neach attained this principle,\nyet they said:\n*‘I bewilder the people’s

world’s form yet harm it—\nthis is to await the plumb line and compass before achieving rectitude.\n\nAh, extolling benevolence and righteousness,\nto soothe the world’s heart yet err in pedantry—\nthis is to rely on cords and glue before achieving firmness.\n\nIf such is the case, then the natural course is lost.\nTo claim enlightenment of the people,\ncalling it governance—\nwhat greater chaos is there than this?\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"I have heard of nurturing the world,\nbut never of governing it.\"*\n\nFor to enlighten and govern the people\nis not the way to govern the world.\nOnly by nurturing them does one see\nthe people daily incline toward the realm of peace and ease,\nliving in settled stillness—\nwhy then speak of governing the world?\nWith such a heart of nurturing,\nhow could one say there is governance of the world?\n\nThe difficulty in governing lies in their excess of cleverness.\nEmperor Xuanzong annotated:\n*\"When the world is often in great disorder,\nthe fault lies in their love of knowledge.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains:\n*\"If one’s knowledge of bows, crossbows, and arrows is excessive,\nthen winged and soaring creatures cannot ascend high.\nIf one’s knowledge of nets and traps is excessive,\nthen scaled and swimming creatures cannot dive deep.\nIf one’s knowledge of axes, saws, and tools is excessive,\nthen those who walk with calloused feet cannot tread in the abyss.\nIf this is true of things, how much more so for people?\nThus, the more one knows of deceitful schemes,\nthe more the common folk are bewildered by them.\"*\n\nZhuang Zhou, by examining the principles of things to verify human affairs, understands that all things arise from the **Dao/Way**, yet cannot be disturbed by cleverness. Thus, he says that when the world often falls into great disorder, the fault lies in their love of knowledge.\n\nThe **sage’s governance** always keeps the people without knowledge or desire, allowing the **Dao/Way’s** empty tranquility to emerge as the natural response for all under heaven—what need is there for cleverness to suffice?\n\nTherefore, those who speak well of governance say:\nIn discussing the foundation of **Great Peace (太平)**, they declare that **schemes and stratagems are not employed (智谋不用)**.\nIn speaking of the marvelous transformation of the **Dao/Way (道化)**, they say that it does not rely on **cleverness and skill (不恃智巧)**.\nIs this not to say that the essentials of governance lie in **knowing the Dao/Way (知道)** rather than in loving cleverness?\n\nHence, **governing with cleverness** is the ruin of the state.\nEmperor Xuanzong annotated:\n*\"When laws are promulgated, deceit flourishes; when decrees are issued, fraud arises.\"*\n\nThe **Cushui commentary** explains:\nZhuangzi says: **\"The wise are instruments of contention (争之器).\"**\nIf cleverness arises from contention, then the people will pursue profit and become **artful in schemes (机巧)**.\nWhat is meant by **\"laws are promulgated\"** is that without laws, there is nothing adequate to bind them.\nIf severe prohibitions are established by law, yet there are still those who **defy and transgress (抵冒)**, then the hearts of deceit and malice cannot be unified.\nWhat is meant by **\"decrees are issued\"** is that without decrees, there is nothing adequate to command them.\nWhen decrees are issued, only obedience follows—yet if there are still those who **pretend compliance (面革)**, then the emotions of deceit and falsehood cannot be stopped.\nThe **Classics** say: *\"The more laws and decrees are multiplied, the more thieves and robbers will appear.\"*\nThus, deceit and fraud are evident—**governing with cleverness** is the ruin of the state.\n**Not governing with cleverness** is the blessing of the state.\nEmperor Xuanzong annotated:\n*\"Burn the symbols and shatter the seals, and the people will be simple and unsophisticated.\nAbandon the measures and break the balances, and the people will not contend.\"*\n\nThe **Cushui commentary** explains:\nZhuangzi says: **\"The Dao/Way is the public standard (为之公).\"**\nIf the **Dao/Way** is made the public standard, then the people will naturally **trust without constraint (不约而自孚)**.\nWhat is meant by **\"burn the symbols and shatter the seals\"** is not that they are literally burned and broken—rather, by **establishing trust (信信)**, the people become simple and unsophisticated, and symbols and seals are no longer relied upon.\nWhat is meant by **\"abandon the measures and break the balances\"** is not that they are literally discarded and snapped—rather, by **acting with fairness (平平)**, the people do not contend, and measures and balances are of no use.\nThe **Classics** say: *\"If I love tranquility, the people will naturally be upright.\nIf I have no desires, the people will naturally be content.\"*\nWhen the people are upright and content, their simplicity and lack of contention are clear—**not governing with cleverness** is the blessing of the state.\nUnderstanding these two principles is the **model (楷式)**.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong annotated:\n*\"Understanding these two principles means knowing how to govern the state.\nKnowing how to govern the state, the people will follow and emulate them as the model.\"*\n\nThe **Cushui commentary** explains:\n*\"The form is correct, then its reflection is correct;\nThe source is clear, then the stream is clear—\nthis is the natural correspondence (自然之符).\"*\nThe **sage**, standing above the people and things of the world,\n**upright in form and clear in source (端表澄源)**,\ngoverns without action while the world transforms—\nit is only a matter of **employing cleverness or not employing cleverness (用智与不用智)****.\nUnderstanding these two principles means knowing that the responsibility of governance lies in **clarity and tranquility (清静)**, with no need for cleverness.\n\nIf one does not govern with cleverness,\nthen those who listen to the **sage’s voice (听唱)** and observe his **rites and conduct (视仪)**,\nwill derive their **model (效法)** from the **Dao/Way’s** manifestations and responses—\nwho would not follow and emulate them as the model?\n\n**Model (则)** is like the **standard for making a standard (作则之则)**—\nbecause it has a standard, the people follow the standard.\n**Emulation (象)** is like the **pendant for hanging a pendant (垂象之象)**—\nbecause it has an emulation, the people emulate it.\nOnly because there is a model and emulation,\nthe people follow and emulate them as the model.\n\nIf, for instance, Master Guanzhi posed the question:\n*\"Why does water round the basin, yet the basin itself is round?\nWhy does water square the vessel, yet the vessel itself is square?\"*\nHis intent aligns with this.\n\n**Constantly knowing the model (常智楷式)** is called **Mysterious Virtue (玄德)**.\n**Mysterious Virtue** is profound, vast, and contrary to things.\nEmperor Xuanzong annotated:\n*\"Mysterious (玄) is the color of Heaven.\nIf one constantly knows the model without using cleverness,\nthen one unites with Heaven’s virtue—\nprofound beyond measure,\nvast beyond limit,\nstanding alone above all things,\nwith nothing to pair with.\"*\nThus, it is said: **\"contrary to things (与物反).\"**\n\nThe **Cushui commentary** explains:\n*\"The subtle and minute is called Mysterious (玄).\nMysterious is the color of Heaven.\nIf one constantly knows the model without using cleverness,\nthen one takes **Embracing Unity (抱一)** as the model for all under Heaven.\nIf so, then abandoning cleverness and fixed habits,\nfollowing Heaven’s principles,\none should naturally unite with Heaven’s virtue—\nsilent and odorless,\nprofound beyond measure,\nboundless and undivided,\nvast beyond limit,\nstanding alone above all things,\nwith nothing to pair with—\nthis is what Master Liezi called **the Doubtful One (疑独)**,\nhence it is said: **‘contrary to things.’**\nUnless one **enters the Dao/Way (入)** and **discerns things (辨物)**,\nwho can unite with Heaven’s virtue?\nThen one reaches **Great Harmony (大顺).\"**\n\nEmperor Xuanzong annotated:\n*\"Harmony (顺) is Heaven’s principle.\nTo reach **Great Harmony** means\nabandoning cleverness and fixed habits,\nfollowing Heaven’s principle alone.\"*\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"To unite with Heaven and Earth,\nits union is **profound and vast (缗缗)**,\nas if **stupid and befuddled (若愚若昏)**—\nthis is called **Mysterious Virtue (玄德)**,\nin accord with **Great Harmony (大顺).\"**\nOnly by being **as if stupid and befuddled (若愚若昏)**,\ncan one abandon cleverness.\n\nThe **Cushui commentary** explains:\nIn the *Yijing*’s **\"Yù (豫)\"** it says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth move with Harmony (顺动),\nso the sun and moon do not pass their bounds,\nand the four seasons do not err.\"*\nThis is **Harmony as Heaven’s principle**—\nfrom its **nature (体)**, **Qián (乾)** is the most robust,\nyet from its **principle (理)**, **Qián (乾)** is easily known—\nhence it is said: *\"The simple principles of all under Heaven are easily attained (易简天下之理得),\"\nand this is why **Harmony** is Heaven’s principle.*\n\nTo reach **Great Harmony** means\nabandoning the cleverness that makes one **artificial (使然)**,\nand aligning with the **natural principles (自然之至理)**—\nby **not knowing and not recognizing (不识不知)**,\nfollowing the **sage’s model (帝之则)** alone.\nThis is what is meant by:\n*\"Abandoning cleverness and fixed habits,\nfollowing Heaven’s principle.\"*\n\nZhuang Zhou wrote in the *\"Heaven and Earth (天地)\"* chapter,\ndiscussing **nature (性)**, **cultivation (修)**, and **inverted virtue (反德)**—\nwhen **virtue (德)** reaches its peak,\nit is in accord with the **initial state (初有)**:\n*\"To unite with Heaven and Earth,\nits union is **profound and vast (缗缗)**,\nas if **stupid and befuddled (若愚若昏)**—\nthis is called **Mysterious Virtue (玄德)**,\nin accord with **Great Harmony (大顺).\"**\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\n**there is emptiness yet no

**profoundly silent (冥心)** and without knowledge,\nwhen **befuddled (若昏)**, the eyes are **stuck and unmoving (胶目)** and without sight—\nwithout knowledge and without sight,\nthis is called **Mysterious Virtue (玄德)**.\n\nWhen **virtue (德)** reaches **Mysterious Virtue (玄)**,\nthen **nature (性)** and Heaven accord naturally—\nwithout striving or meeting others,\nand thus in accord with **Great Harmony (大顺)**.\n\nOnly because they are **stupid and befuddled (若愚若昏)**,\ncan they **abandon discernment (去智)**;\nOnly because they **abandon discernment (去智)**,\ncan they **return to virtue (原於德)** and **fulfill the Heavenly (成於天)**.\n\nZhuangzi, in the opening of the *\"Heaven and Earth (天地)\"* chapter,\nspeaks only of **Heavenly Virtue (天德)**,\nand its meaning aligns with this.\n\n**Chapter 66: \"The King of All Valleys (江海为百谷王)\"**\nThe reason **Jiānghǎi (江海)** can be the **King of All Valleys (百谷王)** is that it **excels in descending (善下)**,\nthus able to be the **King of All Valleys (百谷王)**.\n\nThe **Huizong (徽宗)** annotation states:\n*\"When one undertakes deeds and establishes achievements,\nand compares them to the highest (一上比者),\nthat is the **King (王)**.\"*\n\nThe **King (王)** carries the meaning of **returning and drawing (归往)**—\nif a ruler **descends to those below (下下)**,\nthen the people **return to him (归之)**,\nas water flows downward.\n\nThe **Cushioned Explanation (疏义)** states:\n*\"The Sage speaks of **virtue (德)**,\nthe **King (王)** speaks of **achievements (业)**—\nthese are the deeds and achievements\nthat make one a **King (王)**.\nThe **King (王)** is the **Lord (公)**,\nand the **Lord (公)** is Heaven—\nthis is the comparison to the highest (一上比),\nso one becomes a **King (王)**.\nThe **King (王)** carries the meaning of **returning and drawing (归往)**—\nthis is the **King of the people (下民之王)**.\nThe reason the people **turn toward and attach themselves (向往而亲附)** is that he **receives them humbly (容而下之)**,\npossessing the **Way of descending to those below (下下之道)**.\nThus, those nearby **sing and rejoice (讴歌而乐)**,\nand those far away **exert themselves to approach (竭蹶而趋)**,\nlike water flowing downward,\nabundantly and irresistibly (沛然莫之能御).\nThe **Scripture (经)** says:\n*\"The Dao in the world is like the rivers and valleys to Jianghai.\nThe people’s **returning and drawing (归往)**—\nis it not similar?\"*\nYet, the Sage’s sequence states *\"the ruler descends to those below (君能下下)\"*,\nand the *\"Book of Poetry (诗)\"* says *\"there is none who does not comply (无不尔哉)\"*—\ndoes this not follow the **Way of knowing how to descend (知善下之道)\"**?\n\nThus, the **Sage (圣人)** desires to **elevate others (上人)**,\nyet speaks of **descending (言下之)**;\ndesires to **go before others (先人)**,\nyet **follows in body (以其身后之)**.\nThus, the **Sage (圣人)**,\nthough **in the highest position (处上)**,\ndoes not make others **heavy (人不重)**,\nthough **in the forefront (处前)**,\ndoes not make others **harmed (人不害)**—\nthus the world **rejoices to push him forward (乐推)** and does not **weary (厌)**.\n\nThe **Huizong (徽宗)** annotation states:\n*\"The *Yijing (易)* in the *Tún (屯)* hexagram’s first line says:\n*'With the noble descending to the base, great is the people’s compliance (以贵下贱，大得民也).'*\nHe who **gains the people (得其民者)**,\n**gains their hearts (得其心也)**.\nWhen **in the highest

(对言之)**,\nthen it is certainly **not to be debated (固不可以议)**.*\n\nI hold three treasures, treasures to be cherished.\nHuizong’s annotation: Different from the common world’s perception, yet guarded without loss, these are the treasures I hold.\nExegesis: The Sage differs from the virtuous; viewing the Sage through the eyes of the virtuous still reveals distinctions—how much more so with the vulgar’s perspective? Their divergence is profound indeed.\nThe so-called three treasures: In the vulgar world, they are obscured by private views, mistakenly deemed small. Yet when viewed through principle, they are what constitutes the great.\nTo differ from the vulgar’s perception and guard them without loss—then one embraces them well without abandoning them, never for a moment separated. This may truly be called cherishing and holding them.\n\nThe Confucian scholar does not treasure gold and jade but holds loyalty and trust as treasures, thus knowing that my three treasures lie within, not without, and must be held to their utmost.\n\nAlas, the vulgar man treasures his treasures yet fails to treasure their essence, making them burdens upon himself. Hence, those who treasure pearls and jade invite calamity upon themselves.\n\n**First: Benevolence.**\nHuizong’s annotation: Benevolence loves all things; it is the substance of virtue.\nExegesis: Benevolence takes compassion for all as its heart; virtue takes love for humanity as its foundation. Thus, filial piety begins with a father’s benevolence, and feasting demonstrates benevolent kindness. Ultimately, all stem from love—how could benevolence not be the substance of virtue?\nLaozi spoke of Dao and virtue, rejecting virtue yet treasuring this; he did not reject it but sought to clarify virtue’s essence.\n\n**Second: Frugality.**\nHuizong’s annotation: Frugality ensures sufficiency; it is the moderation of ritual.\nExegesis: Frugality is the common virtue; ritual values appropriate use. Thus, frugality without ritual leads to universal scarcity, while frugality with ritual is fitting. Ultimately, all honor sufficiency—how could frugality not be the moderation of ritual?\nConfucius said, *\"Rather be frugal than extravagant\"*—he did not mean miserliness but sought to clarify ritual’s moderation.\n\n**Third: Not daring to lead the world.**\nHuizong’s annotation: To lead is to seek victory over others, to value strength over virtue.\nExegesis: There is a constant way of victory called softness, and a constant way of defeat called rigidity.\nSoftness does not seek victory over others; it manifests as yielding, weakness, and humility, yet none can contend with it.\nRigidity seeks victory over others; though it strives to excel, how can it always excel?\nIf one can be rigid yet not soft, leading to seek victory over others, then one values strength over virtue.\nStrength is the beginning of contention; valuing strength means favoring bravery, and things will oppose it—like Zhuangzi’s *\"using cleverness to contend with strength.\"*\nHumility is the handle of virtue; valuing virtue means softness and compliance, and none can demean it—like the *Yijing*’s *\"Heaven, Earth, humanity, and spirits all take from humility.\"*\nThen, those who seek victory over others value strength over virtue—how can they compare to those who do not seek victory, valuing virtue over strength?\nTo not value strength is to know not to dare lead the world, to humble oneself and advance in virtue. Thus, restrained in bearing, it becomes the corner of virtue.\n\nBenevolence, therefore, brings courage.\nHuizong’s annotation: King Wen viewed the people as wounded; his anger settled the world’s people.\nExegesis: The virtuous must be courageous; thus, those who love others abhor harm to them.\nThe virtuous must have authority; thus, constant virtue suffices to establish martial affairs.\nKing Wen cherished the common people, benefiting widows and orphans. Mencius called his care for the people like tending to wounds—truly benevolent.\nWhen his wrath flared, he disciplined his troops and achieved martial triumphs, conquering the exalted. His anger settled the world’s people—his courage was unmatched.\nThus, benevolence brings courage; this is evident.\n\nFrugality, therefore, brings breadth.\nHuizong’s annotation: Store in winter, and abundance will flourish in spring.\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot always indulge in excess; how much more so for humanity?\nExegesis: The *Yijing* says: *\"Kān is concealment and withdrawal.\"*\nKān corresponds to the north in direction and winter in season, where all things retreat—thus, concealment is spoken of in winter.\nIt also says: *\"Zhèn is flourishing and abundance.\"*\nZhèn corresponds to the east in direction and spring in season, where all things emerge—thus, abundance is spoken of in spring.\nOnly by concealing in winter does abundance come in spring. The movement of qi and the principles of all things have their own times of waxing and waning, their own measures of fullness and contraction. Heaven and Earth provide for all without ever indulging, transform into all things without ever wasting—thus even they cannot always indulge in excess. It is because they do not indulge in excess that they achieve such breadth. Examined in human affairs, it is also that frugality brings breadth.\n\nNot daring to lead the world, therefore, completes the vessel and makes it long-lasting.\nHuizong’s annotation: The Dao does not contend yet triumphs—this is Heaven’s way. The Dao’s exaltation makes it the longest-lasting vessel.\nExegesis: Heaven is the parent of all things, transforming and nurturing, silently revolving in the boundless void. All things move and act through its mechanisms; those that emerge, it aids without hesitation; those that return to their roots, it guides without obstruction. It follows things’ natural course, aligning with their inherent principles.\nYet those confined by the numbers of birth and death all receive their mandates here, unable to escape its keys—thus, the Dao does not contend yet triumphs.\nThe Dao’s exaltation is first among all things, and none can demean it; hence, it is the longest-lasting vessel.\n\n---\n\n「Laozi states: *The sage employs the Way of the feminine*—when used, it becomes the foundation for leadership.\nHuizong’s annotation: The sage comprehends the Dao’s boundless nature, dwelling in the world as though in a realm of non-contention, and none dare contend with him. The Great Dao already flows—how could it not be that which the world follows first, thus attaining the status of the longest-lasting vessel?\n\nNow, abandoning the Way of the feminine yet clinging to the masculine, abandoning frugality yet seeking extravagance, abandoning humility yet aspiring to preeminence—this is the path of death.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: The world’s people know that courage suffices to overcome others, yet do not know that compassion alone can foster true courage. They know that generosity can dazzle the multitude, yet do not know that restraint alone can sustain true abundance. They know that leadership is esteemed, yet do not know that yielding precedence is the essential key. Thus, they are but the followers of brute strength, and their way is one of death.\n\nExegesis: The Three Treasures are the true essence of nature, not contrivances of human artifice. Only when one forgets both self and object can they truly treasure and uphold them. The world’s people, however, chase after superficial truths while abandoning the genuine, blinded to ultimate principles. They oppose objects with their own ego, clashing at every turn, knowing only that courage suffices to overcome others, boasting in strength, yet unaware that compassion alone can forge invincibility—*as the scriptures say: \"The seven virtues make one unstoppable.\"* They know that generosity can dazzle the multitude, indulging in ostentation, yet fail to grasp that restraint alone can ensure true abundance—*as the sages say: \"Use it without exhausting it.\"* They know that leadership is esteemed, striving to excel in ability, yet do not understand that yielding precedence is the true path—*as the scriptures say: \"He who yields precedence is first among men.\"* These are but the followers of rigidity and force; their way is one of death. Hence it is said: *The obstinate die the death of the strong.*\n\nIn ancient times, Zhuangzi spoke of the *Perfect Person* (博大真人) and said: *\"He is always expansive toward things, never diminished by others—thus, compassion is known.\"* *\"He moves with ease yet never wastes—taking moderation as his standard—thus, frugality is known.\"* *\"While others take precedence, he alone takes last—thus, he does not dare to lead the world first.\"* If Laozi were such a man, he could truly be said to embody these teachings, not only manifesting them in words but also demonstrating them in deed. Yet the world’s people pick up these fragments and call them *rigidity and strength*, risking their own lives without reflection. Truly, they are the *blinded and deluded masses.*\n\nCompassion, when wielded like a shield, becomes invincible. When held as a fortress, it becomes unshakable.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: The virtuous man is unstoppable in the world—thus, compassion makes him invincible in battle. The people love their ruler as hands and feet defend the head, as children protect their parents and elder siblings—dying for him without hesitation. Thus, compassion makes him unshakable in defense.\n\nExegesis: Mencius said: *\"When a ruler loves virtue, the world has no rival.\"* That is, the virtuous man is unstoppable in the world, for the people’s affection lies in virtue. The virtuous man, without rival, can thus awaken great benefit and align with the great harmony. The people’s return to virtue is like water flowing downward—inevitable. Thus, compassion makes him invincible in battle, achieving total victory. The *Book of Documents* says: *\"The people have no constant grievance, only grievance when virtue is absent.\"* Xunzi said: *\"The people love their ruler as hands and feet defend the head, as children protect their parents and elder siblings.\"* Therefore, when the people’s loyalty is rooted in virtue, compassion makes him unshakable in defense.\n\nIn ancient times, King Tang of Shang conquered through kindness and virtue, and thus his courageous deeds were celebrated, none daring to refuse his offerings. This was the virtuous man’s unstoppable way in the world. King Tai of Zhou had boundless virtue, so the people of Qin followed him as though returning to their marketplace. This was the people’s love for their ruler. Those above, with virtue and benevolence, are unstoppable; those below, with sincere and willing hearts, love their ruler. Thus, compassion makes him invincible in battle, unshakable in defense.\n\nCompassion as a treasure—how could its value be slight? Heaven, when it would save and protect, does so with compassion.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: Those who aspire to virtue are drawn by Heaven’s favor. Those who reject virtue are stripped by Heaven’s judgment. Thus, Heaven saves and protects through compassion alone—this is why compassion is first among the Three Treasures.\n\nExegesis: Those who exhaust their hearts know their nature. Those who know their nature know Heaven. Virtue is rooted in the inherent nature of all beings, a mandate from Heaven. Only by embodying virtue can one fulfill their nature; only by fulfilling their nature can one align with Heaven. Thus, those who aspire to virtue are drawn by Heaven’s favor—*as the scriptures say: \"Nurture the good, bless the benevolent, bestow a hundred blessings upon those who do good.\"* Those who reject virtue are stripped by Heaven’s judgment—*as the scriptures say: \"Overturn the wicked, punish the licentious, bring a hundred calamities upon those who do evil.\"* Therefore, those who follow the Dao are good, and those who lead with goodness are virtuous. Heaven’s Way is impartial, always rewarding the good. It saves them to make them secure, protects them to make them steadfast—all because of their goodness in compassion. This is why compassion is first among the Three Treasures, and also why virtue is the overarching name for all goodness, the consummation of humanity’s path. None can surpass the love of virtue.\n\n*The Great Learning of the True Classic (道德真经疏义) concludes Volume XII, begins Volume XIII.*\n\nThe *Great Learning of the True Classic* (《道德真经疏义》), Volume XIII, Chapter LXVIII: **\"The Virtuous Scholar Does Not Rely on Force\"**\n\nThe virtuous scholar does not rely on force.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Force is the lower path; the scholar’s virtue lies in cultivating *ren* and *yi* alone.\nConfucius said: *\"I have not studied military affairs.\"*\n\n*The Causal Exegesis explains:* The maneuvers of the three armies and five weapons are but the lesser applications of virtue. What is lesser was practiced by the ancients, yet not their priority—thus, force is the lower path. The scholar’s aspiration lies in the Dao, so cultivating noble intent is paramount.\n*The Records* say: *\"The scholar’s first concern is intent.\"*\nZhuangzi said: *\"The worthy scholar values intent.\"*\nAll speak of the scholar’s purpose being to uphold lofty and enlightened intent, not to labor over the lesser applications of virtue. What intent should be cherished? Simply *ren* and *yi*.\n\nTo dwell in *ren* is to find a secure abode, fostering a heart that cannot bear to harm others. Thus, to kill the innocent is not *ren*.\nTo follow *yi*’s straight path means taking only what is just. Thus, to take what is not yours is not *yi*.\nThe virtuous scholar does not rely on force, nor does he delight in killing to harm *ren*, nor in taking to harm *yi*.\nConfucius’ teachings also say: *\"I have not studied military affairs.\"*\n\nThus, if the scholar’s intent is in the Dao, how can he neglect the root—*ren* and *yi*—and act otherwise? This is why Zhongyou could be brave yet cowardly, earning reproach at the Sage’s gate.\n\nThe skilled warrior does not rage.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* The highest strategy is to subdue through planning, yet rage truly overcomes deliberation.\n*The Causal Exegesis explains:* The威 of virtue is perfected in tranquility and strength. The Sage’s martial prowess shines without haste, yet its effects arrive without movement; divine martial might does not kill, its influence is unfathomable yet profound. By calculating strategy, victory is secured at ten thousand *li*—even the wisest cannot devise such schemes. Though military doctrine values the highest strategy of subduing through planning, it achieves victory without battle. Why then resort to clashing arms and indulge in rage?\n\nThe Five Phases’ principle holds that wood overcomes earth, and among the Seven Emotions, rage overcomes thought. What is meant by *\"rage truly overcomes thought\"* is that it stems not from true virtue, but is driven by external influences. Yet the highest strategy of subduing through planning requires no rage at all.\n\nKing Wen’s display of righteous fury was but human rage in response to human rage. To match the people’s rage with rage is to share their breath, differing only in that it is not private fury. What is called *\"emitting rage without raging\"* is rage arising from non-rage. Only by understanding this can one speak of the skilled warrior not raging.\n\nThe one who best conquers enemies does not contend.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Contention is contrary to virtue. To fight for land fills the fields with the dead; to fight for cities fills the cities with the dead—victory and defeat remain undetermined.\n*The Causal Exegesis explains:* Arms are laid down yet mobilized in due time. The virtuous one displays virtue, not force, aligning with the people’s hearts and following their desires—thus, contention is contrary to virtue. To contend is to crave battle and delight in slaughter: fighting for land fills the fields with the dead, yet external threats remain unchecked; fighting for cities fills the cities with the dead, yet internal strife persists. If so, cycles of expansion and contraction ensue, with victory and defeat still uncertain.\n\nOnly the virtuous scholar does not rely on force to perfect his martial virtue, thus embracing *ren* without fail and revering *yi* without hesitation—this is to campaign with *ren* and *yi*.\nOnly the skilled warrior does not rage to fulfill his rage, thus acting with purpose and achieving merit—this is to wield威 without raging.\nOnly the one who best conquers enemies does not contend to suppress contention, thus winning in battle and holding firm in defense—this is to conquer without contention.\n\nBy this, the realm is preserved, achievements secured, the people at ease, and the masses harmonized. The seven virtues of martial prowess lie here. These three principles all stem from virtue. Since they stem from virtue, their perfection is evident—thus, they are called *shàn* (virtuous).\n\nThis is the constant virtue underlying martial affairs—what makes *constant martial virtue* beautiful?\n\nThe skilled user of men is beneath them.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Though wisdom encompasses heaven and earth, the Sage does not deliberate alone—thus, the wise are employed for counsel. Though ability exhausts the land, the Sage does not act alone—thus, the capable are employed for service. Though eloquence carves through all things, the Sage does not speak alone—thus, the eloquent are employed as messengers.\n\n*The Causal Exegesis explains:* Those who embody the Dao act without action yet are honored; those who handle affairs act with action yet are burdened. The Sage must act without action to govern the world—this is embodying the Dao. The subjects must act with action to serve the world—this is handling affairs. Only by embodying the Dao does one assign responsibility to those who handle affairs. Only by acting without action does one employ those who act with action.\n\nThus, the Sage’s wisdom, though vast as heaven and earth, does not deliberate alone—this is to say wisdom permeates the divine, yet he employs others’ wisdom, so the wise are his counselors, as the saying goes: *\"The utmost wisdom does not plot.\"*\nThough ability exhausts the land, the Sage does not act alone—this is to say he employs others’ abilities, so the capable serve as his agents, as the saying goes: *\"Great skill appears as clumsiness.\"*\nThough eloquence carves through all things, the Sage does not speak alone—this is to say he employs others’ eloquence, so the eloquent serve as his messengers, as the saying goes: *\"Great eloquence does not speak.\"*\n\nThus, by not self-using, others willingly serve him. This is called the virtue of non-contention.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Virtue transcends reputation; knowledge arises from contention. Those whose talents are whole yet whose virtue is unseen have never been heard to initiate—only to harmonize with others.\n\nThe *Shuyi* says:\n\nWhen nurturing harmony, one preserves internally without dissipation—why seek reputation?\nThe wise cultivate tranquility, and harmony arises naturally from one’s nature—why engage in contention?\nIf virtue transcends reputation, others will also vie for it through reputation.\nIf wisdom arises from contention, others will also contend with me in wisdom.\nOnly those whose talents are whole and whose virtue remains unseen—\nwho dwell in the harmony of virtue’s transformation of things,\nseeing what is singular without perceiving what is lost—\nthen bear no burden of reputation or contention.\n\nWhat is meant by *talents whole*?\nNot disrupting harmony, yet bringing spring to all things.\nWhat is meant by *virtue unseen*?\nNot losing one’s nature, yet returning to the original virtue.\n\nStanding alone in the realm of non-contention,\nnever leading but always following others,\nas if riding the harmony of others without initiating—\nthis is surely one whose talents are whole and whose virtue remains unseen.\nThus, the Master said: *\"Never heard to initiate—only to harmonize with others.\"*\nIf not the virtue of non-contention, what else could this be?\nThis is called *employing others’ strength*.\n\n「Huizong’s commentary states: The *clever* exhaust their sight and hearing, the *capable* exhaust their planning and abilities, yet those who hold positions know nothing.\n\nThe *Explanations of Meaning* say: Those entrusted with the tasks of ears and eyes must surely possess *cleverness* to exhaust their sight and hearing. For those who discern through vision, clarity comes first; those who perceive through hearing, *cleverness* is prized. Only by letting the near reveal their clarity and the distant reveal their *cleverness* can one fully grasp the myriad circumstances of all things.\n\nThose entrusted with the tasks of the heart and strength must surely possess *capable* wisdom to exhaust their planning and abilities. For those skilled in planning, their wisdom is unobstructed; those skilled in strength, their vigor is unflagging. Only by internally wielding their wisdom and externally diligently applying their strength can one fully achieve the results of their undertakings.\n\nThe Sage surveys widely and listens inclusively, entrusts the *clever* and employs the *capable*—this is merely an excess of affairs. What enables them to utilize the world without self-assertion is their embodiment of the Dao’s *non-action* (wuwei). The *Classic* says:\n\n*\"Cleverness and wisdom, guard them with simplicity;\nBravery and strength to pacify the world, guard them with caution.\"*\n\nWhat is meant by *\"those who hold positions know nothing\"*? Does it not declare this truth? This is called *harmonizing with Heaven*—the ultimate of antiquity.\n\nHuizong’s commentary states: *Non-action* (wuwei) for action is what is called *Heaven*. Without contention yet employing others, one can thus *harmonize with Heaven*. To *harmonize with Heaven* is to reach the utmost; nothing can be added beyond this, hence it is called the *ultimate of antiquity*. *Ultimate* means *utmost*. The *house ridgepole* is the *utmost* of wood.\n\nThe *Explanations of Meaning* say: Heaven acts through *non-action* (wuwei) to maintain its clarity, and all things flourish, each following their natural growth from *non-action*. Thus, *non-action* for action is what is called *Heaven*.\n\nThe Sage engages in *non-action* (wuwei), thus aligning with Heaven’s *virtue/power*. Without contention yet employing others, it is as though the boundless void nurtures life—creation and transformation occur subtly, and the Sage merely entrusts the Six Qi (六氣) to their own unfolding. Hence, one can *harmonize with Heaven*. Those who record rituals say:\n\n*\"High and bright, harmonizing with Heaven,\nmust be followed by *non-action* (wuwei) to complete,\nthus aligning with Heaven’s *virtue/power*.\"*\n\nTo align with Heaven’s *virtue/power* is to ascend with the Creator of all things and transcend all existence—this is called *harmonizing with Heaven*. If so, then one has reached the *utmost*, beyond which nothing can be added, hence it is called the *ultimate of antiquity*. For *ultimate* speaks of the *utmost*—if like the *Great Ultimate* (太极), then its *utmost* is in *height*; if like the *Boundless Ultimate* (无极), then its *utmost* is in *distance*. The *house ridgepole* merely signifies the *utmost* of wood.\n\nIn the art of war, there is a saying: *\"I dare not be the host but only the guest.\"*\n\n「Thus, the *Huizong* commentary states: Those who *respond* are the *host* (主), those who *stimulate* are the *guest* (客). Only when pressed does one act, only when compelled does one rise—this is called *responsive warfare* (应兵). *Responsive warfare* is the *guest*’s way.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: The martial virtue of the sage does not rely on brute strength to turn the heavens and earth, yet the world cannot perceive its vigor; nor does it exhaust the wisdom of the gods, yet no one can fathom its depths. For those who command generals and lead armies like teachers, sharing the people’s sufferings—when *stimulated*, they *respond*, yet they dare not assert dominance. Only because they do not seek to overpower others, they are the *host* when *stimulated*, and the *guest* when *responding*. Pressed before they move, their actions are timely—this is the meaning of *\"arms are laid aside but act when the moment comes.\"* Compelled before they rise, their rise is decisive yet unavoidable—this is the meaning of *\"only when unavoidable do they act, and tranquility is the highest virtue.\"*\n\nIf so, then the first principle is to be *unconquerable*—waiting for the enemy’s conquerable moment to *respond* as *responsive warfare*, the *guest*’s way. As the *guest*, one displays the *prolonged weakness* (绵绵之弱), aligning with Sunzi’s saying: *\"The skilled victor stands in unconquerable ground.\"* One does not dare advance an inch but retreats a foot.\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: Because one does not delight in killing, advancing is difficult yet retreating is easy.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: Facing arrows and spears, confronting blades and barbs—by means of arms, it is harsh; by nature, it is perilous. How could one willingly engage in such warfare? The general’s purpose is only to curb violence, lay down arms, pacify the people, and harmonize the multitudes. The essence of command lies in self-preservation in warfare, and in halting the blades in martial virtue. It is never the intent to revel in killing. Because one does not delight in killing, advancing is difficult yet retreating is easy. Difficult to advance speaks to having something to defend—not cowardice in advancing, but knowing that defense alone ensures steadfastness. Easy to retreat speaks to having something to heed—not recklessness in retreating, but avoiding profit and courting danger. In the *Great Marshal’s* (《大司马》) teachings on battle formations, during hunting exercises, one is trained in sitting, rising, advancing, and retreating, with rhythms of swiftness, slowness, density, and sparseness. Sometimes, when the drum signals advance, one strikes the *bracelet* (镯) to regulate it; when the drum signals retreat, one sounds the *gong* (铙) to halt it. How much more so when facing the enemy—should one not carefully weigh the timing of advance and retreat?\n\nThe *Art of War* states: *\"Unmoving as a mountain, taking its steadfastness and stillness.\"* It also says: *\"Its swiftness like the wind, taking its speed and agility.\"* Only by understanding this can one grasp the profound meaning behind *\"not daring to advance an inch but retreating a foot\"*—this is the true essence.\n\nThis is called *\"action without action\"* (行无行).\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: The skilled warrior does not rely on martial force but acts without trace.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: Martial force is inferior to the *Dao/Way*; it is the lowest form of *virtue/power*. The warrior’s aspiration lies in the *Dao/Way* and is rooted in *virtue/power*, hence the skilled warrior does not rely on martial force. Moreover, even the grand armies of three divisions and five kinds of troops depend on the *spirit* and *movement* of the general’s will—so subtle as to be formless. How could martial force be visibly displayed? It is fitting that one acts without trace, that martial resolve lies in the will rather than in the deeds, and that its subtlety cannot be observed from the sidelines. There should be no need for the *phoenix* to parade in splendid towers or the *steed* to stand idle in the imperial stables, should there?\n\n*\"Defend without limbs\"* (攘无臂).\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: The skilled warrior does not rage.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: The benevolent must have courage, yet though they do not rage, their *威* (awe) remains. The *Odes* say: *\"Like thunder, like fury.\"* Though described as fury, it arises from non-fury—this is the meaning of *\"the skilled warrior does not rage.\"*\n\n*\"Unmatched without rival\"* (仍无敌).\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: The skilled victor over enemies does not contend.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: The benevolent have no rivals, yet though they do not contend, they prevail. The *Odes* say: *\"None dare contend in their season.\"* Only because they do not contend, others cease their contention—this is the meaning of *\"the skilled victor over enemies does not contend.\"*\n\n*\"Hold without arms\"* (执无兵).\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: One relies on others’ strength, hence there is no need to wield arms.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: The priority of arms is to attach to the people; the *Dao/Way* of warfare is to harmonize with them. Thus, the skilled in attaching to the people are the skilled in warfare. Benevolent rulers above and below, a hundred generals with one heart, three armies united in strength—like children serving their parents and brothers, like limbs protecting the head. When prolonged, it is like the long blade of *Mo Ye* (莫耶), and those who grasp it are severed; when sharp, it is like the keen edge of *Mo Ye*, and those who face it are routed. All this depends on the strength of others—what need is there to wield arms?\n\nMencius said: *\"One who commands awe over the world does not rely on the sharpness of arms, but gains the *Dao/Way* and receives much assistance.\"* The utmost of receiving assistance means the world submits to it; there are some conflicts one does not engage in, yet when one does, victory is certain—this is the meaning of *\"relying on others’ strength.\"* To form the *arc* and *arrow* to command awe over the world is not to say one does not rely on the sharpness of arms. It is to say that *root* triumphs over *branch*—the emphasis lies in the strength of others, not in the sharpness of arms. This is the meaning of *\"no need to wield arms.\"*」\n\nMencius said: *\"He who does not delight in killing can unite the world. Then it is known that those who delight in killing cannot achieve their ambitions in the world—this aligns with the words of Laozi without prior agreement.*\n\nThus, when armies clash in confrontation, the compassionate will prevail. The *Huizong* commentary states: *\"The Sage’s use of arms is to rescue the people from fire and water, taking only the remnants of the wicked. Divine and martial, yet refraining from killing, the Sage treasures compassion as his jewel. Thus, *ren* (virtue/power of benevolence) permeates the world without fail, and *yi* (virtue/power of righteousness) commands reverence, making this the way of constant victory.\"*\n\nThe *Shuyi* (explanatory notes) say: *\"The Sage rules the world, nurturing the people as a father. Heaven covers, Earth sustains, the seas embrace and spring nurtures—how could the Sage allow these people to perish in suffering without restraining their violence? Therefore, when forced to use arms to rescue the people from fire and water, taking only the remnants of the wicked, the tyrant has no place to stand.*\n\nWho but the wise and enlightened, divine and martial yet refraining from killing, could match this? Indeed, the divine and martial who refrain from killing do not subjugate all things through sheer force—this is how they win hearts and minds, drawing them with *virtue/power* and treasuring compassion as their jewel. Yet, what is this *virtue/power*? It is merely *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness).*\n\nThus, when *ren* (benevolence) permeates the world without fail, it is because the Sage abhors harming others—this is the meaning of *ren* (benevolence) embracing all. When *yi* (righteousness) commands reverence, it is because the Sage upholds order and abhors chaos—this is the meaning of *virtue/power* and awe inspiring fear. But if it is said that the Sage treasures compassion as his jewel and that *ren* (benevolence) embraces all, while *yi* (righteousness) commands fear, how is this possible?\n\nIt is because when *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness) are practiced, both awe and love are achieved—compassion allows for courage. This aligns with Zhuang Zhou’s words: *‘Naturally benevolent and compassionate, yet never forgetting to use benevolence as a gift and righteousness as principle.’* If *ren* (benevolence) embraces all and *yi* (righteousness) commands fear, then the people will willingly submit, their hearts content and their minds sincerely obedient. The next level of victory is truly insignificant—this is the way of constant victory, is it not?\n\nIn ancient times, King Tang of Shang ruled with *‘not competing, not contending’* to spread his governance, thus exhausting the work of *ren* (benevolence). He wielded *‘not startling, not moving’* to display his courage, thus exhausting the work of *yi* (righteousness). Both *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness) fully realized, he could act without constraint and yet gather the fruits of victory—who would dare resist? Is this not the way of constant victory rooted in *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness)?\n\nMy words are very easy to understand, very easy to practice.\"\n\nThe world cannot know it, cannot practice it.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: The Dao shines brightly and is easy to see, hence when it is expressed in words, it is very easy to know; it is essential and easy to uphold, hence when it manifests in deeds, it is very easy to practice.\n\nMencius said: \"The Dao is like a great road—how difficult could it be to know?\"\n\nThus, the Dao has no difficulty, and the world has no one who cannot grasp it. Yet there are those who deceive themselves into believing they cannot—it is only because they do not reflect and seek within themselves.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: The Dao is lofty and beautiful, shining brightly and easily seen, hence when expressed in words, it is as clear as the sun and stars, making it very easy to know. The Dao is unified and penetrates all things, essential and easy to uphold, hence when seen in deeds, it is precise as a level and plumb line, making it very easy to practice.\n\nIf we clarify this through the teachings of the Six Classics, the Dao becomes even more evident and easy to grasp. For instance:\n- The *Book of Poetry* teaches *wēnróu dūnhòu* (gentle, kind, and thickly virtuous),\n- The *Book of Documents* teaches *shūtōng zhīyuǎn* (open and far-reaching),\n- And so on, extending to *guǎngbó yìliáng* (broad and easy to be good), *jiéjìng jīngwēi* (pure and refined), *gōngjiǎn zhuāngqīn* (reverent, frugal, and dignified), and the use of metaphor and analogy—all are manifestations of the Dao in words. By examining its expressions to seek its meaning, knowing it is not difficult.\n\nThe *Book of Poetry* guides the will,\nThe *Book of Documents* guides action,\nAnd so on—guiding conduct, guiding harmony, guiding yin and yang, guiding names and distinctions—all are manifestations of the Dao in deeds. By examining its deeds to understand its principles, practicing it is not difficult.\n\nTruly, Mencius’ words are profound: \"The Dao is like a great road—how difficult could it be to know?\" The Dao is the path all people share, like a great road. Traveling in and out, coming and going, none can stray beyond it. The world has no one who cannot grasp it, yet there are those who deceive themselves into believing they cannot—it is only because they walk in darkness, or wander into narrow paths, or turn back at cliffs, or abandon the way halfway. All this stems from their lack of reflection. The reason they cannot grasp it is that they do not reflect and seek within themselves.\n\nIf they knew that everyone holds something precious within themselves, and could reflect and seek within, then the Dao would be near—there is no need to seek it far away, and the Dao would dwell within them.\n\nLaozi’s teaching must say, *\"My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice.\"* Truly, he wished that all in the world and future generations would know to seek within themselves, to delve deeply into the Dao.\n\nWords have their root, deeds have their master.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: Words are boundless, yet principle is their foundation. Deeds are countless, yet the Dao is their sovereign.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: The expression of the heart’s voice arises spontaneously, without limit, and cannot be measured by clever calculations—this is why words are boundless. Yet they are expressed through metaphors and analogies, all of which are words, and though principle cannot be exhausted by these metaphors, it is never outside them. Thus, words have principle as their foundation.\n\nThe affairs of life are vast and endless, rushing by without measure—this is why deeds are boundless. Yet they are governed by standards and measures, all of which are deeds, and though the Dao cannot be sought in these standards, it is never separate from them. Thus, deeds have the Dao as their sovereign.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"When two households debate, which side’s argument is more biased in principle?\"* If one’s words must return to ultimate principle, then it is clear that words have principle as their foundation. Yet principle is called the foundation because it aligns with the saying *\"follow its root.\"*\n\nAgain, he said: *\"To unite with the One is to complete all things.\"* If deeds encompass the Dao and advance to it, then it is clear that deeds have the Dao as their sovereign. Yet the Dao is also called the master because it aligns with the saying *\"the key lies in the master.\"*\n\nPrinciple can be followed but not defied—if one seeks it in accordance with principle, they will find it. When principle flows naturally, then words align with it, and though it can be followed, it cannot be lost. Only by following the Dao in action can one truly embody it, making the heart harmonize with the Dao. Then deeds align with the Dao, words align with principle, and deeds align with the Dao—holding this as verification and standard, there is no action that cannot succeed. The world has no difficulty.\n\nTo say it is easy to know and easy to practice—how could it not be true?\n\nIt is only the ignorant who do not know me.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: The petty scholar’s knowledge does not transcend documents—though they claim knowledge, they truly lack it. How could they understand the Dao?\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: With a mind emptied and still, one can observe both near and far, delve into mysteries, uncover the hidden, and reach the profound—then wisdom is great indeed. The petty scholar’s wisdom is blinded by self-interest, and what they know does not extend beyond documents. Their spirit is wasted in shallow pursuits. Though they claim wisdom, it does not extend beyond the four seas—knowing the minutiae of hair and fur while ignorant of great peace, they claim knowledge yet truly lack it. How could they understand the Dao?\n\nWithout the Dao, one cannot truly know—because their knowledge cannot reach it.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"To know the Dao is easy.\"* Only through profound insight and discernment, by treating ignorance as true knowledge, can one truly know. The petty and selfish in wisdom are not free from burdens, and to seek true knowledge is indeed arduous.\n\nFew understand me, hence I am precious.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: Those with lofty conduct in the world are condemned by the crowd, and those with unique wisdom are startled by the people. Thus, there are those who are noble precisely because they are few.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: To stand out and excel is lofty conduct in the world. Those with lofty conduct are rarely recognized by the common crowd, hence they are condemned by the masses, for the masses judge only by their own biased likes and dislikes. To preserve the spirit and seek the ultimate is wisdom beyond the petty—those with such wisdom are rarely understood by the narrow-minded, hence they are startled by the people, for the people are deeply mired in ignorance and delusion.\n\nThe censure of others arises from their difference, and the scorn of the people stems from their arrogance—like the cuckoo mocking the progress of the *Nanqi* stream, or the well-frog belittling the joys of the Eastern Sea. How often one sees their lack of measure!\n\nTo seek the reason for this, they are obscured by one-sided views, and their limited clarity is insufficient to attain true knowledge.\n\nThe *Transmission* says: There is nothing in the world more esteemed than the **Dao**. The **Dao** is esteemed above all because it cannot be known by knowing.\n\nIf shallow perception and meager understanding were sufficient to grasp the **Dao**, then what would make the **Dao** so precious?\n\nOnly because few understand me, am I precious.\n\nThe *Records* speak of those who are noble because they are few—truly, this lies in the fact that few understand me, hence I am esteemed by the world.\n\nThus, the Sage wears coarse robes while harboring precious jade.\n\n**Huizong’s annotation:** The Sage is hidden within Heaven, yet does not peddle himself in the marketplace.\n\n**Cushui commentary:** The subtle essence of the **Dao** is never openly displayed, and the origin of things from the **Dao** is never known. The Sage is the ultimate of the **Dao**, merging with Heaven in emptiness—his concealment is profound.\n\nFrom the perspective of his completeness within Heaven, he follows the natural order of Heaven, rests in its equilibrium, and moves without progress as Heaven’s play, acts without strife as Heaven’s mechanism. Observing Heaven without interference, rejoicing in Heaven without sorrow—these are all harmonizing with Heaven through Heaven, employing wondrous yet effortless use, surpassing mere goodness. To exert force and conceal it is to be hidden within Heaven.\n\nNow, to hide a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh may be called secure, yet there are times when it is lost. To hide gold in mountains or pearls in the depths may be called secret, yet there are times when it is lost. This is because what is hidden is in things, not in the **Dao**.\n\nThe Sage returns to the origin of nature, uniting with Heaven as one—how different this is! How could he take pleasure in worldly affairs, selling himself like a merchant?\n\nThe pretense of virtuous conduct is akin to selling jade as stone. The self-promotion of skill is like hawking techniques for gold. Not selling himself in the marketplace, the brightest virtue appears as humiliation, and great virtue seems as foolishness—this is to show that it has never emerged from his lineage.\n\nTo show that it has never emerged from his lineage, it is fitting that even the later generations cannot compare.\n\nTo know what is unknown is exalted.\n\n**Huizong’s annotation:** The essence of the supreme **Dao** is dim and obscure; the extreme of the **Dao** is hazy and silent. Knowing transcends it externally, while ignorance resides within it; knowing is shallow, while ignorance runs deep. To say \"I do not know\" is true knowing—the ultimate of the **Dao**, hence it is exalted.\n\n**Cushui commentary:** To emerge and interact with things is to reach no limit; to retreat and discern within is to reach a limit. The **Dao** attains its ultimate when it retreats to discern within things.\n\nTo retreat and discern within things is beyond what can be known by knowing—how much more so when it is dim and obscure, merging in the undifferentiated chaos, the spirit of spirits, yet able to refine itself? How much more so when it is hazy and silent, hidden beyond speech and intent, where things cannot be measured, yet all consider it the extreme?\n\nWho would say that knowing can seek its ultimate?\n\nBroadly, Guangchengzi said: \"The essence of the supreme **Dao** is dim and obscure; the extreme of the **Dao** is hazy and silent\"—this is because the **Dao** is not something that knowing can know.\n\nWhen Taiqing asked about the boundless, he said, *\"I do not know.\"* When asked about non-action, he said, *\"I know.\"* The **Dao** uses these two statements—how does one determine which is correct and which is false?\n\nThis is because one has not yet understood that *not-knowing* is knowing, and knowing is *not-knowing*. This is why there are distinctions of depth and shallowness, interior and exterior. Thus, it is said: knowing transcends it externally, while ignorance resides within it; knowing is shallow, while ignorance runs deep.\n\nOnly knowing what is unknown is true knowing.\n\nIf so, then transcending form and emerging beyond the realm of being and non-being, standing aloof without associating with things—one can intuitively grasp it in silence.\n\nWhat in the world is more exalted than this? Hence it is said: *To know what is unknown is exalted.*\n\nTo not know what is known is a sickness.\n\n**Huizong’s annotation:** To not know the essence of the supreme **Dao** while knowing the coarse aspects of things, to not know the extreme of the **Dao** while knowing the trivial ends of things—already enslaved to trifles, already entangled by things, yet they say they tread the path of sorrow and calamity. Hence, it is a sickness.\n\n**Cushui commentary:** Clarity arises from emptiness, awareness from stillness. The realm of Taiqing is initially free of any obstruction. Once false perceptions arise, the empty and still mind is suddenly immersed in things, and what is known is coarse while the supreme essence remains unknown, what is known is trivial while the supreme extreme remains unknown—these are all cases of those who do not know what is known.\n\nAlready enslaved to trifles, already entangled by things, yet they daily sink into the domain of sorrow and exhaustion. What sickness is greater? How could those who seek detachment prescribe remedies to rid them of the eight flaws and four afflictions, so they may naturally attain the tranquil realm of Taiqing?\n\nOnly by recognizing sickness as sickness can one truly be free from sickness.\n\n**Huizong’s annotation:** To know one’s own foolishness is not great foolishness. To know one’s own confusion is not great confusion. Great confusion lasts a lifetime without resolution, and great foolishness lasts a lifetime without enlightenment.\n\n**Cushui commentary:** Foolishness is ignorance without wisdom; confusion is doubt without clarity—both are ailments of nature. These ailments align with Confucius’ statement that the people have three afflictions.\n\nOnly by knowing this and discerning it can one resolve the obscurations and dispel the confusions. Zhuangzi said: *To know one’s own foolishness is not great foolishness; to know one’s own confusion is not great confusion*—this is why.\n\nIndeed, to know one’s foolishness, to know one’s confusion—this is the sick speaking of their sickness. Not great foolishness, not great confusion—this is the sick recognizing their sickness, yet still not sick.\n\n「If one fails to recognize their own foolishness yet still insists on applying it, or if they harbor two doubts and thus fall into confusion, then they shall remain a lifetime without enlightenment or resolution.\n\nThis is like the man from Nanrong and Yue, who knew their ailments yet could not endure the potent medicine of the Dao/Way—thus they wished only to hear the *Sutras of Longevity* (衛生之經).\n\nYet if one treats the disease that afflicts them, then they shall not be afflicted by it themselves. The Sage’s freedom from disease lies in their treating the disease—hence, they are not afflicted.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The Sage is naturally pure (素逝) and shuns worldly involvement (耻通於事), yet they establish the fundamental principles (立本) and comprehend divine unity (通於神)—this is true knowledge. Yet they always appear as though they do not know, and so they are not afflicted.\n\n**Cushui commentary:** *Naturally pure* (素) means untainted by the mundane; *pure and unconstrained* (逝) means they do not fail to traverse all things. Only by being naturally pure and unconstrained can one shun worldly involvement (不蕲通於事), yet all worldly matters become transparent to them (事無不通). This is because they have established the fundamental principles of the Dao/Way (立之本原), and so their wisdom unites with the divine (知通於神).\n\nFor the fundamental principles (本原) are the essence of the Dao/Way. Only by first establishing the great Dao/Way can one merge with the divine—then, with broad vision and seated contemplation, they perceive all things without obstruction, possessing true knowledge. Yet they always appear as though they do not know, and so who could possibly weary their hearts?\n\nZhuangzi said that the man who is naturally pure and unconstrained, yet shuns worldly involvement, and who establishes the fundamental principles while comprehending divine unity, is a man of *Kingly Virtue/Power* (王德之人)—this is why.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two of *The People Do Not Fear the Great Menace* (民不畏威):**\nWhen the people do not fear the great menace, then the great menace has indeed arrived.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The petty man regards minor vices as harmless and does not abandon them; thus, the vices accumulate and cannot be concealed. The *Yijing* (《易》) states: *Bearing a burden and losing one’s ears—disaster.* (荷校灭耳，凶)\n\n**Cushui commentary:** Good deeds that do not accumulate are insufficient to establish one’s reputation; evil deeds that do not accumulate are insufficient to destroy one’s life. Yet the people are born with thick ignorance (民生厚), and their inclinations shift with external influences (因物有迁). They abandon truth for illusion (舍真逐妄), delight in superficial ornamentation (外悦纷华), and engage in conflict over paths of gain and loss (交战於利害之涂) while remaining oblivious to fear. They regard minor good deeds as useless and do not perform them, and minor vices as harmless and do not abandon them. Thus, their evils accumulate beyond concealment (恶积而不可揜), and their crimes grow vast beyond absolution (罪大而不可解).\n\nThis is what Zhuangzi meant by *those who suffer external punishments at night* (宵人之罹外刑), and what the *Yijing* meant by *bearing a burden and losing one’s ears—disaster.* (荷校灭耳，凶)\n\nDoes not their pursuit of gain and avoidance of loss reveal that they do not fear the great menace? (迹其所为得，非不畏其威致然耶？)\n\nDo not narrow their dwellings,」\n\n「Do not narrow their dwelling,」\n---\n\n**Huizong’s annotation:** Dwelling is the abode of one’s nature; human nature is boundless and cannot be confined, yet those of narrow understanding cannot be spoken to of the Dao/Way because they restrict their dwelling.\n\nIf expanded and filled, it will overflow to fill Heaven and Earth, embrace the six extremes, and nothing will be able to contain it. Mencius said: *Dwell in the broadest dwelling of the world.* The *cushui* commentary states: In the boundless expanse of the Great Peace, it fills Heaven and Earth without limit to its boundaries, circulates through the six voids without end to its traces, so that the abode of one’s nature is vast and cannot be confined—its grandeur is boundless.\n\nThose in the world who are ignorant, confined by their own narrowness, see only things and not the Dao/Way. They dig through walls and plant weeds, and their dwelling begins to narrow—because those of narrow understanding cannot be spoken to of the Dao/Way.\n\nIf one seeks its vastness and fluidity to restore the nature’s original state, there must be those who act with resolve to open the way. Then obstacles will be overcome, blockages will be cleared, and if expanded and filled, it will rise to the heights and spread to the depths, covering all beneath Heaven and embracing the six extremes. Its dwelling will be the broadest, yet never will it be confined or petty.\n\nThis is what Mencius meant by *dwelling in the broadest dwelling of the world*—it is also because they do not narrow their dwelling.\n\nZhuangzi said: *The fenced enclosures of the Bowei, the orchards of the Yellow Emperor, the palaces of the Yu, and the halls of Tang and Wu.* Truly, the Dao/Way descends ever lower, and thus their dwelling becomes ever narrower.\n\n**Do not weary of what they produce.**\nHuizong’s annotation: Production is the gathering of *qi*; human life aligns with the transformations of all things, yet those who weary of their production say: *The deeds of a single day can lead to death or loss.* The reversals of this fate mean that the *qi* of night is insufficient to sustain them. Those who preserve the Great Harmony and avoid untimely death do so because they do not weary of what they produce.\n\nThe *cushui* commentary states: Human life is a mingling of coarse and refined, changing to form *qi*, *qi* changing to form shape, shape changing to form life—so life is but a fleeting gathering of *qi*. All who receive the *qi* of yin and yang to form their shape: at night, they rest with yin; within, they interweave with things. By day, they move with yang; without, they engage with things. Human life is inherently aligned with the Dao/Way of day and night and the transformations of all things.\n\nThus, when interweaving with things, all thoughts cease and turn inward; when engaging with things, all threads arise and respond fluidly. If one does not know how to preserve life to defend oneself, but instead exhausts oneself in myriad ways, it is as Mencius said: *The deeds of a single day can lead to death or loss.*\n\nThe reversals of fate are not uniform; even if the *qi* of night is insufficient to sustain them, their failure to preserve a good heart is rare indeed. Only those who guard pure *qi*, nourishing it with uprightness and without harm, will find that the Great Harmony of Heaven and Earth is enough to preserve them—keeping them from scattering, keeping them from departing.\n\nThus can they preserve life and fulfill their years, never meeting untimely death. Is it not because they do not weary of what they produce that this is achieved?\n\nIt is only because they do not weary that they do not weary. Huizong’s annotation: Misfortune and fortune come from no other source than one’s own actions.\n\nThe *cushui* commentary states: Honor and disgrace arrive as reflections of one’s *virtue/power*. Misfortune and fortune have no fixed gate—only human actions summon them. Thus, the rewards for good and evil, calamity and blessing, follow their kind. There is none who does not reap what they themselves have sown.\n\nThen, if the refined *qi* of the Five Phases is attuned, and the spirit is prepared to receive all things, those endowed with nature’s original *virtue/power* who seek to avoid wearied production must truly not weary of their own life.\n\nIn ancient times, a farmer who tended crops recklessly plowed too deeply and hoed too harshly, and thus his crops suffered accordingly. But when he plowed deeply and harrowed carefully, his crops flourished and grew. Who would say that cultivating the body and refining the heart is not like the farmer’s lesson?\n\nThose who cultivate life well should understand this. Hence, the Sage knows themselves but does not display themselves, cherishes themselves but does not exalt themselves—so they abandon that and take this.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: The Sage has clarity in self-knowledge, yet does not parade their abilities; they have benevolence in self-cherishing, yet do not lord over others. Such beings act in the world without harming it, and the world cannot harm them.\n\nThey delight in the Dao/Way of Heaven and have no sorrow—what is there to fear in the threats of anger?\n\nThe Sage’s choices in abandoning and taking are now clear.\n\nThe *cushui* commentary states: Self-knowledge is clarity; the Sage has clarity in self-knowledge. Though their insight extends without limit, how could they parade themselves to boast of their abilities? Only by not parading themselves to boast of their abilities does one attain the height of wisdom. Those who parade themselves do not understand.\n\nSelf-cherishing is the utmost of benevolence; the Sage cherishes themselves with benevolence. Though they widely bestow and aid all, how could they exalt themselves to belittle others? Only by not exalting themselves over others does one attain the height of love. Those who exalt themselves are, in truth, belittled by others.\n\nWith this, they govern the multitude and thus can settle the world in peace, stability, and great harmony. Acting in the world without harming it, the world cannot harm them.\n\nIt is fitting that they delight in the Dao/Way of Heaven to preserve the world, yet fear no threats of anger.\n\nThe Sage’s choices in abandoning and taking—how could they be outside of self-knowledge without display and self-cherishing without exaltation?\n\n---\n**Boldly daring but not daring is death; boldly daring but not daring is life.**\nHuizong’s annotation: The rigid and strong are doomed to destruction. The yielding and weak are preserved in life. Those who boldly dare are capable only of daring. Capable of daring yet unable to retreat is not true virtue—it is merely enough to destroy their body. Hence, Zilu loved daring, and Confucius said he was unfit for any purpose.\n\nThose who boldly dare yet do not dare know how to hold back. To hold back is the Dao/Way of acting first.\n\nLiezi said: *\"There exists an eternal Dao/Way of victory in the world—it is called Softness.\"*\n\n**Exegesis:** The rigid perishes; the sharp is blunted. The strong and unyielding are doomed to destruction. Softness overcomes hardness; weakness overcomes strength. Thus, the soft and weak are preserved in life.\n\nYet the world’s people know only to dare boldly, advancing resolutely without regard—never realizing that supreme softness can traverse the world’s greatest hardness. This is the Dao/Way’s true function: enduring and ever-present.\n\nZilu, though he wandered at the Sage’s gate, did not grasp the Dao/Way’s use. He could not restrain his reckless strength—daring yet unable to retreat—so where could he find true worth? It was enough only to destroy his body.\n\nBut those who know to embrace the雄 (heroic) while guarding the雌 (receptive) are not incapable of daring. Rather, they dwell in softness and stillness, yielding with things like a serpent’s coils, returning to the innocence of an infant. This is the daring of *not daring*—and thus, life.\n\nThus did Guangchengzi abide in harmony, refining his body for a thousand two hundred years without decay—precisely because he dared not dare.\n\nThe *Transmission* says: *\"To act last is to act first.\"* To dare not dare is to know the Dao/Way of holding back. To hold back is to act first.\n\nOnly those who know the eternal Dao/Way of victory in softness can be spoken to thus. Hence, Liezi said: *\"There exists an eternal Dao/Way of victory in the world—it is called Softness.\"*\n\nThese two paths—daring and not daring—bring either benefit or harm.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** Where there is rectitude, there is deviation. Where there is obstruction, there is suitability.\n\n**Exegesis:** What humans call \"arriving at the Dao\" is inversion; what the Dao calls \"arriving at humans\" is inversion. Those who dare boldly may seem to gain, but Heaven truly harms them. Those who dare not dare may seem to suffer, but Heaven truly benefits them.\n\nFor the principles of the world, where there is rectitude, there is deviation; where there is obstruction, there is suitability. They alternate and transform, waxing and waning naturally. Knowing these two paths makes the logic of benefit and harm clearly manifest.\n\nWhat does Heaven abhor? Who knows its reason?\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** The strange in humans aligns with the companion in Heaven. What benefits humans, Heaven abhors—who can know this?\n\n**Exegesis:** Humans have long been overcome by Heaven. Those blinded by human ways, thinking to conquer Heaven, act recklessly in ignorance. How could birds, strange to humans, align with Heaven?\n\nThus, Heaven’s petty ones are humanity’s virtuous; Heaven’s virtuous are humanity’s petty—this is the natural order. Hence, even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** Those who follow Heaven endure; those who defy it perish—even the Sage dares not alter this.\n\n**Exegesis:** To follow is auspicious; to defy is ominous. Thus, those who follow endure; those who defy perish. To know human actions, one must know Heaven’s actions.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"To act in accordance with it—is that difficult? Those who find it easy, Heaven does not favor.\"*\n\nThe Sage aligns with Heaven, harmonizing with the divine to assist in transformation and nurturing. Though seemingly without difficulty, even the Sage does not dare to alter much—what of those beneath?\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven does not contend yet achieves victory.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** When things emerge, Heaven allows them to emerge without resistance. When things return, Heaven allows them to return without obstruction—this is called *not contending*.\n\nTo fill and empty, to wax and wane—Heaven participates with all things, yet all things receive their mandate from it. This is called *not contending yet achieving victory*.\n\n**Exegesis:** Heaven’s movement knows no accumulation, and thus all things are completed. Only through movement without accumulation can it govern all things, transforming from non-being to being. The sun warms and nourishes all, so when things emerge, Heaven allows them to emerge without resistance. The yin consolidates, and all things are perfected, so when things return to their roots, Heaven allows them to return without obstruction.\n\nAs sovereign and regulator, it oversees myriad transformations, standing independently in the realm of non-contention. It sees the ebb and flow—one full, one empty—simply following the natural course of *qi*.\n\nMoreover, though myriad things exist, none escape its pivot. Thus, all receive their mandate here, and what surpasses this as the Dao/Way of victory?\n\nIt speaks not, yet responds perfectly.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** What does Heaven say? It changes with thunder and wind, demonstrating with calamity and blessing—no deviation, only resonant response.\n\n**Exegesis:** The thunder and wind stir all things. Heaven’s blessings reward the virtuous; its punishments befall the licentious. Heaven’s vastness cannot be rushed—its transformations are subtle, operating silently in the boundless void, embodying supreme beauty without speech.\n\nIts means of change: perhaps the thunder stirs, the wind disperses—always in accordance with the season. Its means of instruction: perhaps it blesses the virtuous, punishes the licentious—always in accordance with their kind.\n\nYet its responses are swift, with no deviation—like shadows following form, echoes following sound. It never favors its responses. What does Heaven say?\n\nIt does not summon, yet they come.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** Those who receive their mandate can summon them. The chaos of myriad things is governed by Heaven’s decree—who can summon them? It simply follows the unceasing flow of *qi*.\n\n**Exegesis:** The *Qian* (Creative) is sovereign, the first to emerge among all things; it is father, the origin of all. Ministers receive their mandate from the sovereign; children obey their father—thus, those who issue the mandate can summon them.\n\nOnly by issuing the mandate can one govern all things, commanding all movement.\n\n「All living things, in their myriad confusion, exist within an incalculable expanse—none can be summoned by any means. Unable to summon, yet they come; unable to compel, yet they arrive. Endlessly circulating without pause, they move through the boundless void, their transformations subtle and imperceptible, their **Dao/Way** unceasing, as **qi** flows naturally of its own accord, knowing not whence it springs yet simply is. Tranquil yet shrewd in counsel.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** Virtue and power are always easy to discern, yet perilous to grasp. Tranquility is ease; shrewd counsel is knowing peril. The **Qian** (Creative) accumulates three **yang** to form its substance—this is called **ultimate health**. Though perilous, if virtue and power remain easy, even the **yin**’s dangers cannot ensnare them. Does the *I Ching* not speak in *The Upper Appendices* of **Qian** knowing through ease, and in the *Qian* hexagram’s ninth line, of discerning the emergence of a single **yin**—then using it to bring about auspiciousness? Is this not the meaning of tranquil yet shrewd in counsel?\n\nThe **Heavenly Net** is vast and sweeping, though its mesh is wide yet never misses. **Huizong’s Annotation:** Though dense, it has gaps—this is human action. Heaven, though sparse, has no gaps. Accumulated virtue brings blessings; accumulated vice brings calamities—each responds in kind, thus nothing is ever lost. Yet those who strive only to win, who speak only to be answered, are human. Heaven does not strive yet wins effortlessly, does not speak yet responds perfectly—when summoned, it comes. Only the foolish fail to grasp Heaven’s **Dao/Way**.\n\nHeaven does not summon yet they come; tranquil yet shrewd in counsel—only the **sage** can embody this. Thus, they do not pursue self-interest nor obstruct harm, always benefiting without causing harm, aligning with Heaven’s **virtue/power** and differing from those who dare boldly. **Exegesis:** Heaven follows **principle** (*li*); humans follow **emotion** (*qing*). Following emotion means favoring personal views—though meticulous, they lack comprehensive insight, hence the gaps. Following principle means upholding universal harmony—though sparse, they cannot be evaded, hence no gaps. Thus, though dense with gaps, this is human action. Accumulated virtue must bring blessings; accumulated vice must bring calamities—each befalls its kind, never failing. Is the **Heavenly Net** then deliberate in this? Its judgments on misfortune and fortune arise from inherent causes, all self-inflicted.\n\nThe world’s people are blinded by partiality, ignorant of great **principle** (*li*), chasing trifles while forgetting the root—each path they tread brings new woes. Yet they fail to see that the **Dao/Way** of Heaven is clear and evident, always favoring the virtuous, while the wicked have no place to hide from its scrutiny. Moreover, to know Heaven’s actions and human actions is supreme. Striving only to win, speaking only to be answered, summoning only to bring about—these are all human. When humans cannot align with Heaven, they are but petty and self-serving. If you rid people of this petty wisdom, they will return to **principle**—how could Heaven’s **Dao/Way** be unaligned with humanity? How could humanity be unaligned with Heaven? Only the **sage** can embody this: turning countless petty defeats into grand victory, like Heaven’s effortless triumph; practicing the **Dao/Way** of silent teaching, like Heaven’s perfect response without words; acting in accordance with **principle** yet moving naturally, coming without being summoned, like Heaven’s spontaneous arrival; serene and unassuming, their spirit like divination—tranquil yet shrewd in counsel. If the **sage** does not act, misfortune and fortune do not arise—who then brings disaster? Thus, they do not pursue self-interest nor obstruct harm, always benefiting without causing harm. This passage begins with those who dare boldly—human—and ends with the **Heavenly Net**’s vast yet flawless judgment—divine. The **sage**’s alignment with Heaven’s **virtue/power** is fundamentally distinct from the bold daring of common folk. This is why the passage begins and ends as it does—to illuminate all under Heaven and for posterity. Scholars should ponder this deeply.\n\n**The People’s Common Disregard for Death (Chapter 74)**\nThe people do not commonly fear the **sword and saw** (execution’s tools), nor death itself—how can you frighten them with death?\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** The people have natural hearts, finding life joyous. If they lack this natural heart, why should they fear death? The **sword and saw** restrain them; the **measuring line and weights** (law’s strictures) kill them; the **mallet and chisel** (punitive tools) strike them—this is called frightening them with death. The people will only resist and never reform.\n\n**Exegesis:** From birth, the people are not inherently distinct—**Heaven** bestows upon them a pure spirit, a simple nature. They are the most refined of all creatures, the noblest of Heaven and Earth. Who does not delight in life and abhor death? Water, unobstructed yet easily swayed by external things, lacks constancy of heart. If they lack this natural heart, they will flout laws and evade prohibitions, doing whatever they please—until they fall into crime, whereupon punishment follows. Thus, these are people who do not fear death yet are frightened by it.\n\nOnly when the **sage** cultivates the virtue of cherishing life deeply in the hearts of the people will they know to rejoice in their own lives, naturally moving toward goodness and away from crime—thus avoiding conflict with officials and rendering punishments obsolete. Yet there are those restrained by the **sword and saw**, killed by the **measuring line and weights**, struck by the **mallet and chisel**, who resist yet never reform—are these not the same? If you make the people constantly fear death, and those who act strangely, I shall seize and execute them—who would dare? **Huizong’s Annotation:** All under Heaven take joy in life yet weigh heavily the crime of breaking laws. Only then will strange words be punished, eccentric deeds prohibited—if your crimes against governance are indeed grave.\n\n**Exegesis:** Once the people delight in life, nothing they desire is greater than life itself, nor do they abhor anything more than death—while breaking laws is the heaviest crime. Thus, the people each safeguard their natural inclinations toward life and death: words must have substance, so strange utterances cease, knowing they will be punished; actions must conform to **principle**, so eccentric deeds are rare, knowing they are forbidden. If you seize and execute them, the state will have enduring laws—seeking those who resist, I know none would dare. Indeed, if your crimes against governance are grave, this is precisely the intent.»\n\n「If there is a fixed official to execute, let the fixed official execute. But if a substitute official executes, this is like a substitute carpenter wielding the axe.\n\n**Huizong’s annotation:** The ruler must act without personal interference while the people act in accordance with the ruler’s will—this is an unchanging **Dao/Way**. If a substitute official executes, or a substitute carpenter wields the axe, this means the ruler and the people share the same **virtue/power**, reversing the **Dao/Way** and speaking contrary to it. How could such a ruler govern others if he himself is governed? King Wen of Zhou did not meddle in the myriad words, myriad legal cases, or myriad precautions, but only sought the proper officials to shepherd the people—this is why he succeeded.\n\n**Exegesis:** The ruler follows the **Dao/Way**, the ministers handle affairs. Those who follow the **Dao/Way** act without interference and are honored, thus they serve the ruler’s will. Those who handle affairs act with purpose and bear burdens, thus they serve the **Dao/Way** for the people. The distinction between ruler and minister is an unchanging **Dao/Way**. Only when each has fixed responsibilities that cannot be altered does the legal official execute, the carpenter wield the axe, and the ruler merely maintain his own decorum and face south. Those who engage in affairs of governance never cross the boundary to inquire further—if the ministers act, the ruler must also act, then it is the substitute official executing, the substitute carpenter wielding the axe, and the ruler and ministers sharing the same **virtue/power**. How could such a ruler govern others? Thus, when speaking contrary to the **Dao/Way** and meeting it with falsehoods, he is one who others govern. The **sage’s** governance is without interference yet the world’s affairs are accomplished—this is the essential key to attaining governance. To know the **Dao/Way** is to act without interference, to have no affairs of one’s own, and yet the world serves its purpose.\n\nTherefore, King Wen could settle the worthy and appoint them, ensuring they had no meddling in myriad words, myriad legal cases, or myriad precautions, but only in securing proper officials to shepherd the people did he see urgency—then it is clear that he had no substitutes to fear. Indeed, a substitute carpenter wielding the axe would rarely fail to harm his hands. **Huizong’s annotation:** If a substitute takes on new tasks without exemption from injury, how much more so when substituting for execution? This is why the ancients valued the **Dao/Way** of non-interference. Non-interference means the ministers bear full responsibility.\n\n「The *Commentary on the Daoist Classic of Virtue and Power* states:\n\n*\"To grasp the great **symbol/principle** (大象, *dàxiàng*), the world follows; when it follows without harm, there is peace and ease. The **Dao/Way** of the Sage in governing the world lies in attending to affairs of **non-interference** (無為, *wúwéi*), and practicing instruction without words. Thus, the Sage could place the world in a state of peace and ease, and how could there be any harm from a substitute’s axe?\n\nIn *The Answer to the King* of *Zhuangzi*, it is said: *'The **Dao/Way** of non-interference means full responsibility for affairs.'* This is the **Dao/Way** of non-interference where those entrusted with duties bear full responsibility.\n\nIt is fitting that at the end of the chapter, it states: *'The **Perfect One’s** (至人, *zhìrén*) use of the heart is like a mirror—neither pushing nor pulling, responding without hoarding. Thus, the **Perfect One** can overcome things without harming oneself.'*\n\n**Chapter 75 of the *Commentary on the Daoist Classic of Virtue and Power* (卷十三結):**\n*\"The people’s hunger arises from the excessive taxes of their superiors—this is why they starve.\"*\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** *\"When taxes are heavy, fields and crops are prone to neglect, and the people lack sufficient food.\"*\n\nThe *Commentary* states:\n*\"Mencius said: 'Transform their fields, reduce their taxes, and the people can be made rich; feed them according to season, use them with propriety, and wealth will be inexhaustible.' The Sage’s governance of the world ensures that the people can hold food to their chins and play, drum their bellies and stroll, saying that they enjoy sustenance and that the people are well-fed throughout the year. This is not merely achieved by lightening the taxes to nourish the people, but also by guiding them to abandon trivial pursuits and return to the fundamental **Dao/Way** (本, *běn*).\n\nIndeed, **virtue/power** (德, *dé*) lies in benevolent governance, and governance exists to enrich the people. In ancient times, those who understood this would survey the twelve regions of soil to discern their suitability, then teach the people the appropriate cultivation methods for each. They would assign land responsibilities, establish tribute systems, and reward those who succeeded in their tasks with the honor of *鄙師* (lowly teacher), while punishing those who failed with the blame of *載師* (burdened teacher). Thus, the people would all exert themselves in their fields, take joy in their work, and strive for success—so the common folk would not suffer from hunger.\n\nAt that time, they relished their food, admired their attire, unaware of the **Imperial Dao/Way’s** (帝力, *dìlì*) influence upon them. How could there be any calamity of neglected fields and insufficient food?\n\nThe people are difficult to govern because their superiors meddle in affairs—this is why they are difficult to govern.\"*\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** *\"When governance is burdensome, deceit and fraud proliferate, and the people lose their simplicity.\"*\n\nThe *Commentary* states:\n*\"The Sage relies on the **Dao/Way** in the world and governs through affairs. Though responding to the myriad things, the Sage remains rooted in the **Dao/Way’s** essence of non-interference. Even in the application of rewards and punishments, the Sage does not depart from the fundamental principle of *渊虚* (profound emptiness, *yuānxū*). Loving tranquility, the people naturally align; without burdensome affairs, the people naturally thrive; without desires, the people naturally remain simple. This is so because the Sage depends on **Dao/Way** transformation rather than clever schemes. Relying on **Dao/Way** transformation means governance is not burdensome; not depending on clever schemes means deceit and fraud cease, and the people return to their simplicity.\n\nThe *Classic* says: *'When governance is obscure and gentle, its people are pure and honest; when governance is scrutinizing and strict, its people are weary and corrupt.'* When governance is burdensome, deceit and fraud arise, and the people lose their simplicity—this is the meaning of *'governance is scrutinizing and strict, its people are weary and corrupt.'*\n\nPeople’s disregard for death arises from the depth of their attachment to life—this is why they lightly view death.\"*\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** *\"When life is cherished too deeply, the pursuit of gain becomes fervent, leading to reckless and licentious behavior, with no bounds.\"*\n\nThe *Commentary* states:\n*\"Life is what I desire, but there are things I desire more than life—this is why I would not obtain it at any cost. Death is what I abhor, but there are things I abhor more than death—this is why some misfortunes I would not avoid.\n\nThe people of the world do not understand this: they cling to what is weighty and discard what is light, thus excessively valuing life while neglecting righteousness. Those who would gain any advantage at all cost do so without restraint.\n\nBecause of their deep attachment to life, the people’s pursuit of gain is relentless—contending for fish, they are willing to get wet; chasing beasts, they are willing to run. To the point of losing their natural balance, they indulge in reckless and licentious behavior, doing whatever they please. Even when facing perilous risks, they regard death lightly. Though life is cherished too deeply, this very attachment leads to its destruction.\n\nOnly those who do not make life their primary concern are wiser than those who overly value it.\"*\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** *\"Zhuangzi said: 'Those who comprehend the essence of life do not labor for what life cannot provide.'*\n*Those who do not make life their primary concern do not labor for what life cannot provide*—this is abandoning affairs while relinquishing life.\n\nAbandoning affairs means the body is not taxed; relinquishing life means the essence is not depleted. When the body remains whole and the essence is restored, one aligns with the **Dao/Way** and becomes one with Heaven—this is why such individuals are wiser than those who overly value life. Though valuing life is different from regarding death lightly, abandoning life is even wiser than valuing it.\n\nExtending the principles that benefit my own life to the people, we see lightened taxes, simplified punishments, households with sufficient provisions, and people well-clothed. Yet the people do not transgress, and this is the ultimate achievement of the **Imperial Dao/Way** (帝王, *dìwáng*).\"*\n\nThe *Commentary* states:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** is fundamentally empty of things; your body is also empty. Even in the matters that concern your very existence, nothing is more vital than life—yet life is not truly yours to possess, for it is the **Heavenly Harmony** (天地之委和, *tiāndì zhī wěihé*) entrusted to you. Only by not claiming life as your own can you preserve it entirely. Thus, those who comprehend the essence of life—how could they labor for what life cannot provide?\n\nAlas, the people of the world believe that nourishing the body is sufficient to sustain life, yet nourishing the body ultimately fails to preserve life. They do not realize that without burdens, one remains balanced and upright; when balanced and upright, corrupt **qi** cannot assail, and **Heavenly Harmony** will naturally arrive, blending with their own vitality. Thus, they attain a renewed life.\n\nWithout burdens, one does not make life their primary concern; not making life their primary concern means they do not labor for what life cannot provide. This allows one to abandon affairs while relinquishing life.\n\nAbandoning affairs means the body is not taxed yet remains whole; relinquishing life means the essence is not depleted yet restored. When the body is whole and the essence is restored, **virtue/power** (德, *dé*) returns to its original state, and one aligns with the **Dao/Way**, becoming one with Heaven—this is why such individuals are wiser than those who overly value life. Though valuing life is different from regarding death lightly, abandoning life is even wiser than valuing it.\"*\n\nThe **Sage** examines the means by which we nurture our life, and when applied to the people of the world, they bring about abundant governance and thriving populace. Light taxes and levies are seen, and clear laws bring the people into submission. Harsh punishments are avoided, yet families are well-provided and people are content—those above have what they need, those below have what they nurture—so the people naturally incline toward the realm of **virtue/power** (仁寿, *rénshòu*). Needles and saws are not employed, axes and chisels are not used, clothing and headgear are simply adorned, and garments are distinguished—yet the people do not transgress.\n\nThus, nobles and commoners fulfill their roles, and the **virtue/power** (德, *dé*) of the wise and the unworthy aligns with their nature. The Sage achieves the **Dao/Way** of great peace, and its brilliance matches the winds of the ancient times.\n\nExamining its source, one understands the principle of **non-action** (无为, *wúwéi*). The means by which we nurture our life is merely to apply it to the people.\n\nThus, the people have enough food and do not starve, return to simplicity and are not difficult to govern, and value life without regarding death lightly—this is the ultimate achievement of the **Emperor-King** (帝王, *dìwáng*), is it not?\n\n**Human life spans seventy-six years.**\nHuman beings are born soft and weak, yet in death they become hard and strong.\nGrasses and trees are born soft and brittle, yet in death they become withered and decayed.\n\nThus, those who are hard and strong are the followers of death, while those who are soft and weak are the followers of life.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** All things bear the yin and embrace the yang, blending their **qi** (冲气, *chōngqì*) to achieve harmony. The yang’s **virtue/power** (德, *dé*) lies in its ability to generate life, while the yin’s function is to bring about austerity and destruction.\n\nWhen the yin’s austerity prevails, the harmony of blending is lost.\nHence, it is said: the hard and strong are the followers of death, while the soft and weak are the followers of life.\n\n**Explanatory notes:** *Lǐzǐ* states: The transformations of yin and yang are called life and death.\n\nAll things flourish within Heaven and Earth, adorned by the strange pairings of yin and yang, confined by motion and stillness. None fail to bear the yin and embrace the yang, blending their **qi** (冲气, *chōngqì*) to achieve harmony.\n\nSpeaking of life and death, the yang **qi** is ever effusive, generating life as its **virtue/power** (德, *dé*), and all things thereby unfold and thrive—so the soft become hard, the weak become strong. The yin **qi** is ever congealed, bringing about austerity and destruction, and all things thereby wither and decay—so the hard are ruined, the sharp are blunted. As the **qi** subtly shifts, reaching the point of austerity and destruction, the harmony of blending is lost and returns to the utmost stillness.\n\nThose who serve the yin and yang in the world know that life and death alternate, yet they do not grasp the constant **Dao/Way** of victory: softness (柔, *róu*), nor the constant **Dao/Way** of defeat: hardness (刚, *gāng*). Thus, they abandon the principle of life and move toward the realm of death.\n\nFor the **Dao/Way** is the interplay of one yin and one yang; all things follow it.\n\nIn terms of **affairs** (计事, *jìshì*), hardness and strength suffice to overcome softness and weakness. Yet in terms of the **Dao/Way**, softness and weakness suffice to overcome hardness and strength—this is why hardness and strength are the followers of death, while softness and weakness are the followers of life.\n\nHence, when armies are strong, they do not prevail.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** When opposing armies clash, the pitiful will triumph.\n\n**Explanatory notes:** The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is but the end of **virtue/power** (德, *dé*).\n\nThe **Sage** mobilizes **spirit-qi** (精神, *jīngshén*), moves the **heart-methods** (动心术, *dòngxīnshù*), and focuses on the **root** (本, *běn*), from which the **branches** (末, *mò*) follow. Thus, Heaven’s awe is manifest, and the **spirit-martial** (神武, *shénwǔ*) does not resort to killing. This is seen in the **Sage**’s benevolence extending across the world, and righteousness inspiring awe throughout the world. Such an approach is indeed sufficient to uphold the **root** (大定功, *dàdìnggōng*) of great peace, to settle the people and harmonize the multitude, and to attain the constant **Dao/Way** of victory. How could one ever prioritize the strength of armies?\n\nTherefore, those who assist the **Sovereign** (人主, *rénzhǔ*) with the **Dao/Way** do not rely on making armies strong throughout the world.\n\nYet when opposing armies clash, the pitiful triumph—this is because they hold victory well.\n\nWhen wood is strong, it is split.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The sturdy branches of *gōngbǎ* (拱把) mulberry and *zǐ* (梓) trees—people all know to cultivate them, yet when they become strong, they are cut down and split.\n\n**Explanatory notes:** The *Shijing* says: *\"The chairs are made of mulberry and zǐ wood.\"*\n\nIndeed, mulberry and zǐ wood are gentle and refined materials, fit for ceremonial and musical use. When they first grow, they are but small branches, and people, if they wish to cultivate them, all know to nurture them because of their softness and weakness.\n\nYet when they rest day and night and are nourished by rain and dew, and can serve as the beams of halls or as tools and implements, then they are cut down and split—because of their hardness and strength.\n\nLooking at plants, even they are felled first when strong, so how can one doubt that hardness and strength are the followers of death?\n\nThus, hardness and strength occupy the lower position, while softness and weakness occupy the higher.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The victory of softness over hardness, and of weakness over strength, is the **Dao/Way** and **art** (道术, *dàoshù*) of the **Master Lao**.\n\n*Zhuāngzǐ* says: *\"To display meekness and weakness, and to practice humility and submission.\"*\n\n**Explanatory notes:** Softness is the **Dao/Way**’s hardness, so the constant **Dao/Way** of victory lies in softness. Weakness is the **Dao/Way**’s strength, so the constant **Dao/Way** of defeat lies in hardness.\n\nFor softness accumulates into hardness, and the accumulation occurs first.\nWeakness accumulates into strength, and the formation occurs later.\n\nThe first is above, the latter is below. Hardness and strength are naturally above, while softness and weakness are naturally below.\n\nObserving this in Heaven and Earth, Heaven accumulates **qi** (气, *qì*), fulfilling its role in generating life and occupying the upper position—its accumulation is not hardness and strength. Earth accumulates masses (块, *kuài*), fulfilling its role in bearing form and occupying the lower position—its accumulation is not softness and weakness.\n\nObserving this in the principles of things, water’s nature is to follow: if directed east, it flows east; if directed west, it flows west. Yet in attacking hardness and strength, it cannot overcome them. Wind, when it points at me, overcomes me; when it blows against me, it also overcomes me. Yet it alone can break down great trees—this is because it accumulates the unyielding force of countless small victories into a great victory.\n\nThus, the victor is above, and the vanquished are below.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** and **art** (道术, *dàoshù*) of **Master Lao** are often found in this principle: hardness leads to ruin, sharpness leads to blunting. Hence, one knows to be male yet preserve the female, to be bright yet embrace the dark. While others always take the lead, the Sage alone takes the rear, never leading yet always following others. This can be called attaining the constant **Dao/Way** of victory.\n\nObserving his writings, the discussions on softness overcoming hardness are numerous: some say \"preserve softness,\" others say \"attain softness,\" yet again, \"do not dare to seize strength.\" Furthermore, \"the overbearing will not attain their death,\" and in this passage, the principle of strength and weakness is elaborately expounded.\n\nZhuangzi said that to display meekness and humility as a facade is not the Dao/Way of dwelling below. Once, Confucius, when questioned by Zilu, spoke of strength and said, *\"Be broad and gentle in teaching, but do not answer the unrighteous strength of the southern lands.\"* Could this too be the Dao/Way of preserving softness?\n\nWho says that Master Lao’s teachings and Confucius’ Dao do not align?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seventh: The Dao/Way of Heaven**\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?\n\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised; the overabundant are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: The Dao/Way knows no gain or loss, but things have fullness and emptiness. It is poured into yet never overflows, measured yet never exhausted—this is what the Sage preserves.\n\nWhen descending into things, Heaven and Earth fill and empty with the times, waxing and waning. How much more so for humanity?\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven attains perfection in balance, thus lowering the high so they do not exceed, raising the low so they do not fall short. Those who are about to come are advanced, those who have succeeded are withdrawn. The four seasons run their course, each in its proper order.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: The Dao/Way in the world is vast, encompassing all boundaries, yet subtle, penetrating to the core. Its use fills the six voids, yet when abandoned, none know its whereabouts—what gain or loss is there? When descending from the Dao/Way, it is confined by things, bound by *qi*, and transformed by *qi*’s fluctuations; it adheres to numbers and is governed by them. One fullness, one emptiness—none can escape this.\n\nOnly the Dao/Way transcends *qi* and numbers, becoming the mystery of all things. Thus, those with *qi* and numbers all draw from it without depletion. Hence, it is poured into yet never overflows; though added to, it does not increase. It is measured yet never exhausted; though diminished, it is not diminished further. The more it gives to others, the more one retains; the more it bestows, the more one possesses. This is what the Sage preserves—what humanity cannot abandon.\n\nMoreover, within the realm, vast as Heaven and Earth are, when the Dipper shifts south, all things flourish; when it shifts north, all things wither. It wanes as it wanes, flourishes as it flourishes—sometimes waning, sometimes flourishing, moving with the times. Even the Dipper’s single star in the void cannot escape *qi* and numbers.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth fill and empty, waxing and waning with the times. How much more so for humanity? Therefore, rise and decline succeed one another, completion and ruin follow in turn—this is the unalterable principle of nature.\n\nOnly the Dao/Way of Heaven follows reason and balance, thus nothing exists that does not attain the mean. If mountains are steep and barren while marshes grow fat, if waters recede from depths while trees wither their branches, if those who gnaw with teeth lose their horns, if those who flap with wings lose their feet—\n\nThe high fear their arrogance and are lowered to bend and conform, not exceeding to the point of excess. The low fear their meanness and are raised to stand and reach, not falling short. Those who are about to rise are advanced, those who have succeeded withdraw, like the four seasons: spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow. They shift without lingering, each in its proper order, all tending toward the mean.\n\nObserve the Dao/Way of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain—this is the Dao/Way of time.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: The *Yijing* says: *\"The Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes fullness and supplements humility.\"* Those who are full are diminished—this is diminishing the excessive. Those who are humble are supplemented—this is supplementing the deficient. To diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient is to balance through transformation.\n\nThe *Shujing* says: *\"Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain—this is the Dao/Way of time.\"* Could this be what is meant?\n\nBut the Dao/Way of humanity is not so. It diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: Human hearts push down the low and elevate the high, oppressing the solitary and fearing the eminent.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: What arises naturally is the Dao/Way of Heaven. What is forced is the Dao/Way of humanity. The two are vastly distant.\n\nSince the Dao/Way of humanity is burdened by artificiality, human hearts are ever precarious, never at ease. The low are pushed further down, the high are raised further up, chasing after things in deference and subservience, lacking steadfast principle. Thus, they oppress the solitary and fear the eminent.\n\nThe solitary are pitiful—if they are oppressed, none encourage them to cultivate virtue and do good. Who will take their side? The eminent are contemptible—if they are feared, none punish them for deceit and wickedness. Who will restrain them? This is merely diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive—how could they know the natural Dao/Way of Heaven?\n\nWho among humanity can diminish the excessive and serve the deficient in the world? Only the Dao/Way.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: It does not oppress the solitary, yet the impoverished receive from it. It does not fear the eminent, yet the wealthy are diminished by it. Only those with the Dao/Way can do this.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: The solitary are rejected and oppressed by the many. If one loves virtue, even if they are solitary and honored, they will be advanced and not oppressed—this is the impoverished receiving from it. The eminent are emulated and feared by the many. If one does not love virtue, even if they are eminent and high, they will be punished and diminished—this is the wealthy being taken from. Truly, this is the Dao/Way.\n\nThe Dao/Way acts impartially, neither favoring one nor neglecting another. It universally responds, fittingly addressing all, balancing the unbalanced to attain balance. The Sage embodies this to govern the world—who would suffer from partiality and deceit?\n\nThus, to diminish the excessive and serve the deficient is not to align with the Dao/Way of Heaven. Who can achieve this?\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"The Master is the Dao/Way of Heaven.\"* Therefore, the Sage acts without relying on it, accomplishes without claiming it—does this not mean they do not desire to be seen as virtuous?\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: They do not rely on their actions, so they have no pride in self-praise.\n\nThe Sage does not dwell on their accomplishments, hence they have no pride of self-satisfaction. While others adorn their intelligence, they alone appear as if foolish; while others seek victory, they alone yield and preserve themselves—all to avoid being seen as virtuous. Thus, they are always without loss, attaining the Dao/Way of Heaven.\n\n**Exegesis says:** Within the utmost emptiness, transformation gives rise to all things. The Sage embodies this utmost emptiness to fulfill all desires—how could they rely on their actions?\n\nThey harmonize all things without claiming righteousness, bestow benefits upon all ages without claiming benevolence—who would have pride in self-praise? The birds called *zhì* (至) and *qù* (去) do this—how could they dwell on their accomplishments?\n\nThough their achievements cover the world, they seem not to be their own; they abandon merit and fame, returning them to the people—who would have pride of self-satisfaction? This is what is meant by the \"spirit-person without merit.\"\n\nAbandoning cleverness and artifice, they follow the natural principles of Heaven. The virtuous person’s excellence is such that their appearance seems foolish—this is what is meant by *\"while others adorn their intelligence, they alone appear as if foolish.\"*\n\nThey conform and adapt with things, blending like waves, accumulating countless small defeats into great victory—this is what is meant by *\"while others seek victory, they alone yield and preserve themselves.\"* All this is because they do not desire to be seen as virtuous.\n\nDid the Master of the Five Chariots (列御寇) reject the gift of five jars of wine because of this principle?\n\nBecause they do not desire to be seen as virtuous, they remain humble and gain benefit while always remaining without loss—this is how they attain the Dao/Way of Heaven.\n\nCompared to those who adorn their intelligence, startle the foolish, refine their conduct, and reveal their purity—brightly shining like the sun and moon in their actions—who cannot avoid blame, the difference is vast.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Soft and Weak Conquer the World**\n\nNothing in the world is softer and weaker than water, yet nothing can surpass it in attacking the firm and strong—this is because nothing can replace it.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The *Yijing* uses a well to symbolize nature, saying it does not change. Laozi says water is nearly the Dao/Way, because nothing can replace it.\n\nIf something could replace it, it would submit to others and lose itself—how could it conquer things? Only when nothing can replace it does it remain constant amid ten thousand changes, and nothing can conquer it.\n\n**Exegesis says:** Water flows from the earth, passing through everywhere without obstruction; when dug, it becomes a well. The Dao/Way exists throughout the world, and when obtained, it becomes nature—thus, the *Yijing* uses a well to symbolize nature.\n\nA well, when maintained, is never exhausted; though cities change, the well remains unchanged—this is because nature is constant, unaffected by nobility or lowliness, wisdom or foolishness. Though events vary without constancy, their essence does not change, just as a well does.\n\nHeaven generates water from the One, and it is not far from the Dao/Way. It benefits all things, and all things receive its blessings and grace, yet it always remains in a state of softness, weakness, and non-contention. Among all things in the world, nothing can replace it—thus Laozi says water is nearly the Dao/Way, because nothing can replace it.\n\nIf things could replace it, then it would submit to others and lose its own nature—how could it attain the constant Dao/Way and conquer things? Only when nothing can replace it does it adapt to the terrain, becoming crooked or straight, and to the vessel, becoming square or round. Though it undergoes countless variations, it remains ever constant—truly, nothing can conquer it.\n\nThat the soft conquers the hard, the weak conquers the strong—this is known by all under Heaven, yet none can practice it.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** Though they know it, benevolence cannot guard it.\n\n**Exegesis says:** Intelligence is used to exhaust principles; benevolence is used to fulfill nature. The affairs of the world are not difficult to understand, but difficult to practice. If intelligence is sufficient to exhaust principles but benevolence is insufficient to fulfill nature, then they weary of what they uphold and lack sincere perseverance—how could they practice it?\n\nThe soft conquering the hard, the weak conquering the strong—common people may have sufficient intelligence to know it, but they often fail because they do not firmly cultivate it. Though they know it, benevolence cannot guard it; even if they attain it, they will lose it—what benefit would this have?\n\nThe Classic says: *\"My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice, yet none under Heaven can know them, none can practice them.\"* This is in agreement.\n\nThe Sage thus speaks: *\"To bear a state’s defilements is called the sovereign of the ancestral altars; to bear a state’s misfortunes is called the king of all under Heaven.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Rivers and marshes receive filth, mountains and thickets harbor disease; a ruler contains defilements, embodying the Dao’s emptiness, and thus what he receives is ever broader, becoming the refuge of all things, while his governance extends ever farther.\"*\n\nThe Classic says: *\"To know its glory and endure its humiliation is to be the valley of all under Heaven.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *\"Water begins as a single ladle, yet accumulates to form rivers; thus the Yangtze and Yellow River gather waters to become vast. Earth begins as a single clod, yet accumulates to form fields; thus hills and mountains rise from lowly heaps to become lofty. When good deeds accumulate to form virtue, the divine clarity is naturally attained; the Sage’s heart flows accordingly, and so the great person harmonizes all to become the public good. What the *Classic of Transmission* says—‘Rivers and marshes receive filth, mountains and thickets harbor disease, a ruler contains defilements’—is precisely this.\n\nThough a ruler’s undertakings may bring prosperity, his ascent to kingship is marked by the burden of what others flee. Hence, a king’s virtue lies in his capacity to receive. To be the king of all under Heaven, one must hold fullness without excess, preserve completion without loss—this is why one must bear the state’s misfortunes. This aligns with the Classic’s saying: *‘What people detest are solitude, widowhood, and barrenness, yet the king and duke take them as their calling.’*\n\nTo bear a state’s defilements and its misfortunes alike is to view honor and humiliation as one, without the heart of clinging or rejecting. In essence, it is only emptiness that can receive—hence the *Dao De Jing* says: *‘To know its glory and endure its humiliation is to be the valley of all under Heaven.’* This is the ultimate rectitude.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Words are not confined to one meaning; what seems contrary to things is in harmony with the Dao—this is called the ultimate rectitude of all under Heaven.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *\"How can the Dao exist without words, or words exist without the Dao? One and words are two; two and one become three. From this point onward, even the most cunning cannot grasp it—thus words are not confined to one meaning. Yet, when the ultimate words are spoken, the common words prevail, giving rise to debates like ‘Firm and White’ [over differing interpretations], where people are bewildered and do not know where to turn. Then all under Heaven begins to see ‘rectitude’ as contrary to things.\n\nOnly those who understand the resolution of words—though they seem contrary to things, yet harmonize with the Dao—can speak all day and exhaust the Dao. What could be more ultimate than this rectitude? This is what Zhuangzi meant when he said, *‘Parables are the true words.’*\"\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine: Harmonizing Great Grievances**\n\n*\"To harmonize great grievances\"* must leave lingering resentment—how then can it be called ‘good’?\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Those who seek revenge do not break the spear; even those with vengeful hearts do not resent the windblown tile. Thus there is no lingering resentment.\"*\n\n*\"To love people is the root of harming them. To lay down arms is the root of creating them—how then can it be called ‘good’?\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *\"The spear has no intent to harm, so those who seek revenge do not break it. The windblown tile has no intent to harm, so those with resentful hearts do not resent it. If one is always a judge or executioner, then people’s encounters with them are like the spear or the windblown tile—hence, all under Heaven is balanced, and there is no lingering resentment.\n\nMoreover, benevolence loves people, so it hates those who harm them. Righteousness follows principle, so it hates those who disrupt order. If one uses cleverness to win favor, this is benevolence—yet it is the root of harming people. If one prohibits attacks and puts weapons to rest, this is laying down arms—yet it is the root of creating them. How then can harmonizing great grievances be truly good?\n\nThus the Sage holds only the left contract, and does not demand accountability from people.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The Sage follows great transformation without obstruction, receiving and rejoicing in it—hence no demand for accountability from people, nor do people demand it of him. Contracts have left and right, distinguishing giving and taking. To hold the left contract is to give alone.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *\"The Sage empties himself to traverse the world; though myriad appearances are diverse, his heart remains ever clear. Though myriad transformations differ, his heart remains ever still, responding naturally to all under Heaven’s ways. He simply follows this moment, and in emptiness and tranquility, there is nothing to obstruct or muddy. This is what Zhuangzi said: *‘To follow great transformation without obstruction.’*\n\nThus he can float in response, intoxicated by the flow, never rejecting people or severing things, yet suddenly standing in the realm of no affairs. To act without action, to govern without governance, to treat things without harming them—while things cannot harm him—is why he holds only the left contract and does not demand accountability from people, nor do people demand it of him.\n\nIn ancient times, governance was achieved by knotted cords; later sages replaced them with written contracts. Officials used them for administration, and the people used them for clarity. Yet contracts have left and right: the left for giving, the right for taking. To hold only the left contract is to engage in nothing but giving. Though he gives without demanding accountability from people, things come naturally, without needing to be coerced or trusted.\n\nThus there is one with virtue who oversees the contracts.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"To distribute with virtue is called sage.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *\"Virtue in people is shared universally; it cannot be monopolized. The Sage adjusts and responds to it, his virtue extending broadly. Since his heart is naturally shared with all, he simply returns to distributing it—then people’s alignment with the contracts is naturally effortless.\"*\n\n「Zhuangzi records Guanzi’s words as saying: *\"To distribute virtue among the people is called sage.\"* This is precisely what was meant.\n\nMoreover, Master Kong also said: *\"The noble person purifies his words and aligns with the universal—then there is harmony; he refines his speech and conforms with the natural—then there is response.\"* His intent is the same.\n\nBut one without virtue cannot oversee the contracts.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"He who finds pleasure in universal harmony is not a Sage.\"*\n\nOne without virtue does not find his own fulfillment, yet he seeks the fulfillment of others. While he strives to make all things harmonize, he harbors both conciliatory and resentful emotions. This is the root of obstruction—what is called *蔽* [obstructed/blinded].\n\nZhuangzi says: *\"Those who lose themselves in things are called the obstructed and blinded people.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *\"The measure of things is boundless, yet he exhausts himself in seeking their harmony. His wisdom is strained, his spirit cannot keep pace—how could he not be constrained? The Sage transcends fixed knowledge and precedent, follows the natural Dao of Heaven, and aligns with the spontaneous flow of things without private favor. He responds only when moved, always out of necessity, not delight. How could he take pleasure in forcing harmony upon all?\n\nThose who are blind to this cannot establish deep roots through virtue nor set firm boundaries with moderation. They chase after things and forget their own path, failing to find their own fulfillment yet seeking that of others. They labor endlessly, striving only for universal harmony, while harboring both conciliatory and resentful emotions—this is the very essence of obstruction, the *蔽蒙* [blinded and deluded]. Thus, when Zhuangzi says, *'He who finds pleasure in universal harmony is not a Sage,'* is he not correct?\n\nFor obstruction means he cannot see clearly, and delusion means he lacks understanding. Burdened by things and hindered, who could truly diminish substance for harmony or attain emptiness for clarity?\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has no favorites—it always aligns with the good. The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"If one is good, then Heaven aids him—what favoritism is there?\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *\"Heaven follows natural principles—what is near or distant? Heaven has no partiality—what does it give or take? Though it does not relax in giving or taking, its response is based on things, and it aids only the good.\"*\n\nFor the wisdom of Heaven originates from the wisdom of the people. The good follow their own path, and the people follow them—thus it is fitting that Heaven always aids the good.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: *\"Do good and Heaven will bestow a hundred blessings.\"* It also says: *\"The August Heaven has no favorites—it aids only those with virtue.\"*\n\nFor when accumulated goodness forms virtue, Heaven has reason to aid them. This passage speaks of holding the left contract and ultimately aligning with the Dao of Heaven, to show how the Sage’s Way harmonizes with Heaven’s.\n\nThis is why the poem in *Dongzhuo* [洞酌] says, *'The August Heaven favors those with virtue and nourishes those who follow the Way.'*\n\nFrom the *Small States, Few People* chapter, verse eighty:\n\n*\"Small states, few people...\"*\n\nHuizong’s annotation states: *\"When lands are vast and populations numerous, governance cannot keep pace with demands, wisdom cannot discern all matters, and virtue declines while punishments arise—thus the chaos of later ages begins here.\"* Laozi, at the end of the Zhou, weary of its disorder, sought the original Dao and embedded this intent in his text, aiming to counter the excesses of ornate culture and restore simplicity. Hence, he spoke of *\"small states, few people.\"*\n\nIndeed, in the age of supreme virtue—from Róngchéng to Shénnóng, with twelve sovereigns renowned for perfect governance—this was their very essence.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains:\n*\"Under Heaven’s vast expanse, all is the king’s land; within its borders, all are the king’s subjects.\"* Yet why, despite such boundless territory, does Laozi advocate for small states and sparse populations? For when lands expand and people multiply, cunning and deceit flourish, tasks proliferate beyond governance, and wisdom, clouded by artifice, fails to discern truth. Moral decay and licentiousness ensue, offenses multiply, and transgressions defy prohibition—thus the root of later disorder.\n\nLaozi, pitying the decay of contemporary customs, traced the origins of virtue and illuminated profound truths. Through his text, he sought to dismantle the superficial and restore the pure simplicity of antiquity, consolidating scattered elements into unity and stripping away ornamentation to reveal substance. Thus, he spoke of *\"small states, few people.\"*\n\nFrom Róngchéng, Dàtíng, to Fúxī, and Shénnóng—twelve sovereigns celebrated for perfect governance—also governed by ensuring the people lacked knowledge and desire. In harmony with ignorance, their virtue remained untainted; in harmony with desirelessness, they embodied pristine simplicity. Such was the age of perfect order.\n\nLaozi’s teachings aimed to return the people to this primordial state, hence his emphasis on this principle. He sought to render the people’s abundant tools useless:\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Unity without factionalism, free from the burdens of crowds.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary elaborates:\n*\"The people possess innate nature—weaving cloth for garments, tilling fields for sustenance—this is called shared virtue. Since their virtue aligns, they need no external comparisons, and self-sustenance suffices. This is unity without factionalism.\"*\n\nUnity lies in shared nature, while factionalism arises from unnecessary comparisons. When united yet uncompared, they dissolve into the boundless, and the people, until death, do not interact. Even with abundant tools, they find no use for them—how much less the burden of crowds?\n\nThus, the Sage detests crowds, for crowds breed factionalism. Shun, though thrice relocating to Chengdu, settled at Deng’s ruins with ten thousand households, yet his joy in governance knew no end. When crowds gathered, he welcomed them—Shun could not refuse. Yet such responses were but responses to dust and dross, the remnants of imperial affairs. To wield the world yet remain detached, achieving effortless governance—who but the most divine could do so?\n\nHe made death precious, so the people did not flee.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Life brings them joy, death offers burial—thus the people do not lightly abandon their land.\"*\n\nConfucius said: *\"When the ruler loses the Way, the people scatter—long has this been so.\"* Is this not the meaning of fleeing?\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains:\n*\"The people’s greatest concern is to live and die without regret. If life brings joy—honoring parents and nurturing offspring with provision—if death offers burial—garments, coffins, and grave goods are assured—then where is the delight in life or the sorrow in death? How could they lightly abandon their land for distant shores?\"*\n\nIn Zhou’s heyday, the six provisions sustained the people, ensuring the poor were relieved, and the six customs secured them, guaranteeing ancestral burial. Five clans aided in mutual assistance, four neighborhoods shared funeral rites. Plowing together in fields, dwelling in shared quarters, laboring in common enterprises, defending against shared harms—thus the people did not lightly abandon their land. How much more so in a virtuous realm, where the people are simple and unspoiled, private desires few, and cravings scarce! With no paths through mountains, no bridges across marshes, how could they lightly abandon their land for distant shores?\n\nYet gathering them posed no difficulty: love them, and they grow close; benefit them, and they assemble. Govern through what they hate, and they disperse. The reason ancient peoples valued life and did not flee was that their rulers upheld the Way, loving and benefiting them.\n\nConfucius said: *\"When the ruler loses the Way, the people scatter—long has this been so.\"* Thus, if the people do not flee, it is because the Way is upheld. Though chariots and arms exist, they serve no purpose.\n\nHuizong’s annotation states: *\"Mountains without paths or tunnels, marshes without boats or bridges—this is akin to the people having no knowledge, yet their virtue remains unbroken. Without traces of perilous obstacles, even if chariots and boats exist, they serve no purpose to ride upon; without signs of warfare, even if arms and armor are present, they serve no purpose to deploy.\"*\n\nThe *Shu yi* commentary explains: *\"Beyond natural inclinations, there is nothing but material things. When these things become one’s companions, then external pursuits become one’s primary concern. Cravings and calculations multiply, and the people wander and flee without end. If one seeks to draw them far away, then mountains must be carved with paths and tunnels to make passage possible; if one seeks to traverse difficulties, then marshes must be bridged with boats and ferries to be navigated. Even if one wishes to rest and leave no trace, it cannot be achieved. Only in an age of supreme virtue do the people return to their original nature: mountains lack paths or tunnels, marshes lack boats or bridges, yet they do not travel between one another. Their ignorance is like that of infants—dwelling without knowing what to do, moving without knowing where to go. Simple and tranquil, they leave no record of perilous obstacles, so even if chariots and boats exist, they serve no purpose to ride upon. Forgetting distinctions and judgments, they know no signs of warfare, so even if arms and armor are present, they serve no purpose to deploy. Thus, each finds contentment in their natural endowments alone.*\n\n*If one were to restore the use of knotted cords for governance, Huizong’s annotation says: *\"It is merely a record of essentials, requiring no written contracts.\"* The *Shu yi* commentary elaborates: *\"The governance of the world must have some means to preserve and transmit enduring clarity for future generations. Thus, in the upper antiquity, knotted cords were used to rule, while later sages replaced them with written contracts, saying that words alone cannot fully record all matters, so they are verified by written texts; deeds alone cannot fully establish trust, so they are supplemented by seals. But when governance reaches its peak of effortless action, when the people are pure and affairs are simple, then bonds need not be enforced with glue or ropes. People act in accordance without needing to be bound by rules—even if knotted cords were used to record essentials, it would suffice to win the trust of the world. Why then require the meticulous detail of written contracts and seals to prevent deceit among the people? Thus, restoring the use of knotted cords is to return the people to the age of primordial simplicity.*\n\n*They find their food sweet, their clothing fine, their customs settled, and their occupations joyful. Huizong’s annotation explains: *\"They till the fields to eat, weave to clothe themselves, carry food in their mouths while playing, and drum their bellies in leisure—these are the people’s natural capacities. They are content with their portion, so their food is sweet; they reject ornamentation, so their clothing is fine; they are undisturbed, so their customs are settled; they preserve life, so their occupations are joyful.\"*\n\n*The *Shu yi* commentary further clarifies: *\"When the people return to their original nature, they abandon superficiality and focus on the essentials, spurning useless labor and valuing only practical matters. Their livelihood depends solely on farming and sericulture. Thus, when they till the fields to eat, the grain is unified under cultivation; when they weave to clothe themselves, the silk is unified under spinning. They rise with the sun and rest with the setting of it, with no need for cleverness or skill—only daily sustenance matters, so they carry food in their mouths while playing. Harm and benefit do not unsettle them; they simply adapt to their own ease, so they drum their bellies in leisure. The people’s essential tasks are fulfilled here, and beyond these four matters—sweet food, fine clothing, settled customs, and joyful occupation—there are no further concerns. Sweet food lies in moderation, not in aversion to eating; fine clothing lies in simplicity, not in adornment. Settled customs come from non-interference, free from reckless action. Joyful occupation lies in self-sufficiency, without covetous desires. Without the people returning to their original nature, how could this state be attained?*\n\n*Even neighboring nations gaze upon one another, and the sounds of chickens and dogs intermingle, yet the people live to old age and death without ever visiting one another. Huizong’s annotation says: *\"Their dwellings are close, their voices heard, yet they do not travel between one another. At that time, there were no cravings or desires, no artificial actions—only constant spontaneity. This is what is called supreme virtue.\"*\n\n*The *Shu yi* commentary elaborates: *\"Their dwellings are close, yet their paths are not marked by interaction. Their voices are heard, yet their places are distant in spirit. It is fitting that they protect and aid one another, share resources and welcome guests. But even when they reach a state of serene forgetfulness, living to old age and death without ever traveling between one another, it is because they do not know the distinctions that govern interaction—thus, there is no interaction at all. Though mountains lack paths and marshes lack bridges, it is so. When their nature returns to simplicity and desire vanishes, their hearts forget material things and seek nothing—only constant spontaneity. What else could this be but supreme virtue?\"*\n\n*Laozi, in the chapter on ‘The Supreme Ultimate,’ says: *\"The people say of me that I am effortless.\"* Indeed, having already spoken of the governance of the Supreme Ultimate as effortless, it is clear that in an age of supreme virtue, the people act without artificial means yet remain constantly spontaneous. There is no doubt of this.\n\n*The chapter on ‘Faithful Words Are Not Beautiful’ (81):*\n*\"Faithful words are not beautiful,*\n\n「The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"When the Dao emerges in speech, it is bland to the point of tastelessness, yet it does not shame even the hundred sages nor decay through the ten thousand ages.\"*\n\n*The Commentary explains: *\"The Dao is not mere words; without words, its profundity cannot be revealed. Words are not the Dao; without the Dao, their foundation cannot be established. When the Dao manifests in words, it is bland yet without taste, rooted in principle and meaning—far beyond the sweetness of coarse grains and the beauty of rich delicacies. It can be practiced to verify truth and examined to resolve doubts. When combined, it aligns like matching seals; when upright, it is easy to follow. Thus, it does not shame even the hundred sages. When firm as metal and stone, it is essential yet easy to uphold. Thus, it endures through the ten thousand ages without flaw. If so, then faithful words grounded in the Dao—what need is there for them to be beautiful? Beautiful words lack faithfulness.\"*\n\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"‘Proper speech’ is ornate; those who indulge in elaborate rhetoric use mere embellishments as their core, thus lacking faithfulness.\"*\n\n*The Commentary explains: *\"Ornate speech lacks substance; what lacks substance is merely empty. Thus, ornate speech is empty, while profound speech is real. Indulging in elaborate rhetoric leads to words that fail to convey truth, using mere embellishments as their core, thus failing to grasp the essence. If such is the case, then the farther one strays from the Dao. Though the end may still be called ‘speech’ and the Dao may be exhausted, it is enough to please those who seek beauty in sound—yet where is the substance to demonstrate faithfulness? Thus, it lacks faithfulness.\"*\n\n*\"The good do not argue,*\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"Speech should emphasize essence and principle.\"*\n\n*The Commentary explains: *\"When one attains completeness, it is called ‘essence’; when all essences converge, it is called ‘principle.’ Speech that upholds essence and principle as its standard achieves the fullness of the Dao and contributes to ultimate truth. When such speech is established, it is always appropriate. Though it does not rely on elaborate argumentation, its profound meaning is fully preserved—enough to satisfy what people desire to hear. This is what is meant by ‘the good do not argue.’ Formerly, Confucius examined the Twelve Classics and said: ‘The essence lies in the Seven Meanings.’ Mencius, who followed Confucius, when pressed for words, said: ‘Do I truly enjoy argumentation?’ His words were: ‘I study extensively and explain in detail, only to return to concise speech.’ Yet Yang Xiong said: ‘The essence of speech is conciseness.’ Is this not the meaning of ‘the good do not argue’? Argumentation is not good.\"*\n\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"Excessive elaboration leads to many digressions, straying from the Dao’s ultimate correctness.\"*\n\n*The Commentary explains: *\"Excessive speech exhausts itself; it is better to uphold the middle. Indeed, the labor of argumentation is like that of a mosquito—far from the Dao’s ultimate correctness. As for Gongsun Long’s sophistry and Hui Shi’s manifold schemes, it is merely the toil of a mosquito. This is why argumentation is not good.\"*\n\n*\"The wise are not learned,*\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"To grasp the subtleties of the Dao, one must return to its simplicity.\"*\n\n*The Commentary explains: *\"The Dao’s simplicity does not complicate; those who know its subtleties understand it in a single word, preserving it in direct perception. A little suffices—why seek learning? The Classic says: ‘What is learned yet unnamed is called subtlety.’ Exploring subtlety reveals its formless, hidden nature. Only when one returns to simplicity and speaks to the extreme can this be known. Zhuangzi says: ‘Knowledge of it is shallow; ignorance of its depth is profound.’ The learned do not know. The Emperor Huizong annotates: ‘What is heard and seen is less valuable than simplicity.’ Zhuangzi says: ‘Learning is not necessary for knowledge; argumentation is not necessary for wisdom.’ The Commentary explains: ‘When studying the Dao, one must daily diminish. The Dao’s formless realm is perceived only by the spirit, its soundless expanse only by the qi. Vision and hearing do not depend on the ears and eyes—why value the multitude of what is heard and seen? The good progressors of the Dao say: ‘Uphold simplicity’ and ‘speak concisely.’ Indeed, ‘it is better to uphold simplicity.’ Laozi, in response to Confucius’ inquiry about the ultimate Dao, also said: ‘The learned do not know; the argumentative are not wise.’ Thus, the subtleties of knowing the Dao are not attained through mere learning and observation—this is clear.\"*\n\n*\"The Sage has no accumulation,*\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"There is accumulation; thus, it is insufficient. There is no hoarding; thus, there is abundance.\"*\n\n*Zhuangzi says: *\"The Dao of the Sage flows without accumulation.\"*\n\n*Confucius says: *\"I thus daily depart.\"*\n\n*The Commentary explains: *\"The Dao’s ultimate emptiness has never contained anything. Things are boundless, all confined within the Dao. The Dao is obscure in its nothingness, thus empty yet responsive; things are stagnant in their existence, yet how much do they differ? Like grass in its growth, it is taken as if it would never end, yet when gathered, it is sometimes exhausted. This is accumulation—thus, it is insufficient. But emptiness without accumulation is different. Like a mirror reflecting forms, all beauty and ugliness are revealed; like a valley echoing sounds, all goodness and evil are answered. This is why there is no hoarding, yet there is abundance. The Sage embodies the Dao’s ultimate emptiness, flowing without accumulation. Six senses and four limbs—there is nothing the Sage is not present in. Responding in time, it is merely the remnants of the Dao, never obstructing reality. Thus, the Sage can manifest in transformation and stand alone in heaven. Zhuangzi, in his discussion of the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of the Emperor, and the Dao of the Sage, all said: ‘It flows without accumulation.’ This is the case. Confucius attained this Dao, reaching boundless freedom and leaving no trace. It was not merely received and preserved—his form did not change until its end. Thus, he said: ‘I thus daily depart.’ Though he has departed, how could he be lost in mere emptiness and stillness, preventing students from entering his gate? He simply does not cling to traces of existence, offering them instead to forget in nothingness. Though he forgets the past ‘I,’ there is an ‘I’ that does not forget. Giving to others, he becomes ever more abundant; sharing with others, he becomes ever more plentiful.\"*\n\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"The good are generous and complete, yet never exhausted. All things borrow from them without depletion.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states: The Dao reaches the utmost non-being, yet fulfills all things’ demands. It is poured into without overflowing, drawn from without exhaustion, and suffices all things without ever being depleted. All things flourishing between Heaven and Earth, their growth and formation—all draw from it without depletion, for it moves yet never accumulates.\n\nThe Sage attains the Dao, yet never hoards it for himself. Giving to others, he becomes ever more abundant; sharing with others, he ever more plentiful. Responding to the myriad needs from the foundation of emptiness and stillness, his embrace is boundless and all-encompassing, taking as needed and always sufficient—how could it not be amply abundant?\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming.\n\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates:* *\"Only the *Qian* [Creative] can benefit all under Heaven with its beauty. Though it does not speak of what it benefits, all things are truly benefited, and there is never any harm.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states: *Qian* is the Dao of Heaven. Great indeed is the primal *Qian*! All things draw their origin from it. Its transformative mechanism subtly shifts within the boundless void—it opens and gives birth, extends and circulates, and through this, all things are formed. All precious treasures flourish in the grand assembly of *Heng* [Abundance] and *Jia* [Auspiciousness], none but the beauty of benefiting all under Heaven.\n\nThe *Odes* sing of abundant harvests, saying: *\"Much millet, much glutinous rice.\"* For millet thrives in high, dry, and cold places, while glutinous rice favors low, moist, and hot conditions. Speaking of them as \"much\" reveals Heaven’s beneficence knows no limits—though it does not name what it benefits, the benefit is inherent.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Heaven and Earth possess great beauty, yet do not speak of their beneficence.\"* How then could there be any harm?\n\nThe Sage’s Dao acts yet does not contend.\n\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates:*\n*\"It follows without opposing; its motion is like water.\nIt responds without hoarding; its stillness is like a mirror.\nIt harmonizes without leading; its response is like an echo.\nThough it acts, its action arises from non-action—it embodies Heaven itself. What contention could there be?\"*\n\nThis virtue aligns with the Dao, hence the *Classic of Virtue* concludes with it.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states: The Sage applies the Dao to all under Heaven, nurturing things according to their nature, aiding their spontaneous unfolding. Thus, it follows without opposing, its motion like water—what is called *\"timely action.\"* Supplying all demands, it effortlessly transforms from non-being to being; responding without hoarding, its stillness is like a *yín* [balance scale]—what is called *\"steadfast stillness.\"* Attending to things’ responses, gentle and still in itself, it harmonizes without initiating—its response is like an echo—what is called *\"preserving the feminine.\"* These three aspects, within oneself without attachment, let things manifest naturally. It is neither non-action nor action, but non-action that encompasses all action.\n\nThough establishing myriad laws, its action stems from non-action. Abandoning cleverness and fixed ways, it follows Heaven’s natural order.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is a single *qi* in motion, all things flourishing in abundance. It acts without effort yet remains ever clear, conquers without contention. The Sage embodies Heaven to govern the world, playing with the Creator—its Dao is subtle yet vast, in motion weaving the myriad realms, in stillness mirroring Heaven and Earth. Universally responsive yet never at odds, thus it acts without contending. This virtue aligns with the Dao, hence the *Classic of Virtue* concludes with it.\n\nLaozi, in concluding the *Classic of Virtue*, speaks of aligning with the Dao, for the Dao in others is called *dao*, while the Dao within is called *de*. Virtue encompasses the unity of the Dao; only when virtue advances beyond the Dao can one speak of its utmost expression. When Dao and virtue reach this state, is not the intent of the *Classic* profound?\n\nI have often reflected: Though the Dao is unspeakable and hidden, it is not as clear as when spoken. Laozi, pitying the excess of rhetoric in his time, sought to restore the purity of Heaven and Earth and the essence of antiquity. To return to the primal simplicity, he composed ninety-nine chapters, elucidating the intent of Dao and virtue to awaken all under Heaven and future generations. He spoke only when necessary, hence in the final passage, he explains his purpose in writing the *Classic*: *\"Faithful words are not ornate; eloquent speakers are not virtuous,\"* urging students to delve beyond the words to grasp their mystery, transcending speech itself.\n\nLike Zhuangzi’s *Book* concluding with the *Heaven Down*, it delves deeply into the origin of the Great Dao, forcefully rejecting the obfuscations of a hundred schools. He himself claimed his writing was \"erratic and absurd,\" loosening the traces of his composition.\n\nExamining the *Zhuzi*, none surpass Zhuangzi in wisdom to comprehend Laozi. Their works complement each other—how could it be merely a matter of verbal artistry?\n\nTracing his critique of the Six Classics, they reduce to the *Odes’* aspirations, the *Documents’* deeds, the *Rites’* practices, the *Music’* harmony, and the *Changes’* yin-yang, along with the *Spring and Autumn’*s distinctions of rank—hardly confined to pedantic commentary. Thus, the truly wise are not merely erudite.\n\nYet when discussing the varied excellences of myriad arts—from Mozi downward to Huishi’s multifarious schemes—his *Five Cartloads* of writings are contradictory and inconsistent, ever more distant from the Dao. This reveals that extensive knowledge without insight is blind.\n\nSpeaking of the Sage’s non-accumulation through emptiness, it is clear that giving to others increases his abundance, sharing with others multiplies his plenty.\n\nObserving the Sage nurture all things and harmonize the world, he must take Heaven as his standard, demonstrating the Dao’s beneficence without harm.\n\nObserving the establishment of the ever-present non-being, it must be expressed through gentle, weak, humble, and lowly conduct, revealing the Sage’s Dao acts without contending.\n\nThough Laozi and Zhuangzi’s words differ, their Dao resonates without explicit agreement. Examining their concluding intent, this is the true grasp. Respectfully submitted.\n\n*The Explanatory Commentary on the Authentic Classic of Dao and Virtue* concludes here, Volume Fourteen.",

      "translated_text": "**Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (Moral Teachings of the *Dao De Jing*)**\n*Title:* **Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (Moral Teachings of the *Dao De Jing*)**\n*By Jiang Cheng (宋江澄)*\n*Fourteen Scrolls*\n*Source Text:* *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), *Dongshen* (洞神) Section, *Yujue* (玉诀) Category\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the *Dao De Jing***\n\nWith reverence, I acknowledge the Sacred Sovereign’s enlightenment, whose teachings illuminate the Dao and the True. In moments of leisure and clarity, he selected *Laozi’s* *Dao De Jing*, elucidating each sentence to bless the world.\n\nAs a subject among the assembled scholars, a student of the Imperial Academy, I purified my mind and, with humility, read the Sovereign’s work. I reflect: no text is more useful than the *Dao De Jing*, yet *Laozi’s* Five Thousand Words are the very essence of Dao and virtue. Though concise, they encompass the vast; though varied, they harmonize. They restore the natural order and govern the present age. Their words are simple, yet their meaning profound—only a Sage could articulate them thus.\n\nSince the Zhou Dynasty, countless scholars have expounded upon it, numbering over a hundred schools, yet most are clouded by their own biases, failing to grasp the True Dao. Their interpretations, though well-intentioned to honor the Sage’s teachings, often contradict them. Only those who deeply enter the Dao and attain divine insight can truly comprehend it.\n\nI reverently observe that the Emperor, taking One as the standard for the world, embracing Unity as the model for all, embodies simplicity and sincerity, extending governance to both humanity and Heaven. The subtleties of the Dao reside inherently in virtue, yet must be spoken and believed, guiding scholars to their rightful path.\n\nThe Sovereign’s learning is profound and complete, like the *Yi Jing* with its *Xici* (系辞), truly the words of a Sage. Yet the Dao, once spoken, cannot be fully perceived by sight or hearing—its application is boundless. How then can I, with limited senses, describe its ineffable depths with finite words? I dare not presume, knowing my understanding falls short.\n\nI have observed how the Emperor’s predecessors, such as the Tang Emperor, composed refined commentaries, and Du Guangting (杜光庭) further expounded with the *Guangsheng Yi* (广圣义). How much less am I, though long instructed, to dare follow in their footsteps? Thus, I humbly offer this commentary, though I know my words are inadequate.\n\n**Jiang Cheng’s Preface**\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* – Scroll One**\n*By Jiang Cheng, Student of the Imperial Academy*\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\n*The Dao* is the shared path of all people.\n*Virtue* is what the heart naturally attains.\n*The Dao* endures through all ages without decay,\nwhile *virtue* fulfills one’s nature and remains constant.\n\nWhen *Laozi* lived in the late Zhou, the Dao declined and virtue waned. Thus, he wrote ninety-nine chapters to illuminate the eternal principles of Dao and virtue, calling it the *Jing* (经). His words are concise, his meaning profound—scholars must meditate deeply to grasp them.\n\n**Jiang Cheng’s Commentary:**\n\nThat all things follow it is called the *Dao*.\nThe *Dao* pervades all existence, yet is not confined—neither the vastness of Heaven and Earth nor the minutiae of an autumn hair escape its embrace. Even within boundaries, nothing exists without it. How much more so for humanity?\n\nMencius said: *\"The Dao is like a great road.\"* Yet the character for *Dao* (道) shares its form with *\"road\"* (道路), for humanity cannot traverse beyond it. Thus, it is clear that the *Dao* is the shared path of all.\n\nThat which the *Dao* embodies within us is called *virtue*.\n*Virtue* in humanity is complete in life and sufficient in allotment. Before form takes shape, it enables existence; it requires no external cultivation nor reliance on others—it is self-derived. What else could it be?\n\nYang Zhu said: *\"Virtue is what one attains.\"* The character for *virtue* (德) derives from *\"straight heart\"* (直心), meaning it is not acquired from others but is self-attained. Thus, *virtue* is what the heart naturally possesses.\n\nMoreover, the *Dao* is boundless while *virtue* is cultivated. Only because the *Dao* is boundless does it remain unchanged through ages, unconstrained by time—ever renewing, never ending. The *Jing* states: *\"The Dao is enduring.\"* This is why it persists through all ages without decay.\n\nOnly because *virtue* is cultivated does it expand the four cardinal virtues, transforming myriad forms without alteration, nurturing and fulfilling them without separation. The *Classics* say: *\"Virtue is the beginning of nature.\"* This is why it perpetually resides within one’s nature.\n\nThe *Dao* has ascents and descents; *virtue* has flourishing and decline. In eras of order, the *Dao* is exalted and *virtue* thrives, while in times of decay, the *Dao* wanes and *virtue* diminishes. By the late Zhou, the Great Dao had faded, and *virtue* further declined, fragmenting into the myriad doctrines of the Hundred Schools, obscured by conflicting theories—neither comprehensive nor pure. Thus, the arts of the *Dao* became divided across the land.\n\n*Laozi*, pitying that the wondrous *Dao* had no successor and that the people remained unaware, took *emptiness* as his principle and *non-action* as his foundation, aligning with the ultimate patterns of nature. He wrote ninety-nine chapters to illuminate the eternal principles of Dao and virtue, so that those who read his words might perceive the completeness of Heaven and Earth and the grand essence of antiquity. This is why his work differs from the Hundred Schools and is called the *Jing*.\n\nFor the *Jing* has a fixed structure, hence it is called *\"constant\"*—like the *Jing* (经) of stars, which adorn the heavens unmoving, or the *Jing* (经) of weaving, which guides the loom without alteration. Thus, it is called the *Jing*.\n\nObserve his work: it encompasses all subtleties, vast and complete, yet contains no more than five thousand words. Its language is concise. One year cannot exhaust its transformations; a lifetime cannot fathom its depths. Its meaning is profound.",

      "translated_text": "The scholar who merely knows the words yet fails to grasp their meaning, or who attains the meaning yet clings to the words, has not truly understood. The *Yǔ* (语, \"Sayings\") states: *\"Silent reflection reveals its essence.\"* Mencius says: *\"The gentleman cultivates deeply through the Dao, seeking to attain understanding on his own.\"* The eternal principles of Dao and virtue cannot be fully captured by mere speech or shallow perception; only through the heart’s intuition and divine comprehension can one transcend the words and their intent, recognizing the unrecognizable and thus drawing from their profound depths. This is the true essence of this book.\n\nThus, the Sage’s composition begins with the first chapter, expounding the marvels of the Dao to awaken the scholar’s mind, offering the instruction to reflect in silence and cultivate deeply.\n\n**Chapter One: The Dao That Can Be Spoken**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\n\nHuizong’s annotation says: *\"The Dao is without beginning; it cannot be spoken of. When spoken of, it is not the true Dao.\"*\n\nAgain, it says: *\"The Dao cannot be named.\"* Yet the Dao that can be spoken of and named—like the unfolding of seasons or the rise and fall of affairs—responds to what is appropriate, waning and waxing in turn, not an unchanging truth. The eternal Dao and eternal Name are self-originating, self-rooted: before Heaven and Earth existed, they were already fixed and enduring from ancient times. The Lord Fu Xi attained this Dao and sat in the *Shǎoguǎng* (少广, \"Minor Expansion\"). No one knows its beginning, no one knows its end.\n\nThe *Shūyì* (疏义, \"Explanatory Notes\") say: *\"What can be spoken of are the coarse aspects of things.\"* The utmost subtlety of the Dao is far removed from such things, hence it cannot be spoken of.\n\nWhen Confucius saw Wen Bo Xue (温伯雪), his gaze struck and the Dao was preserved—this is why. Zhuangzi recorded the words of the Dao’s beginning: *\"The Dao cannot be spoken of; when spoken of, it is not the true Dao.\"* Is this what is meant?\n\nAt the dawn of creation, there was *wu* (无, \"non-being\") and *you* (有, \"being\"). Non-being had no name; when things formed and their numbers were fixed, then names and perceptions arose. The Dao is not confined by things nor trapped by numbers—when viewed, it cannot be seen. Who could name it? This is what Zhuangzi called *\"the great Dao does not affirm itself.\"*\n\nAgain, it says: *\"The Dao cannot be named.\"* Is this what is meant?\n\nIndeed, the principles of the world have what is *ke* (可, \"affirmable\") yet also what is *buke* (不可, \"unaffirmable\"). When form takes shape, there is what cannot yet be affirmed, and when the pattern emerges, it is both affirmable and unaffirmable, affirmable yet unaffirmable. Things have no fixed appropriateness, affairs no fixed wrongness; the waxing and waning of all things, the flourishing and decline of seasons—spring and summer first, autumn and winter last—each season’s rise and fall, hidden yet manifest, manifest yet hidden, formed then destroyed, destroyed then formed, what was once true now false, what was once discordant now harmonious—all follow the fittingness of the time. When the Dao that can be spoken of and named responds to what is appropriate, waning and waxing in turn, it is not the true eternal Dao.\n\nAlthough names and realities exist, they belong to things; what can be spoken of and perceived grows ever more distant when spoken of. Though the Dao cannot be spoken of, there remains a Dao that is not spoken of; though the Name cannot be named, there remains a Name that is not named. The Dao that is not spoken of is called the *constant Dao*; the Name that is not named is called the *constant Name*.\n\nThe meaning of \"constant\" lies in its enduring completion without change, its permanence through time. The Dao as constant is spoken of in the *Jing*: *\"It stands alone, unaltered.\"* The Name as constant is spoken of in the *Jing*: *\"From ancient times to the present, its name does not fade.\"* Yet things that arise must have their origins and roots, whereas the constant Dao and constant Name have no origins or roots. Things arise from Heaven and Earth, but the constant Dao and constant Name precede Heaven and Earth in their birth.\n\nThough *qi* (气) gathers and scatters, this Dao has no departure or arrival; though forms emerge and perish, this Dao has no existence or annihilation. *\"Self-originating, self-rooted: before Heaven and Earth existed, it was already fixed and enduring from ancient times.\"* Those who attain this Dao ascend to supreme sovereignty, which is why Fu Xi attained it and inherited the *Qi Mu* (气母, \"Mother of Qi\").\n\nThe *Qi Mu* is the origin of *qi*, the primordial source from which all *qi* arises. Attaining it allows one to wander within the *Tai Chu* (太初, \"Supreme Beginning\"), as the *Jing* says: *\"Having known its children, one must then guard its mother.\"* This is the way to eternal life, which is why the Western Sovereign Mother sits in the *Shǎoguǎng*, her beginning unknown, her end unknown.\n\nFor the Dao has no head at its start, no tail at its end. Those who embody the Dao—who could trace its origin? Who could limit its conclusion? The *Jing* says: *\"Having obtained its mother, one knows its children.\"* The Dao is nameless at its beginning, yet it is the mother of Heaven and Earth; the named is the mother of all things.\n\nHuizong’s annotation says: *\"The Dao is ever nameless, yet Heaven and Earth depend upon it to arise—this is what Zhuangzi called 'generating Heaven and generating Earth.'\"*\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth existed, who could name it? Thus, the nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. With Heaven and Earth, all things then arise, so the named is the mother of all things.\n\nThe *Shūyì* say: *\"The Dao’s utmost subtlety cannot be sought through wisdom nor found through form—though one desires to name it, it cannot be attained.\"* The Dao’s name is a borrowed designation; calling it the Dao is merely a forced naming. This is the Dao hidden within the nameless.\n\n*\"The Dao is ever nameless\"*—this is what is meant. The *Yijing* (易) states: *\"The Great Polarity (太极) gives rise to the Two Principles (两仪).\"* Heaven and Earth are the greatest of formed things, yet formed things arise from the formless. How then do Heaven and Earth arise? It is from the Dao alone, *\"the mother of all beneath the heavens.\"* This is what Zhuangzi called *\"generating Heaven and generating Earth.\"*\n\nThe nameless has no reality—it exists in the void of things. When things coalesce in indistinct unity, before Heaven and Earth arise, it is still void. Thus, before Heaven and Earth existed, who could name it? Though Heaven and Earth are the parents of all things, all things depend upon them to arise. The world has a beginning; calling it the mother of the world means Heaven and Earth depend upon the Dao to manifest.",

Thus, it is called the *Jing*.\n\nObserve his work: it encompasses all subtleties, vast and complete, yet contains no more than five thousand words. Its language is concise. One year cannot exhaust its transformations; a lifetime cannot fathom its depths. Its meaning is profound.",

      "translated_text": "All things draw their origin from the Great Primordium (*Buqian* 乾元), yet though their source is vast, they still rely upon it to flourish. All things draw their life from the Supreme Receptivity (*Kunyuan* 坤元), yet though their foundation is profound, they still depend upon it to manifest. When we trace what sustains the singular thread of the One, what substance is it? It is but the Dao alone. This is why it is said, *\"Only after Heaven and Earth arise do all things come into being.\"* This is the Dao made manifest in named existence.\n\nThe Dao is singular in essence. When gathered, it forms substance; when dispersed, it marks the beginning. From its original source, it remains hidden in the Nameless—this is called the Beginning. From its manifestation, it appears in the Named—this is called the Mother. Though the terms differ, their root is one.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth mark the Beginning, today’s scholars recognize this. If one truly perceives the Dao, then even before Heaven and Earth existed, their origin could be known. This is how the Sage knows Heaven and Earth’s Beginning *after* their existence.\n\nTo observe its subtlety, one must remain in the Constant Void;\nTo grasp its breadth, one must embrace the Constant Manifest.\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: Zhuangzi said, *\"Establish it in the Constant Void.\"* To erect nothing is the Constant Void. To discard nothing is the Constant Manifest. The Constant Void lies in principle—its upper reaches are unfathomable, the essence of all beneath the heavens, hence its subtlety is observed. The Constant Manifest lies in affairs—its lower reaches are boundless, the transformation of all beneath the heavens, hence its breadth is grasped.\n\nThe realms of Having and Not-Having intertwine, where subtlety and breadth reside. Great wisdom unites both perspectives, leaving nothing unattainable. In the hazy and indistinct, there are forms and things. Small wisdom clings to one-sidedness, blinded by partiality, abandoning the Manifest for the Void, or the Void for the Manifest, neglecting the root for the branches—thus the Dao is fractured for all beneath the heavens.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: Without motion, there is generation of the Manifest—this is its utility. When the Manifest reaches its limit, it returns to the Void—this is its function. The Manifest does not depart from the Void, so the Void is not truly Void. The Void does not abandon the Manifest, so the Manifest is not truly Manifest. To establish it in the Constant Void is to affirm the Void that is not Void. To establish it in the Constant Manifest is to affirm the Manifest that is not Manifest. Though transformations are boundless, their foundation remains unchanging—this is why it is called Constant.\n\nZhuangzi expounds Laozi’s teachings: *\"Establish it in the Constant Void.\"* Yet his text begins with this very principle, deeply grasping the logic of Having and Not-Having. Thus, when purifying away all things, even sage wisdom, righteousness, and propriety would be discarded—this is the Constant Void. When establishing all laws, even affairs, forms, and names would be preserved—this is the Constant Manifest. The Constant Void in principle has never given rise to things; hidden and difficult to know, even divine vision cannot perceive its form. Hence, its upper reaches are unfathomable, revealing the small yet subtle—entering the divine through its minuteness, thus becoming the essence of all beneath the heavens. The Constant Manifest in affairs encompasses all virtues; evident and easily seen, it is manifest yet concealed. Hence, its lower reaches are not obscured, revealing the great yet broad—emerging from clarity and vastness, thus becoming the transformation of all beneath the heavens.\n\nConfucius composed the *Yijing*. When about to act or move, he spoke of nothing finer than the essence of all beneath the heavens—this is because from the Void to the Manifest, principle dictates so. In the arrangement of trigrams and their transformations, he spoke of nothing broader than the transformation of all beneath the heavens—this is because gathering the Manifest into the Void, affairs dictate so.\n\nThe Constant Void and Constant Manifest arise from the same source; the utmost subtlety and transformation stem from the same divine origin. Though their names differ, their principle is one.\n\nThough Having and Not-Having are unified, their utility and application shift—\nIn the Manifest, they are concealed; in the Void, they are revealed.\nCalled subtle, called wondrous—merely their dwelling place.\n\nOnly great wisdom, viewing near and far, knows that the root of the Manifest is not truly Manifest—\nThose who cling to it as Manifest still harbor the Void within.\nKnows that the Void is not truly Void—\nThose who reject it as Void still contain the Manifest.\n\nIn the hazy and indistinct, forms are visible;\nIn the indistinct and hazy, things coalesce indistinctly.\n\nThe obscure interplay of Having and Not-Having—\nWhen observed through the Dao, all is exhausted,\nAnd the whole becomes one, leaving nothing unattainable.\n\nCommon folk, bound by small wisdom, are blind to the great principle.\nSome, obscured by the Dao’s stillness, discard the Manifest for the Void,\nDrowning in seclusion, taking the non-Void as Void;\nSome, lost in the Dao’s motion, cling to superficiality,\nNeglecting the root for the branches, entangled in forms,\nTaking the non-Manifest as Manifest;\nOr making nothingness the way, fixated on one aspect—\nA hundred schools, each boasting their strengths.\nThus the Dao is fractured for all beneath the heavens.\n\nThese two—though differing in name, they share the same origin—\nBoth are called the Mysterious.\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: The Dao is formless—\nWho can grasp its breadth and subtlety?\nThings and self share the same root;\nRight and wrong arise from the same *qi*—\nThus they are both called the Mysterious.\n\nThe deluded of the world seek falsehood for truth,\nMoving farther from truth, unaware that\nHaving and Not-Having are but differing names.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: The true origin is singular and complete,\nWithout form yet encompassing all—\nThe form of the formless, exhausting the boundless.\nOnly breadth and subtlety are indistinct, without division.\nThus the Dao is formless—\nWho can grasp its breadth and subtlety?\n\nFrom the Dao descending, distinctions arise.\nThe ignorant, clinging to self and objects, give rise to the illusion of self and other.\nThis is that, and that is this—\nYet from the indistinct emergence of *qi*, *qi* is singular.\nThus, things and self share the same root;\nRight and wrong arise from the same *qi*—\nConverging all differences into one origin—\nWho is truly Having, who truly Not-Having?",

*xuan*.\nSmall and subtle—this is *xuan*,\nBecause it enters and becomes small.\n\nIf we speak of *xuan* virtue—\nIt is virtue entering and becoming small.\nIf we speak of *xuan* darkness—\nIt is entering into darkness and becoming small.\nThough *xuan* is small, it remains subtle,\nYet it has not yet departed from color—\nAs the *Yijing* says: \"Heaven is *xuan*, Earth is yellow,\"\nAnd Zhuangzi says: \"The *xuan* sky.\"\nThus, *xuan* as color has red and black—\nRed for *yang*, black for *yin*.\nAll things bear *yin* and embrace *yang*,\nYet *xuan* can be *yin* and can be *yang*—\nThen what is confined to *yin* and *yang*?\nCan it truly transcend this?\nMuch less *xuan* itself!\n\nWhat constitutes *xuan* is *xuan* again *xuan*—\nAs the *Liezi* [列子] says: \"Coloring.\"\n\nAll things emerge yet their gateway is unseen—\nIt lies here.\n\nAlthough Confucius composed the *Yijing*, only reaching the *Shuogua* to speak of subtlety,\nWhile Laozi placed this at the beginning of his work—\nThe *Yijing*, from exhausting principles to fulfilling nature and destiny,\nIs a sequence of entering the Dao through speech,\nAnd returning function to essence.\nLaozi’s work, with returning to the root and restoring destiny as its priority,\nIs a sudden manifestation of the Dao in action,\nShowing that the numinous arises from essence in function.\nThe *Yijing* uses symbols and numbers, Laozi uses *you* and *wu* to demonstrate *xuan*—\nThough their words differ, they complement each other as beginning and end.\nThough their teachings seem disjointed, their essence is one.\n\n**Chapter Two: All Under Heaven Know**\n\nAll under Heaven know beauty when it is beautiful—then ugliness arises;\nAll know goodness when it is good—then not-goodness arises.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nThe Dao has no differing forms—who is beautiful or ugly?\nNature is inherently unified—who is good or bad?\nThere is beauty, and ugliness is its opposite,\nThus it is said: All under Heaven know beauty when it is beautiful—then ugliness arises.\nThere is goodness, and not-goodness is its opposite,\nThus it is said: All know goodness when it is good—then not-goodness arises.\n\nWhat the world deems beautiful is the numinous and strange,\nWhat it deems ugly is the stinking and rotten.\nThe numinous and strange transform into the stinking and rotten,\nThe stinking and rotten transform into the numinous and strange—\nThen how can beauty and ugliness be distinguished?\n\nWhat was once right may later be wrong,\nWhat is now discarded may later be used—\nThen how can good and not-good be chosen?\n\nThe sage embodies the true *wu* while constantly *you*,\nManifests subtle function while constantly *wu*—\nBeauty and ugliness, good and not-good,\nAre to be simplified yet cannot be grasped—\nHow then can ugliness and not-goodness burden?\n\nThe *Cushui* says:\nUnder Heaven, there is no second Dao.\nFrom their unity, the names of beauty and ugliness vanish,\nOne nature without nature—\nFrom their origin, the distinctions of good and evil do not stand.\nYet there is high and low, with the latter as its subordinate,\nThus there is beauty with ugliness as its opposite,\nThere is left and right, with the latter as its subordinate,\nThus there is good with not-good as its opposite.\n\nTo have one without the other is to desire *yin* without *yang*—\nHow can this be achieved?\n\nThe people of the world know one aspect yet not the other,\nTaking the numinous and strange as beautiful,\nThe stinking and rotten as ugly,\nYet beauty and ugliness fill the heart—\nThis is deemed right, that is deemed wrong,\nAnd good and not-good oppose each other.\n\nYet they fail to know that Great Transformation is unceasing,\nInstantly shifting—\nThe straight becomes strange, the good becomes ominous,\nThe stinking and rotten, the numinous and strange—\nAlternating, transforming.\nInitially, there is no beauty or ugliness,\nPrinciple has no constant right,\nAffairs have no constant wrong—\nSometimes right, sometimes wrong,\nGained then lost.\nInitially, there is no good or not-good,\nLife and death, giving and taking—\nAlso divided, also successive—\nHow can one judge them as different?\n\nOnly the sage awakens to this and merges into the mysterious,\nExhausts the truth of things while guarding their root,\nCommands the transformation of things while guarding their origin—\nThough *wuwei*, yet not neglectful of action,\nEmbodying true *wu* while constantly *you*,\nThough engaged in affairs, yet emerging from non-action,\nManifesting subtle function while constantly *wu*.\nThus, extinguishing preferences in unity,\nAnd entrusting right and wrong to the two processes.",

they become **excessively strong**,\nOr **err through excess**.\nIf they **lean toward yin**, they become **weak**,\nOr **err through deficiency**.\n\nNeither **excess** nor **deficiency**—\nThis is called **supreme qi**.\n**Supreme qi** is **the middle**,\nThus it is called **great harmony**.\n\nThe **high** are **checked**,\nThe **low** are **raised**,\nThose with **excess** are **taken

envelops the **six extremes**,\nHow could it **be overfull**?\n\nThe **Explanatory Commentary** states:\n“The Dao can **be transmitted** yet cannot **be received**—\nBecause it can **be transmitted**, there is **sentience** and **trustworthiness**,\nThus there is **application**.\nA **single thread’s** subtlety,\nIf **nurtured** to **flourish**—\nIs this not **sentience**?\nA **dragonfly’s** minuteness,\nIf **supported** to **take wing**—\nIs this not **sentience**?\n**Cold and heat** **await** it to **come and go**,\nYet it **does not force** the **seasons**—\nIs this not

**unstirred**—\nIs this not **acting without action**?\n\n**Dim** and **silent**, **hidden** and **mysterious**,\n**Seized** yet **not obtained**—\nIs this not **forming without form**?\n\nThe *Classic* states:\n“All things bear **yin** and embrace **yang**,\n**Supreme qi** brings them into **harmony**.”\n\n**Yin** **halts** and **becomes still**,\nAll things **bear** it.\n**Yang** **melts** and **becomes smooth**,\nAll things **embrace** it.\n\nIf one **follows Heaven** yet lacks **Earth**,\nIt **leans toward yang** and **errs through excess**.\nIf one **follows Earth** yet lacks **Heaven**,\nIt **leans toward yin** and **errs through deficiency**.\n\nThere must be **the middle of yin and yang**,\n**Excessively strong** yet **not erring through excess**,\n**Weak** yet **not erring through deficiency**—\nThis is **supreme qi**.\n\nThe **nature** of **supreme qi**,\n**Heaven One** is its **root**,\n**Heaven Five** is its **middle**—\nThus **Kun** is **the middle**,\n**The middle** **connects above and below**,\nThis is called **great harmony**,\nThe Dao’s **ultimate application** lies here.\n\nThus:\nThe **high** are **checked** to **reduce their excess**,\nThe **low** are **raised** to **supplement their deficiency**,\nThose with **excess** are **taken from**,\nSo **great** yet **not excessive**,\nThose with **deficiency** are **given

exhausted**.\n\nOnly the Dao **cannot be encompassed** by **fullness** or **emptiness**,\nThus it **lends and fulfills**,\nYet its **application** is **unending**—\nThe more one **takes** for others, the more one **owns**,\nThe more one **gives** to others, the more one **possesses**.\n\nLike the **Great Void** enveloping the **six extremes**,\nWith **no boundaries**,\n**Immeasurable**,\nCould it **be confined** by **vessels**?\nHow could it **be overfull**?\n\n**Deep**—\nIt **seems like** the **source of all things**.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation** says:\n“Zhuangzi said:\n*The

Dao—\nThus it is only **seeming** like this.”\n\nThe **Explanatory Commentary** states:\n“Zhuangzi said:\n*The Dao is deep in its dwelling.*\n**Depth** reflects **flowing water’s** **returning** **wholeness**,\n**Stillness** is **profound** and **level**,\n**Inner clarity** yet **outer obscurity**,\nThough **turtle’s** **stillness** and **flowing water’s** **stillness** differ,\nIt remains **deep** as itself—\n**Probing** it reveals **greater depth**,\n**Exhausting** it reveals **greater distance**,\nThis can be called **emptiness**.\n**Waves** are **not evil**,\n**Stillness** is **not beautiful**—\nThis can be called **stillness**.\nThe Dao’s **essence** resembles this—\nOnly **emptiness**,\nThus it **suffices** to **encompass** the **world’s** **substantial** things;\nOnly **stillness**,\nThus it **suffices** to **embrace** the **world’s** **movements**.\n**Not becoming** things yet **able to make** things **become**,\nThe **root** of all things;\n**Not transforming** yet **able to make** transformations **fulfill**,\nThe **foundation** of **transformation**—\nThus it **seems like** the **source of all things**.”\n\n*The Wenzzi* states:\n*“The **Empty and Unrestrained**,\nThe **source of all things**.”*\nIts **meaning aligns** with this.\n\nThough the Dao **responds** to things **occasionally**,\nIt **originally has no roots**—\n**Moving** through all things,\nThings **naturally follow** it—\nSaying *“the source of all things”*\nIs only **seeming** like this, yet **not truly**.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation** says:\n*“Sharpness** **harms**,\n**Agitation** **mixes**—\n**Blunting** its **sharpness**, it **does not contend**,\n**Relieving** its **agitation**, it **does not disorder**.\n**Harmonizing** its **light**—\nZhuangzi’s

toward the ten thousand things,\nthe sage toward the people—\nthey assist their natural unfolding,\nwith no heart of love or profit.\nVirtue cannot be named thus.\n\nStraw bundled as a dog,\nused in sacrifices—\nwhen appropriate, it is employed;\nwhen spent, it is discarded.\nHow could there be room for the heart\nin the self-generation of the ten thousand things,\nor in the self-governance of the people?\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nTo love people and benefit things is called *bian* (perverse).\nIf the heart is set on loving people,\nits love is not comprehensive;\nif the heart is set on benefiting things,\nits benefit is not thorough.\nFor even when virtue is taken as benevolence,\nthe heart cannot be entirely absent.\n\nMoreover, the origin of benevolence\nalways stems from harm,\nand the origin of harm\nalways arises from benevolence.\nWhere there is harm, benevolence follows;\nwhere there is benevolence, harm ensues—\nthis is the natural order.\n\nHeaven and Earth have no heart toward the ten thousand things,\nthe sage has no heart toward the people.\nThey follow nature without artificial augmentation,\nthus loving all without partiality,\nbenefiting all without exclusion.\nThose who receive the gift do not repay,\nthose who are nourished do not thank—\nbenefits extend to all ages.\nIf not for loving people,\nhow could virtue be named?\n\nZhuangzi’s *great virtue* is *not virtue*—\njust like the sacrificial dog:\nBefore its use, it is adorned in a wicker basket,\nwrapped in embroidered cloth,\nand the ritual officiant, in solemn purity, presents it.\nOnce used, travelers strike its head and spine,\nand the poor take it to cook—\nand that is all.\n\nHow could there be room for the heart\nin the self-generation of the ten thousand things,\nor in the self-governance of the people?\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nis it not like the *tuqiao*?\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:**\nThe *tuqiao* is empty yet receptive,\nreceptive yet responsive—\nthus its response is boundless.\nIf filled with substance,\nit becomes obstructed at every touch.\nIn the Dao, this is one-sidedness;\nin things, this is distortion.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nThe *tu* can contain,\nthe *qiao* can resonate—\nboth are empty yet receptive,\nreceptive yet responsive.\nHow could there be exhaustion in responding to sensation?\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\none *qi* subtly circulates,\npervading without exclusion,\nuntil the limit of demand is reached—\njust like the *tuqiao*.\nIf one thing fills it,\nthere is no place without obstruction.\nHow could Heaven and Earth,\nvast as they are,\nbe confined to one-sidedness,\nor stagnant in distortion?\n\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever emerging.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:**\nEmpty oneself to roam the world,\nand one responds broadly yet precisely—\nthus, *empty yet unyielding*.\nPressured into action,\none’s capacity is boundless—\nthus, *moving yet ever emerging*.\nThe sage responds to the Sovereign without the burden of words—\nthis is it.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nThe vastness of Heaven and Earth—\nthe sage models himself upon it,\nemptying his essence,\nyet fully manifesting in his actions.\nReturning action to essence,\nhe remains motionless yet encompasses all things,\ntilting none to his advantage,\nthus responding universally—\nwhat could be more appropriate?\n\nArising from essence, his actions are boundless—\nhaving already given all to others,\nhow could there be exhaustion?\nEmptying himself to roam the world,\nhe acts only when pressed—\nthus, his entire life speaks without error,\nand his deeds are without artifice.\n\nIn responding to the Sovereign,\nthere is ample reserve.\nThis is what Zhuangzi called\nthe Sovereign’s function,\nthe sage’s remaining task.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to hold the center.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:**\nThe *qiao* is empty, awaiting *qi*—\nwhen *qi* arrives, it sounds;\nwhen *qi* does not come, it is silent.\nThe sage’s speech is like this.\nThe sophists’ constraints—\nthough their speech is much,\nthey cannot escape entanglement—\nbetter to hold the center than this.\n\nCultivate your interior,\nclose your exterior,\nretract your gaze, reverse your hearing—\nthus returning to see the heart of Heaven and Earth.\nThis is called *holding the center*.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nAll music arises from emptiness.\nThe *qiao*, as an instrument,\nis the origin of pitch, measure, and weight.\nMusic’s foundation lies here.\nThus the *Odes* speak of “not overstepping the *qiao*,”\nmeaning *empty to await qi*—\nwhen *qi* arrives, it sounds;\nwhen *qi* does not come, it is silent.\n\nThe sage’s speech, when obtained,\nresolves resonance to accord with pitch—\nresponding only when questioned,\nnever deviating from this.\nThus Confucius desired silence,\nand Mencius considered eloquence a reluctant necessity—\nthis is why.\n\nThose who cannot forget speech,\nrambling on to tens of thousands of words,\nfilling libraries with five chariots of texts—\nthese are the sophists’ constraints.\nThough much, what use is it?\n\nThe holder of the center is otherwise:\nreaching the truth of things while guarding their root,\ncommanding their transformation while guarding their origin,\ncautious of the exterior without its manifold disputes,\nclosed to the interior without its thousandfold errors.\n\nThe eyes see nothing—\nretracting vision,\nvision turns to the obscure;\nthe ears hear nothing—\nreversing hearing,\nhearing turns to the soundless.\nReturning to self-awareness,\nthe heart of Heaven and Earth becomes plainly visible.\nGuard this without loss—\nthough one speaks not a word all life,\none has never failed to speak.\nWhy clamor then?\n\nFor the center unites above and below—\nthis is called the *great root of the world*.\nSpeech cannot exhaust this—\neven if one speaks much to exchange it,\nbetter to hold the center.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit** (*Gǔshén Zhāng*)\nThe Valley Spirit does not die,",

Hence, *the Supreme Good is like Water*.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nYin and yang are the great movements of *qi*.\nFrom the perspective of *qi* before it manifests, it is neither yin nor yang—this is the Dao/Way.\nAll things bear yin within and embrace yang; from their operation in the myriad things, it is said that they do not depart from yin and yang—this too is the Dao/Way.\n*The Classic of Changes* says: “The interplay of one yin and one yang is called the Dao/Way”—this is merely speaking of things.\nDescending from the Dao/Way, what humans desire most is virtue, and so it is said that what follows the Dao/Way is virtue.\nSince the Dao/Way is singular, once it is called virtue, it is divided from the Dao/Way.\nTheir division is their succession, hence Zhuangzi says: “To depart from the Dao/Way for the sake of virtue.”\nFor once the name of virtue is established, the undivided whole is split, and the body of the Dao/Way is impaired.\n\nYet, the Nine Categories begin with the Five Phases, and the Five Phases prioritize Water—thus, Heaven’s One generates Water, though it departs slightly from the Dao/Way.\nThough it overflows, it does not lose its measure—it is deep and empty.\nWhen clarified, it reveals even the finest hairs; when still, it is luminous.\nWhat under Heaven is more refined than this? And so, *the Supreme Good is like Water*—unlike those who merely know virtue as virtue.\n\nWater is good at benefiting all things without contention,\ndwelling where all detest it—\nthus it approaches the Dao/Way.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nWhen it melts, it becomes rain and dew, nourishing all;\nwhen it congeals, it becomes frost and snow, shaping all.\nWhen dispersed, it becomes rivers and streams; when gathered, it forms lakes and marshes.\nDeep as springs, vast as seas—it is drawn for use, stored for reserve, and abundant.\nIt generates and nourishes all things, yet never exhausts them.\nWho benefits all things better than this?\n\nIts beneficence to all things—\nin Heaven, as rain and dew, all things receive its blessings;\non Earth, as springs and depths, all things accept its gifts.\nYet its nature is yielding and weak,\nalways dwelling in non-contention, receiving filth and defilement,\nnot seeking its own good, unburdened by self-regard—\nthus it approaches the Dao/Way.\n*Ji* means “near.”\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nHeaven’s One generates Water, flowing without end.\nIn Heaven, when yang-*qi* prevails, it melts into rain and dew,\nspreading to nourish all things, thus all are nourished.\nWhen yin-*qi* prevails, it congeals into frost and snow,\nengraving to complete all things, thus all treasures are formed.\nOn Earth, it disperses as rivers and streams,\ngathers as lakes and marshes;\nits encompassing return to wholeness is the depth of springs—\nwhen measured, its end is unseen—\nthe vastness of seas—\ndrawn for use, stored for reserve, and abundant.\nIts generation and nourishment are inexhaustible;\nall things rely on it without depletion,\ntaking as they need, given as they require—\nwho benefits all things better than this?\n\nIts beneficence to all things—\nin Heaven, as rain and dew, all things receive its blessings;\non Earth, as springs and depths, all things accept its gifts.\nYet its nature is yielding and weak,\nalways dwelling in non-contention, receiving filth and defilement,\nnot seeking its own good, unburdened by self-regard—\nthus it approaches the Dao/Way.\n*Ji* is the subtle beginning of movement—\n*ji* means “near,” for it is the movement before reaching its destination.\nTo approach the Dao/Way is to be near the Dao/Way.\n\n**Residing in the good of place,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nIt flows through the earth, yet never overflows.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nWater is called “moistening the low”—\nthus it moves through the earth.\nIt fills the depressions before advancing—\nthus it flows without overflowing.\n\n**The mind is good at depth,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nThe deeper it is measured, the deeper it becomes;\nthe farther it is explored, the vaster it grows.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nA thousand *ren* of height is insufficient to fathom its depth—\nthe deeper it is measured, the deeper it becomes;\na thousand *li* of breadth is insufficient to contain its vastness—\nthe farther it is explored, the vaster it grows.\n\n**To act with goodness is to be benevolent,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nIt loves all without selfishness, giving without discrimination.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nWherever frost and dew fall, there is no far or near—\nall under Heaven is encompassed by its blessings,\ntruly loving all without selfishness, giving without discrimination.\n\n**To speak with goodness is to be trustworthy,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nIt avoids obstacles to reach the seas,\ntraverses dangers without losing its course.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nIt studies the sea and arrives at the sea—\nthis is to avoid obstacles to reach the seas.\nThough it twists a myriad times, it must return to the east—\nthis is to traverse dangers without losing its course.\n\n**To govern with goodness is to bring order,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nIt cleanses the impure, smooths the perilous,\nfollowing the natural course of things, without contrivance—\nthus nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nBy its ebb and flow, it attains purity—\nthus it cleanses the impure.\nIts measure is even and balanced—\nthus it smooths the perilous.\nIf it follows its natural course,\nthere is no contrivance of the heart.\nThus, though it appears undirected,\nnothing remains ungoverned.\n\n**To act with goodness is to be capable,**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nIt adapts to the terrain to form curves and straight paths,\nconforms to vessels to become round and square,\nits changes are ever-varying yet ever-constant—\nwho is as capable as this?\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* says:\nIts flow follows natural paths—\nthus it adapts to the terrain to form curves and straight paths.\nIt responds as taken—\nthus it conforms to vessels to become round and square.\nIt can be

things possess **numbers** (數),\nand **Spirit** and **Essence** precede the manifestation of **numbers**.\nThus, **Spirit** and **Essence** arise from the Dao—\nbecause the **illuminating** (昭昭) is

contrivance,\nhe harbors neither judgment of right and wrong\nnor taste for good and evil—\nthus his **Qi** is **Stillness** without distraction,\ncapable of **Softness** without excess.\n\nIndeed, **Will** commands **Qi** like a general,\na unified **Will** suffices to move **Qi**.\n**Mencius** said:\n*\"The faltering and rushing—\nthis is **Qi**,\nyet it disrupts the heart.\"*\n\nThus, concentrating **Qi** originates from the heart’s **One** and unchanging nature.\nIf **One** and unchanging,\nthen all things cannot sway the heart,\nand **Qi** naturally concentrates.\n\nIf the heart fails to focus **Qi**,\nthen **Qi** falters and rushes unnaturally,\nand the heart grows **arrogant and unchecked**—\nunable to be contained.\nThis is like a strong beam\nnot bending to avoid death—\nhow can it remain like an infant?\n\nThe Sage empties himself to wander through the world,\nand when adversity comes,\nhe regards it as a **hollow boat** drifting on **floating tiles**,\nthus able to preserve **Softness**.\nHis heart, free from forcing **Qi**,\nwhat difference lies between him and an infant?\n\n**Mencius** said:\n*\"When **Qi** is at its utmost vast and firm,\nnourished upright without harm,\nit fills the space between Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nYet **Laozi** spoke of concentrating **Qi** to achieve **Softness**—\nwhy so?\n\nUtmost **Vastness** aligns with the **Dao/Way**,\nutmost **Firmness** aligns with **Righteousness**.\n**Mencius** spoke of utmost **Firmness**,\nemphasizing **action in Righteousness**,\ndiscussing **Qi’s** application.\n**Laozi** spoke of **Softness**,\nemphasizing **return to Nature**,\ndiscussing **Qi’s** root.\n\nIf **Guan Yin** [关尹] takes its **pure Qi** [纯气],\nand **Huzi** [壶子] takes its **balanced Qi** [衡气],\ntheir words each hold truth—\nthus it is.\n\nThe ancient spread of the **Dao/Way**,\nnowhere absent—\nthis is why.\n\n**Purification** and **profound insight**,\ncan they be without flaw?\n\n**Emperor Hui’s** annotation states:\n*\"The Sage uses this to cleanse the heart,\nthus purifying all actions without attachment.\nHe uses this to retreat and hide in **secrecy** [密],\nthus gazing into **mysteries** and recognizing **principles** in silence.\"*\n\nIf such is the case,\nhis **body** remains **pure and simple** without burden,\nhis errors pass without regret,\nhis actions align without self-congratulation—\nwhat flaw could there be?\n\nThe **Annotations** state:\n*\"The ancients held that before **things** began to exist was **unattained** [未至],\nand only when reaching **before things began to exist** [未始有物]\nwas it **attained**—\nthus **purification** of all actions without attachment.\nUsing this to cleanse the heart,\nwho could have even a hair’s breadth of disturbance?\nThat which has **words** and **nearness** is not **true** [真],\nand only when reaching **forgetting words and ceasing contrivance** [忘言息迩]\nis it **true**—\nthus **profound insight**

**pure and simple** without burden,\nunmixed with anything, undiminished.\nHis **Spirit** rides the **times** [时] to act,\nthough errors occur,\nin **times** he cannot avoid them—\nthus errors pass without regret.\nFollowing **principles** to move,\nhis alignment is inevitable—\nin **principles** he cannot avoid it—\nthus actions align without self-congratulation.\nWhat flaw could there be?\"\n\nTo love the people and govern the realm,\ncan one be without **action** [为]?\n\n**Emperor Hui’s** annotation states:\n*\"With **benevolence** [仁] to love the people,\nwith **wisdom** [智] to govern the realm,\nspreading **teaching** and **refining laws**,\nto unify the world with **goodness**—\nhow difficult is this in terms of **non-action** [无为]!\n\nThe Sage’s benefit and nourishment

harmony;\nthough it appears turbulent, it remains at peace.\nIn interacting with things yet not transforming with them,\nit is not that one avoids interaction to attain distinction,\nbut rather that one distinguishes while interacting.\n\nThus, when all things arise together,\none observes their *Return*.\nThough Laozi speaks of the *Return* as the \"arising together,\"\nit is because there is a cessation of arising.\n\nThe principles may differ,\nbut their path to insightful observation is one and the same.\n\nThings are myriad and varied,\neach returning to its root.\nThe Emperor Huizong’s

them yet do not refuse,\nand all things return with them yet do not linger.\nThus, from spring to summer,\nit is Heaven’s emergence and humanity’s reception;\nfrom autumn to winter,\nit is humanity’s

gathered state;\nthey toil in *Kǎn* (Abyss),\nwhich governs the north and corresponds to winter—\nwhen all things return to their roots,\nthus discarding brilliance for substance,\nand returning to their innate nature and dwelling.\n\nWhen myriad forms arise together,\nit is the spring qi emerging and all grasses sprouting.\nWhen their radiant essence unfurls outward,\nthen they grow and flourish.\nWhen they discard brilliance for substance,\nthen autumn arrives and all treasures mature.\nWhen they return to their innate dwelling,\nthen they vanish into the void of nothingness.\n\nThe *Yì Classic* says:\n*\"Each attains its own nature and fate,*\npreserving the Great Harmony.\"\n\nThose who cast the Great Pivot and congeal form\nhave already uniformly received nature and

*nature* is the root of *fate*.\n\nHumanity’s possession of life\nbegins with essence and follows with spirit.\nTo preserve one’s essence,\none must gather one’s spirit—\nfor *essence* is the mother of *spirit*,\nand *spirit* is its child.\n\nOnly when one knows that nature attains fate,\ncan one return to the fundamental root,\npreserving life without harming nature;\nonly when one gathers

through essence?\nWhen it is said that *perfecting nature attains fate*,\nis it not through knowing nature attains fate?\n\nZhuangzi expounds on the Dao of pure simplicity,\nbeginning with the unity of essence and ending with\n*\"no depletion of spirit\"*—\nthus the perfection of essence and the supremacy of spirit are clear.\n\nMencius discusses the path of *exhausting the heart*,\nbeginning with *\"nurturing nature to serve Heaven\"*\nand ending with *\"cultivating the body to establish fate\"*—\nthus perfecting nature to attain fate is clear.\n\nTo grasp this truth,\none need only observe the *Return* as a secondary matter\nin comprehending the principles of all things.\n\nReturning to the root is called *stillness*,\nand *stillness* is the *Return* to fate.\nThe Emperor

heavens,\nthings align with *without recklessness*.\"*\n*Without recklessness*, things attain their true nature.\n\nBut when one is lost and cannot restore,\nthey lose their nature and reach its end,\nunable to nurture life—\nthis is recklessness indeed.\n\n**Knowing the constant Dao, one attains *rest*.**\nThe *Explication* says:\n*\"He who knows the Dao’s true constancy\nsees that all things arise from One.\nThus, when observing the world,\nthough myriad and conflicting,\nall are equally the utmost marvel—\nwho can distinguish right and wrong, good and evil?\n\nTo reject what is wrong and uphold what is right\narises from clinging to fixed views;\nto love what is good and hate what is evil\narises from indulging private desires.\nThe perfected sage abandons the burden of fixed views,\nforgets right and wrong,\nand transcends private desires,\nharmonizing good and evil—\nthis is no other than knowing the constant Dao.\n\nTo know the constant Dao is to empty oneself and wander through the world,\nachieving flawlessness.\nRight and wrong, good and evil do not dwell in the heart,\nthus one can embrace all without exclusion.\n\nThe sage’s governance empties the heart—\nthis is how.\n\n**Embracing all is *public*.**\nThe *Explication* says:\n*\"Without a heart of embracing,\none does not solely love one’s own kin,\nnor solely cherish one’s own children—\nwhat private desires remain?\n\nTo perceive things through their forms\nis to indulge private desires;\nto merge with the Dao without heart\nis to attain universal harmony.\nThus the sage governs the world as a family,\nnurtures all people equally,\nand without a heart of embracing,\nloves without limit,\nshowers mercy without bounds—\nwhat private desires remain?\n\nEven Heaven and Earth, when viewed,\ncover all without partiality,\nbear all without discrimination—\nall within the realm of the two cannot escape their embrace.\nThus embracing all is *public*—\nthis is how the sage is seen in Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Being *public* is *royal*.**\nThe *Explication* says:\n*\"The Dao’s practice is universal,\nwhat all people share and follow—\nthis is what the *Records of Rites* cite,\nthe words of Zhongni,\nexplaining why the Dao’s practice is universal,\nand the world rejoices in its embrace without weariness.\n\nThe essence of governance lies in knowing the Dao,\nwhile the sage’s Way serves all hearts.\nThe sage governs the world through the Dao,\nreceives the Dao with the heart—\nthus people are drawn to emulate and return to them,\ntheir sincerity and service flowing naturally,\nenduring forever without ceasing,\nas the world willingly embraces it without restraint.\n\nThis is what the *Classic of Changes* means by:\n*'The people align with what is able.'*\n\n**Royal is Heaven, Heaven is the Dao.**\nThe *Explication* says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth establish their positions,\nthe sage fulfills their abilities—\nwithin the realm, the Four Great Ones,\nthe king stands at their center.\n\nThis is he who unites Heaven, Earth, and people,\nstanding at the center of all—\nthe king.\n\nOne is not separate from the realm of numbers,\nbut the origin of all counts;\nGreat is not separate from form,\nbut the culmination of all bodies.\nLight and clarity reside above,\nbroadly covering and embracing—\nthis is One, great above, without

transformation—\nthis is what all Heaven, Earth, and people follow—\nthe Dao.\n\nThe king is the ultimate of human Dao.\nIf one exhausts the human Dao,\nthey align with Heaven—\nis this not *exhausting all people aligns with Heaven*?\n\nZhuangzi says:\n*'The king is the Dao of Heaven.'*\nThus, the king is Heaven—\nthis is clear.\n\nHeaven is the great source of the Dao.\nIf one takes Heaven as their origin,\nthey merge with the Dao—\nis this not *embodying Heaven aligns with the Dao*?\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*'Heaven follows the Dao.'*\nThus, Heaven is the Dao—\nthis is

      "translated_text": "The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n*\"To govern the world with leniency, one attains tranquility with all under Heaven. Without the joy of striving, praise does not reach him; without the toil of exhaustion, fear of regret does not come. Actions occur without effort, yet they are ever natural—thus the lowly know its existence.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains:\n*\"The world has its inherent nature, and that nature has its inherent virtue. To abide within it is to preserve without perishing—this prevents excess; to yield to it is to release without abandoning—this guards against deviation. If one does not exceed its nature nor alter its virtue, then the world will transform of itself, and one attains serenity with all under Heaven. The Sage governs the world through the Dao, ever ensuring the people have no knowledge, no desire—so that even the wise dare not act. Though people may possess knowledge, there is no use for it; how then could there be the joy of striving or the labor of exhaustion? Without the joy of striving, the heart remains undisturbed, and praise does not reach him; without the labor of exhaustion, the heart remains at ease, and fear of slander does not come. Without desire yet self-sufficient, without action yet naturally settled, effortlessly expansive and harmonious—one attains what one attains without doing, for this is the way of forgetting in the Dao. This is what is meant by ‘the lowly know its existence.’ As Mencius said of the ruler’s people: ‘Their virtue shines like the sun and moon.’ Only at this moment is this true.\n\n*\"Next comes the state of being praised and honored. The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n*\"When benevolence extends to the people and law endures for the ages, all under Heaven love the ruler as a parent—thus he is honored. His renown rises like the sun and moon—thus he is praised. This is the governance of the sage-king, where the traces of praise and honor are manifest, yet the Way of Great Unity is lost.\n\n*\"Zhuangzi said: ‘Shun’s virtue was pure, and the people rejoiced in him.’ The *Odes* speak of the people of King Wen first gathering at Lingtai. The *Cushui* commentary explains:\n*\"Nothing benefits the people more than benevolence. Shun’s virtue of cherishing life permeated the hearts of the people; in the Zhou, governance was refined and benevolence was applied—this is the benevolence extending to the people. Nothing establishes order better than law. Shun established laws for all under Heaven, which could be passed down to future generations; in the Zhou, all affairs were fully attended to—this is the law enduring for the ages. When benevolence extends to the people and law endures for the ages, ruling with such care is like nurturing an infant. All under Heaven love the ruler as a parent—who would not cherish and honor him? When such governance is applied, his fame spreads far and wide, his renown rises like the sun and moon—who would not rejoice and praise him? The rise of the sage-emperor and the completion of the sage-king’s work—his virtue and deeds surpass all under Heaven, beyond concealment. None have not rooted themselves in this, which is why the governance of the sage-king bears the clear traces of praise and honor. Yet if this is so, then the Way of Great Unity is diminished, and there is a question between this and ‘the lowly know its existence.’\n\n*\"Indeed, in Great Unity, the people have no knowledge, no desire—how then could there be praise and honor? In ancient times, Shun’s virtue was pure, and the people of Dengxu came in tens of thousands; King Wen’s spiritual virtue made the people joyful, and the *Odes* of Lingtai marked the beginning of their allegiance. The means by which the sage-king’s governance brings praise and honor is this. Yet the Sage does not truly intend the people’s praise and honor. When great virtue and mighty deeds are bestowed upon the world, praise and honor naturally follow, without expectation.\n\n*\"Next comes the state of being feared and reviled. The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n*\"He governs with laws and unifies with punishments—thus he is feared. If all under Heaven are rewarded, the virtuous are not encouraged; if all under Heaven are punished, the wicked are not deterred. There were lords like the Duke of Chu questioning the weight of the tripod, and ministers like Yang Hu stealing great bows and jade—these are the customs of a declining age, hence he is reviled.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains:\n*\"The Sage governs the world through the Dao, and laws and punishments, rewards and penalties, serve only to assist the Dao in its practice. Laws and punishments clarify the world’s defenses, so the people have something to uphold; rewards and penalties demonstrate the world’s preferences, so the people know what to avoid—all rooted in the Dao. If one relies solely on laws and punishments without the Dao, it may reform outward appearance but cannot transform the heart—thus he is feared, and even reviled.\n\n*\"To govern through virtue is already to govern through laws. To govern through laws is to lack virtue. To unify through ritual is already to unify through punishments. To unify through punishments is to lack ritual. To govern through laws and unify through punishments is to be feared because the people’s hearts are scattered. If all under Heaven are rewarded, the virtuous are not encouraged; if all under Heaven are punished, the wicked are not deterred. There are those like the Duke of Chu and Yang Hu who revile, for they do not know the Dao’s governance of the world. If laws are used to govern and punishments to defend, and if legal measures are clear—so that rewards are given without encouragement and punishments without fear—then encouragement and deterrence are naturally aligned with the Dao. This is not the lesser path of deficiency, but the greater path where the Dao still endures. Thus, trust is insufficient, and distrust arises.\n\n*\"The Emperor Huizong’s commentary states:\n*\"What binds and separates is not done with glue and lacquer; what restrains and loosens is not done with ropes and cords—this is the utmost trust. When the Shang made oaths, the people began to doubt; when the Zhou established assemblies, the people began to doubt—this is because trust was insufficient. When the Sage’s governance is such that ‘the lowly know its existence,’ then actions align without the people knowing it as trust. Next comes the state of being feared and reviled, where cunning, deceit, and scheming arise, and distrust follows.\n\n*\"The *Classic* says: ‘Within it lies trust.’ Thus, trust comes naturally.

      "translated_text": "*The Classic of Rites* says: **\"Great trust requires no binding.\"**\nThus, trust is naturally sincere in others, needing no coercion or command.\n\n*The Classic of Rites* also states: *\"When the Shang made oaths, the people began to rebel; when the Zhou established assemblies, the people began to doubt.\"* This is because trust was insufficient, relying on coercion and command.\n\nIndeed, **ultimate trust** arises from what is inherently true—never giving rise to doubt. When trust is insufficient, it loses its essential truth, and thus distrust arises.\n\nIn the **highest governance**, the people, in their natural simplicity, are unaware of its presence, yet their actions align without knowing it as trust. In the next stage, when they are feared and scorned, their customs decay, the pure and genuine disperse, and the vulgar and artful emerge—thus, deceit and scheming arise, and distrust follows.\n\n*The Book of Changes* says: **\"Without words, yet trusted—this lies in virtue and conduct.\"**\nFor when the essence is profound and the heart is in accord, this is called **ultimate trust**. But if one resorts to cunning and deceit, confusing the people with clever arguments and shamelessness, what trust remains? It is because trust was insufficient.\n\n**Ah! How precious are words.**\nThe **Emperor’s commentary** says: *\"When viewed through the Dao, the ruler of the world is upright—how then can words be spoken lightly?\"* One must be cautious and never reckless. Thus, when words are spoken, they become the Dao for the world; when conduct is carried out, they transform the world.\n\nThe **explanatory notes** say: *\"Words are words, but their meaning is not yet fixed.\"* When viewed through the Dao, the speaker has never truly spoken—only the true ruler exists in stillness, thus the world’s ruler is upright. Words are like waves—how then can they be spoken lightly? One must be cautious and never reckless. Words cannot be spoken lightly—that is what ‘Ah! How precious!’ means. Words must not be spoken lightly—that is what ‘precious words’ means.\n\nThe ancients inscribed warnings on golden statues and guarded against blemishes on white jade—thus it is clear that words cannot be spoken lightly. Therefore, the Sage speaks, and the people do not doubt; thus, words become the Dao for the world. When one reveals the truth and acts accordingly, conduct becomes the Dao in itself, transforming the world.\n\nWhy is this so? Because when spoken, it resonates with the law; when acted upon, it aligns with the Way—thus, none under the heavens fail to be sincere.

      "translated_text": "**Explanatory Notes on the Dao De Jing by Jiang Rong, Student of the Imperial Daoist Academy**\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Dao and Virtue/Power in Decline**\n\nWhen the Great Dao declines, there arises **virtue** and **righteousness**;\nThe **Emperor Hui Zong**’s annotation states: *\"When the Dao is lost, then virtue emerges; when virtue is lost, then righteousness arises; when righteousness is lost, then propriety follows. Righteousness establishes others, propriety establishes oneself—yet this is ever farther from the Dao.\"*\n\n**Han Yu** failed to grasp the Sage’s true intent regarding **Dao** and **virtue/power**, instead claiming that **virtue** and **righteousness** are fixed names, while **Dao** and **virtue/power** are mere empty positions. The **Master Lao**’s minor **virtue** and **righteousness** reflect a limited perspective—what **Zhuang Zi** called the *\"veiled and ignorant folk.\"*\n\nThe **Explanatory Notes** clarify: *\"The fullness of the Dao lies hidden in the undifferentiated chaos, while virtue/power is a division of the Dao, manifesting as the interplay of firmness and yielding. Since the Dao cannot be fully attained, its loss gives rise to virtue/power. Since virtue/power cannot be fully realized, its decline spawns righteousness. Righteousness can be cultivated, and when cultivated, it approaches propriety—thus, when righteousness is lost, propriety emerges, making one ever more distant from the Dao. In its essence, the Dao is singular—just as **Yang Zi** said: *‘When unified, it is whole; when divided, it scatters.’* Han Yu, failing to grasp the Sage’s intent, resorted to subjective distortion, positing that **virtue** and **righteousness** are fixed names while **Dao** and **virtue/power** are empty terms. He labeled the **Master Lao**’s minor **righteousness** as a narrow view, yet he did not realize that the **Seven Virtues** are all contained within **Dao** and **virtue/power**. If **Dao** and **virtue/power** do not decline, why would one need the **Seven Virtues**? Examining the root, even if one rejects **virtue** and **righteousness**, they already operate within the realm of **Dao** and **virtue/power**. Could his heart truly believe that **virtue** and **righteousness** are insufficient for governing the world? His minor **virtue** and **righteousness** are merely a means to elevate them—precisely what **Zhuang Zi** called the *‘veiled and ignorant folk.’*\n\nLater generations, obscured by worldly learning, lacked higher insight. Upon hearing the **Master Lao**’s teachings, they either dismissed them as madness or defamed them as crude and shallow. In the final age, scholars spend their lives in vain, only to become **petty Confucianists**—Han Yu’s critique is well-founded.\n\nWhen wisdom and insight emerge, there arises **great deceit**;\nThe **Emperor Hui Zong**’s annotation states: *\"When the people’s wisdom and strength are exhausted, deceit follows.\"*\n\nThe **Explanatory Notes** clarify: *\"In an age of perfect virtue/power, the people act without knowing why, move without knowing where they go. They follow their nature and find contentment; they accept their lot and remain at peace. Ambition and craft are forgotten. What need have the people’s hearts for wisdom and strength? When desire and calculation first arise, external temptations lure them. When wisdom fails, they grow perplexed; when strength fails, they grow sluggish. Losing their natural state, they sink into artificial contrivance—this is when the people’s wisdom and strength are exhausted, and deceit takes over. The Sage, in governing with forbearance, seeks to restore the people to their natural state, yet does not rule through wisdom and strength alone. Thus, **Lie Zi** says: *‘The Sage relies on the Dao’s transformation, not on wisdom and cleverness.’*\n\nWhen familial bonds are fractured, there arises **filial piety and kindness**;\nWhen the state is in chaos, there arise **loyal ministers**.",

      "translated_text": "The Emperor Huizong annotated: *\"Names arise from insufficiency.\"*\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"A filial son does not flatter his parents; a loyal minister does not fawn upon his lord.\"* This is the peak of the subject’s virtue.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary states: *\"A name is the guest of reality. If reality is present, the name follows naturally. Yet names always arise from insufficiency.\"*\n\nWhen a gentleman achieves renown, nothing surpasses loyalty and filial piety. Serving one’s parents, he does not choose a place to settle—this is filial piety. If he merely agrees with his parents’ words and approves of their deeds to flatter them, this is not true filial piety. Serving his lord, he does not choose a task to undertake—this is loyalty. If he merely agrees with his lord’s words and approves of his deeds to fawn upon him, this is not true loyalty. Only when he neither flatters his parents nor fawns upon his lord does the heart of loyalty and filial piety reach its fullness—this is the peak of the subject’s virtue.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage and Abandoning Wisdom**\n\nDiscard the Sage and abandon wisdom, and the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong annotated: *\"The Dao aligns with nature, unified without mixture. Departing from the Dao to establish virtue is what is called sage-wisdom. When sage-wisdom stands, then the world first sees the conduct of arrogance, obscurity, fierceness, and eccentricity. Shocking the ignorant to reveal the filthy, praising Yao while condemning Jie—then the benefit of sage-wisdom to the world is little, while its harm is great. If one discards and abandons it, aligning with the Dao as one body, then each finds peace in their natural state and life’s essence. Its benefit is vast.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary states: *\"At the origin of reception, nature and the Dao are indistinct. After reception, nature and the Dao diverge. Only when indistinct with the Dao is there no distinction—this is the ‘Dao aligning with nature, unified without mixture.’ Only when diverging from the Dao are there boundaries—this is the ‘departing from the Dao to establish virtue, what is called sage-wisdom.’\"*\n\nAt the origin of nature, the subtle root is complete and whole. Sage and fool alike initially share no distinction. Those who depart from the Dao externally establish their virtue, losing the true and sinking into artifice, lost and never returning. Thus, the ignorant display wisdom, and the name of the Sage arises. When sage-wisdom stands, they cannot follow nature’s spontaneity, and the world first sees the conduct of arrogance, obscurity, fierceness, and eccentricity. Arrogance leads to excess; obscurity plunges into depth; fierceness defies reach; eccentricity stands apart—none are the conduct of simplicity and rectitude. Thus, they adorn wisdom to shock the ignorant, refine themselves to reveal the filthy, praise Yao while condemning Jie, yet they do not know to forget all and transform in the Dao. Then the benefit of sage-wisdom to the world is little, while its harm is great—this aligns with Zhuang Zhou’s words: *\"Do you delight in the Sage? Then you are like the man who admires a withered tree. Do you delight in wisdom? Then you are like the man who admires a blemish.\"*\n\nOnly when one knows to discard and abandon it, aligning with the Dao as one body, does one follow nature’s spontaneity and bring the world to governance through non-action. Only then does one find peace in their natural state and life’s essence. Truly, when the people return to simplicity and find peace in their nature and life, they align with the age and attain tranquility—can their benefit be calculated? Indeed, this is what is meant by *\"its benefit is vast.\"*\n\n**Discard Benevolence and Abandon Righteousness, and the People Return to Filial Piety and Kindness.**\n\nThe Emperor Huizong annotated: *\"Filial piety and kindness are innate nature. To hobble for benevolence, to tiptoe for righteousness—this is to replace nature with benevolence and righteousness. If one discards benevolence and abandons righteousness, the people will return to their nature and restore their origin, not merely loving their own parents, not merely cherishing their own children—what then is filial piety and kindness?\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary states: *\"All conduct stems from filial piety as its root; the three treasures prioritize kindness first. The heart of filial piety and kindness arises from innate nature, not from artificiality or external imposition. As for hobbling for benevolence—conduct is unnatural—and tiptoeing for righteousness—effort is forced—this is to replace nature with benevolence and righteousness. If one discards benevolence and abandons righteousness, the people’s nature will refine and return to virtue, virtue reaching back to its origin—this is returning to nature and restoring the beginning. If so, then the Great Dao is practiced, and the world is held in common: not merely loving one’s own parents, but extending care to all elders; not merely cherishing one’s own children, but nurturing all youth. Loving one another without knowing it as benevolence, uprightness without knowing it as righteousness—then filial piety and kindness belong to all, scarcely knowing why it is so.\"*\n\n**Discard Artifice and Abandon Gain, and Thieves and Robbers Will Cease.**\n\nThe Emperor Huizong annotated: *\"Those who practice cunning artifice have no shame. Those with desires for gain disregard righteousness. These are all of the ‘borrowed’ kind.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary states: *\"Without shame for vice, there is no way to know shame. Without knowing shame, there is no way to practice righteousness. For a person to be human, it is noble to act with shame and to prioritize righteousness when seeing gain. If one understands this, then one will not do what should not be done and will not desire what should not be desired, returning to the path of the gentleman. As for those who practice cunning artifice, their purity is incomplete, and the Dao does not record them—this is having no shame. As for those with desires for gain, they rely on benevolence while stepping on righteousness, counterfeit the true with the false—this is disregarding righteousness. Having no shame and disregarding righteousness, they do what should not be done and desire what should not be desired. Truly, few differ from those who take what is not theirs. This is why they are said to be of the ‘borrowed’ kind.\"*\n\nThese three principles—though insufficient as doctrine—are thus assigned their place.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong annotated: *\"The ancient kings governed the world through humanity. By the Zhou, refinement grew excessive, and by its decline, ornament overran substance, with ornament in excess while substance was insufficient. The world lost its original simplicity and sank into the habits of private desire. Laozi, in the late Zhou, sought to loosen these flaws and restore them to their root.

      "translated_text": "Was his heart truly convinced that the Seven Virtues of sage-wisdom were insufficient to govern the world? The Way of the ancient kings, like the cycle of seasons, returns again. To rely on refinement (*wén*), one must first establish substance (*zhì*), hence their proper place. This is what is meant by \"seeing the unadorned and embracing simplicity, reducing private desires and minimizing wants.\"\n\n**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**\nCold accumulates to become heat—not in a single day. Observing the rhythms of heaven to understand human affairs, we see that the ancient kings governed the world through humanity, progressing from simplicity to fullness, until by the Zhou, refinement grew excessive. At that time, institutions were established for every matter, and intricate regulations were set to guard against excess. Never was refinement more elaborate. Yet when refinement reaches its extreme, it leads to decay—substance is lost. There was too much emphasis on ornament while substance was insufficient, and the world lost its original simplicity, withering into falsehood. It sank into private desires and was obscured by petty wisdom—how could one not address this decay?\n\nLaozi, in the late Zhou, sought to ease these flaws and restore them to their root. His intent lay here. Thus, he discarded the Seven Virtues and returned to the natural state, abandoning ritual and learning to merge in Daoist practice—even sage-wisdom was rejected, no longer held in esteem. He wished the world to value the fundamental over the superficial, to loosen rigid adherence to the past. Was his heart truly convinced that benevolence and sage-wisdom were insufficient to govern the world?\n\nThe Xia emphasized loyalty, the Shang simplicity, and the Zhou refinement—sometimes adapting, sometimes revolutionizing, sometimes diminishing, sometimes adding. The Way of the ancient kings, like the seasons, returns in cycles. Yet when refinement falters, it must be restored by substance, just as summer returns to autumn. To rely on refinement, one must first establish substance—hence their proper place.\n\n**Seeing the Unadorned (*Jiànsù*):**\nEmperor Huizong annotated: *\"The Analects say: 'Painting begins with the blank canvas.' Before receiving color, the blank canvas is pure and unadorned.\"*\n**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**\nPainting begins with the blank canvas, hence the Analects say, *\"Painting begins with the blank canvas.\"* Before receiving color, the blank canvas is white. When color is applied, the original purity is obscured—this is the true nature of things. It is called *sù* because it remains unstained by external influences. To see the unadorned is to be clearly enlightened, without blemish, inwardly complete, and free from deceit—this is purity without admixture. This aligns with Zhuangzi’s *\"clear and entering the unadorned\"* and the idea that *sù* means unmixed.\n\n**Embracing Simplicity (*Bàopǔ*):**\nEmperor Huizong annotated: *\"The Classic says: 'The undifferentiated (*pǔ*) disperses to become things.' If the undifferentiated is not carved, embracing simplicity means stillness and unity without change.\"*\nZhuangzi said: *\"To align with desirelessness is called simplicity.\"* Simplicity restores the people’s true nature.\n\n**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**\nThings derive from simplicity as their root, hence the Classic says, *\"The undifferentiated disperses to become things.\"* If the undifferentiated is not carved, its form remains whole, untouched by artificial refinement. Simplicity is the true nature of things. It is called *pǔ* because it is uncarved, relying only on human artifice. To embrace simplicity is to be sincere and whole, returning to natural spontaneity, tranquil and at ease—this is stillness and unity without change. This aligns with Zhuangzi’s *\"pure and unbroken simplicity.\"* Thus, simplicity is the people’s natural state. Restoring this natural state means desirelessness, self-fulfillment, and aligning with Zhuangzi’s *\"to align with desirelessness is called simplicity.\"* Simplicity restores the people’s true nature.\n\n**Reducing Private Desires and Minimizing Wants (*Shǎosī-guǎyù*):**\nEmperor Huizong annotated: *\"Self-seeking is private; nothing nourishes the heart better than minimizing wants.\"*\nReducing private desires and minimizing wants clarifies the distinction between inner and outer, discerns true from false, preserves virtue whole, and restores true nature—thus the title of sage-wisdom fades.\n\n**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**\nTo be obscured by self-interest is to lose the greater harmony. Self-seeking is private. To be entangled in desires is to drown in agitation. Nothing nourishes the heart better than minimizing wants. Private desires and wants are external distractions, not inner reflections—they cultivate falsehood, not true nature. Only by reducing private desires and minimizing wants can one distinguish inner from outer, know what to value, discern true from false, preserve virtue uncorrupted, and restore true nature. Thus, in non-action and effortless action, the title of sage-wisdom vanishes—who then governs the world?\n\n**Chapter 20: \"Discarding Learning, There Is No Worry\" (*Juéxué-wúyōu*):**\nEmperor Huizong annotated: *\"Learning seeks to exhaust principles. While striving to exhaust principles through learning, how can one avoid worry over right and wrong, success and failure in governance?\"*\nLearning leads to the Dao. When one attains the Dao, learning is discarded—reducing further, reducing until non-action yet nothing remains undone. One follows the natural flow of life and nature, finding joy without end, thus free from worry.\n\n**Explanatory Notes (Cishu):**\n*Li* is like a boundary that can be measured; only through learning can one explore its depths. *Dao* is like a path all share; only by discarding learning can one reach its utmost.\n\nLearning seeks to exhaust principles—this is the beginning of learning, hence the Classic says, *\"In learning, there is daily increase.\"* While striving to exhaust principles through learning, one deliberates over right and wrong within the heart, examines governance through past and present—this is not yet free from the burden of thought. How can one avoid worry? Confucius worried about learning not being practiced—this is it.\n\nLearning leads to the Dao—this is the end of learning, hence the Classic says, *\"In the Dao, there is daily reduction.\"* When one attains the Dao and discards learning, limbs are discarded, senses are abandoned, form and knowledge are set aside, and all affairs vanish. Reducing further, reducing until nothing remains—then in non-action, yet nothing is left undone. Thus, motionless yet responsive, one follows the natural flow of life and nature, finding joy in forgetfulness, joy without end—thus free from worry.",

does not speak uniformly thus—\nsuppressing evil and promoting virtue, fearing it may not be thorough.\nWhat people fear, one cannot fail to fear—this is so.\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\nIf one merges the Dao with things, then distinctions arise from concealment.\nIf one divides things by the Dao, then distinctions arise from establishment.\nSpeaking from human inclination,\n*\"Unique\"* is reverence, *\"affirmative\"* is arrogance.\nGood lies in what is cherished, evil in what is despised—\nthis is inherently different.\n\nYet observing principle,\n*\"Unique\"* and *\"affirmative\"* emerge from one sound,\n*\"Good\"* and *\"evil\"* merge in one nature—\nwhat then distinguishes them?\n\nThe petty-wise, clinging to self, follow their emotions.\nFollowing emotion and self, each plants their own perspective,\narbitrarily drawing boundaries—\nthis is what is meant by *\"separating into two.\"*\n\nThe enlightened embrace principle.\nEmbracing principle to observe,\nthey

toward the world’s good and evil,\nhe does not remain indifferent—\nfor he does not wish to differ from the world.\n\nThus, when he emerges to govern,\nin ancestral temples and courts,\nhe readily distinguishes governance as his task;\nspeaking to lesser officers, he maintains harmonious discourse;\nspeaking to greater officers, he shows reverent deference.\nThus, he adapts to emotions through ritual,\nand through ritual distinguishes differences—\nhence his speech is not uniform.\n\nIf so, then evil is suppressed, virtue is exalted,\njudging the world’s right and wrong with impartiality,\ndemonstrating the world’s likes and dislikes—\nfearing it may not be thorough,\nhe takes heed of what people fear,\nand cannot fail to fear—\nbowing to align with them.\n\nWhat people fear, one cannot fail to fear.\nHuizong annotated:\n*\"The Dao stirs all things yet does not share the Sage’s worry.*\n*Calamity and fortune breathe with the people—this is governance.*\n*Those who embody the Dao have no worry;*\n*those who engage in affairs have reverence.\"*\n\nWhat people fear, yet failing to take warning,\nfew can avoid exhaustion.\nThus, the virtuous cultivate through awe

vigilance does one achieve reverence,\nand with diligent caution does one attain prudence—\nthen action will surely lead to auspiciousness,\nwithout fear of regret or hesitation.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *\"The virtuous cultivate through awe and reflection.\"*\nThe *Classic of Poetry* says: *\"Fear the might of Heaven.\"*\nThese are the utmost warnings.\n\nIndeed, cultivating through

and inexhaustible,*\n*without beginning or end—*\n*this is what is meant by ‘good and evil not yet settled.’*\n*Only the enlightened know they merge as one.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*\"The

Then its body leads while the body remains, and it withdraws its body while the body survives. Such bending is how it preserves its form and life without loss.\"*\n\nZhuangzi takes *\"yielding to things like a serpent’s wave\"* as the essential principle of vitality, and says: *\"The outwardly bent conforms to others as a disciple.\"* Only by bending outwardly does one not offend others’ sentiments—is this not *flexibility brings wholeness*?\n\n**Gunzezhi (Crookedness Brings Straightness):**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"When abandoned, one does not grieve; when confined, one does not lament—thus inwardly straight without losing its uprightness.\"*\n\nThe *Yi* says: *\"The inchworm’s bending is to seek its truth.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"When abandoned and left to perish, one should grieve yet does not; when confined and made destitute, one should lament yet does not. This seems like crookedness. Yet straightness without rigidity is how it preserves its straightness. Those who take accusation for straightness only harm their integrity. Such crookedness is what is called *straightening its uprightness*.\"*\n\nThe *Yi* says: *\"The inchworm’s bending is to seek its truth.\"* Indeed, bending is how it seeks its truth—is this not *crookedness brings straightness*?\n\n**Woxiying (Hollow Brings Fullness):**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Without hoarding, there is abundance.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"Hide mountains in marshes, boats in ravines, and they vanish without trace. Hide grain in困, water in vessels, and they are easily exhausted. Only by possessing what is within—able to move without accumulation—can one then use it, and it will overflow with abundance. This is what Zhuangzi means by *without hoarding, there is abundance*.\"*\n\nIllustrated by the nature of myriad things, *hollow brings fullness*—this is clear.\n\n**Biezixin (Exhaustion Brings Renewal):**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"If winter’s enclosure is not firm, spring’s growth will not flourish.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"Only by returning to root can one hope for its teeming. With the season of killing, one can hope for its flourishing. Only by storing in winter—firmly—can spring’s abundance necessarily thrive.\"* Illustrated by the cycles of the four seasons, *exhaustion brings renewal*—this is clear.\n\n**Shaozeduo (Fewness Brings Gain, Multitude Brings Confusion):**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The Dao’s essence is not in complexity; many words and sights are not as good as simplicity. If one takes branches for the essence, one will never comprehend—this is great confusion.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"The Dao is one and only. Thus its essence is not complex. Many words must be held with simplicity; many sights must be held with clarity. Only by having many words and sights yet returning to simplicity can one gain the Dao. If the learned are confined to branches as their essence, their speech will be exhausted, and they cannot avoid entanglement. Those in great confusion will never comprehend—are these not such people?\"*\n\nZhuangzi says: *\"The Dao does not desire mixture.\"* This is the same meaning.\n\nThus, the Sage embraces *Oneness* as the model for all under Heaven.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Its manifestation is not dual, so its creation of things is boundless. Only the utmost essence of the world can become the utmost spirit of the world. The Sage embraces Oneness to guard it, unshaken in its essence, so when speaking, it becomes the Dao for all under Heaven; when acting, it becomes the standard for all under Heaven.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"Only the utmost sincerity of the world can exhaust the nature of things. Exhausting the nature of things, one can assist Heaven and Earth in their nurturing transformation, participating with them. Its manifestation is not dual—this is sincerity. Its creation of things is boundless—this is assisting Heaven and Earth in their nurturing transformation. Only Oneness can preserve essence; only essence can gather spirit. What is this Oneness? It is sincerity itself. The penetration of Oneness’s essence ensures spirit’s preservation—essence precedes, and spirit follows. Only the utmost essence of the world can become the utmost spirit of the world. Embracing Oneness alone, the Sage exhausts this.\"*\n\nIf Oneness remains unchanging, guarding it without loss, then the utmost truth’s essence is internally preserved and not scattered. Thus, spirit and essence flow in all directions—upward reaching, downward curling—transforming and nurturing myriad things, beyond representation. When compelled to speak, speech forms patterns and all under Heaven follow. When compelled to act, action forms virtue and all under Heaven emulate it.\n\nAs the *Records* say: *\"When speaking, it becomes the Dao for all under Heaven; when acting, it becomes the standard for all under Heaven—this is the model for all under Heaven.\"*\n\n**Not seeing oneself, hence clarity:**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Not being obscured by one’s own views, it illuminates without bounds, hence clarity.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"With four eyes and four ears, broadening vision and hearing without obstruction, it can illuminate the farthest reaches and know people’s true sentiments. Not being obscured by one’s own views is how it can illuminate without bounds and be clear.\"*\n\n**Not insisting on oneself, hence brilliance:**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Not clinging to one’s own correctness, yet following what is correct, then great deeds and fame shine, and all under Heaven submit—hence brilliance.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"Consulting the many, abandoning self to follow others, not using oneself yet praising what is correct—thus achieving resplendent deeds and universal peace. Not clinging to one’s own correctness, yet following what is correct is how one achieves great deeds and fame, making all under Heaven submit and thus shining.\"*\n\n**Not praising oneself, hence merit:**\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The *Book of Documents* says: *You alone do not boast; none under Heaven will contend with you for merit.*\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: *\"The Classics say: *Those who praise themselves have no merit.* The *Book of Documents* says: *Having goodness, yet losing it.* Able not to boast of merit, so others do not contend, and its merit does not vanish.\"*",

The Sage’s responses are thus, enabling him to follow things’ crookedness while his straightness remains within, as said: ‘His responses align like a plumb line, following principle, yet never losing their straightness.’ Knowing that emptiness brings fullness, he thus attains great fullness like a void, humbly tending himself—what burden of excess? Knowing that decay brings renewal, he harmonizes his brilliance and waits in obscurity, never boasting—what trace of arrogance? All this is not a forced understanding of yielding and crookedness but a natural alignment, as if by instinct, emptying himself to respond, not clashing with things, merely attaining yielding. Thus, whole and returning, he can preserve his life without fear of peril, fulfill his years without fear of early death, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, enduring yet unaware of his end.

Thus, they neither augment life nor spur completion, yet all things flourish between Heaven and Earth—this is how they endure long.\n\nWhen gusts become relentless (*piāofēng*) and rains sudden (*zhòuyǔ*), yin and yang suffer discord and conflict. If one forces intervention, harm befalls the things—thus they cannot endure long.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nHeaven bestows, Earth generates—all things thrive together. Yet nothing disrupts life more swiftly than wind, nor nourishes it more deeply than water. Thus, the wind stirs and animates all forms, entrusting their transformation so that things may flourish freely; rain moistens and enriches all things, allowing them to grow luxuriant. It acts through natural course, not by augmenting life or aiding growth. Thus, life and transformation unfold in form and color between Heaven and Earth—this is the Way of enduring long.\n\nBut when wind grows fierce and swirling (*piāozhuǎn*), and rain gathers violently (*zhòujù*), this is not the harmony of yin and yang but the calamity of discord. To things, it brings augmentation and forced completion, not natural course—thus they suffer harm. How could such endure long?\n\nTherefore, those who follow the Dao:\n—Those aligned with the Dao are one with the Dao;\n—Those aligned with virtue are one with virtue;\n—Those aligned with loss are one with loss.\n\nThose aligned with the Dao gain the Dao;\nThose aligned with virtue gain virtue;\nThose aligned with loss gain loss.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nRarity (*xī*) means no external striving—beyond sound’s silence, awakening solely through innate awareness, merging with the Dao yet not entangled with things. How could virtue be named, or loss be burdened?\n\nOnly those unaware of the natural transformation of solitude mistake the Dao as difficult to know, difficult to practice—as if climbing to Heaven, beyond reach. Thus they labor mind and body in pursuit of the Dao, clinging to one-sidedness or obscured by narrowness, and the Dao is rent for all under Heaven.\n\nThose aligned with the Dao are one with the Dao,\nThose aligned with virtue are one with virtue,\nThose aligned with loss are one with loss—\nyet if they do not attain their own attainment,\nthen their attainment is itself a kind of loss.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nTo stand alone above all things, not laboring externally—this is rarity. Able to discard sharpness and wisdom, silently recognizing harmony in soundlessness, alone in hearing the true resonance—thus merging with the Dao, beyond pairing with things.\n\nWhen the Dao reaches this, there is neither gain nor loss—what virtue can be named, what loss can be burdened? The ignorant cannot dawn upon solitude, thus they do not know the natural transformation of solitude.\n\nThe Dao is inherently easy to know, yet none under Heaven knows it—thus it is deemed difficult to know.\nThe Dao is inherently easy to practice, yet none under Heaven practices it—thus it is deemed difficult to practice.\n\nSome seek the Dao in the distant heights, as if climbing to Heaven and unreachable, unaware that the lower one descends, the more it is attained—unconstrained by heights. Though their minds may fixate, straining their thoughts, or their skills may weary their bodies in pursuing the Dao—what could they attain?\n\nTo pursue it thus is to grasp one-sidedness in the Dao, to cling to narrowness in things—the Dao’s wholeness is thus fractured.\n\nMankind is born with inherent solitude, unchanging in nature, yet if they pursue the Dao, my so-called \"standing alone above all things\" is now subservient to the Dao. Though they attain virtue or loss in three degrees, it is not their own attainment—only converging in loss.\n\nFaith is insufficient, thus there is doubt.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nFaith means no deception. Deception arises from true and false—if one takes the Dao as true and things as false, then faith is insufficient, and doubt arises. The disciples of Hui Shi and Han Fei all strayed far from the Dao because of insufficient faith.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nThe Classic says: *\"The trustworthy, I trust; the untrustworthy, I also trust—this is true trust.\"* Though all things differ, none are without substance. To regard the untrustworthy as trustworthy is true trust.\n\nOnly those who know the Dao does not contradict things, yet do not take the Dao as true knowledge, nor things as false—thus there is nowhere without trust.\n\nBut those with insufficient faith arise from delusion, taking the Dao as true and things as false, unaware of the whole, and thus generate distinctions. Hence, those with insufficient faith also have doubt.\n\nLike Hui Shi’s love of paradoxes, Han Fei’s rigid legalism—unaware that true and false merge in unity, and those who separate them stray far from the Dao—all because of insufficient faith.\n\n**End of *Dao Xuē Zhēn Jīng* Exegesis, Volume Five** #1: *\"Then then\"*—likely a scribal error.\n**Volume Six of *Moral Virtue True Classic* Exegesis**\nBy the Imperial Scholar Jiang Cheng’s Commentary.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twenty-Four: \"The Unsteady Cannot Stand\"**\n\nThe unsteady cannot stand; the overreaching cannot move.\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: To stand while unsteady, to move while overreaching—these defy nature’s norm, yet hope for bodily ease. How difficult!\n\nIf one follows *virtue/power* as their guide, then all who have sufficient grounding will arrive.\nThe Exegesis says: The unsteady leans but does not stand firm, yet still they cannot doubt that standing is possible. The overreaching strides but does not hasten, yet still they cannot doubt that they can move with ease. To stand while unsteady, to move while overreaching—these are those who cannot rest in tranquility, cannot align with nature, and thus cannot cease. To defy nature’s norm, yet hope for bodily ease, how difficult!\n\nOnly those who *follow their nature* and find self-sufficiency, who take *virtue/power* as their guide, and do not force or distort things as false—only these will arrive where they have sufficient grounding. Like the childless *Master Shushan* and *Wang Dai*, who lacked feet yet reached everywhere.\n\nThose who see only themselves are not enlightened; those who insist on their own correctness do not shine; those who boast of their own merits have no true accomplishment; those who pride themselves in their abilities do not endure.\nIn the Dao, this is called *excessive consumption* and *superfluous action*.\n\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: Self-perception leads to insufficient wisdom to encompass all things, hence lack of enlightenment. Insisting on one’s own correctness means *virtue/power* is insufficient to harmonize with the multitude, hence lack of brilliance. They possess merit, yet lose it; they boast of their abilities, yet lose their efficacy. Where the Dao resides, it takes *depth* as its root and *simplicity* as its measure. Excessive display and lustful ambition—how could these be the Dao?\n\nThus, in eating, it is called *excess*; in action, it is called *superfluous*. Both are external adornments, not intrinsic.\nSome may detest them, hence the Daoist does not dwell there.\n\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: Luxury beyond nature leads to excess, which is what the heavens lack, the earth transforms, and people abhor. Hence, the Daoist does not dwell there.\n\nThe Exegesis says: The Dao of heaven lacks excess and instead fosters humility; the Dao of earth transforms excess into humility; the Dao of humanity abhors excess and cherishes humility. If one indulges in excessive display and lustful ambition, they are luxuriating beyond nature and filling themselves with excess. They should be what the heavens lack, the earth transforms, and people abhor. The Sage does not so. They always present *gentleness, weakness, humility, and modesty* as their outward form. Those who do not know that fullness brings burden and excess strains nature, yet indulge in self-swelling, should be what the Daoist does not dwell in.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: \"The Formless Mixture\"**\n\nThere is a formless mixture that arises before heaven and earth.\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: *Qi* and form are complete yet undifferentiated—this is *primordial chaos*. To merge with *primordial chaos* means their completion is unmarred. This is what the *Yijing* calls the *Great Polarity*. Heaven and earth also depend on this before they arise, hence it is said to arise before heaven and earth. Yet it is not the ineffable mystery of non-arising, hence it is called *thing*.\n\nThe Exegesis says: *Great Beginning* is the origin of *qi*; *Great Purity* is the origin of form. Before these three are differentiated, they are called *primordial chaos*. In the initial state of *primordial chaos*, the *Great Uncarved* has not yet dispersed—this is what the *Yijing* calls the *Great Polarity*. Thus, to merge with *primordial chaos* means their completion is unmarred. The *Yijing* has the *Great Polarity*, which gives rise to the *Two Principles*. The *Great Polarity* is the source from which the *Two Principles* emerge, hence heaven and earth depend on it to arise. To enter *non-arising*, then *qi* is undifferentiated and *primordial chaos* is merged in the ineffable profundity. To descend into *arising*, then the light and clear separate from the heavy and turbid, manifesting in forms. Arising—how could this be the ineffable profundity of non-arising? It is called *thing*, and this is its proper designation.\n\nSilent and boundless,\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: Silent and boundless means it does not engage in movement, nor does it interact with things. It is pure and complete in itself.\n\nThe Exegesis says: Silent and unmoving means the silent has never engaged in movement. *Great Emptiness* is boundless and vast, meaning the boundless has never interacted with things. Not engaging in movement, not interacting with things—then it has no sound, no scent, pure and complete in itself.\n\nIndependent yet unchanging,\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: Great constancy sustains it, unyielding to transformation—this speaks to the Dao’s essence.\n\nThe Exegesis says: From its own root and foundation, ancient and unshaken, nothing can topple it, no change can displace it. This is called *great constancy sustaining it*. If so, then all transformations are boundless, yet the Dao remains ever the same. Is this not the Dao’s essence?\n\nCirculating endlessly without exhaustion,\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: It benefits all things in their arising and passing, moving ceaselessly—this speaks to the Dao’s function.\n\nThe Exegesis says: When things arise, it arises with them; when things pass, it passes with them. All people rely on it, and wherever it goes, it endures. This is called *benefiting all things in their arising and passing*. If so, then in every arising and passing, yet it is always inexhaustible. Is this not the Dao’s function?\n\nIt can be the mother of all under heaven.\n*Huizong*’s Annotation: All things depend on it for their arising.",
      "overlap_context": ", unaware of the whole, and thus generate distinctions. Hence, those with insufficient faith also have doubt.\n\nLike Hui Shi’s love of paradoxes, Han Fei’s rigid legalism—unaware that true and false merge in unity, and those who separate them stray far from the Dao—all because of insufficient faith.\n\n**End of *Dao Xuē Zhēn Jīng* Exegesis, Volume Five** #1: *\"Then then\"*—likely a scribal error.\n**Volume Six of *Moral Virtue True Classic* Exegesis**\nBy the Imperial Scholar Jiang Cheng’s Commentary.",

      "translated_text": "The Exegesis says: That which is born cannot give birth to itself—only that which does not itself arise can give birth to all things. Therefore, all things must rely upon the Dao to arise. The Classic says: *\"All things depend upon it to arise, yet it does not decline.\"* It also says: *\"The world has a beginning, and it is called the Mother of the world.\"* I do not know its name, so I call it *Dao*, and forcefully name it thus.\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Things arise, and only then do they take form; they take form, and only then do they flourish; they flourish, and only then do they take measure. Names arise from reality, and reality has its measure—thus, naming is but the flourishing. The Dao is ever nameless, so when we name it with the greatest term, it is in contrast to the lesser. Thus, it can be named.\n\nThe Dao’s subtlety is small and profound; the Dao’s centrality is great and manifest.\n*The Exegesis says:* Left Scholar says: Things arise, and only then do they take form; they take form, and only then do they flourish; they flourish, and only then do they take measure. Things arise with water—water gathers and flourishes, this is flourishing. That which can be gathered into clusters, dispersed into branches, this is measure. Flourishing is the preliminary appearance of measure, before it congeals into form. Measure is the completed flourishing, fixed within a solid body. When things are formed and their measure is set, their abundance or scarcity becomes apparent—this is where names arise. Thus, names arise from reality, and reality has its measure.\n\nNaming and giving it a childlike designation—this is the meaning of naming, so naming is but flourishing. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the Dao generates heaven and earth, so the Dao is ever nameless. The subtlest of subtleties, the most vast of vastness—thus, the great is the contrast to the small. The nameless is the Dao’s subtlety; the Dao’s subtlety is small and profound, hence this. Therefore, naming it as great is the Dao’s centrality; the Dao’s centrality is great and manifest, hence this. Thus, it can be named.\n\nWhen manifest in the utmost transformation, it is great and interacts with all things. When returning to the utmost profundity, it is small and distinguishes itself from all things. Only in its interaction with all things can it be named as great—covering and nurturing all things, viewing them equally with benevolence, encompassing all without distinction. Only in its distinction from all things can it be named as small—action through stillness, creation through repose, returning to its Dao without departing from its nature.\n\nWhen interacting with all things, it is as the *Classic* says: *\"In speaking of the far, it is unconstrained.\"* When distinguishing itself from all things, it is as the *Classic* says: *\"In speaking of the near, it is still and correct.\"* The Dao’s distance from its root is far—its departure runs without pause, responds without exhaustion. Far, it is unconstrained—is this not the time of its interaction with all things? The Dao’s return to its root is near—it returns to its root in stillness, stillness as returning to its command. Near, it is still and correct—is this not the time of its distinction from all things?\n\nThus, the Dao is great; heaven is great; earth is great; the Sage-King is great.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* The Dao covers and nurtures heaven and earth. Heaven covers all without exception; earth bears all without omission. The Sage-King occupies the central position between heaven and earth, aligning with them—thus, he too is great.\n\n*The Exegesis says:* The Dao precedes the Supreme Ultimate yet is not lofty; it lies beneath the Six Extremes yet is not deep. As Liezi says: *\"Beyond heaven and earth, there is no greater heaven and earth.\"* Thus, the Dao can cover and nurture heaven and earth. The light and pure gather above as heaven—when its expanse is boundless, stars and all things are without exception covered. The heavy and turbid settle below as earth—when its breadth and depth are vast, mountains and seas are without omission borne. The Sage-King embodies this, positioned within, harmonizing the Three Powers with mutual communication, distinguishing the Three Extremes with their own essences. Thus, he can emulate heaven and earth within himself. This is why the four great things within the realm are so.\n\nYet, though not inherently great, they are ranked as great—still not departing from form. From the Supreme One, divided into four—still not departing from measure. Though having form yet not obstructed by form, though having measure yet not constrained by measure—this is how it is great.\n\nWithin the realm, there are four great things, and the Sage-King occupies one of them.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Descending from the Dao, there are square forms—thus, it is called the realm.

      "translated_text": "Thus, he shares the same essence as the Dao, the same function as heaven and earth, yet is still called great. *Cushiyi* says: Before the Dao descends, it is unified in the boundless void with no division, hence the earlier reference to the \"mixed and complete Dao.\" Once dispersed, it is confined within square forms and thus visible, hence the current mention of the \"realm.\"\n\nThe square form does not depart from the original essence of the Heavenly Dao—this is why it is said to be still and sagely. When it manifests in the rise of the Sage-King, this is why it is said to be active and kingly. Only when one transitions from stillness to action, from sagely virtue to kingly power, can he harmonize the Three Powers and fulfill the ultimate extent of human conduct.\n\nAs for the Sage-King’s undertakings and achievements, one who surpasses others in this is the king. One who surpasses others in this is akin to heaven, for the king’s capacity to fulfill human conduct is the same as heaven’s. The *Sutra* states: \"The king is heaven.\" Is this not the Dao’s utmost perfection?\n\nWithin the realm, the four great things are thus, and the Sage-King resides in one of them. Now, the Dao is hidden and nameless—only he who dwells with it can comprehend it. Since he shares the same essence as the Dao, and heaven and earth establish their positions, while the Sage-King perfects his abilities, they all share the same function. Thus, the Dao, heaven and earth, and the Sage-King all originate from the same source, unified and harmonized, fulfilling human conduct to become one with heaven, embodying heaven to become one with the Dao—there is no distinction to be observed.\n\nHumans follow the earth, the earth follows the heavens, the heavens follow the Dao, and the Dao follows *ziran* [自然].\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Humans refer to the Sage-King. The heavens do not act yet all things transform; the earth does not grow yet all things nurture. The Sage-King acts without effort yet achieves the world’s prosperity—what he follows is the Dao’s *ziran* alone.\n\nThe Dao follows *ziran* because it responds to things. *Ziran* is not the Dao in its entirety, but when it emerges to respond to things, the Dao descends to follow it as well.\n*Cushiyi* says: Earlier, it was said that the Dao is great, the heavens are great, the earth is great, and the Sage-King is also great. Here, it is said that humans follow the earth—thus, it is known that \"humans\" refers to the Sage-King.\n\nThe heavens act without effort, yet remain clear; they allow all things to flourish naturally, thus not \"producing\" yet all things transform—this is the divine essence of the heavens. The earth acts without effort, yet remains tranquil; it entrusts all forms to their own growth, thus not \"lengthening\" yet all things are nurtured—this is the richness of the earth. Above, the Sage-King must act without effort to govern the world; below, he must act with purpose for the world’s benefit. To govern without effort yet achieve the world’s prosperity—this is the greatness of the Sage-King. These three principles are all derived from following the Dao’s *ziran*.\n\nIndeed, humans do not fail to follow the heavens, yet it is said they follow the earth; the earth does not fail to follow the Dao, yet it is said to follow the heavens. This is because when speaking of the Dao, there must be an order. Ultimately, all originate from *ziran*—thus, it concludes with \"the Dao follows *ziran*.\"\n\nEven if discussing things, *ziran* is above them; if not discussing things, *ziran* is below them. From *ziran* arises the other, and from *ziran* comes extinction—*ziran* is not the Dao in its entirety. Yet the Dao follows it, emerging to respond to things, and thus its following is a descent to lower realms.\nZhuangzi said: \"To respond in accordance with *ziran*—this is the Dao.\"\nIs this not what is meant?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as the Light’s Root, Stillness as the Lord of Agitation**\nThe heavy serves as the root of the light, stillness as the lord of agitation. Thus, the virtuous one walks all day without straying from his burden.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* The heavy does not sway or be stolen away, yet remains steadfast—thus, it serves as the root of the light. The still does not move recklessly, yet maintains control—thus, it lords over agitation.\n\nWith stillness and heaviness to sustain oneself, few will lose their way. The virtuous one walks all day without straying from his burden—thus, though he treads cautiously, he fears no mishap.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: Yang Xiong said: \"Take the four heavy things.\" Heavy means one does not grow light. The *Sutra* states: \"Hold steadfast to stillness.\" Stillness means one does not falter. Only when one does not grow light can things not displace him, and his center remains unshaken—thus, he is not swayed or stolen away, yet remains steadfast. Only when one does not falter can he not rush forward recklessly, yet respond to all movements—thus, he is not moved recklessly, yet maintains control.\n\nHeaviness with steadfastness is why it serves as the root of the light;\nStillness with control is why it lords over agitation.\nTo be able to guard oneself with stillness means all movements cannot displace;\nTo be able to sustain oneself with heaviness means external things cannot overwhelm.\nFew will lose their way—this is indeed his nature.\n\nAll things in motion have burdens; thus, they are heavy and slow. Without burdens, they are light and swift.\nMovement is swift when light, yet it must rely on burdens to sustain itself. Though he treads cautiously, he fears no midway困 [困], hence no mishap.\n\nThough there are grand spectacles, he must first attain tranquil repose to rise above them.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Grand spectacles belong to things; tranquil repose belongs to the self. Only when the self is at ease can one enjoy the things around him.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: Zhuangzi said: \"When colors are paired, the five hues are disordered, and intricate patterns scatter the pure and the yellow in dazzling confusion.\" This is why grand spectacles belong to things. Mencius said: \"The four limbs are for ease and repose.\" This is why tranquil repose belongs to the self. King Wen of Zhou, in his leisure, first ascended to the shore—his body was at ease, and then the pleasures of the terrace and pond appeared in his spirit. Only when the body is at ease can one enjoy things—this is evident here. Thus, though there are grand spectacles, one must first attain tranquil repose to rise above them.\n\nHow can a ruler of ten thousand chariots govern the world with a light heart?\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* The world is a great thing. To have great things is to be solemn, as if driving six horses with a rotting rein—thus, one cannot govern the world with a light heart.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: To act without effort and commit few faults is easy; to act with purpose yet bear no burdens is difficult. Can one who governs the world easily undertake such deeds? Yu praised Yao, saying, \"Only the Emperor finds it difficult,\" and Tang said of himself, \"I tremble with fear and anxiety.\" All who act with purpose find it difficult because of the burden of not being without effort. Thus, to have great things, one must be solemn as if driving six horses with a rotting rein—thus, one cannot govern the world with a light heart.",

      "translated_text": "Lightness leads to losing one’s ministers, haste leads to losing one’s subjects.\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* If one does not weigh actions solemnly, there will be no authority, hence one loses one’s ministers. If one does not lead but merely harmonizes, one transgresses proper distinctions, hence one loses one’s subjects.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: A dignified bearing naturally commands respect—this is the way of things. Without such weight, there is no authority. The ruler holds supreme dignity while ministers are lowly; only the ruler’s dignity matters, so one must not act lightly.\n\nThe ruler initiates, the ministers follow—this is the natural order. If the ruler does not lead yet the ministers harmonize, they overstep their roles. The ruler must act first, so one must not be hasty.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Virtue of Benevolent Conduct**\nBenevolent conduct leaves no trace.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* What is preserved is the Dao, what is manifested is transformation—thus, no trace remains.\n*Cushiyi* says: The Dao is formless and boundless, yet it abides in harmony. Thus, what is preserved is the Dao. Transformation arises through the shifting of forms and is subject to traces—thus, what is manifested is transformation. Those who dwell in the Dao preserve without seeking, while those who dwell in traces pass through without guarding their steps. Such conduct should leave no trace behind.\n\nBenevolent words bear no flaws or reproach.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* In harmony with the Dao’s natural flow, unfolding without constraint—thus, no flaws or reproach remain.\nWords and deeds are grand in scope: they begin with contemplation and end in transformation. Only the Sage can perfect words and deeds, achieving the marvel of transformation—thus, benevolent conduct leaves no trace to follow, and benevolent words bear no reproach to burden.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: *Tianni* refers to the origin of nature and life. *Manyan* refers to boundless change. If one aligns with the origin of nature and life, and follows with boundless change, then words spoken may endure all day, and words spoken may exhaust the Dao. Such words should bear no reproach.\n\nMoreover, considering the *Yijing*:*\nThe *xiang* are the most refined patterns of the world—gentlefolk emulate them in speech.\nThe *yao* are the most dynamic forces of the world—gentlefolk act in accordance with them.\n\nWords and deeds rest with humanity, while transformation belongs to Heaven and Earth.\nWords and deeds begin with contemplation and end in transformation—thus, words and deeds are the pivot and mechanism of the gentlefolk.\n\nOnly the Sage comprehends the essence of words, making them the foundation of conduct. With such words, one can respond to distant affairs as if at hand, and govern the movement of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe marvel of transformation is complete within oneself. If one acts thus, then conduct leaves no trace—coming and going alone, following only the grand Dao. What trace could there be?\n\nIf one speaks thus, then words conform to the law, set forth with divine intent, bearing no stain. What reproach could burden?\n\nBenevolent planning does not rely on calculations.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* To grasp unity is to master all things—what need for numbers? Thus, calculations are unnecessary, yet myriad changes unfold as if counted one by one.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: To know unity is to know all things, for all things in the world arise from unity. To grasp unity is to complete all affairs. Once one has achieved unity, one transcends numbers. To transcend numbers yet generate them is even more wondrous—how much more so to not rely on numbers yet bring them forth? It is fitting that no calculations are needed, for myriad changes, though seemingly countless, unfold as if counted one by two.\n\nBenevolent closure requires no bolts or bars yet cannot be opened.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Sealing the path guards the Dao, retreat hides in profound mystery.\n\n*Cushiyi* says: Closing the mouth and sealing the gate, one holds fast to the Dao’s essence—none can alter its truth. *Tunna* guards the Dao thus. Zhuangzi said: \"Without seeing or hearing, embracing the Dao in stillness—this is near the mark.\" The small mound and deep roots, the hidden position and concealed boundaries, yet the world cannot perceive its traces. Retreat hides in profound mystery—Zhuangzi said: \"Hidden in the measureless rhythms of the Dao—this is near the mark.\" If one abides thus, though no bolts or bars are used, who could open it? This is called benevolent closure.\n\nBenevolent binding requires no cords or fetters yet cannot be undone.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* To depend on cords and fetters for binding is to diminish one’s nature. Some do not speak yet nourish others with harmony; they stand alongside others yet transform them—binding without cords, who could undo it?\n\n*Cushiyi* says: The world has its constants—one’s true nature is the origin, born with life, steadfast and unyielding. Why depend on cords and fetters for binding? To depend on cords and fetters is to harm one’s true nature and scatter one’s purity—thus, it diminishes one’s nature. The benevolent binder does not act thus: they water others’ hearts with perfect harmony, needing no words. They align with the Dao’s essence, causing others’ intentions to dissolve without relying on force. This is Zhuangzi’s meaning: \"Some do not speak yet nourish others with harmony; they stand alongside others yet transform them\"—precisely this.\n\nIf so, then attachment and separation do not require glue or lacquer, and bonds do not require ropes or knots. Who could undo it?\n\nThus, the Sage always benevolently rescues people, so none are abandoned.\nThe Sage always benevolently rescues things, so none are abandoned.\n\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Benevolence is the continuation of the Dao. To abide in the Dao is to transcend named benevolence. Once benevolence is named, the Dao emerges and the world is transformed. The Sage embodies the Dao to benefit the world—thus, these five benevolences extend to people and things without abandoning any.\n\nYet the Sage’s way of loving people and benefiting things, allowing them to flourish and for humanity to rejoice in their nature, is not a matter of intention. It is to return to their constant state, following the Dao’s natural flow.\n\nThe world has lost the Dao. All under Heaven have abandoned their tranquil, solemn, still, and vast nature, and daily sink into the realm of suffering. Who but the Sage can save them?\n\n*Cushiyi* says: The *Yijing* says: \"One yin and one yang—the Dao. To continue it is benevolence.\" Thus, benevolence is the continuation of the Dao, returning to the origin of the Great Dao. Then, benevolence and evil are merely distinctions that cannot be fully separated—thus, there is no named benevolence.",

      "translated_text": "When benevolence is sung of as a virtue to be celebrated, it is rooted in the Dao, and thus its goodness encompasses all under Heaven—this is how the name of benevolence is established.\n\nFrom virtuous deeds to perfect harmony, the Sage’s five benevolences extend without abandoning any, for they embody the ability to embody the Dao and thereby save all under Heaven.\n\nThe Sage loves and rescues people, letting them rejoice in life, and benefits and rescues things, letting them fulfill their nature—what need is there for deliberate intent? Returning to the One without trace, following the Dao without deviation, conforming to their natural state, riding the rites without obstruction, and letting all things fulfill their roles while the people govern themselves—this is all.\n\nYet if not for such a person, the Dao cannot act in vain, nor can it flourish in the world. Thus, the people lose their tranquil, solemn, still, and vast nature, becoming confined and chaotic, weary and burdened, daily sinking into the realm of suffering. Without one to nurture and guide them, how can they avoid corrupting their nature or straying from their virtue?\n\nIt is not the duty of those who teach and transform to bear the weight of the world with the Dao, to bring forth the Dao and benefit the world, so that the people and things may each find peace in their natural essence—who else could achieve the function of perfect benevolence and salvation?\n\nThis is called *clothing in brightness* (袭明).\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** *Clothing* means to reveal without display.\nClothing in brightness shines yet does not dazzle.\n\n**Explication:** The dragon, as a creature, can be seen and can hide. *Clothing* means to hide while not yet revealed. Because it hides, when its scales are within, *clothing* carries the meaning of revealing without display—akin to the *clothing* in *\"inciting and clothing\"* (惕袭) that does not follow sequentially.\n\nClothing in brightness removes the slippery doubt of dazzling and the scheming brilliance of form, for it does not flaunt its own light. The Sage’s way in the world is to be a boundless source of wisdom, yet outwardly appears dim—this is why it is so.\n\nThus, the virtuous person is the teacher of the unvirtuous; the unvirtuous person is the resource of the virtuous.\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** *Resource* speaks to its utility—only when there is unvirtue does one recognize the utility of virtue.\n\n**Explication:** All paths of utility can be transformed into wealth or used as bribes, but *resource* refers to secondary utility. Thus, *resource* speaks to utility, showing that when virtue is evident, one must preserve it, and when unvirtue appears, one must reflect upon it. Only then, with the existence of the unvirtuous, does the function and utility of the virtuous become apparent—this is why the unvirtuous serve as the resource of the virtuous.\n\nConfucius said: *\"When three men walk together, there is surely one who can be my teacher. I select his good qualities and follow them; I select his bad qualities and change them.\"* This is the same meaning.\n\nYet the Sage does not prize his teacher nor cherish his resource.\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** When all under Heaven know virtue as virtue, then unvirtue already exists. Virtue and unvirtue are both forgotten—there is no room for deliberate intent, so what is there to prize or cherish? This is how the Sage achieves great harmony with all things.\n\n**Explication:** In discussing the nature of things, virtue and unvirtue are unified. From the perspective of ordinary people, there is virtue, with unvirtue as its opposite. From the Sage’s perspective, both virtue and unvirtue are embraced—his heart is empty, with no preference or rejection. What is there to prize in the teacher of the unvirtuous? What is there to cherish in the resource of the virtuous? They are indistinct, forgotten, and transformed in the Dao.\n\nKnowing that the distinction between virtue and evil arises from delusion, why would one cling to fine distinctions and generate the heart of prizing or cherishing?\n\nGreat harmony with all things is seen in the Sage.\nEven the wise are utterly confused—this is called *the essential mystery* (要妙).\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** The essential mystery of the Dao lies in not perceiving the multitude of virtues, having no use for wisdom. The Seven Sages were all confused, with no path to inquire about. The meaning aligns here.\n\n**Explication:** Virtue is a deviation from the Dao; wisdom arises from the Dao’s manifestation. The essential mystery of the Dao merges virtue and evil into unity, so one does not perceive the multitude of virtues to seek them with wisdom, nor does one have any use for wisdom. Difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom, difficult to measure or recognize—this is not the realm of cleverness or daring. This is why they are utterly confused.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor was about to meet the Great Spirit (大魄) at Mount Jutzi (具茨之山), arriving at the wilds of Xiangcheng (襄城之野), where the followers of Fangming and Huaji (方明滑稽之徒) led the Seven Sages astray, leaving them utterly lost, with no path to ask. The Great Spirit is a metaphor for the essential mystery of the Dao; the Seven Sages are a metaphor for those not free from using wisdom.\n\nThe Seven Sages were all confused, with no path to ask—this demonstrates that the essential mystery of the Dao cannot be known through wisdom. The writings of Zhuang Zhou complement those of Laozi, evident here.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Heroic**\nKnow the heroic, yet hold to the yielding—\nThus you become the valley of all under Heaven.\nAs the valley of all under Heaven,\nYour constant virtue never departs,\nReturning to the infant.\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** The heroic is the strong overcoming things; the yielding is gentle and still. The Sage’s wisdom knows how to overcome things, yet he himself dwells in gentleness and stillness. All things come to him, drawing from him without depletion—thus he is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nThe valley is low, and flowing water rushes toward it—\nThis is to hold without force, yet sustain with humility,\nSo that virtue and nature remain forever united—\nThis is called *constant virtue*, returning to the infant.\nQi is harmonious yet not violent;\nNature is pure yet undispersed—\nThis is the infant.\nMencius said: *\"The noble person does not lose the heart of the infant.\"*\n\n**Explication:** The heroic is the yang, firm in body and riding upon things, thus able to overcome them with strength. The yielding is the yin, gentle in body and receiving things, thus only gentle and still.\n\nThe Sage’s wisdom can awe the world and move the heavens and earth—this is knowing how to overcome things, which is called *knowing the heroic*.",

      "translated_text": "Though firm in strength, he must yet be hidden and abide in gentleness;\nThough active in motion, he must yet be profound and abide in stillness—\nThus he is able to preserve the yielding.\n\nOnly by abiding in gentleness can he never be severed from things;\nOnly by abiding in stillness can he suffice to respond to all movement.\nWhen he gives to others as he does to himself, his virtue overflows abundantly,\nNever exhausted—\nThis is how he becomes the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nMoreover, the earth does not fill the east and south,\nSo all rivers and floods return to it—\nThus the valley, being low, is rightly where flowing water rushes.\n\nThe Sage preserves the yielding with gentleness and stillness,\nReceiving all things without refusal.\n\nThough the heroic involves firmness and overcoming with strength,\nAnd the yielding involves humility and overcoming with gentleness—\nThe Sage, when firm, remains submerged and hidden,\nThus he does not employ strength;\nWhen yielding, he establishes his foundation,\nThus he sustains it with humility.\n\nNot employing strength yet sustaining with humility—\nThis is truly knowing the heroic while preserving the yielding.\n\nVirtue arises from nature, originally never separated—\nIf one leans solely toward the heroic, harmony is consumed;\nIf one leans solely toward the yielding, there is nothing to establish.\nOnly by knowing the heroic while possessing firmness,\nAnd preserving the yielding while completing with gentleness—\nCan one achieve the refinement of harmony,\nFilling all that is natural,\nAnd thus the Sage’s virtue is complete—\nWhat difference is there between him and the infant?\n\nFor the infant’s qi is focused and his will is singular,\nThus he is harmonious yet not violent;\nHis desires and thoughts are not yet fully formed,\nThus he is pure yet undispersed—\nOnly when virtue and nature are forever united\nDoes he return to the infant.\n\nAs Mencius said: *\"The noble person does not lose the heart of the infant.\"*\n\nKnowing the bright, guarding the dark—\nThis is the model for all under Heaven.\n\nTo be the model for all under Heaven,\nHis constant virtue never errs,\nReturning to the Boundless.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nBrightness symbolizes virtue manifesting;\nDarkness symbolizes the Way returning.\nThe Sage reveals his luminous virtue,\nYet silently unites with the Way—\nWithout flaw, he is the standard for all under Heaven.\n\nHis joy is extended without exhaustion,\nThus he is the model for all under Heaven.\n\nHe is upright yet not arbitrary,\nTrustworthy as the four seasons,\nNever deviating—\nSuch as this, difficult to exhaust, without end,\nNever reaching an extreme—\nThus it is said: *constant virtue never errs, returning to the Boundless.*\n\nThe *Book of Documents*, in *The Grand Pivot*, speaks of the Kingly Way:\n*\"Return to its having an extreme.\"*\nLaozi speaks of being the model for all under Heaven:\n*\"Return to the Boundless.\"*\n\nExtreme means *the central way*.\nHaving an extreme refers to virtue manifesting in deeds,\nWhere centrality is the utmost.\nThe Boundless refers to virtue returning to the Way,\nWhich cannot be attained.\n\n**Explication:**\nBrightness is the center of yin, corresponding to the west,\nThe place where all treasures are completed—\nThus it symbolizes virtue manifesting.\nDarkness explores its origin, corresponding to the north,\nThe time when all things return to their root—\nThus it symbolizes the Way returning.\n\nThe Sage emits the radiance of Heaven,\nIlluminating the lower lands—\nThus his revealed virtue is the singular nature—\nThis is knowing the bright.\nRetreating and hiding in seclusion,\nNot revealing his essence—\nThus his silent unity is rooted in the Way—\nThis is guarding the dark.\n\nWith virtue and the Way fully complete,\nWithout flaw,\nHe is the standard for all under Heaven—\nHis example is followed, and all under Heaven conforms.\nWithout thought, all submit;\nHis joy is extended in his time,\nHis abundant virtue is unforgettable,\nNot exhausted by the ages—\nThus he is the model for all under Heaven.\n\nOnly by being the model for all under Heaven\nDoes his uprightness remain unchanging and unshifting,\nHis timing follow naturally and inevitably.\n\nUpright yet never erring,\nHe never acts arbitrarily—\nNot expecting as he does,\nThe four seasons’ virtue reaches this—\nWhat deviation could there be?\n\nSuch as this, the origin of true essence aligns with Heaven’s order—\nWho can fathom its end?\nWho can exhaust its limits?\n\nTruly, all transformations have no end—\nThis is why it is said: *constant virtue never errs.*\n\nAlthough the *Book of Documents*, in *The Grand Pivot*, speaks of the Kingly Way:\n*\"Return to its having an extreme,\"*\nAnd Laozi speaks of being the model for all under Heaven:\n*\"Return to the Boundless,\"*\nWhy is this so?\n\nThe *Grand Pivot* was composed by Ji Zi to elucidate the subtleties of the Way,\nWhile the *Dao De Jing* was written by Laozi to reveal the Way’s brilliance.\n\nTo elucidate the Way is to take the central harmony as the foundation,\nThus it is said: *having an extreme.*\nFor virtue manifesting in deeds,\nCentrality is the utmost.\n\nTo reveal the Way is to take the utmost clarity as the foundation,\nThus it is said: *the Boundless.*\nFor virtue returning to the Way,\nIt cannot be attained.\n\nExtreme means *the central way*,\nLike the ridgepole of a house, where all beams converge,\nLike the celestial pole, where all stars gather.\nWhether present or absent,\nEach has its proper place.\n\nKnowing the honored, guarding the humble—\nThis is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nTo be the valley of all under Heaven,\nHis constant virtue is complete,\nReturning to the Uncarved.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nBeyond nature and life, there is nothing but things.\nCommon people regard gain as honored, loss as humble,\nAbundance as honored, restraint as humble.\nOnly the Sage can view honor and humiliation equally,\nWithout preference or rejection.\n\nYet he does not aspire to extravagance,\nBut takes restraint as his measure—\nThis is emptiness alone,\nThus he is the valley of all under Heaven.\n\nThe valley is empty yet able to receive,\nResponding without storing—\nWhen virtue reaches this, it is complete and exhaustive,\nNothing more can be added—\nThus it is said: *constant virtue is complete.*\n\nThe Uncarved is the whole of the Way;\nReturning to the Uncarved is to fully embody the Way.\n\nThe solitary and the orphaned do not fill the valley,\nYet kings and dukes consider themselves worthy—\nThus, embracing the Uncarved, all under Heaven becomes guest.\n\n**Explication:**\nOne nature, concentrated and still—\nPure emptiness alone.\nBeyond the self, nothing is not false—\nThus all beyond nature’s division is things.\n\nYet common people rejoice as if startled when they gain,\nAnd grieve as if startled when they lose—\nThis is regarding gain as honored, loss as humble.\n\nSome indulge in slander through wealth and nobility,\nOthers perish in poverty and lowliness—\nThis is regarding abundance as honored, restraint as humble.",

This is far from the Dao/Way.\n\nThus, the Sage *entrusts* (任) the Dao/Way to transform (化) and does not *exalt* (尚) *intelligence* or *strength*—for the Dao/Way transforms without being constrained by *things*, while *intelligence* and *strength* are themselves constrained by *things*.\n\nOnly by not being a *thing* can one *thing* all *things*—this is why the Sage *entrusts* the Dao/Way to transform and does not *exalt* *intelligence* or *strength*.\n\nThe *Qin* of *Ying* (嬴秦) merely *exalts* *intelligence* and *strength*—how could this suffice to govern the world? Therefore, the ancients said that *Qin* lost through its *forcefulness* (强). Yang Xiong called *Qin* a *wolf* (狼), and this too is because of this.\n\nThe world’s *divine instrument* (神器):\n**Huizong’s Annotation (徽宗注):** *Bound by form and number* (制於形数), *constrained by limits* (囿於方体), and *confined within the dual span of heaven and earth* (域於覆载之两问), this is what is called an *instrument* (器).\n*Established in the unfathomable* (立乎不测), *acting without fixed boundaries* (行乎无方), those who *wield* it fail, and those who *cling* to it lose. Hence, it is called the *divine instrument*.\n\n**Explication (疏义):** If one calls it the *Six Unities* (六合), then it is *bound by form and number*. If one calls it the *Universe* (宇宙), then it is *constrained by limits*. Though it spans the *dual realms of heaven and earth* (覆载之两间), it is not the *heaven and earth* themselves—thus, though vast, it is still an *instrument*.\n\nYet to *establish* it in the unfathomable without seeing its *advancement* (进), or to *act* without fixed boundaries yet never *encountering limits* (封), to *wield* it without knowing *non-action* (无为), then one must fail. To *cling* to it without knowing to *follow the times* (趋时), then one must lose. Though it has not departed from being an *instrument*, its *instrumentality* (为器) is indeed divine. Yet it cannot be *wielded*.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** To govern all *things* and command the myriad movements, there must be one who is not an *instrument*—only then can the world be governed. Hence it is said: *\"The Sage must practice non-action yet employ the world.\"*\n\n**Explication:** *Things* have *form*, then they can be named; they have *division*, then they can be guarded—this is what is called an *instrument*. There must be one who is not an *instrument*, only then can they *operate* their *instruments*.\n\nThe one who is not an *instrument* is the one who is not constrained by *things*—only by not being constrained by *things* can myriad *things* though numerous, and movements though diverse, all remain within the bounds of *prevention and guidance* (防范). Though they do not *intend* to govern and command, they naturally govern all *things* and command the myriad movements.\n\nAll who understand that the *thinger* (物物者) is not a *thing* (物) can thus achieve *non-action* (无为) yet fulfill the world’s tasks (功). Therefore, though they do not *govern* the world, the world is naturally governed.\n\nThe *Classic* says: *\"The Dao/Way is ever non-acting yet nothing it does not act upon. If rulers could guard this, all things would naturally transform.\"* Zhuangzi says: *\"The Sage must practice non-action yet employ the world.\"*\n\nThose who face south and rule the world, if they *cling to deeds* (事为) and their *traces* (迹), yet do not know to take *non-action* as constant, to *pursue the bounded* (有涯) while abandoning the *boundless* (元涯), then their *intelligence* will be constrained—how could they employ the world and transform all *things*?\n\nHence Zhuangzi says: *\"Excessive knowledge leads to defeat.\"* Those who *wield* meet with *defeat*.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** One who can *wield* yet cannot *non-act* will have their *intelligence* constrained.\n\nZhuangzi says: *\"Excessive knowledge leads to defeat.\"*\n\n**Explication:** To *enter* and *distinguish* with *things* is to differ; to *unify* is to practice *non-action*. To *exit* and *interact* with *things* is to *discriminate*—one cannot avoid *action*.\n\nIf one cannot avoid *action*, then they will inevitably encounter *opposition* (戾)—how could they avoid *defeat*?\n\nOnly by taking *non-action* as the *root* (本) and *action* as the *branches* (末), by *non-acting* yet *acting* without fail, can one *respond to things* with *abundance* (裕) and not *exhaust* their *intelligence*—who could be constrained?\n\nGuangchengzi says: *\"Excessive knowledge leads to defeat,\"* meaning that by *having no knowledge* (无知), one can *know nothing* (无不知)—what *defeat* is there?\n\nThose who *cling* will *lose*—\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** The Dao/Way’s most precious virtue is *timeliness* (时). To *cling* without transforming is to lose *timeliness*—this is called *contrary to the Dao*.\n\n**Explication:** *Timeliness* cannot be *stopped*, the Dao/Way cannot be *blocked*—*timeliness* shifts without pause, the Dao/Way adapts to change, hence the Dao/Way’s most precious virtue is *timeliness*.\n\n*Things* have no fixed *appropriateness* (宜)—*appropriateness* lies in *following the times*. If one *clings* without *losing*, if they are *stuck in one narrow view* (泥於一曲), then to *lose* is to *exceed*, and to *follow* is to *fall short*—how could they avoid *loss*?\n\nOnly by *transforming with the times* (与时俱化) and *having no fixed action* (无有专为) can one neither *lose timeliness* nor *contrary to the Dao*.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"The meaning of following the times is vast indeed.\"*\n\nHence, *things* either *move* (行) or *follow* (随), *inhale* (嘘) or *exhale* (吹), *strengthen* (强) or *weaken* (赢), *bear fruit* (载) or *wither* (隳).\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** The *principles* (理) of myriad *things*: some *move*, some *follow*—like the *eclipse* (往来) of sun and moon. Some *inhale*, some *exhale*—like the *cycles* (相代) of the four seasons. Some *strengthen*, some *weaken*—like the *ascendancy* (王) and *decline* (废) of the five phases. Some *bear fruit*, some *wither*—like the *growth* (开) and *fall* (落) of grasses and trees.\n\n*Serving the times* (役于时) yet *bound by numbers* (制于数), inevitably one cannot escape *burden*—only the Sage can avoid being burdened by *things* and stand alone above all *things*.\n\n*Going alone, coming alone*—this is called *having alone* (独有). The one who *has alone* is called the *most noble* (至贵).\n\nThus, *operating* the *divine instrument* leaves *abundance*—though *things* vary in their *states*, the Sage’s *heart* remains ever unified.\n\n**Explication:** When it is said to *go*, the moon comes; sun and moon alternate in their *illumination*—never ceasing, like the *principles* of *things* that either *move* or *follow*. Spring comes first, summer follows—seasons cycle without end, like the *principles* of *things* that either *inhale* or *exhale*.\n\nWhen wood *strengthens*, water *weakens*—when fire *arises*, metal is *bound*—like the *principles* of *things* that either *strengthen* or *weaken*, as in the *ascendancy* and *decline* of the five phases. When grain *dies*, wheat *grows*—when trees *fall*, the *millet* (鞠) *blossoms*—like the *principles* of *things* that either *bear fruit* or *wither*, as in the *growth* and *fall* of grasses and trees.\n\nFrom *moving* and *following* to *bearing fruit* and *withering*, all are *served by timeliness*—thus they *end with timeliness*, *bound by numbers*—thus they *exhaust with numbers*. This is why they *cycle endlessly* yet cannot escape *burden*.」",

The *root* is the cultivation of spirit, heart, and method.\n\nArms cannot be abandoned, yet the five *ends* were possessed by the ancients.\nThe virtuous focus on the *root*, thus they did not prioritize them. To assist the sovereign with the Dao is to excel as a virtuous one—how could one drive the people to the brink of death and life, using coercion to subdue the world?\n\nIn days past, King Hui of Liang wished to avenge his humiliation by offering a single cup of wine to the dead of Chu. Mencius taught him that the virtuous have no rival—yet this was not by subduing the world with arms. This is the principle of *good returns*.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThis is what Mencius meant by *\"return unto yourself.\"*\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nIf one acts with goodness, others will respond in kind. If one acts with harm, others will respond likewise. This is the law of *return unto oneself*. If one takes delight in warfare and killing, what manner of retribution will they receive? Hence, *good returns*.\n\nWhere the teacher treads, brambles grow.\nAfter great armies, famine follows.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe lower ranks are drained of strength, hence brambles grow.\nThe ruler defies the natural order, hence there are years of scarcity.\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"To pacify the myriad states,\nAnd reap abundant harvests.\"*\n\nTo pacify the myriad states is to bring harmony to the people.\nWhen the people are harmonious, the harmony of Heaven and Earth responds in kind.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nPlowing without recklessness, weeding without destruction—this is the exertion of human effort.\nSnow falls abundantly, rain nourishes the roots—this is the favor of Heaven’s timing.\nWarfare is not the means to strengthen the land’s power.\nTo the point of draining the people’s strength, hence brambles grow.\nWarfare is not the means to summon harmonious *qi*.\nTo the point of defying Heaven’s timing, hence there are years of scarcity.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"To pacify the myriad states,\nAnd reap abundant harvests.\"*\n\nTo pacify the myriad states is to bring harmony to the people.\nWhen the people are in harmony, they align with Heaven and Earth in one *qi*—\nthus, when the people are harmonious, the harmony of Heaven and Earth responds.\n\nThis is a martial poem, differing from Laozi’s teachings,\nto illustrate how the Sage’s intent surpasses the martial ambitions of men.\nThus, the good seek fulfillment alone,\nand dare not claim strength through conquest.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nTo seek what is right in action, to achieve completion in deeds,\nto expend little effort yet see great results—\nthis is the Dao of the Sage.\nTo conquer through force is the mark of a cruel virtue,\nhence victory in war lies in harmony, not in numbers.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nThough undertakings differ, all seek what is right.\nThough achievements differ, all seek completion.",

*\"not the Dao.\"*\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe Dao has no beginning or end,\nand does not align with the transformations of things.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nIts beginning has no origin—\nwho can trace its source?\nIts end has no conclusion—\nwho can define its limit?\nFrom antiquity, it has always existed,\nyet it transcends all transformations.\nThus, the Dao does not conform to the changes of things.\nThe Dao and things are fundamentally apart—\nhence, *\"things flourish and then decay\"* is called *\"not the Dao.\"*\n\n*\"Not the Dao\"* is early decline.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nTo exist outside the Dao is to invite the contrast of flourishing and decay.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nBound within the Great Transformation,\nrigidity becomes strength,\ndecay becomes weakness—\nall things follow this pattern,\nfor they exist outside the Dao.\nThe Dao, enduring from ancient times,\nknows no decay or vigor—\nhow could it follow such cycles?\n\n---\n**On martial prowess (Chapter Thirty-One):**\n*\"Fine weapons are ominous instruments—*\nthings naturally abhor them,\nso those who follow the Dao do

measure,\nand those who follow the Dao display virtue rather than martial might—\nthus, they do not dwell upon them.\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nAll phenomena arise from some origin,\nand auspicious signs precede blessings—\nthis is the natural order.\nWhen blessings manifest in things, they are called *\"omens.\"*\nThus, the *Yijing* states that auspicious events bring omens.\nBut weapons are instruments of misfortune—\nwhat auspicious sign could precede them?\nHence, they are *\"ominous.\"*\n\nStill, reckless warfare is akin to sacrilege,\nand though the ancient kings did not abandon it,\nthose who conceal their virtue do not flaunt their might,\nand those who wage war without restraint leave no legacy—\nthus, they do not display their armies.\n\nAs the *Commentaries* say: *\"Weapons are stored yet used in due measure\"*—\nthis refers to such conduct.\n\nKing Wu stored his arms and discarded his bows,\nseeking virtuous governance to restore the Xia—\nthis was displaying virtue without martial show.\n\nMoreover, martial prowess is a hidden virtue,\nconcealed like a crown or a wrapped foot—\nit is advanced like a footstep, yet unused.\nThus, those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon it.\n\nHence, the gentleman values the left in peace,\nbut the right in war.\n\nWeapons are ominous instruments,\nnot the tools of the gentleman.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe left embodies *yang*—generative, life-affirming—\nthe right embodies *yin*—destructive, punitive.\n*Yang* is virtue, *yin* is punishment—\nthe gentleman honors virtue and fears punishment,\nthus weapons are *\"not the gentleman’s instrument.\"*\n\n**Explanatory Commentary:**\nThe Great Dao is vast and unbounded,\nyet it has left and right—\nthus, the left is *yang*, the right is *yin*.\n*Yin* and *yang* are the origins of life and death—\n*yang* governs life, *yin* governs death.\nVirtue governs life, hence Guanzi says *yang* is virtue,\npunishment governs death, hence Guanzi says *yin* is punishment.\nWhen virtue is complete, it ascends—\nnothing can diminish it,\nthus the gentleman values virtue.\nWhen punishment is to be applied,\nmusic is silenced—\nthus

(subtle).\nIn perfect unity with essence, it returns to the most profound,\nand can be named only as *xiǎo* (small).\nThis *Dao* does not cling to form,\nnor is it confined to number.\nThe True Lord

Yet the eyelashes of a man are close at hand—even if one were to summon the legendary *Zhujia* (離朱, \"the far-seeing\") to squint and scrutinize them in broad daylight, he would not see them.

This is what *Han Fei* records of *Duzi* (杜子, \"Master Du\")—that wisdom is like the eye, able to see a hundred paces away, yet unable to see its own eyelashes.\n\n*Mengzi* (Mencius) says: The faculty of distinguishing right from wrong is the beginning of wisdom.\n*Zuozi* (苟子, \"Master Zuo\") says: To affirm what is right and deny what is wrong is what we call wisdom. To discern the deceitful or upright in others, as one distinguishes white from black, is to affirm what is right and deny what is wrong. Thus, wisdom as the eye can see what is external yet cannot self-examine—it can only know others.\n\nBut self-knowledge is clarity.\n\nHuizong’s annotation states: The *Yijing* (易經, *Classic of Changes*) says, “To recover is to know oneself.” The *Commentary* says: “To inwardly gaze is what we call clarity.” Wisdom, in knowing others, becomes entangled in interaction—this is called *xinzhou* (心鬥, \"mental contention\"), or using one’s mind to vie with others. Yet to recover and know oneself is to remain still and return to the root—seeing oneself is all. It is the balance of heaven and earth, the illumination of all things.\n\n*Shuyi* further expounds: To recover the subtle and discern in things, to return to the root and be still—stillness brings clarity, and there is nothing it does not penetrate. Hence, the *Yijing* says, “To recover is to know oneself.” To inwardly gaze is to see without attachment, to see others yet truly see oneself—thus, the *Commentary* says, “To inwardly gaze is what we call clarity.”\n\nTo employ wisdom in discerning the deceitful or upright in others is to uphold what is right and reject what is wrong, to look around and have all things respond—this is to engage in *xinzhou*, using an empty, unified, and tranquil mind to daily judge. The rectification of right and wrong is thus the work of knowing others, no more.\n\nBut to recover and know oneself is to inwardly observe the single nature, to remain still and return to the root, to see what others do not see and to perceive the unseen forms—thus attaining what is called *jianjian* (見見, \"true seeing\"). Is there anything greater than this in heaven and earth? To see is to attain its balance.",

Those who excel over others possess *power*, but those who conquer themselves are *strong*.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The Sage values virtue/power over force, striving to conquer oneself rather than others.\"* The wise deceive the foolish, the brave endure the cowardly—this is excelling over others, relying on *power* alone. To conquer one’s own selfishness, maintaining rectitude without injury—this is conquering oneself. When one goes forth, standing alone without fear; when dwelling, retreating from the world without discontent—never venturing forth without triumph, this is the source of *strength*.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"The foolish cannot be trusted with schemes, so the wise employ their discernment to deceive them. The cowardly cannot stand against adversity, so the brave summon their vigor to endure them—this is the valuing of force to triumph over others. To conquer one’s selfishness with a resolute mind, nurturing non-harm and preserving one’s *qi*—this is the valuing of virtue/power to conquer oneself. Only by conquering oneself does one remain unshaken when external things press upon them, unable to destroy one’s true being. Thus, going forth, one stands alone without fear; dwelling, one retreats from the world without discontent. To stand alone yet fear nothing is to be brave in *righteousness*. To retreat from the world yet feel no discontent is to find peace in *fate*. Whether one goes forth or dwells, never venturing without triumph—this is why they are called *ultimately strong*.\"*\n\nThose who know sufficiency are rich. The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"To possess myriad differences is what we call richness.\"* The *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"The myriad transformations of existence bear distinct names, yet they do not lose their essence—this is ultimate richness, where the measure of sufficiency resides in one’s self. As Zhuangzi said: 'To possess myriad differences is what we call richness.' Only those who know sufficiency roam within the *boundaries* (of the body), finding sufficiency in themselves. Thus, their head is round, their feet square, and heaven and earth take their place; their chest faces south, their back north, and yin and yang are fully embraced. All things have their limits, yet all are complete—what riches of Jin and Chu could compare? The sufficiency of those who know sufficiency is everlasting, hence the treasures of the realm gather within them.\"*\n\nThose who act with *strength* possess *will*.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"To persist in self-strengthening is to uphold *will* in the Dao/Way.\"* The *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"To exert oneself in study and inquiry broadens one’s knowledge and sharpens wisdom; to exert oneself in practicing the Dao/Way awakens virtue/power and yields great achievements. Thus, those who strive in action rely on self-strengthening, and self-strengthening is what we call having *will*. The *Daoist Classic on Virtue/Power* says: 'The Superior Sage hears the Dao/Way and moves to act upon it.' Truly, those who uphold *will* in the Dao/Way—hearing the Dao/Way and moving to act—accumulate true strength over time, persisting in self-strengthening without end. Could this be done by those without *will*? Those who do not lose their place endure long; those who conform to time and shift with things can only last temporarily. The *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"If one can embody the eternal without change, steadfast in what they guard, they can then let the Dao/Way unfold in action, enduring boundlessly. In the *Book of Changes*, the *Commentary* speaks of the Sage standing firm without shifting direction, and the *Symbol* says: 'The Sage endures long in their Dao/Way.' This is precisely what is meant. If one is confined by time and shifts with things, how could they not lose their place? The aged and the young transform, and one shifts with them—could they truly not lose their place?\"*\n\nThose who die yet do not perish are *long-lived*.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Life has its root in growth, death has its return in origin; tracing the beginning and returning to the end, one understands the teachings of death and life.\"* The *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"The Sage comprehends the Dao/Way of day and night, knowing that death is not fundamentally different from life. Thus, their form dissolves, yet their spirit does not perish, enduring alongside heaven and earth without known limit—what else could be called *long-lived*? This chapter’s meaning begins with knowing others to exhaust principles, proceeds to knowing sufficiency to fulfill nature, and concludes with not perishing to attain *fate*—thus, creation dwells within us. Who but those without past or future, entering the realm of neither death nor life, could attain this? The *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"All things: life emerges from the One, death returns to the One. Life has its root in growth, death has its end in return. To trace the beginning and know the teachings of death—like Zhuangzi’s words: 'Mingled between the coarse and the fine, it transforms and gives rise to *qi*; *qi* transforms and gives rise to form, now again transforming into death.' To return to the end and know the teachings of life—like Zhuangzi’s words: 'How do I know that the dead do not regret their life? Perhaps their joy lies in the firewood’s first sprouting.' Beginning and end oppose the boundless, yet no one knows where they end—how could death and life be fundamentally different? It is merely the One, threading through all. Day and night alternate, dividing into darkness and light, and all things flow in the space between heaven and earth, serving the cycles of day and night. Day and night succeed one another, just as life and death replace each other. Those confined by time and shifting with things are destined to be overtaken by the bounds of day and night. Only the enlightened know that all is One, that death and life are but a single thread. Though they come and go with things, there is what we call 'not coming,' though they move with things, there is what we call 'not moving.' Knowing that death is not fundamentally different from life, their form undergoes myriad changes, dissolving with time, yet their true nature remains serene, their spirit unperishing. Thus, comprehending the Dao/Way of day and night, they know their independence—this is the ultimate One. Heaven endures long, earth persists forever, and together they endure without limit.

instruction,\nand the people turn to them as to parents—\nthus it is said: *Holding the Great Symbol, all under Heaven comes*.\n\n*Exegesis*: The heavens manifest the Symbol,\nand the sage follows its lead.\nThe heavens’ manifestation is smooth yet without stagnation,\ncirculating endlessly without pause—\nits movement is vigorous and unflagging.\nWhat need does it have for action?\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"Non-action as its action is the heaven’s way.\"*\n*The Book of Changes* says: *\"The heaven’s movement is vigorous.\"*\nThis is non-action yet moving by vigor.\n\nThe stars revolve, the

transformations,\ngrasping the Great Symbol to show the people—\nlike the heaven’s manifestation,\nresting in non-action,\nthough acting yet never crossing the boundary of non-action;\nwalking silent instruction,\nthough teaching yet never uttering the intent of speech.\n\nThus, the people’s turning to them\nis like water flowing downward—\ntheir love is as close as parents,\ntheir attachment unbreakable as glue and lacquer.\nHence it is said: *Holding the Great Symbol, all under Heaven comes*.\n\nAs for the Great Symbol,\nit is seen yet cannot be grasped—\nthe *Classics* say: *\"The Great

*Liezi* says: *\"The spirits have no response.\"*\nThey fulfill the needs of all living things,\nand all living things cling to their homeland—\nthus all living things are uninjured—\nas *Liezi* says:

      "translated_text": "**Volume Eight of *Explanatory Notes on the Dao-De Jing* (continued)**\n\nHuizong’s annotation states: *\"The Dao has no fixed form; virtue has completion and deficiency. Aligning with the Dao means there is no virtue to be named, while distinguishing from virtue means there is virtue to be discerned.\"* The *Ren-Yi-Li-Zhi* [仁義禮智], according to their measure, are received, and according to the times, they are applied—this is virtue alone. Those who embody the Dao differ from this, hence they are placed in the lower scriptures.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* state: *\"Adaptability is the Dao; thus the Dao cannot be sought in fixed ways. The Dao beyond form is called the Dao; thus the Dao cannot be sought in fixed forms.\"* The Dao is present in all things: look upward and it is in the heights, look downward and it is in the depths, strive forward and it is in the front, cast aside and it is in the rear. It has no gate, no side path—its boundless radiance extends in all four directions. This is its formlessness. It can be yielding yet firm, soft yet hard, short yet long, round yet square; precious yet empty. Gazing upon it all day, one cannot see it—this is its formlessness.\n\nIf the Dao has no fixed form, how can there be completion and deficiency in virtue? If virtue has a fixed form, how can there not be completion and deficiency in it? Virtue has high and low; only by elevating it can one ascend to its completion, otherwise it will be deficient. Virtue has small and great; only by cultivating it can one progress to its completion, otherwise it will be deficient.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"When virtue is complete, this is called ‘establishment’*; thus virtue indeed has completion.\"* Again he said: *\"The proper may be deficient*; thus virtue indeed has deficiency.\"* Viewed from their unity, it aligns with the Dao, with no virtue to be named—Yang Xiong’s *\"unity is wholeness\"*, Zhuangzi’s *\"virtue encompasses the singularity of the Dao\"*. Viewed from their distinction, it separates from virtue, with virtue to be discerned—Yang Xiong’s *\"separation is dispersion\"*, as the scripture says: *\"When the Great Dao is abandoned, there is Ren and Yi\"* [大道廢有仁義].\n\nRen is the proper conduct for humanity, applied as fitting; Li is the way to enact it; Zhi is the way to know it. The worthy discern its vastness, the unworthy attend to its minutiae. The benevolent see it and call it *Ren*, the wise see it and call it *Zhi*—each receives according to their measure, and applies it according to the times. This is virtue alone.\n\nBut the Dao is otherwise: it universally encompasses all without distinction, flows ceaselessly and fills all without lack, bestows benefits and achieves completion without ever exhausting itself. Who could speak of completion or deficiency in the Dao?\n\nThose who embody the Dao differ from virtue in this way, hence virtue is placed in the lower scriptures.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: \"The Upper Virtue Does Not Virtue\"**\nThe upper virtue does not virtue, hence it has virtue. Huizong’s annotation states: *\"When things are granted life, this is called virtue. If all receive it equally, it is silently in accord with the Dao. When one transgresses, they do not repent; when one is appropriate, they do not feel self-satisfied—this is called ‘not virtue’.\"* When Confucius did not dwell upon his sainthood yet acted in the manner of the sage, this was his way of having virtue.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* state: *\"Speaking of its origin, life is not virtue unless clarified. Speaking of its completion, life is the radiance of virtue.\"* All things within the realm of existence have life, and the reason they live is that they obtain the One. What is the One? Virtue nearly arises from it—Zhuangzi’s *\"the One from which all things arise, the One yet unformed\"*. When things are granted life, this is virtue. If nature is equal and virtue is shared, then all receive it equally. If virtue is in accord with the Dao, then it silently aligns with the Dao.\n\nOnly by knowing nature and reflecting upon virtue, when virtue reaches its initial state, does one move according to principle and act according to the times—this is transgression. Not transgressing by choice, but because principle does not allow otherwise—what is there to repent? When one is appropriate, it is not by choice, but because principle does not allow otherwise—thus one does not feel self-satisfied. The True Person’s virtue is such; this is called ‘not virtue’.\n\nIf otherwise, then reckless and wild behavior, stepping boldly upon the Great Square and moving without restraint, circulating within the central rites—this can be called upper virtue? In the past, Confucius, though endowed by Heaven with the potential for sainthood, when answering Gongxi Hua’s question, said: *\"If it were about sainthood and virtue, how could I dare?\"* When answering Zigong’s question, he said: *\"Sainthood, I cannot achieve; I do not dwell upon my sainthood.\"* Yet when times were clear, he was clear; when times were demanding, he took responsibility; when times were harmonious, he was harmonious. Gathering the great achievements of the Three Sages, Mencius regarded this as the time of sainthood, and said: *\"Since the birth of the people, there has been none like Master Kong.\"* His virtue is evident.\n\nThe lower virtue does not lose virtue, hence it lacks virtue. Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Recognizing and possessing virtue, one is selfish and loses the Dao—what virtue remains?\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* state: *\"The Dao within me has never had a fixed form. If one claims possession of the Dao, the Dao will abandon you. Thus, recognizing and possessing virtue are all delusions.\"* Moreover, to cultivate oneself for private gain and to abandon private gain for the public good—this is what the Dao does for the public, yet to claim possession of the Dao is selfish. Only the selfless can achieve their private gain; how could selfishness not lose the Dao?\n\nTo desire not to lose virtue yet to lack virtue—what else is this but lower virtue?\n\n**The Upper Virtue Acts Without Action, Yet Nothing Remains Unacted**\nHuizong’s annotation states: *\"Without thought yet attaining, without effort yet accurate, without movement yet arriving—this is upper virtue.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* state: *\"One nature has awareness, piercing through the boundless—this is ‘without thought yet attaining’. Employing it without strain, naturally in accord with the Dao—this is ‘without effort yet accurate’. Never exerting force, yet nowhere does it fail to be preserved—this is ‘without movement yet arriving’. If such, then acting is non-acting, and non-acting emerges from acting. The peak of virtue cannot be surpassed—thus it is called upper virtue.\"*\n\n**The Lower Virtue Acts With Action, Yet Nothing Remains Unacted**\nHuizong’s annotation states: *\"Without thought, one does not attain; without effort, one is not accurate; without movement, one does not arrive—this is lower virtue.\"*",

from one another—\nthis is威 (awe) and德 (virtue).\nWhere substance is thick, appearance is thin—\nthis is the ritual of father and son.\n\nThus observed, the more elaborate the ritual,\nthe more surely substance decays.\nWhen substance decays, deceit follows,\nand contention and chaos arise—\nhence, ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nand the origin of chaos.\n\n**Explanation of Meaning:**\nThe Dao is ever without action, thus without form—\nwithout form, it is not \"that.\"\nHence, it cannot be attained.\nYet the Dao is the revered foundation of virtue—\nso one loses the Dao and then attains virtue.\nVirtue, once obtained, is within oneself—\nwithin oneself, there is nothing external—\nhence, it cannot be hoarded.\nYet virtue encompasses all that can be done as ren—\nso one loses virtue and then attains ren.\nVirtue is without action, but ren carries the heart of love and benefit—\nthus ren can be cultivated.\nYet when cultivated, it approaches righteousness—\nso one loses ren and then attains righteousness.\nRighteousness, when thick in substance, must be set in proper measure—\nthus it can be diminished.\nWhen diminished, it is adorned with ritual—\nso one loses righteousness and then attains ritual.\n\nFrom losing the Dao to ritual,\neach descent is lower,\nthe farther from the Dao,\nthe more is lost.\nFor action brings deceit,\nnon-action brings truth—\nthus their difference is so great.\n\nNon-action, then, is the root of all things,\nand the reason virtue is supreme—\nthis is so.\n\nMoreover, the ebb and flow never cease,\nkings rise and fall in succession,\nthings do not flourish simultaneously—\nthis is yin and yang.\nWhen yang prevails, yin withdraws in listening,\nwhen yin prevails, yang hides in concealment.\nWhat is diminished here must overflow there—\nthis is awe and virtue.\nTo govern with virtue, awe is not the priority;\nto rule with awe, virtue comes afterward—\nthis is the natural order, unchangeable.\n\nThus, the ritual of father and son,\nthough thin in appearance, is thick in substance—\nas Zhuangzi said:\n*\"Dressing like a market peddler’s feet,\nhe excuses himself with fright,\nhis brother with a nurse’s voice,\nand with great respect for his elders—*\nthis is the meaning.\n\nThus observed, elaborate ritual decays in substance—\nlike a tree not yet flourishing, its root must already be weak.\nWhen substance decays, deceit follows,\nand contention and chaos arise—\nhow then could it be substantial yet unknown as loyal?\nHow could it be proper yet unknown as trustworthy?\n\nGiven how ritual fosters deceit in this way,\none must abandon the false and take the true,\nand extinguish it.\n\nThe *Records* say that loyal and trustworthy persons can learn ritual—\nthis is because it values its root.\n\n**Premature Knowledge** is the flower of the Dao,\nand the beginning of folly.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nThe Dao descends and manifests,\nmanifests and gives rise to wisdom.\nWisdom, when used as a chisel,\nsharpened and applied,\nwears out the spirit and recklessly measures—\nthis is premature knowledge.\nPremature knowledge follows superficiality and forgets the root—\nthus it is the flower of the Dao.\nThe heart labors, and wisdom grows more constrained—\nthus it is the beginning of folly.\nThough it often succeeds, this is why Confucius despised Zigong.\n\n**Explanation of Meaning:**\nRen, righteousness, ritual, and wisdom—\nnone are outside virtue.\nThe Dao descends and manifests,\nmanifests and gives rise to wisdom.\nThough wisdom branches from the Dao,\nit is still rooted in the Dao.\nYet what Confucius despised in wisdom\nwas its inability to act without interference—\nthis is using wisdom as a chisel.\nHow much more so when probing the nature of things,\nsharpening its grasp,\nwearing out the spirit in shallow depths,\nrecklessly measuring—\nthis is premature knowledge,\nthe flower of the Dao, not its substance.\nThough it may seem plausible, it is not so.\nFor minor knowledge harms virtue,\nlost knowledge harms the Dao—\nbut premature knowledge,\nboasting cleverness and skill,\nalready follows superficiality and forgets the root,\nnot knowing to nourish the source of wisdom\nwhile frugally expending it—\nthough it has not yet reached harming virtue or the Dao,\nit is still not the true Dao.\n\nIf so, then deceit arises,\nthe heart labors daily, growing more clumsy,\nand wisdom is constrained—\nthis is the nature of premature knowledge,\nand why it is the beginning of folly.\nThough it often succeeds, this is why Confucius despised Zigong.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Do not anticipate deceit,\ndo not recklessly measure the untrustworthy.\"*\nYet this was the foresight of the virtuous—\nhow much more so the wise?\n\nThus, the superior person dwells in substance, not in superficiality,\nresides in truth, not in its adornment—\nand so abandons the false to take the true.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:**\nWhat is \"there\" is what the Dao rejects.\nWhat is \"here\" is what the Dao upholds.\nWhat the Dao upholds is thick, not thin,\nsubstantial, not superficial—\nunless one’s wisdom is sufficient to know oneself,\nreturning to one’s original nature\nwithout drifting into the habits of things—\nwho could do this?\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Thickly restore, without regret—\nself-examination in the center.\"*\nThick—this is

thus,\nand so they endure noble virtue for ten thousand generations without losing it.\nIs it not true that humility is not the root of evil?\n\nThus they attain many praises yet no true praise.\nThe *Huizong* (Emperor Gaozong) notes:\n*\"If one elevates oneself to overcome others,\nif one claims nobility to degrade others,\nif one is strong yet does not know to yield with gentleness,\nif one is bright yet does not know to temper with darkness—\nseeking praise from the world while their governance earns frequent commendation—\nthen exaggerated praise will gather swiftly,\nand baseless slander will follow soon after,\nand thus they earn no true praise.\"*\n\nThe *Shuyi* (Explanatory Notes) say:\n*\"Not by others’ lowliness do we raise ourselves,\nthen will people gladly exalt us;\nNot by others’ degradation do we claim our nobility,\nthen will people honor and revere us.\nTo elevate oneself to overcome others—\nthis is artificial pride, what use is there in such elevation?\nTo claim nobility by degrading others—\nthis is leveraging power, what use is there in such nobility?\nGentleness overcomes rigidity—\nthis is the natural order;\nrigidity yet unaware of yielding to gentleness—\nthis is knowing only extension, not knowing retreat.\nBrightness without blinding—\nthis is the Dao’s return;\nbrightness yet unaware of tempering with darkness—\nthis is knowing only display, not knowing subtlety.\nWith this, they boast of the world’s flaws,\nthough it may suffice to sell their name and earn frequent commendation,\nit is merely a violation of the Dao to provoke it.\nIf so, then unearned praise will gather swiftly,\nand baseless slander will follow soon after—\nhow could they escape Mencius’ scorn?\nSeeking praise like this—\nthen their reputation floats above true merit, what difference does it make?\nWhen the channels are full, their drying can be awaited,\nand praise will soon be followed by blame—\nhow can it endure long?\nTo call this *no true praise*—\nis this not fitting?\n\nThey do not wish to be *glittering like jade*,\nnor *rugged like stone*.\nThe *Huizong* notes:\n*\"Jade is noble, stone is base,\nyet both are fixed and unchanging.\"*\n\nThe sage rides the times and follows nature,\nunhindered in their course,\nwith all change yet the heart ever steady—\nthis is the true attainment of *Oneness*.\nThus they cannot be fixed as noble or base.\nMencius said:\n*\"What I detest in those who cling to Oneness,\nis that they cling to one thing while abandoning the hundred.*\nThey do not wish to be *glittering like jade*,\nnor *rugged like stone*—\nonly the sage who knows the transformations can reach this,\nand this is called *Supreme Virtue*.\"*\n\nThe *Shuyi* say:\n*\"Virtue has essence and function,\nwith all change contained within it.\nWondrously observing its essence—\nall myriad things can be gathered into Oneness;\nbroadly observing its function—\nwith Oneness, all myriad things can be enacted.\nAdjusting and responding to it—\nno action is unfit,\nflowing through the mechanisms of emergence and return,\ncirculating in the uses of transformation—\nthis is the true Oneness,\nserene and alone in its existence.\nHow could it be like the *glittering jade* that is noble yet cannot be base,\nor the *rugged stone* that is base yet cannot be noble,\nbound to a fixed essence,\ngrasped yet unchanging?\nThe sage’s movement is like water,\nskilled in timing yet never lost,\navoiding obstacles yet never blocked,\nadapting to square and round, straight and bent—\nresponding to change without constancy,\nhow could there be any hindrance?\nThe deeper the inquiry, the farther the exploration,\nthough it encompasses myriad transformations,\nit remains ever true to the One—\nthis is the true attainment of Oneness.\nThus they cannot be fixed as noble or base,\nfor Oneness knows no nobility or baseness.\nLaozi, having clarified the meaning of Oneness,\nfurther warned those who cling to one-sidedness,\nlest they be blinded by a single perspective,\nunable to encompass all and ignorant of ultimate truth—\nrigid like jade and stone,\nstuck and unyielding.\nThus he reiterated his teaching.\nMencius said: *‘What I detest in those who cling to Oneness,\nis that they cling to one thing while abandoning the hundred.’*\nThis is exactly his intent.\nThus they do not wish to be *glittering like jade*,\nnor *rugged like stone*—\nonly the sage who is vast and transformative can reach this.\nThe *Yijing* says: *‘To exhaust the spirit and know the transformations,\nthis is the height of virtue.’*\nThe sage’s way of knowing the transformations—\nis also through *non-action* and *non-inaction*,\nand this is called *Supreme Virtue*.\"*\n\n**Chapter 40: *Fǎn* (Return) of the *Yijing* (Changes)**\n*The *Fǎn* (Return) is the Dao’s movement—\nthe *weak* is the Dao’s use.\nAll things under heaven are born of *having*,\nand *having* is born of *non-having*.\nThe *Huizong* notes:\n*\"The principles of all under heaven—\nmovement and stillness interdepend,\nstrength and weakness complement each other.\nThe myriad things, each returning to their root,\nthen already past yet return again,\nrestoring to the utmost stillness.\nYet, when they are stirred and thus connect with all under heaven,\nthen movement is none other than myself,\nand thus it is said: *‘The *Fǎn* (Return) is the Dao’s movement.’*\nGentleness overcomes rigidity,\nweakness overcomes strength—\nthe Dao’s wondrous use lies here.\nZhuangzi said: *‘The accumulation of many small non-victories becomes a great victory,\nonly the sage can do this,’*\nand thus it is said: *‘The *weak* is the Dao’s use.’*\nThe seasons’ course—\nthey gather and store in winter,\nonly to flourish and renew in spring.\nWater’s nature is utmost gentleness,\nyet in attacking rigidity and strength,\nnone can surpass it—\nis this not what is meant?\nThus *having* and *non-having* generate each other,\nlike a cycle—\nso *non-having* gives rise to movement,\nand *having* reaches its limit and returns to *non-having*,\nlike the *Yin* and *Yang* of the *Yijing*’s *Xī* (The Last) hexagram,\nyet they cannot be said to negate each other.\nThose who are obscured by *non-action*,\ndrowned in *partial action*—\nhow could this be the Dao?\"\n\nThe *Shuyi* say:\n*\"Movement arises from stillness established,\nand all under heaven’s moving lines return to stillness;\nstrength arises from weakness accumulated,\nand all under heaven’s strong lines must gather from weakness.\nThus movement and stillness interdepend,\nstrength and weakness complement each other—\nthis is the natural order.\nThe myriad things’ birth—\nthey flow in countless forms,\nlike the swift and the fleeting,\nyet in their

To dwell where others abhor, hence it appears as humiliation.\"*\n\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"The Classic states: ‘Bright and clear, penetrating and insightful.’ Zhuangzi said: ‘With this, one clarifies the heart.’ Thus, great brightness is the Way’s manifestation as flawless. How could one not see any flaw without purifying and removing external attachments, without possessing? How could one not recognize the profound and subtle principles without gazing into the depths and silently knowing them? Only when one is flawless can they stand apart from the common yet not be opposed by it, be an eccentric yet not be excluded by others—like water, dwelling where others abhor, hence it appears as humiliation. This is what Zhuangzi recorded of Laozi’s Dao/Way and techniques: ‘Know its brightness, preserve its humiliation.’*\n\n*\"Ample virtue appears insufficient—*\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Virtue is all-embracing yet does not consider itself excessive, hence it appears insufficient.\"*\n\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"The highest virtue does not claim virtue, hence it has virtue; the lowest virtue does not lose virtue, hence it lacks virtue. When virtue reaches the point of embracing all without exclusion, it is indeed broad. Yet if one considers it as having excess, then it is not broad. Only when one does not consider it as having excess, does its embrace of all become truly boundless. Thus, it appears as insufficient.*\n\n*\"The Autumn Waters rise in season, yet the River Warden is pleased—*\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"The River Warden, though pleased, is mocked by those of great insight, for he does not know the vastness of the Eastern Sea, believing all beauty to be within himself. This is how one who lacks virtue is laughed at by the wise.\"*\n\n*\"Established virtue appears as theft—*\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The Sage deliberates to act yet does not seek success. Though they act with deliberation, success is inevitable, yet this does not mean they seek it. Thus, their established virtue seems like theft, for they act without intent.\"*\n\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"The Sage’s engagement with the world is without contrivance. Only without contrivance can they act in matters of creation and enterprise, all arising from necessity—what Zhuangzi called ‘not compelled by necessity in affairs.’ Yet even emperors and kings achieve results without deliberate action. Though they deliberate to act, they do not aim for success, yet each action succeeds—this is their established virtue, seemingly like theft, for they act without intent.*\n\n*\"The *Analects* say: ‘If one does not abandon the old, the people will not be negligent.’ Negligence leads to superficiality and thinness, yet because they act without intent, it appears as theft.*\n\n*\"Pure essence seems like mud—*\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Should one not say: ‘Though polished, it does not gleam’?

The True Person’s application of the heart cuts off the root of benevolence yet does not wither it, enriches the source of wisdom yet restrains its expression. In their perception, there is no favoritism; in their hearing, no excess. Their *qi* is full yet without deficiency, finding their own fulfillment without relying on others. Though they distinguish themselves from things, they remain in true clarity while discerning illusion.

Yin and Yang are unfathomable, and the Spirit cannot be sought in any fixed form. Thus, in the realm of supreme clarity, at the origin of utmost Yang, entering the gate of profound obscurity, at the origin of utmost Yin—this is how the Way has form that can be pointed to. Though the Way has form that can be pointed to, it adapts flexibly to all things, leaving no trace of rigid distinction. It responds spontaneously without fixed patterns—this is the square of the boundless, differing from virtue that has corners. Hence, though it has form, it does not sever.*\n\n*\"The *Book of Odes* says: ‘Solemn and dignified, the bearing of virtue.’ Thus, virtue’s corners can be known.

Yet there is a vessel that transcends form and enters awareness, creating shape while existing beyond measure, standing in the unfathomable, moving without trace, uniquely surpassing all images and precedents—this is the vessel of the boundless.

Even if Li Zhu were to gaze at midday, wiping his eyes and raising his brows in expectation, he would not see its form, hence it is called the Great Image. For what is seen is called an image; yet when there is seeing, to say it is formless is to speak of the form that does not manifest. This is what Zhuangzi meant by dwelling in the profound and obscure. Though unseen, all things that have form arise from it—its role as an image is indeed great. The Classic says: ‘The image of the formless.’*\n*The Huainanzi* says: *\"There is no form, yet from it all forms arise. Is this not what is meant by the Great Image being formless?\"*\n\n*The Dao is hidden and nameless.*\nOnly the Dao is good at lending and completing.\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"From the Illuminated Dao to the Great Image, all are the Dao. The subtlety of the Dao cannot be sought with intellect nor pursued with form—it is hidden, and yet one cannot make it clear.\"*\n\nThe Sage attains the Dao, thus giving without depletion, responding without exhaustion, and completing all things without claiming possession—merely resting therein. The essence of the Dao is hidden in its namelessness, yet its function is to lend and complete effortlessly. Thus, with diligent practice, one arrives at the formless and rests in the untransformed. The remaining matters suffice for imperial governance. *The Transmission* says: *\"Learning begins with becoming a scholar and ends with becoming a Sage.\"*\n\n*The Exegesis* says: *\"The Dao is nowhere without being present, manifesting as essence when in essence, as function when in function—nameless and without substance, yet never separate from named and substantial things. Thus, from the Illuminated Dao to the Great Image, though their names differ, all are the Dao. Yet the utmost subtlety of the Dao is profound and obscure—though not separate from named things, it cannot be sought with intellect. The utmost extremity of the Dao is hazy and silent—though not separate from material things, it cannot be pursued with form. It is indeed hidden. Though one may force a name upon it, the original source of the Dao resists naming, for the Dao is hidden and nameless.\"*\n\nThe Sage attains the Dao, using ultimate emptiness to govern all things and ultimate substance to move all things. Thus, the more one gives to others, the more one possesses; the more one responds, the more one is fulfilled. As the foundation for all things and the reliance of transformation, the Sage rescues all without abandoning any, nurtures all without discarding any. When things come with sensation, the Sage aligns with them in natural harmony, yet never neglects; when things depart, the Sage rests with them in tranquility, yet never burdens. Those who dwell elsewhere take for themselves and receive, yet ultimately return to their origin. Those who dwell here achieve without taking, yet fundamentally incur no cost. All things—small or great—are completed in their proper measure, without claiming possession, simply resting therein.\n\nThe principles of the world: *\"The departing will depart, yet ultimately return; the deceased will die, yet ultimately revive.\"* The Dao lends to things, ending where it begins, ceasing yet never ending—hence it is called *qiě* (thus). The essence of the Dao is hidden in its namelessness, yet its function is to lend and complete effortlessly—this lies in diligent practice alone.\n\nIf one truly accumulates strength over time, one arrives at the formless and merges with the Dao, resting in the untransformed and enduring through ages eternal. The remaining matters suffice for governing the state and rectifying the world—its surplus is ample for imperial achievements. What is within us is not merely sufficient but abundant.\n\nThis section begins with the Superior Person hearing the Dao and practicing diligently, concluding that the Dao lends and completes effortlessly. Thus, from lower learning to higher attainment, those who excel as scholars all follow this path. Even Master Gu said: *\"Learning begins with becoming a scholar and ends with becoming a Sage.\"* This is what is meant.\n\n*End of Volume Eight of the Exegesis on the Dao De Jing*\n*Volume Nine of the Exegesis on the Dao De Jing*",

      "translated_text": "**Volume Nine of the Exegesis on the Dao De Jing (continued)**\n\n*Chapter 42: Dao Gives Rise to One*\n\n**Dao gives rise to One.**\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: At the beginning of all things, there is the indeterminate (無), which is nameless; this is where One originates.\nThe Exegesis states: There is the *Taiyi* (太易) and there is the *Tai’chu* (太初).\nThe *Taiyi* is the state before *qi* (氣) manifests.\nThe *Tai’chu* is the first emergence of *qi*.\nWhen it is called the *Tai’chu*, it is because it lies within the realm of the indistinct and formless, when the Dao transforms into *qi*—at that moment, not yet a single thing exists. Vast and empty, it is but indeterminate (無) alone. Thus, before the *Tai’chu*, there was nothing at all—this is the origin of indeterminacy (有無).\nAs Zhuangzi said, *\"indeterminacy\"* is what is called *wu* (無), for indeed, there was nothing.\nOnce it is said to be *wu* (無), then it is *wu’ming* (無名)—nameless.\nMoreover, Heaven has no fixed name for things; things arise and their names follow naturally. When their forms are complete and their numbers established, then their abundance or scarcity can be named.\nIn its state of *wu* (無), not yet a single thing exists, and not yet a single thing, then it is not something that can be sought through appearance, form, sound, or color. Who could name it?\nThe *Jing* (經) says, *\"The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\"* and again, *\"The Dao is ever nameless.\"*\nThus, the nameless indeterminacy (有無) is the essence of the Dao. The Dao’s essence is fundamentally indeterminate (無), yet it never neglects the determinate (有). Therefore, when it moves, it does not generate indeterminacy (無) but generates the determinate (有), manifesting its signs. When it shifts from indeterminacy to determinacy, numbers begin to establish themselves. Thus, the origin of One is rooted in the *Tai’chu*—this is the Dao descending and emerging.\nIf the Dao remains indeterminate (無), then it returns to the undifferentiated (浑沦), when *qi* has not yet appeared, and One cannot be obtained. This is what is meant by *\"At the beginning of all things, there is indeterminacy (有無), and indeterminacy is nameless (無名).\"* This is where One originates—just as Liezi said, *\"The easy transforms and becomes One.\"*\n\n**One gives rise to Two.**\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: Heaven is One, Earth is Two; water emerges, and fire follows; when the essence is complete, the spirit arises.\nThe Exegesis states: Heaven is noble, Earth is humble; *Yin* (乾) and *Kun* (坤) are thus defined, and so it is that there is Heaven and Earth, establishing differences between the high and low.\n*Yin* (乾) is Heaven, its number is odd.\n*Kun* (坤) is Earth, its number is paired.\nThus, the *Yijing* (易) refers to Heaven as One and Earth as Two. There is Heaven before there is Earth, and so Earth is Two following Heaven.\nWater is deep and empty; it takes form through the solid, and distinction comes later. It is represented in the *Hexagram* (卦) as *Kàn* (坎), which contains One. Hence, One is water.\nFire is restless and swift; it takes form through stillness, and unity comes later. It is represented in the *Hexagram* (卦) as *Lí* (離), which encompasses Two. Hence, Two is fire.\nFrom the Dao descending, water is nearly of the Dao, yet within water there is fire, succeeding in turn; thus, water is One, and fire is Two following it.\nHeaven, One, gives rise to water, which in things is the *jing* (精).\nEarth, Two, gives rise to fire, which in things is the *shen* (神).\nOnly the most refined essence in the world can become the most refined spirit in the world; thus, when a person is born, the *jing* (精) gathers the *shen* (神), and the body takes form.\nThe *jing* (精) is the foundation of the body; when the *jing* is complete, the *shen* reigns supreme. If one guards it and does not lose it, the *shen* and *jing* become one.\nTherefore, one who does not depart from the *jing* is called a *shen’ren* (神人)—this is what is meant by *\"when the essence is complete, the spirit arises.\"*\n\n**Two gives rise to Three.**\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: One combines with speech to become Two; Two combines with One to become Three.\nThe Exegesis states: Numbers begin with One, are established in Two, and completed in Three.\nOne is odd; alone, it does not generate.\nTwo is paired; alone, it does not complete.\nOne odd and One paired, and yet Three arises.\nWhen traced to its source, the Dao’s great origin is singular and without counterpart. Though myriad things exist, they are all of One with me.\nOnce it is called One, it cannot lack speech, so One is one thing, and speech is another thing—thus, One and speech become Two.\nOne is odd, Two is paired; odd and paired generate each other, so there is Two when there is Three—thus, Two and One become Three.\nFrom indeterminacy to determinacy, until it reaches Three, it is then gathered to extend toward the infinite—this is the natural progression of numbers, which cannot be altered.\n\n**Three gives rise to the myriad things.**\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: Heaven marks One at the North, Earth marks Two at the South, and the human takes form in Three. When the Three Principles are complete, the myriad phenomena are divided.\nThe myriad things are called \"ten thousand\" (万) by number; from this point onward, they cannot be counted exhaustively.\nThe Exegesis states: Once the undifferentiated is divided, the light and pure gather upward to form the *yang* (陽), and its number is odd, so Heaven marks One at the North.\nThe heavy and turbid descend and congeal to form the *yin* (陰), and its number is paired, so Earth marks Two at the South.\nYet Heaven governs the original *qi*, and Earth governs the original form; there must be one who governs the original awareness.\nHeaven’s role is to give birth and cover; Earth’s role is to bear and load; there must be one who takes charge of teaching and transforming.\nThus, Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the human takes form within them.\nWhen the Three Principles are complete, those rooted in Heaven belong to the high and associate upward—Heaven is clear and disperses.\nThose rooted in Earth belong to the low and associate downward—Earth is turbid and gathers.\nThe distinct clustering and separation of kinds, the varied states of flight, movement, plants, and growth—\nall arise in their ordered ranks, and the myriad phenomena are divided.\nCount all the myriad things in the world, and none do not arise from this; hence, the *Yijing* says, *\"Heaven and Earth exist, and then the myriad things are born.\"*\nFrom Three, the myriad things arise; from this point onward, even the most skilled cannot count them exhaustively.\nYet the myriad things are called \"ten thousand\" (万) because their multitude is named and spoken of—\nhow could one enumerate their teeming, tangled confusion? Can it be exhausted?\n\n**The myriad things bear *yin* and embrace *yang*, and the harmonizing *qi* unites them.**\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: *Yin* is still and quiet; the myriad things bear it, hence the Superior Person says, *\"Enter and rest.\"*\n*Yang* is fluid and accomplished; the myriad things embrace it, hence the Sage says, *\"Face the bright and govern.\"*\nThere must be the balance between *yin* and *yang*, and this is the harmonizing *qi*.",

      "translated_text": "Zhuangzi says: *\"The utmost *yang* blazes resplendent; the utmost *yin* stands solemn and grave.*\n*Solemn and grave* issues from Heaven, while *resplendent* arises from Earth. The two interact to form harmony, and thus the myriad things are born.\"\n\n**Exegesis says:** The luminous function of Heaven, manifesting all things, is called *yang*; the obscure, formless, and unfathomable is called *yin*. *Yang* moves and emits, while *yin* remains still and contracts, hence *yin* is still and quiet. *Yang* warms and flourishes, while *yin* congeals and restrains, hence *yang* is fluid and accomplished.\n\nSince *yin* is still and quiet, the myriad things that follow in its wake—all that is born—bear *yin* and face north. Since *yang* is fluid and accomplished, the myriad things that precede it—all that is born—embrace *yang* and turn south.\n\nBecause the myriad things bear *yin*, the Superior Person follows the principle of *yin*, hence he retires at dusk to rest, for night is the peak of *yin*—as the *Yijing* says: *\"The Superior Person, at the approach of evening, enters to rest in repose.\"* Because the myriad things embrace *yang*, the Sage faces the bright and governs, for day is the peak of *yang*—as the *Analects* say: *\"With reverence and rectitude, he faces south.\"*\n\nWithout *yin* and *yang*, there would be no harmonizing *qi*. The harmonizing *qi* takes Heaven’s One as its root and Heaven’s Five as its pivot. Without the harmonizing *qi*, there would be no supreme harmony—harmony that does not lean toward *yang* nor cling to *yin*, but remains in the balance of *yin* and *yang*.\n\nZhuangzi says: *\"The utmost *yang* blazes resplendent; the utmost *yin* stands solemn and grave.\"* Indeed, *yang* is bright while *yin* is obscure; *resplendent* ascends to the heights of supreme luminosity, the origin of the utmost *yang*; *yang* gives birth while *yin* destroys—*solemn and grave* enters the gates of profound darkness, the origin of the utmost *yin*.\n\n*Solemn and grave* issues from Heaven, and Heaven’s *qi* descends; *resplendent* arises from Earth, and Earth’s *qi* ascends. Heaven and Earth intermingle in vaporous transformation, and the myriad things refine into purity. The two interact to form harmony, and thus the myriad things are born.\n\nYang Xiong also said: *\"Heaven and Earth interact, and the myriad things are born.\"*\n\nWhat people detest—being solitary, orphaned, and impoverished—is what kings and lords take as their title.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** Things that are not exalted do not perish; affairs that are not at their peak do not decline. This is the operation of *yin* and *yang*, the principle of all things.\n\nEbb and flow, fullness and emptiness, proceed together without losing harmony—this is the way of the Sage alone. Thus, though solitary, orphaned, and impoverished are what people detest, kings and lords take them as their title. When things reach their extreme, they return; when they are full, they diminish—this is how one remains above without peril.\n\n**Exegesis says:** When things ascend to their peak, they descend; hence the high are brought low. When things reach their fullness, they decline; hence the abundant are diminished. Whether refined into *yin* and *yang* or dispersed as affairs and things, none escape this law: things that are not exalted do not perish; affairs that are not at their peak do not decline. This is the operation of *yin* and *yang*, the principle of all things.\n\nThe Sage delves into origins and knows subtleties, thus he consumes when it is time to consume, rests when it is time to rest. He follows the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness, preserves the great harmony, and moves with the times without deviation. Hence, though solitary, orphaned, and impoverished are names of lowly things, he takes them as his title without shame.\n\nFor the trends of the world, extremes must necessarily decline, but he guards his attainment without loss, knowing when to return at the peak. Though fullness must inevitably overflow, he holds his abundance without excess, knowing when to diminish at the point of saturation. Thus does he long endure in wealth and nobility, remaining above without peril?\n\nTherefore, things may be diminished to benefit, or benefited to diminish. **Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** When trees shed their leaves, their roots are fertilized—thus, diminution brings benefit. When the moon is full, it must be eclipsed—thus, addition brings diminution. Heaven and Earth follow the ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness; how much more so for humanity?\n\nThus, though solitary, orphaned, and impoverished are what people detest, kings and lords take them as their title. Though it seems self-diminishing, it is the way to achieve benefit and maintain noble elevation.\n\nWhat people teach is also what I teach. The overbearing and violent do not meet a good end. I shall make them my teaching father.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** To subdue the weak with strength, to conquer the gentle with rigidity—this is what people teach. What I teach is different.\n\nThe overbearing and violent have *yang* within them and love contention; thus, they have the way of death. The wise observe this and take it as a warning, hence I shall make them my teaching father.\n\n**Exegesis says:** In terms of affairs, the weak cannot resist the strong, nor can the gentle overcome the rigid—thus, to subdue the weak with strength, to conquer the gentle with rigidity, is what people teach.\n\nIn terms of the *Dao*, rigidity and strength dwell below, while gentleness and weakness dwell above—indeed, the gentle can overcome the rigid. If so, then my teaching is certainly different from that of others.\n\nThough my teaching differs from others’, what others teach is also my principle—only that what others teach pertains to affairs, while my teaching pertains to the *Dao*. Yet in using strength and weakness as lessons, they are one.\n\nFor the rigid and strong are doomed to perish, while the overbearing and violent have *yang* within them and love contention—thus, they have the way of death. The wise observe this and take it as a warning: *\"The wicked serve as a resource for the virtuous. When one sees the wicked, one must solemnly reflect upon oneself.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「Is this not the very principle of my teaching? *Chapter Forty-Three: The Supreme Gentleness of the World*\n\nThe supreme gentleness of the world can conquer the supreme rigidity of the world.\n\nThe *Huizong* annotation states: *\"The rigid will be destroyed, the sharp will be blunted. Only the Sage can accumulate the small to achieve the great victory.\"*\n\nThe *Shuyi* commentary explains: *\"The world has ways of constant victory and constant defeat. The way of constant victory lies in gentleness, while the way of constant defeat lies in rigidity.*\n\nIndeed, the way of constant victory lies in gentleness—this is why the ancient *Dao*’s true and magnanimous masters must embody meekness and humility as their outward expression.\n\nTo manifest as meek and humble, they root themselves in depth, having no need for rigidity, for rigidity invites destruction. They adhere to restraint, having no need for sharpness, for sharpness invites blunting. Thus, they do not engage with rigidity or sharpness, so others always take the lead, while they alone take the rear. Others always grasp what is solid, while they alone embrace what is empty. They yield to the overbearing and follow the winding paths of others, conforming to the flow of things like water in waves. In their emptiness and stillness, they never falter—this is what is meant by the supreme gentleness of the world.\n\nWhen it comes to governing all things and directing myriad movements, responding to the boundless, and drawing upon resources without depletion, turning the heavens and earth yet no one perceives its vigor, subduing the realm yet no one attributes it to force—this is also the supreme gentleness of the world, unstoppable in its conquest.\n\nZhuang Zhou’s discussion of accumulating small advantages to achieve great victory—only the Sage can do this—truly demonstrates profound insight into this principle.\n\nObserve the wind as it moves through the boundless void: it points at me and I conquer it; it adds to me and I conquer it. When it comes to stirring and swaying all things, none dare resist its command. Water, dwelling in gentleness, flows east when guided eastward, flows west when guided westward. Yet when it attacks rigidity and strength, none can precede it—this too exemplifies the idea of accumulating small to achieve great victory. Who would say the supreme gentleness of the world cannot conquer the supreme rigidity of the world?\n\nThere is no entering the boundless void.\n\nThe *Huizong* annotation states: *\"In the *Zhuangzi·Outer Chapters*, it discusses how the *Kui* snake and the wind and the eyes of the *Mu* target each other’s vulnerabilities, yet concludes with the eyes of the *Mu* targeting the heart. The foot’s movement is limited by distance, the eye’s sight by subtlety, but only the spirit is boundless in its reach.\"*\n\n*\"In the *Inner Chapters*, it speaks of the master of life-nurturing, and how much more so the butcher Ding’s art of dismembering an ox.\"*\n\n*\"Ding* is the yin aspect of fire and the manifestation of the spirit. Thus, his blade moves with ease, as if playing without effort.\"*\n\nIf so, then to enter the boundless void—is this not the domain of one who exhausts the formless and wanders without trace? Who else could grasp this?\n\nThe *Shuyi* commentary explains: *\"When things are constrained by form and *qi*, they are always limited by these very things. The *Kui* snake and the wind and the *Mu*’s eyes are each vulnerable in their own way, yet none can perceive the subtle, hidden movements of the great transformation, which unfolds silently in the depths, without action yet naturally so. They are enslaved by the craft of creation, yet cannot escape their inherent flaws or excesses.*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi·Outer Chapters* thus discusses how the *Kui* snake and the wind and the *Mu*’s eyes target each other’s vulnerabilities, yet concludes with the eyes of the *Mu* targeting the heart—all are constrained by their own limitations.\n\nThe foot’s movement is confined by near and far, its strength by reach; the eye’s gaze is limited by fine and coarse, its clarity by scope. But the spirit is profound and formless, its operations boundless—swift yet not hasty, reaching yet not forced. Its uses are wondrous, its transmission without limit, yet it never stagnates in form or body.\n\nThe spirit’s boundlessness is but emptiness itself. Through emptiness, it finds utility in both entering and exiting—thus, it is without limit and cannot be contained. Is this not precisely what is meant by having no entry into the boundless void?\n\nIn the *Inner Chapters*, it speaks of the master of life-nurturing, and how much more so the butcher Ding’s art of dismembering an ox. All things arise through their forms, yet the spirit governs them. The butcher’s task is to harmonize, thus nurturing life.\n\nThe earth gives birth to fire, which in humans becomes the spirit. *Ding*, the yin aspect of fire, is the manifestation of the spirit.\n\nWhen the spirit is employed, the butcher Ding’s art of dismembering an ox is realized. And when one encounters things with the spirit rather than the eye, halting the senses while the spirit acts freely—then the mind illuminates itself, and all *Dao*’s principles are attained. He splits great joints, guides great cavities, yet never falters, his blade moving with effortless grace. The ox is dismembered with ease, its pieces falling apart as if by themselves.\n\nEven the metaphor of the butcher’s blade—though thin and entering gaps—can still meet resistance. But what of one who has no form entering the boundless void? Then, the six orifices and four limbs are fully open, clear and penetrating, with no obstruction or hindrance at all. Only one who exhausts the formless, attains boundlessness, and leaves no trace of the *Dao* could achieve this.\n\nThus, one understands the benefits of *wuwei*—non-action.\n\nThe *Huizong* annotation states: *\"The gentleness overcomes rigidity, the void encompasses the having, and the wondrous uses of the *Dao* truly lie here. Abandoning action spares the body’s labor, neglecting life preserves the essence’s integrity—this is why it is beneficial.\"*\n\nThe *Shuyi* commentary explains: *\"The *Dao* is ever in non-action yet never fails to act. Non-action is the true, still essence of the *Dao*, unmoving in its nature. Never failing to act is the wondrous operation of the *Dao*, responding to all things without effort.\n\nOnly in its non-action yet never failing to act does the *Dao* achieve victory through gentleness, and encompass the having through the void. Its wondrous uses truly lie here.\n\nGentleness overcoming rigidity—this is what is meant by accumulating in gentleness to achieve rigidity. The void encompassing the having—this is what is meant by non-action generating the void, and the void giving birth to the having.\n\nIts uses are thus wondrous—how could one delight in forced action and labor? The operations of the *Dao* are measured and harmonious, emerging and responding as needed. Though myriad transformations arise, the principle of non-action remains unchanged.\n\nIf non-action is embraced, what need is there to abandon action? Why should one labor in vain?」",

Yet in using strength and weakness as lessons, they are one.\n\nFor the rigid and strong are doomed to perish, while the overbearing and violent have *yang* within them and love contention—thus, they have the way of death. The wise observe this and take it as a warning: *\"The wicked serve as a resource for the virtuous. When one sees the wicked, one must solemnly reflect upon oneself.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The principles of all things reach their peak and then decay—\nwhen deeds are accomplished, they return in cycles;\nwhen names are attained, they incur loss.\nOnly by not clinging to completion can one achieve it without decay.\n\nThus, the divine person has no deeds—\nnot because they lack deeds, but because they do not dwell on them when accomplished;\nthe Sage has no name—\nnot because they lack a name, but because they do not rely on it when attained.\nBy abandoning deeds and names and returning them to the common people,\nthey are called *as if incomplete*.\n\n*Great Completion* is *as if incomplete*—\nnot only does it not cling to its own completion,\nbut it also reveals its understanding of transformation and adaptation,\nwithout rigidly adhering to the old ways.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Those who know the Dao of transformation—\ndo they not know the workings of the numinous?\"*\n\nThe numinous has no fixed form—\nwithout fixed form, it transforms and nurtures to exhaust its changes,\nand through change, it harmonizes to exhaust its benefits.\nHow could it be bound by the old and constant,\nunable to adapt to the ebb and flow?\n\nThus, its use is inexhaustible.\n\nConfucius gathered the essence of *clearing, harmonizing, and fulfilling*—\nthe very moment of his sagehood—\nand this is why he attained it.\n\nTo *gather completion* is to strike like metal and resonate like jade—\nto strike like metal is to begin with order;\nto resonate like jade is to perfect that order.\n\nThe three Sages’ established ways—\nthis is what is meant by *resonating like jade*.\nTo hold fast to one principle without change\nis only to achieve its end.\n\nBut when one strikes like metal and resonates like jade,\nit is because they understand transformation and adaptation—\nthus able to complete both beginning and end.\nHence, it is said: *Great indeed is Confucius.*\n\n*Great fullness is as if empty*—\nits use is boundless.\n\nThe *Commentary of Xiuzong* says:\n*\"Filling all without limit, suffusing all existence—\nthis is great fullness.\nEmpty to respond to things, void yet applied—\nthus its giving never ceases, its use is boundless.\nA wise merchant hides his wealth as if empty,\nand great virtue appears as if simple.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"The true essence of the Dao encompasses the six extremes,\nvast yet containing all things without trace.\nThe subtle applications of the Dao flow through the six voids,\nbroad yet reaching everywhere without obstruction.\nThe Sage, attaining the Dao’s completeness,\nfills all without limit, covering all things unseen,\nsuffusing all existence, animating the masses—\nyet those who seek it find it inexhaustible,\nits fullness so profound it cannot be measured.\nYet if fullness cannot yield to emptiness,\nit cannot respond to things.\nOnly by the Dao’s emptiness meeting all things\ncan one apply it like a deep spring, flowing as needed.\n\nThus, filling it does not overflow,\ndrawing from it does not deplete,\ngiving it does not exhaust—\nthe more one gives to others, the more one possesses;\nthe more one shares, the more one has.\nIts use is boundless—\nhence, *great fullness is as if empty*.\n\nThough it has accumulation, it is insufficient.\nThough it has no hoarding, it overflows.\nThe perfected one has no accumulation—\nonly emptiness—\nthus those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.\n\nA wise merchant hides his wealth as if empty,\ngreat virtue appears as if simple—\nthis is why Laozi spoke thus to Confucius.\n\nTo have as if not having,\nto be real as if empty—\nthis is the scholar’s ultimate endeavor,\njust as the wise merchant hides his wealth.\n\n*Great whiteness is as if stained*,\ngreat virtue appears insufficient—\nhere lies the Sage’s emptiness and the gentleman’s demeanor.\n\nFrom this, one can infer:\n*Great fullness is as if empty*.\n\n*Great straightness is as if bent*—\nThe *Commentary of Xiuzong* says:\n*\"Following things’ transformations, yielding and winding,\nnot forcing one’s will—\nthus it appears bent.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say:\n*\"The Sage empties themselves to move through the world,\nadapting to every situation—\nnowhere does this fail to be straight,\nfor it follows things’ transformations.\nThus, winding yet unharmed,\ncurving yet unerring,\nyielding to strength, following turns—\nnever rigidly self-assertive.\nThough winding and turning,\nits alignment is beyond control—\nthis is *great straightness*, appearing bent.\n\nIt is said, *not forcing one’s will*—\nthis is the meaning, is it not?\n\nZhuangzi in *Human World* says:\n*'The inwardly straight align with Heaven,\nthe outwardly curved align with humanity.'*\nFor the world of humanity is to respond to others.\nIf inwardly aligned with humanity,\none cannot stand apart—\nthus, outwardly curved—\nand *great straightness is as if bent* becomes clear.*\n\n*Great skill is as if clumsy*—\nThe *Commentary of Xiuzong* says:\n*\"Shaping things’ forms—\nround, square, curved, straight—\ntheir artistry unseen,\nthus it appears clumsy.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes*

straight yet never straying from the plumb line—\nforms manifest, colors shine,\nyet no trace of the true master remains.\nThough round, square, curved, or straight,\neach exhausts its art—\nyet

      "translated_text": "「The Emperor Huizong annotates: *Learning seeks to attain the Dao/Way*, beginning with the cultivation of the scholar and culminating in the perfection of the Sage. With daily progress, the Dao accumulates within oneself. Confucius spoke to Yan Yuan, saying: *\"I see his advancement.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* (疏义) explains: *The Dao cannot be directly attained, yet there are things said to be attainable—only learning can achieve this.* Indeed, learning encompasses both the *Tian Dao* (天道, Heavenly Dao) and the *Ren Dao* (人道, Human Dao). One cultivates the desired virtues until they reach the ineffable divine, and practices filial piety until it manifests as the Sage’s Heavenly Dao—this is what the *Yǔ* (语) refers to as *\"the scholar attains the Dao through learning,\"* and what *Mòzǐ* (苟子) means by *\"beginning as a scholar, ending as a Sage.\"* Only when one earnestly pursues learning will they see daily gains and forget their past ignorance, monthly progress and retain their acquired knowledge. Though daily calculations may seem insufficient, yearly reflections will yield abundance, and the Dao will naturally reside within you. This is truly *\"daily advancement, the Dao accumulating within oneself.\"*\n\nYan’s son knew to emulate the lofty virtue of the *Jian Gao* (坚高), yet forgot the labor of striving upward. When asked about *ren* (仁), he diligently sought to practice it, and upon hearing its merits, he wholeheartedly embraced them without hesitation. Thus, Confucius said of him: *\"Daily I see his advancement.\"* Is this not fitting?\n\n*The Dao/Way is attained through daily diminishment.*\nThe Emperor Huizong annotates: *To attain the Dao is to abandon one’s physical form, discard sharp intellect, sever from the body and forget worldly affairs—thus it is called \"diminishment.\"*\n\n*Lian Boyu* (连伯玉) reached sixty years and yet transformed sixty times. The *Cushui* explains: *If one knows that the body is not truly one’s own possession but merely a borrowed shape from Heaven and Earth, then they will not be burdened by the body and thus abandon physical form.* If one understands that their lifespan is finite while knowledge is boundless, then they will not cling to cleverness and thus discard sharp intellect. By severing from the body, the body cannot hinder; by forgetting worldly knowledge, the mind is unconstrained. Neither internal fluctuations nor external conformity exist—when engaged in affairs, not a single hair’s worth is spared, yet all worldly concerns vanish. Thus, it is called *\"diminishment.\"*\n\n*Zhuāngzǐ* said: *\"Lian Boyu reached sixty years and yet transformed sixty times.\"* This means that with each passing year, he underwent transformation until, at sixty, he had transformed sixty times—truly one who forgets the passage of years and aligns with the natural *Hua* (化, transformation) of humanity.\n\nObserving Lian Boyu’s conduct, it is clear that the Master wished to minimize his faults yet could not fully achieve it—thus, *\"reaching sixty years and yet transforming sixty times\"* is understandable.\n\n*Diminish again, and again diminish,* until one attains *non-action* (无为) yet *achieves all* (无不为).\n\nThe Emperor Huizong annotates: *Learning exhausts principles and encompasses all things; the Dao fulfills one’s nature and reaches the ineffable.* To diminish again and again is to arrive at *non-being* (未始有). *Non-being* is *non-action*. In stillness, one remains unmoved—this is *non-action*. Yet one responds to all things and naturally harmonizes with the world’s patterns—this is *achieving all*.\n\n*To attain stillness within oneself is the Dao of inner Sagehood; to act and engage with the world is the work of outer Kingship.* Both originate from this principle, hence *Zhuāngzǐ* says: *\"Stillness leads to Sagehood, movement leads to Kingship.\"* This is followed by *non-action* (无为) to achieve *Zhēn* (尊, reverence).\n\nThus, those who take possession of the world often rely on *non-action* (无事). But once they engage in worldly affairs, they are no longer sufficient to possess the world.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong annotates: *The world is a great thing. Those who possess great things cannot be possessed by them; if one is possessed by things yet transcends them, then they can possess all things.* Those who take possession of the world often rely on *non-action*—this is clear.\n\n*The world is a divine instrument; it cannot be forced.* Those who force it ruin it, and those who cling to it lose it. Hence, once they engage in worldly affairs, they are no longer sufficient to possess the world.\n\nThe Sage embodies the Dao’s truth to govern themselves. The rise of an Emperor-King and the establishment of a King’s realm both occur when they respond to necessity. Even if they forget the world, the world will naturally submit to them—just as *Tàiwáng Zhí Fù* (太王直父) avoided harm from the *Dí* (狄) people, did not let nourishment injure his life, nor let profit burden his form, and thus established his kingdom beneath the *Qíshān* (岐山).\n\nThe *Cushui* explains: *If one is confined by things, there must be something beyond them to govern them. If one is enslaved by instruments, there must be something beyond instruments to command them.* Though the *Liùhé* (六合, the six directions—Heaven, Earth, and the four cardinal points) may seem vast, they are still confined by things. What transcends them is the Dao. Though instruments may seem powerful, they are still enslaved by them. What transcends instruments is the Dao. To embody the Dao is to have no worldly affairs—thus, their use of the world is abundant. This is what *Zhuāngzǐ* meant by *\"the world is a great thing; those who possess great things cannot be possessed by them, yet they possess all things.\"* Hence, it is clear that those who take possession of the world often rely on *non-action*.\n\nIf one does not embody the Dao, they will cling to affairs and thus be insufficient in their use of the world. The *Classics* say: *\"The world is a divine instrument; it cannot be forced. Those who force it ruin it, and those who cling to it lose it.\"* This is the case.\n\nThe Sage governs themselves with the truth of the Dao. The rise of an Emperor-King and the establishment of a King’s realm both occur when they respond to necessity. Even if they forget the world, the world will naturally submit to them—just as *Tàiwáng Zhí Fù* did not let nourishment injure his life, nor let profit burden his form, and thus avoided the *Dí* (狄) people’s calamity, establishing his kingdom beneath the *Qíshān*.\n\n*End of Volume Nine of the *Zhēn Dàodé* (真道德) Annotated Classic.*\n*Beginning of Volume Ten of the *Zhēn Dàodé* (真道德) Annotated Classic.*」",

life begins.\n\nFrom existence back to nonexistence,\nthen *form* transforms into *qi*,\n*qi* into *spirit*,\n*spirit* into *void*—\nHeaven’s *machine* contracts, and with it death ends.\n\nYet life is the beginning of death,\nand death is the completion of life—\nwhat dies here may yet live there,\nfor life and death are inconstant,\nand none know their measure.\nThus, the living are the initial workings of *Zao-hua*,\nand the dead are the transformations of *Yin-Yang*.\n\nThe initial workings of *Zao-hua* are called *refined qi forming matter*,\nthe transformations of *Yin-Yang* are called *wandering souls*.\n\nThose who follow life are thirteen in kind,\nthose who follow death are thirteen in kind.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nThose who follow life and death\nare bound by the mechanisms of emergence and return,\nand thus cannot escape their fate.\n\nThe commentary explains:\nWhen the Great Dao is obscured,\nit splits into many paths.\nThose who delight in life are burdened by form,\nyet they do not realize that the body is not their own—\nthey are ensnared by the Dao’s motion,\nleaning on the force of *Yin-Yang* to become followers of life.\n\nThose who seek stillness forget their bodies,\nyet they do not grasp the form of non-form—\nthey are drowned in the Dao’s tranquility,\nhalted in decay, and become followers of death.\n\nTo follow life and death,\none is already confined to the mechanisms of emergence and return,\nand thus cannot escape the bonds of life and death—\nboth are incomplete aspects of the Dao.\n\nThe numbers begin at One,\nare established at Two,\nand perfected at Three.\nHeaven and Earth combine to form Ten,\nso Three is the completion of numbers,\nand Ten is their fullness.\n\nThose who follow life and death\npursue their own desires,\nestablishing their own methods,\nand using numbers to justify them—\nthus, in their Ten, they attain only Three,\nfor those confined to the mechanisms of emergence and return\ncannot fully escape the cycles of *Yin-Yang*.\n\nThe people’s lives,\nwhen they stir toward death’s domain, are also thirteen in kind.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nThey blame fate while abandoning principle,\nforget life while pursuing gain—\nwhen the people’s lives stir toward death’s domain,\nwhat choice is there between life and death?\n\nThe commentary explains:\nLife is not my own,\nso those who blame fate are wrong.\nThus, those who understand the nature of life\ndo not labor for what life cannot provide—\nif one even blames fate while abandoning principle,\nthere are those who retain their form yet lose their life.\n\nLife is the radiance of virtue,\nso those who forget life are also wrong.\nThus, those who honor life\ndo not burden their bodies with profit—\nif one even forgets life while pursuing gain,\nthere are those with excess yet whose bodies are not nourished.\n\nThe common people are deeply confused and foolish,\nnot enlightened nor discerning—\nthey stumble blindly forward,\nfloundering in their vitality,\nrevering those who cherish life with great depth yet unaware of abandoning it,\nforgetting life while harming their nature, yet unaware of preserving it,\nseeking alms from the kitchen and begging at the walls—\nthey stir toward death’s domain,\nthough their forms may not yet perish, their hearts are already dead.\n\nZhuangzi called them *Xiao-ren*,\nYangzi called them *Ye-ren*—\nthese are they.\n\nThough they are called \"not dead,\" what benefit is it?\nThen their lives, what choice is there between life and death?\n\nWhy so?\nBecause of their excessive attachment to life.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\nThose who follow life delight in life yet burden their forms,\nthose who follow death seek stillness yet forget their bodies.\nWhen they stir toward death’s domain,\nthe crippled and the lame are everywhere,\nand the prisons and punishments are in sight—\nthese are all those who do not know\nthat the body is a great affliction,\nthat life is limited,\nand who err in their excessive reverence for living.\n\nThe ancient ones who attained the Dao\ndid not let wealth and honor harm their bodies,\nnor did poverty and lowliness burden them with gain—\nthey did not rejoice in longevity,\nnor lament in early death,\nthey awoke to solitude and saw the One,\nthus they could transcend past and present\nand enter the realm of neither life nor death.\n\nThe commentary explains:\nThe Dao is not made clear\nbecause the wise overreach it,\nand the unworthy fall

upon creatures without fear,\nand none can harm them.\n\nTherefore, they do not encounter rhinoceros or tiger,\nand wild beasts cannot harm them.\nThey do not wear armor or wield weapons,\nand blades

possessing,\nto act without claiming,\nto grow without controlling—\nthis is called the **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nTo generate is to manifest through movement and emergence,\nto act is to embody through transformation and change,\nto grow is to manifest through unification and singularity—\nwhen the Dao descends into the world,\nit resides in **virtue** alone.\n\nYet to generate without possessing its work,\nto act without claiming its ability,\nto grow without seeing its meticulous craft—\nunless one’s **virtue** is profound yet subtle,\nwho could comprehend this?\n\nThus it is called the **Mysterious Virtue**.\nThe annotation explains:\nZhuangzi says, *\"The luminous arises from the obscure\"*—\nthis implies returning to the hidden to reach the manifest,\nso there is the meaning of \"manifesting through emergence.\"\n\nThe *Yijing* says, *\"Transformation and change are called 'acting'*\"*—\nacting means to create and never cease,\nso there is the meaning of \"embodying through change.\"\n\nThe Classic says, *\"The Sage employs it to become an official and leader\"*—\nto lead is to hold noble rank and gain the people’s trust,\nso there is the meaning of \"manifesting through unification.\"\n\nThese three aspects—\nwhen the Dao descends into the world,\nthey reside in **virtue** alone.\n\nThe one who generates does so without ownership,\nthe one who transforms does so without attachment—\nno desire for gain,\nthis is called **generating without possessing its work**.\n\nThe one who harmonizes all things does so without seeking righteousness,\nthe one whose benevolence extends to all ages does so without claiming virtue—\nno pride or self-aggrandizement,\nthis is called **acting without claiming its ability**.\n\nThe one who covers and sustains Heaven and Earth,\nwho carves and shapes all forms—\nwithout displaying the skill of their craft,\nthis is called **growing without seeing its meticulous craft**.\n\nUnless one’s **virtue** is profound yet subtle,\nwho could comprehend this?\n\nThus it is called the **Mysterious Virtue**.\nBecause the profound is subtle yet small.\n\n---\n\nThe world has a **beginning**, which is called the **Mother of the World**.\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nThe **beginning** without name is Heaven and Earth,\nthe **Mother** with name is all things—\nboth the **beginning** and the **Mother** are the Dao.\nFrom the **beginning** of *qi*, it is called **beginning**,\nfrom the **generation** of all things, it is called **Mother**—\nto have a **beginning** is to be able to generate.\n\nThe annotation explains:\nBefore Heaven and Earth were born, the Dao was there.\nThe Dao is always nameless,\nso it is called the **beginning** without name.\nWhen the Dao descends into the realm,\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest—\nonly after Heaven and Earth exist do all things arise,\nso it is called the **Mother** with name.\nThe Classic says, *\"To know the ancient origins is called 'the Dao’s principle'*\"*,\nand *\"It can serve as the **Mother of the World**'*\"*—\nthus, the **beginning** and the **Mother** are both names for the Dao.\n\nThe **beginning** refers to the **origin of *qi***,\nthe **generation** of all things is called *Yijing* (change),\nand it is called the **Mother of the World**—\nthis is spoken of from the perspective of generation.\nThese two arise from the same source but have different names,\nboth called the Dao—\nso the words **beginning** and **Mother** are like fishhooks.\n\nWithout a **beginning**, it enters into non-generation;\nwith a **beginning**, it can generate.\nTo call it the **Mother of the World** is to say it lies in having a **beginning**.\n\nOnce one obtains its **Mother**, one knows its **children**.\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nThe Dao can **mother** all things and name them,\nso things are its **children**.\nThose who understand the Dao also understand all things,\nso by obtaining its **Mother**, one knows its **children**.\n\nThe annotation explains:\nThe Classic says, *\"The Dao generates them\"*—\nthus the Dao can **mother** all things and name them.\nAll things arise from the Dao,\nso the Dao is their **Mother**, and things are its **children**.\nThose who do not understand the Dao cannot harmonize all things;\nthose who understand the Dao can harmonize all things.\nIf one truly knows the Dao,\nthen the principles of all things are known without needing recognition—\nso by obtaining its **Mother**, one knows its **children**.\nOnce one knows its **children**, one again guards its **Mother**,\nand thus one’s life is never in peril.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\nExcessive knowledge leads to guarding it with restraint,\nexcessive observation leads to guarding it with precision—\nto exhaust the principles of things without being burdened by them,\nto reach the Dao’s full extent without losing its subtlety,\nthen one’s use of emergence and retreat is advantageous,\nand one’s coming and going never ends—\none can preserve life, fulfill one’s years,\nand avoid danger and peril.\n\nThe annotation explains:\nThe Dao does not desire mixture;\nmixture leads to excess,\nexcess leads to disturbance—\nso by understanding unity, all affairs are complete.\nThus, the Dao’s essence is not in complexity;\nthe more one hears and sees,\nthe less one can rely on simplicity.\n\nThe Classic says, *\"Fewer things, the more one gains\"*—\nMencius says, *\"Returning to the concise is the way of simplicity.\"*\nBy this, one exhausts the principles of things—\nthen one’s broad vision sits in clarity without being burdened by them;\nby this, one reaches the Dao’s full extent—\nthen though things are chaotic and myriad, one does not lose its subtlety.\nThus one can emerge or retreat without disadvantage,\ncome or go without exhausting the Dao.\nTo drift in ease, to rest in comfort—\nthe way of preserving life and fulfilling years is achieved,\nand there should be no danger or peril.\n\nThough few in knowledge, one lacks restraint;\nfew in observation, one lacks precision—\nso one must first know its **children**,\nthen one can guard its **Mother**.\n\nBlock the **Treasure of *Yui***,\nclose its **Gate**,\nand one’s life will never be weary.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation says:\n*Yui* means delight,\n**Gate** means exit—\nwhen things entice from without,\nthe heart delights within.\nEyes, ears, nose, and mouth—\nthe spirit and intelligence emerge from them.\nGuard your inner self,\nclose your outer senses—\ndo not take pleasure in harmonizing things,\nand things cannot lure you—\nthen one delights in Heaven and finds self-satisfaction.\nWho would toil endlessly for things?",

      "translated_text": "**Thick with Virtue** compares to the infant.\n\nThe **Huizong Commentary** says: Only when a person’s virtue is profound does their nature not shift with things. Thick with virtue, they do not stray with things, thus their *qi* is concentrated and their will is singular.\n\nMencius said: The noble person does not lose the heart of an infant.\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: Who among those born with innate nature does not cherish this virtuous excellence? Yet when they interact with others, few can uphold it.\n\nOnly when virtue is profound does one speak of its root in nature. If one strays with things, then nature is submerged in artifice.\n\nOnly those thick with virtue do not see strange things and stray from them. Not straying with things, their *qi* is concentrated and their will is singular.\n\nThus **Liezi** said: In infancy, *qi* is concentrated and will is singular—this is the utmost harmony. Things cannot harm them, and no virtue surpasses them.\n\n*Qi* is empty and awaits things; when concentrated, it is still and unmixed—this aligns with the *Classic*’s “concentrating *qi* to govern softness.”\n\nWill is where the mind directs itself; when singular, it is unified and not divided—this aligns with Confucius’ “as one whose will is singular.”\n\nWhen *qi* is concentrated and will is singular, constant virtue does not depart, and one returns to infancy—thus Mencius praised the noble person who does not lose the heart of an infant.\n\nIndeed, fulfilling one’s nature is the noble person’s affair. To fulfill one’s nature is to be substantial yet not lose the source of emptiness, to act yet not lose the basis of stillness—this is the infant’s purity without deficiency, truth without artifice. What need for choice?\n\nThus the great person dwells in profundity, not shallowness. Poisonous creatures do not sting, fierce beasts do not seize, snatching birds do not strike.\n\nThe **Huizong Commentary** says: Those thick with virtue have no place for worry to enter, no room for perverse *qi* to attack—thus nothing can harm them.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said: If a person can empty themselves to engage with the world, who can harm them?\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: The world values the infant because they are still and unchanging, pure and unadulterated, free from the fear of misfortune, unburdened by perverse *qi*.\n\nThick with virtue compares to the infant—thus worry cannot enter, perverse *qi* cannot attack. Worry comes from without, hence “enter.” Perverse *qi* seizes gaps, hence “attack.” If worry cannot enter, their virtue is whole; if perverse *qi* cannot attack, their spirit is unharmed.\n\nIf so, calamity does not come, fortune does not arrive—unmoved by things’ gains and harms, thus nothing can harm them. If nothing can harm them, they have nothing to oppose, reaching the utmost emptiness.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said: If a person can empty themselves to wander in the world, who can harm them? Indeed, the utmost emptiness leaves no opening for things—like an empty boat struck by currents, even those with narrow minds do not anger.\n\nIf a person attains emptiness to wander among worldly affairs, yielding and conforming like flowing water, who can harm them? This is how the perfected one’s mind works like a mirror—neither grasping nor resisting, responding without storing, thus able to overcome things without harm. This too is emptiness.\n\nBones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm. They do not know the union of male and female yet are aroused—this is the utmost *jing*.\n\nThe **Huizong Commentary** says: When virtue is whole, form is whole, hence bones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm. When form is whole, spirit is whole, hence they do not know the union of male and female yet are aroused. The utmost *jing* can enter the spirit—**Zhuangzi** said: The Sage values *jing*.\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: Life is the radiance of virtue; to preserve virtue is to preserve form—this is “virtue whole, form whole.” The body is the dwelling of the spirit; to preserve form is to preserve spirit—this is “form whole, spirit whole.”\n\nWhen virtue is whole, form is whole, hence bones are weak, sinews supple, yet their grip is firm—because their form is generated without exhaustion, they do not know where to take hold, yet their grip is firm. This differs from laboring the form without rest, leading to exhaustion.\n\nWhen form is whole, spirit is whole, hence they do not know the union of male and female yet are aroused—because their spirit is whole and unharmed, they do not know what to unite with, yet they are aroused. This differs from overusing *jing* without cessation, leading to depletion.\n\nWithout the utmost *jing*, who could achieve this? Only the utmost *jing* in the world can merge with the utmost spirit of the world. The utmost *jing* can enter the spirit, thus *jing* and spirit merge without separation.\n\n**Zhuangzi** said: The Sage values *jing*—because the singular *jing* harmonizes with the natural order. If a person harmonizes with the natural order, they are also the natural order itself. This is why the Sage values *jing*.\n\nWhen **Zhuangzi** discusses nurturing the spirit, his words touch on valuing *jing*—is this not because spirit and *jing* arise from the Dao, and form originates from *jing*? Is there not truth in this?\n\nTo cry all day yet the voice does not grow hoarse—this is the utmost harmony.\n\nThe **Huizong Commentary** says: Attaining singularity is called *jing*; *jing* means virtue is whole and spirit is unharmed. Pure *qi* achieves harmony, thus harmony means *qi* is whole and the voice does not grow hoarse.\n\nA person’s life receives *jing* from Heaven’s One to become the source of wisdom, and harmony from Heaven’s Five to become the foundation of trust. When perfected, they can enter the spirit, can restore their vital command.\n\nBut those who lose the heart of an infant—*jing* wavers and is not preserved, *qi* erupts and is not pure, they abandon their innate nature, submerging it in myriad things. Is this not tragic?\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: All things transform through *jing* and take form; they receive One to live. Concentrating One is called *jing*. Attaining singularity means not being divided—this aligns with the *Yijing*’s “speaking of attaining singularity.”\n\n*Jing* is the utmost rectitude of Heaven’s virtue; preserving *jing* means virtue is whole and spirit is unharmed—this is “their Heavenly Guard is whole, their spirit has no flaws.”\n\nAll things bear yin and embrace yang; obtaining the balance of yin and yang, pure *qi* achieves harmony.",

      "translated_text": "The harmonizing *qi* interflows and achieves balance—this aligns with Zhuangzi’s account of the harmonious *qi* as the essence of humanity.\n\nBalance, when expressed, is always measured and harmonious. When balance is attained, *qi* is whole and the throat does not constrict—this is what is meant by: *\"The elder brother cries all day but his throat never constricts; this is the ultimate of harmony.\"*\n\nHuman life begins when *jing* is received from Heaven’s One, becoming the root of wisdom, and when balance is attained from Heaven’s Five, becoming the foundation of sincerity.\n\nIndeed, *jing* is what the One generates; it is received from Heaven’s One as water, corresponding to the North in direction, and thus becomes the root of wisdom. Balance is what *qi* attains; it is received from Heaven’s Five as earth, residing centrally in position, and thus becomes the foundation of sincerity.\n\nWhen humans are born, they embody the five phases, from Heaven’s One to Heaven’s Five, and the numbers of their formation are complete. If one truly preserves the One and dwells in balance, and further cultivates the self, they may live a thousand two hundred years without ever decaying in form.\n\nWhen they attain this state, can they not enter the spirit and restore their vital command?\n\nTo enter the spirit is to attain the ineffable—this is what is meant by *\"the profound essence entering the spirit.\"*\n\nTo restore the vital command is to return to stillness—this is what is meant by *\"stillness is called restoring the vital command.\"*\n\nYet the world’s people lose their infantile heart because their *jing* wavers and is not preserved, their *qi* erupts and is not pure. How much more could they know of not letting their *jing* waver, preserving it and not losing it, and not letting their *qi* erupt, making it pure and unharmed?\n\nInstead, they abandon their innate nature to harm their life, submerging themselves in myriad things to drown their desires. Their self-abandonment is so extreme—is this not tragic?\n\n**Knowing harmony is constancy.**\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"The preservation of pure qi, with vital command governed within, form transforms while nature does not perish.\"*\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: *\"Balance is the great harmony with all things.\"*\n\nGuan Yin’s discourse on the Perfect One, who walks above all things without fear, states: *\"This is the preservation of pure qi.\"*\n\nIf one can preserve their *qi*, making it pure and unadulterated, then its gentle harmony is evident.\n\nOnly when harmony is perfected can one traverse the beginning and end of all things, and communicate with the creation of all things—this is what is meant by *\"vital command governed within, form transforms while nature does not perish.\"*\n\nWhen vital command is governed within, creation originates from oneself, enduring through all ages and eternally existing.\n\nWhen form transforms while nature does not perish, one nature remains constant, enduring myriad forms without change, encompassing Heaven and Earth, inheriting the primal *qi*—how could this not be called constancy?\n\n**Knowing constancy is clarity.**\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Clarity suffices to perceive the Dao because it knows nature does not perish.\"*\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: *\"The *Transmission* says: Inner vision is called clarity.\"*\n\nClarity suffices to perceive the Dao—this is beyond the reach of mere sight. Above form, one gazes with spirit alone, still and returning to the origin, awakening to see the singular. Then one knows that nature abides within, eternally fixed since antiquity.\n\nAs in the *Yijing*: *\"Nurturing nature, nature abides—this is the gateway to Dao and virtue.\"*\n\nBecause nature abides, its abiding is the gateway to Dao and virtue, then Heaven and Earth are born from it—even Heaven and Earth depend on this to be born. How could clarity not suffice to perceive the Dao, knowing that nature does not perish?\n\n**Augmenting life brings omens.**\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Omens are the presages of things; the principle of generating life, when augmented, becomes superfluous—fortune and misfortune are yet undetermined.\"*\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: *\"Divine omens manifest as signs; knowing how to respond, omens are the presages of things. Fortune and misfortune are already foretold—how could one escape their response?\"*\n\nMoreover, the generation of things is complete in its own principle. To augment it only adds excess, like hastening the growth of seedlings—this is to encourage what is already complete. These are all instances of humans aiding Heaven, yet fortune and misfortune remain undetermined.\n\nOnly by following nature without augmentation, without letting likes and dislikes internally harm the body, can one attain Heaven’s fullest bestowal.\n\n**The heart directs *qi* as strength.**\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"When the body aligns with the heart, and the heart aligns with *qi*, then *qi* is harmonious and does not erupt. The stumbling and rushing are *qi*—yet the heart truly compels this strength.\"*\n\nTo contend with things in this way is not the path of self-mastery.\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: *\"The body is the heart’s dwelling.\"*\n\nWhen the body aligns with the heart, all actions of the four limbs are rooted in the heart. The heart is the sovereign of *qi*.\n\nWhen the heart aligns with *qi*, then cultivating the mind in stillness allows *qi* to merge with emptiness. Kang Changzi said: *\"If the body aligns with the heart and the heart aligns with *qi*, then in the way of nurturing *qi*, one knows its foundation.\"*\n\nOnly when *qi* is properly nurtured can it be harmonious and not erupt, achieving ultimate softness.\n\nNow, the stumbling and rushing—when walking, they do not conform to Xia Wu’s measured steps, and when moving, they do not conform to the graceful *Shao Hao*—all are the result of erupting *qi*.\n\nIf stumbling and rushing persist, even if the leader of *qi* is at fault, it is truly the heart that compels it—this is what is called *\"strength.\"* To contend with things in this way means joy aligns with yang and anger aligns with yin, yet this is not the path of self-mastery. How could people know that harmony and softness suffice to pacify things, making them unable to harm?\n\n**When things flourish, they age—this is called not the Dao.**\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"The Dao knows no past or future, yet things have flourishing and aging, strength has its time of weakness, and prosperity has its time of decline. They are enslaved by time and governed by fate—how could this be the Dao?\"*\n\nThe **Exegesis** says: *\"There are those who live, and those who give life; there are those with form, and those who shape form.

      "translated_text": "The scholar Jiang Cheng of the Imperial Academy expounds:\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Wise Do Not Speak**\n*\"The wise do not speak; those who speak do not know.\"*\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"The Dao has no questions; questions have no answers. Thus, those who know the Dao remain silent and intuitively grasp it, having no need to speak.\"*\n\nYiqié questioned Wangni, yet through four inquiries and four unknowns, his words exhausted themselves, and he grew distant from the Dao.\n\n**Exegesis:**\nWhat can be articulated is but the coarse nature of things.\nWhat can be intuited is the refined essence of things.\nThe Dao’s supreme refinement is profound and inscrutable—though one might wish to speak of it, words fail to capture it, hence there are no questions.\n\nFor there is an entrance to the Dao, one may question it.\nBut the Dao itself has no entrance—who can question it?\nFor there are questions, one may respond to them.\nBut the Dao itself has no questions—who can respond to it?\nThus, those who seek answers to questions about the Dao do not know the Dao.\nThe sage explains this by saying:\n*\"The Dao can be received by spirit but not transmitted through speech;\nit can be intuitively grasped by the heart but not sought through outward traces.\"*\nSo, the ultimate speech transcends speech,\nand attains the mystery of silence—\none must remain silent and intuitively grasp it.\n\nIf one sees the Dao with the eyes, it remains stored within—\nhow can it be contained by sound?\nWhat need then for speech?\n\nThe *Yijing* speaks of *\"silent and it is accomplished\"*,\nLiezi speaks of *\"silent and it is attained\"*—\nthis is the very meaning.\n\nIn the past, when Yiqié questioned Wangni,\nhe first asked of what all things are the same—\nWangni did not know.\nThen he asked of knowing what one does not know—\nWangni did not know.\nNext he asked of things having no knowledge—\nWangni did not know.\nFinally, he asked of knowing not being ignorance and ignorance not being knowing—\nWangni did not know.\nFour questions, four unknowns.\n\nNot that he did not know—\nrather, knowing was shallow, ignorance profound;\nknowing was external, ignorance internal—\nhis unknown was the true knowing.\n\nBut those who cling to words,\nentangled in endless speech, cannot escape confusion—\nwho knows that the Dao cannot be spoken of,\nand yet speech is inevitable?\n\nBlock its *fuè* [receptive/outward aspect],\nclose its entrance—\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Dull the senses and preserve the spirit; withdraw and hide in secrecy.\"*\n\n**Exegesis:**\nFor those whose outward aspect is confused,\none cannot grasp them through excessive speech\nto lead them to the inward essence;\nfor those whose inward aspect is confused,\none cannot entangle them in convoluted speech\nto lead them to the outward essence.\nBlock its *fuè*, then there is no confusion of inward and outward,\nand the harmonious joy flows freely without losing its receptivity.\n\nIn sleep, the *hun* [ethereal soul] mingles;\nin waking, the form opens.\nEngaging with others brings discord—\nit is called *\"fighting with the heart\"*—\nclose its entrance, then there is no peril of heart-fighting.\nThe well-closed cannot be opened without a key.\n\nThis is what Zhuangzi called *\"dull the senses and preserve the spirit,\"*\nand what the *Yijing* called *\"withdraw and hide in secrecy.\"*\n\nFor dulling the senses brings clarity to the Dao’s inscrutable depth,\nunlured by things, one can thus embrace the spirit in stillness\nand merge with it—\nthis is called *\"blocking its fuè.\"*\n\nHiding in secrecy returns to the origin of nature,\nwhere nothing enters of its own accord—\none can thus conceal within heaven and merge with heaven—\nthis is called *\"closing its entrance.\"*\n\nGuangchengzi said:\n*\"Guard your inward self,\nseal your outward self,\ndull its sharpness,\nunravel its confusion.\"*\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Take depth as root,\ntake restraint as measure.\"*\n\n**Exegesis:**\nSharpness is like fire’s form—\nit cannot avoid injury,\nbut if dulled, it will not harm.\nConfusion is like tangled threads—\nit cannot avoid disorder,\nbut if unraveled, it will not be disordered.\nThis is what Zhuangzi called *\"take depth as root,\ntake restraint as measure.\"*\n\nFor depth aligns with the *Yijing*’s *\"ultimate depth and probing the subtle\"*—\ntaking depth as root means one does not follow superficial trends,\ninteracting with things without harming them,\nand things cannot harm one—\nthis is called *\"dull its sharpness.\"*\n\nRestraint aligns with Mencius’ *\"guard restraint while applying breadth\"*—\ntaking restraint as measure means one does not drown the heart in excess,\nthough myriad affairs unfold before one,\nyet cannot enter to merge—\nthis is called *\"unravel its confusion.\"*\n\nHarmonize its radiance,\nalign with its dust—\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Follow things with flexibility,\nand conform to their currents.\"*\n\n**Exegesis:**\nHarmonize refers to its non-defiance;\nalign refers to its non-separation.\nHarmonizing its radiance means radiance without dazzle—\nnot like the formed and polished that produces light.\nAligning with its dust means great unity with things—\nnot like those who withdraw from the world and differ from customs.\nThis is Zhuangzi’s *\"follow things with flexibility and conform to their currents.\"*\n\nOnly by shifting with the times,\nand rising or falling with the world,\nflexing and yielding without clashing with things,\nnever setting oneself apart in rigid distinction,\ncan one attain this.\n\nThis is called *Xuántóng* [Mysterious Unity].\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"The Dao returns to the utmost profound,\nand unites with the utmost singular—\nthe utmost profound is called Mysterious,\nthe singular is called Unity.\nMysterious Unity means all things and I,\nyet choosing among them is impossible—\nhow could one secretly entangle oneself in distinctions of near and far,\nbenefit and harm,\nnobility and lowliness?\"*\n\n**Exegesis:**\nEntering the inscrutable gate,\nconcealing the Dao without revealing it—\nthis is returning to the utmost profound.\nMerging in the primal chaos,\ngathering all into one Dao—\nthis is uniting with the utmost singular.\nReturning to the utmost profound,\nit dwells in subtle transformations—\nsmall yet wondrous—\nhence the term *Mysterious*.\nUniting with the utmost singular,\nit encompasses all distinctions—\ndifferent yet unified—\nhence the term *Unity*.\n\nOnly when the small merges with things,\nobtaining their singularity and aligning with it,\ndoes one know that things are inherently without things,\nand I am not truly I—\nwhen things and self are both forgotten,\nall things and I become one,\nand choosing among them is impossible—\nhow could one secretly entangle oneself in near and far,\nbenefit and harm,\nnobility and lowliness?\n\nFor all distinctions are originally non-existent—\none cannot attain to be near,\none cannot attain to be distant,\none cannot attain to benefit,\none cannot attain to harm,\none cannot attain to nobility,\none cannot attain to lowliness—\nthus one is noble for all under heaven.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"The world’s people attack each other with love and hate,\nand thus have attitudes of nearness and distance.\nEmotions and pretense influence each other,\nand thus distinctions of benefit and harm arise.\nActions vie for advantage,\nand thus divisions of nobility and lowliness emerge.\nThese fluctuate endlessly,\nnever reaching an end—\nhow can they suffice to be noble for all under heaven?\"*",

agriculture.\"*\n\nIn the age of supreme virtue,\nthe people are simple and unadorned,\nknowing only the daily necessities of food and drink—\nwho among them would have the skill for elaborate cleverness?\n\nIndeed, if cleverness prevails,\npeople will turn to frivolous pursuits,\nand thus strange garments and odd instruments will emerge to disrupt customs.\n\nThe ancient rulers governed by this principle:\nwhenever strange garments or odd instruments were sold in the marketplace\nor brought into the palace,\nthere were fixed punishments to uphold the essential\nand suppress the frivolous,\nso that the people might return\nto the honest and steadfast customs of old.\n\nAs laws and decrees grow stricter,\nthieves and robbers multiply.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"If strictness becomes excessive,\nthere will inevitably arise hearts that defy it.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:\n*\"To observe the deep fish is an ill omen,\nto outwit the hidden is to invite calamity;\nthus, once laws are established, deceit arises,\nand once decrees are issued, trickery flourishes.*\nIf one merely taxes a few bushels of grain\nand multiplies laws to oppress the people,\none will not stop theft—\nfor theft will persist.\nThis is what *Zhuangzi* meant when he said:\n*'If strictness becomes excessive,\nthere will inevitably arise hearts that defy it.'*\nThis is the truth of it.\n\nThe people, being simple and unknowing,\nif treated gently will submit,\nif oppressed will seek vengeance—\nunless the ruler governs with benevolence,\nwho would willingly reform and avoid crime?\n\nThus, the Sage governs through policy,\naligns through punishment,\nand the people escape punishment yet feel no shame.\n\nHence, the Sage declares:\n*\"I act without action, and the people transform themselves.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"Heaven governs without action and remains clear,\nEarth governs without action and remains tranquil;\nwhen these two—without action—harmonize,\nall things naturally transform.\nThe Sage follows Heaven and Earth alone,\nso the people reform without knowing who guides them.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:\n*\"Heaven’s movement is without action,\nyet its clarity is pure and unadulterated—\nit nurtures life and covers all without fail.\nEarth’s dwelling is without action,\nyet its stillness is unchanging—\nit bears form and sustains all without omission.\nPure and unadulterated clarity is evident,\ntranquil stillness is evident—\nall this comes from attaining the Way of non-action.\nHeaven and Earth blend in their non-action,\nand all things transform and arise.\nObserving Heaven and Earth reveals the Sage—\nwhat need is there for action?\nThe Sage merely follows Heaven and Earth.*\n\nThus, the violent and fierce transform into the yielding,\nthose who bend to private interests transform into the public-spirited,\nand all who harbor criminal intent\nare led to pursue their own solitary ambition—\nthe people daily reform,\nyet do not know who guides them.\n\n*\"I cherish stillness, and the people align themselves.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"The balance’s interaction with form\nrequires no contrivance of skill,\nyet straight and round, curved and right cannot escape it—\nhow much more so does it need hooks, cords, or measuring tools\nbefore things can be made straight?\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:\n*\"If the balance is clear, dust and filth cannot cling;\nif the water is still, even whiskers and eyebrows are reflected.\nThe balance and the water achieve this\nbecause they remain singular and unchanging,\nsteady and responsive in nature.\nThe *Classic* says:\n*'The balance’s interaction with form\nrequires no contrivance of skill,\nyet straight and round, curved and right cannot escape it'—*\nthis speaks of its stillness.\nThe Sage’s use of the heart\nis like this:\nhe guards stillness with unwavering devotion,\nyet does not let movement disrupt his nature—\nsimply following his natural course,\nundisturbed and unruffled.\nHow much more so does he need hooks, cords, or measuring tools\nbefore things can be made straight?\"*\n\nThus, the Way of governance values clarity and stillness,\nand the people naturally align themselves.\nThe *Classic* states:\n*\"Clarity and stillness are the rectification for all under heaven.\"*\n\n*\"I act without interference, and the people grow rich.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"The world is originally without interference—\nit is only the vulgar who disturb it.\nIf one does not disturb it,\nthe people will naturally grow rich.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:\n*\"To govern a great nation is like cooking a small fresh fish—\nif one overcooks it, the fish spoils;\nif one overgoverns the people, they become confused.\nThe Sage pardons all under heaven,\nforgetting distinctions in Dao/Way and skill,\nlike fish forgetting the rivers and lakes—\nthen there is no interference,\nand life flourishes in order.\nIs not the Way of enriching the people\nfound in this absence of interference?\nYet the world is originally without interference—\nit is only the vulgar who disturb it.\nThose who later alter the ancient ways\nand disrupt the established order to invite disaster\ndo not understand the Way of enriching the people.\"*\n\n*\"I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"If one does not prize the virtuous,\nthe people will not vie for them;\nif one does not value hard-to-obtain goods,\nthe people will not become thieves—\nthis aligns with having no desires,\nand thus the people’s nature is preserved.\"*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s commentary explains:\n*\"To promote the virtuous leads the people to compete;\nthus, by not prizing the virtuous,\nthe people do not vie for them.\nHard-to-obtain goods provoke obstruction;\nthus, by not valuing hard-to-obtain goods,\nthe people do not become thieves.\nIf one does not prize the virtuous\nand does not value goods,\nthen the people see nothing to desire.\nThe Sage’s use of the heart\naligns with having no desires—\nthis is called *substance-simplicity*,\nand substance-simplicity preserves the people’s nature.\n\n*Substance-simplicity* is the complete embodiment of the Dao,\nbefore it disperses into things.\nIf the people return to their simplicity,\nthey see the Dao and not things,\nand what they see surpasses what they merely observe.\nIf one cannot abandon desires and dispel longings,\none will still be ensnared by things—\none will still be bound by the threads of artificiality,\none will still be enslaved by the schemes of others—\nthen the people lose their simplicity,\ndrowning in human artifice—\nhow could they ever restore the ancient winds of virtue?\"\n\nThe *Laozi* wrote:\n*\"Do not see what is desirable,\nso

matters as brilliance (*窃窃然以苛为明*), the very essence of *clear and strict* governance.\"\n\nThe *Commentary* explains:\n\"The key to governance lies in the *Dao*, which must not be burdensome.\nThe Sage governs through the *Dao* in the world,\nby assuming the utmost *emptiness* (*至虚*) to welcome the myriad forms of reality,\nand by embodying the utmost *stillness* (*至静*) to receive the ceaseless movements of life—\nthus achieving simplicity yet effectiveness.\nThey never resort to issuing simple orders and enforcing them strictly,\nnor take petty matters as brilliance.\n\nIndeed, issuing simple orders and enforcing them strictly\nexhausts the spirit in trivial affairs,\nand wearies the mind in insignificant matters.\nTo take petty matters as brilliance,\nhow can this suffice to benefit the world?\n\nThus, the *Dao* of governance values *clarity and stillness* (*清静*), letting the people regulate themselves.\nWhen the people are *confused and restless* (*缺缺*),\n\n*Huizong* annotation says:\n\"To elevate the worthy brings strife among the people (*举贤则民相轧*),\nto entrust the clever leads to theft among the people (*任知则民相盗*),\nthus there is no *full virtue* (*全德*).\"\n\nThe *Commentary* explains:\n\"The Sage’s governance always ensures the people have no knowledge nor desires.\nTo elevate the worthy, the people will vie and compete (*跨跂而相轧*),\nunable to settle their *fate’s distinctions* (*性命之分*);\nto entrust the clever, the people will covet and plunder (*觊觎而相盗*),\nunable to quiet their *fate’s emotions* (*性命之情*).\n\nThis is the peril of knowledge and desire (*有知有欲之为患*),\nand the reason the people are led astray by external things (*迁於物*).\nWhen led astray by external things,\nit is insufficient to enrich the people,\nthus there is no *full virtue*.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says:\n\"*Full virtue* preserves the body (*德全者形全*),\nand failing to preserve *full virtue*,\nnourishing the body cannot sustain life—\nthis is what is meant by *the body’s

Mechanism (*化机*).\nOnly those who *penetrate* (*达者*) know\nthat *benefit* can generate *harm* (*利足以生害*),\nand *joy* can breed *sorrow* (*乐足以生忧*).\nThus, they can apply *intellect* (*智*) at the outset,\nbefore chaos has taken root (*未奔沈之初*),\nand illuminate the path\namidst the faint and fleeting (*忽眇绵*),\nso that *spontaneity* (*诞先*) may ascend\nto the realm of effortless virtue (*无难之地*).\n\nThe *Mencius* warns of *breathing with caution* (*虑息之戒*), saying:\n\"*Virtue* and *wisdom* shield against *intellect*,\nand their essence lies in *sickness and health*

The divine and the foul, the fragrant and the putrid, arise in perpetual succession—thus, the *strange* and the *right* intergenerate, the *disastrous* and the *good* transform in cycles, all as the natural unfolding of one *qi*.\n\nThe world’s formation has endured long, yet minor confusions invert directions—turning east to west, facing the *Dark Mountain* yet failing to see it; great confusions distort nature—mistaking the nonexistent for the real, abandoning the *Mysterious Pearl* yet never seeking it. The habit of self-interest prevails, blinding them to the *curved* and the *straight*; they fail to grasp the *inverted* and *upright* interplay of calamity and fortune. Moreover, they scrutinize with rigid precision, yet only deepen their bewilderment—unresponsive, unenlightened. How then can the people return to their true essence?\n\nThus, Laozi composed the *Political Confusion* chapter, intending to guide the people back to simplicity and purity, to return to their true nature.\n\nHence, the Sage remains *square* yet does not cleave: Emperor Huizong annotated: *Square* means steadfast in discernment, yet the *Great Square* has no corners—still yet fluid, leaving no trace of rigid distinctions. The *Cushioned Explanation* states: Those bound by *square* forms cling to fixed views, differing from customs; this is the “steadfast in discernment” of which we speak. *Steadfast* here aligns with the *I Ching*’s “interposed” (*jiè*), as in *interposed* between stones. The *Great Square* has no bounds—no south nor north, its vastness dissolving in all directions, sufficient to answer the *unbounded* Way. It is not like those who cling to *square* forms, treating them as mere *vessels*.\n\nThe Sage remains *still* yet does not stagnate: This mirrors the *Great Stillness* above, untouched by fluctuations, like water settled in repose. The master carpenter takes its form as law, leaving no path of rigid distinctions—is this not what Confucius called “first stabilizing, then responding”?\n\nThe Sage remains *honest* yet does not excess: Emperor Huizong annotated: *Honest* yet excessive breeds arrogance; radiant yet blinding invites ruin. The Sage holds *straightness* within yet bends without, wielding light yet returning to clarity—only the Sage can do so.\n\nThe people’s confusion lies in treating *square* as *right*—like the *Child Mo* who clings to the center, or the *Middle Son* who holds to rigid virtue. They know extension yet not contraction, prominence yet not subtlety, and thus lose the Sage’s *Great Harmony*, boasting of superficial customs while neglecting the whole. How can they rectify the world?\n\nWhat then is the Sage’s method to rectify the world? Simply this.\n\nThe Sage remains *clean* yet does not exclude: Emperor Huizong annotated: *Clean* yet excluding leads to harshness; the *Great Honest* is unobstructed, pure yet receptive, without rigid judgment. The *Cushioned Explanation* states: Those who guard their *cleanliness* with caution often pride themselves in self-purification—this is the “pride in self-purification” of which we speak. *Pride* here aligns with the *Analects*’ “the ancient *pride*” in *clean* conduct. The *Great Honest* is unobstructed, fully content without further demands, serene in self-sufficiency, rejecting the laborious and difficult. It is not like those who cling to *clean* yet fail to trust—rather, it is like the *Analects*’ “victorious yet unharmed.”\n\nThe Sage remains *bright* yet does not dazzle.»",

      "translated_text": "「The *Cushioned Explanation* states: If one is rigid in self-righteousness and calls it *straightforwardness*, then *straightforwardness* will inevitably indulge one’s emotions, giving rise to the arrogance of trampling others. Only by abandoning the burdens of extreme rectitude and avoiding the faults of crookedness and strain can one achieve *straightforwardness* without indulgence. When applied to things, it moves flexibly and adaptably, never clashing with the world, and thus the arrogance of trampling others does not arise.\n\nIf one takes delight in pleasing the crowd and calls it *brightness*, then *brightness* will inevitably dazzle with outward display, inviting the calamity of boasting. Only by discarding the superficial brilliance of contrived appearances and the ostentatious glare of insincere flattery can one attain *brightness* without dazzle. When its radiance is used to illuminate action, it follows the times and conforms to things, never forcing the heart’s accord, and thus the calamity of boasting does not arise. This is how one remains *straightforward* inwardly yet *flexible* outwardly, wielding its *brightness* while restoring its *clarity*—this is the unique way of the Sage.\n\nIndeed, inward *straightforwardness* is what aligns one with the *Dao* of Heaven. Outward *flexibility* is what harmonizes one with humanity. Only the fully *flexible* and *crooked* can achieve *straightness*—this is the Sage’s virtue. Wielding its *brightness* reveals all *Ren* (benevolence). Restoring its *clarity* conceals the subtleties of application. Only those who follow the manifest yet grasp the hidden, and who discern the pivotal yet remain in the mysterious, can achieve this.\n\nFor the Sage alone can harmonize with Heaven, humanity, and the divine *clarity*. Their virtue cannot be matched by others. As for the people’s confusion, it has long been so. Those who cling to *rigid* principles as truth, like **Zǐ Mò** (子莫) who grasped the *Middle*, cannot adapt with expedience and thus discard the hundred for the one. Those who prize *upright* conduct as truth, like **Zhòngzǐ** (仲子) who upheld *purity*, cannot fulfill its broader scope and thus stain themselves while disrupting harmony. To yield is *crookedness*; to advance is *extension*. Knowing *extension* yet not *crookedness*, one is fixed in rigidity and cannot harmonize with the natural flow—how then can one know *crookedness* and *extension* in mutual accord, as in the *Book of Changes*’ “beneficial for use, secure in abiding”?\n\nThe *hidden* is the *profound*; the *manifest* is the *displayed*. Knowing only the *displayed* yet not the *profound*, one is trapped in superficiality and cannot inherit its *clarity*—how then can one know the *profound* and the *displayed*, as in the *Book of Changes*’ “discerning the few, this is the divine”?\n\n**Zǐ Mò**’s grasp of the *Middle*, **Zhòngzǐ**’s rigid *purity*, knowing only *extension* yet not *crookedness*, knowing only the *displayed* yet not the *profound*—all these are blinded by private bias, narrow and incomplete. They strain their intentions and boast of their conduct to flaunt the flaws of the age, losing the Sage’s full completeness. They do not see the pure and complete essence of Heaven, Earth, and the ancient worthies—how can they rectify the world?\n\nThis is the failure to rectify oneself while presuming to rectify others—clearly, they do not comprehend what is possible. The Sage’s way of rectifying the world is simply this: *rigid* yet not divisive, *upright* yet not rigidly harsh, *straightforward* yet not indulgent, *bright* yet not dazzling.\n\nThe Sage embodies the complete beauty of the *Dao*, holding fast to the *One* as the model for the world. By extending this, rectifying the world’s true essence becomes a mere formality. This is how **Great Shun** could rectify all beings, achieving governance through *non-action*.\n\n**Chapter 59: Rectifying Humanity and Serving Heaven**\n\nRectifying humanity and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses *frugality*.\n\nEmperor Huizong annotated: *Hearing* (聪明) and *intelligence* (智识) are Heaven’s gifts. *Action* (动) and *rest** (静), *thought* (思), and *deliberation* (虑) are human affairs. Adjusting the measures of *action* and *rest*, moderating the burdens of *thought* and *deliberation*—this is how one rectifies humanity. Not exhausting the power of *hearing* nor fully depleting the capacity of *intelligence*—this is how one serves Heaven. This is called *frugality*.\n\nThe *One* of Heaven resides in the *zàng* organs (脏), with the *kidneys* (肾) as its domain. Established in the *unyielding field* (不贷之圃), when *intelligence* is abundant and *frugality* flows, humanity is rectified and Heaven’s *principle* is attained.\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: To know what Heaven does and what humanity does—this is the ultimate. Thus, in attaining the natural, there is no action not of Heaven; in observing expedience, there is no action not of humanity. *Hearing* and *intelligence* arise from the natural and are perfected by Heaven, hence **Han Fei** said: *Hearing* and *intelligence* are Heaven’s gifts. *Action* and *rest*, *thought* and *deliberation*, emerge from expedience and are rooted in humanity, hence **Han Fei** said: *Action* and *rest*, *thought* and *deliberation* are human affairs. To rectify humanity and serve Heaven, one must first prioritize *frugality*—for *action* and *rest* have their constants, the true *principle*. What one thinks and deliberates is the ultimate *Dao*. Adjusting the measures of *action* and *rest* ensures that *action* occurs only at its proper time. Moderating the burdens of *thought* and *deliberation* leads to a tranquil, ever-serene state. Observing expedience in human affairs—this is *frugality* in its essence.\n\nTo abandon *hearing* is to align with the *Great Harmony* (大通). To discard *intelligence* is to follow Heaven’s *principle*. Not exhausting the power of *hearing* allows one to *withdraw sight* and *return hearing* (收视反听). Not fully depleting the capacity of *intelligence* enables one to *revert to simplicity* and *return to purity* (还淳复朴). Attaining the natural in Heaven’s affairs—this too is *frugality*.\n\nIndeed, the *One* of Heaven generates *water* (水), which in humanity is *essence* (精). The *kidneys* are the *zàng* organ that houses *essence*. The *One* of Heaven resides in the *zàng*, its origin rooted in the *unyielding field*—hence the *kidneys* are its domain. Yet it does not depart from *essence*, for this is the way of the *Divine Person* (神人). Thus, in rectifying humanity and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses *frugality*.\n\nEstablished in the *unyielding field*, one fears only excess. When *intelligence* is abundant and *frugality* flows, it does not waste itself in virtue. By this means, humanity is rectified and Heaven’s *principle* is attained. Only through *frugality* does one achieve early restoration.\n\nEmperor Huizong annotated: Restoration comes late when one awakens from confusion. If one seeks restoration before confusion sets in, *frugality* does not waste itself in human nature—thus, restoration comes early.\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: To attain one’s *nature* (性) is to perpetuate life endlessly; to lose one’s *nature* is to fail in perpetuation and reach exhaustion. To return to one’s original *nature* and restore its essence, one must value swift restoration. Restoration after confusion is far removed from the original *nature*—this is the people’s long-standing confusion, the cause of their late awakening.»",

      "translated_text": "「Observe the thunder within the earth—it is *Fù* (復) in the *Hexagram*, yet the first line of nine states: *\"No regret, supreme auspiciousness.\"* But the top line of six becomes ominous. For the first line’s *Fù* is near, while the top line’s *Fù* comes only after confusion has taken hold.\n\nThe *Hexagram of Fù* (比) likewise: the first line speaks of *\"There is another,\"* auspicious; the sixth line declares *\"Fù without a head,\"* ominous. This is because *Fù* and *Bǐ* (比) prefer to act early.\n\nTo practice *frugality* is to not waste one’s *nature* (性), and when *nature* is yet near its source, restoration comes early. Early restoration is called *accumulating virtue* (重积德).\n\nEmperor Huizong annotated: *Fù* (復) is the root of virtue. When one restores through self-awareness, the Dao within us grows daily and ever renews.\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: Virtue is attainment. Attainment from one’s *nature* is what is meant. To observe *Fù* (復) in the midst of the *common multitude* (芸芸), to *Fù* (復) at the very moment of *adversity* (挠挠), is to never stray from one’s *nature*. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: *Fù* (復), the root of virtue.\n\nIf one can restore to its root, then *nature* is cultivated and virtue is perfected, and wisdom will never fail to illuminate. Thus, the *Book of Changes* again says: *Fù* (復) with self-awareness. Therefore, when one does not waste one’s *nature* and restores early, virtue grows daily and becomes vast.\n\nThe *Classic of Documents* (《书》) says: Virtue is renewed daily, and again renewed daily. *Accumulating virtue* (重积德) means none can overcome it.\n\nEmperor Huizong annotated: To conquer is to prevail. To govern all things and command the myriad movements without any that cannot be overcome—this is virtue alone.\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: When virtue is complete within oneself, one does not seek to conquer others but prevails over all. Thus, within oneself it is abundant, and when bestowed upon others, there is still surplus. In its operation and response, it is boundless and universally applicable, its radiance extending to the four quarters and reaching both above and below. Who can know its limits?\n\nMencius said: Virtue’s teachings overflow abundantly, permeating the four seas. If none can know its limits, one can have a kingdom. Emperor Huizong annotated: When virtue is fully realized and boundless, its application to the world is effortless. How much more so for a single kingdom?\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: The true Dao begins with governing oneself; its excess is applied to the state, and its fullness extends to the world. When virtue reaches the stage of *Fù* (復) in its original state, it is boundless and pure. This is what Zhuangzi called *exhausting the whole to achieve unity* (周尽一体). Though the world is vast, it lies within one’s grasp, so its application to the world is effortless. How much more so for a small kingdom?\n\nThe mother of having a kingdom can endure forever. Emperor Huizong annotated: The Dao is the mother of all things, and those who possess the Dao will never falter throughout the ages.\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: The world has a beginning, and this beginning is the mother of the world. Thus, the Dao is the mother of all things. From formed existence to formlessness, from having a mind to being mindless, all arise from it. Hence, it is called the mother.\n\nThe mother of having a kingdom is the possession of the Dao. Those who attain the Dao transcend time, enduring forever without flaw—what is this if not longevity and eternal vision?\n\nEmperor Huizong annotated: The Dao is the mother of all things, and all things are its offspring. *Nature* (性) is the root of form, and form is its foundation. Knowing its offspring and guarding its mother, one will not perish in life. Thus, one can endure forever. A deep root secures its foundation; restoring *nature* preserves form. Aligned with Heaven and Earth, one attains eternal life. Sharing light with the sun and moon, one attains eternal vision. When all things transform while I alone remain, this is called the Dao.\n\nThe *Cushioned Explanation* states: There are beings, and there are beings that give rise to all things. The former are things; the latter is the Dao. The text says: *\"The named is the mother of all things.\"* Zhuangzi said: *\"All things flourish and grow from non-action.\"* Thus, the Dao is the mother of all things, and all things are its offspring.\n\nThere are forms, and there are forms that give rise to forms. Forms are the physical; forms that give rise to forms are *nature* (性). Zhuangzi said: *\"Nature is the essence of life.\"* Liuzi said: *\"Form is the vessel of life.\"* Thus, *nature* is the root of form, and form is its foundation.\n\nThe mother of having a kingdom is the one who knows its offspring and guards its mother. Guarding its mother means uniting with the Dao, enduring through all ages and remaining constant.

      "translated_text": "「Huizong’s annotation states: When dealing with the multitude and often disturbing them, success will be rare. When storing great treasures and frequently moving them, many will be damaged. When cooking a small fish and constantly stirring it, it will be ruined. When ruling a great state and frequently altering its laws, confusion will arise. Therefore, the Dao of governance values clarity and stillness, and the people will naturally settle.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: If a ruler favors strictness, all affairs will be meticulous; if he favors meticulousness, all affairs will become chaotic. Hence, the ruler’s Dao lies in governing with singular focus—if he knows how to govern one thing properly, then all other matters will follow in order. Thus, it is natural that dealing with the multitude and often disturbing them yields little success, and storing great treasures while frequently moving them leads to many damages.\n\nIndeed, the world has its fixed ways: to follow them brings order, to disrupt them brings worry. Only by not disrupting Heaven’s natural course and not opposing the inclinations of things can one establish laws that are firm and unchanging, avoiding the flaw of issuing morning decrees and evening reversals. Then, the world will be well-governed. Just as with cooking fish—if one constantly stirs it, it will spoil—so too, ruling a great state by frequently altering its laws will surely bring confusion.\n\n*The Classic of Transmission* says: If the people trust in their laws, they will be obedient. This is the virtue of ancient sages in lawmaking: their decrees were steadfast as metal and stone, reliable as the four seasons, and never changed.\n\nTherefore, by remaining unadulterated and clear, embracing the Way with tranquility, the people will have no need for governance and will settle naturally. Hence, the Dao of governance values clarity and stillness, and the people will naturally settle. Who would willingly multiply laws and edicts to burden the masses?\n\nThose who govern the world with the Way, their spirits are not malevolent. Huizong’s annotation states: The sage is the Way’s sovereign over all people and things. When compelled to govern the world, the best course is *wuwei* (non-action). The Way is ever in non-action, yet through non-action, all things are governed. Those who rely on others to act will also find stability and rest, none rising to cause misfortune, hence it is said that their spirits are not malevolent.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: The *Book of Poetry* says, *\"A hundred spirits obey you.\"* The *Book of Documents* says, *\"Only the primordial sovereign acts as parent and mother to the people.\"* Zhuangzi says, *\"The sage is the pivot upon which all things hinge.\"* Thus, the sage is indeed the Way’s sovereign over all people and things. Yet, it is easy for me to forget the world, but difficult for the world to forget me. The reason the sage emerges to guide the world is but a dwelling in necessity, a temporary abode.\n\nWhen compelled to govern the world, what else is there to do but maintain reverence and uprightness? Then, through non-action alone, the people’s lives will be at peace, and they will transform naturally. Thus, none will remain ungoverned. Those who rely on others to act and yet claim to be the Way’s sovereign will find their own support and ease, all settling into stability and rest, none rising to cause misfortune—like the *Book of Poetry* says, *\"The ancestral spirits come to rest, their fragrance lingering.\"* Hence, it is said that their spirits are not malevolent.\n\nIt is not that their spirits are not malevolent, but that the Way’s spirit does not harm the people. It is not that the Way’s spirit does not harm the people, but that the sage also does not harm the people. When the two do not harm each other, their virtue reciprocally returns.\n\nHuizong’s annotation states: Those who govern the world with the Way do nothing yet everything is naturally so—there are no wars of aggression, no punishments of slaughter. This is what is meant by \"not harming the people.\"\n\nIn such times, the Way’s spirit and the people’s spirit do not harm each other, and virtue reciprocally returns. The Way’s spirit has no need to manifest its divine influence, but only bestows abundant blessings, hence it is said that the Way’s spirit does not harm the people. The people need not exert their cleverness, for their daily lives are but sustenance and nourishment—how could there be any harm?\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains: The Way is ever in non-action yet accomplishes all. If one governs the world with the Way, one follows its inherent nature without imposing artificial disruptions—this is what is meant by *\"doing nothing yet everything is naturally so.\"* Protecting the people as a father, viewing them as a mother, never resorting to arms—thus there is no calamity of war. Punishments are set aside and unused—thus there are no executions. The Way’s spirit and the people’s spirit do not harm each other, and the bright are without human censure, the hidden without ghostly blame. Then virtue reciprocally returns, for the Way’s spirit has no need to manifest its divine influence, but only bestows abundant blessings, as the *Book of Poetry* says, *\"The Way’s spirit descends in sorrow.\"* The people need not exert their cleverness, for their daily lives are but sustenance and nourishment—like the *Book of Poetry* says, *\"The people are simple.\"* How could there be any harm?\n\nChapter Sixty-One of *The Classic of Transmission*:\nGreat states are the lower reaches of the rivers...」",

The *Cunyi* commentary explains: *\"A nine-tiered tower begins with piled earth; to ascend high, one must start from below. Knowing that the high depends on the low as its foundation, one avoids stumbling by not elevating without a base.\"* Merely desiring the high while neglecting the low is to love the high without attaining it—how could one not stumble?\n\nWater does not accumulate without forming depths; rivers and seas become great by receiving all streams. Thus, they reign over all valleys, and waters pay homage to them because they excel in yielding. Then, is it not the case that a state’s greatness lies in its yielding, and its governance follows accordingly?\n\nThe meeting place of all under Heaven, the feminine of all under Heaven—\nthe feminine always overcomes the masculine through stillness,\nand stillness is the way of yielding.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"While all others rely on strength to contend, I alone dwell in the realm of gentle stillness and non-contention—who then can overcome me?\"* This is the Dao of harmonizing with all under Heaven. The *Classic* says: *\"Knowing the masculine, one holds to the feminine, thus becoming the valley of all under Heaven.\"*\n\nThe *Cunyi* commentary explains: *\"From the perspective of things, only the low can support, only the yielding can prevail. This is the inherent principle: those who rely on fierceness and exploit others, thinking to rise above, merely court ruin. The constant way of victory lies in yielding; the constant way of defeat lies in rigidity.\"*\n\nAll under Heaven rely on strength to contend, yet the Sage adopts weakness, humility, and yielding as his standard. Dwelling in stillness and non-contention, he retreats only to lead, withdraws only to endure. Though he does not seek to overcome others, none can overcome him—this is the Dao of harmonizing with all under Heaven. The *Classic* says: *\"Knowing the masculine, one holds to the feminine, thus becoming the valley of all under Heaven.\"* Indeed, knowing the way to overcome, yet dwelling in yielding stillness, all things must yield to it—because of its stillness.\n\nThus, when great states yield to small states, they take the small states;\nwhen small states yield to great states, they take the great states.\nHence, sometimes one yields to take, sometimes one yields and takes.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"To gather, one must first disperse; to take, one must first give.\"*\n\nThe *Cunyi* commentary explains: *\"There is contraction and expansion, fullness and emptiness—this is not only human affairs but the natural order of Heaven. Only those who perceive these subtle shifts beforehand know that to gather, one must first disperse, understanding that contraction and expansion mutually consume each other; to take, one must first give, knowing that fullness and emptiness follow as beginning and end.\"*\n\nThus, great states yield to small states with the affairs of greatness, and small states yield to great states with the affairs of smallness—each attains what it desires. Then, to rise above others, one must speak of yielding, yet the gentleman does not wish to rise above many—precisely for this reason.\n\nGreat states seek only to nurture others, small states seek only to serve others—both attain what they desire, hence the great should yield.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The Dao of Heaven is yielding yet illuminates all; thus it treads without failing. The Dao of Earth is low yet ascends; thus it sustains Heaven.\"* Human affairs follow Earth, Earth follows Heaven—hence the great should yield.\n\nThe *Cunyi* commentary explains: *\"The Dao of Heaven yields yet nourishes all, its light covering without bound.

      "translated_text": "**The Scholar Jiang Cheng’s Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* – Chapter Sixty-Two: *The Dao as the Hidden Essence of All Things***\n\nThe Dao is the hidden essence of all things.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation:\nThe hidden essence of Heaven lies in the west-north, where the vital essence condenses.\nThe hidden essence of Earth lies in the Yellow Springs, where the spirit-forms conceal themselves.\nThe hidden essence of humanity lies in thought and deliberation, where the supreme spirit is nurtured.\n\nHeaven, Earth, and humanity each possess their hidden essences, yet all are encompassed by the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom, difficult to measure, and difficult to recognize—thus it is the hidden essence of all things.\n\nIf the Dao is the hidden essence of all things, then are not all things the manifest expression of the Dao?\n\n*The Commentary* states:\nThe Dao’s hidden nature is unfathomably deep—like the innermost chamber of a hall, sealed in profound secrecy, or like the depths of the Qi River, concealed and locked away. All that is perverse and manifest yet enters into concealment possesses its hidden essence. In the *Taiyuan* [section], the Three Models are discussed precisely to speak of their hidden depths.\n\nHeaven’s hidden essence lies in the unseen—its west-north corresponds to the *Kan* hexagram, returning to the utmost stillness, where the vital essence condenses. When the vital essence condenses, the movement of *qi* becomes subtle and concealed; when the sun meets the moon, it is obscured—thus it is said: *The hidden essence of Heaven lies in the west-north, where the vital essence condenses.*\n\nEarth’s hidden essence lies in the formless—its Yellow Springs are unfathomably deep, plunged into the utmost darkness, where the spirit-forms conceal themselves. When the spirit-forms conceal themselves, the *yang* energy germinates in secret, hiding its form—thus it is said: *The hidden essence of Earth lies in the Yellow Springs, where the spirit-forms conceal themselves.*\n\nHumanity’s hidden essence lies in the heart and abdomen—thought and deliberation reside within humanity, bending and rising to embrace the four seas, drifting yet weaving through all directions, where the supreme spirit is nurtured. When the supreme spirit is nurtured, it becomes wondrous and boundless, beyond measure—thus it is said: *The hidden essence of humanity lies in thought and deliberation, where the supreme spirit is nurtured.*\n\nThe Three Powers occupy distinct positions, yet each has its hidden essence. Though Heaven possesses its hidden essence, the Dao gives rise to Heaven; though Earth possesses its hidden essence, the Dao gives rise to Earth; though humanity possesses its hidden essence, humanity abides within the Dao. Thus all are encompassed by the Dao—because the Dao cannot be sought through form or number.\n\nThe Three Powers have not yet departed from form and number, yet the Dao cannot be sought through form and number. It may be called difficult to exhaust and difficult to fathom, yet it has never been confined; difficult to measure and difficult to recognize, yet its mysteries cannot be glimpsed.\n\nThe virtuous lend and yet fulfill—its transformation is subtle and profound. The Great Dao is formless, giving birth to Heaven and Earth; the Great Dao is nameless, nourishing all things—thus it is the hidden essence of all things.\n\nIf the Dao is the hidden essence of all things, then from the nonexistent arises the existent, and all things, though manifest, cannot evade it—are they not the manifest expression of the Dao?\n\n**The Treasure of the Virtuous Person**\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation:\nTo practice virtue is to accumulate goodness until nature is perfected, and the divine clarity is naturally attained. The Sage follows this path.\n\n*The Commentary* states:\nThere are those who treasure material things—jewels and jade, as spoken of in the *Transmissions*.\nThere are those who treasure the Dao—such as this statement on the treasure of the virtuous person.\n\nThe virtuous person does not treasure material things; their treasure lies in the Dao. Thus, from humanity they ascend to Heaven, from virtue they reach sainthood, and without entering they attain self-possession.\n\nFor the Dao is the interplay of *yin* and *yang*. What follows it is virtue; what fulfills it is nature. The virtuous person knows that virtue arises from the Dao and is perfected in nature, and thus their unadorned simplicity can be practiced and realized.\n\nWhen practiced, it becomes boundless in its goodness, and in its realization, it never falters. Able to exhaust their nature, they can assist in the transformation and nourishment of all things, aligning with the divine.\n\nFrom the accumulation of desired goodness to the fulfillment of perfect beauty—this is the accumulation of virtue into nature.\nFrom the radiance of great progress to the attainment of the ineffable divine—this is the divine clarity naturally attained.\n\nIf the Sage’s heart follows this path, then they do not stray from the Dao.\n\nWhat treasure can surpass this?\n\n**What the Non-Virtuous Preserve**\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation:\nTo act contrary to the Dao is to invite harm; to follow its principles is to remain whole. To act without restraint is to invite perversity; to still one’s nature is to remain upright—thus one can preserve the body.\n\n*The Commentary* states:\nThe Dao acts without action yet accomplishes all things.\nIf one acts contrary to its all-encompassing nature, there will be no harm.\nIf one acts without restraint, there will be no perversity.\n\nTo act contrary to the Dao without harm—one must abandon cleverness and artifice, follow its principles without deviation, and thus guard their wholeness, so that nothing can harm them.

      "translated_text": "「Reverence, caution, awe, and propriety—these are the norms for the people. When actions are noble and worthy of emulation, they are still sufficient to bestow upon others, and how much more so when one embodies the Dao’s hidden essence?\n\nOnly when one embodies the Dao’s hidden essence does one nurture and manifest the myriad transformations, encompass all wonders, move like the heavens in their operation—covering all without partiality—and hold like the sea in its capacity—containing all without omission. Though they may appear diverse and conflicting, all converge in the singular principle of the Dao. What then is there to distinguish?\n\nThus, what is there to abandon in humanity’s imperfections?\n\n*The Classic of Poetry* says:\n*\"Is this not my great sage?*\n*What is there in others that he does not embrace?\"*\n\nTherefore, only those who embody the Dao’s hidden essence can truly fulfill the universal principle of inclusivity. Hence, establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Exalted Ministers—though they may offer jade discs and four-horse chariots to attract the worthy—is not as effective as simply cultivating this Dao to refine oneself. The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:\n*\"The virtue of a gentleman lies in cultivating his own person to achieve peace in the realm. The Son of Heaven and the Three Exalted Ministers, though they use jade discs and four-horse chariots to summon the worthy and gain their service, fail to prioritize the cultivation of the Dao within themselves. Thus, they forsake themselves for others and lose the path of self-governance. ‘Not as effective as cultivating this Dao’ means seeking virtue within oneself alone. Where the Dao resides, the Sage holds it in reverence, and thus the people follow it as they return to the marketplace.\"*\n\n*The Commentary* states:\n*\"Though the world is vast, governance lies in the Dao; though the four seas are distant, governance lies in the heart. What is the greatest of guardianship? Guardianship of one’s person is greatest. When that which is guarded is most refined, then its application becomes most expansive. The ancients who spoke of governance began with self-discipline, their thoughts reaching far even in proximity. This is achieved through the cultivation of one’s own person. As for governing the realm, it is because the gentleman’s self-cultivation brings peace to the world. Though the Son of Heaven and the Three Exalted Ministers are esteemed for their rank, if they govern the people through the Dao, the realm will naturally submit. Even if they use jade discs and four-horse chariots to attract the worthy and gain their service, making them a glory for the state, yet they do not prioritize the cultivation of the Dao within themselves, they cannot maintain true guardianship. Without true guardianship, they abandon themselves for others and lose the path of self-governance.*\n\n*Yangzi said: ‘First govern oneself, then govern others—that is the mark of a great vessel.’*\n*‘Not as effective as cultivating this Dao’ means prioritizing self-governance.*\n\n*What is called self-governance is not external influence; it is seeking within oneself alone. If one seeks within oneself alone, then the use of others is but an extension of oneself. In ancient times, Emperor Yao achieved clarity and virtue, bringing the common folk to harmony in times of change. King Wen of Zhou was born with sagely wisdom, ascending to the shore of governance and ruling his state with ease. Each attained this through the same means.*\n\n*Though the Dao’s true essence lies in self-cultivation, its subtle extensions govern the state, and its fundamental principles govern the world—yet the key is to understand the Dao. Hence, where the Dao resides, the Sage holds it in reverence, and thus the people follow it as they return to the marketplace. The Sage is the parent of the people. When the Sage holds the Dao in reverence above, the people follow it below. If they grasp the Dao with the tenacity of a dog or the steadfastness of an elephant, will not the world turn toward them? Why was this Dao so esteemed in antiquity? Was it not because one seeks and attains it, and even the guilty are absolved? Hence, it is most precious for the world.*\n\n*The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:*\n*‘To seek is to attain—this seeking is within oneself.’*\n*Ancient people sought the Dao in the principles of yin and yang and the rhythms of fate, yet did not attain it. This was because they sought externally. Can the malevolent be transformed into the virtuous, and the foolish into the wise? This is how the guilty are absolved. The Dao’s benevolent teachings are such, hence its preciousness for the world.*\n\n*The Classic of Changes says:*\n*‘There is nothing in the world that is not esteemed—except the Dao.’*\n*The Commentary states:*\n*‘The heart is the sovereign of the Dao, so the Dao is never separate from me. The Dao cannot be sought through emotions, so it is never obstructed by external things. Since the Dao is never separate from me, one must seek it within oneself to attain true attainment—because seeking lies within me. Since the Dao is never obstructed by external things, one must seek it through the principles of yin and yang and the rhythms of fate. Seeking it for five years without attaining it, seeking it through yin and yang for twelve years without attaining it—this is because seeking lies externally. Seeking within oneself is beneficial for attainment; seeking externally is not. Thus, those who seek but do not attain do so because the Dao is near, yet they seek it far. But the virtuous seek and attain it by seeking within themselves alone. The Dao within oneself contains all beauties; people only suffer from not seeking it. If one truly aligns the heart with the Dao, then the malevolent can be transformed into the virtuous, virtue cultivated unconsciously, and there will be no fault of misconduct. The foolish can become wise, understanding the principles and awakening to them, without the confusion of divergent paths. This is how the guilty are absolved. The Dao’s benevolent salvation of humanity is such, hence it cannot be cheapened—it is most precious for the world. ‘There is nothing in the world that is not esteemed—except the Dao’ means it is not esteemed by external titles, yet its natural reverence is ever-present.*\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three: On Non-Action**\n*To practice non-action (wuwei), to act without clinging to action (shi-wu-shi), to savor without attachment to flavor (wei-wu-wei).*\n\n*The Emperor Huizong’s annotation states:*\n*The Dao’s essence is without fabrication, hence non-action (wuwei); without form, hence without clinging to action (shi-wu-shi); without desire, hence without attachment to flavor (wei-wu-wei). The Sage responds to things as they are, yet embodies the Dao’s essence of non-fabrication in these three aspects.*\n\n*The Commentary states:*\n*The Dao’s subtlety lies in its non-existence; it cannot be sought through physical form. Yet when speaking of its grand completeness, we provisionally call it ‘essence.’ What is called the Dao’s essence is like Zhuangzi’s description of the ancient people’s great framework. Since the Dao’s essence is subtly non-existent, its stillness and motionlessness are non-fabrication (wuzuo). Non-fabrication means non-action (wuwei), and non-action means the utmost action is without fabrication. The formless form is without clinging to form (wuxiang). Without clinging to form means without clinging to action (shi-wu-shi), and without clinging to action means no burden of fabrication or action. The tranquil sufficiency is without desire (wuyu). Without desire means without attachment to flavor (wei-wu-wei), and without attachment to flavor means those who crave flavor have never truly presented themselves.\"*",

The measure of things is boundless, beyond enumeration.\nIf something is great yet not excessive, small yet not deficient, then the distinctions between resentment and gratitude—who can discern them?\n\nThe Sage unifies all things in the One *wu*, thus achieving the utmost greatness.\nThe *Cushui* explains:\nFrom the perspective of things, they appear in diverse forms—whether the void or the great marsh, the minutest hair or a horse’s body—differing in shape and confined by form, varying in number and constrained by quantity.\nFrom the perspective of the Dao, all things are one. Though the Northern Sea is vast, it is unknown whether it is \"great yet not excessive\"; though the Jīng River’s flow is small, it is unknown whether it is \"small yet not deficient.\" Since the measure of things is boundless, it cannot be enumerated.\nThus, resentment may have its distinctions, but gratitude arises from the heart. Though these two may be instruments of rectification, they are not the Dao of rectification itself.\nActing without expectation of return, the Sage harmonizes with all things—how then can distinctions be seen?\n\nThe Sage, through the emptiness of the Dao, receives all the manifold realities of the world, never causing harm to others, never hoarding benevolence and grace. Thus, unifying all things in the One *wu*, gathering all smallness into unity, achieving the utmost greatness—spanning heaven and earth, vast beyond containment.\nTherefore, the Emperor and King take heaven and earth as their ancestral model, and this is the pinnacle of the central realm.\n\n**Repaying resentment with virtue:**\nHuizong’s annotation: Titles and rewards are insufficient as incentives, punishments and shame are insufficient as deterrents—then what resentment remains? What is valued is virtue alone.\nThe *Cushui* explains:\nOne who embodies complete virtue gains the world’s praise yet remains indifferent, unaffected by the rewards of crowns and honors—thus, titles and rewards are insufficient as incentives.\nOne who embodies complete virtue faces the world’s censure yet remains unshaken, fearing neither the executioner’s axe nor the blade—thus, punishments and shame are insufficient as deterrents.\nWhen honor and disgrace arise, they neither benefit nor harm their true nature. Thus, distinctions of right and wrong cannot be divided, and distinctions of greatness and smallness cannot be enumerated. At the utmost division, there is ultimately no division—then what resentment remains?\nOnly one of supreme virtue can achieve this. Thus, what is truly valued is virtue alone.\n\nFor the Yang is virtue, the Yin is resentment. Repaying resentment with virtue means merging into the indistinct, flowing without obstruction—this is called \"responding to resentment without resentment,\" and it is the highest expression of virtue.\n\n**Addressing difficulties in their ease, achieving greatness in the minute:**\nThe world’s difficult matters must begin in ease, the world’s great affairs must begin in the minute.\nHuizong’s annotation:\nA thousand-zhang dike collapses from the burrow of an ant;\nA hundred-foot hall burns from a crack’s smoke.\nWhite Gui’s dike-walking seals the burrows, thus avoiding water’s calamity.\nThe aged man’s fire-watching seals the gaps, thus avoiding fire’s disaster.\nWorldly affairs always originate in the most trivial matters, and by the time they reach their end, they become impossible to counter—thus, the Sage acts early.\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*The Classic* says, \"Do not let it spread,\" for once it spreads, it is difficult to counter—thus, those who plan far ahead do not neglect what is easy.\n*The Scripture* says, \"Do it before it exists,\" for those who know the few must examine what is minute.\nA thousand-zhang dike may be called a river’s defense, yet if the ant’s burrow—though small—is not stopped, the trickle will not be dammed, and it will become a river.\nA hundred-foot hall may be called a secure dwelling, yet if the crack’s smoke—though faint—is not heeded, the flicker will not be extinguished, and the flames will rage—what then?\nWhite Gui’s dike-walking must seal the burrows, thus avoiding water’s calamity.\nThe aged man’s fire-watching must seal the gaps, thus avoiding fire’s disaster.\nYet the enlightened sage acts brilliantly in the fleeting and subtle, applying wisdom before matters become overwhelming. Each time this is observed, it echoes Han Fei’s teachings.\n\nThus, it is seen: the world’s affairs always originate in the most trivial matters.\n*The Odes* say, \"On auspicious days, be cautious of the minute,\" because affairs arise from the most trivial matters.\nBy the time they reach their end, they become impossible to counter.\n*The Changes* say, \"In anticipating calamities, take preventive measures,\" because their end is difficult to counter.\nThe Sage’s wisdom penetrates to the divine, and thus acts early—knowing this alone. This aligns with the Master’s saying, \"Planning ahead in advance is called foresight.\"\n\nThus, the Sage never seeks the great directly, and so achieves the utmost greatness.\nHuizong’s annotation: \"Acting in the small, thus achieving the great.\"\nThe *Cushui* explains:\nWhen the earth is but a clod, it becomes a field;\nWhen water is but a ladleful, it becomes a river.\nThus, acting in the small allows one to achieve the great—this is the natural order.\nThe Sage deliberates in undertaking affairs, ensuring each success, thus bringing about great governance—also by acting in the small.\n\n*The Odes* praise the governance of Wen and Wu, accumulating the *Xiao Ya* to form the *Da Ya*—its beginning was small, its accomplishment great, thus achieving internal and external governance, beginning with diligent concern.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, if one waits until chaos has already taken form before seeking to govern it, is this not too late?\n\nMencius cited *The Odes: Owl* (《鸱鸮》) to say:\n*\"Before the heavens darken with rain, mend the thatched doors and windows of the mulberry grove.*\n*This is to make known the state’s policies and laws when there is still leisure—*\n*seeking to govern before the crisis arises.*\n*How could it compare to waiting for the great cold before seeking warm garments?\"*\n\nThus, the Sage takes this poem as the *Dao/Way* of foresight.\n\nTherefore, the affairs of the world—what seems small can be done, and what seems great cannot be undone once neglected.\n\nHe who makes light of promises will lack trustworthiness; he who undertakes many things lightly will face many difficulties. Hence, the Sage proceeds with caution, and thus ultimately faces no difficulties.\n\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*\"Calamity is often hidden in the subtle, erupting when people overlook it.*\n*The Sage’s response to the world is always to be vigilant in the subtle and never negligent,*\n*so there is never any reckless action,*\n*and thus no insurmountable calamity arises.*\n*This is all in accordance with the principle of *wu* (無)—non-doing, non-action.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*\"Fire arises from wood; if the disaster is inevitable, then calamity is indeed hidden in the subtle.*\n*If one treats it lightly, it is unwise, and thus calamity erupts when people overlook it.*\n*Mencius said that blessings and misfortunes are all self-sought—*\n*this is to say, do not neglect the subtle.*\n\n*The Sage’s response to the world is to share in the people’s afflictions.*\n*His wisdom suffices to comprehend the principles of things,*\n*his foresight suffices to perceive omens early,*\n*and he deliberates before signs appear,*\n*always cautious in the subtle, considering beginnings with the same care as endings,*\n*and never overlooking what others neglect.*\n*Thus, there is never any reckless action,*\n*and thus no insurmountable calamity arises.*\n\n*The Records* say:\n*'Better to have one’s own grudges than to break a promise without cause.'*\n*Without reckless promises, words will align with actions.*\n\n*The Commentaries* say:\n*'If one deems it easy, difficulty will soon follow.'*\n*Without undertaking many things lightly, every action will lead to auspicious outcomes.*\n\n*Thus, navigating the world with this approach—*\n*adapting flexibly and appropriately—*\n*one will ultimately face no difficulties.*\n\n*Yet this is not because one delights in omniscience,*\n*but because one embodies the *wu* of *wuwei*—*\n*non-action, non-taste,*\n*the *Dao/Way* of nothingness.*\n\n*Where the *Dao/Way* resides, who can pose difficulty?*\n*The final stanza of *The Teal and Heron* speaks of no future calamity—*\n*this aligns with the same meaning.*\n\n*Chapter Sixty-Four of *The Ease of Holding Firm*:*\n*'What is firm is easy to hold,*\n*what is yet unmanifest is easy to plan,*\n*what is fragile is easy to dissolve,*\n*what is subtle is easy to disperse.*\n*Act before it exists,*\n*govern before it is disordered.*\n\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*'Firmness is the opposite of danger,*\n*the unmanifest is the opposite of what is already formed,*\n*the fragile is the opposite of hardness,*\n*the subtle is the opposite of what is manifest.*\n*To hold firmness is to avoid danger,*\n*to plan before the unmanifest is to prevent its formation.*\n\n*The Sage’s foresight—*\n*to dissolve fragility before it hardens,*\n*to disperse the subtle before it takes hold—*\n*this is the near-miss of the worthy.*\n\n*Chariots racing on steep paths,*\n*boats navigating treacherous currents—*\n*the Sage has no need for such cleverness.*\n*Cleverness is applied before the race or the sinking,*\n*this is what is meant by*\n*'acting before it exists,*\n*governing before it is disordered.'*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*'Matters hidden in non-existence all follow natural principles;*\n*once they manifest, they all follow inevitable mechanisms.*\n*The principles are deeply hidden—*\n*only the most divine can penetrate them;*\n*the mechanisms are subtly triggered—*\n*only the most wise can foresee them.*\n\n*'Firmness is the opposite of danger—*\n*where there is firmness, there must be danger.*\n*The unmanifest is the opposite of what is formed—*\n*if unmanifest, its form will vanish,*\n*this is the principle of non-existence.*\n*The fragile is the opposite of hardness—*\n*hardness has already taken its substance.*\n*The subtle is the opposite of what is manifest—*\n*manifestation has already revealed its beginning,*\n*this is the reality of existence.*\n\n*'To hold firmness is to avoid danger,*\n*thus one can preserve the state.*\n*To plan before the unmanifest is to prevent calamity.*\n\n*The Sage’s foresight—*\n*is it not divine?*\n*Knowing the subtle and the manifest,*\n*acting clearly in the fleeting and obscure,*\n*divine insight into the future.*\n\n*To dissolve fragility before it hardens—*\n*this is why one must be cautious at the first frost.*\n*To disperse the subtle before it takes hold—*\n*this is why one must examine the minutest details.*\n\n*The worthy’s near-miss—*\n*their wisdom, though not divine,*\n*is close to perfection when reflecting,*\n*and does not stray when erring,*\n*discerning early what the wise later grasp.*\n\n*Indeed, omens are the subtle movements,*\n*the precursors of auspiciousness.*\n*Seeing the second line of *Yù* (《豫》):*\n*'In accordance with principle, one awakens—*\n*this is the Sage’s foresight.'*\n\n*The first line of *Fù* (《复》):*\n*'Form takes shape, then one awakens—*\n*this is the worthy’s near-miss.'*\n\n*Only because they know omens*\n*do they not ultimately say, 'This is auspicious.'*\n*Only because they nearly miss*\n*do they have no regret,*\n*and thus how could there be calamities of racing chariots or sinking boats?*\n\n*Indeed, chariots are for ascending steep paths,*\n*boats are for crossing difficulties—*\n*racing chariots, sinking boats,*\n*the Sage has no need for such cleverness.*\n\n*Yang Xiong, in response to a question,*\n*spoke of applying cleverness before the race or sinking.*\n\n*Thus, to act before it exists,*\n*to govern before it is disordered—*\n*this brings ultimate safety,*\n*surpassing even the most perilous paths or the need for oars.*\n\n*A tree of embrace grows from the minutest sprout;*\n*a nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;*\n*a thousand-*li journey begins beneath one’s feet.*\n\nHuizong’s annotation:\n*'All formed things—*\n*the great must grow from the small,*\n*the high must be founded on the low,*\n*the distant must begin near.*\n*What is simple in its beginning*\n*will inevitably become vast in its completion.*\n\n*The Sage, seeing the beginning, contemplates the end,*\n*observing the finger, knows the path.*\n*Thus, he does not become the first to invite blessings,*\n*nor the first to invite calamity.*\n*He deliberates before undertaking affairs,*\n*ensuring each success.'*\n\nThe *Cushui* explains:\n*'What is formed arises from what is formless;*\n*all that is constrained by form*\n*must progress from the subtle to the manifest—*\n*thus, the great must grow from the small.*\n\n*To seek the axe’s handle,*\n*one must begin with the uncut millimeter;*\n*that a tree of embrace grows from the minutest sprout is evident.\"*",

else.\n\nTo exchange oneself for things is to lose oneself in them—\nalready galloping with the restless, one does not know\nthat stillness lies in motion itself.\n\nTo drown oneself in knowledge is to make the heart\nbranched and doubtful—\nalready obstructed by the concrete, one does not know\nthat diminishing the concrete brings *xu* [emptiness].\n\nThus, it is not sufficient to attain *wuwei*.\n\nThe Sage does not act so.\n\nHe does not burden his form with profit,\nfor his seeking lies within—\nwhat he desires is internal, not external,\nand desire arises from *not* desiring.\n\nTo share profit brings delight,\nto share sustenance brings ease—\nnot clinging to the gains of one age as private possession,\nbut ensuring all under heaven are nourished,\nwhich aligns with Zhuangzi’s words:\n*\"nurturing self and others equally,\nstopping only when fully nourished.\"*\n\nThus, he does not value hard-to-obtain treasures,\nnor let others extinguish the Way—\nhe simply abandons human contrivance.\n\nWhat he learns lies in the heart,\nnot in external pursuit,\nand learning is in *not* learning.\n\nFollowing nature’s inherent course,\npracticing until mastery,\nhe does not augment true virtue with fragmented schemes,\nbut aims for morning clarity to behold the singular—\nthis is what the *Shijing* [Book of Songs] calls\n*\"learning lies in weaving and brightening the light\"*—\nthus restoring what others have overstepped.\n\nFor those who exhaust skill and seek rare treasures,\nthese are the hard-to-obtain things.\nThe Sage does not value them,\nfor he wishes the people not to stray after things—\nthus can it be said:\n*\"I have no desires, yet the people find sufficiency.\"*\n\nTo abandon the root and chase the superficial\nis the error of the common folk.\nThe Sage restores their errors,\nnot to punish them but to return them to the Way—\nthus can it be said:\n*\"He is always good at saving people,\nyet never abandons them.\"*\n\nFor the Way, when obscured,\neven the worthy err—\nthe wise among the worthy still have their *guo* [oversteps],\nhow much more the common folk?\n\nTo restore their errors and return them to nature\nis how the heart is cultivated and virtue is restored,\nvirtue reaches perfection and aligns with its original state,\napproaching the vision of the Dao and transcending learning—\nabiding in nature’s inherent course,\nwithout fixed purpose yet ever joyful,\nthis is how the absolute learner knows no worry.\n\nIf the son of Yan [Preyan] discards *renyi* [benevolence and righteousness], *gongyue* [rites and music],\nyet finds joy in his *danpiao* [coarse meal and gourd], *zhuoru* [wild plants and coarse rice],\nis this not akin to the Sage’s joy in forgetting worries?\n\nTo aid the natural unfolding of all things,\nyet not dare to act.\n\n*The Commentary* of Xuanzong [Huang] says:\n*\"Heaven is high, earth is low,\nall things are dispersed and distinct—\nhow could one force them?\nTheir growth and change are nature’s own.\nTo aid their natural unfolding,\nis how their nature is perfected.\nTo act is to ruin them—\nthus the Sage does not dare to act.\nThis is how the Sage relies on Dao/Way’s transformation,\nnot on clever schemes.\"*\n\n*The Commentary* says:\n*\"Heaven moves above,\nnot creating yet transforming,\nearth rests below,\nnot growing yet nurturing—\nall things flourish between heaven and earth,\nlike motion or stillness,\nsprouting in varied forms—\nthis is what is meant by\n*‘Heaven is high, earth is low,\nall things are dispersed and distinct.’*\n\nThe Sage praises heaven and earth’s transformation and nurturing,\nand all things that follow their Way—\nhow could one force them?\nTheir birth, growth, and change in form and color,\ntheir intelligence and capabilities waxing or waning—\nthese are nature’s own.\nTo aid their natural unfolding,\nis not to promote their growth,\nnor to urge their completion,\nbut to let them be as they are,\nentrusting them to their own course—\nthus their nature is perfected.\n\nYet heaven acts without action and remains clear,\nearth acts without action and remains tranquil,\nall things follow their roles—\neach thrives from *wuwei* [non-action],\nso what aids their nature\nis not by human force or cleverness?\n\nTo act is to ruin them,\nand even worse, to invite the loss of *zhong* [augmentation].\nThus the Sage does not dare to act.\nThis is how the Sage relies on Dao/Way’s transformation,\nnot on clever schemes.\n\nRelying on Dao/Way’s transformation,\nhe follows things’ natural course without private favor—\nnot clinging to cleverness,\nhe discards knowledge and habit,\nconforming to heaven’s principles—\nthus, without action, all things transform.\n\nAs for those who carve *zhu* [bamboo or wood],\nthree years to make one leaf—\nthen few are the things with leaves,\nhow can they speak of Dao/Way’s transformation?\n\n**Chapter 65: Ancient Masters of the Dao**\nThe ancient masters who excelled in the Dao\ndid not seek to enlighten the people—\nthey sought only to bewilder them.\n\n*The Commentary* of Xuanzong [Huang] says:\n*\"The people can be led by the Way,\nbut cannot be made to know it—\nthe ancient masters of the Dao\nled them by the Way alone.\nTo reverse their natural state,\nthe Way can be carried and followed together—\nno need for clever

      "translated_text": "Zhuang Zhou, by examining the principles of things to verify human affairs, understands that all things arise from the **Dao/Way**, yet cannot be disturbed by cleverness. Thus, he says that when the world often falls into great disorder, the fault lies in their love of knowledge.\n\nThe **sage’s governance** always keeps the people without knowledge or desire, allowing the **Dao/Way’s** empty tranquility to emerge as the natural response for all under heaven—what need is there for cleverness to suffice?\n\nTherefore, those who speak well of governance say:\nIn discussing the foundation of **Great Peace (太平)**, they declare that **schemes and stratagems are not employed (智谋不用)**.\nIn speaking of the marvelous transformation of the **Dao/Way (道化)**, they say that it does not rely on **cleverness and skill (不恃智巧)**.\nIs this not to say that the essentials of governance lie in **knowing the Dao/Way (知道)** rather than in loving cleverness?\n\nHence, **governing with cleverness** is the ruin of the state.\nEmperor Xuanzong annotated:\n*\"When laws are promulgated, deceit flourishes; when decrees are issued, fraud arises.\"*\n\nThe **Cushui commentary** explains:\nZhuangzi says: **\"The wise are instruments of contention (争之器).\"**\nIf cleverness arises from contention, then the people will pursue profit and become **artful in schemes (机巧)**.\nWhat is meant by **\"laws are promulgated\"** is that without laws, there is nothing adequate to bind them.\nIf severe prohibitions are established by law, yet there are still those who **defy and transgress (抵冒)**, then the hearts of deceit and malice cannot be unified.\nWhat is meant by **\"decrees are issued\"** is that without decrees, there is nothing adequate to command them.\nWhen decrees are issued, only obedience follows—yet if there are still those who **pretend compliance (面革)**, then the emotions of deceit and falsehood cannot be stopped.\nThe **Classics** say: *\"The more laws and decrees are multiplied, the more thieves and robbers will appear.\"*\nThus, deceit and fraud are evident—**governing with cleverness** is the ruin of the state.\n**Not governing with cleverness** is the blessing of the state.\nEmperor Xuanzong annotated:\n*\"Burn the symbols and shatter the seals, and the people will be simple and unsophisticated.\nAbandon the measures and break the balances, and the people will not contend.\"*\n\nThe **Cushui commentary** explains:\nZhuangzi says: **\"The Dao/Way is the public standard (为之公).\"**\nIf the **Dao/Way** is made the public standard, then the people will naturally **trust without constraint (不约而自孚)**.\nWhat is meant by **\"burn the symbols and shatter the seals\"** is not that they are literally burned and broken—rather, by **establishing trust (信信)**, the people become simple and unsophisticated, and symbols and seals are no longer relied upon.\nWhat is meant by **\"abandon the measures and break the balances\"** is not that they are literally discarded and snapped—rather, by **acting with fairness (平平)**, the people do not contend, and measures and balances are of no use.\nThe **Classics** say: *\"If I love tranquility, the people will naturally be upright.\nIf I have no desires, the people will naturally be content.\"*\nWhen the people are upright and content, their simplicity and lack of contention are clear—**not governing with cleverness** is the blessing of the state.\nUnderstanding these two principles is the **model (楷式)**.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong annotated:\n*\"Understanding these two principles means knowing how to govern the state.\nKnowing how to govern the state, the people will follow and emulate them as the model.\"*\n\nThe **Cushui commentary** explains:\n*\"The form is correct, then its reflection is correct;\nThe source is clear, then the stream is clear—\nthis is the natural correspondence (自然之符).\"*\nThe **sage**, standing above the people and things of the world,\n**upright in form and clear in source (端表澄源)**,\ngoverns without action while the world transforms—\nit is only a matter of **employing cleverness or not employing cleverness (用智与不用智)****.\nUnderstanding these two principles means knowing that the responsibility of governance lies in **clarity and tranquility (清静)**, with no need for cleverness.\n\nIf one does not govern with cleverness,\nthen those who listen to the **sage’s voice (听唱)** and observe his **rites and conduct (视仪)**,\nwill derive their **model (效法)** from the **Dao/Way’s** manifestations and responses—\nwho would not follow and emulate them as the model?\n\n**Model (则)** is like the **standard for making a standard (作则之则)**—\nbecause it has a standard, the people follow the standard.\n**Emulation (象)** is like the **pendant for hanging a pendant (垂象之象)**—\nbecause it has an emulation, the people emulate it.\nOnly because there is a model and emulation,\nthe people follow and emulate them as the model.\n\nIf, for instance, Master Guanzhi posed the question:\n*\"Why does water round the basin, yet the basin itself is round?\nWhy does water square the vessel, yet the vessel itself is square?\"*\nHis intent aligns with this.\n\n**Constantly knowing the model (常智楷式)** is called **Mysterious Virtue (玄德)**.\n**Mysterious Virtue** is profound, vast, and contrary to things.\nEmperor Xuanzong annotated:\n*\"Mysterious (玄) is the color of Heaven.\nIf one constantly knows the model without using cleverness,\nthen one unites with Heaven’s virtue—\nprofound beyond measure,\nvast beyond limit,\nstanding alone above all things,\nwith nothing to pair with.\"*\nThus, it is said: **\"contrary to things (与物反).\"**\n\nThe **Cushui commentary** explains:\n*\"The subtle and minute is called Mysterious (玄).\nMysterious is the color of Heaven.\nIf one constantly knows the model without using cleverness,\nthen one takes **Embracing Unity (抱一)** as the model for all under Heaven.\nIf so, then abandoning cleverness and

alone above all things,\nwith nothing to pair with—\nthis is what Master Liezi called **the Doubtful One (疑独)**,\nhence it is said: **‘contrary to things.’**\nUnless one **enters the Dao/Way (入)** and **discerns things (辨物)**,\nwho can unite with Heaven’s virtue?\nThen one reaches **Great Harmony (大顺).\"**\n\nEmperor Xuanzong annotated:\n*\"Harmony (顺) is Heaven’s principle.\nTo reach **Great

cleverness.\n\nThe **Cushui commentary** explains:\nIn the *Yijing*’s **\"Yù (豫)\"** it says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth move with Harmony (顺动),\nso the sun and moon do not pass their bounds,\nand the four

is said: *\"The simple principles of all under Heaven are easily attained (易简天下之理得),\"\nand this is why **Harmony** is Heaven’s principle.*\n\nTo reach **Great Harmony** means\nabandoning the cleverness that makes one **artificial (使然)**,\nand aligning with the **natural principles (自然之至理)**—\nby **not knowing and not recognizing (不识不知)**,\nfollowing the **sage’s model (帝之则)** alone.\nThis is what is meant by:\n*\"Abandoning cleverness and fixed habits,\nfollowing Heaven’s principle.\"*\n\nZhuang Zhou wrote in the *\"Heaven and Earth (天地)\"* chapter,\ndiscussing **nature (性)**,

      "translated_text": "I hold three treasures, treasures to be cherished.\nHuizong’s annotation: Different from the common world’s perception, yet guarded without loss, these are the treasures I hold.\nExegesis: The Sage differs from the virtuous; viewing the Sage through the eyes of the virtuous still reveals distinctions—how much more so with the vulgar’s perspective? Their divergence is profound indeed.\nThe so-called three treasures: In the vulgar world, they are obscured by private views, mistakenly deemed small. Yet when viewed through principle, they are what constitutes the great.\nTo differ from the vulgar’s perception and guard them without loss—then one embraces them well without abandoning them, never for a moment separated. This may truly be called cherishing and holding them.\n\nThe Confucian scholar does not treasure gold and jade but holds loyalty and trust as treasures, thus knowing that my three treasures lie within, not without, and must be held to their utmost.\n\nAlas, the vulgar man treasures his treasures yet fails to treasure their essence, making them burdens upon himself. Hence, those who treasure pearls and jade invite calamity upon themselves.\n\n**First: Benevolence.**\nHuizong’s annotation: Benevolence loves all things; it is the substance of virtue.\nExegesis: Benevolence takes compassion for all as its heart; virtue takes love for humanity as its foundation. Thus, filial piety begins with a father’s benevolence, and feasting demonstrates benevolent kindness. Ultimately, all stem from love—how could benevolence not be the substance of virtue?\nLaozi spoke of Dao and virtue, rejecting virtue yet treasuring this; he did not reject it but sought to clarify virtue’s essence.\n\n**Second: Frugality.**\nHuizong’s annotation: Frugality ensures sufficiency; it is the moderation of ritual.\nExegesis: Frugality is the common virtue; ritual values appropriate use. Thus, frugality without ritual leads to universal scarcity, while frugality with ritual is fitting. Ultimately, all honor sufficiency—how could frugality not be the moderation of ritual?\nConfucius said, *\"Rather be frugal than extravagant\"*—he did not mean miserliness but sought to clarify ritual’s moderation.\n\n**Third: Not daring to lead the world.**\nHuizong’s annotation: To lead is to seek victory over others, to value strength over virtue.\nExegesis: There is a constant way of victory called softness, and a constant way of defeat called rigidity.\nSoftness does not seek victory over others; it manifests as yielding, weakness, and humility, yet none can contend with it.\nRigidity seeks victory over others; though it strives to excel, how can it always excel?\nIf one can be rigid yet not soft, leading to seek victory over others, then one values strength over virtue.\nStrength is the beginning of contention; valuing strength means favoring bravery, and things will oppose it—like Zhuangzi’s *\"using cleverness to contend with strength.\"*\nHumility is the handle of virtue; valuing virtue means softness and compliance, and none can demean it—like the *Yijing*’s *\"Heaven, Earth, humanity, and spirits all take from humility.\"*\nThen, those who seek victory over others value strength over virtue—how can they compare to those who do not seek victory, valuing virtue over strength?\nTo not value strength is to know not to dare lead the world, to humble oneself and advance in virtue. Thus, restrained in bearing, it becomes the corner of virtue.\n\nBenevolence, therefore, brings courage.\nHuizong’s annotation: King Wen viewed the people as wounded; his anger settled the world’s people.\nExegesis: The virtuous must be courageous; thus, those who love others abhor harm to them.\nThe virtuous must have authority; thus, constant virtue suffices to establish martial affairs.\nKing Wen cherished the common people, benefiting widows and orphans. Mencius called his care for the people like tending to wounds—truly benevolent.\nWhen his wrath flared, he disciplined his troops and achieved martial triumphs, conquering the exalted. His anger settled the world’s people—his courage was unmatched.\nThus, benevolence brings courage; this is evident.\n\nFrugality, therefore, brings breadth.\nHuizong’s annotation: Store in winter, and abundance will flourish in spring.\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot always indulge in excess; how much more so for humanity?\nExegesis: The *Yijing* says: *\"Kān is concealment and withdrawal.\"*\nKān corresponds to the north in direction and winter in season, where all things retreat—thus, concealment is spoken of in winter.\nIt also says: *\"Zhèn is flourishing and abundance.\"*\nZhèn corresponds to the east in direction and spring in season, where all things emerge—thus, abundance is spoken of in spring.\nOnly by concealing in winter does abundance come in spring. The movement of qi and the principles of all things have their own times of waxing and waning, their own measures of fullness and contraction. Heaven and Earth provide for all without ever indulging, transform into all things without ever wasting—thus even they cannot always indulge in excess. It is because they do not indulge in excess that they achieve such breadth. Examined in human affairs, it is also that frugality brings breadth.\n\nNot daring to lead the world, therefore, completes the vessel and makes it long-lasting.\nHuizong’s annotation: The Dao does not contend yet triumphs—this is Heaven’s way. The Dao’s exaltation makes it the longest-lasting vessel.\nExegesis: Heaven is the parent of all things, transforming and nurturing, silently revolving in the boundless void. All things move and act through its mechanisms; those that emerge, it aids without hesitation; those that return to their roots, it guides without obstruction. It follows things’ natural course, aligning with their inherent principles.\nYet those confined by the numbers of birth and death all receive their mandates here, unable to escape its keys—thus, the Dao does not contend yet triumphs.\nThe Dao’s exaltation is first among all things, and none can demean it; hence, it is the longest-lasting vessel.",

      "translated_text": "---\n\n「Laozi states: *The sage employs the Way of the feminine*—when used, it becomes the foundation for leadership.\nHuizong’s annotation: The sage comprehends the Dao’s boundless nature, dwelling in the world as though in a realm of non-contention, and none dare contend with him. The Great Dao already flows—how could it not be that which the world follows first, thus attaining the status of the longest-lasting vessel?\n\nNow, abandoning the Way of the feminine yet clinging to the masculine, abandoning frugality yet seeking extravagance, abandoning humility yet aspiring to preeminence—this is the path of death.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: The world’s people know that courage suffices to overcome others, yet do not know that compassion alone can foster true courage. They know that generosity can dazzle the multitude, yet do not know that restraint alone can sustain true abundance. They know that leadership is esteemed, yet do not know that yielding precedence is the essential key. Thus, they are but the followers of brute strength, and their way is one of death.\n\nExegesis: The Three Treasures are the true essence of nature, not contrivances of human artifice. Only when one forgets both self and object can they truly treasure and uphold them. The world’s people, however, chase after superficial truths while abandoning the genuine, blinded to ultimate principles. They oppose objects with their own ego, clashing at every turn, knowing only that courage suffices to overcome others, boasting in strength, yet unaware that compassion alone can forge invincibility—*as the scriptures say: \"The seven virtues make one unstoppable.\"* They know that generosity can dazzle the multitude, indulging in ostentation, yet fail to grasp that restraint alone can ensure true abundance—*as the sages say: \"Use it without exhausting it.\"* They know that leadership is esteemed, striving to excel in ability, yet do not understand that yielding precedence is the true path—*as the scriptures say: \"He who yields precedence is first among men.\"* These are but the followers of rigidity and force; their way is one of death. Hence it is said: *The obstinate die the death of the strong.*\n\nIn ancient times, Zhuangzi spoke of the *Perfect Person* (博大真人) and said: *\"He is always expansive toward things, never diminished by others—thus, compassion is known.\"* *\"He moves with ease yet never wastes—taking moderation as his standard—thus, frugality is known.\"* *\"While others take precedence, he alone takes last—thus, he does not dare to lead the world first.\"* If Laozi were such a man, he could truly be said to embody these teachings, not only manifesting them in words but also demonstrating them in deed. Yet the world’s people pick up these fragments and call them *rigidity and strength*, risking their own lives without reflection. Truly, they are the *blinded and deluded masses.*\n\nCompassion, when wielded like a shield, becomes invincible. When held as a fortress, it becomes unshakable.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: The virtuous man is unstoppable in the world—thus, compassion makes him invincible in battle. The people love their ruler as hands and feet defend the head, as children protect their parents and elder siblings—dying for him without hesitation. Thus, compassion makes him unshakable in defense.\n\nExegesis: Mencius said: *\"When a ruler loves virtue, the world has no rival.\"* That is, the virtuous man is unstoppable in the world, for the people’s affection lies in virtue. The virtuous man, without rival, can thus awaken great benefit and align with the great harmony. The people’s return to virtue is like water flowing downward—inevitable. Thus, compassion makes him invincible in battle, achieving total victory. The *Book of Documents* says: *\"The people have no constant grievance, only grievance when virtue is absent.\"* Xunzi said: *\"The people love their ruler as hands and feet defend the head, as children protect their parents and elder siblings.\"* Therefore, when the people’s loyalty is rooted in virtue, compassion makes him unshakable in defense.\n\nIn ancient times, King Tang of Shang conquered through kindness and virtue, and thus his courageous deeds were celebrated, none daring to refuse his offerings. This was the virtuous man’s unstoppable way in the world. King Tai of Zhou had boundless virtue, so the people of Qin followed him as though returning to their marketplace. This was the people’s love for their ruler. Those above, with virtue and benevolence, are unstoppable; those below, with sincere and willing hearts, love their ruler. Thus, compassion makes him invincible in battle, unshakable in defense.\n\nCompassion as a treasure—how could its value be slight? Heaven, when it would save and protect, does so with compassion.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: Those who aspire to virtue are drawn by Heaven’s favor. Those who reject virtue are stripped by Heaven’s judgment. Thus, Heaven saves and protects through compassion alone—this is why compassion is first among the Three Treasures.\n\nExegesis: Those who exhaust their hearts know their nature. Those who know their nature know Heaven. Virtue is rooted in the inherent nature of all beings, a mandate from Heaven. Only by embodying virtue can one fulfill their nature; only by fulfilling their nature can one align with Heaven. Thus, those who aspire to virtue are drawn by Heaven’s favor—*as the scriptures say: \"Nurture the good, bless the benevolent, bestow a hundred blessings upon those who do good.\"* Those who reject virtue are stripped by Heaven’s judgment—*as the scriptures say: \"Overturn the wicked, punish the licentious, bring a hundred calamities upon those who do evil.\"* Therefore, those who follow the Dao are good, and those who lead with goodness are virtuous. Heaven’s Way is impartial, always rewarding the good. It saves them to make them secure, protects them to make them steadfast—all because of their goodness in compassion. This is why compassion is first among the Three Treasures, and also why virtue is the overarching name for all goodness, the consummation of humanity’s path. None can surpass the love of virtue.\n\n*The Great Learning of the True Classic (道德真经疏义) concludes Volume XII, begins Volume XIII.*",

      "translated_text": "The *Great Learning of the True Classic* (《道德真经疏义》), Volume XIII, Chapter LXVIII: **\"The Virtuous Scholar Does Not Rely on Force\"**\n\nThe virtuous scholar does not rely on force.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Force is the lower path; the scholar’s virtue lies in cultivating *ren* and *yi* alone.\nConfucius said: *\"I have not studied military affairs.\"*\n\n*The Causal Exegesis explains:* The maneuvers of the three armies and five weapons are but the lesser applications of virtue. What is lesser was practiced by the ancients, yet not their priority—thus, force is the lower path. The scholar’s aspiration lies in the Dao, so cultivating noble intent is paramount.\n*The Records* say: *\"The scholar’s first concern is intent.\"*\nZhuangzi said: *\"The worthy scholar values intent.\"*\nAll speak of the scholar’s purpose being to uphold lofty and enlightened intent, not to labor over the lesser applications of virtue. What intent should be cherished? Simply *ren* and *yi*.\n\nTo dwell in *ren* is to find a secure abode, fostering a heart that cannot bear to harm others. Thus, to kill the innocent is not *ren*.\nTo follow *yi*’s straight path means taking only what is just. Thus, to take what is not yours is not *yi*.\nThe virtuous scholar does not rely on force, nor does he delight in killing to harm *ren*, nor in taking to harm *yi*.\nConfucius’ teachings also say: *\"I have not studied military affairs.\"*\n\nThus, if the scholar’s intent is in the Dao, how can he neglect the root—*ren* and *yi*—and act otherwise? This is why Zhongyou could be brave yet cowardly, earning reproach at the Sage’s gate.\n\nThe skilled warrior does not rage.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* The highest strategy is to subdue through planning, yet rage truly overcomes deliberation.\n*The Causal Exegesis explains:* The威 of virtue is perfected in tranquility and strength. The Sage’s martial prowess shines without haste, yet its effects arrive without movement; divine martial might does not kill, its influence is unfathomable yet profound. By calculating strategy, victory is secured at ten thousand *li*—even the wisest cannot devise such schemes. Though military doctrine values the highest strategy of subduing through planning, it achieves victory without battle. Why then resort to clashing arms and indulge in rage?\n\nThe Five Phases’ principle holds that wood overcomes earth, and among the Seven Emotions, rage overcomes thought. What is meant by *\"rage truly overcomes thought\"* is that it stems not from true virtue, but is driven by external influences. Yet the highest strategy of subduing through planning requires no rage at all.\n\nKing Wen’s display of righteous fury was but human rage in response to human rage. To match the people’s rage with rage is to share their breath, differing only in that it is not private fury. What is called *\"emitting rage without raging\"* is rage arising from non-rage. Only by understanding this can one speak of the skilled warrior not raging.\n\nThe one who best conquers enemies does not contend.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Contention is contrary to virtue. To fight for land fills the fields with the dead; to fight for cities fills the cities with the dead—victory and defeat remain undetermined.\n*The Causal Exegesis explains:* Arms are laid down yet mobilized in due time. The virtuous one displays virtue, not force, aligning with the people’s hearts and following their desires—thus, contention is contrary to virtue. To contend is to crave battle and delight in slaughter: fighting for land fills the fields with the dead, yet external threats remain unchecked; fighting for cities fills the cities with the dead, yet internal strife persists. If so, cycles of expansion and contraction ensue, with victory and defeat still uncertain.\n\nOnly the virtuous scholar does not rely on force to perfect his martial virtue, thus embracing *ren* without fail and revering *yi* without hesitation—this is to campaign with *ren* and *yi*.\nOnly the skilled warrior does not rage to fulfill his rage, thus acting with purpose and achieving merit—this is to wield威 without raging.\nOnly the one who best conquers enemies does not contend to suppress contention, thus winning in battle and holding firm in defense—this is to conquer without contention.\n\nBy this, the realm is preserved, achievements secured, the people at ease, and the masses harmonized. The seven virtues of martial prowess lie here. These three principles all stem from virtue. Since they stem from virtue, their perfection is evident—thus, they are called *shàn* (virtuous).\n\nThis is the constant virtue underlying martial affairs—what makes *constant martial virtue* beautiful?\n\nThe skilled user of men is beneath them.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Though wisdom encompasses heaven and earth, the Sage does not deliberate alone—thus, the wise are employed for counsel. Though ability exhausts the land, the Sage does not act alone—thus, the capable are employed for service. Though eloquence carves through all things, the Sage does not speak alone—thus, the eloquent are employed as messengers.\n\n*The Causal Exegesis explains:* Those who embody the Dao act without action yet are honored; those who handle affairs act with action yet are burdened. The Sage must act without action to govern the world—this is embodying the Dao. The subjects must act with action to serve the world—this is handling affairs. Only by embodying the Dao does one assign responsibility to those who handle affairs. Only by acting without action does one employ those who act with action.\n\nThus, the Sage’s wisdom, though vast as heaven and earth, does not deliberate alone—this is to say wisdom permeates the divine, yet he employs others’ wisdom, so the wise are his counselors, as the saying goes: *\"The utmost wisdom does not plot.\"*\nThough ability exhausts the land, the Sage does not act alone—this is to say he employs others’ abilities, so the capable serve as his agents, as the saying goes: *\"Great skill appears as clumsiness.\"*\nThough eloquence carves through all things, the Sage does not speak alone—this is to say he employs others’ eloquence, so the eloquent serve as his messengers, as the saying goes: *\"Great eloquence does not speak.\"*\n\nThus, by not self-using, others willingly serve him. This is called the virtue of non-contention.\n*Huizong’s Annotation:* Virtue transcends reputation; knowledge arises from contention. Those whose talents are whole yet whose virtue is unseen have never been heard to initiate—only to harmonize with others.",

      "translated_text": "「Huizong’s commentary states: The *clever* exhaust their sight and hearing, the *capable* exhaust their planning and abilities, yet those who hold positions know nothing.\n\nThe *Explanations of Meaning* say: Those entrusted with the tasks of ears and eyes must surely possess *cleverness* to exhaust their sight and hearing. For those who discern through vision, clarity comes first; those who perceive through hearing, *cleverness* is prized. Only by letting the near reveal their clarity and the distant reveal their *cleverness* can one fully grasp the myriad circumstances of all things.\n\nThose entrusted with the tasks of the heart and strength must surely possess *capable* wisdom to exhaust their planning and abilities. For those skilled in planning, their wisdom is unobstructed; those skilled in strength, their vigor is unflagging. Only by internally wielding their wisdom and externally diligently applying their strength can one fully achieve the results of their undertakings.\n\nThe Sage surveys widely and listens inclusively, entrusts the *clever* and employs the *capable*—this is merely an excess of affairs. What enables them to utilize the world without self-assertion is their embodiment of the Dao’s *non-action* (wuwei). The *Classic* says:\n\n*\"Cleverness and wisdom, guard them with simplicity;\nBravery and strength to pacify the world, guard them with caution.\"*\n\nWhat is meant by *\"those who hold positions know nothing\"*? Does it not declare this truth? This is called *harmonizing with Heaven*—the ultimate of antiquity.\n\nHuizong’s commentary states: *Non-action* (wuwei) for action is what is called *Heaven*. Without contention yet employing others, one can thus *harmonize with Heaven*. To *harmonize with Heaven* is to reach the utmost; nothing can be added beyond this, hence it is called the *ultimate of antiquity*. *Ultimate* means *utmost*. The *house ridgepole* is the *utmost* of wood.\n\nThe *Explanations of Meaning* say: Heaven acts through *non-action* (wuwei) to maintain its clarity, and all things flourish, each following their natural growth from *non-action*. Thus, *non-action* for action is what is called *Heaven*.\n\nThe Sage engages in *non-action* (wuwei), thus aligning with Heaven’s *virtue/power*. Without contention yet employing others, it is as though the boundless void nurtures life—creation and transformation occur subtly, and the Sage merely entrusts the Six Qi (六氣) to their own unfolding. Hence, one can *harmonize with Heaven*. Those who record rituals say:\n\n*\"High and bright, harmonizing with Heaven,\nmust be followed by *non-action* (wuwei) to complete,\nthus aligning with Heaven’s *virtue/power*.\"*\n\nTo align with Heaven’s *virtue/power* is to ascend with the Creator of all things and transcend all existence—this is called *harmonizing with Heaven*. If so, then one has reached the *utmost*, beyond which nothing can be added, hence it is called the *ultimate of antiquity*.

      "translated_text": "「Thus, the *Huizong* commentary states: Those who *respond* are the *host* (主), those who *stimulate* are the *guest* (客). Only when pressed does one act, only when compelled does one rise—this is called *responsive warfare* (应兵). *Responsive warfare* is the *guest*’s way.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: The martial virtue of the sage does not rely on brute strength to turn the heavens and earth, yet the world cannot perceive its vigor; nor does it exhaust the wisdom of the gods, yet no one can fathom its depths. For those who command generals and lead armies like teachers, sharing the people’s sufferings—when *stimulated*, they *respond*, yet they dare not assert dominance. Only because they do not seek to overpower others, they are the *host* when *stimulated*, and the *guest* when *responding*. Pressed before they move, their actions are timely—this is the meaning of *\"arms are laid aside but act when the moment comes.\"* Compelled before they rise, their rise is decisive yet unavoidable—this is the meaning of *\"only when unavoidable do they act, and tranquility is the highest virtue.\"*\n\nIf so, then the first principle is to be *unconquerable*—waiting for the enemy’s conquerable moment to *respond* as *responsive warfare*, the *guest*’s way. As the *guest*, one displays the *prolonged weakness* (绵绵之弱), aligning with Sunzi’s saying: *\"The skilled victor stands in unconquerable ground.\"* One does not dare advance an inch but retreats a foot.\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: Because one does not delight in killing, advancing is difficult yet retreating is easy.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: Facing arrows and spears, confronting blades and barbs—by means of arms, it is harsh; by nature, it is perilous. How could one willingly engage in such warfare? The general’s purpose is only to curb violence, lay down arms, pacify the people, and harmonize the multitudes. The essence of command lies in self-preservation in warfare, and in halting the blades in martial virtue. It is never the intent to revel in killing. Because one does not delight in killing, advancing is difficult yet retreating is easy. Difficult to advance speaks to having something to defend—not cowardice in advancing, but knowing that defense alone ensures steadfastness. Easy to retreat speaks to having something to heed—not recklessness in retreating, but avoiding profit and courting danger. In the *Great Marshal’s* (《大司马》) teachings on battle formations, during hunting exercises, one is trained in sitting, rising, advancing, and retreating, with rhythms of swiftness, slowness, density, and sparseness. Sometimes, when the drum signals advance, one strikes the *bracelet* (镯) to regulate it; when the drum signals retreat, one sounds the *gong* (铙) to halt it. How much more so when facing the enemy—should one not carefully weigh the timing of advance and retreat?\n\nThe *Art of War* states: *\"Unmoving as a mountain, taking its steadfastness and stillness.\"* It also says: *\"Its swiftness like the wind, taking its speed and agility.\"* Only by understanding this can one grasp the profound meaning behind *\"not daring to advance an inch but retreating a foot\"*—this is the true essence.\n\nThis is called *\"action without action\"* (行无行).\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: The skilled warrior does not rely on martial force but acts without trace.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: Martial force is inferior to the *Dao/Way*; it is the lowest form of *virtue/power*. The warrior’s aspiration lies in the *Dao/Way* and is rooted in *virtue/power*, hence the skilled warrior does not rely on martial force. Moreover, even the grand armies of three divisions and five kinds of troops depend on the *spirit* and *movement* of the general’s will—so subtle as to be formless. How could martial force be visibly displayed? It is fitting that one acts without trace, that martial resolve lies in the will rather than in the deeds, and that its subtlety cannot be observed from the sidelines. There should be no need for the *phoenix* to parade in splendid towers or the *steed* to stand idle in the imperial stables, should there?\n\n*\"Defend without limbs\"* (攘无臂).\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: The skilled warrior does not rage.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: The benevolent must have courage, yet though they do not rage, their *威* (awe) remains. The *Odes* say: *\"Like thunder, like fury.\"* Though described as fury, it arises from non-fury—this is the meaning of *\"the skilled warrior does not rage.\"*\n\n*\"Unmatched without rival\"* (仍无敌).\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: The skilled victor over enemies does not contend.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: The benevolent have no rivals, yet though they do not contend, they prevail. The *Odes* say: *\"None dare contend in their season.\"* Only because they do not contend, others cease their contention—this is the meaning of *\"the skilled victor over enemies does not contend.\"*\n\n*\"Hold without arms\"* (执无兵).\n\nThe *Huizong* commentary states: One relies on others’ strength, hence there is no need to wield arms.\n\nThe *Explanatory Notes* say: The priority of arms is to attach to the people; the *Dao/Way* of warfare is to harmonize with them. Thus, the skilled in attaching to the people are the skilled in warfare. Benevolent rulers above and below, a hundred generals with one heart, three armies united in strength—like children serving their parents and brothers, like limbs protecting the head. When prolonged, it is like the long blade of *Mo Ye* (莫耶), and those who grasp it are severed; when sharp, it is like the keen edge of *Mo Ye*, and those who face it are routed. All this depends on the strength of others—what need is there to wield arms?\n\nMencius said: *\"One who commands awe over the world does not rely on the sharpness of arms, but gains the *Dao/Way* and receives much assistance.\"* The utmost of receiving assistance means the world submits to it; there are some conflicts one does not engage in, yet when one does, victory is certain—this is the meaning of *\"relying on others’ strength.\"* To form the *arc* and *arrow* to command awe over the world is not to say one does not rely on the sharpness of arms. It is to say that *root* triumphs over *branch*—the emphasis lies in the strength of others, not in the sharpness of arms. This is the meaning of *\"no need to wield arms.\"*」",

      "translated_text": "Mencius said: *\"He who does not delight in killing can unite the world. Then it is known that those who delight in killing cannot achieve their ambitions in the world—this aligns with the words of Laozi without prior agreement.*\n\nThus, when armies clash in confrontation, the compassionate will prevail. The *Huizong* commentary states: *\"The Sage’s use of arms is to rescue the people from fire and water, taking only the remnants of the wicked. Divine and martial, yet refraining from killing, the Sage treasures compassion as his jewel. Thus, *ren* (virtue/power of benevolence) permeates the world without fail, and *yi* (virtue/power of righteousness) commands reverence, making this the way of constant victory.\"*\n\nThe *Shuyi* (explanatory notes) say: *\"The Sage rules the world, nurturing the people as a father. Heaven covers, Earth sustains, the seas embrace and spring nurtures—how could the Sage allow these people to perish in suffering without restraining their violence? Therefore, when forced to use arms to rescue the people from fire and water, taking only the remnants of the wicked, the tyrant has no place to stand.*\n\nWho but the wise and enlightened, divine and martial yet refraining from killing, could match this? Indeed, the divine and martial who refrain from killing do not subjugate all things through sheer force—this is how they win hearts and minds, drawing them with *virtue/power* and treasuring compassion as their jewel. Yet, what is this *virtue/power*? It is merely *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness).*\n\nThus, when *ren* (benevolence) permeates the world without fail, it is because the Sage abhors harming others—this is the meaning of *ren* (benevolence) embracing all. When *yi* (righteousness) commands reverence, it is because the Sage upholds order and abhors chaos—this is the meaning of *virtue/power* and awe inspiring fear. But if it is said that the Sage treasures compassion as his jewel and that *ren* (benevolence) embraces all, while *yi* (righteousness) commands fear, how is this possible?\n\nIt is because when *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness) are practiced, both awe and love are achieved—compassion allows for courage. This aligns with Zhuang Zhou’s words: *‘Naturally benevolent and compassionate, yet never forgetting to use benevolence as a gift and righteousness as principle.’* If *ren* (benevolence) embraces all and *yi* (righteousness) commands fear, then the people will willingly submit, their hearts content and their minds sincerely obedient. The next level of victory is truly insignificant—this is the way of constant victory, is it not?\n\nIn ancient times, King Tang of Shang ruled with *‘not competing, not contending’* to spread his governance, thus exhausting the work of *ren* (benevolence). He wielded *‘not startling, not moving’* to display his courage, thus exhausting the work of *yi* (righteousness). Both *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness) fully realized, he could act without constraint and yet gather the fruits of victory—who would dare resist? Is this not the way of constant victory rooted in *ren* (benevolence) and *yi* (righteousness)?\n\nMy words are very easy to understand, very easy to practice.\"",

      "translated_text": "The world cannot know it, cannot practice it.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: The Dao shines brightly and is easy to see, hence when it is expressed in words, it is very easy to know; it is essential and easy to uphold, hence when it manifests in deeds, it is very easy to practice.\n\nMencius said: \"The Dao is like a great road—how difficult could it be to know?\"\n\nThus, the Dao has no difficulty, and the world has no one who cannot grasp it. Yet there are those who deceive themselves into believing they cannot—it is only because they do not reflect and seek within themselves.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: The Dao is lofty and beautiful, shining brightly and easily seen, hence when expressed in words, it is as clear as the sun and stars, making it very easy to know. The Dao is unified and penetrates all things, essential and easy to uphold, hence when seen in deeds, it is precise as a level and plumb line, making it very easy to practice.\n\nIf we clarify this through the teachings of the Six Classics, the Dao becomes even more evident and easy to grasp. For instance:\n- The *Book of Poetry* teaches *wēnróu dūnhòu* (gentle, kind, and thickly virtuous),\n- The *Book of Documents* teaches *shūtōng zhīyuǎn* (open and far-reaching),\n- And so on, extending to *guǎngbó yìliáng* (broad and easy to be good), *jiéjìng jīngwēi* (pure and refined), *gōngjiǎn zhuāngqīn* (reverent, frugal, and dignified), and the use of metaphor and analogy—all are manifestations of the Dao in words. By examining its expressions to seek its meaning, knowing it is not difficult.\n\nThe *Book of Poetry* guides the will,\nThe *Book of Documents* guides action,\nAnd so on—guiding conduct, guiding harmony, guiding yin and yang, guiding names and distinctions—all are manifestations of the Dao in deeds. By examining its deeds to understand its principles, practicing it is not difficult.\n\nTruly, Mencius’ words are profound: \"The Dao is like a great road—how difficult could it be to know?\" The Dao is the path all people share, like a great road. Traveling in and out, coming and going, none can stray beyond it. The world has no one who cannot grasp it, yet there are those who deceive themselves into believing they cannot—it is only because they walk in darkness, or wander into narrow paths, or turn back at cliffs, or abandon the way halfway. All this stems from their lack of reflection. The reason they cannot grasp it is that they do not reflect and seek within themselves.\n\nIf they knew that everyone holds something precious within themselves, and could reflect and seek within, then the Dao would be near—there is no need to seek it far away, and the Dao would dwell within them.\n\nLaozi’s teaching must say, *\"My words are very easy to know, very easy to practice.\"* Truly, he wished that all in the world and future generations would know to seek within themselves, to delve deeply into the Dao.\n\nWords have their root, deeds have their master.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: Words are boundless, yet principle is their foundation. Deeds are countless, yet the Dao is their sovereign.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: The expression of the heart’s voice arises spontaneously, without limit, and cannot be measured by clever calculations—this is why words are boundless. Yet they are expressed through metaphors and analogies, all of which are words, and though principle cannot be exhausted by these metaphors, it is never outside them. Thus, words have principle as their foundation.\n\nThe affairs of life are vast and endless, rushing by without measure—this is why deeds are boundless. Yet they are governed by standards and measures, all of which are deeds, and though the Dao cannot be sought in these standards, it is never separate from them. Thus, deeds have the Dao as their sovereign.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"When two households debate, which side’s argument is more biased in principle?\"* If one’s words must return to ultimate principle, then it is clear that words have principle as their foundation. Yet principle is called the foundation because it aligns with the saying *\"follow its root.\"*\n\nAgain, he said: *\"To unite with the One is to complete all things.\"* If deeds encompass the Dao and advance to it, then it is clear that deeds have the Dao as their sovereign. Yet the Dao is also called the master because it aligns with the saying *\"the key lies in the master.\"*\n\nPrinciple can be followed but not defied—if one seeks it in accordance with principle, they will find it. When principle flows naturally, then words align with it, and though it can be followed, it cannot be lost. Only by following the Dao in action can one truly embody it, making the heart harmonize with the Dao. Then deeds align with the Dao, words align with principle, and deeds align with the Dao—holding this as verification and standard, there is no action that cannot succeed. The world has no difficulty.\n\nTo say it is easy to know and easy to practice—how could it not be true?\n\nIt is only the ignorant who do not know me.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: The petty scholar’s knowledge does not transcend documents—though they claim knowledge, they truly lack it. How could they understand the Dao?\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: With a mind emptied and still, one can observe both near and far, delve into mysteries, uncover the hidden, and reach the profound—then wisdom is great indeed. The petty scholar’s wisdom is blinded by self-interest, and what they know does not extend beyond documents. Their spirit is wasted in shallow pursuits. Though they claim wisdom, it does not extend beyond the four seas—knowing the minutiae of hair and fur while ignorant of great peace, they claim knowledge yet truly lack it. How could they understand the Dao?\n\nWithout the Dao, one cannot truly know—because their knowledge cannot reach it.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"To know the Dao is easy.\"* Only through profound insight and discernment, by treating ignorance as true knowledge, can one truly know. The petty and selfish in wisdom are not free from burdens, and to seek true knowledge is indeed arduous.\n\nFew understand me, hence I am precious.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: Those with lofty conduct in the world are condemned by the crowd, and those with unique wisdom are startled by the people. Thus, there are those who are noble precisely because they are few.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: To stand out and excel is lofty conduct in the world.

      "translated_text": "The censure of others arises from their difference, and the scorn of the people stems from their arrogance—like the cuckoo mocking the progress of the *Nanqi* stream, or the well-frog belittling the joys of the Eastern Sea. How often one sees their lack of measure!\n\nTo seek the reason for this, they are obscured by one-sided views, and their limited clarity is insufficient to attain true knowledge.\n\nThe *Transmission* says: There is nothing in the world more esteemed than the **Dao**. The **Dao** is esteemed above all because it cannot be known by knowing.\n\nIf shallow perception and meager understanding were sufficient to grasp the **Dao**, then what would make the **Dao** so precious?\n\nOnly because few understand me, am I precious.\n\nThe *Records* speak of those who are noble because they are few—truly, this lies in the fact that few understand me, hence I am esteemed by the world.\n\nThus, the Sage wears coarse robes while harboring precious jade.\n\n**Huizong’s annotation:** The Sage is hidden within Heaven, yet does not peddle himself in the marketplace.\n\n**Cushui commentary:** The subtle essence of the **Dao** is never openly displayed, and the origin of things from the **Dao** is never known. The Sage is the ultimate of the **Dao**, merging with Heaven in emptiness—his concealment is profound.\n\nFrom the perspective of his completeness within Heaven, he follows the natural order of Heaven, rests in its equilibrium, and moves without progress as Heaven’s play, acts without strife as Heaven’s mechanism. Observing Heaven without interference, rejoicing in Heaven without sorrow—these are all harmonizing with Heaven through Heaven, employing wondrous yet effortless use, surpassing mere goodness. To exert force and conceal it is to be hidden within Heaven.\n\nNow, to hide a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh may be called secure, yet there are times when it is lost. To hide gold in mountains or pearls in the depths may be called secret, yet there are times when it is lost. This is because what is hidden is in things, not in the **Dao**.\n\nThe Sage returns to the origin of nature, uniting with Heaven as one—how different this is! How could he take pleasure in worldly affairs, selling himself like a merchant?\n\nThe pretense of virtuous conduct is akin to selling jade as stone. The self-promotion of skill is like hawking techniques for gold. Not selling himself in the marketplace, the brightest virtue appears as humiliation, and great virtue seems as foolishness—this is to show that it has never emerged from his lineage.\n\nTo show that it has never emerged from his lineage, it is fitting that even the later generations cannot compare.\n\nTo know what is unknown is exalted.\n\n**Huizong’s annotation:** The essence of the supreme **Dao** is dim and obscure; the extreme of the **Dao** is hazy and silent. Knowing transcends it externally, while ignorance resides within it; knowing is shallow, while ignorance runs deep. To say \"I do not know\" is true knowing—the ultimate of the **Dao**, hence it is exalted.\n\n**Cushui commentary:** To emerge and interact with things is to reach no limit; to retreat and discern within is to reach a limit. The **Dao** attains its ultimate when it retreats to discern within things.\n\nTo retreat and discern within things is beyond what can be known by knowing—how much more so when it is dim and obscure, merging in the undifferentiated chaos, the spirit of spirits, yet able to refine itself? How much more so when it is hazy and silent, hidden beyond speech and intent, where things cannot be measured, yet all consider it the extreme?\n\nWho would say that knowing can seek its ultimate?\n\nBroadly, Guangchengzi said: \"The essence of the supreme **Dao** is dim and obscure; the extreme of the **Dao** is hazy and silent\"—this is because the **Dao** is not something that knowing can know.\n\nWhen Taiqing asked about the boundless, he said, *\"I do not know.\"* When asked about non-action, he said, *\"I know.\"* The **Dao** uses these two statements—how does one determine which is correct and which is false?\n\nThis is because one has not yet understood that *not-knowing* is knowing, and knowing is *not-knowing*. This is why there are distinctions of depth and shallowness, interior and exterior. Thus, it is said: knowing transcends it externally, while ignorance resides within it; knowing is shallow, while ignorance runs deep.\n\nOnly knowing what is unknown is true knowing.\n\nIf so, then transcending form and emerging beyond the realm of being and non-being, standing aloof without associating with things—one can intuitively grasp it in silence.\n\nWhat in the world is more exalted than this? Hence it is said: *To know what is unknown is exalted.*\n\nTo not know what is known is a sickness.\n\n**Huizong’s annotation:** To not know the essence of the supreme **Dao** while knowing the coarse aspects of things, to not know the extreme of the **Dao** while knowing the trivial ends of things—already enslaved to trifles, already entangled by things, yet they say they tread the path of sorrow and calamity. Hence, it is a sickness.\n\n**Cushui commentary:** Clarity arises from emptiness, awareness from stillness. The realm of Taiqing is initially free of any obstruction. Once false perceptions arise, the empty and still mind is suddenly immersed in things, and what is known is coarse while the supreme essence remains unknown, what is known is trivial while the supreme extreme remains unknown—these are all cases of those who do not know what is known.\n\nAlready enslaved to trifles, already entangled by things, yet they daily sink into the domain of sorrow and exhaustion. What sickness is greater? How could those who seek detachment prescribe remedies to rid them of the eight flaws and four afflictions, so they may naturally attain the tranquil realm of Taiqing?\n\nOnly by recognizing sickness as sickness can one truly be free from sickness.\n\n**Huizong’s annotation:** To know one’s own foolishness is not great foolishness. To know one’s own confusion is not great confusion. Great confusion lasts a lifetime without resolution, and great foolishness lasts a lifetime without enlightenment.\n\n**Cushui commentary:** Foolishness is ignorance without wisdom; confusion is doubt without clarity—both are ailments of nature. These ailments align with Confucius’ statement that the people have three afflictions.\n\nOnly by knowing this and discerning it can one resolve the obscurations and dispel the confusions. Zhuangzi said: *To know one’s own foolishness is not great foolishness; to know one’s own confusion is not great confusion*—this is why.\n\nIndeed, to know one’s foolishness, to know one’s confusion—this is the sick speaking of their sickness.

The Sage’s freedom from disease lies in their treating the disease—hence, they are not afflicted.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The Sage is naturally pure (素逝) and shuns worldly involvement (耻通於事), yet they establish the fundamental principles (立本) and comprehend divine unity (通於神)—this is true knowledge. Yet they always appear as though they do not know, and so they are not afflicted.\n\n**Cushui commentary:** *Naturally pure* (素) means untainted by the mundane; *pure and unconstrained* (逝) means they do not fail to traverse all things. Only by being naturally pure and unconstrained can one shun worldly involvement (不蕲通於事), yet all worldly matters become transparent to them (事無不通). This is because they have established the fundamental principles of the Dao/Way (立之本原), and so their wisdom unites with the divine (知通於神).\n\nFor the fundamental principles (本原) are the essence of the Dao/Way.

Yet they always appear as though they do not know, and so who could possibly weary their hearts?\n\nZhuangzi said that the man who is naturally pure and unconstrained, yet shuns worldly involvement, and who establishes the fundamental principles while comprehending divine unity, is a man of *Kingly Virtue/Power* (王德之人)—this is why.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two of *The People Do Not Fear the Great Menace* (民不畏威):**\nWhen the people do not fear the great menace, then the great menace has indeed arrived.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The petty man regards minor vices as harmless and does not abandon them; thus, the vices accumulate and cannot be concealed.

Yet the people are born with thick ignorance (民生厚), and their inclinations shift with external influences (因物有迁). They abandon truth for illusion (舍真逐妄), delight in superficial ornamentation (外悦纷华), and engage in conflict over paths of gain and loss (交战於利害之涂) while remaining oblivious to fear. They regard minor good deeds as useless and do not perform them, and minor vices as harmless and do not abandon them. Thus, their evils accumulate beyond concealment (恶积而不可揜), and their crimes grow vast beyond absolution (罪大而不可解).\n\nThis is what Zhuangzi meant by *those who suffer external punishments at night* (宵人之罹外刑), and what the *Yijing* meant by *bearing a burden and losing one’s ears—disaster.* (荷校灭耳，凶)\n\nDoes not their pursuit of gain and avoidance of loss reveal that they do not fear the great menace?

      "translated_text": "「Do not narrow their dwelling,」\n---\n\n**Huizong’s annotation:** Dwelling is the abode of one’s nature; human nature is boundless and cannot be confined, yet those of narrow understanding cannot be spoken to of the Dao/Way because they restrict their dwelling.\n\nIf expanded and filled, it will overflow to fill Heaven and Earth, embrace the six extremes, and nothing will be able to contain it. Mencius said: *Dwell in the broadest dwelling of the world.* The *cushui* commentary states: In the boundless expanse of the Great Peace, it fills Heaven and Earth without limit to its boundaries, circulates through the six voids without end to its traces, so that the abode of one’s nature is vast and cannot be confined—its grandeur is boundless.\n\nThose in the world who are ignorant, confined by their own narrowness, see only things and not the Dao/Way. They dig through walls and plant weeds, and their dwelling begins to narrow—because those of narrow understanding cannot be spoken to of the Dao/Way.\n\nIf one seeks its vastness and fluidity to restore the nature’s original state, there must be those who act with resolve to open the way. Then obstacles will be overcome, blockages will be cleared, and if expanded and filled, it will rise to the heights and spread to the depths, covering all beneath Heaven and embracing the six extremes. Its dwelling will be the broadest, yet never will it be confined or petty.\n\nThis is what Mencius meant by *dwelling in the broadest dwelling of the world*—it is also because they do not narrow their dwelling.\n\nZhuangzi said: *The fenced enclosures of the Bowei, the orchards of the Yellow Emperor, the palaces of the Yu, and the halls of Tang and Wu.* Truly, the Dao/Way descends ever lower, and thus their dwelling becomes ever narrower.\n\n**Do not weary of what they produce.**\nHuizong’s annotation: Production is the gathering of *qi*; human life aligns with the transformations of all things, yet those who weary of their production say: *The deeds of a single day can lead to death or loss.* The reversals of this fate mean that the *qi* of night is insufficient to sustain them. Those who preserve the Great Harmony and avoid untimely death do so because they do not weary of what they produce.\n\nThe *cushui* commentary states: Human life is a mingling of coarse and refined, changing to form *qi*, *qi* changing to form shape, shape changing to form life—so life is but a fleeting gathering of *qi*. All who receive the *qi* of yin and yang to form their shape: at night, they rest with yin; within, they interweave with things. By day, they move with yang; without, they engage with things. Human life is inherently aligned with the Dao/Way of day and night and the transformations of all things.\n\nThus, when interweaving with things, all thoughts cease and turn inward; when engaging with things, all threads arise and respond fluidly. If one does not know how to preserve life to defend oneself, but instead exhausts oneself in myriad ways, it is as Mencius said: *The deeds of a single day can lead to death or loss.*\n\nThe reversals of fate are not uniform; even if the *qi* of night is insufficient to sustain them, their failure to preserve a good heart is rare indeed. Only those who guard pure *qi*, nourishing it with uprightness and without harm, will find that the Great Harmony of Heaven and Earth is enough to preserve them—keeping them from scattering, keeping them from departing.\n\nThus can they preserve life and fulfill their years, never meeting untimely death. Is it not because they do not weary of what they produce that this is achieved?\n\nIt is only because they do not weary that they do not weary. Huizong’s annotation: Misfortune and fortune come from no other source than one’s own actions.\n\nThe *cushui* commentary states: Honor and disgrace arrive as reflections of one’s *virtue/power*. Misfortune and fortune have no fixed gate—only human actions summon them. Thus, the rewards for good and evil, calamity and blessing, follow their kind. There is none who does not reap what they themselves have sown.\n\nThen, if the refined *qi* of the Five Phases is attuned, and the spirit is prepared to receive all things, those endowed with nature’s original *virtue/power* who seek to avoid wearied production must truly not weary of their own life.\n\nIn ancient times, a farmer who tended crops recklessly plowed too deeply and hoed too harshly, and thus his crops suffered accordingly. But when he plowed deeply and harrowed carefully, his crops flourished and grew. Who would say that cultivating the body and refining the heart is not like the farmer’s lesson?\n\nThose who cultivate life well should understand this. Hence, the Sage knows themselves but does not display themselves, cherishes themselves but does not exalt themselves—so they abandon that and take this.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: The Sage has clarity in self-knowledge, yet does not parade their abilities; they have benevolence in self-cherishing, yet do not lord over others. Such beings act in the world without harming it, and the world cannot harm them.\n\nThey delight in the Dao/Way of Heaven and have no sorrow—what is there to fear in the threats of anger?\n\nThe Sage’s choices in abandoning and taking are now clear.\n\nThe *cushui* commentary states: Self-knowledge is clarity; the Sage has clarity in self-knowledge. Though their insight extends without limit, how could they parade themselves to boast of their abilities? Only by not parading themselves to boast of their abilities does one attain the height of wisdom. Those who parade themselves do not understand.\n\nSelf-cherishing is the utmost of benevolence; the Sage cherishes themselves with benevolence. Though they widely bestow and aid all, how could they exalt themselves to belittle others? Only by not exalting themselves over others does one attain the height of love. Those who exalt themselves are, in truth, belittled by others.\n\nWith this, they govern the multitude and thus can settle the world in peace, stability, and great harmony. Acting in the world without harming it, the world cannot harm them.\n\nIt is fitting that they delight in the Dao/Way of Heaven to preserve the world, yet fear no threats of anger.\n\nThe Sage’s choices in abandoning and taking—how could they be outside of self-knowledge without display and self-cherishing without exaltation?\n\n---\n**Boldly daring but not daring is death; boldly daring but not daring is life.**\nHuizong’s annotation: The rigid and strong are doomed to destruction. The yielding and weak are preserved in life. Those who boldly dare are capable only of daring. Capable of daring yet unable to retreat is not true virtue—it is merely enough to destroy their body.

      "translated_text": "Liezi said: *\"There exists an eternal Dao/Way of victory in the world—it is called Softness.\"*\n\n**Exegesis:** The rigid perishes; the sharp is blunted. The strong and unyielding are doomed to destruction. Softness overcomes hardness; weakness overcomes strength. Thus, the soft and weak are preserved in life.\n\nYet the world’s people know only to dare boldly, advancing resolutely without regard—never realizing that supreme softness can traverse the world’s greatest hardness. This is the Dao/Way’s true function: enduring and ever-present.\n\nZilu, though he wandered at the Sage’s gate, did not grasp the Dao/Way’s use. He could not restrain his reckless strength—daring yet unable to retreat—so where could he find true worth? It was enough only to destroy his body.\n\nBut those who know to embrace the雄 (heroic) while guarding the雌 (receptive) are not incapable of daring. Rather, they dwell in softness and stillness, yielding with things like a serpent’s coils, returning to the innocence of an infant. This is the daring of *not daring*—and thus, life.\n\nThus did Guangchengzi abide in harmony, refining his body for a thousand two hundred years without decay—precisely because he dared not dare.\n\nThe *Transmission* says: *\"To act last is to act first.\"* To dare not dare is to know the Dao/Way of holding back. To hold back is to act first.\n\nOnly those who know the eternal Dao/Way of victory in softness can be spoken to thus. Hence, Liezi said: *\"There exists an eternal Dao/Way of victory in the world—it is called Softness.\"*\n\nThese two paths—daring and not daring—bring either benefit or harm.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** Where there is rectitude, there is deviation. Where there is obstruction, there is suitability.\n\n**Exegesis:** What humans call \"arriving at the Dao\" is inversion; what the Dao calls \"arriving at humans\" is inversion. Those who dare boldly may seem to gain, but Heaven truly harms them. Those who dare not dare may seem to suffer, but Heaven truly benefits them.\n\nFor the principles of the world, where there is rectitude, there is deviation; where there is obstruction, there is suitability. They alternate and transform, waxing and waning naturally. Knowing these two paths makes the logic of benefit and harm clearly manifest.\n\nWhat does Heaven abhor? Who knows its reason?\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** The strange in humans aligns with the companion in Heaven. What benefits humans, Heaven abhors—who can know this?\n\n**Exegesis:** Humans have long been overcome by Heaven. Those blinded by human ways, thinking to conquer Heaven, act recklessly in ignorance. How could birds, strange to humans, align with Heaven?\n\nThus, Heaven’s petty ones are humanity’s virtuous; Heaven’s virtuous are humanity’s petty—this is the natural order. Hence, even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** Those who follow Heaven endure; those who defy it perish—even the Sage dares not alter this.\n\n**Exegesis:** To follow is auspicious; to defy is ominous. Thus, those who follow endure; those who defy perish. To know human actions, one must know Heaven’s actions.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"To act in accordance with it—is that difficult? Those who find it easy, Heaven does not favor.\"*\n\nThe Sage aligns with Heaven, harmonizing with the divine to assist in transformation and nurturing. Though seemingly without difficulty, even the Sage does not dare to alter much—what of those beneath?\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven does not contend yet achieves victory.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** When things emerge, Heaven allows them to emerge without resistance. When things return, Heaven allows them to return without obstruction—this is called *not contending*.\n\nTo fill and empty, to wax and wane—Heaven participates with all things, yet all things receive their mandate from it. This is called *not contending yet achieving victory*.\n\n**Exegesis:** Heaven’s movement knows no accumulation, and thus all things are completed. Only through movement without accumulation can it govern all things, transforming from non-being to being. The sun warms and nourishes all, so when things emerge, Heaven allows them to emerge without resistance. The yin consolidates, and all things are perfected, so when things return to their roots, Heaven allows them to return without obstruction.\n\nAs sovereign and regulator, it oversees myriad transformations, standing independently in the realm of non-contention. It sees the ebb and flow—one full, one empty—simply following the natural course of *qi*.\n\nMoreover, though myriad things exist, none escape its pivot. Thus, all receive their mandate here, and what surpasses this as the Dao/Way of victory?\n\nIt speaks not, yet responds perfectly.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** What does Heaven say? It changes with thunder and wind, demonstrating with calamity and blessing—no deviation, only resonant response.\n\n**Exegesis:** The thunder and wind stir all things. Heaven’s blessings reward the virtuous; its punishments befall the licentious. Heaven’s vastness cannot be rushed—its transformations are subtle, operating silently in the boundless void, embodying supreme beauty without speech.\n\nIts means of change: perhaps the thunder stirs, the wind disperses—always in accordance with the season. Its means of instruction: perhaps it blesses the virtuous, punishes the licentious—always in accordance with their kind.\n\nYet its responses are swift, with no deviation—like shadows following form, echoes following sound. It never favors its responses. What does Heaven say?\n\nIt does not summon, yet they come.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** Those who receive their mandate can summon them. The chaos of myriad things is governed by Heaven’s decree—who can summon them? It simply follows the unceasing flow of *qi*.\n\n**Exegesis:** The *Qian* (Creative) is sovereign, the first to emerge among all things; it is father, the origin of all. Ministers receive their mandate from the sovereign; children obey their father—thus, those who issue the mandate can summon them.\n\nOnly by issuing the mandate can one govern all things, commanding all movement.",

      "translated_text": "「All living things, in their myriad confusion, exist within an incalculable expanse—none can be summoned by any means. Unable to summon, yet they come; unable to compel, yet they arrive. Endlessly circulating without pause, they move through the boundless void, their transformations subtle and imperceptible, their **Dao/Way** unceasing, as **qi** flows naturally of its own accord, knowing not whence it springs yet simply is. Tranquil yet shrewd in counsel.\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** Virtue and power are always easy to discern, yet perilous to grasp. Tranquility is ease; shrewd counsel is knowing peril. The **Qian** (Creative) accumulates three **yang** to form its substance—this is called **ultimate health**. Though perilous, if virtue and power remain easy, even the **yin**’s dangers cannot ensnare them. Does the *I Ching* not speak in *The Upper Appendices* of **Qian** knowing through ease, and in the *Qian* hexagram’s ninth line, of discerning the emergence of a single **yin**—then using it to bring about auspiciousness? Is this not the meaning of tranquil yet shrewd in counsel?\n\nThe **Heavenly Net** is vast and sweeping, though its mesh is wide yet never misses. **Huizong’s Annotation:** Though dense, it has gaps—this is human action. Heaven, though sparse, has no gaps. Accumulated virtue brings blessings; accumulated vice brings calamities—each responds in kind, thus nothing is ever lost. Yet those who strive only to win, who speak only to be answered, are human. Heaven does not strive yet wins effortlessly, does not speak yet responds perfectly—when summoned, it comes. Only the foolish fail to grasp Heaven’s **Dao/Way**.\n\nHeaven does not summon yet they come; tranquil yet shrewd in counsel—only the **sage** can embody this. Thus, they do not pursue self-interest nor obstruct harm, always benefiting without causing harm, aligning with Heaven’s **virtue/power** and differing from those who dare boldly. **Exegesis:** Heaven follows **principle** (*li*); humans follow **emotion** (*qing*). Following emotion means favoring personal views—though meticulous, they lack comprehensive insight, hence the gaps. Following principle means upholding universal harmony—though sparse, they cannot be evaded, hence no gaps. Thus, though dense with gaps, this is human action. Accumulated virtue must bring blessings; accumulated vice must bring calamities—each befalls its kind, never failing. Is the **Heavenly Net** then deliberate in this? Its judgments on misfortune and fortune arise from inherent causes, all self-inflicted.\n\nThe world’s people are blinded by partiality, ignorant of great **principle** (*li*), chasing trifles while forgetting the root—each path they tread brings new woes. Yet they fail to see that the **Dao/Way** of Heaven is clear and evident, always favoring the virtuous, while the wicked have no place to hide from its scrutiny. Moreover, to know Heaven’s actions and human actions is supreme. Striving only to win, speaking only to be answered, summoning only to bring about—these are all human. When humans cannot align with Heaven, they are but petty and self-serving. If you rid people of this petty wisdom, they will return to **principle**—how could Heaven’s **Dao/Way** be unaligned with humanity? How could humanity be unaligned with Heaven? Only the **sage** can embody this: turning countless petty defeats into grand victory, like Heaven’s effortless triumph; practicing the **Dao/Way** of silent teaching, like Heaven’s perfect response without words; acting in accordance with **principle** yet moving naturally, coming without being summoned, like Heaven’s spontaneous arrival; serene and unassuming, their spirit like divination—tranquil yet shrewd in counsel. If the **sage** does not act, misfortune and fortune do not arise—who then brings disaster? Thus, they do not pursue self-interest nor obstruct harm, always benefiting without causing harm. This passage begins with those who dare boldly—human—and ends with the **Heavenly Net**’s vast yet flawless judgment—divine. The **sage**’s alignment with Heaven’s **virtue/power** is fundamentally distinct from the bold daring of common folk. This is why the passage begins and ends as it does—to illuminate all under Heaven and for posterity. Scholars should ponder this deeply.\n\n**The People’s Common Disregard for Death (Chapter 74)**\nThe people do not commonly fear the **sword and saw** (execution’s tools), nor death itself—how can you frighten them with death?\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** The people have natural hearts, finding life joyous. If they lack this natural heart, why should they fear death? The **sword and saw** restrain them; the **measuring line and weights** (law’s strictures) kill them; the **mallet and chisel** (punitive tools) strike them—this is called frightening them with death. The people will only resist and never reform.\n\n**Exegesis:** From birth, the people are not inherently distinct—**Heaven** bestows upon them a pure spirit, a simple nature. They are the most refined of all creatures, the noblest of Heaven and Earth. Who does not delight in life and abhor death? Water, unobstructed yet easily swayed by external things, lacks constancy of heart. If they lack this natural heart, they will flout laws and evade prohibitions, doing whatever they please—until they fall into crime, whereupon punishment follows. Thus, these are people who do not fear death yet are frightened by it.\n\nOnly when the **sage** cultivates the virtue of cherishing life deeply in the hearts of the people will they know to rejoice in their own lives, naturally moving toward goodness and away from crime—thus avoiding conflict with officials and rendering punishments obsolete. Yet there are those restrained by the **sword and saw**, killed by the **measuring line and weights**, struck by the **mallet and chisel**, who resist yet never reform—are these not the same? If you make the people constantly fear death, and those who act strangely, I shall seize and execute them—who would dare? **Huizong’s Annotation:** All under Heaven take joy in life yet weigh heavily the crime of breaking laws. Only then will strange words be punished, eccentric deeds prohibited—if your crimes against governance are indeed grave.\n\n**Exegesis:** Once the people delight in life, nothing they desire is greater than life itself, nor do they abhor anything more than death—while breaking laws is the heaviest crime. Thus, the people each safeguard their natural inclinations toward life and death: words must have substance, so strange utterances cease, knowing they will be punished; actions must conform to **principle**, so eccentric deeds are rare, knowing they are forbidden. If you seize and execute them, the state will have enduring laws—seeking those who resist, I know none would dare. Indeed, if your crimes against governance are grave, this is precisely the intent.»",

If a substitute official executes, or a substitute carpenter wields the axe, this means the ruler and the people share the same **virtue/power**, reversing the **Dao/Way** and speaking contrary to it. How could such a ruler govern others if he himself is governed? King Wen of Zhou did not meddle in the myriad words, myriad legal cases, or myriad precautions, but only sought the proper officials to shepherd the people—this is why he succeeded.\n\n**Exegesis:** The ruler follows the **Dao/Way**, the ministers handle affairs. Those who follow the **Dao/Way** act without interference and are honored, thus they serve the ruler’s will. Those who handle affairs act with purpose and bear burdens, thus they serve the **Dao/Way** for the people. The distinction between ruler and minister is an unchanging **Dao/Way**. Only when each has fixed responsibilities that cannot be altered does the legal official execute, the carpenter wield the axe, and the ruler merely maintain his own decorum and face south.

      "translated_text": "「The *Commentary on the Daoist Classic of Virtue and Power* states:\n\n*\"To grasp the great **symbol/principle** (大象, *dàxiàng*), the world follows; when it follows without harm, there is peace and ease. The **Dao/Way** of the Sage in governing the world lies in attending to affairs of **non-interference** (無為, *wúwéi*), and practicing instruction without words. Thus, the Sage could place the world in a state of peace and ease, and how could there be any harm from a substitute’s axe?\n\nIn *The Answer to the King* of *Zhuangzi*, it is said: *'The **Dao/Way** of non-interference means full responsibility for affairs.'* This is the **Dao/Way** of non-interference where those entrusted with duties bear full responsibility.\n\nIt is fitting that at the end of the chapter, it states: *'The **Perfect One’s** (至人, *zhìrén*) use of the heart is like a mirror—neither pushing nor pulling, responding without hoarding. Thus, the **Perfect One** can overcome things without harming oneself.'*\n\n**Chapter 75 of the *Commentary on the Daoist Classic of Virtue and Power* (卷十三結):**\n*\"The people’s hunger arises from the excessive taxes of their superiors—this is why they starve.\"*\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** *\"When taxes are heavy, fields and crops are prone to neglect, and the people lack sufficient food.\"*\n\nThe *Commentary* states:\n*\"Mencius said: 'Transform their fields, reduce their taxes, and the people can be made rich; feed them according to season, use them with propriety, and wealth will be inexhaustible.' The Sage’s governance of the world ensures that the people can hold food to their chins and play, drum their bellies and stroll, saying that they enjoy sustenance and that the people are well-fed throughout the year. This is not merely achieved by lightening the taxes to nourish the people, but also by guiding them to abandon trivial pursuits and return to the fundamental **Dao/Way** (本, *běn*).\n\nIndeed, **virtue/power** (德, *dé*) lies in benevolent governance, and governance exists to enrich the people. In ancient times, those who understood this would survey the twelve regions of soil to discern their suitability, then teach the people the appropriate cultivation methods for each. They would assign land responsibilities, establish tribute systems, and reward those who succeeded in their tasks with the honor of *鄙師* (lowly teacher), while punishing those who failed with the blame of *載師* (burdened teacher). Thus, the people would all exert themselves in their fields, take joy in their work, and strive for success—so the common folk would not suffer from hunger.\n\nAt that time, they relished their food, admired their attire, unaware of the **Imperial Dao/Way’s** (帝力, *dìlì*) influence upon them. How could there be any calamity of neglected fields and insufficient food?\n\nThe people are difficult to govern because their superiors meddle in affairs—this is why they are difficult to govern.\"*\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** *\"When governance is burdensome, deceit and fraud proliferate, and the people lose their simplicity.\"*\n\nThe *Commentary* states:\n*\"The Sage relies on the **Dao/Way** in the world and governs through affairs. Though responding to the myriad things, the Sage remains rooted in the **Dao/Way’s** essence of non-interference. Even in the application of rewards and punishments, the Sage does not depart from the fundamental principle of *渊虚* (profound emptiness, *yuānxū*). Loving tranquility, the people naturally align; without burdensome affairs, the people naturally thrive; without desires, the people naturally remain simple. This is so because the Sage depends on **Dao/Way** transformation rather than clever schemes. Relying on **Dao/Way** transformation means governance is not burdensome; not depending on clever schemes means deceit and fraud cease, and the people return to their simplicity.\n\nThe *Classic* says: *'When governance is obscure and gentle, its people are pure and honest; when governance is scrutinizing and strict, its people are weary and corrupt.'* When governance is burdensome, deceit and fraud arise, and the people lose their simplicity—this is the meaning of *'governance is scrutinizing and strict, its people are weary and corrupt.'*\n\nPeople’s disregard for death arises from the depth of their attachment to life—this is why they lightly view death.\"*\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** *\"When life is cherished too deeply, the pursuit of gain becomes fervent, leading to reckless and licentious behavior, with no bounds.\"*\n\nThe *Commentary* states:\n*\"Life is what I desire, but there are things I desire more than life—this is why I would not obtain it at any cost. Death is what I abhor, but there are things I abhor more than death—this is why some misfortunes I would not avoid.\n\nThe people of the world do not understand this: they cling to what is weighty and discard what is light, thus excessively valuing life while neglecting righteousness. Those who would gain any advantage at all cost do so without restraint.\n\nBecause of their deep attachment to life, the people’s pursuit of gain is relentless—contending for fish, they are willing to get wet; chasing beasts, they are willing to run. To the point of losing their natural balance, they indulge in reckless and licentious behavior, doing whatever they please. Even when facing perilous risks, they regard death lightly. Though life is cherished too deeply, this very attachment leads to its destruction.\n\nOnly those who do not make life their primary concern are wiser than those who overly value it.\"*\n\n**Huizong’s Annotation:** *\"Zhuangzi said: 'Those who comprehend the essence of life do not labor for what life cannot provide.'*\n*Those who do not make life their primary concern do not labor for what life cannot provide*—this is abandoning affairs while relinquishing life.\n\nAbandoning affairs means the body is not taxed; relinquishing life means the essence is not depleted. When the body remains whole and the essence is restored, one aligns with the **Dao/Way** and becomes one with Heaven—this is why such individuals are wiser than those who overly value life. Though valuing life is different from regarding death lightly, abandoning life is even wiser than valuing it.\n\nExtending the principles that benefit my own life to the people, we see lightened taxes, simplified punishments, households with sufficient provisions, and people well-clothed. Yet the people do not transgress, and this is the ultimate achievement of the **Imperial Dao/Way** (帝王, *dìwáng*).\"*\n\nThe *Commentary* states:\n*\"The **Dao/Way** is fundamentally empty of things; your body is also empty. Even in the matters that concern your very existence, nothing is more vital than life—yet life is not truly yours to possess, for it is the **Heavenly Harmony** (天地之委和, *tiāndì zhī wěihé*) entrusted to you. Only by not claiming life as your own can you preserve it entirely. Thus, those who comprehend the essence of life—how could they labor for what life cannot provide?\n\nAlas, the people of the world believe that nourishing the body is sufficient to sustain life, yet nourishing the body ultimately fails to preserve life. They do not realize that without burdens, one remains balanced and upright; when balanced and upright, corrupt **qi** cannot assail, and **Heavenly Harmony** will naturally arrive, blending with their own vitality. Thus, they attain a renewed life.\n\nWithout burdens, one does not make life their primary concern; not making life their primary concern means they do not labor for what life cannot provide. This allows one to abandon affairs while relinquishing life.\n\nAbandoning affairs means the body is not taxed yet remains whole; relinquishing life means the essence is not depleted yet restored. When the body is whole and the essence is restored, **virtue/power** (德, *dé*) returns to its original state, and one aligns with the **Dao/Way**, becoming one with Heaven—this is why such individuals are wiser than those who overly value life. Though valuing life is different from regarding death lightly, abandoning life is even wiser than valuing it.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The **Sage** examines the means by which we nurture our life, and when applied to the people of the world, they bring about abundant governance and thriving populace. Light taxes and levies are seen, and clear laws bring the people into submission. Harsh punishments are avoided, yet families are well-provided and people are content—those above have what they need, those below have what they nurture—so the people naturally incline toward the realm of **virtue/power** (仁寿, *rénshòu*). Needles and saws are not employed, axes and chisels are not used, clothing and headgear are simply adorned, and garments are distinguished—yet the people do not transgress.\n\nThus, nobles and commoners fulfill their roles, and the **virtue/power** (德, *dé*) of the wise and the unworthy aligns with their nature. The Sage achieves the **Dao/Way** of great peace, and its brilliance matches the winds of the ancient times.\n\nExamining its source, one understands the principle of **non-action** (无为, *wúwéi*). The means by which we nurture our life is merely to apply it to the people.\n\nThus, the people have enough food and do not starve, return to simplicity and are not difficult to govern, and value life without regarding death lightly—this is the ultimate achievement of the **Emperor-King** (帝王, *dìwáng*), is it not?\n\n**Human life spans seventy-six years.**\nHuman beings are born soft and weak, yet in death they become hard and strong.\nGrasses and trees are born soft and brittle, yet in death they become withered and decayed.\n\nThus, those who are hard and strong are the followers of death, while those who are soft and weak are the followers of life.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** All things bear the yin and embrace the yang, blending their **qi** (冲气, *chōngqì*) to achieve harmony. The yang’s **virtue/power** (德, *dé*) lies in its ability to generate life, while the yin’s function is to bring about austerity and destruction.\n\nWhen the yin’s austerity prevails, the harmony of blending is lost.\nHence, it is said: the hard and strong are the followers of death, while the soft and weak are the followers of life.\n\n**Explanatory notes:** *Lǐzǐ* states: The transformations of yin and yang are called life and death.\n\nAll things flourish within Heaven and Earth, adorned by the strange pairings of yin and yang, confined by motion and stillness. None fail to bear the yin and embrace the yang, blending their **qi** (冲气, *chōngqì*) to achieve harmony.\n\nSpeaking of life and death, the yang **qi** is ever effusive, generating life as its **virtue/power** (德, *dé*), and all things thereby unfold and thrive—so the soft become hard, the weak become strong. The yin **qi** is ever congealed, bringing about austerity and destruction, and all things thereby wither and decay—so the hard are ruined, the sharp are blunted. As the **qi** subtly shifts, reaching the point of austerity and destruction, the harmony of blending is lost and returns to the utmost stillness.\n\nThose who serve the yin and yang in the world know that life and death alternate, yet they do not grasp the constant **Dao/Way** of victory: softness (柔, *róu*), nor the constant **Dao/Way** of defeat: hardness (刚, *gāng*). Thus, they abandon the principle of life and move toward the realm of death.\n\nFor the **Dao/Way** is the interplay of one yin and one yang; all things follow it.\n\nIn terms of **affairs** (计事, *jìshì*), hardness and strength suffice to overcome softness and weakness. Yet in terms of the **Dao/Way**, softness and weakness suffice to overcome hardness and strength—this is why hardness and strength are the followers of death, while softness and weakness are the followers of life.\n\nHence, when armies are strong, they do not prevail.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** When opposing armies clash, the pitiful will triumph.\n\n**Explanatory notes:** The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is but the end of **virtue/power** (德, *dé*).\n\nThe **Sage** mobilizes **spirit-qi** (精神, *jīngshén*), moves the **heart-methods** (动心术, *dòngxīnshù*), and focuses on the **root** (本, *běn*), from which the **branches** (末, *mò*) follow. Thus, Heaven’s awe is manifest, and the **spirit-martial** (神武, *shénwǔ*) does not resort to killing. This is seen in the **Sage**’s benevolence extending across the world, and righteousness inspiring awe throughout the world. Such an approach is indeed sufficient to uphold the **root** (大定功, *dàdìnggōng*) of great peace, to settle the people and harmonize the multitude, and to attain the constant **Dao/Way** of victory. How could one ever prioritize the strength of armies?\n\nTherefore, those who assist the **Sovereign** (人主, *rénzhǔ*) with the **Dao/Way** do not rely on making armies strong throughout the world.\n\nYet when opposing armies clash, the pitiful triumph—this is because they hold victory well.\n\nWhen wood is strong, it is split.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The sturdy branches of *gōngbǎ* (拱把) mulberry and *zǐ* (梓) trees—people all know to cultivate them, yet when they become strong, they are cut down and split.\n\n**Explanatory notes:** The *Shijing* says: *\"The chairs are made of mulberry and zǐ wood.\"*\n\nIndeed, mulberry and zǐ wood are gentle and refined materials, fit for ceremonial and musical use. When they first grow, they are but small branches, and people, if they wish to cultivate them, all know to nurture them because of their softness and weakness.\n\nYet when they rest day and night and are nourished by rain and dew, and can serve as the beams of halls or as tools and implements, then they are cut down and split—because of their hardness and strength.\n\nLooking at plants, even they are felled first when strong, so how can one doubt that hardness and strength are the followers of death?\n\nThus, hardness and strength occupy the lower position, while softness and weakness occupy the higher.\n\n**Emperor Huizong’s annotation:** The victory of softness over hardness, and of weakness over strength, is the **Dao/Way** and **art** (道术, *dàoshù*) of the **Master Lao**.\n\n*Zhuāngzǐ* says: *\"To display meekness and weakness, and to practice humility and submission.\"*\n\n**Explanatory notes:** Softness is the **Dao/Way**’s hardness, so the constant **Dao/Way** of victory lies in softness. Weakness is the **Dao/Way**’s strength, so the constant **Dao/Way** of defeat lies in hardness.\n\nFor softness accumulates into hardness, and the accumulation occurs first.\nWeakness accumulates into strength, and the formation occurs later.\n\nThe first is above, the latter is below. Hardness and strength are naturally above, while softness and weakness are naturally below.\n\nObserving this in Heaven and Earth, Heaven accumulates **qi** (气, *qì*), fulfilling its role in generating life and occupying the upper position—its accumulation is not hardness and strength. Earth accumulates masses (块, *kuài*), fulfilling its role in bearing form and occupying the lower position—its accumulation is not softness and weakness.\n\nObserving this in the principles of things, water’s nature is to follow: if directed east, it flows east; if directed west, it flows west. Yet in attacking hardness and strength, it cannot overcome them. Wind, when it points at me, overcomes me; when it blows against me, it also overcomes me. Yet it alone can break down great trees—this is because it accumulates the unyielding force of countless small victories into a great victory.\n\nThus, the victor is above, and the vanquished are below.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** and **art** (道术, *dàoshù*) of **Master Lao** are often found in this principle: hardness leads to ruin, sharpness leads to blunting. Hence, one knows to be male yet preserve the female, to be bright yet embrace the dark. While others always take the lead, the Sage alone takes the rear, never leading yet always following others. This can be called attaining the constant **Dao/Way** of victory.\n\nObserving his writings, the discussions on softness overcoming hardness are numerous: some say \"preserve softness,\" others say \"attain softness,\" yet again, \"do not dare to seize strength.\" Furthermore, \"the overbearing will not attain their death,\" and in this passage, the principle of strength and weakness is elaborately expounded.",

      "translated_text": "Zhuangzi said that to display meekness and humility as a facade is not the Dao/Way of dwelling below. Once, Confucius, when questioned by Zilu, spoke of strength and said, *\"Be broad and gentle in teaching, but do not answer the unrighteous strength of the southern lands.\"* Could this too be the Dao/Way of preserving softness?\n\nWho says that Master Lao’s teachings and Confucius’ Dao do not align?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seventh: The Dao/Way of Heaven**\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?\n\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised; the overabundant are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: The Dao/Way knows no gain or loss, but things have fullness and emptiness. It is poured into yet never overflows, measured yet never exhausted—this is what the Sage preserves.\n\nWhen descending into things, Heaven and Earth fill and empty with the times, waxing and waning. How much more so for humanity?\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven attains perfection in balance, thus lowering the high so they do not exceed, raising the low so they do not fall short. Those who are about to come are advanced, those who have succeeded are withdrawn. The four seasons run their course, each in its proper order.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: The Dao/Way in the world is vast, encompassing all boundaries, yet subtle, penetrating to the core. Its use fills the six voids, yet when abandoned, none know its whereabouts—what gain or loss is there? When descending from the Dao/Way, it is confined by things, bound by *qi*, and transformed by *qi*’s fluctuations; it adheres to numbers and is governed by them. One fullness, one emptiness—none can escape this.\n\nOnly the Dao/Way transcends *qi* and numbers, becoming the mystery of all things. Thus, those with *qi* and numbers all draw from it without depletion. Hence, it is poured into yet never overflows; though added to, it does not increase. It is measured yet never exhausted; though diminished, it is not diminished further. The more it gives to others, the more one retains; the more it bestows, the more one possesses. This is what the Sage preserves—what humanity cannot abandon.\n\nMoreover, within the realm, vast as Heaven and Earth are, when the Dipper shifts south, all things flourish; when it shifts north, all things wither. It wanes as it wanes, flourishes as it flourishes—sometimes waning, sometimes flourishing, moving with the times. Even the Dipper’s single star in the void cannot escape *qi* and numbers.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth fill and empty, waxing and waning with the times. How much more so for humanity? Therefore, rise and decline succeed one another, completion and ruin follow in turn—this is the unalterable principle of nature.\n\nOnly the Dao/Way of Heaven follows reason and balance, thus nothing exists that does not attain the mean. If mountains are steep and barren while marshes grow fat, if waters recede from depths while trees wither their branches, if those who gnaw with teeth lose their horns, if those who flap with wings lose their feet—\n\nThe high fear their arrogance and are lowered to bend and conform, not exceeding to the point of excess. The low fear their meanness and are raised to stand and reach, not falling short. Those who are about to rise are advanced, those who have succeeded withdraw, like the four seasons: spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow. They shift without lingering, each in its proper order, all tending toward the mean.\n\nObserve the Dao/Way of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain—this is the Dao/Way of time.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: The *Yijing* says: *\"The Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes fullness and supplements humility.\"* Those who are full are diminished—this is diminishing the excessive. Those who are humble are supplemented—this is supplementing the deficient. To diminish the excessive and supplement the deficient is to balance through transformation.\n\nThe *Shujing* says: *\"Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain—this is the Dao/Way of time.\"* Could this be what is meant?\n\nBut the Dao/Way of humanity is not so. It diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: Human hearts push down the low and elevate the high, oppressing the solitary and fearing the eminent.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: What arises naturally is the Dao/Way of Heaven. What is forced is the Dao/Way of humanity. The two are vastly distant.\n\nSince the Dao/Way of humanity is burdened by artificiality, human hearts are ever precarious, never at ease. The low are pushed further down, the high are raised further up, chasing after things in deference and subservience, lacking steadfast principle. Thus, they oppress the solitary and fear the eminent.\n\nThe solitary are pitiful—if they are oppressed, none encourage them to cultivate virtue and do good. Who will take their side? The eminent are contemptible—if they are feared, none punish them for deceit and wickedness. Who will restrain them? This is merely diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive—how could they know the natural Dao/Way of Heaven?\n\nWho among humanity can diminish the excessive and serve the deficient in the world? Only the Dao/Way.\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: It does not oppress the solitary, yet the impoverished receive from it. It does not fear the eminent, yet the wealthy are diminished by it. Only those with the Dao/Way can do this.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary: The solitary are rejected and oppressed by the many. If one loves virtue, even if they are solitary and honored, they will be advanced and not oppressed—this is the impoverished receiving from it. The eminent are emulated and feared by the many. If one does not love virtue, even if they are eminent and high, they will be punished and diminished—this is the wealthy being taken from. Truly, this is the Dao/Way.\n\nThe Dao/Way acts impartially, neither favoring one nor neglecting another. It universally responds, fittingly addressing all, balancing the unbalanced to attain balance. The Sage embodies this to govern the world—who would suffer from partiality and deceit?\n\nThus, to diminish the excessive and serve the deficient is not to align with the Dao/Way of Heaven. Who can achieve this?\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"The Master is the Dao/Way of Heaven.\"* Therefore, the Sage acts without relying on it, accomplishes without claiming it—does this not mean they do not desire to be seen as virtuous?\n\nEmperor Huizong’s annotation: They do not rely on their actions, so they have no pride in self-praise.",

      "translated_text": "The Sage thus speaks: *\"To bear a state’s defilements is called the sovereign of the ancestral altars; to bear a state’s misfortunes is called the king of all under Heaven.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Rivers and marshes receive filth, mountains and thickets harbor disease; a ruler contains defilements, embodying the Dao’s emptiness, and thus what he receives is ever broader, becoming the refuge of all things, while his governance extends ever farther.\"*\n\nThe Classic says: *\"To know its glory and endure its humiliation is to be the valley of all under Heaven.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *\"Water begins as a single ladle, yet accumulates to form rivers; thus the Yangtze and Yellow River gather waters to become vast. Earth begins as a single clod, yet accumulates to form fields; thus hills and mountains rise from lowly heaps to become lofty. When good deeds accumulate to form virtue, the divine clarity is naturally attained; the Sage’s heart flows accordingly, and so the great person harmonizes all to become the public good. What the *Classic of Transmission* says—‘Rivers and marshes receive filth, mountains and thickets harbor disease, a ruler contains defilements’—is precisely this.\n\nThough a ruler’s undertakings may bring prosperity, his ascent to kingship is marked by the burden of what others flee. Hence, a king’s virtue lies in his capacity to receive. To be the king of all under Heaven, one must hold fullness without excess, preserve completion without loss—this is why one must bear the state’s misfortunes. This aligns with the Classic’s saying: *‘What people detest are solitude, widowhood, and barrenness, yet the king and duke take them as their calling.’*\n\nTo bear a state’s defilements and its misfortunes alike is to view honor and humiliation as one, without the heart of clinging or rejecting. In essence, it is only emptiness that can receive—hence the *Dao De Jing* says: *‘To know its glory and endure its humiliation is to be the valley of all under Heaven.’* This is the ultimate rectitude.\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Words are not confined to one meaning; what seems contrary to things is in harmony with the Dao—this is called the ultimate rectitude of all under Heaven.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *\"How can the Dao exist without words, or words exist without the Dao? One and words are two; two and one become three. From this point onward, even the most cunning cannot grasp it—thus words are not confined to one meaning. Yet, when the ultimate words are spoken, the common words prevail, giving rise to debates like ‘Firm and White’ [over differing interpretations], where people are bewildered and do not know where to turn. Then all under Heaven begins to see ‘rectitude’ as contrary to things.\n\nOnly those who understand the resolution of words—though they seem contrary to things, yet harmonize with the Dao—can speak all day and exhaust the Dao. What could be more ultimate than this rectitude? This is what Zhuangzi meant when he said, *‘Parables are the true words.’*\"\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine: Harmonizing Great Grievances**\n\n*\"To harmonize great grievances\"* must leave lingering resentment—how then can it be called ‘good’?\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Those who seek revenge do not break the spear; even those with vengeful hearts do not resent the windblown tile. Thus there is no lingering resentment.\"*\n\n*\"To love people is the root of harming them. To lay down arms is the root of creating them—how then can it be called ‘good’?\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *\"The spear has no intent to harm, so those who seek revenge do not break it. The windblown tile has no intent to harm, so those with resentful hearts do not resent it. If one is always a judge or executioner, then people’s encounters with them are like the spear or the windblown tile—hence, all under Heaven is balanced, and there is no lingering resentment.\n\nMoreover, benevolence loves people, so it hates those who harm them. Righteousness follows principle, so it hates those who disrupt order. If one uses cleverness to win favor, this is benevolence—yet it is the root of harming people. If one prohibits attacks and puts weapons to rest, this is laying down arms—yet it is the root of creating them. How then can harmonizing great grievances be truly good?\n\nThus the Sage holds only the left contract, and does not demand accountability from people.\"*\n\nThe Emperor Huizong’s annotation states: *\"The Sage follows great transformation without obstruction, receiving and rejoicing in it—hence no demand for accountability from people, nor do people demand it of him. Contracts have left and right, distinguishing giving and taking. To hold the left contract is to give alone.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* [commentary] explains: *\"The Sage empties himself to traverse the world; though myriad appearances are diverse, his heart remains ever clear. Though myriad transformations differ, his heart remains ever still, responding naturally to all under Heaven’s ways. He simply follows this moment, and in emptiness and tranquility, there is nothing to obstruct or muddy. This is what Zhuangzi said: *‘To follow great transformation without obstruction.’*\n\nThus he can float in response, intoxicated by the flow, never rejecting people or severing things, yet suddenly standing in the realm of no affairs. To act without action, to govern without governance, to treat things without harming them—while things cannot harm him—is why he holds only the left contract and does not demand accountability from people, nor do people demand it of him.\n\nIn ancient times, governance was achieved by knotted cords; later sages replaced them with written contracts.

He responds only when moved, always out of necessity, not delight. How could he take pleasure in forcing harmony upon all?\n\nThose who are blind to this cannot establish deep roots through virtue nor set firm boundaries with moderation. They chase after things and forget their own path, failing to find their own fulfillment yet seeking that of others. They labor endlessly, striving only for universal harmony, while harboring both conciliatory and resentful emotions—this is the very essence of obstruction, the *蔽蒙* [blinded and deluded]. Thus, when Zhuangzi says, *'He who finds pleasure in universal harmony is not a Sage,'* is he not correct?\n\nFor obstruction means he cannot see clearly, and delusion means he lacks understanding. Burdened by things and hindered, who could truly diminish substance for harmony or attain emptiness for clarity?\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has no favorites—it always aligns with the good.

      "translated_text": "Huizong’s annotation states: *\"When lands are vast and populations numerous, governance cannot keep pace with demands, wisdom cannot discern all matters, and virtue declines while punishments arise—thus the chaos of later ages begins here.\"* Laozi, at the end of the Zhou, weary of its disorder, sought the original Dao and embedded this intent in his text, aiming to counter the excesses of ornate culture and restore simplicity. Hence, he spoke of *\"small states, few people.\"*\n\nIndeed, in the age of supreme virtue—from Róngchéng to Shénnóng, with twelve sovereigns renowned for perfect governance—this was their very essence.\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains:\n*\"Under Heaven’s vast expanse, all is the king’s land; within its borders, all are the king’s subjects.\"* Yet why, despite such boundless territory, does Laozi advocate for small states and sparse populations? For when lands expand and people multiply, cunning and deceit flourish, tasks proliferate beyond governance, and wisdom, clouded by artifice, fails to discern truth. Moral decay and licentiousness ensue, offenses multiply, and transgressions defy prohibition—thus the root of later disorder.\n\nLaozi, pitying the decay of contemporary customs, traced the origins of virtue and illuminated profound truths. Through his text, he sought to dismantle the superficial and restore the pure simplicity of antiquity, consolidating scattered elements into unity and stripping away ornamentation to reveal substance. Thus, he spoke of *\"small states, few people.\"*\n\nFrom Róngchéng, Dàtíng, to Fúxī, and Shénnóng—twelve sovereigns celebrated for perfect governance—also governed by ensuring the people lacked knowledge and desire. In harmony with ignorance, their virtue remained untainted; in harmony with desirelessness, they embodied pristine simplicity. Such was the age of perfect order.\n\nLaozi’s teachings aimed to return the people to this primordial state, hence his emphasis on this principle. He sought to render the people’s abundant tools useless:\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Unity without factionalism, free from the burdens of crowds.\"*\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary elaborates:\n*\"The people possess innate nature—weaving cloth for garments, tilling fields for sustenance—this is called shared virtue. Since their virtue aligns, they need no external comparisons, and self-sustenance suffices. This is unity without factionalism.\"*\n\nUnity lies in shared nature, while factionalism arises from unnecessary comparisons. When united yet uncompared, they dissolve into the boundless, and the people, until death, do not interact. Even with abundant tools, they find no use for them—how much less the burden of crowds?\n\nThus, the Sage detests crowds, for crowds breed factionalism. Shun, though thrice relocating to Chengdu, settled at Deng’s ruins with ten thousand households, yet his joy in governance knew no end. When crowds gathered, he welcomed them—Shun could not refuse. Yet such responses were but responses to dust and dross, the remnants of imperial affairs. To wield the world yet remain detached, achieving effortless governance—who but the most divine could do so?\n\nHe made death precious, so the people did not flee.\n\nHuizong’s annotation: *\"Life brings them joy, death offers burial—thus the people do not lightly abandon their land.\"*\n\nConfucius said: *\"When the ruler loses the Way, the people scatter—long has this been so.\"* Is this not the meaning of fleeing?\n\nThe *Cushui* commentary explains:\n*\"The people’s greatest concern is to live and die without regret. If life brings joy—honoring parents and nurturing offspring with provision—if death offers burial—garments, coffins, and grave goods are assured—then where is the delight in life or the sorrow in death? How could they lightly abandon their land for distant shores?\"*\n\nIn Zhou’s heyday, the six provisions sustained the people, ensuring the poor were relieved, and the six customs secured them, guaranteeing ancestral burial. Five clans aided in mutual assistance, four neighborhoods shared funeral rites. Plowing together in fields, dwelling in shared quarters, laboring in common enterprises, defending against shared harms—thus the people did not lightly abandon their land. How much more so in a virtuous realm, where the people are simple and unspoiled, private desires few, and cravings scarce! With no paths through mountains, no bridges across marshes, how could they lightly abandon their land for distant shores?\n\nYet gathering them posed no difficulty: love them, and they grow close; benefit them, and they assemble. Govern through what they hate, and they disperse. The reason ancient peoples valued life and did not flee was that their rulers upheld the Way, loving and benefiting them.\n\nConfucius said: *\"When the ruler loses the Way, the people scatter—long has this been so.\"* Thus, if the people do not flee, it is because the Way is upheld.

      "translated_text": "Huizong’s annotation states: *\"Mountains without paths or tunnels, marshes without boats or bridges—this is akin to the people having no knowledge, yet their virtue remains unbroken. Without traces of perilous obstacles, even if chariots and boats exist, they serve no purpose to ride upon; without signs of warfare, even if arms and armor are present, they serve no purpose to deploy.\"*\n\nThe *Shu yi* commentary explains: *\"Beyond natural inclinations, there is nothing but material things. When these things become one’s companions, then external pursuits become one’s primary concern. Cravings and calculations multiply, and the people wander and flee without end. If one seeks to draw them far away, then mountains must be carved with paths and tunnels to make passage possible; if one seeks to traverse difficulties, then marshes must be bridged with boats and ferries to be navigated. Even if one wishes to rest and leave no trace, it cannot be achieved. Only in an age of supreme virtue do the people return to their original nature: mountains lack paths or tunnels, marshes lack boats or bridges, yet they do not travel between one another. Their ignorance is like that of infants—dwelling without knowing what to do, moving without knowing where to go. Simple and tranquil, they leave no record of perilous obstacles, so even if chariots and boats exist, they serve no purpose to ride upon. Forgetting distinctions and judgments, they know no signs of warfare, so even if arms and armor are present, they serve no purpose to deploy. Thus, each finds contentment in their natural endowments alone.*\n\n*If one were to restore the use of knotted cords for governance, Huizong’s annotation says: *\"It is merely a record of essentials, requiring no written contracts.\"* The *Shu yi* commentary elaborates: *\"The governance of the world must have some means to preserve and transmit enduring clarity for future generations. Thus, in the upper antiquity, knotted cords were used to rule, while later sages replaced them with written contracts, saying that words alone cannot fully record all matters, so they are verified by written texts; deeds alone cannot fully establish trust, so they are supplemented by seals. But when governance reaches its peak of effortless action, when the people are pure and affairs are simple, then bonds need not be enforced with glue or ropes. People act in accordance without needing to be bound by rules—even if knotted cords were used to record essentials, it would suffice to win the trust of the world. Why then require the meticulous detail of written contracts and seals to prevent deceit among the people? Thus, restoring the use of knotted cords is to return the people to the age of primordial simplicity.*\n\n*They find their food sweet, their clothing fine, their customs settled, and their occupations joyful. Huizong’s annotation explains: *\"They till the fields to eat, weave to clothe themselves, carry food in their mouths while playing, and drum their bellies in leisure—these are the people’s natural capacities. They are content with their portion, so their food is sweet; they reject ornamentation, so their clothing is fine; they are undisturbed, so their customs are settled; they preserve life, so their occupations are joyful.\"*\n\n*The *Shu yi* commentary further clarifies: *\"When the people return to their original nature, they abandon superficiality and focus on the essentials, spurning useless labor and valuing only practical matters. Their livelihood depends solely on farming and sericulture. Thus, when they till the fields to eat, the grain is unified under cultivation; when they weave to clothe themselves, the silk is unified under spinning. They rise with the sun and rest with the setting of it, with no need for cleverness or skill—only daily sustenance matters, so they carry food in their mouths while playing. Harm and benefit do not unsettle them; they simply adapt to their own ease, so they drum their bellies in leisure. The people’s essential tasks are fulfilled here, and beyond these four matters—sweet food, fine clothing, settled customs, and joyful occupation—there are no further concerns. Sweet food lies in moderation, not in aversion to eating; fine clothing lies in simplicity, not in adornment. Settled customs come from non-interference, free from reckless action. Joyful occupation lies in self-sufficiency, without covetous desires. Without the people returning to their original nature, how could this state be attained?*\n\n*Even neighboring nations gaze upon one another, and the sounds of chickens and dogs intermingle, yet the people live to old age and death without ever visiting one another. Huizong’s annotation says: *\"Their dwellings are close, their voices heard, yet they do not travel between one another. At that time, there were no cravings or desires, no artificial actions—only constant spontaneity. This is what is called supreme virtue.\"*\n\n*The *Shu yi* commentary elaborates: *\"Their dwellings are close, yet their paths are not marked by interaction. Their voices are heard, yet their places are distant in spirit. It is fitting that they protect and aid one another, share resources and welcome guests. But even when they reach a state of serene forgetfulness, living to old age and death without ever traveling between one another, it is because they do not know the distinctions that govern interaction—thus, there is no interaction at all. Though mountains lack paths and marshes lack bridges, it is so. When their nature returns to simplicity and desire vanishes, their hearts forget material things and seek nothing—only constant spontaneity. What else could this be but supreme virtue?\"*\n\n*Laozi, in the chapter on ‘The Supreme Ultimate,’ says: *\"The people say of me that I am effortless.\"* Indeed, having already spoken of the governance of the Supreme Ultimate as effortless, it is clear that in an age of supreme virtue, the people act without artificial means yet remain constantly spontaneous. There is no doubt of this.\n\n*The chapter on ‘Faithful Words Are Not Beautiful’ (81):*\n*\"Faithful words are not beautiful,*",

      "translated_text": "「The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"When the Dao emerges in speech, it is bland to the point of tastelessness, yet it does not shame even the hundred sages nor decay through the ten thousand ages.\"*\n\n*The Commentary explains: *\"The Dao is not mere words; without words, its profundity cannot be revealed. Words are not the Dao; without the Dao, their foundation cannot be established. When the Dao manifests in words, it is bland yet without taste, rooted in principle and meaning—far beyond the sweetness of coarse grains and the beauty of rich delicacies. It can be practiced to verify truth and examined to resolve doubts. When combined, it aligns like matching seals; when upright, it is easy to follow. Thus, it does not shame even the hundred sages. When firm as metal and stone, it is essential yet easy to uphold. Thus, it endures through the ten thousand ages without flaw. If so, then faithful words grounded in the Dao—what need is there for them to be beautiful? Beautiful words lack faithfulness.\"*\n\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"‘Proper speech’ is ornate; those who indulge in elaborate rhetoric use mere embellishments as their core, thus lacking faithfulness.\"*\n\n*The Commentary explains: *\"Ornate speech lacks substance; what lacks substance is merely empty. Thus, ornate speech is empty, while profound speech is real. Indulging in elaborate rhetoric leads to words that fail to convey truth, using mere embellishments as their core, thus failing to grasp the essence. If such is the case, then the farther one strays from the Dao. Though the end may still be called ‘speech’ and the Dao may be exhausted, it is enough to please those who seek beauty in sound—yet where is the substance to demonstrate faithfulness? Thus, it lacks faithfulness.\"*\n\n*\"The good do not argue,*\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"Speech should emphasize essence and principle.\"*\n\n*The Commentary explains: *\"When one attains completeness, it is called ‘essence’; when all essences converge, it is called ‘principle.’ Speech that upholds essence and principle as its standard achieves the fullness of the Dao and contributes to ultimate truth. When such speech is established, it is always appropriate. Though it does not rely on elaborate argumentation, its profound meaning is fully preserved—enough to satisfy what people desire to hear. This is what is meant by ‘the good do not argue.’ Formerly, Confucius examined the Twelve Classics and said: ‘The essence lies in the Seven Meanings.’ Mencius, who followed Confucius, when pressed for words, said: ‘Do I truly enjoy argumentation?’ His words were: ‘I study extensively and explain in detail, only to return to concise speech.’ Yet Yang Xiong said: ‘The essence of speech is conciseness.’ Is this not the meaning of ‘the good do not argue’? Argumentation is not good.\"*\n\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"Excessive elaboration leads to many digressions, straying from the Dao’s ultimate correctness.\"*\n\n*The Commentary explains: *\"Excessive speech exhausts itself; it is better to uphold the middle. Indeed, the labor of argumentation is like that of a mosquito—far from the Dao’s ultimate correctness. As for Gongsun Long’s sophistry and Hui Shi’s manifold schemes, it is merely the toil of a mosquito. This is why argumentation is not good.\"*\n\n*\"The wise are not learned,*\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"To grasp the subtleties of the Dao, one must return to its simplicity.\"*\n\n*The Commentary explains: *\"The Dao’s simplicity does not complicate; those who know its subtleties understand it in a single word, preserving it in direct perception. A little suffices—why seek learning? The Classic says: ‘What is learned yet unnamed is called subtlety.’ Exploring subtlety reveals its formless, hidden nature. Only when one returns to simplicity and speaks to the extreme can this be known. Zhuangzi says: ‘Knowledge of it is shallow; ignorance of its depth is profound.’ The learned do not know. The Emperor Huizong annotates: ‘What is heard and seen is less valuable than simplicity.’ Zhuangzi says: ‘Learning is not necessary for knowledge; argumentation is not necessary for wisdom.’ The Commentary explains: ‘When studying the Dao, one must daily diminish. The Dao’s formless realm is perceived only by the spirit, its soundless expanse only by the qi. Vision and hearing do not depend on the ears and eyes—why value the multitude of what is heard and seen? The good progressors of the Dao say: ‘Uphold simplicity’ and ‘speak concisely.’ Indeed, ‘it is better to uphold simplicity.’ Laozi, in response to Confucius’ inquiry about the ultimate Dao, also said: ‘The learned do not know; the argumentative are not wise.’ Thus, the subtleties of knowing the Dao are not attained through mere learning and observation—this is clear.\"*\n\n*\"The Sage has no accumulation,*\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"There is accumulation; thus, it is insufficient. There is no hoarding; thus, there is abundance.\"*\n\n*Zhuangzi says: *\"The Dao of the Sage flows without accumulation.\"*\n\n*Confucius says: *\"I thus daily depart.\"*\n\n*The Commentary explains: *\"The Dao’s ultimate emptiness has never contained anything. Things are boundless, all confined within the Dao. The Dao is obscure in its nothingness, thus empty yet responsive; things are stagnant in their existence, yet how much do they differ? Like grass in its growth, it is taken as if it would never end, yet when gathered, it is sometimes exhausted. This is accumulation—thus, it is insufficient. But emptiness without accumulation is different. Like a mirror reflecting forms, all beauty and ugliness are revealed; like a valley echoing sounds, all goodness and evil are answered. This is why there is no hoarding, yet there is abundance. The Sage embodies the Dao’s ultimate emptiness, flowing without accumulation. Six senses and four limbs—there is nothing the Sage is not present in. Responding in time, it is merely the remnants of the Dao, never obstructing reality. Thus, the Sage can manifest in transformation and stand alone in heaven. Zhuangzi, in his discussion of the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of the Emperor, and the Dao of the Sage, all said: ‘It flows without accumulation.’ This is the case. Confucius attained this Dao, reaching boundless freedom and leaving no trace. It was not merely received and preserved—his form did not change until its end. Thus, he said: ‘I thus daily depart.’ Though he has departed, how could he be lost in mere emptiness and stillness, preventing students from entering his gate? He simply does not cling to traces of existence, offering them instead to forget in nothingness. Though he forgets the past ‘I,’ there is an ‘I’ that does not forget. Giving to others, he becomes ever more abundant; sharing with others, he becomes ever more plentiful.\"*\n\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates: *\"The good are generous and complete, yet never exhausted. All things borrow from them without depletion.\"*",

There is no doubt of this.\n\n*The chapter on ‘Faithful Words Are Not Beautiful’ (81):*\n*\"Faithful words are not beautiful,*",

      "translated_text": "The *Explanatory Commentary* states: The Dao reaches the utmost non-being, yet fulfills all things’ demands. It is poured into without overflowing, drawn from without exhaustion, and suffices all things without ever being depleted. All things flourishing between Heaven and Earth, their growth and formation—all draw from it without depletion, for it moves yet never accumulates.\n\nThe Sage attains the Dao, yet never hoards it for himself. Giving to others, he becomes ever more abundant; sharing with others, he ever more plentiful. Responding to the myriad needs from the foundation of emptiness and stillness, his embrace is boundless and all-encompassing, taking as needed and always sufficient—how could it not be amply abundant?\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming.\n\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates:* *\"Only the *Qian* [Creative] can benefit all under Heaven with its beauty. Though it does not speak of what it benefits, all things are truly benefited, and there is never any harm.\"*\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states: *Qian* is the Dao of Heaven. Great indeed is the primal *Qian*! All things draw their origin from it. Its transformative mechanism subtly shifts within the boundless void—it opens and gives birth, extends and circulates, and through this, all things are formed. All precious treasures flourish in the grand assembly of *Heng* [Abundance] and *Jia* [Auspiciousness], none but the beauty of benefiting all under Heaven.\n\nThe *Odes* sing of abundant harvests, saying: *\"Much millet, much glutinous rice.\"* For millet thrives in high, dry, and cold places, while glutinous rice favors low, moist, and hot conditions. Speaking of them as \"much\" reveals Heaven’s beneficence knows no limits—though it does not name what it benefits, the benefit is inherent.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"Heaven and Earth possess great beauty, yet do not speak of their beneficence.\"* How then could there be any harm?\n\nThe Sage’s Dao acts yet does not contend.\n\n*The Emperor Huizong annotates:*\n*\"It follows without opposing; its motion is like water.\nIt responds without hoarding; its stillness is like a mirror.\nIt harmonizes without leading; its response is like an echo.\nThough it acts, its action arises from non-action—it embodies Heaven itself. What contention could there be?\"*\n\nThis virtue aligns with the Dao, hence the *Classic of Virtue* concludes with it.\n\nThe *Explanatory Commentary* states: The Sage applies the Dao to all under Heaven, nurturing things according to their nature, aiding their spontaneous unfolding. Thus, it follows without opposing, its motion like water—what is called *\"timely action.\"* Supplying all demands, it effortlessly transforms from non-being to being; responding without hoarding, its stillness is like a *yín* [balance scale]—what is called *\"steadfast stillness.\"* Attending to things’ responses, gentle and still in itself, it harmonizes without initiating—its response is like an echo—what is called *\"preserving the feminine.\"* These three aspects, within oneself without attachment, let things manifest naturally. It is neither non-action nor action, but non-action that encompasses all action.\n\nThough establishing myriad laws, its action stems from non-action. Abandoning cleverness and fixed ways, it follows Heaven’s natural order.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is a single *qi* in motion, all things flourishing in abundance. It acts without effort yet remains ever clear, conquers without contention. The Sage embodies Heaven to govern the world, playing with the Creator—its Dao is subtle yet vast, in motion weaving the myriad realms, in stillness mirroring Heaven and Earth. Universally responsive yet never at odds, thus it acts without contending. This virtue aligns with the Dao, hence the *Classic of Virtue* concludes with it.\n\nLaozi, in concluding the *Classic of Virtue*, speaks of aligning with the Dao, for the Dao in others is called *dao*, while the Dao within is called *de*. Virtue encompasses the unity of the Dao; only when virtue advances beyond the Dao can one speak of its utmost expression. When Dao and virtue reach this state, is not the intent of the *Classic* profound?\n\nI have often reflected: Though the Dao is unspeakable and hidden, it is not as clear as when spoken. Laozi, pitying the excess of rhetoric in his time, sought to restore the purity of Heaven and Earth and the essence of antiquity. To return to the primal simplicity, he composed ninety-nine chapters, elucidating the intent of Dao and virtue to awaken all under Heaven and future generations. He spoke only when necessary, hence in the final passage, he explains his purpose in writing the *Classic*: *\"Faithful words are not ornate; eloquent speakers are not virtuous,\"* urging students to delve beyond the words to grasp their mystery, transcending speech itself.\n\nLike Zhuangzi’s *Book* concluding with the *Heaven Down*, it delves deeply into the origin of the Great Dao, forcefully rejecting the obfuscations of a hundred schools. He himself claimed his writing was \"erratic and absurd,\" loosening the traces of his composition.\n\nExamining the *Zhuzi*, none surpass Zhuangzi in wisdom to comprehend Laozi. Their works complement each other—how could it be merely a matter of verbal artistry?\n\nTracing his critique of the Six Classics, they reduce to the *Odes’* aspirations, the *Documents’* deeds, the *Rites’* practices, the *Music’* harmony, and the *Changes’* yin-yang, along with the *Spring and Autumn’*s distinctions of rank—hardly confined to pedantic commentary. Thus, the truly wise are not merely erudite.\n\nYet when discussing the varied excellences of myriad arts—from Mozi downward to Huishi’s multifarious schemes—his *Five Cartloads* of writings are contradictory and inconsistent, ever more distant from the Dao. This reveals that extensive knowledge without insight is blind.\n\nSpeaking of the Sage’s non-accumulation through emptiness, it is clear that giving to others increases his abundance, sharing with others multiplies his plenty.\n\nObserving the Sage nurture all things and harmonize the world, he must take Heaven as his standard, demonstrating the Dao’s beneficence without harm.\n\nObserving the establishment of the ever-present non-being, it must be expressed through gentle, weak, humble, and lowly conduct, revealing the Sage’s Dao acts without contending.\n\nThough Laozi and Zhuangzi’s words differ, their Dao resonates without explicit agreement. Examining their concluding intent, this is the true grasp. Respectfully submitted.\n\n*The Explanatory Commentary on the Authentic Classic of Dao and Virtue* concludes here, Volume Fourteen.",
