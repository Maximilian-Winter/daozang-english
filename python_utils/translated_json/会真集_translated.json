  "full_translation": "**The *Huizhen Collection***\n\n**Title:** *Huizhen Collection*. Composed by Wang Jichang, styled Chaoran. Five fascicles. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**Preface to the *Huizhen Collection***\n\nThe *Book of Changes* is vast and boundless, formless in its essence. It begins with the singular *qi*—this is the Dao. The *Changes* embodies three principles: the unchanging, the mutable, and the simple.\n\nThe unchanging is that which stands alone and never alters. The mutable is the succession of the four seasons. The simple is the effortless order of heaven and earth.\n\nThe six lines of a hexagram: the inner trigram is called \"purity,\" the fixed structure of heaven, earth, and humanity as the Three Powers. When doubled, it is called \"regret,\" for fortune and misfortune, regret and humiliation arise from movement.\n\nThe lower two lines represent earth, the middle two humanity, and the upper two heaven. The top and bottom positions hold no rank. The second and fifth lines are discussed in terms of human affairs, hence the phrases \"the dragon appears\" and \"the dragon soars,\" and \"it is beneficial to see the great person.\" The third and fourth lines occupy the positions of heaven and earth and are not called \"dragons.\" When addressed in human terms as the \"noble person,\" this reflects the resonance between heaven and humanity.\n\n*Qian* and *Kun* are the virtues of heaven and earth. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, they give birth to three sons and three daughters, governing the Five Agents—these are the Five Phases, acting on behalf of heaven and earth. Later, the sixty-four hexagrams emerged, distributing 384 lines across a year, roughly corresponding to the cycles of years, months, seasons, days, and hours, with twelve hexagrams changing each day.\n\nHumankind is the spirit of the myriad things, its nature and destiny complete, one in body with heaven and earth. Only the sagely know the sagely; the benevolent see it as benevolence, the wise see it as wisdom. Those who can harmonize and direct it within themselves are called cultivators of the Dao.\n\nLater scholars divided teachings into three, regarding the *Book of Changes* as the \"true mystery,\" the *Laozi* as the \"void mystery,\" and the *Zhuangzi* as the \"discursive mystery.\" Though their explanations differ, they converge in mystery, beyond the grasp of ordinary people—only immortals can fathom it.\n\nLast spring, at the Qingyi Pure Spirit Abbey, I met Master Wang Jichang, styled Chaoranzi. In conversation, his words flowed like pearls and jade, his breath like mist and clouds, as he expounded the three mysteries. Alas, our parting came too swiftly. Like a pair of wild ducks flying west, time passed in the blink of an eye, and I have not forgotten him day or night.\n\nNow, two immortal youths have arrived at Yunxi, and I rushed out to greet them, sandals askew. One is the reincarnation of Liang Zhen of the Tang, the other a scion of the southern Liang—both old friends. I invited them to the honored seat, and over tea, they mentioned their teacher Chaoranzi’s work, the *Huizhen Collection*, wishing to carve blocks and disseminate it widely. They asked this old rustic to write a preface.\n\nFrom his sleeve, he produced the text. From beginning to end, I perused its words, recalling our conversation of last year. Examining its diagrams, poems, and songs, all sprang from his heart and mind—shaping the altar, revolving the wheel, harmonizing the great cosmos, forging the Primordial within his innermost being. He clarifies the ages of the seven, eight, nine, and six, and the generation and completion of water, fire, wood, metal, and earth.\n\nThis is what Prince Wang Zijian meant by \"inverting the Five Phases and shifting the Eight Trigrams.\" Who but an immortal could achieve this? If it spreads throughout the world, seekers of the Dao will be like those holding a torch in a dark room.\n\nI admire the two immortal youths for propagating their teacher’s excellence—they have not forgotten their roots. Thus, I dare not refuse their request and have briefly set forth these facts at the beginning of the scroll.\n\nPreface by Yang Zhipu, the Leisurely Old Man of Wei’s Southern Yunxi.\n\n**Fascicle One of the *Huizhen Collection***\n**[Diagrams and Explanations of the Symbolism and Numerology of the *Zhouyi*]**\n**The Supreme Ultimate**\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate is the designation of the Limitless, yet it cannot be named. Its qi, form, and substance remain undifferentiated in primordial chaos. Within it reside the fifty-five numbers, containing the Two Modes, Three Luminaries, Four Images, and Five Phases—all complete yet without form. This is what the *Laozi* refers to as \"a thing chaotically formed.\" The *Jade Inscription* states: \"Before the separation of the Dark and Yellow, the qi’s appearance was dim and obscure.\" How can those who study the Dao fail to know the origin of the singular qi, the ancestor of the myriad things?\n\nThe numbers generate the Five Phases:\nWater: one (☰ Qian, Jia)\n\nOnce the Five Ultimates were divided and the Two Modes first separated, the Four Images then subtly arose, and the Five Phases secretly took form. Within them, the qi’s hues shifted and transformed, their shapes and images becoming distinct. After a million years of dim obscurity, the qi turned black. Black corresponds to the image of Water, whose generative number is one. One is the beginning of the Qian’s origin, the root of the Eight Trigrams, and gives rise to Jia. Jia is the first of the Five Phases and the origin of the ten celestial stems. Thus, in this primordial era, the sages observed its celestial patterns and inscribed the heavenly tally, recording the celestial patterns. Later, worthy successors reverently upheld this, marking the celestial origin and establishing the calendar through the arrangement of lines. From that time onward, the reckoning of years and seasons spread and became manifest.\n\nFire: two\n\nThe black qi transformed again after a million years, turning crimson. Crimson corresponds to the image of Fire, whose generative number is two. Two is the beginning of the Xun trigram and gives rise to Xin.\n\nWood: three\nAfter a million years, the crimson qi turned verdant. Verdant corresponds to the image of Wood, whose generative number is three. Three is the beginning of the Gen trigram and gives rise to Bing.\n\nMetal: four\nAfter another million years, the verdant qi transformed into white. White corresponds to the image of Metal, whose generative number is four. Four is the beginning of the Kun trigram and gives rise to Gui.\n\nEarth: five\nAfter a million years, the white qi turned yellow. Yellow corresponds to the image of Earth, whose generative number is five. Five is the beginning of the Li trigram and gives rise to Ji.\n\nThe Completion Numbers of the Five Phases\nFrom the generative numbers to the completion numbers of the Five Phases: the odd numbers one, three, and five sum to the yang nine, governed by Jia and Bing, serving as the guest. As the central five of Earth (Li Ji) combines with Jia and the Water of one, it reaches the completion number six, descending to generate Kun Yi, thus moving first as the guest. The even numbers two and four sum to the yin six, governed by Xin and Gui, serving as the host. Further, the five of Earth added to the Fire of two reaches the completion number seven, ascending to generate Zhen Geng. Yi and Geng unite, exchanging north and south, thus moving later as the host. Water (one) and Fire (two) with Earth sum to ten, generating Kan Wu. Fire’s generative number (Xun Xin) follows Earth’s Ji to combine with Wood’s three (Gen Bing), reaching the completion number eight and generating Dui Ding. Water’s generative number (Qian Jia) also joins the central Earth’s five with Metal’s four (Kun Gui), reaching the completion number nine and generating Qian Ren. Ding and Ren unite, exchanging east and west. Thus, the transformations of two earths and three heavens are set in motion, reckoning the yang nine and yin six in generation and completion, revolving the stems and branches, distinguishing the soaring and hidden, and incorporating the Jia. With two ascending and one descending, water and fire are drawn and replenished; three are illuminated while four are concealed, and wood and metal interchange. Hence, the primordial Dao disperses as the foundation of the myriad transformations, its wondrous workings manifesting in the descent of a thousand spirits. How can those who cultivate the truth not delve into the origins of yin and yang?\n\nFire: six\nFrom the five of Earth added to the Water of one, reaching the completion number six, generating Kun Yi.\n\nFire: seven\nFrom the five of Earth added to the Fire of two, reaching the completion number seven, generating Zhen Geng.\n\nWood: eight\nFrom the five of Earth added to the Wood of three, reaching the completion number eight, generating Dui Ding.\n\nMetal: nine\nFrom the five of Earth added to the Metal of four, reaching the completion number nine, generating Qian Ren.\n\nEarth: ten\nFrom the five of Earth added to the five of Earth, reaching the completion number ten, generating Kan Wu. Thus, the Eight Trigrams are complete, and the ten celestial stems are fully arrayed. They blend and merge, the mother embracing the child’s womb, the child concealed within the mother’s body, yet to be distinguished.\n\nInterchange to Form Ten\nAs Qian and Kun pair, their completion numbers are fulfilled. Yang descends and yin ascends, floating and sinking, reversing and intertwining; rotating left and right, connecting above and below, the five positions interact, each finding its union. One and nine form ten: Ren and Jia meet, Qian pairs with Kun to generate Kan, which conceals Jia and Yi. Four and six form ten: Yi and Gui shift together, Kun pairs with Qian to generate Dui, which conceals Gui and Ren.\n\nInterchange to Form Ten\nThree and seven form ten: Geng and Bing meet, Qian pairs with Kun to generate Zhen, which conceals Bing and Ding. Two and eight form ten: Ding and Xin meet, Kun pairs with Qian to generate Li, which conceals Geng and Xin.\n\nEarth’s Image Self-Unites\nKan Wu: Li incorporates Ji to obtain five, Kan incorporates Wu to obtain ten, together summing to fifteen. This number attains the mean of heaven and earth, its position occupying the center of heaven and earth, thus requiring no pairing but uniting itself.\n\nThe Four Images Generate the Eight Trigrams\nFrom the Two Modes arise the Four Images. Within the Four Images, Kan’s completion number is six; its original trigram retains three, with three external numbers generating Qian, incorporating Ren but not Gui, as Qian and Kun pair and Gui is incorporated into Kun. Dui’s completion number is nine; its original trigram retains three, with six external numbers generating Kun, incorporating Yi but not Jia, as Kun and Qian unite and Jia is incorporated into Qian. Li’s completion number is seven; its original trigram retains three, with four external numbers generating Xun, incorporating Xin but not Geng, as Zhen and Xun interact and Geng is incorporated into Zhen. Zhen’s completion number is eight; its original trigram retains three, with five external numbers generating Gen, incorporating Bing but not Ding, as Gen and Dui interact and Ding is incorporated into Dui. Thus, the Five Phases are inverted and defined, their mutual transformations and changes clearly distinguished. The Eight Trigrams take form, their structures manifest and evident.\n\nThe middle son produces the old yang: Metal emerges from within Water. The youngest daughter gives birth to the old yin: Earth arises from within Metal. Only Wood is born of Fire, the middle daughter descending as Xun Xin. And Earth is born of Wood, the eldest son emerging as Gen Bing. From this, we discern the firmness and yielding, movement and stillness of Qian and Kun; the stirring and moistening of Zhen and Xun, wind and thunder; the meeting and separation of Bing and Ding at the corners; the clear divisions of soaring and hidden, shifting palaces. With the completion numbers established, the body reverses and cycles, the hun-soul transforms and roams, concealment and manifestation return to their origin, ascent and descent gather their traces. The eight celestial stems above undergo three positional shifts. Wu and Ji, formless and solitary, govern the four directions yet lack pairing. Ji, as yin, is incorporated into the middle daughter Li; Wu, as yang, is incorporated into the middle son Kan. Thus, the ten celestial stems are complete, their numbers forming odd and even, revealing the transformations of a single moment, the union of movement and stillness with the true. This fully expresses the Dao of observing heaven and mastering its movements. Those who cultivate the truth should diligently study the line texts, clearly follow the trigram structures, seize the ascent and descent of yin and yang above and below, and thoroughly explore the ebb and flow of generation and completion. With focused and inwardly refined intent, they will fathom the ceaseless changes of each day. When no regrets arise within the crucible, the purest qi descends, gold and mercury congeal into form, and the divine elixir is swiftly achieved—clear as the palm of one’s hand.\n\nThe Essentials of Stem Conjunction and the Return of the Eight Trigrams\n\nThe ten celestial stems and eight trigrams embody the five phases and four images, generating transformations and giving rise to completion. They divide north and south, east and west, then return and interchange. Within them, Kan and Li serve as gates and portals, while Qian and Kun act as the pivot and vessel of the crucible. They propel the union of yin and yang, dispatching the two qi to race forth. With each descent and ascent, the stem spirits shift position; through the convergence of the Two Modes and Three Unions, the trigram images submit to their origin.\n\nThose who study the Dao must embody heaven and earth’s transformative workings and drive the sun and moon to share the same palace. With each inhalation and exhalation, a single celestial cycle is completed; with each gathering and dispersion, life and destiny are determined. As Laozi said: *\"The gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of heaven and earth.\"*\n\nWhen the yang tally is to move, Kun pursues Qian, emerging from the left; when yin holds authority, Qian follows Kun, responding from the right. Their ceaseless coming and going aligns with the principle of stem conjunction and trigram correspondence.\n\nThe formula states: Through exhalation, the number seven is formed—Li as fire, where true water descends within. Ji unites with Jia, and Jia, rejoicing, ascends, flying into the divine palace. Through inhalation, the number six is formed—Kan as water, where true fire rises within. Wu unites with Gui, and Gui, delighted, descends into the elixir chamber. Ding and Ren conjoin, returning to Li and Ji, like mountains and marshes exchanging qi, phoenix dancing and crow soaring. Yi and Geng gaze longingly, turning to Kan and Wu, like wind and thunder clashing, hare glowing and toad shining.\n\nThus, the four images return to the golden crucible, and the five phases gather into the jade furnace. Bing and Xin manifest, meeting Qian and Kun, uniting with Wu and Ji, and circulating the ten stems to return to the origin. When gathered, they are like grasping ten fingers; when dispersed, each reverts to its proper place.\n\n**Upright**　　　　　　**Inverted**\n\nThe inversion of the five phases is thus: Kan as water generates metal, producing Qian-metal, which conceals Jia and Yi, with flying and latent wood, its phase of growth beginning in Hai. Dui as metal generates earth, producing Kun-earth, which conceals Ren and Gui, with flying and latent water, its phase of growth beginning in Shen. Li as fire generates wood, producing Xun-wood, which conceals Geng and Xin, with flying and latent metal, its phase of growth beginning in Si. Zhen as wood generates earth, producing Gen-earth, which conceals Ding and Bing, with flying and latent fire, its phase of growth beginning in Yin.\n\nAs for Wu and Ji, they alone govern the center, flourishing in all four seasons, lodged in the southwest Kun-earth—the place where earth is most vigorous, its phase of growth beginning in Shen. This is called: with exhalation, the yang stems move in sequence; with inhalation, the yin stems reverse their course. Yin and yang, reversing and advancing, gather and disperse, concealed within the completion numbers. The completion numbers are the dynamic qi of the celestial origin.\n\n**Five Phases**　　　　　　**Stems Conjoin**\n\nWhen heaven and earth first divided, yin and yang separated into their positions. Heaven distributed the five qi, and earth arrayed the five phases. The five phases established their positions, governing the four directions; the five qi branched forth, scattering into the ten stems. The stem spirits shift their positions, pairing and generating one another, their forms and images distinctly manifesting their unions, deriving from the celestial origin’s five qi to become the true five phases.\n\nAll who cultivate the Dao must first thoroughly investigate the mechanism of stem-wheel interchange, then comprehend the images of their generative unions—this is the foundation for binding essence and life, the basis for the great elixir of transformation. When the root is established, the great Dao arises.\n\n**Jia-Ji True Earth**\nGui generates the wood spirits Jia and Yi in the east—water generating wood, with Wu as Jia’s father. The central yin-earth Ji is given to Jia as wife, and Jia-Ji unite to form true earth.\n\n**Yi-Geng True Metal**\nJi generates the metal spirits Geng and Xin in the west—earth generating metal, with Jia as Geng’s father. The eastern yin-wood Yi is given to Geng as wife, and Yi-Geng unite to form true metal.\n\n**Bing-Xin True Water**\nYi generates the fire spirits Bing and Ding in the south—wood generating fire, with Geng as Bing’s father. The western yin-metal Xin is given to Bing as wife, and Bing-Xin unite to form true water.\n\n**Ding-Ren True Wood**\nXin generates the water spirits Ren and Gui in the north—metal generating water, with Bing as Ren’s father. The southern yin-fire Ding is given to Ren as wife, and Ding-Ren unite to form true wood.\n\n**Wu-Gui True Fire**\nDing generates the earth spirits Wu and Ji in the center—fire generating earth, with Ren as Wu’s father. The northern yin-water Gui is given to Wu as wife, and Wu-Gui unite to form true fire.\n\nRevealed thus for application, cycling without end.\n\n**Wood and Metal Interspersed**\nThose who study the Dao must probe the root of essence and life, fathom the origin of transformation, discern the cause of wood and metal’s interspersion, clarify the principles of water and fire’s extraction and supplementation, grasp yin and yang’s manifest and latent states, and understand the floating and sinking of hun and po.\n\nThe interspersion of metal within wood: wood is yang-hun, embodied in the eastern Zhen trigram, which receives Geng as Kun’s eldest son—a single yang with two yins, thus yang-hun. It should ascend, but with two yins suppressing one yang, it cannot rise. In the human five viscera, this is the liver, submerged beneath lung-metal. The liver contains Geng-metal’s interspersion: though the liver’s true nature desires to float upward, Geng, as yin-po, steals the yang-hun, preventing its ascent and keeping it below. If one seizes the mysterious mechanism, circulating the fire tally of the celestial cycle for a thousand days without error, refining away the Geng-po within the liver, the liver returns to its ancestral nature, pure and unadulterated, and naturally ascends.\n\nLeng Ranzi asked: \"What in the liver is metal?\"\nAnswer: \"When the liver is born and enters water, it sinks—what sinks is metal. Wood and metal intermingle, its color becoming purple. Purple is metal. Thus it sinks below. When met with fire’s refining, it matures, the liver floats above, its color turning green, called *returning to the origin*. It regains its original nature, and the hun-spirit congeals, undisturbed.\"\n\nThe interspersion of wood within metal: metal conceals yin-po, belonging to the west, embodied in the Dui trigram. It should sink, yet instead floats—why? Dui is Qian’s youngest daughter, one yin with two yangs. The single yin cannot suppress the two yangs, so it floats above. Dui is Geng-metal; Yi and Geng unite, the wife following the husband’s chamber, with metal as the host. Metal is the lungs, but Yi-wood floats it, so metal lies above water. If one seizes the fire tally of the celestial cycle, refining for a thousand days without error, refining away the wood within the lungs, it becomes unadulterated, revealing metal’s original body, and naturally sinks.\n\nLeng Ranzi asked: \"What in the lungs is wood?\"\nAnswer: \"When the lungs are born, their color is red, but white is wood. Thus they float in water. When met with fire’s refining and matured, the lungs sink below, their color turning purple, returning to the true po of their original nature, settled and prolonging life.\"\n\n**Metal and Wood in Fire: Discerning Host and Guest**\nWhen metal and wood intermingle, fire restores their original natures. One must remove metal from wood and wood from metal. Since both are refined together, why is metal alone removed from wood while wood remains, and wood alone removed from metal while metal remains?\n\nRemoving metal from wood: wood has its original form as host, while metal, hidden within, is a floating guest in color. When refined by fire, the guest departs first, preserving the host. Removing wood from metal: metal has its rigid body as host, while wood within is soft and a guest. When refined by fire, the host remains while the guest departs.\n\nIn all who cultivate the true Dao, one must clarify the causes of refining metal and wood, thoroughly investigate the principles of host and guest in their preservation or loss, rely on the fire’s timing without error, and follow the measures for withdrawing and adding lead and mercury. Then, without waiting for days, the elixir will naturally form.\n\nMaster Pingshu notes: Nurturing the elixir without fire is like a mother holding a dead fetus—prolonged effort yields no result, only futile labor. How is this different in principle from metal and wood, which only reveal their natures when refined by fire?\n\n**Water and Fire: Attainment and Non-Attainment**\nThe natures of water and fire mutually contain and gestate one another. Within water there is fire, and within fire there is water. What is meant by \"within water there is fire\"? Water belongs to the northern *Kan* trigram, embracing yang within yin. That water can reflect objects is the true fire. In the human body’s five viscera, water corresponds to the kidneys, which store essence—essence being fire.\n\nWhat is meant by \"within fire there is water\"? Fire belongs to the southern *Li* trigram, embracing yin within yang. The blackness at the heart of fire is the true water. In the five viscera, fire corresponds to the heart, which governs blood—blood being water.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"When water is above fire, it is *jiji* (attainment); when fire is above water, it is *weiji* (non-attainment).\" Master Pingshu notes: \"Within water, three fires gather; within fire, water refines and steams.\" All who cultivate the Dao rely on method and image to harmonize yin and yang, mastering the subtle transformations of the key and lock, causing water and fire to ascend and descend. By adding and withdrawing in accord with *jiji* and *weiji*, lead and mercury naturally congeal within the crucible, and the elixir forms—then golden light fills the chamber.\n\n**Water and Fire Ascend and Descend Through Earth**\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Water flows toward the moist; fire tends toward the dry.\" Without awareness, they respond to one another, revealing the principle of nature. Yet water is said to moisten and descend, fire to flame and ascend. How then, in *jiji*, does water remain above while fire stays below? Within *Kan* water there is fire because *Kan* receives *wu* (yang), which is pure and becomes essence, transforming into clear yang qi that ascends to become true water. Within *Li* fire there is water because *Li* receives *ji* (yin), which is turbid and becomes blood, transforming into heavy turbid qi that descends to become true fire.\n\nWater and fire are the true qi of Heaven’s origin, born from the spleen. The spirit of the spleen governs creation alone, residing at the center, revolving the four directions, ascending and descending with each breath. When the qi of Heaven’s origin moves, one breath contains five—subtly aligning with the five phases.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Heaven’s number is five; Earth’s number is six\"—the central number of yin and yang. This central number refers to earth. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving from beginning to end. Green, red, white, and black each occupy a direction, while the central palace receives the work of *wu* and *ji*.\" Master Pingshu also says: \"The four images and five phases all rely on earth.\" Without the central qi of *wu* and *ji* circulating between *Kan* and *Li*, the divine elixir will never be produced.\n\n**The Qi of Kan and Li Transform and Return to the Origin**\nWithin the heart, mercury is concealed; within the kidneys, lead is hidden. How are these two substances to be employed? Through the inverted technique of the five phases, true fire transforms into divine water, lead and mercury become wandering souls, and breath rises with the wind—naturally accomplishing the work of creation.\n\nWhen the qi of Heaven’s origin stirs in the kidneys, *Kan*’s *wu* is yang, and one exhalation moves five. When the qi of Earth’s origin stirs in the heart, *Li*’s *ji* is yin, and one inhalation moves five. The movement of yin and yang qi combines to make ten. The *Book of Changes* states: \"Heaven is nine; Earth is ten\"—*wu* and *ji* naturally unite.\n\nDrawing mercury from the heart transforms it into essence; ascending lead from the kidneys transforms it into qi. Essence and qi become things and change, naturally coagulating into the *daogui*. When mercury is drawn from the heart, true water descends, and the *Li* trigram sheds its yin to become the *Qian* body. *Qian* is Heaven—light and clear, without yin. Those who align with this naturally extinguish the seven emotions and melt the six desires like ice.\n\nWhen lead ascends from the kidneys, true fire rises, and the *Kan* trigram sheds its yang to become the *Kun* image. *Kun* is Earth—heavy and turbid, without yang. Those who align with this naturally gather the three into a circle, and the myriad conditions of the heart dissolve.\n\nDevotees of the Dao, take heed of these words.\n\nI have heard Guangchengzi say: \"Above the celestial pivot, the qi of Heaven’s origin governs; below the celestial pivot, the qi of Earth’s origin governs; at the celestial pivot, the source of yin and yang follows.\" Those who cultivate the Dao model their forms on Heaven and Earth. The head is round like Heaven, the root of clear yang, revolving the seven luminaries, responding to the movement of the pivot, assisting the Purple Tenuity and the Valley of Emptiness, with the primordial spirit encircling it.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"Imitate the way the seven luminaries revolve in emptiness—seizing yang to refine yin.\" *Tan* and *Ju* correspond to the two ears. They assist the numinous terrace, preventing the dust of the world from staining it, the myriad conditions from clinging to it, so that the spirit’s awareness becomes still and settled.\n\n*Lu* and *Wen* correspond to the two eyes. If they are opened, the spirit scatters outward; if closed, the spirit settles within. *Lian* and *Wu* connect the path of the assisting ministers, piercing the Gate of the Mysterious Female—the root of Heaven and Earth, the key to nature and life. Exchanging them in due time, continuously as if present, the five spirits interact, and the elixir furnace’s fire blazes.\n\n*Pojun* guards the Metal Pass, sealing the Earth’s gate, fanning the true wind within, so that water qi cannot assail. It secures the golden womb, preventing leakage, and the essence of the red dragon causes the Three Corpses to flee. With the heart cold and the six bandits trembling in fear, fire burns the golden crucible, water overflows the Jade Pass, and the original qi of the entire body flows through the three fields above and below.\n\nThe eight trigrams of the body: *Li* is the Crimson Palace, the meeting place of *jia* and *si*, the land where tiger and dragon transform and arise—the dwelling of the ten thousand spirits.\n\nThe *Kan* trigram conceals the Two Mysteries, gathering the Five Phases, harmonizing the Four Images; essence and light converge, *wu* and *gui* return to their root—this is called the Palace of the Great One.\n\nThe *ding* of the lungs stores the *po*; undisturbed by fright, it remains at peace. The *geng* of the liver conceals the *hun*; free from joy and anger, it abides in stillness. *Ren* and *jia* govern the large intestine, transmitting the Dao; *xun* and *xin* adhere to the gallbladder’s nature, maintaining central harmony. The *kun* earth forms the Winding River, reversing and returning yin and yang; the *gen* mountain pours forth the water source, generating pure and vast primordial *qi*. These are the functions of the Seven Governors and Eight Trigrams—the root and stem of yin and yang, the alchemy of the golden elixir, whose wonders cannot be measured.\n\nAs the *Yinfu Jing* states: \"When the Seven Governors achieve success, the yellow sprout grows within; when the Eight Trigrams encircle, the divine light dims and fades.\" The *Xici* of the *Yijing* says: \"The sage establishes images to fully express meaning, sets forth trigrams to fully convey the essence.\"\n\n*Huizhen Ji*, Scroll One concludes\n*Huizhen Ji*, Scroll Two\nBy Chaoranzi Wang

the hundred bones, the nine orifices’ gates open,\nAbove and below, flowing and ascending in mutual succession.\nThe work extends through the three heavens and two earths,\nThe nine sixes of yin communicate, the seven eights of yang stand firm.\nDescending and ascending qi bow,\nAdvancing creation, the precious vessel is woven.\nMatching hardness and softness in unity,\nDrawing and adding in accord with number,\nNurturing the single grain of spirit-elixir.\nThe yang soul transforms, the dharma-realm expands,\nStriding swiftly upon the clouds.\n\n**Auspicious Crane Immortal: The Completion Numbers’ Creation of the Golden Elixir**\nThe golden elixir’s true creation,\nIn advancing the fire, the work of drawing and adding refines.\nContinuous breath wholly relies upon it,\nMatching heaven’s gate and earth’s axis,\nBorrowing the crucible’s form.\nLead dissolves, mercury pours,\nDrawing the colorful phoenix and golden crow to descend.\nEntering the Yellow Court, revolving in mutual exchange,\nDescending and ascending, the two natures welcome and receive.\nThe moon goddess, with ample leisure, offers wine,\nAmidst clustered reed pipes and flutes,\nJoyfully connecting day and night.\nThe immortal youths exert their strength,\nRiding the void, dancing upon colored clouds.\nToward the depths of the three heavens,\nReleasing the heart’s intent,\nThe five-colored radiance shines intensely.\nSurely the jade flask’s ninefold gold is perfected,\nIts value beyond estimation.\n\n**Also: Refining the Elixir to Completion’s Number.**\n\nAdvancing water and fire, extracting and adding at the six yang moments.\nThe majestic tiger and dragon unfold,\nRolling pure winds across the earth,\nThe two natures unite in essence.\nThunder resounds through the cosmos,\nSteeping jade buds as sacred mushrooms sprout in splendor.\nAwait the crucible’s fire to cool and ice to congeal—\nOnly then is the snow-like flesh perfected.\nThe body abounds with fragrance, musk and orchid,\nWithin, golden light radiates,\nBright as day in the night.\nVirtue flourishes in emptiness,\nManifesting purity,\nTruly without flaw.\nAll forms and void dissolve,\nThe spirit refined, the soul sanctified,\nPenetrating the profound depths of earth and the vastness of heaven.\nAmidst the wondrous selection of the Three Clarities,\nAlready vying for leadership.\n\n*Playing with Sand by the Stream · Drinking the Knife’s Measure*\nRising and sinking between Li and Kan, qi remains unconfused,\nAt heaven’s gate, breath diminishes as one drinks the knife’s measure,\nFlying past the moon palace to the sun’s crow.\nIn the northeast, companions arise, harmonizing the jade hare,\nThe two natures’ harmonious qi exhales rainbow hues.\nThe fire-refined jujube is carried by the youthful attendant.\n\n*Again*\nDiligently drinking the knife’s measure to refine utmost yang,\nThe steaming medicinal aroma permeates heaven’s fragrance,\nInstantly spraying sweet dew, the soul-returning nectar.\nDrinking to radiant intoxication, ever drunk through long days,\nWhirling and dancing in time with reed pipes and flutes,\nIn blissful joy, ascending to heaven’s realm.\n\nThe triple-eight forms the knife’s breath, lingering slow,\nThe *gui* relies on *wu-ji*’s inhalation and exhalation to refine.\nFlying and concealing, the ten stems attest to added growth.\nWhen creation congeals the immortal elixir’s body,\nConsume it in due time to ascend in spirit-flight—\nBeyond the sun’s flight, one attains carefree wandering.\n\n*Again*\nWith each breath, the medicinal aroma deepens,\nThe five spirits stir, stirring golden sand from the sea.\nThe immortal of the Celestial River ferries the sacred raft.\nWater fills the golden city, congealing cold dew,\nMan and ox vanish, the moon shines empty splendor—\nA pure wind bears one homeward in laughter.\n\n*Ten Thousand Springtimes*\nJade lock and golden pass exchange seals and closures—\n\nJade lock and golden pass,\nYin and yang strike the watchman’s clapper, firmly sealed.\nMutually congealing, they restrain.\nTransforming without attachment,\nThe belly brims with fine, cool wind.\nIn the nine qi of heaven,\nClouds tread without the slightest veil.\nThe root and stem of Dao,\nSilently harmonizing,\nPervade the three realms in clarity.\n\n*Again*\nA single qi of harmonious surge,\nThe heart-ape tightly locked, unable to flee.\nTamed and softened, it receives—\nThe pass is sealed in secrecy,\nGuarded by the Great One’s misty embrace.\nWhen the two merge,\nSilent and dim, they endure long—\nForming the odd and even,\nRefinement must reach nine nines.\nThen one enjoys the boundless longevity of emptiness.\n\n*Again*\nVast qi flows and circulates,\nContinuously cradling true *chan* stillness.\nNurturing the spirit, it rises—\nProfound and obscure, hard to awaken,\nCongealing the mysterious and yellow to gestate.\nCreation’s round emptiness,\nPolishes the spirit-terrace to translucence.\nEver responsive,\nThe wood-child’s form excels,\nStepping steadily along the cloud-radiance path.\n\n*Slow Tune of the River Spirit: True Sitting*\nCultivating truth amidst ten thousand entanglements,\nThe mind’s ground demands fierce effort.\nNurturing the foolish and clumsy,\nReleasing the four great elements,\nOne rests at ease, untroubled.\nWill like iron—\nVigorously severing the horse and ape, breaking both legs,\nCeasing all waywardness, gathering all into quiescence.\nThe eight passes, six viscera, and three palaces,\nAll harmonized and smooth,\nThe ten thousand spirits rejoice.\nTortoise-breath, mysterious and unbroken,\nAttains limpid stillness—mother and child,\nRound and conjoined.\nThe two natures merge—\nRevealing the yang body,\nRefined to the moment of flight.\nThe mind, ice-pure,\nCreation’s true emptiness returns beyond things,\nThe effortless Dao, perfectly complete, yet seeming incomplete.\nReleasing the nature-moon’s radiance,\nIt pierces through heaven and earth.\n\n*Slow Tune of the River Spirit: False Sitting*\nThe valley spirit dies, unaroused,\nBurrowed in delusion, the heart errs in its merit.\nFutilely chiseling,\nSeeking the mysterious and wondrous,\nRelying on the water and grain’s cloud-root.\nWasted effort—\nTwisting and contorting the body, constantly grasping,\nFocusing intently, the earthly pass lacks lock and key.\nThe heavenly gate remains unbroken, tightly sealed,\nHow could qi linger between being and non-being?\nThe three palaces’ ascent and descent are hindered,\nClinging to one nature, losing the returned,\nThe dregs of the Western advent.\nDao’s essence thins—\nThe soul and spirit stray,\nIn motion and stillness, dragon and tiger coil.\nIgnorant of the sacred key,\nHow can one refine the jade crucible’s golden water?\nWithout the elixir’s body,\nHow could one tread the clouds in joy?\nIf by chance the mysterious mechanism becomes clear,\nOne may meet the Penglai covenant.\n\n*No Mundane Thoughts: Qi Deviance*\nOne breath, one sigh,\nIgnoring the valley spirit, the mysterious female’s continuity falters.\nHurried gathering and scattering defy creation,\nRoot and stem hang precariously, far removed.\nNo return above or below,\nComing and going lose control,\nNot directed toward the three palaces.\nInternally lost, seeking the superior,\nThe mind clings to one fixed point.\nExternally flooding the four limbs and skin,\nFloating and scattered, restless,\nClumsily unsettled.\nBeholding the body’s many tremors,\nTransforming a thousandfold—how could it be otherwise?\nThe mind not reduced to cold ashes,\nThe form not withered like deadwood,\nLife and nature diverge like cloud and mud.\nChan’s power stagnates—\nHow could one achieve the pure yang body?\n\n*Plum Blossoms by the River: Qi Deviance Returned to Right*\nA vast qi stirs in the Primordial Palace,\nAligning with refined cultivation, moving the pure wind.\nPiercing the three passes,\nNaturally filling above and below.\nThe victorious external wanderings are drawn inward,\nAll in one finger’s span,\nGathered into the jade path’s midst.\nThe spirit welcomes the celestial valley, proud in the clear sky,\nNurturing harmony and fusion, attaining free flow.\nThe body, unentangled, becomes limpid—\nProfound stillness verifies the *Can Tong Qi*.\nSelf and other both forgotten, truly expansive,\nThe principle of non-action,\nPerfectly complete,\nReveals sacred merit.\n\n*Plum Blossoms by the River: Spirit Deviance*\nThe four limbs’ qi scatters, losing root and sprout—\nBecoming spirit deviance, emitting empty flowers.\nA thousand strange phenomena,\nBefore the eyes, chaotic as hemp.\nAll sages and worthies appear at will,\nTransforming endlessly,\nAll due to a single thought’s deviation.\nUnaware of the heart’s illness, still boasting,\nScenes boundless, affairs deemed fine.\nSpecially obscuring the mysterious and unobstructed,\nThe Dao-eye veiled by dust.\nNot practicing true *chan*, one falls into demonic realms—\nYin and yang sundered,\nSee how one refines the cinnabar sand.\n\n*Plum Blossoms by the River: Spirit Deviance Returned to Right*\nThe numinous breast, washed clean of dust and filth,\nThe illusory form hollowed, the outer guise foolish.\nIn the tranquil and indifferent realm,\nOne gallops, delighting in Dao’s essence.\nA single qi restrains the spirit, the spirit intoxicated,\nRiding drunkenness in dance,\nGolden lads and jade maidens lend support.\nThe mysterious mechanism’s true creation demands diligent effort—\nShedding the mortal frame,\nEntering emptiness.\nExpansive and luminous,\nThe nature-moon, solitary and round.\nColdly immersed in *chan*’s heaven, wind and mist still,\nThe ice-flesh’s radiance,\nProud and limpid,\nShines like a jade flask.\n\n*Again*\nScenery forgotten, passions extinguished, ten thousand entanglements sparse,\nGazing and cleansing, Dao’s essence unfurls.\nGrasping the origin,\nSpirit and breath move slowly.\nNurturing the spirit-terrace, still as a mountain,\nEver silent,\nRegulating the spirit, with surplus to spare.\nThe forest of true realms, proud in *Huaxu*,\nRevealing the primordial beginning,\nWondrously thus.\nFormless, majestic,\nThe appearance aligns with emptiness.\nDancing and frolicking, unobstructed,\nSinging wildly,\nRejoicing unrestrained,\nLike *Jieyu*.\n\n*Again*\nTen thousand slants do not mar the solitary spirit’s wonder—\nThe wondrous appearance aligns with emptiness.\nThe sea of awakening, vast and boundless,\nShines uniquely, surpassing the black pearl.\nClouds still, water cold, without the slightest veil,\nThe pure body,\nPierces mountains and walls with ease.\nIn the wild, no one—proud as a pair of wild ducks,\nStriding the heavenly thoroughfare,\nPlaying in the immortal capital.\nA single point of round clarity,\nUnrestrained by transformation.\nThe belly, full of harmonious surge, cradles fine jade,\nSecretly stored in the treasury,\nNo longer seeking,\nTo sell at a good price.\n\n*Immortal in the Moon: Guest and Host Exchange*\nSeeking the wondrous, cultivating truth,\nDividing the primordial spirit as guest,\nA single qi as host.\nThe mysterious mechanism unobscured,\nRelying on Kan and Li’s essence,\nBalancing the three and five.\n\nThe vast qi shapes creation,\nDissolving the corpse’s poise, pure Yang coalesces.\nThe sevenfold return of true Yin descends,\nWork complete, traces gathered,\nReturning to recognize the primal ancestor.\nRefining spirit to merge with the Dao in profound obscurity,\nOnly then does the true emptiness reveal its form.\nThe real mark is hard to behold.\nBoundless transformations,\nManifest the luminous pearl of nature at will,\nRadiating expansive light.\nAlone transcending beyond the three realms,\nCommanding purity to soar across past and present.\nReversing guest to host,\nFirst elevating the ultimate merit of universal virtue.\n\n---\n\nThe resolute scholar delves into the origin,\nDiscerning the floating and sinking, movement and stillness,\nDistinguishing essence and function.\nSpirit, initially a guest in form,\nRelies on the misty qi as host,\nTimely uplifted.\nAt the staff’s tip, sun and moon are borne,\nTurning heaven and earth, shifting the qi’s flow.\nThe Northern Dipper and Southern Stars revolve,\nTheir brilliance illuminating the grotto-heaven,\nDeep within, the Wood Lad rejoices.\nNow the host wields sole authority,\nWitnessing Yang’s extremity returning,\nYin descending in its season.\nTrue work molds creation,\nRevealing the original body’s state,\nIts clear radiance pure as ice.\nResplendent, without a speck of defilement,\nResounding through the three realms,\nPermeating the ten directions.\nIn utter oneness, transformed into the formless,\nNeither empty nor existent, beyond birth and extinction.\n\n---\n\n*Wu Ling Chun: The Desire Realm*\n\nIn the Desire Realm, the Valley Spirit first divides,\nPassions dissolved in harmonious fusion.\nGreat Unity’s clouds rise, earth-enveloping winds,\nPeak-topped rains, mist-laden.\n\nCreation’s Yin and Yang ascend and descend in accord,\nThe eight vessels flow with sweet spring’s nectar.\nZither tones, resonant and clear, stir the ears’ wisdom,\nUtter stillness brews wondrous work.\n\n---\n\nOne qi first parts from primordial chaos,\nAwaiting the eight trigrams and nine palaces.\nWithin the crucible, Kan and Li unite,\nTheir subtle movements swelling through the flesh.\n\nTurning the celestial pivot, spirit settles in stillness,\nDragon and Tiger harmonize with metal and wood.\nNature pervades the three palaces, creation’s marvel,\nSilently entering the formless.\n\n---\n\nDesires suddenly forgotten, passions unindulged,\nAbandoning cunning, the Dao nurtures form.\nWhen heart and trace converge, half-drunk, half-sober,\nMother and child gather in the Yellow Court.\n\nNine qi in heaven resound with jade-like tones,\nDay and night unceasing.\nThe immortal lad is ushered into the boundless,\nTransforming, displaying mighty spirit.\n\n---\n\nWhen the heart delights in limpid stillness,\nYin within embraces Yang’s essence.\nA rustling, harmonious wind rises from the sea’s depths,\nFilling the six viscera and nine palaces.\n\nOne qi stirs, the Big Dipper turns,\nThe Celestial Valley welcomes the supreme spirit.\nAll thoughts dissolved, pure virtue perfected,\nA mere footstep scorns the roc’s path.\n\n---\n\n*Yong Yu Le: The Form Realm*\n\nHeart’s concerns congeal to ash,\nWondrous perfection, virtue complete,\nDignity flawless.\nProfoundly serene in meditation,\nObscurely veiled by form,\nWithin the crucible, windscape revealed.\nClouds and mist come and go,\nTiger and Dragon chant and roar,\nDelighting the Wood Lad’s spirit.\nExpanding the chest, deeply drinking harmonious qi,\nUnfettered, drunk in the season of chanting.\n\n---\n\nPipes and songs boil like cauldrons,\nStartling phoenixes dance,\nFreely traversing in ranks.\nAll eyes filled with auspicious light,\nThe sky brimming with propitious mist,\nFaintly drifting red snow.\nClapping the breast, ice gleams,\nFilling the lapel, the moon chills,\nVigorously coursing with the Dao’s luminous clarity.\nProud in the true realm,\nTrue joy, true awe,\nTranscendent wonder unmatched.\n\n---\n\nThe mechanism moves alone,\nYet still bound by form,\nDignified, spirit upright.\nAll leaks sealed,\nAll entanglements severed,\nThe heart’s mirror opened, vast and clear.\nThe meditation barrier shattered,\nDeeply entering the crucible’s spring,\nMyriad forms encircle the seven luminaries.\nThe Milky Way turns,\nLight from the Moon’s Grotto flies,\nLow against the azure sky, reflecting.\n\n---\n\nPure Yang binds the body,\nAuspicious clouds, high repose,\nA light, crisp wind brushes the face.\nJoy unbounded,\nTransformations beyond measure,\nAt times, wild songs and chants.\nPipes and reeds swirl,\nThunder’s drums resound,\nThe Wood Lad plays in surplus blessing.\nIn profound obscurity,\nWitnessing a single point of perfect emptiness,\nUtmost purity, utmost clarity.\n\n**Long Thought of the Immortal**\n\nIn the formless realm, life returns to emptiness,\nNature returns to emptiness.\nObject and self both forgotten, the wind of wisdom unfurls,\nIn profound obscurity, all merges as one.\n\nExerting spiritual work, uniting with primordial chaos,\nThe pristine radiance of spirit shines amid heaven and earth.\nThe formless body flows freely everywhere.\n\n---\n\nThe mind settled, awareness stilled,\nHost and guest dwell together in profound tranquility.\nNeither ox nor man is seen in form.\nThe true nature is numinous, the image is numinous,\nIn movement and stillness, non-doing merges with the boundless dark.\nPerfect emptiness pervades above and below.\n\n---\n\n**Immortal of the Yellow Crane Grotto – Stubborn Emptiness**\n\nDeeply stained by the illness of stubborn emptiness,\nUnknowing of the true mandate of cultivation.\nIn vain, one remains blind to the transformations of yin and yang,\nThe true heart’s mirror shrouded in dense obscurity.\n\nSevering thoughts to perceive the nature—\nThis is but sinking into hollow purity.\nWithout refining the elixir to perfect the wondrous body,\nOne shall never, even after long ages, return to sagehood.\n\n---\n\nThe root of life and nature is profound,\nThe Dao’s foundation lies in yin and yang’s creation.\nTo cling solely to the purity of a single point of spirit’s light\nIs to nearly lose sight of heaven’s Way.\n\nThe Three Thieves must be deeply investigated,\nThe Four Images must be inversely examined.\nSeizing the power of heaven and earth’s transformations,\nOne crystallizes the treasure of perfect clarity.\n\n---\n\n**A Sprig of Plum Blossoms – Severing Emptiness**\n\nSeizing the fire’s timing of the celestial cycle,\nThe elixir furnace burns day and night,\nSimmering mercury, refining lead.\nFrom the sea’s depths and riverbanks, qi billows like smoke,\nDay after day surging, penetrating the Three Fields.\n\nFailing to awaken, one sinks into the trance of profound meditation—\nSpirit scatters, qi disperses,\nMother and child cannot unite.\nYin and yang lose their union, the mystery obscured.\nFor nine years and three, the crucible’s heaven remains unseen.\n\n---\n\nA single qi ascends, the precious tripod seethes,\nWater and fire intermingle,\nLead flies along the jade path.\nYet without spirit’s steadfastness, the two cannot merge as one,\nSeparated as if by clouds and mud,\nThe profound mystery remains unattainable.\n\nIt is essential to still the heart and sever the myriad entanglements,\nThen nature and life naturally blend, returning to Chan.\nThe yang soul transforms, freely ascending,\nIn a hundred days and a thousand mornings,\nCloud-stepping into the crucible’s heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Gazing at the Tide – True Emptiness**\n\nTrue emptiness is the root and foundation,\nWholly reliant on spirit and breath,\nDifferentiating the essence of the Five Aggregates.\nHarmonizing the six spirits, suffusing the Three Isles,\nThe Milky Way’s waves surge with the numinous raft.\nThe Qian tripod simmers cinnabar,\nAs clouds bear the Kun ox,\nAnd the wind conveys the ram-drawn chariot.\nSecretly circulating the Yellow Gold Well,\nForming resplendence, crystallizing jade-like blossoms.\n\nThe most wondrous livelihood flourishes,\nManifesting the principle in perfect emptiness,\nWith a profound vision unmarred.\nPure and undivided, the One True,\nPenetrating heaven and earth,\nVast and unhindered, without obstruction.\nThe square inch of the heart encompasses river sands.\nFreely delighting in wind and moon,\nIntoxicated, reclining amid mist and rosy clouds.\nWithin this, the true message is imparted—\nBestowed solely upon the family of Daoists.\n\n---\n\nForm and spirit both wondrous,\nSpirit unobstructed, transcendent,\nSolemnly independent in profound mystery.\nRevealing principle, simplifying emotions,\nEmptiness and form without barrier,\nUnveiling the ultimate cause.\nThe ancestral intent is secretly transmitted in emptiness.\nAs the mind’s realm and all phenomena dissolve,\nWisdom’s understanding is entirely dispelled.\nA single stretch of true purity,\nExpanding the spirit’s transformation,\nEmerging from Kun and Qian.\n\nThe wondrous body of vast emptiness is perfected,\nManifesting thusness without image,\nLoftily proud in the heavens of Chan.\nResplendent wisdom’s light,\nMajestic true reality,\nThe boundless Dharma realm of the myriad phenomena.\nUniting with the Dao, one wields mighty power,\nHaving shattered the void,\nEven kalpas’ force cannot refine.\nShattering the shell of rebirth,\nEmbracing the True One,\nTranscending the flow of years.\n\n---\n\n**Laozi’s Chant – Three Thousand Merits**\n\nPurifying the spirit, seizing the phoenix’s marrow,\nCessation of breath gathers the crow’s blood.\nSix yangs soar through the cosmos,\nFive qi penetrate the joints.\nClouds, thunder, wind, and lightning strike,\nToward the Three Heavens,\nDescending ice and snow.\nJade mountains and sea peaks spew crimson mist,\nResplendent as daylight,\nThe nature’s light shines through.\n\nThe two passions unite.\nThe heavens of Chan equalize the transformations of things,\nThe mind writes the script of awe and joy.\nThe yang soul fully embodies creation,\nCalled true merit—\nMerit most wondrous.\nThe three thousand numbers unite without flaw.\nSpirit transcends beyond the realm of things,\nForever departing birth and extinction.\n\n---\n\nA numinous wind permeates the marrow,\nVital qi fills the limbs and joints.\nDrawing and adding from Li and Kan,\nIn movement and stillness, they are arranged in exchange.\nThe tally of the celestial cycle is complete,\nGathering yin and yang,\nQi and spirit conjoin.\nThe Yellow Court’s brocade canopy is fully pregnant with auspice,\nTransforming the yang soul,\nThe sacred land’s heaven is thoroughly penetrated.\n\nIn fine distinction,\nThe three thousand true transformations,\nThe ebb and flow of the mysterious and the yellow are revealed.\nThe nature’s light is without a speck of defilement,\nLuminous as ice,\nSpreading pure snow.\nInstantly transcending the Three Realms in true joy,\nSinging and chanting, wandering the Gardens of Lang,\nThe Dao’s sentiment is supremely pure.\n\n---\n\n**Laozi’s Chant – Eight Hundred Practices**\n\nThe numinous source is without a speck of defilement,\nEver responsive, ever pure.\nYin and yang have ceased their union,\nMother and child rejoice in the same palace.\nEmbracing the True One in emptiness,\nExpanding perfect clarity,\nIlluminating the heart’s mirror.\nEverywhere, enlightenment shatters, returning to extinction,\nThe wondrous function of the Dharma vast and boundless.\n\nPossessing true practice,\nCompassion shapes the Dao’s foundation,\nSorrow and empathy, the heart without contention.\nUniversally bestowing, benefiting all things,\nHolding humility as virtue,\nWielding it as authority.\nPerfecting the eight hundred, the fruit of no-leakage,\nInstantly transcending the cloud steps steadily,\nShedding the mortal to return to sagehood.\n\n---\n\n**Freeing the Heart – Returning to Youth**\n\nEarth, water, fire, wind,\nComposing the Four Great,\nIn the end, aging decays into emptiness.\nLife and death, like the cicada’s molt,\nRely on wondrous work in solemn cultivation.\nUniting with heaven and earth, shifting true creation,\nYin and yang’s movement, matching female and male.\nThe spirit’s embryo splits and judges,\nThe numinous body suffuses in mist,\nLight and healthy, returning to youth.\n\nNurturing thusness to perfection,\nThe mysterious emperor’s message,\nCrafted to emptiness, the Dharma image spiritually penetrates.\nSecretly harboring vast qi,\nExpanding transformations,\nThe body boundless.\nFreely resplendent, in the original form,\nMounting the simurgh and crane, laughing proudly in the heavens.\nUnrestrained and at ease,\nManifesting transcendence from the mortal to the sage,\nA thousand ages of pure wind.\n\n---\n\nA single qi’s mysterious work.\n\nThe Three Marvels’ true creation,\nOriginally jade-like countenance perfected.\nMerging into the treasure vault,\nSecretly harboring the nine-turns’ divine elixir.\nDefying the sun’s form, majestic in true appearance,\nDwelling in the real realm, vast as boundless heaven.\nLet the sun and moon hasten,\nUrging the four elements to gradual decay.\nAll things in their prime cannot endure,\nThe borrowed body easily lost—\nOnly that solitary, icy clarity stands firm.\nVast and sacred transformation,\nSoaring and dancing, freely singing and strumming.\nAccompanied by winds beyond the clouds,\nBright moon in clear sky,\nManifesting myriad hidden and revealed forms.\nReturning to youth, never aging,\nFacing calamities and kalpas,\nThe formless spirit abides in peace.\n\nWithout worldly thoughts, the firing times unbalanced—\nThe celestial cycle’s firing times,\nMust rise and fall, soar and settle,\nWithout error or fault.\nQi ascends, piercing the crimson gates,\nBreaching the nine heavens with searing heat.\nEyes struggle to open,\nUltimately consumed by fire’s disaster,\nSwiftly one must adjust.\nProlonging the years,\nTransforms into demonic realms, sinking into ruin.\nThe six spirits lose control, rampant,\nThe three corpses run wild,\nThe five thieves all turn vicious.\nTo quell the raging flames, return to the jade path,\nDeeply enter the spirit palace, vast and open.\nThe three thieves circulate,\nWater and fire intermingle,\nForging the elixir.\nDriving them back to rectitude,\nAttaining the pure essence of sages and saints.\n\nAutumn in the courtyard—\nPerfect Realization:\nYin and yang fully equipped, the

      "translated_text": "**The *Huizhen Collection***\n\n**Title:** *Huizhen Collection*. Composed by Wang Jichang, styled Chaoran. Five fascicles. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**Preface to the *Huizhen Collection***\n\nThe *Book of Changes* is vast and boundless, formless in its essence. It begins with the singular *qi*—this is the Dao. The *Changes* embodies three principles: the unchanging, the mutable, and the simple.\n\nThe unchanging is that which stands alone and never alters. The mutable is the succession of the four seasons. The simple is the effortless order of heaven and earth.\n\nThe six lines of a hexagram: the inner trigram is called \"purity,\" the fixed structure of heaven, earth, and humanity as the Three Powers. When doubled, it is called \"regret,\" for fortune and misfortune, regret and humiliation arise from movement.\n\nThe lower two lines represent earth, the middle two humanity, and the upper two heaven. The top and bottom positions hold no rank. The second and fifth lines are discussed in terms of human affairs, hence the phrases \"the dragon appears\" and \"the dragon soars,\" and \"it is beneficial to see the great person.\" The third and fourth lines occupy the positions of heaven and earth and are not called \"dragons.\" When addressed in human terms as the \"noble person,\" this reflects the resonance between heaven and humanity.\n\n*Qian* and *Kun* are the virtues of heaven and earth. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, they give birth to three sons and three daughters, governing the Five Agents—these are the Five Phases, acting on behalf of heaven and earth. Later, the sixty-four hexagrams emerged, distributing 384 lines across a year, roughly corresponding to the cycles of years, months, seasons, days, and hours, with twelve hexagrams changing each day.\n\nHumankind is the spirit of the myriad things, its nature and destiny complete, one in body with heaven and earth. Only the sagely know the sagely; the benevolent see it as benevolence, the wise see it as wisdom. Those who can harmonize and direct it within themselves are called cultivators of the Dao.\n\nLater scholars divided teachings into three, regarding the *Book of Changes* as the \"true mystery,\" the *Laozi* as the \"void mystery,\" and the *Zhuangzi* as the \"discursive mystery.\" Though their explanations differ, they converge in mystery, beyond the grasp of ordinary people—only immortals can fathom it.\n\nLast spring, at the Qingyi Pure Spirit Abbey, I met Master Wang Jichang, styled Chaoranzi. In conversation, his words flowed like pearls and jade, his breath like mist and clouds, as he expounded the three mysteries. Alas, our parting came too swiftly. Like a pair of wild ducks flying west, time passed in the blink of an eye, and I have not forgotten him day or night.\n\nNow, two immortal youths have arrived at Yunxi, and I rushed out to greet them, sandals askew. One is the reincarnation of Liang Zhen of the Tang, the other a scion of the southern Liang—both old friends. I invited them to the honored seat, and over tea, they mentioned their teacher Chaoranzi’s work, the *Huizhen Collection*, wishing to carve blocks and disseminate it widely. They asked this old rustic to write a preface.\n\nFrom his sleeve, he produced the text. From beginning to end, I perused its words, recalling our conversation of last year. Examining its diagrams, poems, and songs, all sprang from his heart and mind—shaping the altar, revolving the wheel, harmonizing the great cosmos, forging the Primordial within his innermost being. He clarifies the ages of the seven, eight, nine, and six, and the generation and completion of water, fire, wood, metal, and earth.\n\nThis is what Prince Wang Zijian meant by \"inverting the Five Phases and shifting the Eight Trigrams.\" Who but an immortal could achieve this? If it spreads throughout the world, seekers of the Dao will be like those holding a torch in a dark room.\n\nI admire the two immortal youths for propagating their teacher’s excellence—they have not forgotten their roots. Thus, I dare not refuse their request and have briefly set forth these facts at the beginning of the scroll.\n\nPreface by Yang Zhipu, the Leisurely Old Man of Wei’s Southern Yunxi.\n\n**Fascicle One of the *Huizhen Collection***\n**[Diagrams and Explanations of the Symbolism and Numerology of the *Zhouyi*]**\n**The Supreme Ultimate**",

      "translated_text": "The Supreme Ultimate is the designation of the Limitless, yet it cannot be named. Its qi, form, and substance remain undifferentiated in primordial chaos. Within it reside the fifty-five numbers, containing the Two Modes, Three Luminaries, Four Images, and Five Phases—all complete yet without form. This is what the *Laozi* refers to as \"a thing chaotically formed.\" The *Jade Inscription* states: \"Before the separation of the Dark and Yellow, the qi’s appearance was dim and obscure.\" How can those who study the Dao fail to know the origin of the singular qi, the ancestor of the myriad things?\n\nThe numbers generate the Five Phases:\nWater: one (☰ Qian, Jia)\n\nOnce the Five Ultimates were divided and the Two Modes first separated, the Four Images then subtly arose, and the Five Phases secretly took form. Within them, the qi’s hues shifted and transformed, their shapes and images becoming distinct. After a million years of dim obscurity, the qi turned black. Black corresponds to the image of Water, whose generative number is one. One is the beginning of the Qian’s origin, the root of the Eight Trigrams, and gives rise to Jia. Jia is the first of the Five Phases and the origin of the ten celestial stems. Thus, in this primordial era, the sages observed its celestial patterns and inscribed the heavenly tally, recording the celestial patterns. Later, worthy successors reverently upheld this, marking the celestial origin and establishing the calendar through the arrangement of lines. From that time onward, the reckoning of years and seasons spread and became manifest.\n\nFire: two",

      "translated_text": "The black qi transformed again after a million years, turning crimson. Crimson corresponds to the image of Fire, whose generative number is two. Two is the beginning of the Xun trigram and gives rise to Xin.\n\nWood: three\nAfter a million years, the crimson qi turned verdant. Verdant corresponds to the image of Wood, whose generative number is three. Three is the beginning of the Gen trigram and gives rise to Bing.\n\nMetal: four\nAfter another million years, the verdant qi transformed into white. White corresponds to the image of Metal, whose generative number is four. Four is the beginning of the Kun trigram and gives rise to Gui.\n\nEarth: five\nAfter a million years, the white qi turned yellow. Yellow corresponds to the image of Earth, whose generative number is five. Five is the beginning of the Li trigram and gives rise to Ji.\n\nThe Completion Numbers of the Five Phases\nFrom the generative numbers to the completion numbers of the Five Phases: the odd numbers one, three, and five sum to the yang nine, governed by Jia and Bing, serving as the guest. As the central five of Earth (Li Ji) combines with Jia and the Water of one, it reaches the completion number six, descending to generate Kun Yi, thus moving first as the guest. The even numbers two and four sum to the yin six, governed by Xin and Gui, serving as the host. Further, the five of Earth added to the Fire of two reaches the completion number seven, ascending to generate Zhen Geng. Yi and Geng unite, exchanging north and south, thus moving later as the host. Water (one) and Fire (two) with Earth sum to ten, generating Kan Wu. Fire’s generative number (Xun Xin) follows Earth’s Ji to combine with Wood’s three (Gen Bing), reaching the completion number eight and generating Dui Ding. Water’s generative number (Qian Jia) also joins the central Earth’s five with Metal’s four (Kun Gui), reaching the completion number nine and generating Qian Ren. Ding and Ren unite, exchanging east and west. Thus, the transformations of two earths and three heavens are set in motion, reckoning the yang nine and yin six in generation and completion, revolving the stems and branches, distinguishing the soaring and hidden, and incorporating the Jia. With two ascending and one descending, water and fire are drawn and replenished; three are illuminated while four are concealed, and wood and metal interchange. Hence, the primordial Dao disperses as the foundation of the myriad transformations, its wondrous workings manifesting in the descent of a thousand spirits. How can those who cultivate the truth not delve into the origins of yin and yang?\n\nFire: six\nFrom the five of Earth added to the Water of one, reaching the completion number six, generating Kun Yi.\n\nFire: seven\nFrom the five of Earth added to the Fire of two, reaching the completion number seven, generating Zhen Geng.\n\nWood: eight\nFrom the five of Earth added to the Wood of three, reaching the completion number eight, generating Dui Ding.\n\nMetal: nine\nFrom the five of Earth added to the Metal of four, reaching the completion number nine, generating Qian Ren.\n\nEarth: ten\nFrom the five of Earth added to the five of Earth, reaching the completion number ten, generating Kan Wu. Thus, the Eight Trigrams are complete, and the ten celestial stems are fully arrayed. They blend and merge, the mother embracing the child’s womb, the child concealed within the mother’s body, yet to be distinguished.\n\nInterchange to Form Ten\nAs Qian and Kun pair, their completion numbers are fulfilled. Yang descends and yin ascends, floating and sinking, reversing and intertwining; rotating left and right, connecting above and below, the five positions interact, each finding its union. One and nine form ten: Ren and Jia meet, Qian pairs with Kun to generate Kan, which conceals Jia and Yi. Four and six form ten: Yi and Gui shift together, Kun pairs with Qian to generate Dui, which conceals Gui and Ren.\n\nInterchange to Form Ten\nThree and seven form ten: Geng and Bing meet, Qian pairs with Kun to generate Zhen, which conceals Bing and Ding. Two and eight form ten: Ding and Xin meet, Kun pairs with Qian to generate Li, which conceals Geng and Xin.\n\nEarth’s Image Self-Unites\nKan Wu: Li incorporates Ji to obtain five, Kan incorporates Wu to obtain ten, together summing to fifteen. This number attains the mean of heaven and earth, its position occupying the center of heaven and earth, thus requiring no pairing but uniting itself.\n\nThe Four Images Generate the Eight Trigrams\nFrom the Two Modes arise the Four Images. Within the Four Images, Kan’s completion number is six; its original trigram retains three, with three external numbers generating Qian, incorporating Ren but not Gui, as Qian and Kun pair and Gui is incorporated into Kun. Dui’s completion number is nine; its original trigram retains three, with six external numbers generating Kun, incorporating Yi but not Jia, as Kun and Qian unite and Jia is incorporated into Qian. Li’s completion number is seven; its original trigram retains three, with four external numbers generating Xun, incorporating Xin but not Geng, as Zhen and Xun interact and Geng is incorporated into Zhen. Zhen’s completion number is eight; its original trigram retains three, with five external numbers generating Gen, incorporating Bing but not Ding, as Gen and Dui interact and Ding is incorporated into Dui. Thus, the Five Phases are inverted and defined, their mutual transformations and changes clearly distinguished. The Eight Trigrams take form, their structures manifest and evident.\n\nThe middle son produces the old yang: Metal emerges from within Water. The youngest daughter gives birth to the old yin: Earth arises from within Metal. Only Wood is born of Fire, the middle daughter descending as Xun Xin. And Earth is born of Wood, the eldest son emerging as Gen Bing. From this, we discern the firmness and yielding, movement and stillness of Qian and Kun; the stirring and moistening of Zhen and Xun, wind and thunder; the meeting and separation of Bing and Ding at the corners; the clear divisions of soaring and hidden, shifting palaces. With the completion numbers established, the body reverses and cycles, the hun-soul transforms and roams, concealment and manifestation return to their origin, ascent and descent gather their traces. The eight celestial stems above undergo three positional shifts. Wu and Ji, formless and solitary, govern the four directions yet lack pairing. Ji, as yin, is incorporated into the middle daughter Li; Wu, as yang, is incorporated into the middle son Kan. Thus, the ten celestial stems are complete, their numbers forming odd and even, revealing the transformations of a single moment, the union of movement and stillness with the true. This fully expresses the Dao of observing heaven and mastering its movements. Those who cultivate the truth should diligently study the line texts, clearly follow the trigram structures, seize the ascent and descent of yin and yang above and below, and thoroughly explore the ebb and flow of generation and completion. With focused and inwardly refined intent, they will fathom the ceaseless changes of each day. When no regrets arise within the crucible, the purest qi descends, gold and mercury congeal into form, and the divine elixir is swiftly achieved—clear as the palm of one’s hand.",

Thus, in this primordial era, the sages observed its celestial patterns and inscribed the heavenly tally, recording the celestial patterns.

From that time onward, the reckoning of years and seasons spread and became manifest.\n\nFire: two",

They divide north and south, east and west, then return and interchange. Within them, Kan and Li serve as gates and portals, while Qian and Kun act as the pivot and vessel of the crucible. They propel the union of yin and yang, dispatching the two qi to race forth. With each descent and ascent, the stem spirits shift position; through the convergence of the Two Modes and Three Unions, the trigram images submit to their origin.\n\nThose who study the Dao must embody heaven and earth’s transformative workings and drive the sun and moon to share the same palace. With each inhalation and exhalation, a single celestial cycle is completed; with each gathering and dispersion, life and destiny are determined. As Laozi said: *\"The gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the root of heaven and earth.\"*\n\nWhen the yang tally is to move, Kun pursues Qian, emerging from the left; when yin holds authority, Qian follows Kun, responding from the right. Their ceaseless coming and going aligns with the principle of stem conjunction and trigram correspondence.\n\nThe formula states: Through exhalation, the number seven is formed—Li as fire, where true water descends within. Ji unites with Jia, and Jia, rejoicing, ascends, flying into the divine palace. Through inhalation, the number six is formed—Kan as water, where true fire rises within. Wu unites with Gui, and Gui, delighted, descends into the elixir chamber. Ding and Ren conjoin, returning to Li and Ji, like mountains and marshes exchanging qi, phoenix dancing and crow soaring. Yi and Geng gaze longingly, turning to Kan and Wu, like wind and thunder clashing, hare glowing and toad shining.\n\nThus, the four images return to the golden crucible, and the five phases gather into the jade furnace. Bing and Xin manifest, meeting Qian and Kun, uniting with Wu and Ji, and circulating the ten stems to return to the origin.

      "translated_text": "The inversion of the five phases is thus: Kan as water generates metal, producing Qian-metal, which conceals Jia and Yi, with flying and latent wood, its phase of growth beginning in Hai. Dui as metal generates earth, producing Kun-earth, which conceals Ren and Gui, with flying and latent water, its phase of growth beginning in Shen. Li as fire generates wood, producing Xun-wood, which conceals Geng and Xin, with flying and latent metal, its phase of growth beginning in Si. Zhen as wood generates earth, producing Gen-earth, which conceals Ding and Bing, with flying and latent fire, its phase of growth beginning in Yin.\n\nAs for Wu and Ji, they alone govern the center, flourishing in all four seasons, lodged in the southwest Kun-earth—the place where earth is most vigorous, its phase of growth beginning in Shen. This is called: with exhalation, the yang stems move in sequence; with inhalation, the yin stems reverse their course. Yin and yang, reversing and advancing, gather and disperse, concealed within the completion numbers. The completion numbers are the dynamic qi of the celestial origin.\n\n**Five Phases**　　　　　　**Stems Conjoin**\n\nWhen heaven and earth first divided, yin and yang separated into their positions. Heaven distributed the five qi, and earth arrayed the five phases. The five phases established their positions, governing the four directions; the five qi branched forth, scattering into the ten stems. The stem spirits shift their positions, pairing and generating one another, their forms and images distinctly manifesting their unions, deriving from the celestial origin’s five qi to become the true five phases.\n\nAll who cultivate the Dao must first thoroughly investigate the mechanism of stem-wheel interchange, then comprehend the images of their generative unions—this is the foundation for binding essence and life, the basis for the great elixir of transformation. When the root is established, the great Dao arises.\n\n**Jia-Ji True Earth**\nGui generates the wood spirits Jia and Yi in the east—water generating wood, with Wu as Jia’s father. The central yin-earth Ji is given to Jia as wife, and Jia-Ji unite to form true earth.\n\n**Yi-Geng True Metal**\nJi generates the metal spirits Geng and Xin in the west—earth generating metal, with Jia as Geng’s father. The eastern yin-wood Yi is given to Geng as wife, and Yi-Geng unite to form true metal.\n\n**Bing-Xin True Water**\nYi generates the fire spirits Bing and Ding in the south—wood generating fire, with Geng as Bing’s father. The western yin-metal Xin is given to Bing as wife, and Bing-Xin unite to form true water.\n\n**Ding-Ren True Wood**\nXin generates the water spirits Ren and Gui in the north—metal generating water, with Bing as Ren’s father. The southern yin-fire Ding is given to Ren as wife, and Ding-Ren unite to form true wood.\n\n**Wu-Gui True Fire**\nDing generates the earth spirits Wu and Ji in the center—fire generating earth, with Ren as Wu’s father. The northern yin-water Gui is given to Wu as wife, and Wu-Gui unite to form true fire.\n\nRevealed thus for application, cycling without end.\n\n**Wood and Metal Interspersed**\nThose who study the Dao must probe the root of essence and life, fathom the origin of transformation, discern the cause of wood and metal’s interspersion, clarify the principles of water and fire’s extraction and supplementation, grasp yin and yang’s manifest and latent states, and understand the floating and sinking of hun and po.\n\nThe interspersion of metal within wood: wood is yang-hun, embodied in the eastern Zhen trigram, which receives Geng as Kun’s eldest son—a single yang with two yins, thus yang-hun. It should ascend, but with two yins suppressing one yang, it cannot rise. In the human five viscera, this is the liver, submerged beneath lung-metal. The liver contains Geng-metal’s interspersion: though the liver’s true nature desires to float upward, Geng, as yin-po, steals the yang-hun, preventing its ascent and keeping it below. If one seizes the mysterious mechanism, circulating the fire tally of the celestial cycle for a thousand days without error, refining away the Geng-po within the liver, the liver returns to its ancestral nature, pure and unadulterated, and naturally ascends.\n\nLeng Ranzi asked: \"What in the liver is metal?\"\nAnswer: \"When the liver is born and enters water, it sinks—what sinks is metal. Wood and metal intermingle, its color becoming purple. Purple is metal. Thus it sinks below. When met with fire’s refining, it matures, the liver floats above, its color turning green, called *returning to the origin*. It regains its original nature, and the hun-spirit congeals, undisturbed.\"\n\nThe interspersion of wood within metal: metal conceals yin-po, belonging to the west, embodied in the Dui trigram. It should sink, yet instead floats—why? Dui is Qian’s youngest daughter, one yin with two yangs. The single yin cannot suppress the two yangs, so it floats above. Dui is Geng-metal; Yi and Geng unite, the wife following the husband’s chamber, with metal as the host. Metal is the lungs, but Yi-wood floats it, so metal lies above water. If one seizes the fire tally of the celestial cycle, refining for a thousand days without error, refining away the wood within the lungs, it becomes unadulterated, revealing metal’s original body, and naturally sinks.\n\nLeng Ranzi asked: \"What in the lungs is wood?\"\nAnswer: \"When the lungs are born, their color is red, but white is wood. Thus they float in water. When met with fire’s refining and matured, the lungs sink below, their color turning purple, returning to the true po of their original nature, settled and prolonging life.\"\n\n**Metal and Wood in Fire: Discerning Host and Guest**\nWhen metal and wood intermingle, fire restores their original natures. One must remove metal from wood and wood from metal. Since both are refined together, why is metal alone removed from wood while wood remains, and wood alone removed from metal while metal remains?\n\nRemoving metal from wood: wood has its original form as host, while metal, hidden within, is a floating guest in color. When refined by fire, the guest departs first, preserving the host. Removing wood from metal: metal has its rigid body as host, while wood within is soft and a guest. When refined by fire, the host remains while the guest departs.",

      "translated_text": "In all who cultivate the true Dao, one must clarify the causes of refining metal and wood, thoroughly investigate the principles of host and guest in their preservation or loss, rely on the fire’s timing without error, and follow the measures for withdrawing and adding lead and mercury. Then, without waiting for days, the elixir will naturally form.\n\nMaster Pingshu notes: Nurturing the elixir without fire is like a mother holding a dead fetus—prolonged effort yields no result, only futile labor. How is this different in principle from metal and wood, which only reveal their natures when refined by fire?\n\n**Water and Fire: Attainment and Non-Attainment**\nThe natures of water and fire mutually contain and gestate one another. Within water there is fire, and within fire there is water. What is meant by \"within water there is fire\"? Water belongs to the northern *Kan* trigram, embracing yang within yin. That water can reflect objects is the true fire. In the human body’s five viscera, water corresponds to the kidneys, which store essence—essence being fire.\n\nWhat is meant by \"within fire there is water\"? Fire belongs to the southern *Li* trigram, embracing yin within yang. The blackness at the heart of fire is the true water. In the five viscera, fire corresponds to the heart, which governs blood—blood being water.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"When water is above fire, it is *jiji* (attainment); when fire is above water, it is *weiji* (non-attainment).\" Master Pingshu notes: \"Within water, three fires gather; within fire, water refines and steams.\" All who cultivate the Dao rely on method and image to harmonize yin and yang, mastering the subtle transformations of the key and lock, causing water and fire to ascend and descend. By adding and withdrawing in accord with *jiji* and *weiji*, lead and mercury naturally congeal within the crucible, and the elixir forms—then golden light fills the chamber.\n\n**Water and Fire Ascend and Descend Through Earth**\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Water flows toward the moist; fire tends toward the dry.\" Without awareness, they respond to one another, revealing the principle of nature. Yet water is said to moisten and descend, fire to flame and ascend. How then, in *jiji*, does water remain above while fire stays below? Within *Kan* water there is fire because *Kan* receives *wu* (yang), which is pure and becomes essence, transforming into clear yang qi that ascends to become true water. Within *Li* fire there is water because *Li* receives *ji* (yin), which is turbid and becomes blood, transforming into heavy turbid qi that descends to become true fire.\n\nWater and fire are the true qi of Heaven’s origin, born from the spleen. The spirit of the spleen governs creation alone, residing at the center, revolving the four directions, ascending and descending with each breath. When the qi of Heaven’s origin moves, one breath contains five—subtly aligning with the five phases.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Heaven’s number is five; Earth’s number is six\"—the central number of yin and yang. This central number refers to earth. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving from beginning to end. Green, red, white, and black each occupy a direction, while the central palace receives the work of *wu* and *ji*.\" Master Pingshu also says: \"The four images and five phases all rely on earth.\" Without the central qi of *wu* and *ji* circulating between *Kan* and *Li*, the divine elixir will never be produced.\n\n**The Qi of Kan and Li Transform and Return to the Origin**\nWithin the heart, mercury is concealed; within the kidneys, lead is hidden. How are these two substances to be employed? Through the inverted technique of the five phases, true fire transforms into divine water, lead and mercury become wandering souls, and breath rises with the wind—naturally accomplishing the work of creation.\n\nWhen the qi of Heaven’s origin stirs in the kidneys, *Kan*’s *wu* is yang, and one exhalation moves five. When the qi of Earth’s origin stirs in the heart, *Li*’s *ji* is yin, and one inhalation moves five. The movement of yin and yang qi combines to make ten. The *Book of Changes* states: \"Heaven is nine; Earth is ten\"—*wu* and *ji* naturally unite.\n\nDrawing mercury from the heart transforms it into essence; ascending lead from the kidneys transforms it into qi. Essence and qi become things and change, naturally coagulating into the *daogui*. When mercury is drawn from the heart, true water descends, and the *Li* trigram sheds its yin to become the *Qian* body. *Qian* is Heaven—light and clear, without yin. Those who align with this naturally extinguish the seven emotions and melt the six desires like ice.\n\nWhen lead ascends from the kidneys, true fire rises, and the *Kan* trigram sheds its yang to become the *Kun* image. *Kun* is Earth—heavy and turbid, without yang. Those who align with this naturally gather the three into a circle, and the myriad conditions of the heart dissolve.\n\nDevotees of the Dao, take heed of these words.\n\nI have heard Guangchengzi say: \"Above the celestial pivot, the qi of Heaven’s origin governs; below the celestial pivot, the qi of Earth’s origin governs; at the celestial pivot, the source of yin and yang follows.\" Those who cultivate the Dao model their forms on Heaven and Earth. The head is round like Heaven, the root of clear yang, revolving the seven luminaries, responding to the movement of the pivot, assisting the Purple Tenuity and the Valley of Emptiness, with the primordial spirit encircling it.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"Imitate the way the seven luminaries revolve in emptiness—seizing yang to refine yin.\" *Tan* and *Ju* correspond to the two ears. They assist the numinous terrace, preventing the dust of the world from staining it, the myriad conditions from clinging to it, so that the spirit’s awareness becomes still and settled.\n\n*Lu* and *Wen* correspond to the two eyes. If they are opened, the spirit scatters outward; if closed, the spirit settles within. *Lian* and *Wu* connect the path of the assisting ministers, piercing the Gate of the Mysterious Female—the root of Heaven and Earth, the key to nature and life. Exchanging them in due time, continuously as if present, the five spirits interact, and the elixir furnace’s fire blazes.\n\n*Pojun* guards the Metal Pass, sealing the Earth’s gate, fanning the true wind within, so that water qi cannot assail. It secures the golden womb, preventing leakage, and the essence of the red dragon causes the Three Corpses to flee. With the heart cold and the six bandits trembling in fear, fire burns the golden crucible, water overflows the Jade Pass, and the original qi of the entire body flows through the three fields above and below.\n\nThe eight trigrams of the body: *Li* is the Crimson Palace, the meeting place of *jia* and *si*, the land where tiger and dragon transform and arise—the dwelling of the ten thousand spirits.",
      "overlap_context": "al. Since both are refined together, why is metal alone removed from wood while wood remains, and wood alone removed from metal while metal remains?\n\nRemoving metal from wood: wood has its original form as host, while metal, hidden within, is a floating guest in color. When refined by fire, the guest departs first, preserving the host. Removing wood from metal: metal has its rigid body as host, while wood within is soft and a guest. When refined by fire, the host remains while the guest departs.",

added growth.\nWhen creation congeals the immortal elixir’s body,\nConsume it in due time to ascend in spirit-flight—\nBeyond the sun’s flight, one attains carefree wandering.\n\n*Again*\nWith each breath, the medicinal aroma deepens,\nThe five spirits stir, stirring golden sand from the sea.\nThe immortal of the Celestial River ferries the sacred raft.\nWater fills the golden city, congealing cold dew,\nMan and ox vanish, the moon shines empty splendor—\nA pure wind bears one homeward in laughter.\n\n*Ten Thousand Springtimes*\nJade lock and golden pass exchange seals and closures—\n\nJade lock and golden pass,\nYin and yang strike the watchman’s clapper, firmly sealed.\nMutually congealing, they restrain.\nTransforming without attachment,\nThe belly brims with fine, cool wind.\nIn the nine qi of heaven,\nClouds tread without the slightest veil.\nThe root and stem of Dao,\nSilently harmonizing,\nPervade the three realms in clarity.\n\n*Again*\nA single qi of harmonious surge,\nThe heart-ape tightly locked, unable to flee.\nTamed and softened, it receives—\nThe pass is sealed in secrecy,\nGuarded by the Great One’s misty embrace.\nWhen the two merge,\nSilent and dim, they endure long—\nForming the odd and even,\nRefinement must reach nine nines.\nThen one enjoys the boundless longevity of emptiness.\n\n*Again*\nVast qi flows and circulates,\nContinuously cradling true *chan* stillness.\nNurturing the spirit, it rises—\nProfound and obscure, hard to awaken,\nCongealing the mysterious and yellow to gestate.\nCreation’s round emptiness,\nPolishes the spirit-terrace to translucence.\nEver responsive,\nThe wood-child’s form excels,\nStepping steadily along the cloud-radiance path.\n\n*Slow Tune of the River Spirit: True Sitting*\nCultivating truth amidst ten thousand entanglements,\nThe mind’s ground demands fierce effort.\nNurturing the foolish and clumsy,\nReleasing the four great elements,\nOne rests at ease, untroubled.\nWill like iron—\nVigorously severing the horse and ape, breaking both legs,\nCeasing all waywardness, gathering all into quiescence.\nThe eight passes, six viscera, and three palaces,\nAll harmonized and smooth,\nThe ten thousand spirits rejoice.\nTortoise-breath, mysterious and unbroken,\nAttains limpid stillness—mother and child,\nRound and conjoined.\nThe two natures merge—\nRevealing the yang body,\nRefined to the moment of flight.\nThe mind, ice-pure,\nCreation’s true emptiness returns beyond things,\nThe effortless Dao, perfectly complete, yet seeming incomplete.\nReleasing the nature-moon’s radiance,\nIt pierces through heaven and earth.\n\n*Slow Tune of the River Spirit: False Sitting*\nThe valley spirit dies, unaroused,\nBurrowed in delusion, the heart errs in its merit.\nFutilely chiseling,\nSeeking the mysterious and wondrous,\nRelying on the water and grain’s cloud-root.\nWasted effort—\nTwisting and contorting the body, constantly grasping,\nFocusing intently, the earthly pass lacks lock and key.\nThe heavenly gate remains unbroken, tightly sealed,\nHow could qi linger between being and non-being?\nThe three palaces’ ascent and descent are hindered,\nClinging to one nature, losing the returned,\nThe dregs of the Western advent.\nDao’s essence thins—\nThe soul and spirit stray,\nIn motion and stillness, dragon and tiger coil.\nIgnorant of the sacred key,\nHow can one refine the jade crucible’s golden water?\nWithout the elixir’s body,\nHow could one tread the clouds in joy?\nIf by chance the mysterious mechanism becomes clear,\nOne may meet the Penglai covenant.\n\n*No Mundane Thoughts: Qi Deviance*\nOne breath, one sigh,\nIgnoring the valley spirit, the mysterious female’s continuity falters.\nHurried gathering and scattering defy creation,\nRoot and stem hang precariously, far removed.\nNo return above or below,\nComing and going lose control,\nNot directed toward the three palaces.\nInternally lost, seeking the superior,\nThe mind clings to one fixed point.\nExternally flooding the four limbs and skin,\nFloating and scattered, restless,\nClumsily unsettled.\nBeholding the body’s many tremors,\nTransforming a thousandfold—how could it be otherwise?\nThe mind not reduced to cold ashes,\nThe form not withered like deadwood,\nLife and nature diverge like cloud and mud.\nChan’s power stagnates—\nHow could one achieve the pure yang body?\n\n*Plum Blossoms by the River: Qi Deviance Returned to Right*\nA vast qi stirs in the Primordial Palace,\nAligning with refined cultivation, moving the pure wind.\nPiercing the three passes,\nNaturally filling above and below.\nThe victorious external wanderings are drawn inward,\nAll in one finger’s span,\nGathered into the jade path’s midst.\nThe spirit welcomes the celestial valley, proud in the clear sky,\nNurturing harmony and fusion, attaining free flow.\nThe body, unentangled, becomes limpid—\nProfound stillness verifies the *Can Tong Qi*.\nSelf and other both forgotten, truly expansive,\nThe principle of non-action,\nPerfectly complete,\nReveals sacred merit.\n\n*Plum Blossoms by the River: Spirit Deviance*\nThe four limbs’ qi scatters, losing root and sprout—\nBecoming spirit deviance, emitting empty flowers.\nA thousand strange phenomena,\nBefore the eyes, chaotic as hemp.\nAll sages and worthies appear at will,\nTransforming endlessly,\nAll due to a single thought’s deviation.\nUnaware of the heart’s illness, still boasting,\nScenes boundless, affairs deemed fine.\nSpecially obscuring the mysterious and unobstructed,\nThe Dao-eye veiled by dust.\nNot practicing true *chan*, one falls into demonic realms—\nYin and yang sundered,\nSee how one refines the cinnabar sand.\n\n*Plum Blossoms by the River: Spirit Deviance Returned to Right*\nThe numinous breast, washed clean of dust and filth,\nThe illusory form hollowed, the outer guise foolish.\nIn the tranquil and indifferent realm,\nOne gallops, delighting in Dao’s essence.\nA single qi restrains the spirit, the spirit intoxicated,\nRiding drunkenness in dance,\nGolden lads and jade maidens lend support.\nThe mysterious mechanism’s true creation demands diligent effort—\nShedding the mortal frame,\nEntering emptiness.\nExpansive and luminous,\nThe nature-moon, solitary and round.\nColdly immersed in *chan*’s heaven, wind and mist still,\nThe ice-flesh’s radiance,\nProud and limpid,\nShines like a jade flask.\n\n*Again*\nScenery forgotten, passions extinguished, ten thousand entanglements sparse,\nGazing and cleansing, Dao’s essence unfurls.\nGrasping the origin,\nSpirit and breath move slowly.\nNurturing the spirit-terrace, still as a mountain,\nEver silent,\nRegulating the spirit, with surplus to spare.\nThe forest of true realms, proud in *Huaxu*,\nRevealing the primordial beginning,\nWondrously thus.\nFormless, majestic,\nThe appearance aligns with emptiness.\nDancing and frolicking, unobstructed,\nSinging wildly,\nRejoicing unrestrained,\nLike *Jieyu*.\n\n*Again*\nTen thousand slants do not mar the solitary spirit’s wonder—\nThe wondrous appearance aligns with emptiness.\nThe sea of awakening, vast and boundless,\nShines uniquely, surpassing the black pearl.\nClouds still, water cold, without the slightest veil,\nThe pure body,\nPierces mountains and walls with ease.\nIn the wild, no one—proud as a pair of wild ducks,\nStriding the heavenly thoroughfare,\nPlaying in the immortal capital.\nA single point of round clarity,\nUnrestrained by transformation.\nThe belly, full of harmonious surge, cradles fine jade,\nSecretly stored in the treasury,\nNo longer seeking,\nTo sell at a good price.\n\n*Immortal in the Moon: Guest and Host Exchange*\nSeeking the wondrous, cultivating truth,\nDividing the

      "translated_text": "**Long Thought of the Immortal**\n\nIn the formless realm, life returns to emptiness,\nNature returns to emptiness.\nObject and self both forgotten, the wind of wisdom unfurls,\nIn profound obscurity, all merges as one.\n\nExerting spiritual work, uniting with primordial chaos,\nThe pristine radiance of spirit shines amid heaven and earth.\nThe formless body flows freely everywhere.\n\n---\n\nThe mind settled, awareness stilled,\nHost and guest dwell together in profound tranquility.\nNeither ox nor man is seen in form.\nThe true nature is numinous, the image is numinous,\nIn movement and stillness, non-doing merges with the boundless dark.\nPerfect emptiness pervades above and below.\n\n---\n\n**Immortal of the Yellow Crane Grotto – Stubborn Emptiness**\n\nDeeply stained by the illness of stubborn emptiness,\nUnknowing of the true mandate of cultivation.\nIn vain, one remains blind to the transformations of yin and yang,\nThe true heart’s mirror shrouded in dense obscurity.\n\nSevering thoughts to perceive the nature—\nThis is but sinking into hollow purity.\nWithout refining the elixir to perfect the wondrous body,\nOne shall never, even after long ages, return to sagehood.\n\n---\n\nThe root of life and nature is profound,\nThe Dao’s foundation lies in yin and yang’s creation.\nTo cling solely to the purity of a single point of spirit’s light\nIs to nearly lose sight of heaven’s Way.\n\nThe Three Thieves must be deeply investigated,\nThe Four Images must be inversely examined.\nSeizing the power of heaven and earth’s transformations,\nOne crystallizes the treasure of perfect clarity.\n\n---\n\n**A Sprig of Plum Blossoms – Severing Emptiness**\n\nSeizing the fire’s timing of the celestial cycle,\nThe elixir furnace burns day and night,\nSimmering mercury, refining lead.\nFrom the sea’s depths and riverbanks, qi billows like smoke,\nDay after day surging, penetrating the Three Fields.\n\nFailing to awaken, one sinks into the trance of profound meditation—\nSpirit scatters, qi disperses,\nMother and child cannot unite.\nYin and yang lose their union, the mystery obscured.\nFor nine years and three, the crucible’s heaven remains unseen.\n\n---\n\nA single qi ascends, the precious tripod seethes,\nWater and fire intermingle,\nLead flies along the jade path.\nYet without spirit’s steadfastness, the two cannot merge as one,\nSeparated as if by clouds and mud,\nThe profound mystery remains unattainable.\n\nIt is essential to still the heart and sever the myriad entanglements,\nThen nature and life naturally blend, returning to Chan.\nThe yang soul transforms, freely ascending,\nIn a hundred days and a thousand mornings,\nCloud-stepping into the crucible’s heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Gazing at the Tide – True Emptiness**\n\nTrue emptiness is the root and foundation,\nWholly reliant on spirit and breath,\nDifferentiating the essence of the Five Aggregates.\nHarmonizing the six spirits, suffusing the Three Isles,\nThe Milky Way’s waves surge with the numinous raft.\nThe Qian tripod simmers cinnabar,\nAs clouds bear the Kun ox,\nAnd the wind conveys the ram-drawn chariot.\nSecretly circulating the Yellow Gold Well,\nForming resplendence, crystallizing jade-like blossoms.\n\nThe most wondrous livelihood flourishes,\nManifesting the principle in perfect emptiness,\nWith a profound vision unmarred.\nPure and undivided, the One True,\nPenetrating heaven and earth,\nVast and unhindered, without obstruction.\nThe square inch of the heart encompasses river sands.\nFreely delighting in wind and moon,\nIntoxicated, reclining amid mist and rosy clouds.\nWithin this, the true message is imparted—\nBestowed solely upon the family of Daoists.\n\n---\n\nForm and spirit both wondrous,\nSpirit unobstructed, transcendent,\nSolemnly independent in profound mystery.\nRevealing principle, simplifying emotions,\nEmptiness and form without barrier,\nUnveiling the ultimate cause.\nThe ancestral intent is secretly transmitted in emptiness.\nAs the mind’s realm and all phenomena dissolve,\nWisdom’s understanding is entirely dispelled.\nA single stretch of true purity,\nExpanding the spirit’s transformation,\nEmerging from Kun and Qian.\n\nThe wondrous body of vast emptiness is perfected,\nManifesting thusness without image,\nLoftily proud in the heavens of Chan.\nResplendent wisdom’s light,\nMajestic true reality,\nThe boundless Dharma realm of the myriad phenomena.\nUniting with the Dao, one wields mighty power,\nHaving shattered the void,\nEven kalpas’ force cannot refine.\nShattering the shell of rebirth,\nEmbracing the True One,\nTranscending the flow of years.\n\n---\n\n**Laozi’s Chant – Three Thousand Merits**\n\nPurifying the spirit, seizing the phoenix’s marrow,\nCessation of breath gathers the crow’s blood.\nSix yangs soar through the cosmos,\nFive qi penetrate the joints.\nClouds, thunder, wind, and lightning strike,\nToward the Three Heavens,\nDescending ice and snow.\nJade mountains and sea peaks spew crimson mist,\nResplendent as daylight,\nThe nature’s light shines through.\n\nThe two passions unite.\nThe heavens of Chan equalize the transformations of things,\nThe mind writes the script of awe and joy.\nThe yang soul fully embodies creation,\nCalled true merit—\nMerit most wondrous.\nThe three thousand numbers unite without flaw.\nSpirit transcends beyond the realm of things,\nForever departing birth and extinction.\n\n---\n\nA numinous wind permeates the marrow,\nVital qi fills the limbs and joints.\nDrawing and adding from Li and Kan,\nIn movement and stillness, they are arranged in exchange.\nThe tally of the celestial cycle is complete,\nGathering yin and yang,\nQi and spirit conjoin.\nThe Yellow Court’s brocade canopy is fully pregnant with auspice,\nTransforming the yang soul,\nThe sacred land’s heaven is thoroughly penetrated.\n\nIn fine distinction,\nThe three thousand true transformations,\nThe ebb and flow of the mysterious and the yellow are revealed.\nThe nature’s light is without a speck of defilement,\nLuminous as ice,\nSpreading pure snow.\nInstantly transcending the Three Realms in true joy,\nSinging and chanting, wandering the Gardens of Lang,\nThe Dao’s sentiment is supremely pure.\n\n---\n\n**Laozi’s Chant – Eight Hundred Practices**\n\nThe numinous source is without a speck of defilement,\nEver responsive, ever pure.\nYin and yang have ceased their union,\nMother and child rejoice in the same palace.\nEmbracing the True One in emptiness,\nExpanding perfect clarity,\nIlluminating the heart’s mirror.\nEverywhere, enlightenment shatters, returning to extinction,\nThe wondrous function of the Dharma vast and boundless.\n\nPossessing true practice,\nCompassion shapes the Dao’s foundation,\nSorrow and empathy, the heart without contention.\nUniversally bestowing, benefiting all things,\nHolding humility as virtue,\nWielding it as authority.\nPerfecting the eight hundred, the fruit of no-leakage,\nInstantly transcending the cloud steps steadily,\nShedding the mortal to return to sagehood.\n\n---\n\n**Freeing the Heart – Returning to Youth**\n\nEarth, water, fire, wind,\nComposing the Four Great,\nIn the end, aging decays into emptiness.\nLife and death, like the cicada’s molt,\nRely on wondrous work in solemn cultivation.\nUniting with heaven and earth, shifting true creation,\nYin and yang’s movement, matching female and male.\nThe spirit’s embryo splits and judges,\nThe numinous body suffuses in mist,\nLight and healthy, returning to youth.\n\nNurturing thusness to perfection,\nThe mysterious emperor’s message,\nCrafted to emptiness, the Dharma image spiritually penetrates.\nSecretly harboring vast qi,\nExpanding transformations,\nThe body boundless.\nFreely resplendent, in the original form,\nMounting the simurgh and crane, laughing proudly in the heavens.\nUnrestrained and at ease,\nManifesting transcendence from the mortal to the sage,\nA thousand ages of pure wind.\n\n---\n\nA single qi’s mysterious work.",

Hegemons’ rivers and mountains.\nHow many rises and falls,\nBut a dream in Nanke.\nTime silently wears all away.\nAwakened to misty mountains and flowing waters,\nI long to return—\nStaff in hand, straw cloak donned.\nLet the seasons pass,\nDelighting in nurturing spirit and cultivating qi,\nWhether moving or still, all is leisurely drift.\n\nAt home, snow on the plum, fire on the jujube,\nBrewing a jade flask’s shimmering waves,\nFilling it with golden ripples.\nDrinking to blissful intoxication,\nSpirit soaring beyond the clouds,\nTrue joy arises in carefree chanting.\nAccompanied by the clear wind and bright moon,\nThrough the heavens’ clarity,\nDancing and whirling in freedom.\nReleasing harmonious qi,\nAttaining the primordial body’s form,\nTranscending the farthest shores.\n\n**II**\n\nReturning to the root, cultivating the real.\nAwaiting the first stir of yang,\nThe five qi fully extended.\nThe Golden Lad bestows righteousness,\nThe Jade Maiden spreads benevolence.\nHard and soft harmonize in union.\nGathering in the Yellow Court’s immortal hall,\nWisdom’s wind guides,\nFeasting with all spirits.\nAuspicious mist thickens,\nFloating in the jade flask’s snowy waves,\nRefining and infusing lead and silver.\n\nSkin like ice, radiant in rosy curtains,\nIntoxicated by the three wonders’ light,\nJade petals fresh and pure.\nBody smooth as orchid fragrance,\nSoul soaring on feathered wings,\nKeeping company with Dao and virtue.\nProud in the vast emptiness,\nTruly pure and still,\nUnchanging, ever-spring.\nThe treasure within nature\nIllumines the ten directions and three realms,\nTranscending the icy moon.\n\n---\n\n**Water Melody**\n\nNurturing the true life with harmony,\nSpirit’s radiance shatters the murky paths.\nAmidst bright mountains and waters,\nIn the depths of Thunder Marsh, the mysterious pearl gestates.\nThe Seven Luminaries pivot around the Northern Star,\nResplendent golden flower qi congeals,\nWithered wood revives anew.\nThe numinous viscera, wind and mist stilled,\nAt the mountain’s peak, the moon’s wheel stands alone.\n\nPiercing the three heavens,\nNourishing the nine cauldrons,\nDrinking the jade nectar.\nIn Huaxu’s realm, laughing and carefree,\nDeeply intoxicated, jade lads lend support.\nGraceful as the magic mushroom chariot, crane-drawn,\nGalloping through the pure yang’s sacred realm,\nEven the cosmos cannot confine.\nThe serene, precelestial visage,\nManifest or hidden, merges with emptiness.\n\n**II**\n\nWisdom’s wind sweeps away demonic obstructions,\nThe sacred sword severs the wheel of rebirth.\nWithin, spirit and breath settle,\nDriving forth sweet dew to sprinkle the numinous terrace.\nThe four images, five phases, and three-in-one\nGather in the cauldron, mist thickening like bellows’ key,\nStirring clouds and thunder to life.\nWater cradles golden blossoms,\nFire nurtures jade lotuses to bloom.\n\nAligning with celestial patterns,\nHarmonizing nine and six,\nUniting the three powers.\nAiding the formation of a robust body,\nClear wind and bright moon as eternal companions.\nIn the profound and obscure, essence transforms,\nMerging into the formless Dao’s alchemy,\nSpirit’s function vast and boundless.\nSeemingly returning to ultimate bliss,\nIn an instant, savoring Penglai.\n\n---\n\n**Dispelling Sorrow**\n\nThrough the ages, the common way:\nThe strong often bully the weak.\nAnts’ quarrels breed strife and evil.\nHeaven watches through the eye of Confucius,\nDetermining wealth and nobility—\nNo principle is arbitrary.\nThe resolute and heroic,\nNone compare to those who seek Dao,\nEmbracing utmost emptiness and pure joy.\nSwiftly harmonizing wood’s liquid and metal’s essence,\nWithin the nine-tiered jade palace,\nRefining the mysterious frost elixir.\n\nRadiant,\nThe chamber gleams with splendor,\nThe yang body takes flight,\nTransforming beyond all bounds.\nReleasing the heart beneath the bright moon,\nIndulging in intoxication,\nJade lads pour the wine.\nAll sounds—whistling winds and pipes—\nResound in clarity.\nProud beyond the mundane,\nIn the vast and serene expanse,\nThe ancestral intent shines alone,\nZen’s heavens thoroughly penetrated,\nSecuring the path to longest life.\n\n---\n\n**Slow River of Crimson**\n\nSeeing through glory and splendor,\nWielding wisdom’s sword,\nSwiftly fleeing life and death.\nCast aside cleverness,\nShatter the body, empty the chamber,\nInwardly delve into principle.\nGreen waters and blue mountains as companions,\nClear wind and bright moon as confidants.\nSinging and rejoicing in the celestial truth,\nThe beauty of the eternal real.\n\nHeart serene,\nSpirit joyful.\nFlowing freely,\nMoving or still at will.\nLike a solitary cloud or wild crane,\nComing and going beyond measure.\nThe true wind of Śākya earnestly tended,\nCleansing all hindrances, coarse and

instance, the true form manifests,\nThrough kalpas, its image endures.\nNeither within nor without, the true realm revealed,\nUnborn and undying, penetrating celestial clarity.\nHaving shattered the void,\nEscaping the wheel of rebirth,\nEnjoying longevity without end.\n\n---\n\n**Candlelight Sways Red: For Gao Yingchan**\n\nHeart cold toward schemers,\nWill follows the teaching father to seek the ancestral root.\nHeaven’s secret art first expands,\nIce and snow fill the numinous viscera.\nSealing the metal and earth cauldron,\nRegulating yin and yang,\nRevolving the cycles of zi and wu.\nRising and descending in due time,\nCreation’s mystery, the formless,\nThe three lights radiantly emerge.\n\nLife and nature mutually sustain,\nHeaven and earth harmonize, roles defined.\nIn profound stillness, merging with spirit’s work,\nThe dharma image pervades the sands.\nThis principle—do not slight it,\nNor indulge desires, transgressing bounds.\nOne day, merit complete,\nReturning to the three isles together,\nName surpassing past and present.\n\n**II: Warning of Good and Evil**\n\nThe Dao’s gate opens,\nAt the destined moment of jiazi’s celestial origin.\nThe Three Pure Ones’ immortal courts list the names,\nRefinement must transcend the ordinary.\nThis is the hidden one’s awakened truth,\nAbandoning glory, pure clouds unattended.\nCarving open perfect enlightenment,\nShattering the void,\nClimbing the ladder to the cloud path.\n\nFoolish streams lost in the sea of desire,\nDelighting in the husk’s return to myriad destinies.\nIn the darkest night,

untold,\nOnce fame, profit, *qi*, and wealth are seen through,\nTheir lingering winds swept clean in a single stroke.\nA heart of pure integrity remains.\nComprehending the three thieves within,\nOne steers the stars and constellations,\nGuides the Silver River’s turning,\nYet pours waves over the elixir crucible.\nMysterious and yellow *qi* lead the way,\nBinding earth’s marrow and heaven’s essence,\nSuddenly soaring, then tumbling in chaos.\nRefining jade, smelting gold,\nSpirit transforms into utter emptiness,\nThe body merges with the profound mystery of *xi yi*.\nRising high on iridescent clouds,\nRevealing the wondrous form,\nAbiding in true emptiness with eternal pride.\nSuch flavors of the Way—\nYet worldly folk, though near, never attain.\n\n**II: Brewing the Golden Elixir**\n\nIrrigating the three fields above and below,\nWashing away eons of dust in a single rinse.\nNurturing the vastness like Yan Hui’s master,\nEmbracing poverty’s joy, admiring Yan Hui’s ease,\nFloating on lakes like Fan Li’s light skiff.\nWithin, one unfolds magnanimity and harmony,\nReveling in the wondrous garden,\nWhere the Dao’s winds flourish abundantly.\nPurifying the heart’s illumination,\nNever straying from oneness,\nEmbracing softness and following ritual.\nThe breast brims with cloud-capped majesty,\nStealing the moon palace’s toad essence,\nThe sun palace’s crow marrow.\nThese two substances mutually nourish,\nRefining jade frost and cinnabar,\nFilling the chamber with cinnabar radiance.\nTransforming into a mysterious body,\nSurely becoming the primal yang soul’s leader.\nTreading the wind, transcending,\nNot dwelling in the nine heavens’ bounds.\n\n**Water Dragon’s Chant: Harmonious Nurturing Following Heaven’s Numbers**\n\nSilently aligning with the celestial cycles,\nUnseen, it entwines the revolving measures.\nYin and yang’s longing forms,\nWind, thunder, clouds, and lightning,\nCongeal to bring forth timely rains.\nDroplet by droplet, the numinous source pours,\nIrrigating all,\nYet old dust cannot defile.\nThe winding river gleams pure,\nCrows seize the jade hare,\nOsmanthus branches bloom,\nSpilling crimson mists.\nThe two *qi* blend and gather,\nScattering golden light,\nThree mountains densely arrayed.\nTempering a robust body,\nA youthful visage moistened,\nWith ample leisure to soar.\nSpirit transcends the mundane,\nBeyond the dust, in pristine clarity,\nThe true countenance fully revealed.\nThis is the kalpa’s one thread,\nA living craft through heaven,\nAwaiting each person’s awakening.\n\n**II: Heaven and Earth’s Judgment of Yin and Yang’s Positions**\n\nPrimal simplicity scatters, *qi* swirls to form vessels.\nThe mother’s womb holds the child’s belly,\nThe child is born of the mother,\nMysteriously parting auspicious signs.\nThe body refines into purity,\nExpanding the spirit’s chamber,\nClouds recede, dust burdens lifted.\nWind clears, moon brightens,\nGolden youths dance,\nReveling on Mount Jia,\nScenes wondrous and strange.\nReturning from the feast, deeply intoxicated,\nArriving at Hua Xu,\nYet the jade pass remains barred.\nSplitting the jade curtain,\nThe host invites me,\nSecretly transmitting the ancestral intent.\nHow could there be three voids?\nThe body manifests purity,\nPerfect clarity, non-dual.\nFreely roaming, unbound,\nUnentangled, unshackled,\nLike the vast emptiness itself.\n\n**III: Wisdom Sweeps Away the Thicket, Opening the Heart-Ground**\n\n*Qi* nurtures, *qi* swirls in purity.\nThe three wonders gather in the crucible,\nWithin the blazing fire,\nThe elixir flower blooms auspiciously.\nFrom the sea’s depths, a clear breeze rises,\nExotic fragrance sprays,\nLush and rich in form.\nWooden lads playfully tease,\nSoaring unimpeded,\nAdorned by jewel-bright light,\nFlames of rosy clouds ablaze.\nThe secret chamber, cool and ever-charming,\nExpands the breast,\nBathed in frost’s radiance.\nSmoke vanishes, fire extinguishes,\nClouds recede, mists disperse,\nInstantly becoming non-dual.\nWith towering presence, carefree,\nAffairs merge with river sands,\nLight and dust undifferentiated.\nThis primal wondrous existence,\nThe pure and empty Dharma-body,\nAttains the bodhisattva’s rank.\n\n**IV: The Perfected One Grasps the Handle of Cultivating Truth**\n\nBeyond the ordinary, delving into the profound words’ ultimate meaning.\nLimpid, deep contemplation,\nUnbroken, perfect breath,\n*Qi* swirls in true nature.\nA single fusion with the blazing wind’s force,\nFive gates open,\nThree wonders’ light converges.\nAt the time of fullness and emptiness,\nYin and yang transform toward peace,\nRevealing the true creation,\nHarmonizing with heaven’s mandate.\nComposing the spirit’s centeredness,\nManifesting eternal spring,\nWind and light towering and distant.\nMyriad strands of rosy clouds,\nA range of misty peaks,\nFill the sky with clarity.\nDistant and near pavilions,\nReflecting cloud-borne steps,\nCarefree in song and chant.\nReveling in the cool Dharma-realm,\nAt ease in life’s craft,\nAttaining the saint of non-action.\n\n**Auspicious Crane Immortal: Cherishing the Heart’s Devotion to Simplicity**\n\nInwardly revering plainness and frugality,\nDrifting like duckweed,\nFootprints lost in waves of sinking.\nWisdom and brilliance never employed,\nRecalling riches that shake the heavens,\nMistaken dreams startling one awake.\nFiercely severing the cords of desire,\nSeeking the leisure of true winds,\nGraceful and ample.\nThe valley spirit at peace,\nBreath slows, connecting to truth,\nThe primal *qi* stirs the bellows’ key.\nSpending freely from jade crucible and golden tripod,\nFire billows, clouds surge,\nMysteriously conceiving the elixir medicine.\nSpirit and soul refined,\nBecoming pure and vast in form.\nToward the profound and boundless,\nPenetrating the pot’s heaven,\nGrasping the joy of cool winds and ease.\nMerging with emptiness,\nTruly pure, truly clear,\nResolving the one move of emptiness.\n\n**Eternal Joy: Wondrous Alignment with Heaven’s Wheel**\n\nMastering the celestial wheel,\nTurning the pivot of the seven governors,\nThe jade balance revolves.\nSilently operating ascent and descent,\nPushing to the limits of creation,\nA single *qi* transforms the three wonders.\nTortoise essence, toad marrow,\nPhoenix fluid, crow blood,\nBoiling in the crucible’s rolling brew.\nThe mysterious pearl forms,\nGolden medicine fresh and radiant,\nSpewing forth nine dragons’ lightning.\nThe infant enters the golden chamber,\nThe maiden returns to the silver palace,\nPipes and songs crowd the pure feast.\nKingfisher curtains lowered,\nPearl blinds rolled up,\nJoyous auspicious clouds displayed.\nIce-cold, the sky vast,\nWind clear, moon bright,\nRevealing the original face.\nPerfect emptiness expands,\nUnobstructed spiritual powers,\nScattering through the great void.\n\n**II: Snail-Horn Merit, Fly-Head Profit**\n\nSnail-horn merit,\nFly-head profit,\nSwept away with a sigh.\nWith a flick of the hand, wielding the blade,\nCleaving open the pass’s essentials,\nWithin, the mysterious origin revealed.\nDelusive clouds crumble,\nZen’s heaven glistens like ice,\nInstantly the moon shines, winds sway.\nStamping a thousand streams,\nGreen waters limpid,\nUniversally bathing in one luminous vessel.\nStanding alone, resolute,\nA model of perfect fusion,\nNear and far, undisturbed in oneness.\nComing and going distinctly,\nAll dualities dissolved,\nAuspicious signs of the yang soul appear.\nThe cool other shore,\nA wondrous, lively craft,\nSitting beyond, jade flowers gracefully bloom.\nTowering, attaining\nThe flawless merit’s completion,\nThe saint’s mechanism fully realized.\n\n**III: The Wisdom Sword’s Unyielding Edge**\n\nThe wisdom sword’s unyielding edge,\nA hundred demons swept away,\nTerrifying hearts and gall.\nFierce tigers captured alive,\nFlood dragons seized in hand,\nUnleashing awe-inspiring
