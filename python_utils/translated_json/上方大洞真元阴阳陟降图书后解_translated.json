  "full_translation": "**Post-Explication of the *Chart of the Supreme Cavern’s True Primordial Yin-Yang Ascent and Descent***\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Supreme Cavern’s True Primordial Yin-Yang Ascent and Descent Chart: A Further Explication*\n**Author:** Unknown\nTwo chapters, bound as one scroll.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Category of Numinous Charts*\n\n---\n\n**Post-Explication of the *Chart of the Supreme Cavern’s True Primordial Yin-Yang Ascent and Descent***\n\nHow vast! Qian and Kun are the great sovereign lords of the four seasons; Fu and Shen are the lesser parents of the myriad things. Thus, Qian begins its generation at *zi* and Kan concludes at *yin*; Kun first brings forth at *wu* and Li completes at *shen*—this accords with the celestial seasons.\n\nFrom *zi* to *si*, yang hardens and takes action; from *wu* to *hai*, yin lies horizontally and abides. From this, we know that among all things under heaven, there is not one that does not possess yin and yang. Moreover, the mutual resonance of yin and yang is the natural Dao.\n\nIt is also said: *zi*, *yin*, *chen*, *wu*, *shen*, and *xu* are the yang of Qian; *wei*, *si*, *chou*, *hai*, and *you* are the yin of Kun. Yang propels the Five Fortunes outward—\"outward\" like the land. The Five Fortunes are longevity, wealth, health, tranquility, and a virtuous end to one’s mandate. Thus, yang is auspicious and ascends with the Five Fortunes. Yin conceals the Six Calamities and descends—\"descends\" meaning downward. The Six Calamities are misfortune, premature death, fracture, illness, sorrow, and poverty—weakness and evil. Thus, yin is inauspicious and retreats with the Six Calamities.\n\nNow, yin and yang are things that seek one another. Therefore, the exalted is the position of yang, and the lowly is the position of yin. It is also said: yang is the noble person, yin the petty person. Sometimes drumming, sometimes ceasing; sometimes weeping, sometimes singing—the emotions of the petty person are exhausted therein. At times, the foolish below may harm the noble person. When the noble person’s mandate has not yet come to fruition and contends with them by force, this leads to obstruction and inextricable entanglement.\n\nSince ancient times, noble persons who could not bear the petty and thus incurred disaster have been many. When the noble person knows there is nothing to be done, they say: \"Only through defilement and humiliation, through lowliness, is the Dao honored.\" Thus, they humble their words, conceal their traces, act without contention. In this way, they ultimately avoid the blame of petty persons.\n\n*Xunzi* says: \"That which follows its kind is called fortune; that which opposes its kind is called misfortune.\" *Guan Yinzi* states: \"Do not slight petty persons, for petty persons can harm the state. Only when one can harmonize with petty persons can one align with great persons.\" The great person is one whose virtue matches heaven and earth.\n\nAll that is received in life and destiny arises from the endowment of yin and yang in a person. The tortoise hides within the sea, the White Prime frolics in repose; water descends, fire remains external—after nine years, great completion is achieved. Taking the sun and moon as the model for the *Yi*, that which employs the One without separation is none other than Kan not departing from fire. As with humanity: having crossed, one is born; not yet crossed, one ends.\n\nIn the ancient creation of characters, the crooked river of yin’s feminine *qi* of the One could grant long life to people, but it necessarily relied on the fire of the solar palace and the water of the lunar mansion, uniting with the crooked river of yang’s masculine crystal of the One. Thus, the One is born from the Two, and the Three Primes are completed—namely, the Primordial of Qian, the Primordial of Kun, and the Primordial of Humanity. Humanity models itself on the Two Modes to align with the Dao.\n\nGao Xiangxian’s song says:\n*\"Have you not seen Shu Tong serving under Wei Boyang? Together they laughed and entered the land of nothingness. Following the* Lianshan*, they composed the* Cantongqi*, leaving it as the eternal king of elixirs.\"*\nThe *Lianshan* was the original name of the *Yi*.\n\nIt also says:\n*\"The sun is Li, the moon is Kan; sun and moon as the* Yi *devour one another. When the golden crow dies, the jade hare is born—all things arise from the resonance of heaven and earth.\"*\nThe *Yi* states: \"Heaven and earth intermingle, and the myriad things transform into harmony\"—does this not refer to this?\n\nThe *Rites* say: \"Only when heaven and earth unite do the myriad things flourish.\" The *Commentary* states: \"Yin alone does not generate; yang alone does not generate; heaven alone does not generate. Only when the three unite is generation achieved.\"\n\nThe *Book* says: \"The Dao has ascent and descent; only the perfected person models this.\" Thus, the purport of the *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Great Cavern* is: \"Above, open the gate of immortality; below, seal the pass of death. The White Emperor of the Western Flower is the one who gives birth to my spirit.\"\n\nMeng Juexian, enlightened by the Dao of embracing the One, said:\nFirst: \"Embody yin and yang within the indistinct and imperceptible; discern movement and stillness within the subtle and profound.\"\nSecond: \"Spirit is stored in the Celestial Valley; *qi* flows into the Cinnabar Prime.\"\nThird: \"When fire is kindled, it burns away all impurities; when water flows, it aids the hundred passes.\"\n\nHow fitting! Yet those who discourse on the surpassing subtleties of yin and yang’s alternation may find it daunting. Little do they know that the myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonizing through the *qi* of the center—this is acceptable.\n\nOnly by advancing in the Dao can one attain distant equality; if one acts as a human should, one can receive luminous blessings. Thus, when Jizi sought long life, he marked the first unfolding of the Five Fortunes, aspiring to tortoise-like longevity and ranking among the Three Joys. What in the human realm is more precious than this?\n\nThe only concern is that cultivators cannot revere their *qi*, honor their form, preserve their life, and cherish their spirit. Alas, this is self-inflicted ruin!\n\n---\n\n**Chart of the Four Images**\n\nHow towering and great! Heaven and earth do not speak, yet the four seasons proceed, and the hundred things are born. Do not all things sprout in spring, grow in summer, ripen in autumn, and store in winter?\n\nThus, the *Yi* says: \"The myriad things emerge from Zhen\"—Zhen is the east. \"They are ordered by Xun\"—Xun is the southeast. \"Ordered\" means the myriad things are pure and aligned. \"Li is brightness\"—all things become visible; it is the trigram of the south. \"Kun is earth\"—all things receive nourishment therein. Thus, it is said: \"They are employed by Kun.\"\n\n**Dui is the true autumn**, where all things find joy—thus it is said: \"Joy is spoken of in Dui.\" **They contend in Qian**—Qian is the trigram of the northwest, signifying the struggle of yin and yang. **Kan is water**, the trigram of the true north, the trigram of toil, where all things return—thus it is said: \"Toil is in Kan.\" **Gen is the trigram of the northeast**, where all things reach their completion and begin anew—thus it is said: \"Completion is spoken of in Gen.\"\n\nTherefore, the ancient sages, attuned to the proper seasons of things, nourished and enriched the world, so that the multitudes never lacked. They harmonized with the sequence of the four seasons.\n\nTo speak of the east is to speak of spring—*chun* (spring) means *chun* (stirring), for it brings forth the myriad things; this is sageliness. The south is summer—*xia* (summer) means *jia* (provision), for it nurtures, fosters, and sustains; this is benevolence. The west is autumn—*qiu* (autumn) means *chou* (sorrow), for in autumn, things are examined and guarded in due season; this is righteousness. The north is winter—*dong* (winter) means *zhong* (center), and *zhong* means *cang* (concealment).\n\nThe *Records* say: \"The Dao takes the four seasons as its handle, and thus affairs may be encouraged.\" The *Music* says: \"Spring creates, summer grows—this is benevolence; autumn gathers, winter stores—this is righteousness.\" Only the true person can align with these seasons through benevolence, righteousness, and the Dao.\n\nThus, the true person, hands clasped behind, sings:\n*The four seasons, how vast!*\n*The single qi, how boundless!*\n*The sage, how radiant!*\n\n---\n\n**Chart of the Five Phases’ Transitions**\n\nThe Viscount of Ji said: \"Heaven bestowed upon Yu the *Hong Fan*’s Nine Categories, the first of which is the Five Phases.\" The saying that \"Heaven One generates water, Earth Two generates fire, Heaven Three generates wood, Earth Four generates metal, Heaven Five generates earth\" refers to the generative numbers of the Five Phases. The subsequent sequence—water as six, fire as seven, wood as eight, metal as nine, earth as ten—are the completion numbers of the Five Phases.\n\nFurther, it is said: From the Beginning of Spring, wood reigns; from the Beginning of Summer, fire reigns; from the Beginning of Autumn, metal reigns; from the Beginning of Winter, water reigns—each for seventy-two days. At the end of each of the four seasons, earth reigns for eighteen days. This is what is meant by the reigning and ministering of the Five Phases.\n\nAgain, it is said: \"Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water\"—this is called the mutual generation of the Five Phases. There is also the saying: \"Water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood, wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water\"—this is called the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases.\n\nOnly heaven generates the four seasons and Five Phases, and the sages named them. Of all things that fill heaven and earth, the greatest and most numerous are the Five Phases. In their application to humanity, without these five, life cannot be sustained, and the absence of even one is impossible.\n\nThe *Rites* say: \"The Five Phases form the essence, and thus affairs may be restored.\" Only those who possess the Dao delve into the source of the single qi and master the laws of the Five Phases’ transitions. If one internally loses the rectitude of the Three Origins and externally chases the depravity of the Nine Orifices, death will surely come—how true are these words!\n\nThe song says:\n*Great are the Five Phases!*\n*In their relation to humanity,*\n*Used with the Dao, they bring prosperity;*\n*Without the Dao, they bring peril.*\n\nAs for the principles of this text, they originate from the teachings of the Perfected One of Upright Yang:\n*Rushing forth, the great Dao roams the heavens,*\n*Pulling the three carts with sixteen oxen.*\n*The Four Images and Five Phases gather in a single grasp,*\n*Then comes the drawing of sinews and the changing of bones.*\n\n---\n\n**Chart of the Eight Trigrams’ Six Changes**\n\nThe trigrams of the *Yi* model the functions of heaven and earth. **Above, Qian is heaven**—Qian above is heaven, in humanity it is the head, and below it is earth. **Below, Kun is earth**—Kun above is heaven, in humanity it is the abdomen, and below it is Kun. **Qian and Kun are the root of heaven and earth**, the great parents of yin, yang, and the myriad things.\n\n**Kan in heaven is the moon**, in humanity it is the ears, and on earth it is water. **Li in heaven is the sun**, in humanity it is the eyes, and on earth it is fire. Thus, the immortals use Qian and Kun as the cauldron and metal, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, so that the qi of heaven and earth, yin and yang, intermingle and harmonize, and the myriad things are born and completed in unobstructed prosperity. *Tai* (prosperity) means \"unobstructed.\"\n\nThus, when heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends—this is called *Jiji* (Completion). Fire flames upward and water moistens downward, yet when water is above fire, it does not lose its nature. With reason thus perfectly balanced and affairs fully accomplished, the great work of the world is complete.\n\nIf one acts during the time of *Jiji*, one must be as cautious as if treading on thin ice. When heaven and earth enclose and communicate in prosperity, the four seasons enclose their spiritual qi—is this not the Dao? When Kan and Li unite in *Jiji*, the hundred things complete their forms and settle their bodies.\n\nMaster Azure Mist instructed the Daoist:\n*Have you not seen the bricks at the kiln’s head,*\n*Broken by rain as they lie?*\n*They have never endured water and fire.*\n*But if water and fire fire them into tiles,*\n*They will remain in the world for ten thousand years.*\n\nThe heartless clay vessel, once subjected to the completion of water and fire, becomes firm and indestructible—how much more should the cultivator of truth seek long life?\n\nFurthermore, it is said: **Zhen is the feet**, **Xun is the thighs**, **Gen is the mountain and the hands**, and also the nose. The nose is the mountain of the face. The nose opens like the mouth, and mouth and nose communicate qi—thus, mountains and marshes communicate qi. Next, **Dui is the marsh and the mouth**.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor received the oral instructions of the Heavenly True Sovereign at Mount Jing, where he cast a tripod. The tripod’s three legs represented essence, qi, and spirit, sufficient to ascend the clouds. The scriptures say: \"When the primordial qi is refined and transformed, one becomes an immortal.\" The secret of ascending in flight lies in the *Guicang*.\n\nThe six changes refer to Qian progressing from the first yang to the ninth yang, and Kun from the first yin to the sixth yin. Whether there is change or no change in the middle, the time is in the correct yang number of heaven. Observing the multitude of trigrams, it is ever thus.\n\nLong ago, when the dragon emerged from the River, the eight trigrams revealed their images; when the qilin was wounded in the marsh, the Ten Wings manifested their functions. The Master sang: *\"In the age of Tang and Yu, the qilin and phoenix roamed—now, out of time, what do they seek? O qilin, qilin, my heart is heavy.\"* Moreover, when the noble one meets his time, he mounts his chariot; when he does not, he drifts like tumbleweed. The Fisherman sang: *\"When the waters of Canglang are clear, they may wash my cap strings; when they are turbid, they may wash my feet.\"* Thus, to know advance and retreat, life and death, yet never lose one’s correctness—this belongs only to the sage. Yet one must adapt to the world’s gains and losses, fullness and emptiness, moving with the times. *The Model Sayings* states: *\"The sage is keen of perception, profound in wisdom, inheriting heaven and measuring the numinous, surpassing all mortals, weaving the patterns of all norms.\"*\n\n**The Nine Palaces and Seven Primordials Diagram**\nHow wise were the ancients! The historians’ eulogies say: *\"The River Chart ordained Fu Xi; the Luo Writing bestowed Yu.\"* It tells how Fu Xi first drew the dragon-horse bearing the River Chart, thereby manifesting the eight trigrams. Yu was granted the dark jade tablet, and the turtle-script emerged from the Luo River, whence he unfolded the Nine Categories, detailing the numbers of the nine palaces. Thus: the sixth palace is Qian, the first palace Kan, the eighth palace Gen, the third palace Zhen, the fourth palace Xun, the ninth palace Li, the second palace Kun, the seventh palace Dui, and the central palace is five.\n\nNext, regarding the colors of the nine palaces: only black must not be violated. For green-blue governs sores and ulcers, while red and yellow still arise from sorrow and illness. Observing the Way of Great Simplicity, only white is the beneficial direction. Each year and month, its pattern is greatly clarified—all is recorded in the annotated almanac, shifting through the flying stars.\n\nSome say of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordials: they illuminate the year-white, month-white, and day-white, the Way of the three yangs and three yins. Further: the Three Primordials arise from the heavenly numbers twenty-five—one, three, five, seven, nine—and the earthly numbers thirty—two, four, six, eight, ten. In total, fifty-five; subtracting the earth’s terminal number ten, forty-five remain, which are the Heavenly Primordial, Human Primordial, and Earthly Primordial. Thus, the fifteen in crosswise and lengthwise arrangement are wondrous beyond measure.\n\nMoreover, as heaven and earth generate the myriad things, only the Human Primordial aligns with the reckoning of the nine palaces, situated between the Heavenly Primordial and Earthly Primordial. With this body so hard to obtain, how can one not diligently advance in the Way? Would that not be perverse?\n\nMaster Xiyi’s Exegetical Discourse:\n\nThe Dao of mercury-taming and cinnabar-subduing lies wholly in the left three and the right seven, with two and four as the shoulders, six and eight as the knees and feet, nine worn as the crown, one trodden as the sole. The five palaces of the abdomen are made august when the auspicious center is duly occupied; the merit covers the eight directions, and the wondrous work is completed through the Three Primordials. Thus the River Chart and the Luo Writing were emulated by the sages.\n\nNow the graph for Dao in ancient script combines “primordial” and “head,” signifying the origin of all dharmas and the chief of all sages. The graph for virtue combines “upright” and “heart,” denoting an upright heart and the contemplation of emptiness and forgetfulness. To enlighten the guilty and illumined, to accord with the Great Principle—this is the Dao of the Former Masters. To achieve the inner elixir of reverted cinnabar and preserve the accomplishment without loss—this is the virtue of the superior adept.\n\nApplied to governing the state, it brings profound peace; applied to cultivating the self, it attains enduring existence. Such is the ultimate attainment—is it not sublime?\n\nEmperor Ming of Tang esteemed the *Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries and the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, the *Book of Changes*, and the *True Scripture of the Southern Florescence* as the Three Profound Studies—was this not fitting?\n\n**Illustrated Charts of Immortal Cultivation and Elixir Refinement**\n\nHow strange! Man’s sojourn between heaven and earth—even if granted a full century—passes like a horse galloping past a crack. Those who fail to nurture their allotted span—alas!\n\nThe Perfected, however, are otherwise: they constantly establish fasts and set up jiao rites, and repeatedly bestow alms to succor the multitude. Thus they cultivate the Dao to instruct others, clarify sincerity to serve their masters. The Corpse Perfected, virtuous and attuned to the divine, and the superior adept, wondrously attaining heaven—are not these the fruits of learning immortality and refining the form?\n\nWhenever one sits to advance in the Great Cavern’s Dao, the eight directions of heaven and earth, the sun, moon, and stars, and the primordial qi of the Orthodox Unity descend, flowing into the adept’s bodily palaces. The four seasonal qi—spring’s warmth, summer’s heat, autumn’s chill, winter’s cold—respond without speech and arrive unbidden.\n\nThus, returning the celestial qi to govern the earthly form, one finds auspicious clouds unfolding at the Gate of Life and propitious mists sealing the Portal of Death. Thereupon the flying mystery’s essence descends to stabilize the Crimson Palace of the Mud Pill in the human body, harmonizing the five qi and blending the hundred spirits. After ten revolutions of the numinous, the myriad qi ascend together as immortals.\n\nThe immortal Dao treasures life and delivers boundless beings. Fortunate is the embodied one who receives deliverance, enduring through kalpas, attaining the wondrous Dao, and earning the title of Perfected.\n\nThe Perfected who embodies the Dao, with lofty influence circulating through the world, comprehends the myriad things, and wields spirit without limit. The noble person is likewise.\n\nThe noble person’s Dao consists in reverence, respect, kindness, and righteousness. It values guarding the feminine, embracing disgrace, enduring defilement, and receiving filth—this is the model of the highest wisdom, yet the common people constantly invert it.\n\nThus the fully virtuous act upon perceiving the moment, not waiting for the day’s end. When the time is to stop, they stop; when the time is to act, they act. Their emergence and withdrawal always accord with the moment, their conduct and concealment never contravene adaptation. Advancing, they universally aid the world; retreating, they singularly perfect themselves.\n\nThe perspicacious of antiquity were ever engaged in this—who was it? None other than Master Meng of Zhuang.\n\nWhen the King of Chu marched on a distant campaign, his banner trailed in the mud like a turtle’s tail; the Prime Minister of Liang flew into a rage, and thus faced the mockery of a rotten rat. How worthy was Yanzi, content with a single bamboo basket of food in his humble alley. How sagely was Master Kong, resting his head on his arm to drink plain water. Xu You delighted in the Dao by the banks of the Ying, while Bing Bo realized his ambition at Gongshou. These were all talents who transcended the mundane, scholars devoted to the profound.\n\nThus the superior person aligns with the Dao, and heaven equally comes to assist. The great Dao lies vast and unobstructed, not far from the self—cultivate it within, and one’s virtue becomes true. As jade uncut will not become a vessel, so too a person unlearned will not know the Dao.\n\nThe *Rites* states: \"The great Dao is not a vessel.\" Here, the nine palaces disperse: Li in the second, Kun in the second, Dui in the seventh, and the central palace, five, is Si. Next, the nine palaces and their corresponding colors—only black must not be violated. For green-blue governs sores and ulcers, while red and yellow still arise from worry and illness. Observing the Dao of the Great Simplicity, only white is the beneficial direction. Each year and month, its pattern shines resplendent. All is recorded in annotated almanacs, shifting and flying through the calculations.\n\nSome say of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Yuan: they illuminate the year’s white, the month’s white, and the day’s white—the Dao of the three yang and three yin. Further, the three Yuan: the celestial numbers are twenty-five—one, three, five, seven, nine. The terrestrial numbers are thirty—two, four, six, eight, ten. In total, fifty-five; subtracting the ten terminal numbers of earth, forty-five remain—these are the Heavenly Yuan, Human Yuan, and Earthly Yuan. Thus, in all directions, fifteenfold, its subtlety is immeasurable.\n\nMoreover, as heaven and earth generate the myriad things, only the Human Yuan corresponds to the nine palaces’ reckoning, situated between the Heavenly Yuan and Earthly Yuan. With this rare and precious body, how could one not strive to advance in the Dao? Would that not be perverse?\n\nThe Recluse of Mystery and Silence states: The Dao of refining mercury and subduing cinnabar lies entirely in \"three on the left and seven on the right.\" Two and four serve as the shoulders, six and eight as the knees and feet. Nine is worn upon the head, one is trodden beneath the feet. The five palaces of the abdomen are ruled by the Yellow Court, with the auspicious arrival at the center completing the square. Its merit spans the eight directions, its wondrous function perfected through the Three Yuan.\n\nThus, the *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture* were emulated by the sages. The ancient character for *Dao* combines *yuan* (origin) and *shou* (head), signifying the origin of all dharmas and the foremost of all sages. The character for *virtue* combines *zhi* (upright) and *xin* (heart), denoting an upright heart and the contemplation of emptiness and forgetfulness. To guide the guilty and enlighten the ignorant, aligning with the Great Principle—this is the Dao of the Former Masters. To attain the inner elixir and preserve one’s achievement without loss—this is the virtue of the superior adept.\n\nApplied to governing the state, it brings profound peace; applied to cultivating the self, it leads to enduring existence. Such attainment is the ultimate—is it not sublime?\n\nEmperor Ming of Tang regarded the *True Scripture of Penetrating Mystery and the Dao and Its Virtue*, the *Book of Changes*, and the *True Scripture of the Southern Florescence* as the Three Profound Studies—was this not fitting?\n\n**Illustrated Charts of Immortal Cultivation and Elixir Refinement**\nHow extraordinary! For one born between heaven and earth, even if granted a lifespan of a hundred years, it passes like a horse galloping past a crack. How lamentable that most cannot nurture their allotted years!\n\nYet the perfected ones differ. Through constant purification rites and offerings, and repeated acts of generosity to aid the multitude, they cultivate the Dao to instruct others, illuminating sincerity in reverence for their masters. The corpse-like perfected ones, through virtue, commune with the divine; the superior adepts, through subtlety, ascend to heaven. How could those who do not study immortality and refine their forms achieve this?\n\nWhenever one sits to advance in the Great Cavern’s Dao, they immediately sense the eight directions of heaven and earth, the descent of the primordial qi of the sun, moon, and stars into the palaces of their body. The four seasonal qi—spring’s warmth, summer’s heat, autumn’s chill, winter’s cold—respond without speech and arrive without summons.\n\nThus, the qi of the upper heavens is used to govern the form of the great earth. Auspicious clouds open at the Gate of Life, while propitious mists seal the Portal of Death. Then, the luminous essence of soaring mystery descends to guard the Crimson Palace of the Mud Pill in the human body, harmonizing the five qi and uniting the hundred spirits. After ten revolutions of the numinous, the myriad qi coalesce into immortality.\n\nThe immortal Dao values life and delivers boundless beings. Fortunate is the one who receives deliverance in this life, attaining eternal existence through the eons, partaking in the wondrous Dao, and earning the title of Perfected One.\n\nThe Perfected One embodies the Dao, their noble influence shaping the world, their knowledge encompassing the myriad things, their spiritual efficacy boundless. The noble person is likewise.\n\nThe Dao of the noble person lies in reverence, respect, kindness, and righteousness. It values guarding the feminine, enduring humiliation, and embracing impurity—this is the model of the highest wisdom, though the common people often reverse it. Thus, those who preserve virtue act when they perceive the moment, without waiting for the day’s end. They stop when it is time to stop, proceed when it is time to proceed. Their actions and withdrawals always align with the moment, their conduct never conflicting with adaptability. In advancement, they benefit the world; in retreat, they perfect themselves.\n\nThe accomplished scholars of antiquity constantly pursued this—who else but Master Zhuang?\n\nWhen the King of Chu marched on a distant campaign, dragging the tails of mud-laden tortoises; when the Prime Minister of Liang seethed with rage, thus enduring the mockery of a rotten rat—how worthy was Yanzi, content with a single basket of food in his humble alley! How sagely was Confucius, resting his arm as a pillow to drink plain water! Xu You delighted in the Dao by the banks of the Ying; Bing Bo found his ambition at Gongshou. These were all talents transcending the mundane, scholars devoted to the profound.\n\nThus, the superior person who aligns with the Dao receives celestial aid as naturally as the heavens turn. The great Dao lies vast and unobstructed, never far from the self; cultivate it within, and one’s virtue becomes true. As jade must be carved to become an instrument, so must a person study to comprehend the Dao. The *Rites* states: \"The great Dao is not confined to any vessel,\" for it resides everywhere.\n\nMoreover, the golden scriptures impart this teaching: if one cherishes the body, preserves the spirit, values the qi, and secures the root, the form shall not decay in death, and in the end, one may ascend in flight—can this not be called immortality?\n\nThe charts of the Golden Gates in the celestial court make it clear: the heavenly net ensnares all. For the gravest transgressions, how could curses suffice? For the rarest of sins, how could punishment be light? Yet the radiance of Heaven and Earth, of Qian and Kun, depends solely on conduct and merit.\n\nThe enlightened adepts of antiquity all accumulated the merit of emptying the heart and refining the true, then amassed deeds of aiding the state and saving the people. As for those who mastered qi and embraced non-action, they ascended to the ranks of the immortals—necessarily through wisdom vast and methods extraordinary, distinct from the common crowd. Thus, they attained the wondrous union of form and spirit, partaking in the rites of the primordial essence.\n\nIt is told that on Mount Wei, which never turns back, Prince Jin played his flute and ascended to the Silver River; by the Liao River, which flows but once, Lord Ding transformed into a crane and soared into the azure heavens. Thereafter, he revealed his song:\n*\"Ding Lingwei, transformed into a crane, returns after a thousand years—*\n*the city walls remain, but the people are gone.*\n*Why not study immortality? The tombs lie heaped in mounds.\"*\n\nLater, the cypress and juniper of Zhaozhou all became Buddhas; Master Xu’s chickens and dogs all ascended as immortals. The scholar of Wu, in his *ci* verses, wrote:\n*\"Behold the youthful face, the preserved locks,*\n*soaring in flight, controlling the shadow—*\n*bowing to the imperial summons of Jingyang.\"*\n\nThe recluses say: *\"How magnificent is the empty-hearted Master Pang!*\n*How wondrous is the life-mastering Lord Xu!*\n*Their entire families ascended together into the azure clouds.\"*\n\nAh! The forest winds sigh, the mountain streams murmur. Plum and bamboo rustle; the phoenix sings beyond the emerald firmament. Pines stand in solemn rows; the crane calls amid the white clouds. Then the imperial carriage, adorned with feathers, emerges from being and enters non-being. I, your servant, approach the imperial capital, awaiting commands at the jeweled palace—all this is the result of reverently serving the true and primordial essence of the Great Cavern.\n\nIt is said: *\"Bright, bright is the High Heaven,*\n*illuminating the earth below.*\n*When a person’s merit is complete and virtue perfected,*\n*they leave the dust of the mortal world,*\n*ride the auspicious mist,*\n*and pay homage at the gates of the Great Clarity.\"*\n\nHere ends the explanation of the *Chart of Ascent and Descent of the True and Primordial Yin-Yang of the Great Cavern Above.*",

      "translated_text": "**Post-Explication of the *Chart of the Supreme Cavern’s True Primordial Yin-Yang Ascent and Descent***\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Supreme Cavern’s True Primordial Yin-Yang Ascent and Descent Chart: A Further Explication*\n**Author:** Unknown\nTwo chapters, bound as one scroll.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Category of Numinous Charts*\n\n---\n\n**Post-Explication of the *Chart of the Supreme Cavern’s True Primordial Yin-Yang Ascent and Descent***\n\nHow vast! Qian and Kun are the great sovereign lords of the four seasons; Fu and Shen are the lesser parents of the myriad things. Thus, Qian begins its generation at *zi* and Kan concludes at *yin*; Kun first brings forth at *wu* and Li completes at *shen*—this accords with the celestial seasons.\n\nFrom *zi* to *si*, yang hardens and takes action; from *wu* to *hai*, yin lies horizontally and abides. From this, we know that among all things under heaven, there is not one that does not possess yin and yang. Moreover, the mutual resonance of yin and yang is the natural Dao.\n\nIt is also said: *zi*, *yin*, *chen*, *wu*, *shen*, and *xu* are the yang of Qian; *wei*, *si*, *chou*, *hai*, and *you* are the yin of Kun. Yang propels the Five Fortunes outward—\"outward\" like the land. The Five Fortunes are longevity, wealth, health, tranquility, and a virtuous end to one’s mandate. Thus, yang is auspicious and ascends with the Five Fortunes. Yin conceals the Six Calamities and descends—\"descends\" meaning downward. The Six Calamities are misfortune, premature death, fracture, illness, sorrow, and poverty—weakness and evil. Thus, yin is inauspicious and retreats with the Six Calamities.\n\nNow, yin and yang are things that seek one another. Therefore, the exalted is the position of yang, and the lowly is the position of yin. It is also said: yang is the noble person, yin the petty person. Sometimes drumming, sometimes ceasing; sometimes weeping, sometimes singing—the emotions of the petty person are exhausted therein. At times, the foolish below may harm the noble person. When the noble person’s mandate has not yet come to fruition and contends with them by force, this leads to obstruction and inextricable entanglement.\n\nSince ancient times, noble persons who could not bear the petty and thus incurred disaster have been many. When the noble person knows there is nothing to be done, they say: \"Only through defilement and humiliation, through lowliness, is the Dao honored.\" Thus, they humble their words, conceal their traces, act without contention. In this way, they ultimately avoid the blame of petty persons.\n\n*Xunzi* says: \"That which follows its kind is called fortune; that which opposes its kind is called misfortune.\" *Guan Yinzi* states: \"Do not slight petty persons, for petty persons can harm the state. Only when one can harmonize with petty persons can one align with great persons.\" The great person is one whose virtue matches heaven and earth.\n\nAll that is received in life and destiny arises from the endowment of yin and yang in a person. The tortoise hides within the sea, the White Prime frolics in repose; water descends, fire remains external—after nine years, great completion is achieved. Taking the sun and moon as the model for the *Yi*, that which employs the One without separation is none other than Kan not departing from fire. As with humanity: having crossed, one is born; not yet crossed, one ends.\n\nIn the ancient creation of characters, the crooked river of yin’s feminine *qi* of the One could grant long life to people, but it necessarily relied on the fire of the solar palace and the water of the lunar mansion, uniting with the crooked river of yang’s masculine crystal of the One. Thus, the One is born from the Two, and the Three Primes are completed—namely, the Primordial of Qian, the Primordial of Kun, and the Primordial of Humanity. Humanity models itself on the Two Modes to align with the Dao.\n\nGao Xiangxian’s song says:\n*\"Have you not seen Shu Tong serving under Wei Boyang? Together they laughed and entered the land of nothingness. Following the* Lianshan*, they composed the* Cantongqi*, leaving it as the eternal king of elixirs.\"*\nThe *Lianshan* was the original name of the *Yi*.\n\nIt also says:\n*\"The sun is Li, the moon is Kan; sun and moon as the* Yi *devour one another. When the golden crow dies, the jade hare is born—all things arise from the resonance of heaven and earth.\"*\nThe *Yi* states: \"Heaven and earth intermingle, and the myriad things transform into harmony\"—does this not refer to this?\n\nThe *Rites* say: \"Only when heaven and earth unite do the myriad things flourish.\" The *Commentary* states: \"Yin alone does not generate; yang alone does not generate; heaven alone does not generate. Only when the three unite is generation achieved.\"\n\nThe *Book* says: \"The Dao has ascent and descent; only the perfected person models this.\" Thus, the purport of the *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Great Cavern* is: \"Above, open the gate of immortality; below, seal the pass of death. The White Emperor of the Western Flower is the one who gives birth to my spirit.\"\n\nMeng Juexian, enlightened by the Dao of embracing the One, said:\nFirst: \"Embody yin and yang within the indistinct and imperceptible; discern movement and stillness within the subtle and profound.\"\nSecond: \"Spirit is stored in the Celestial Valley; *qi* flows into the Cinnabar Prime.\"\nThird: \"When fire is kindled, it burns away all impurities; when water flows, it aids the hundred passes.\"\n\nHow fitting! Yet those who discourse on the surpassing subtleties of yin and yang’s alternation may find it daunting. Little do they know that the myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, harmonizing through the *qi* of the center—this is acceptable.\n\nOnly by advancing in the Dao can one attain distant equality; if one acts as a human should, one can receive luminous blessings. Thus, when Jizi sought long life, he marked the first unfolding of the Five Fortunes, aspiring to tortoise-like longevity and ranking among the Three Joys. What in the human realm is more precious than this?\n\nThe only concern is that cultivators cannot revere their *qi*, honor their form, preserve their life, and cherish their spirit. Alas, this is self-inflicted ruin!\n\n---\n\n**Chart of the Four Images**\n\nHow towering and great! Heaven and earth do not speak, yet the four seasons proceed, and the hundred things are born. Do not all things sprout in spring, grow in summer, ripen in autumn, and store in winter?\n\nThus, the *Yi* says: \"The myriad things emerge from Zhen\"—Zhen is the east. \"They are ordered by Xun\"—Xun is the southeast. \"Ordered\" means the myriad things are pure and aligned. \"Li is brightness\"—all things become visible; it is the trigram of the south. \"Kun is earth\"—all things receive nourishment therein. Thus, it is said: \"They are employed by Kun.\"",

      "original_text": "兑，正秋也，万物之所说也，故曰说言乎兑。 战乎乾，乾，西北之卦也，言阴阳之相薄也。 坎者，水也，正北方之卦也，劳卦也，万物之所归也，故曰：劳乎坎。 艮，东北之卦也，万物之所成终，而所成始也，故曰成言乎艮。 是以前圣资物之宜，膏润天下，兆民罔乏矣，而与四时合其序。 言东方者春，春之为言蠢也，产万物者，圣也。 南方者夏，夏之为言假也，养之长之假之，仁也。 西方者秋，秋之为言愁也，秋之以时察守，义者也。 北方者冬，冬之为言中也，中者藏也。 《记》云：道以四时为柄，故事可劝也。 《乐》云：春作夏长，仁也； 秋敛冬藏，义也。 盖由仁义道德者，其惟真人能如期。 是故真人负手而歌曰：四时其巨然，一气其浩然，圣者其昭然。 五行推移之图 箕子有言曰：天乃锡禹，《洪范》九畴，初一曰五行。 所为天一生水，地二生火，天三生木，地四生金，天五生土者，乃五行之生数耶。 其次伪：水数六，火数七，木数八，金数九，土数十者，为五行之成数矣。 又其次言：自立春木王，立夏火王，立秋金王，立冬水王，皆七十有二曰。 於四季月末，各取十有八曰，土王。 此之所为五行之王相已。 又其重言：水生木，木生火，火生土，土生金，金生水者，是名五行之相生然。 复有言：其水克火，火克金，金克木，木克土，土克水者，兹号五行之相克耳。 惟天生四时五行，圣人作之名焉。 言万物盈於天地之间，而其为物最大且多者，有五行矣。 其用於人也，非此五者不能以为生，而阙其一不可。 《礼》云：五行以为质，故事可复也。 惟有道者，推穷一气之源，迁徙五行之法。 若夫内失三元之正，外驰九窍之邪，盖昭然将死矣，亦其允言哉。 歌曰：大哉五行兮，之于其人兮，用之有道则昌兮，无道则殆。 而斯之文理，本正阳真人旨：奔开大道徧天游，牵动三车十六牛，四象五行一撮聚，更会抽筋换骨头。 八卦六变之图 易卦者，准天地之用。 上乾为天，言乾在上为天，在人为首，在下为地。 下坤为地，言坤在上为天，在人为腹，在下为坤。 乾坤者，天地之本，阴阳万物之大父母。 坎在天为月，在人为耳，在地为水。 离在天为日，在人为目，在地为火。 是故上仙以乾坤为鼎金，坎离为药物，则天地阴阳之气相交而和，其万物生成以为通泰。 泰者，通也。 故天地相合以降甘露，名日既济。 则火炎上而水润下，令水在火上，不失其性。 理既兼济，务得偕全，盖天下之能事毕矣。 若人因於既济之时，当畏慎如也。 故天地函而通泰，则四时函其神气道欤。 坎离交而既济，则百物成其形体定也。 青霞子示道人：君不见，窑头坏，随雨破，只是未曾经水火，若将水火烧成軏，留向人间千万年。 言无情瓦饭，因水火既济，犹坚而不毁，况修真之士，宁菲长生乎。 抑又言：其震为足，巽为股，艮为山为手，亦为鼻。 鼻者，面之山也。 鼻开似口，口鼻通气，故山泽通气是已。 次言：兑为泽为口。 昔者黄帝受天真皇人口诀，於荆山铸鼎，鼎分三足，所为精气神，足以登云霄。 经云：混化一气，练而变仙。 惟飞升之道，秘于《归藏》。 其六变者，言乾自初九之上九，坤从初六之上六。 或中有变无变，时在天阳正数，历观众卦，盖亦如之。",
      "translated_text": "**Dui is the true autumn**, where all things find joy—thus it is said: \"Joy is spoken of in Dui.\" **They contend in Qian**—Qian is the trigram of the northwest, signifying the struggle of yin and yang. **Kan is water**, the trigram of the true north, the trigram of toil, where all things return—thus it is said: \"Toil is in Kan.\" **Gen is the trigram of the northeast**, where all things reach their completion and begin anew—thus it is said: \"Completion is spoken of in Gen.\"\n\nTherefore, the ancient sages, attuned to the proper seasons of things, nourished and enriched the world, so that the multitudes never lacked. They harmonized with the sequence of the four seasons.\n\nTo speak of the east is to speak of spring—*chun* (spring) means *chun* (stirring), for it brings forth the myriad things; this is sageliness. The south is summer—*xia* (summer) means *jia* (provision), for it nurtures, fosters, and sustains; this is benevolence. The west is autumn—*qiu* (autumn) means *chou* (sorrow), for in autumn, things are examined and guarded in due season; this is righteousness. The north is winter—*dong* (winter) means *zhong* (center), and *zhong* means *cang* (concealment).\n\nThe *Records* say: \"The Dao takes the four seasons as its handle, and thus affairs may be encouraged.\" The *Music* says: \"Spring creates, summer grows—this is benevolence; autumn gathers, winter stores—this is righteousness.\" Only the true person can align with these seasons through benevolence, righteousness, and the Dao.\n\nThus, the true person, hands clasped behind, sings:\n*The four seasons, how vast!*\n*The single qi, how boundless!*\n*The sage, how radiant!*\n\n---\n\n**Chart of the Five Phases’ Transitions**\n\nThe Viscount of Ji said: \"Heaven bestowed upon Yu the *Hong Fan*’s Nine Categories, the first of which is the Five Phases.\" The saying that \"Heaven One generates water, Earth Two generates fire, Heaven Three generates wood, Earth Four generates metal, Heaven Five generates earth\" refers to the generative numbers of the Five Phases. The subsequent sequence—water as six, fire as seven, wood as eight, metal as nine, earth as ten—are the completion numbers of the Five Phases.\n\nFurther, it is said: From the Beginning of Spring, wood reigns; from the Beginning of Summer, fire reigns; from the Beginning of Autumn, metal reigns; from the Beginning of Winter, water reigns—each for seventy-two days. At the end of each of the four seasons, earth reigns for eighteen days. This is what is meant by the reigning and ministering of the Five Phases.\n\nAgain, it is said: \"Water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water\"—this is called the mutual generation of the Five Phases. There is also the saying: \"Water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood, wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water\"—this is called the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases.\n\nOnly heaven generates the four seasons and Five Phases, and the sages named them. Of all things that fill heaven and earth, the greatest and most numerous are the Five Phases. In their application to humanity, without these five, life cannot be sustained, and the absence of even one is impossible.\n\nThe *Rites* say: \"The Five Phases form the essence, and thus affairs may be restored.\" Only those who possess the Dao delve into the source of the single qi and master the laws of the Five Phases’ transitions. If one internally loses the rectitude of the Three Origins and externally chases the depravity of the Nine Orifices, death will surely come—how true are these words!\n\nThe song says:\n*Great are the Five Phases!*\n*In their relation to humanity,*\n*Used with the Dao, they bring prosperity;*\n*Without the Dao, they bring peril.*\n\nAs for the principles of this text, they originate from the teachings of the Perfected One of Upright Yang:\n*Rushing forth, the great Dao roams the heavens,*\n*Pulling the three carts with sixteen oxen.*\n*The Four Images and Five Phases gather in a single grasp,*\n*Then comes the drawing of sinews and the changing of bones.*\n\n---\n\n**Chart of the Eight Trigrams’ Six Changes**\n\nThe trigrams of the *Yi* model the functions of heaven and earth. **Above, Qian is heaven**—Qian above is heaven, in humanity it is the head, and below it is earth. **Below, Kun is earth**—Kun above is heaven, in humanity it is the abdomen, and below it is Kun. **Qian and Kun are the root of heaven and earth**, the great parents of yin, yang, and the myriad things.\n\n**Kan in heaven is the moon**, in humanity it is the ears, and on earth it is water. **Li in heaven is the sun**, in humanity it is the eyes, and on earth it is fire. Thus, the immortals use Qian and Kun as the cauldron and metal, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, so that the qi of heaven and earth, yin and yang, intermingle and harmonize, and the myriad things are born and completed in unobstructed prosperity. *Tai* (prosperity) means \"unobstructed.\"\n\nThus, when heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends—this is called *Jiji* (Completion). Fire flames upward and water moistens downward, yet when water is above fire, it does not lose its nature. With reason thus perfectly balanced and affairs fully accomplished, the great work of the world is complete.\n\nIf one acts during the time of *Jiji*, one must be as cautious as if treading on thin ice. When heaven and earth enclose and communicate in prosperity, the four seasons enclose their spiritual qi—is this not the Dao? When Kan and Li unite in *Jiji*, the hundred things complete their forms and settle their bodies.\n\nMaster Azure Mist instructed the Daoist:\n*Have you not seen the bricks at the kiln’s head,*\n*Broken by rain as they lie?*\n*They have never endured water and fire.*\n*But if water and fire fire them into tiles,*\n*They will remain in the world for ten thousand years.*\n\nThe heartless clay vessel, once subjected to the completion of water and fire, becomes firm and indestructible—how much more should the cultivator of truth seek long life?\n\nFurthermore, it is said: **Zhen is the feet**, **Xun is the thighs**, **Gen is the mountain and the hands**, and also the nose. The nose is the mountain of the face. The nose opens like the mouth, and mouth and nose communicate qi—thus, mountains and marshes communicate qi. Next, **Dui is the marsh and the mouth**.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor received the oral instructions of the Heavenly True Sovereign at Mount Jing, where he cast a tripod. The tripod’s three legs represented essence, qi, and spirit, sufficient to ascend the clouds. The scriptures say: \"When the primordial qi is refined and transformed, one becomes an immortal.\" The secret of ascending in flight lies in the *Guicang*.\n\nThe six changes refer to Qian progressing from the first yang to the ninth yang, and Kun from the first yin to the sixth yin. Whether there is change or no change in the middle, the time is in the correct yang number of heaven. Observing the multitude of trigrams, it is ever thus.",

      "translated_text": "Long ago, when the dragon emerged from the River, the eight trigrams revealed their images; when the qilin was wounded in the marsh, the Ten Wings manifested their functions. The Master sang: *\"In the age of Tang and Yu, the qilin and phoenix roamed—now, out of time, what do they seek? O qilin, qilin, my heart is heavy.\"* Moreover, when the noble one meets his time, he mounts his chariot; when he does not, he drifts like tumbleweed. The Fisherman sang: *\"When the waters of Canglang are clear, they may wash my cap strings; when they are turbid, they may wash my feet.\"* Thus, to know advance and retreat, life and death, yet never lose one’s correctness—this belongs only to the sage. Yet one must adapt to the world’s gains and losses, fullness and emptiness, moving with the times. *The Model Sayings* states: *\"The sage is keen of perception, profound in wisdom, inheriting heaven and measuring the numinous, surpassing all mortals, weaving the patterns of all norms.\"*\n\n**The Nine Palaces and Seven Primordials Diagram**\nHow wise were the ancients! The historians’ eulogies say: *\"The River Chart ordained Fu Xi; the Luo Writing bestowed Yu.\"* It tells how Fu Xi first drew the dragon-horse bearing the River Chart, thereby manifesting the eight trigrams. Yu was granted the dark jade tablet, and the turtle-script emerged from the Luo River, whence he unfolded the Nine Categories, detailing the numbers of the nine palaces. Thus: the sixth palace is Qian, the first palace Kan, the eighth palace Gen, the third palace Zhen, the fourth palace Xun, the ninth palace Li, the second palace Kun, the seventh palace Dui, and the central palace is five.\n\nNext, regarding the colors of the nine palaces: only black must not be violated. For green-blue governs sores and ulcers, while red and yellow still arise from sorrow and illness. Observing the Way of Great Simplicity, only white is the beneficial direction. Each year and month, its pattern is greatly clarified—all is recorded in the annotated almanac, shifting through the flying stars.\n\nSome say of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordials: they illuminate the year-white, month-white, and day-white, the Way of the three yangs and three yins. Further: the Three Primordials arise from the heavenly numbers twenty-five—one, three, five, seven, nine—and the earthly numbers thirty—two, four, six, eight, ten. In total, fifty-five; subtracting the earth’s terminal number ten, forty-five remain, which are the Heavenly Primordial, Human Primordial, and Earthly Primordial. Thus, the fifteen in crosswise and lengthwise arrangement are wondrous beyond measure.\n\nMoreover, as heaven and earth generate the myriad things, only the Human Primordial aligns with the reckoning of the nine palaces, situated between the Heavenly Primordial and Earthly Primordial. With this body so hard to obtain, how can one not diligently advance in the Way? Would that not be perverse?",

      "translated_text": "Master Xiyi’s Exegetical Discourse:\n\nThe Dao of mercury-taming and cinnabar-subduing lies wholly in the left three and the right seven, with two and four as the shoulders, six and eight as the knees and feet, nine worn as the crown, one trodden as the sole. The five palaces of the abdomen are made august when the auspicious center is duly occupied; the merit covers the eight directions, and the wondrous work is completed through the Three Primordials. Thus the River Chart and the Luo Writing were emulated by the sages.\n\nNow the graph for Dao in ancient script combines “primordial” and “head,” signifying the origin of all dharmas and the chief of all sages. The graph for virtue combines “upright” and “heart,” denoting an upright heart and the contemplation of emptiness and forgetfulness. To enlighten the guilty and illumined, to accord with the Great Principle—this is the Dao of the Former Masters. To achieve the inner elixir of reverted cinnabar and preserve the accomplishment without loss—this is the virtue of the superior adept.\n\nApplied to governing the state, it brings profound peace; applied to cultivating the self, it attains enduring existence. Such is the ultimate attainment—is it not sublime?\n\nEmperor Ming of Tang esteemed the *Scripture of Penetrating the Mysteries and the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*, the *Book of Changes*, and the *True Scripture of the Southern Florescence* as the Three Profound Studies—was this not fitting?\n\n**Illustrated Charts of Immortal Cultivation and Elixir Refinement**\n\nHow strange! Man’s sojourn between heaven and earth—even if granted a full century—passes like a horse galloping past a crack. Those who fail to nurture their allotted span—alas!\n\nThe Perfected, however, are otherwise: they constantly establish fasts and set up jiao rites, and repeatedly bestow alms to succor the multitude. Thus they cultivate the Dao to instruct others, clarify sincerity to serve their masters. The Corpse Perfected, virtuous and attuned to the divine, and the superior adept, wondrously attaining heaven—are not these the fruits of learning immortality and refining the form?\n\nWhenever one sits to advance in the Great Cavern’s Dao, the eight directions of heaven and earth, the sun, moon, and stars, and the primordial qi of the Orthodox Unity descend, flowing into the adept’s bodily palaces. The four seasonal qi—spring’s warmth, summer’s heat, autumn’s chill, winter’s cold—respond without speech and arrive unbidden.\n\nThus, returning the celestial qi to govern the earthly form, one finds auspicious clouds unfolding at the Gate of Life and propitious mists sealing the Portal of Death. Thereupon the flying mystery’s essence descends to stabilize the Crimson Palace of the Mud Pill in the human body, harmonizing the five qi and blending the hundred spirits. After ten revolutions of the numinous, the myriad qi ascend together as immortals.\n\nThe immortal Dao treasures life and delivers boundless beings. Fortunate is the embodied one who receives deliverance, enduring through kalpas, attaining the wondrous Dao, and earning the title of Perfected.\n\nThe Perfected who embodies the Dao, with lofty influence circulating through the world, comprehends the myriad things, and wields spirit without limit. The noble person is likewise.\n\nThe noble person’s Dao consists in reverence, respect, kindness, and righteousness. It values guarding the feminine, embracing disgrace, enduring defilement, and receiving filth—this is the model of the highest wisdom, yet the common people constantly invert it.\n\nThus the fully virtuous act upon perceiving the moment, not waiting for the day’s end. When the time is to stop, they stop; when the time is to act, they act. Their emergence and withdrawal always accord with the moment, their conduct and concealment never contravene adaptation. Advancing, they universally aid the world; retreating, they singularly perfect themselves.\n\nThe perspicacious of antiquity were ever engaged in this—who was it? None other than Master Meng of Zhuang.",
      "overlap_context": "number ten, forty-five remain, which are the Heavenly Primordial, Human Primordial, and Earthly Primordial. Thus, the fifteen in crosswise and lengthwise arrangement are wondrous beyond measure.\n\nMoreover, as heaven and earth generate the myriad things, only the Human Primordial aligns with the reckoning of the nine palaces, situated between the Heavenly Primordial and Earthly Primordial. With this body so hard to obtain, how can one not diligently advance in the Way? Would that not be perverse?",

      "translated_text": "When the King of Chu marched on a distant campaign, his banner trailed in the mud like a turtle’s tail; the Prime Minister of Liang flew into a rage, and thus faced the mockery of a rotten rat. How worthy was Yanzi, content with a single bamboo basket of food in his humble alley. How sagely was Master Kong, resting his head on his arm to drink plain water. Xu You delighted in the Dao by the banks of the Ying, while Bing Bo realized his ambition at Gongshou. These were all talents who transcended the mundane, scholars devoted to the profound.\n\nThus the superior person aligns with the Dao, and heaven equally comes to assist. The great Dao lies vast and unobstructed, not far from the self—cultivate it within, and one’s virtue becomes true. As jade uncut will not become a vessel, so too a person unlearned will not know the Dao.\n\nThe *Rites* states: \"The great Dao is not a vessel.\" Here, the nine palaces disperse: Li in the second, Kun in the second, Dui in the seventh, and the central palace, five, is Si. Next, the nine palaces and their corresponding colors—only black must not be violated. For green-blue governs sores and ulcers, while red and yellow still arise from worry and illness. Observing the Dao of the Great Simplicity, only white is the beneficial direction. Each year and month, its pattern shines resplendent. All is recorded in annotated almanacs, shifting and flying through the calculations.\n\nSome say of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Yuan: they illuminate the year’s white, the month’s white, and the day’s white—the Dao of the three yang and three yin. Further, the three Yuan: the celestial numbers are twenty-five—one, three, five, seven, nine. The terrestrial numbers are thirty—two, four, six, eight, ten. In total, fifty-five; subtracting the ten terminal numbers of earth, forty-five remain—these are the Heavenly Yuan, Human Yuan, and Earthly Yuan. Thus, in all directions, fifteenfold, its subtlety is immeasurable.\n\nMoreover, as heaven and earth generate the myriad things, only the Human Yuan corresponds to the nine palaces’ reckoning, situated between the Heavenly Yuan and Earthly Yuan.

How sagely was Confucius, resting his arm as a pillow to drink plain water! Xu You delighted in the Dao by the banks of the Ying; Bing Bo found his ambition at Gongshou. These were all talents transcending the mundane, scholars devoted to the profound.\n\nThus, the superior person who aligns with the Dao receives celestial aid as naturally as the heavens turn. The great Dao lies vast and unobstructed, never far from the self; cultivate it within, and one’s virtue becomes true. As jade must be carved to become an instrument, so must a person study to comprehend the Dao. The *Rites* states: \"The great Dao is not confined to any vessel,\" for it resides everywhere.\n\nMoreover, the golden scriptures impart this teaching: if one cherishes the body, preserves the spirit, values the qi, and secures the root, the form shall not decay in death, and in the end, one may ascend in flight—can this not be called immortality?\n\nThe charts of the Golden Gates in the celestial court make it clear: the heavenly net ensnares all. For the gravest transgressions, how could curses suffice? For the rarest of sins, how could punishment be light? Yet the radiance of Heaven and Earth, of Qian and Kun, depends solely on conduct and merit.\n\nThe enlightened adepts of antiquity all accumulated the merit of emptying the heart and refining the true, then amassed deeds of aiding the state and saving the people. As for those who mastered qi and embraced non-action, they ascended to the ranks of the immortals—necessarily through wisdom vast and methods extraordinary, distinct from the common crowd. Thus, they attained the wondrous union of form and spirit, partaking in the rites of the primordial essence.\n\nIt is told that on Mount Wei, which never turns back, Prince Jin played his flute and ascended to the Silver River; by the Liao River, which flows but once, Lord Ding transformed into a crane and soared into the azure heavens. Thereafter, he revealed his song:\n*\"Ding Lingwei, transformed into a crane, returns after a thousand years—*\n*the city walls remain, but the people are gone.*\n*Why not study immortality? The tombs lie heaped in mounds.\"*\n\nLater, the cypress and juniper of Zhaozhou all became Buddhas; Master Xu’s chickens and dogs all ascended as immortals. The scholar of Wu, in his *ci* verses, wrote:\n*\"Behold the youthful face, the preserved locks,*\n*soaring in flight, controlling the shadow—*\n*bowing to the imperial summons of Jingyang.\"*\n\nThe recluses say: *\"How magnificent is the empty-hearted Master Pang!*\n*How wondrous is the life-mastering Lord Xu!*\n*Their entire families ascended together into the azure clouds.\"*\n\nAh! The forest winds sigh, the mountain streams murmur. Plum and bamboo rustle; the phoenix sings beyond the emerald firmament. Pines stand in solemn rows; the crane calls amid the white clouds. Then the imperial carriage, adorned with feathers, emerges from being and enters non-being. I, your servant, approach the imperial capital, awaiting commands at the jeweled palace—all this is the result of reverently serving the true and primordial essence of the Great Cavern.\n\nIt is said: *\"Bright, bright is the High Heaven,*\n*illuminating the earth below.*\n*When a person’s merit is complete and virtue perfected,*\n*they leave the dust of the mortal world,*\n*ride the auspicious mist,*\n*and pay homage at the gates of the Great Clarity.\"*\n\nHere ends the explanation of the *Chart of Ascent and Descent of the True and Primordial Yin-Yang of the Great Cavern Above.*",
