  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Jade Seal of the Golden True Record of the Golden Portal of the Great One**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Jade Seal of the Golden True Record of the Golden Portal of the Great One*. Author unknown. Three sections in one scroll. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Divine Talismans Category*.\n\n---\n\n### **The Supreme Clarity Jade Seal of the Golden True Record of the Golden Portal of the Great One**\n\n#### **Talismans for Transcending Mortality and Ascending as an Immortal**\n1. **Talisman for Transcending Life, Returning to Birth, Harmonizing with the Divine, and Attaining the Way**\n2. **Talisman for Repelling Death, Rebirth, Uniting with the Divine in Virtue, and Transcending the World**\n\nOrdinary people who cultivate the Dao often begin their studies late and with shallow understanding, unaware of the Dao’s origins and still bound to the mortal realm. The mortal realm is rife with transgressions, and violations are manifold. Though one may utter repentant words and swear to reform, such vows reach the hearing of the Most High. One must take great care never again to commit the sins of evil, rebellion, or defiance of life.\n\nIf one accumulates ten grave transgressions, Heaven and Earth will not forgive, and death will serve as proof—no amendment or remedy will then be possible. The numinous subtleties of the Great Dao are most profound, yet even the prohibition against killing the six domestic animals and living beings cannot be observed if one fails to transform the heart and alter conduct. Such failure yields no benefit, much like the clash of water and fire. Those who gain its benefits ascend to Heaven in broad daylight; those who violate its precepts descend into the Three Springs in death.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Central Treasury of Numinous Treasure* states: \"The Eight Nodal Days are of utmost gravity, for they are the gates of life and death, as Zhao Boxuan called them.\" Thus, the *Scripture of the Nine Essences and Jade Transmission* says: \"On the Day of Autumn Judgment, the noble and the base alike face the reckoning of life and death.\" The ancients regarded the Autumn Equinox as the Day of Autumn Judgment. The reason is this: on the Autumn Equinox, the Perfected of the Nine Heavens and Eight Earths, the Divine August Ones, and the Most Honored gather for three days and three nights to determine the fate of all people. The assembly is vast, and the divine presences are revered and numerous.\n\nOn each of the Eight Nodal Days, the Perfected Officials of Heaven and Earth convene in sequence. For three days and three nights, they return to their respective offices. Daoist practitioners of modest learning should, on these days, ingest the **Talisman for Immortal Birth**, the **Talisman for Ascending to Heaven**, and the **Talisman for Eradicating Transgressions**. The talismanic texts are transmitted orally and not to be written down; they must be kept secret and guarded with utmost care.\n\n**Method for Ingestion on the Eight Nodal Days:**\nFace due north and swallow the talisman placed at the center.\n\n**The Talisman of the Great One for Eradicating Transgressions** is to be ingested on the Eight Nodal Days alongside the Immortal Talisman. First ingest the Immortal Talisman, then this one.\n\n**Activation Ritual:**\nStrike the bell thrice and recite the incantation:\n*\"Heaven blazes bright, Earth verdant lies;\nThe Talisman of the Great One, secret of long life.\nDivine youths attend, refining my form;\nFlesh strengthened, bones and flesh lightened.\nLifespan boundless, beholding Great Peace;\nI meet the True Lord, ascend to Heaven’s court.\nHasten, hasten, as decreed by law!\"*\n\nThe *Scripture of the Mysterious Cavern of Primordial Numinosity* states: The August Emperor Lord of the Supreme Prime, the Jade August One, ascends to the Celestial Abode of the Great Void, the Crimson City and Purple Terrace, the Eternal Jade Towers, where the Lords gather in the Observatory of the Grand Tenuity. Above, the gates of the Nine Heavens open to summon the True August Ones of the Nine Heavens; in the middle, the Three Elder Lords of the Supreme and the Perfected of the Northern Culmen are entreated; below, the immortals of the Five Marchmounts and famous mountains are commanded. Countless numinous august ones assemble in the Palace of the Vast Yang to collectively deliberate the merits and transgressions of all people under Heaven. They record fortunes and misfortunes, the diligence or negligence of Dao cultivators, the days and months of transgressions, the goodness or evil of their practices, the statutes of punishment, and the conditions of life and death—each according to their respective domains and origins. The details are reported to the Directors of Destiny and inscribed in the Yellow Register. Even the slightest merit or transgression is etched into the Crimson Sincerity Ledger; no hidden crime or secret virtue, however minute, escapes their singular discernment.\n\nAt midnight, emerge into the central courtyard, face north, remove your headscarf, bow twice, kneel, and petition the Most High August One of the Northern Culmen, seeking absolution for all transgressions. Ingest the **Talisman for Eradicating Transgressions** as you wish, then make your confession. Upon completing the ingestion, make this vow:\n*\"May the Supreme August Emperor erase my name from the Register of Death and transfer it to the Three Offices, inscribing me in the Record of Divine Immortals. I petition the Jade Tablet for long life and enduring vision, to commune with the True and penetrate the Numinous.\"*\n\nThen knock your head to the ground four times, bow twice more, and return to your oratory. Engage in deep self-reproach and visualize the deities of the Three Primes. Petition the Most High thrice in this manner, and your name will be entered into the Register of Upper Immortals, and all transgressions will be eradicated.\n\nThe **Three Primes** are the Mud-Pill Palace, the Crimson Palace, and the Cinnabar Field—these are the three deities. Visualize the deities of the Three Primes, petition the Heavenly Worthy, and seek their grace and absolution. Aid your own confession so that it must reach the heavens.\n\nOn the Autumn Equinox, make three such petitions, and your name in the Register of Life will be confirmed, while your name in the Register of Death will be erased.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Azure Center for Penetrating Destiny* further states: Those who diligently cultivate the Dao must constantly focus their thoughts day and night, visualizing Heaven and Earth and cherishing all living beings. In conduct, one must not dare to harm the divine; in speech, one must not dare to harm any being. Heaven and Earth are the fullness of my body, and the master and oratory are also within me. Thus, the sage encompasses the internal to know the external. If one wishes to reform, it is not necessary to enter the oratory in the central courtyard. Observe the origins of your actions and examine your conduct—this is the meaning.\n\nThe **Northern Culmen** is also my bodily form. One should simply remain in the seclusion of one’s dwelling, meditate in stillness, burn incense according to the method, and focus one’s thoughts—this is auspicious. If the turbid qi of myriad desires in the heart is not expelled, merely dwelling in the oratory will be of no benefit.\n\nIn ancient times, there was a certain Lord Pei who dwelled on a desolate mountain, cultivating the Dao with utmost dedication. In the first year, his form began to resemble that of an immortal; in the second year, the Five Emperors rode the sun, and their forms appeared at his left and right; by the third year, he laughed and rejoiced all day long.\n\nBy the fifth year, the Five Emperors became the Solar Lords, and together with Lord Pei, they rode as companions in a flying dragon-chariot, journeying east to the Celestial East of the Sun’s Cavern, to the Palace of Mengchang and Fusang, the City of the Eight Poles. They ascended the Terrace of Luminous Perfection, sat in the Hall of Rare Forest, and were bestowed the Divine Writ of Command and the Talismans of the Nine Domains. They feasted on the azure essence of solar nectar and drank the dark jade of cloudy sap, thereafter roaming daily with the Five Emperors, the Solar Lords—this is what is called the Way of Chasing the Sun. Thus, to absorb the essence of the sun, one must follow the Five Emperors who precede the sun; this method must not be neglected.\n\nThe *Central Scroll of the Hidden Book of Essential Dao* states: If you wish to become a Perfected One, you must visualize the Solar Lord, driving dragons and riding phoenixes, ascending the radiant clouds of heaven, journeying east to the Rare Forest, and entering the Gate of the Emperor. Through concentrated meditation, you will attain the essential Dao, no longer troubled by seeking fame to ascend the Azure Register, for the numinous will rank you among the Perfected Officials.\n\nThe method for becoming a Perfected One is this: each night, observe the moon. Face it, close your eyes, hold your breath for nine cycles, then swallow the moonlight nine times. Visualize the moonlight entering your mouth and swallow it. Next, visualize the Lady of the Azure Emperor arriving from within the moonlight, standing to your left, and the Lady of the Vermilion Emperor beside her.\n\nTo your right, visualize the Lady of the White Emperor; behind you, the Lady of the Black Emperor; above your left hand, the Lady of the Yellow Emperor; and above your right hand, the Ladies of the Five Emperors. Then visualize the flowing-bell cloud chariot, drawn by ten dragons, emerging from the moonlight and arriving before you. Envision the Five Ladies boarding together to ascend to the moon.\n\nIf you wish to ascend to heaven, visualize the Moon Lord, riding a flying dragon and mounting your flowing-bell chariot, journeying west to the Six Ridges and entering the Emperor’s Hall. Through concentrated meditation, you will appear at the court of the Heavenly Sovereign. By day, focus your meditation on the sun and visualize the Five Lords within it; by night, focus on the moon and visualize the Five Ladies within it. If your sincerity is profound, the sun and moon will unite as one.\n\nFor beginners, the Five Numinous Forms will manifest, bestowing scriptures and granting divine mushrooms. You will command the myriad spirits, summon jade maidens and jade lads, and attain the rank of the Four Perfected Ones. Thus, you will receive the *Plain Secret Golden Charter of the Grand One*. Face north and bow four times to the Four Perfected Ones, aligning with the positions of east, west, south, and north.\n\nThe scripture-receiving Perfected One is granted the *Tiger Talisman of the Divine*, to subdue the malevolent spirits of the Six Heavens’ flowing influx. The *Flowing Gold Bell* is used to summon the host of Perfected Ones. The *Green-Furred Staff* is carried to traverse the Nine Palaces. All these arise from subtle and wondrous concentrated meditation, silently moving the heart of heaven. Thus, the numinous descends to aid your body, and you ascend to the imperial court.\n\nFor Daoist practitioners in seclusion, if the sun or moon is obscured by clouds, simply visualize them in your heart—do not wait to see them. With such focused meditation, your mind will penetrate all things. First, visualize the Five Stars above your body, and the sun and moon will be present.\n\nThe *Dragon Secret Tiger Talisman* is to be worn by Daoists entering mountains or traveling to distant lands. Only those who follow the Way of the Grand One may wear it; it must not be worn recklessly.\n\nThe *Ninefold Numinous One* talisman is to be ingested on the seventh day of the seventh month. If worn, one must abstain from the flesh of the six domestic animals; if consuming such flesh, it must not be ingested. This was transmitted by the Nine Numinous Lords to the Nine Perfected Daoist Pei Chuhe in the depths of a stone mountain at the third watch.\n\nTo attain longevity and dispel the hundred diseases, swallow one *Longevity Talisman* each day.\n\nThe *Manifest Attainment Talisman* is to be ingested once daily for self-cultivation.\n\nTo attain longevity, swallow one talisman each day. Over time, you will naturally ascend to the mysterious Dao and perceive forms to foretell future events.\n\nHere ends the *Golden Chronicle of the Jade Seal of the Golden Palace of the Grand One of Supreme Clarity*.",

Thus, the numinous descends to aid your body, and you ascend to the imperial court.\n\nFor Daoist practitioners in seclusion, if the sun or moon is obscured by clouds, simply visualize them in your heart—do not wait to see them. With such focused meditation, your mind will penetrate all things. First, visualize the Five Stars above your body, and the sun and moon will be present.\n\nThe *Dragon Secret Tiger Talisman* is to be worn by Daoists entering mountains or traveling to distant lands. Only those who follow the Way of the Grand One may wear it; it must not be worn recklessly.\n\nThe *Ninefold Numinous One* talisman is to be ingested on the seventh day of the seventh month. If worn, one must abstain from the flesh of the six domestic animals; if consuming such flesh, it must not be ingested. This was transmitted by the Nine Numinous Lords to the Nine Perfected Daoist Pei Chuhe in the depths of a stone mountain at the third watch.\n\nTo attain longevity and dispel the hundred diseases, swallow one *Longevity Talisman* each day.\n\nThe *Manifest Attainment Talisman* is to be ingested once daily for self-cultivation.\n\nTo attain longevity, swallow one talisman each day. Over time, you will naturally ascend to the mysterious Dao and perceive forms to foretell future events.\n\nHere ends the *Golden Chronicle of the Jade Seal of the Golden Palace of the Grand One of Supreme Clarity*.",
