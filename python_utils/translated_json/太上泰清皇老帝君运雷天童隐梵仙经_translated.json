  "full_translation": "*The Supreme Great Clarity August Elder Thearch’s Scripture of Commanding Thunder, the Heavenly Youth, and the Hidden Brahma Immortal*\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Great Clarity August Elder Thearch’s Scripture of Commanding Thunder, the Heavenly Youth, and the Hidden Brahma Immortal*. Author unknown, approximately dating to the Song-Yuan period. It expounds the talismanic incantations and esoteric methods for summoning and dispatching thunder deities, marshals, and masters. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, *Wondrous Scripture Division*, *Original Texts Category*.\n\n---\n\n**Om!** O mighty spirits of wind, fire, and thunder—**Hāṭa!**—**Om!** **Duruṇi-ye! Om!** **Heisha-na-ye!**\nAugust Heaven gave me birth; August Earth bears me up. Sun and moon illuminate me; stars and constellations honor me. The host of immortals uplifts me; the Director of Destinies befriends me. The Great One entrusts me; the Jade Emperor summons me. The Three Officials protect me; the Five Thearchs guard me. May [missing characters] follow me. The Heavenly Officials transmit to me; the divine youth who receives the dharma, the Earthly Officials issue decrees. The Thunder Department attends me; the Water Officials command. The fire-qi converges to welcome me; all dragons heed me. My ascent reaches the Jade Clarity. The Five Marshals of the Primordial Heaven roar with thunderous voices. The Jade Emperor issues decrees. The Southern Palace aids me; the Northern Dipper assists me. The Golden Youths serve me; the Jade Maidens accompany me. The Six Jia spirits guide me; the Six Ding advance me. The gates of Heaven open for me; the portals of Earth yield to me. Mountains and marshes shelter me; rivers and streams ferry me across. Thunder and lightning follow me; the Eight Trigrams obey me. The Nine Palaces conceal me; the masters of yin and yang honor me. The Five Phases support me; the Four Seasons perfect me.\n\n**Om! Hūm! Guṭa!** Dishevel your hair, scatter your locks, and each transform into your true forms!\nThe Heavenly Marshal Tianpeng’s precious seal shines upon me. The Heavenly Marshal Tianyou wields his halberd to guard me. The Feathered Sage Perfected Lord grips his sword to protect me. The Dark Warrior of the True North aids me with water and fire. The Four Waterways defend me; the Nine Dragons encircle me. Sweet rains follow me; thunder and fire attend me. Lightning flashes to illuminate me; the Twenty-Four Qi Wheel-Marshals stand by me.\nMy body’s divine radiance, the void-Brahma sun and moon, swears an oath with Heaven [missing characters].\n\n**Om!** O luminous spirit of the Nine Heavens’ Li Palace! **Om!** **Bì-guāng!** **Chì-shā!** **Shè!**\n**Om!** **Moṭa!** Descend upon [missing characters] star! **Om!** **Jī-tàn!** **Zhā!** **Om!** **Shè-xù-zhā!** **Om!** **Yàn-qi!** Harmonize! Within, nourish the Three Hun; internally cultivate the Seven Po. Thunder Lords and Lightning Mothers strike in time with the drum.\n\n**Om!** **Fēi-máo-yǔ-zhā!** **Shè!** Copper fangs and iron claws! **Om!** **Chōng-nán-běi!** **Shè!** From south to north, from east to west, descend upon [missing characters]! Pursue through the flying void! In the Yellow Center, govern qi; in the black darkness, vast and boundless. The Celestial Dipper and Ox stir to life; gods flee in haste, ghosts lament in sorrow. Three commands seal all; five proclamations linger. The Metal Spirit soars in his chariot; the Wooden Youth, great spirit. Water surges through the Dark Portal; fire descends from the Lofty Clarity. Earth stabilizes the Five Palaces; sun and moon shine brightly. Dragons and tigers intertwine; wind and rain arise in response. Rivers and streams reverse their flow; mountains and peaks topple and collapse. Piercing Heaven and rending Earth, a journey of ten thousand leagues begins. What is sought is obtained; what is faced is accomplished. What is desired is united; what is plotted is fulfilled. The Great Sage of the Celestial Stem, the Venerable Spirit of the River Demon—through myriad transformations, they merge with the Dao in truth. What spirit will not obey? What command will not be executed?\nTo my left, the Azure Dragon; to my right, the White Tiger. Before me, the Vermilion Bird; behind me, the Dark Warrior. Above, the canopy of flowers crowns my head; below, I tread upon the Demon-Quelling Star. My divine power shines with majesty; my might shakes the ten directions. Those who love me thrive; those who hate me suffer calamity. Those who plot against me die; those who resent me perish. Divine youths and spirit maidens, Diamond Warriors who shatter evil—three thousand six hundred—ever at my side. Holding tablets and bearing talismans, they wander with me. The Supreme One seizes the light; Heaven is greatly auspicious. The Twenty-Four Marshals accompany the stellar calendar. Riding dragons and mounting tigers, they capture and behead demons and spirits. Should any disobey the command, a writ is sent to the thunderclaps. **Hasten! Hasten! Seize! Seize!**\n\n**Om!** **Chēn-yīn-tián-zhā-yīn-bāng-mìng-luō-yē-ā-sòng-tuó-nīng-chēn-líng-yē!** The Black Slayer of the Northern Emperor, stern and awe-inspiring spirit! **Hōng-tiān-pī-lì-shè!**\nThe Primordial Qian rescues and refines. The mighty wind-riding officers, the Wind-Pursuing Messengers, the Wind Earls manifest the Dao. They chase dragons and drive mists; wind and clouds swiftly arise. The Thunder-Commanding Messengers; lightning flashes into being. Wind rises from the Xun Portal; the Celestial Stem spreads like the Winnowing Basket Star. The Three Terraces assist me; flying thunder shakes and startles. The Wind Earls and Rain Masters swiftly descend in black clouds. The Thunder Lords wield lightning; wherever I go, no peril remains. Entering the sea, the gates of Heaven open; entering rivers, the portals of Earth emerge.\n\nThe Nine Heavens issue decrees to the Marshals of the Primordial Heaven. **Om!** **Xū!** Fire obeys the command! The Five Thearchs’ Thunder Lords, the Yin-Yang Thunder Lords, the Four Command Thunder Lords, the Six Jia Thunder Lords, the Thunderclap Thunder Lords, the Flood-Releasing Thunder Lords, the Eight Winds Thunder Lords, the Ten Rains Thunder Lords, the Six Paths Thunder Lords, the Lightning-Wielding Thunder Lords, the Wind-Raising Thunder Lords, the Rain-Bringing Thunder Lords, the Five Peaks Thunder Lords, the Four Waterways Thunder Lords, the Eight Nodes Thunder Lords, the Six Seasons Thunder Lords, the Great Rivers Thunder Lords, the Mountain Valleys Thunder Lords, the Rivers and Streams Thunder Lords, the Four Seas Thunder Lords, the Drum-Beating Thunder Lords, the Thunder-Wheel Thunder Lords, the Fire-Chariot Thunder Lords, the Fire-Wheel Thunder Lords, the Mountain-Shifting Thunder Lords, the Stone-Rolling Thunder Lords, the Cloud-Raising Thunder Lords, the Rain-Scattering Thunder Lords, the Snow-Marching Thunder Lords, the Frost-Spreading Thunder Lords, the Plague-Striking Thunder Lords, the Demon-Driving Thunder Lords, the Radiant Thunder Lords, the Dark Thunder Lords, the Fire-Seal Thunder Lords, the Formation-Breaking Thunder Lords—**Jīnyù Fēnglóng!** All that is sought arrives; worldly treasures gather at my behest. The ghosts and spirits of the world are driven by me. Should any fail to obey, the thunder-axe swiftly executes them. O luminous spirit of the Li Palace!\n\nOn the day of merit, my name is inscribed in the Upper Clarity. The spirits within my body naturally become pure and tranquil. The Supreme Mystery recommends me; my name is recorded in the Jade Roster. Before me, ranks of warriors stand; behind me, Heavenly Soldiers press forward. Driving thunder and crackling lightning, flying and coursing with fire and bells. The City Gods and Earth Spirits dare not delay.\n\n**Oṃ!** Ruluo—**zhā!** Dispatch the Heavenly Soldiers to their duties! The Messengers of the Five Directions, the Thunderclap Divinities—by imperial decree, let it be executed swiftly, swiftly, as the Law of the Supreme Venerable Sovereign Emperor of the Grand Primordial commands!\n\nThus concludes *The Hidden Brahma Sutra of the Celestial Youth Who Wields Thunder*, revealed by the Supreme Venerable Sovereign Emperor of the Grand Clarity.",
