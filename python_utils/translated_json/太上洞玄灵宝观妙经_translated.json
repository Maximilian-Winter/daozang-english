One fascicle.\n\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Cavern Mystery Section, Category of Original Texts.\n\n---\n\n*The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Contemplating the Wondrous*\n\nIf one desires to contemplate the wondrous and attain perfection, one must first abandon perverse and deviant conduct.

The mind is more often moving than still;\n2. The mind is equally moving and still;\n3. The mind is more often still than moving;\n4. The mind is still when unoccupied, yet moves when engaged;\n5. The mind constantly merges with the Dao, untroubled even by contact.\n\n**Seven Signs of the Body:**\n1. The mind attains true stability, untainted by clamor or dust;\n2. Long-standing ailments vanish, body and mind become clear and refreshed;\n3. Deficiencies are replenished, life is restored, and years are renewed;\n4. Lifespan is extended beyond the worldly, and one is called an *immortal*;\n5. The form is refined into *qi*, and one is called a *perfected person*;\n6. *Qi* is refined into spirit, and one is called a *spiritual person*;\n7. Spirit is refined to merge with the Dao, and one is called a *supreme person*.\n\nOne’s power of discernment grows ever clearer with each sign.\n\nIf, after long study of stilling the mind, not a single sign appears,\nAnd only when the impure body perishes does emptiness arise—\nTo attain the true Dao in such a case has never been heard of.\n\n**Here ends *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture on Contemplating the Wondrous*.**",
