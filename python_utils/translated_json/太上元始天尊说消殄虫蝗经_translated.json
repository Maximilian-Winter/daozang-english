Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Most High was upon Jade Capital Mountain in the Great Brahma Heaven, broadly expounding the wondrous Dharma to the great assembly.\n\nThen, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate knelt reverently, holding a tablet, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: \"I observe that the people of the world take farming and sericulture as their foundation, nurturing their bodies and forms, relying upon fields and silkworms. In recent times, locusts and pests have arisen in swarms, while floods and droughts disrupt the balance, damaging crops and seedlings. The myriad people of the world are filled with dread and sorrow, men and women grieving, with nowhere to turn in prayer. The people personally journey to sacred mountains to make offerings, yet receive no response; the locusts remain unvanquished, and timely rains are nowhere in sight. I know not what karmic offenses the common folk have accumulated to be met with such silence in their pleas. I only beseech the Heavenly Worthy to bestow special enlightenment.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"I see that when the people of the world enjoy abundance each year, they utterly lack reverence and faith. They do not honor the Three Luminaries, treating their grains with contempt—trampled by chickens and dogs, scattered amidst filth, wasted without use, and left unguarded. The celestial bodies observe that the people of the world harbor no reverence or faith, thus bringing forth locusts, pests, floods, and droughts, as you now witness. Yet, I am greatly pleased by the Perfected One’s petition.\n\nI now dispatch the Five Thearchs of the Great Demons, the officials of the Three Primes, the divine generals of the Six Jia, the Five Marchmounts and Four Seas, the Earls of Wind and Master of Rain, the Duke of Thunder and Mother of Lightning, the twenty-four Lords of Qi, the Eight Great Dragon Kings of the Grotto Palaces and Sacred Mountains, the spirits of the Five Grains, and all dragon deities to descend into the world below. They shall capture and eradicate the locusts, ensuring wind in harmony and rain in season, so that the myriad people of the world may turn from evil and embrace goodness.\n\nIt is fitting to establish ritual altars within palaces, temples, sacred platforms, immortal retreats, and grotto sanctuaries, arranging true images therein. For one or two days, or even up to seven, with unified hearts and pure devotion, burn fine incense, circumambulate, and recite this scripture. Offer vegetarian feasts and perform jiao rites, petitioning the celestial bodies, stellar deities, and honored spirits above. By generating great merit and blessings, the locusts shall be eliminated, rain shall come in season and winds in harmony, the Five Grains shall ripen in abundance, granaries shall overflow, the people shall rejoice, the land shall know peace, and clothing and sustenance shall arise of themselves.\"\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy spoke this gatha:\n\n> Mortals who fail to accumulate goodness\n> Are beset by calamities and misfortune.\n> If farming and planting lack diligence,\n> Locusts, floods, and droughts descend.\n> The abstruse and obscure are hard to fathom,\n> Elusive and untraceable.\n> Yet if mortals hold reverence,\n> Myriad disasters shall not encroach.\n> When beings practice kindness and filial piety,\n> Heavenly blessings naturally follow.\n> Thus, honor the Great Dao,\n> And year after year, abundance shall be secured.\n\nWhen the Heavenly Worthy had finished speaking this verse, the great assembly, including the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, all bowed their heads in reverence, overjoyed. They danced in celebration, made obeisance, and withdrew, faithfully receiving and upholding the teachings.\n\nHere ends *The Scripture on Eliminating Locust Plagues Spoken by the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy*.",
