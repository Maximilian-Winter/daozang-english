  "full_translation": "**The Praise of the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing***\n\n**Title:** *The Praise of the Yellow Emperor’s Yin Fu Jing* (originally titled *The Praise of the Yuan Yang Zi*, likely from the late Tang or Five Dynasties period).\nRecorded in *Comprehensive Records of Arts and Literature* (*Tongzhi Yiyu Lüe*).\nOne scroll.\n\n**Source:** *The Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era* (*Zhengtong Daizang*), in the *Dongzhen* (Vacuous Perfection) section, under *Praise and Eulogies* (赞颂类).\n\n---\n\n**The Praise of the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing***\n\n**Chapter of the Dao/Way Embracing Unity to Manifest the Divine**\n\nTo observe the Dao/Way of Heaven, to grasp Heaven’s actions—this is complete.\nWithin Heaven, the symbols hang, refining the primordial essence;\nThe supreme Dao/Way flows harmoniously in the boundless void.\n\nTo attain the One and observe Heaven’s Dao/Way reveals no other path;\nThe Yellow Emperor’s fundamental essence is made clear in its entirety.\n\nThus, Heaven has five thieves—those who see them flourish.\nThe enlightened mind perceives the radiance of the Nine-One;\nThe Five Stars gather in the *Li Xiang* (离乡, \"Exile’s Field\").\n\nIf mortals could cultivate and obtain them,\nThe Yellow Emperor’s praise of the five thieves would be in vain.\n\nThe five thieves dwell in the heart,\nManifesting in Heaven’s actions.\n\nWhen the five thieves are subdued, Heaven’s gates turn;\nIn sequence, they disperse, returning to the Nine.\n\nThe golden door of *Jin Hua* (金华, \"Golden Splendor\") opens within arm’s reach,\nThe King of Huai Nan harvests without hindrance.\n\nThe universe lies within the hand,\nTen thousand transformations arise from the body.\n\nA skilled hand can grasp the light of sun and moon,\nEmerging from the body, the myriad forms unfold like the Yellow River’s coiling hexagram.\n\nThe Dao’s universe is flawless and without blemish;\nWithout enlightenment, how could one know the *Kan* (坎, \"Abyss\") holds the Yang?\n\nHeaven’s nature is human;\nHuman mind is the mechanism.\n\nHeaven’s advantage and humanity’s harmony align with the cosmos,\nThe mind’s deepest sensitivity unlocks the Dao’s hidden paths.\n\nThe numinous essence is not without feeling—\nWhen the way is found, its power is proven.\n\nTo establish Heaven’s Dao/Way is to set humanity’s foundation.\nHeaven’s One (天一) reveals the Yang light, shining westward,\nWood’s Three (木三) green qi takes it as its mate.\n\nWater and Mercury are not the true essence of lead,\nYet how does the *Kan* (坎) recognize the *Gui* (圭, \"Jade Scepter\")?\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes its killing intent,\nDragons and serpents rise upon the land.\n\nWhen Heaven compensates the General’s *Bing* (丙) to restore his authority,\nDragons and serpents retreat from the land, ceasing their ravages.\n\nThe *Tai Qing* (太清, \"Supreme Clarity\") Sea transforms into the Penglai Isle,\nFixed in the *Geng Xin* (庚辛) position, standing alone in majesty.\n\nWhen humanity unleashes its killing intent,\nHeaven and Earth recoil in chaos.\n\nIf killing qi spreads through the *Yan Gong* (炎宫, \"Fiery Palace\"),\nEven rats scurrying in confusion leave no trace.\n\nIn *Ji Zi* (既济, \"Already Completed\"), dragons and tigers appear in transit,\nThe *Kan Li* (坎离, \"Abyss-Fire\") reversal is sealed—its depths cannot be fathomed.\n\nWhen Heaven and humanity both unleash their intent,\nThe myriad transformations rest upon a fixed foundation.\n\nHuman and Heaven’s paths merge like twin strings,\nAdvancing and retreating, their radiance shifts day and night.\n\nThe myriad transformations now flow within the divine chamber,\nThe foundation established in the single *Dan Tian* (丹田, \"Elixir Field\").\n\nNature has its clever and clumsy;\nBoth can be concealed.\n\nWhen virtue is accumulated and perfected, the great *Bian Yin* (辨音, \"Discriminating Sound\") emerges,\nWisdom and folly in humanity’s methods sink into the depths.\n\nThe path to the clouds is not distant—\nThe clumsy may fail to grasp its essence with their minds.\n\nThe nine orifices’ malevolence lies in the three essentials;\nThe *Ding* (鼎, \"Cauldron\") guards against deceit in the Eight Gates.\n\nSeal the three essentials to restrain the Yang spirit,\nAnd the *Fu Yao* (复爻, \"Returning Trigrams\") will turn, dispelling ill omens until reaching *Kun* (坤, \"Earth\").\n\nIt can be applied in motion and stillness.\nFire is born from Wood—disaster arises, yet must be overcome.\nDeceit is born within the realm—when the time moves, it collapses.\n\nWood generates true Fire, turning disaster into blessing,\nThe body shifts to the Just Metal position, gaining even greater honor.\n\nIf the *Fa Xiang* (法象, \"Methodic Forms\") are incomplete, benevolence and righteousness will falter,\nWhere then is the path to find the deceitful gates?\n\nTo know and refine—this is called the Sage.\nThe Daoist’s bones can traverse the upper and lower truths,\nKnowledge shines forth in an extraordinary form.\n\nRefining lead to achieve the flowing pearl’s dwelling,\nThe Yellow Emperor’s power will aid in its completion.\n\nTo enrich the land and secure the people—manifesting the method (Chapter Middle)\nHeaven’s creation and Heaven’s destruction are the Dao’s principle.\nThe red marrow (赤髓) arises to subdue the white Heaven,\nMeeting the Yang, it returns to lead as the killing intent is fulfilled.\n\nMercury is a single elixir for the Daoist’s fortune,\nAbiding in Fire—this is no mere coincidence.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the thieves of all things;\nHeaven’s *Li Xiang* (离乡, \"Exile’s Field\") opens the path of *Gui* (圭, \"Jade Scepter\"),\nEncompassing all forms within the fluid embrace of *Kan* (坎) and *Kun* (坤).\n\nAlas, how petty the thieves of creation are—\nThe five thieves cross paths day and night, fleeing in disarray.\n\nAll things are humanity’s thieves.\nHumanity seeks Earth’s advantage, all in harmony,\nYet who knows the rise and fall of creation’s true purpose?\n\nThe *Yuan Yang* (元阳, \"Primordial Yang\") is hidden—why does it not steal?\nThe *Yuan Yin* (元阴, \"Primordial Yin\") drifts by in vain for a hundred years.\n\nHumanity is the thief of all things.\nHunger for food, cold for clothing—nurturing the body’s hues,\nYet unaware that the floating illusions steal the spirit’s essence.\n\nHow better to delve into the *Yin Fu*’s principles,\nTo avoid being ensnared by the cycles of flourishing and decay!\n\nThe three thieves are pacified, the Three Powers (三才) are secure.\nThus it is said:\nTo eat in season, all limbs are in order.\nTo move the mechanism, all transformations are at ease.\n\nThe three thieves align with the One, entering the *Dui Gong* (兑宫, \"Joy Palace\"),\nThe four seasons encounter the *Jin Gong* (金公, \"Metal Authority\") with reliance.\n\nThe Daoist’s peach ripens beautifully, extending sinew and bone,\nA hundred monsters’ mechanisms swiftly reveal their fates.\n\nHumanity knows its spirit when it is manifest,\nYet does not know the spirit’s absence—nor how it manifests.\n\nThe Dao’s principles stand as eternal foundations,\nThe spirit requires the method’s radiance to shine.\n\nThe white gold’s traces are hidden—who can measure them?\nThe *Tai Yi* (太一, \"Supreme Unity\") knows their coming, aiding the Sage and Emperor.\n\nSun and moon have their appointed numbers,\nGreat and small have their fixed positions.\nFrom this, the Sage’s achievements arise,\nAnd the divine brilliance is revealed.\n\nThe soul and spirit’s essence flourishes in the Nine-One,\nReturning and transforming, pairing in perfect correspondence.\n\nThe Sage’s achievements gradually awaken, filling the air with fragrant qi,\nThe divine chamber’s arrival is certain—it must ascend.\n\nTheir thieving mechanisms are such that\nNo one beneath Heaven can see or know them.\nYet the myriad transformations’ functions cover the One,\nAnd all people witness them, though none can articulate them.\n\nWhen Yin accumulates, its solution lies in Yin’s enlightenment,\nIn the flash of stone and fire, one encounters the lotus.\n\nThe noble attains it and remains steadfast,\nThe petty gain it and lose their lives.\n\nThe Daoist wards off deceit, refining the cauldron’s heart,\nThe *Dao* (刀, \"Knife\") and *Gui* (圭, \"Jade Scepter\") grow old, filling the Yin in rotation.\n\nThe foolish cling to petty gains from the Heavenly officials’ methods,\nLightly valuing life, they only revere the *Dian Hua Jin* (点化金, \"Refined Gold\").\n\nThe myriad sights divide into ten thousand vistas—\nWith palms, the sage turns the **Heavenly Sphere** and **Earthly Balance**;\nBefore all things, the heart reveres the **Unobstructed Gate**,\nAnd in the face of phenomena, it stands firm in **Non-duality**.\n\nLeakage lies in **heedlessness**, yet mercy resides within oneself—\nWhen things become the mark of life and death, the **Yang Soul** abides.\nAt **Supreme Joy**, nature overflows,\nAt **Supreme Stillness**, it is **pure and refined**.\n\nHaving fulfilled the work, one departs with ease from clamor and tumult,\nAnd wanders freely at will in the **Lofty Dao’s Source**.\nGuarding **naïveté**, preserving **modesty**,\nRefining the **self** to **stillness**—\nA single furnace’s **elixir meal** grants a lifespan of millennia.\n\n**Heaven’s utmost secrecy**,\nYet its application is **utterly public**.\nThe **mechanism** of beasts lies in their **qi**;\n**Heaven’s mechanism** makes them soar into **Divine Mysteries**,\nAnd its **elevating power** remains ever fresh.\n\nFrom **Mao** (卯), **gold and jade** are born, hidden yet flowing with **emerald clarity**,\nWhile **Xu** (戌) and **Hai** (亥) become **auspicious fire**, the **key to passage**.\n\nThe living are the **root of death**,\nThe dead are the **root of life**.\nTo have the **root of life and death** is to grasp the **Divine**—\nSlaying **mercury** refines the **elixir**, reviving the people.\n\nIf one abandons the **Five Phases**, they should not **steal**,\nYet without mastering the **Primordial Principle**, their words remain incomplete.\n\nMercy arises from **harm**,\nHarm arises from **mercy**.\nThe **Moon’s Soul** brings mercy, its **embryo** lies in **Li** (离);\nAgain, relying on **Geng** (庚) to seize the **Refined Gold’s posture**.\n\nWhen following **harm** to generate **mercy’s blessings**,\nThe **Five Omens** and **Tortoise** alone hold the secret.\n\nThe **foolish** revere **Heaven and Earth’s patterns** as **sacred**,\nYet the path from **mundane to sacred** is steep and winding,\nThe **Dao** aligning with **Heaven and Earth**, its **law** having **no and yes**.\nThe **garlic and mustard seeds** cast upon the peak return to their own dwelling,\nKnowing the **Primordial Assembly** is unlike the **foolish**.\n\nI grasp **time and things’ patterns** as **sagely profound**—\nThe **four seasons’ thin qi** shifts between **Yin and Yang**,\nThe **Divine Water** once pure now turns to **fermented elixir**.\nEven on level ground, there is **lead**; **lead** is not **tin**,\nYet only by exhausting **Heaven’s Principle** can one measure its **wondrous subtleties**.\n\nThe **Dao of Nature** is **still**,\nThus **Heaven and Earth** give birth to the **myriad things**.\nThe **Two Primordials** harmonize, their **qi** balanced—\nPhenomena are **carved and polished**, like jade under the knife.\nAll **movement and stillness** stem from the **Black Tortoise and White Hare’s** power,\nThe **Primordial Changes** I sing in the **Stone Man’s** hymn.\n\nThe **Dao of Heaven and Earth** is **deeply permeating**,\nThus **Yin and Yang** prevail.\nThe **Earthly Ascension** and **Heavenly Descent** are the **essence of the Primordial Pearl**,\nEntering **mystery**, it becomes the **leaping fish of the elixir**.\n**Yang’s movement** and **Yin’s dissipation** are **Divine**—\nThe **Day Soul** and **Moon Spirit** merge, their **origin** beyond knowing.\nWhen **Yin and Yang** propel each other, **transformation** flows naturally—\nMutually **generating** and **conquering**, they **embrace and conceal**.\n**Transformation** makes **lead** ascend, **stone** refine into **steel**.\n**Decline reaching its extreme**, **prosperity follows**—\nWho before their eyes is not **Yin and Yang**?\n\nThus the **sage** knows the **Dao of Nature** cannot be defied,\nAnd so **follows it** to regulate their **mechanisms**.\nThe **Immortal’s** **regulation of qi** points to the **Primordial Machine**,\n**Gold and Stone**’s **Yin and Yang** cannot be defied.\n**Blessings and uses** stem from one **Gate**, as the **Ancients’** *I Ching* teaches—\nThe **Dao of the Triple Burner** aligns with **Heaven’s Mysteries**.\n\nThe **Dao of Supreme Stillness** cannot be measured by **calendars and rites**,\nYet even **birds and beasts** occupy their **positions**.\nHere are **wondrous instruments**,\nThat generate the **myriad phenomena**.\nThe **Pure Yang** and **Supreme Stillness**—the **Dao of Penetrating Emptiness**—\nWould never let **calendars and rites** constrain its **beginning and end**.\n\nThe **garlic key** and **mustard lock** hold no **concealment** for **birds and beasts**,\nYet within it lies the **Diagram of the Mixed Primordial**.\nThe **Eight Trigrams** and **Ten Heavenly Stems**—\nThe **Divine Machine** hides **ghostly secrets**.\n**Li** (离) heads, **Kan** (坎) water, **Xun** (巽) **refines** the **metallic essence**,\n**Dui** (兑) enters the **Dragon Palace**, **Zhen** (震) **purifies** the **jade clarity**.\n\n**Jia** (甲) assembles with **Bing** (丙) and **Ren** (壬) in **Heaven’s ghostly concealment**,\n**Geng** (庚), **Xin** (辛), **Bo** (艮) **must** **Kun** (坤) to **complete**.\nThe **art of conquering Yin and Yang** is **radiantly clear**—\nThe **beautiful maiden** seeks the **matchmaker** to preserve her **complexion**,\nThe **Yellow Sage** heeds the **Divine** and **rectifies** his **conduct** at the **court’s threshold**.\n\nHand in hand, they enter the **Golden Flower’s Peak**,\nAnd spend the day at leisure within **Heaven and Earth’s** embrace.\nThey advance beyond **symbols**—\nLooking back on **worldly desires**, they ponder the **path**,\nYet the **journey’s progress** has its **route**, leading to the **Immortal’s fork**.\n\nOnly seek the **Yin Symbol’s Principle** above,\nFor **Heaven’s Way** is **manifest**—one who **sees** knows it.\nThe **Yellow Emperor’s** *Yin Symbol Classic* is **completed**.",
