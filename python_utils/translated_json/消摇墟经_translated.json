  "full_translation": "**The Scripture of Xiaoyao Wilderness**\n\n**Title:** *The Scripture of Xiaoyao Wilderness*\n**Author:** Hong Zicheng of the Ming Dynasty\n**Format:** Two fascicles\n**Source Text:** *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*\n\n**Fascicle One of The Scripture of Xiaoyao Wilderness**\n\nWhen mortals are ensnared in the world’s net, the scramble of flies and the pursuit of ants are beneath mention. Even those of old praised for lofty aspirations and noble conduct often find their wings forged and feet shackled, like steeds in harness or crows in cages.\n\nYet who can shed their husk like the cicada and soar like the phoenix, drifting free beyond the dust of things? Only the feathered transcendents and immortal assemblies come to mind—they who sip cloud blossoms, feast on stone marrow, ride purple phoenixes in flight across a thousand leagues, and roam at will astride azure oxen. A single flowering staff carries them across the three thousand worlds of mist and waves; half a tattered robe leads them to the twelve grotto-heavens. This is surely what Master Zhuang meant by *xiaoyao*—carefree wandering.\n\nBy nature, I am ill-suited to worldly company, having long since withdrawn from all earthly vapors. Only purple mushrooms and white stones hold an old fascination for me.\n\nI, Hong Zicheng, am a disciple of Xindu. One day, I was presented with a scroll of immortal records and asked to compose a preface. Upon perusing it, I found azure mists and violet vapors swirling about me, as though I had journeyed to the sea to bow before the Perfected of the Dry Land. The effect was intoxicating—one felt as if already ascending to the cinnabar mounds of the desire realm, the dusty world transformed into a fairy isle of Penglai. Yet even for those with immortal roots or a predestined bond with the Dao, to grasp the skin while forgetting the marrow is no true path to transcendence.\n\nAmid the dust and toil of kalpas past, one may pause to catch one’s breath, wipe the eyes, burn incense of nameless fragrance, and sip bitter tea—such moments of quiet contemplation are like swallowing fire only to quench it with ice. If one day I escape this cage and wander the azure void, I shall take this text as my jade pestle, and perhaps it will not be said that I act without cause.\n\n**Contents of The Scripture of Xiaoyao Wilderness**\n**Lineages of the Immortals**\n\n**Lineages of the Immortals**\n\nLaozi\nEastern King Father (Dong Wanggong)　　Queen Mother of the West (Xi Wangmu)\nRed Pine Master (Chisongzi)　　　Master Guangcheng\nGreen Crow Master (Qingwugong)　　　Peng Zu\nIron Crutch Master (Tieguai Xiansheng)　　　Prince Wang Qiao\nYin Xi　　　Li Babai\nDing Lingwei　　　Master Guigu\nLiu Yue　　　Most High Old Father (Taishang Laofu)\nWhite Stone Master (Baishi Sheng)　　　An Qisheng\nDongfang Shuo　　　Zhongli Quan\nMa Chengzi　　　Liu Haichan\nHuang An　　　Liu Chen\nMaster Fuqiu　　　Wei Boyang\nZhang Daoling　　　Mei Fu\nXiao Shi　　　Fei Changfang\nHuang Chuping　　　Lan Caihe\nMaster Mayi　　　Ma Gu\nLü Chunyang　　　Sun Deng\nZuǒ Ci　　　Han Xiangzi\nDuke Cao　　　Lord Xu (Xu Zhenjun)\nMaster Ge (Ge Xianweng)　　　He Xiangu\nZhang Guolao　　　Wang Zhi\nHuang Yeren　　　Tao Hongjing\nMaster Sima　　　Pei Hang\nSun Simiao　　　Tan Qiao\nXu Xuanping　　　Master Xuan Zhen\nXuan Yuanji　　　Chen Tuan\nMaster Lei Yin　　　Ma Ziran\nZhang Ziyang　　　Li Biti\nMaster Gui Yuan　　　Bai Yuchan\nChen Nian　　　Mo Yueding\nMa Danyang　　　Zhang Sanfeng\nLord Lao (Laojun)\n\nLaozi is the Most High Lord Lao (Taishang Laojun), who has manifested through successive kalpas without ever having a beginning in birth. By the time of King Yang Jia of the Shang, he divided his spirit and transformed his qi, first dwelling in the womb of the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden for eighty-one years. In the gengchen year of King Wu Ding’s reign, on the fifteenth day of the second month at the hour of mao, he descended and was born in Ku County of Chu, in Qu Ren Village of Lai Township, emerging from his mother’s left armpit beneath a plum tree. Pointing to the tree, he said, “This shall be my surname.” At birth, his hair was white and his face yellow, with long ears and square eyes. His nose had twin pillars of pure bone, and his ears had three openings. His fine beard spread across his broad cheeks, his teeth were sparse and his mouth square. His feet bore the marks of the Three and Five, and his hands grasped the Ten Patterns. His surname was Li, his given name Er, his courtesy name Boyang, and he was styled Laozi. He was also called Lao Dan.\n\nWhen King Wen of Zhou was the Western Earl, he summoned Laozi to serve as Archivist. During the reign of King Wu, he was promoted to Grand Historian. He then traveled to the Western Limits, Da Qin, and Jambudvipa, where he was known as the Ancient Master, transforming and guiding those lands. During the reign of King Kang, he returned to Zhou and again served as Grand Historian. In the twenty-third year of King Zhao’s reign, he rode a blue ox-drawn carriage through Hangu Pass. The Pass Prefect Yin Xi, recognizing him, sought and obtained the Dao. In the twenty-fifth year, he descended at the Green Sheep Market in Shu and, together with Yin Xi, crossed the Flowing Sands into the Hu territories. By the time of King Mu, he had returned to the Central Lands. In the seventeenth year of King Jing’s reign, Confucius inquired of the Dao from Lao Dan and, upon retiring, sighed that he was like a dragon. In the ninth year of King Nan’s reign, he again emerged from the Sanyuan Pass and ascended to Kunlun in flight.\n\nDuring the Qin, he descended by the banks of the Jia River, where he was known as the Riverbank Elder, transmitting the Dao to An Qisheng. In the time of Emperor Wen of Han, he was called Master Guangcheng. The emperor dispatched envoys to summon him, but the Master said, “The Dao is revered and virtue is noble; they cannot be inquired of from afar.” The emperor then personally journeyed to him. The emperor said, “Within the realm, there are Four Greats, and the king occupies one. Though you possess the Dao, you are still my subject. Why not submit? What is so lofty? I can make the poor rich and the lowly noble.” The Master then rose from his village seat, floating gently into the empty air like a cloud ascending. He stopped in the mysterious void more than a hundred yards above the ground. After a long while, he replied with joy, “Above, you do not reach Heaven; in the middle, you are unlike men; below, you do not dwell on Earth. What subjects do you have? How can Your Majesty make them rich or poor, noble or base?” The emperor awakened and descended from his carriage to bow in apology. The Master then bestowed upon him the two scriptures of the *Dao* and *Virtue*.\n\nIn truth, there is no age in which he does not appear. He enacts transformation before the kalpas of dust and abides eternally beyond the ultimate end. His concealment and manifestation are unfathomable, his transformations boundless. Universally delivering gods and humans, his deeds cannot be fully recounted.\n\n**Eastern King Father (Dongwang Gong)**\nThe Eastern King Father, whose personal name was Ni and courtesy name Junming, was born through primordial transformation on the Azure Sea’s expanse, in the Wastes of Cangling, before the world had people or things. His Dao-nature was serene and still, his embodied form perfectly non-active. He assisted in the mysterious work, nurturing and transforming the myriad beings. Master of the yang and harmonious qi, he governed the East and was also called the Eastern King Father. All those in Heaven and Earth—men who ascend as immortals and attain the Dao—are under his charge.\n\nOn a dingmao day, he ascended a terrace to observe the immortals ascending to Heaven through kalpic transformation, which numbered nine ranks. Yet when first ascending, they first bow to the Grand Duke, then pay respects to the Metal Mother. Only after completing these rites may they ascend the Nine Heavens and enter the Three Purities, where they pay homage to the Most High and behold the Primordial Beginning.\n\nIn the early Han, a group of children chanted a playful rhyme by the road: *“Don a blue skirt, ascend Heaven’s gate, bow to the Metal Mother, salute the Wood Father.”* No one at the time understood its meaning, but Zhang Liang went to pay his respects. He later told others, “This is the Jade Lad of the Eastern King Father.”\n\n**Western Queen Mother (Xiwang Mu)**\nThe Western Queen Mother is also known as the Golden Mother of Tortoise Terrace. She received the supremely wondrous qi of the Western Florescence and was transformed into being in Yi River, with the surname Wei, personal name Hui, and courtesy name Wanling. She holds sway in the West, jointly governing the two qi with the Eastern King Father, harmonizing Heaven and Earth, and shaping the myriad beings. All those in Heaven and Earth—women who ascend as immortals—are under her jurisdiction.\n\nShe resides in the Gardens of Kunlun, the Enclosure of the Wind’s Fragrance. Her nine-tiered jade towers and mysterious terraces are flanked on the left by the Jasper Pool and encircled on the right by the Emerald Waters. Her Five-Flowered Grove of women includes beauties like the Orchid Maidens and Jade Goblet Fairies.\n\nWhen King Mu of Zhou made his western tour with his Eight Steeds, he presented a white jade tablet and a dark jade disk to pay his respects to the Queen Mother, who then feasted him upon the Jasper Pool. The Mother sang for the king: *“White clouds drift in the sky, mountain forests arise of themselves. The road is long and distant, the mountains and rivers inquire of it. If you, my lord, do not die, you may yet seek it again.”*\n\nIn the first year of the *Yuanfeng* era of the Later Han, she descended upon the palace of Emperor Wu, presenting him with seven peaches of immortality. The emperor wished to keep their pits, but the Queen Mother said, “These peaches do not grow in the mortal world—they bear fruit but once every three thousand years.” At that moment, Dongfang Shuo was seen peering through the window. The Mother pointed and said, “This boy has already stolen my peaches twice.”\n\nThat day, she commanded her attendant Dong Shuangcheng to play the *Cloud Harmony* flute, Wang Zideng to pluck the *Eight Jade* zither, Xu Feiqiong to sound the *Spirit Void* reed organ, and An Faxing to sing the *Mystic Spirit* hymn, offering blessings to Emperor Wu.\n\n**Chisongzi**\nChisongzi, the Rain Master of the Shennong era, refined his spirit and ingested *qi*, able to enter water without wetting and fire without burning. He journeyed to Kunlun Mountain and often dwelled in the Queen Mother’s stone chamber, ascending and descending with the winds and rains. The Flame Emperor’s youngest daughter pursued him and, attaining immortality, departed with him. In the time of Gao Xin, he served as Rain Master, wandering among mortals.\n\n**Guangchengzi**\nGuangchengzi, a man of the Xuanyuan era, secluded himself in a stone chamber on Kongtong Mountain. The Yellow Emperor visited him, inquiring about the essence of the supreme Dao. He replied: “The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; its ultimate truth, dark and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness—then the body will right itself. Be still, be pure; do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence, do not let your thoughts churn restlessly, and you may attain long life. Guard within, seal without; excess wisdom leads to ruin. I preserve the One and dwell in harmony—thus have I lived one thousand two hundred years without aging.”\n\n**Qingwu Gong**\nQingwu Gong, a disciple of Peng Zu, received instruction from an enlightened master and mastered the wondrous principles of true immortality. He entered the mountains of Huayin to cultivate the Dao, accumulating four hundred seventy-one years. Later, he ingested golden elixir and ascended to heaven.\n\n**Peng Zu**\nPeng Zu, Qian Keng by name, was a great-great-grandson of Emperor Zhuanxu. By the end of the Yin dynasty, he had lived over seven hundred years yet showed no signs of aging. Fond of tranquility, he excelled in the arts of nourishing life, consuming mica, quartz, and deer antler, ever retaining a youthful countenance. When King Mu heard of him, he appointed Peng Zu as a grandee, but Peng Zu claimed illness and took no part in governance. The Royal Concubine rode in a curtained carriage to seek his teachings. He imparted all essential methods, which she then taught the king. The king tested them and found them effective. Peng Zu, sensing this, departed, and his whereabouts became unknown. Seventy years later, his disciples saw him west of the Flowing Sands.\n\n**Iron-Crutch Master**\nThe Iron-Crutch Master, surnamed Li, was by nature robust. In his early years, he heard the Dao and cultivated truth in mountain caves. At times, Lord Lao and Master Wanqiu descended to his mountain retreat to instruct him in the teachings of the Dao. One day, the Master was to meet Lord Lao on Mount Hua. He instructed his disciple: “My *po* remains here; if my wandering soul does not return within seven days, you may then dissolve my *po*.” The disciple, rushing home due to his mother’s sudden illness, dissolved it on the sixth day. The Master returned on the seventh day but, finding his *po* gone, attached himself to the corpse of a starved beggar. Thus, his form became lame and unsightly, no longer his original self.\n\n**Wang Ziqiao**\nWang Ziqiao, Crown Prince Jin of King Ling of Zhou, loved to play the *sheng*, mimicking the cry of the phoenix. While wandering between the Yi and Luo rivers, the Daoist Master Fuqiu Gong carried him to the summit of Mount Songgao. Over thirty years later, Ziqiao appeared to Xiang Liang and said, “Tell my family to await me on the seventh day of the seventh month at the summit of Mount Hou.” On the appointed day, he indeed arrived riding a white crane, alighting upon the mountain’s peak—visible but unreachable. He bowed to the people below, lingering for several days before departing. Later, a shrine was erected for him at the foot of Mount Weishi.\n\n**Yin Xi**\nYin Xi, styled Gongwen, was a native of Tianshui.\n\nAt first, his mother once napped in the daytime and dreamed of the crimson clouds of heaven swirling around her body. When Xi was born, lotus flowers spontaneously bloomed upon the earth. As he grew, his eyes held the essence of the sun, his bearing tall and refined, his arms hanging past his knees—his majesty was that of a celestial being. From youth, he devoted himself to the study of the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, the *Book of Changes*, and the cultivation of virtue and benevolence, spurning worldly rites. He humbled himself to aid others, seeking neither fame nor advancement.\n\nDuring the reign of King Kang of Zhou, he served as a grandee. Gazing at the celestial patterns, he saw a purple qi advancing westward from the east and knew a sage would soon cross the pass. He thus requested to be appointed magistrate of Hangu Pass. He instructed the gatekeeper Sun Jing in advance: “Should any appear with an extraordinary bearing or unusual carriage, do not permit them to pass.”\n\nIn the twenty-third year of King Zhao’s reign, the seventh month, the Old Master indeed arrived, riding a white carriage drawn by a black ox, intending to cross the pass. The gatekeeper entered to report to Xi, who said, “Today I shall behold the sage!” He immediately donned his court robes, went forth to meet him, and prostrated himself in invitation, saying, “I beseech you to tarry awhile, divine carriage.”\n\nThe Old Master declined, “I am but a poor, lowly old man dwelling east of the pass, my fields lying west of it. I merely journey to gather firewood—why detain me?”\n\nXi again bowed deeply, “Long have I known the great sage would come traveling west. You have endured exposure for days—pray rest your divine carriage awhile.”\n\nThe Old Master replied, “I have heard that in the lands of Jambudvīpa, there is an ancient master. Thus I follow the Way, passing through your pass—why should I linger?”\n\nXi said, “Beholding your sacred countenance, transcendent and peerless, you are surely the supreme one of heaven. What need have you to visit the frontier barbarians?”\n\nThe Old Master asked, “How do you know this?”\n\nXi answered, “Last winter’s tenth month, the star of heavenly principle moved westward past the Pleiades. Since the first of this month, the melting winds have come thrice. The true qi of the east, shaped like a dragon-serpent, has transformed and advanced west—this is the sign of a great sage.”\n\nThe Old Master then smiled and said, “Well indeed! You know me, just as I have long known you.”\n\nXi bowed again and asked, “May I inquire as to the great sage’s name?”\n\nThe Old Master replied, “My name and style are vast, spanning kalpas beyond recounting. Now I am surnamed Li, styled Boyang, and called the Old Master.”\n\nThereupon, Xi prepared a seat in the official residence and made offerings, performing the rites of a disciple. The Old Master remained at the pass for over a hundred days, transmitting to Xi all methods of inner and outer cultivation.\n\nAt that time, the Old Master’s charioteer, Xu Jia, had long been in his service, contracted to receive a hundred coins daily. By the time they reached the pass, the debt had grown to seventy-three million coins. Seeing the Old Master depart for distant lands, Xu Jia hastened to demand payment. The Old Master said, “When I return from the western seas, I shall repay you tenfold in gold.”\n\nXu Jia, holding him to his word, followed to the place where the black ox grazed. The Old Master, wishing to test him, transformed an auspicious herb into a beautiful woman who walked to where the ox was pastured. With words, she beguiled Xu Jia, who, entranced, forgot his prior agreement. He then went to the magistrate and sued the Old Master for his wages.\n\nThe Old Master said to Xu Jia, “You have followed me for over two hundred years. Long ago, you should have died, but I gave you the *Tai Xuan Sheng Fu* to preserve your life until today. How can you forget this and sue me?”\n\nAs he spoke, the talisman flew from Xu Jia’s mouth, and his body instantly turned to white bones.\n\nXu Jia then kowtowed to the Old Master, begging forgiveness for his transgression and pleading for a chance at rebirth. The Old Master once more cast the *Tai Xuan Sheng Fu* upon him, and Xu Jia instantly revived. Xu Jia then repaid him with the owed silver and respectfully sent him on his way.\n\nOne day, the Old Master said to Yin Xi, “The ancient master was none other than my own form. Once, I transformed myself in Jambudvīpa, and now I shall return my spirit to the Nameless. I depart today.” Yin Xi kowtowed, entreating to accompany him. The Old Master replied, “I wander beyond heaven and earth, frolic within the mysteries of the unseen. The four directions, eight poles—above and below, boundless. How could you follow me?” Yin Xi said, “I would enter fire, plunge into the abyss, reduce my body to ashes, and forfeit my life—all to follow the Great Immortal.” The Old Master said, “Though your bones bear the marks of the Dao, you have received the Way for but a short time. How could you transform the kingdoms?”\n\nThereupon, he bestowed upon him the *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Its Virtue* and set a time: “After a thousand days, seek me at the market of the green ram.” With these words, he sat upon a cloud of radiant blossoms and slowly ascended into the sky. His light illuminated the dwelling, five-colored and profound, lingering long before vanishing. Yin Xi, his gaze fixed upon the clouds, wept in longing and named the account *The Scripture of Western Ascension*.\n\nYin Xi then withdrew from worldly affairs, composing nine scrolls himself, which he titled *The Master of Guān*. In the year *ding-si*, he journeyed west to seek the market of the green ram. The Old Master had ascended to heaven in the year *jia-yin*; by the year *yi-mao*, he had once more divided his body from the Palace of Great Tenuity and descended into the kingdom of Shu, born into the household of the Li family, officials of the court. Earlier, he had saved a green dragon, transforming it into a ram, its color like blue-green gold, which remained by the side of the newborn child, beloved and endlessly played with. Suddenly, one day, the ram vanished. The boy searched for it and found it in the marketplace.\n\nWhen Yin Xi arrived in Shu, he asked the locals in vain for the market of the green ram. Then, he suddenly saw a boy leading a ram and inquired, “Whose ram is this? Where are you taking it?” The boy replied, “My lady gave birth to a son, and he loves to play with this ram. It went missing two days ago, and the child has not stopped crying. Now that I’ve found it, I’m taking it home.” Yin Xi then instructed him, “Please tell the lady’s son that Yin Xi has arrived.” The boy went inside to relay the message, and the child immediately rose, straightening his clothes, and said, “Bring Yin Xi in.”\n\nAs Yin Xi entered the household, the halls and courtyards suddenly grew vast, and lotus thrones emerged from the ground. The child transformed into a body of white gold, several *zhang* tall, radiant as the sun, a halo encircling his neck, seated upon the lotus throne. The entire household was struck with awe. The child said, “I am the Old Master.”\n\nThe Great Tenuity is this dwelling, the True Unity is this body. Host and guest depend upon one another—what is there to marvel at?\n\nYin Xi, filled with boundless reverence, bowed deeply and said, “I never expected to behold the celestial countenance again.”\n\nThe Old Master replied, “I once detained you because, having newly received the scriptural instructions, you had not yet perfected your attainment. Thus did I await you here. Now you have preserved your form and refined your appearance, reaching the realm of true subtlety. Your heart is bound with the purple net, and your face radiates divine light. Your golden name is inscribed in the Dark Garden, and your jade tally resounds in the Purple Chamber.”\n\nHe then commanded the Five Elder Thearchs and the Four Poles’ Veritable Inspectors to confer upon Yin Xi a jade register and golden writ, bestowing the title *Master of the Literary Beginning*. His rank was elevated to that of the Supreme Perfected, above the Twenty-Four Heavenly Kings, and he was entrusted with the governance of eighty thousand immortals. From this time forth, he could soar through the empty void and attend the Dragon Chariot.\n\n**Li Babai**\nLi Babai, a man of Shu, was named Zhen. He dwelt on Five Dragons Ridge in Yunyang, living through the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties. Though he reached eight hundred years of age, his movements spanned eight hundred *li*, and the people of his time thus called him Li Babai. At times he concealed himself in mountain forests, at others he dwelt amid the dust of the marketplace. He also cultivated and refined himself in a stone chamber on Mount Hualin, and upon completing his elixir, returned to Shu. During the reign of King Mu of Zhou, he resided on Mount Jintang, where the people of Shu saw him through the ages, calling him the Perfected Lord of Purple Yang.\n\n**Ding Lingwei**\nDing Lingwei was originally a man of Liaodong. He studied the Dao on Mount Lingxu, later transforming into a crane to return home. Alighting upon a decorated pillar, he sang:\n*“There is a bird, a bird—Ding Lingwei,*\n*Who left his home a thousand years ago and has not yet returned.*\n*The city walls remain as before, but the people are no more.*\n*Why not study immortality? The tombs now bristle with weeds.”*\n\n**Guiguzi**\nGuiguzi was a man of the Spring and Autumn period. His surname was Wang, his given name, Ling. Once he entered Mount Yunmeng to gather herbs and attained the Dao. His complexion remained that of a youth, and he dwelt in Ghost Valley by the Green Stream. Su Qin and Zhang Yi came to seek his teachings, and after three years, departed. He left them a letter, saying: *“The two of you have achieved resounding fame, yet like spring blossoms that fade by autumn, your glory cannot long endure. Now you both cherish the ephemeral honors of morning dew, neglecting the work of longevity. You scorn the enduring pine and cypress, prizing instead the fleeting titles of a single day. Alas! A woman’s love does not last the night, nor a man’s joy outlast the wheel’s turning.”* Guiguzi lived among people for several hundred years, then vanished without a trace. His works, *The Jade Token* and *The Master of Ghost Valley*, circulate in the world.\n\n**Liu Yue**\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, there was a Master Kuang, named Xu, who cultivated himself on Mount Nanchang. A youth often came to visit him, his words and bearing extraordinary, so the master regarded him with wonder. He asked, *“I have observed your manner for some time. May I inquire as to your homeland and name?”* The youth replied, *“My surname is Liu, my given name Yue. I dwell to the left of this mountain. Below the mountain stands a stone, some two *zhang* in height. Knock upon it, and I shall receive you.”* The master followed his instructions and knocked upon the stone, which suddenly opened of its own accord, revealing a pair of doors swinging wide. A young attendant welcomed the master inside. After several dozen paces, two maidens in crimson robes with vermilion staffs appeared to lead the way. Gradually, pavilions and terraces came into view, their gold and jade hues shimmering in contrast. Rare birds and strange beasts roamed amidst extraordinary plants and trees. A perfected one, crowned with a jade diadem and girded with a vermilion sash and sword, came forth to greet him. The master wished to remain, but the perfected one said, *“Your hidden merits are not yet complete. A future meeting may be expected—there is no hurry to follow me now.”* He offered the master three cups of jade wine and a sip of the Longevity-Preserving Elixir before sending him out. When the master turned to look back, the stone he had knocked upon appeared as it had before. On another day, he knocked again, but there was no response.\n\n**The Old Man of Mount Tai**\nThe Old Man of Mount Tai—none know his name.\n\nThe Han Emperor Wu, during an eastern imperial progress, encountered an old man hoeing by the roadside. Though his appearance suggested a man of fifty, his face was like that of a child. A white radiance, several feet high, rose from his head. Marveling at this, the emperor questioned him. The old man replied, *“At eighty-five, I was withered and near death, my hair white and teeth fallen. A Daoist master taught me to abstain from grains, to drink only water, and to fashion a divine pillow containing thirty-two ingredients—twenty-four to correspond to the twenty-four qi of the year, and eight to align with the eight winds. Following his instructions, I reversed my aging, turning old into young. My white hair turned black again, my lost teeth regrew, and I could walk three hundred li in a day. Now I am one hundred and eighty years old.”* The emperor, admiring his method, bestowed upon him gold and silk. Later, the old man entered Mount Tai and would return to his village every five or ten years. After more than three hundred years, he never returned again.\n\n**Master White Stone**\nMaster White Stone was a disciple of the Central Yellow Elder. By the time of Peng Zu, he had already lived over two thousand years. He did not seek ascension but valued only longevity. He regarded the Golden Elixir as the supreme medicine, yet being poor, he could not obtain it. For over a decade, he raised pigs and herded sheep, amassing wealth of ten thousand gold, with which he purchased the elixir and consumed it. He often boiled white stones for sustenance, hence dwelling on White Stone Mountain and earning his name. At times, he ate dried meat; at others, he fasted from grains. He could walk three to four hundred li a day, his complexion like that of a man in his thirties. When asked why he did not seek ascension, he replied, *“Heaven may not be more joyous than the mortal realm.”*\n\n**An Qisheng**\nAn Qisheng was a native of Fu Village in Langye.\n\nHe sold medicines by the sea, and the people of his time all called him the \"Thousand-Year Elder.\" Qin Shi Huang summoned him for an audience, conversing with him for three nights. The emperor bestowed upon him tens of thousands in gold and silk, which he left behind at Fu Village Pavilion. In return, An Qisheng left a letter and a measure of red jade crow, saying, *\"A thousand years hence, seek me beneath Mount Penglai.\"* The First Emperor dispatched several envoys to search for him at sea, but before reaching Mount Penglai, they were always driven back by wind and waves. Thus, shrines were erected at Fu Village Pavilion and ten sites along the coast.\n\n**Dongfang Shuo**\nDongfang Shuo, styled Manqian, once left home for a year. His elder brother said, *\"You return but once a year—how can this console me?\"* He replied, *\"I merely journeyed to the Purple Mud Sea, where purple waters soiled my robes. I then passed through Yu Yuan to wash them, setting out at dawn and returning by midday—how can you say it was a year?\"*\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, he submitted a memorial: *\"Your servant Shuo lost his parents in youth and was raised by his elder brother and sister-in-law. Now twenty-two years of age, I stand nine chi and three cun tall. My mouth is like a strung pearl, my teeth like rows of cowrie shells. My courage is that of Meng Ben, my agility that of Qing Ji. My integrity is that of Bao Shu, my trustworthiness that of Wei Sheng. With such qualities, I am fit to serve as the Son of Heaven’s minister.\"* He concluded, *\"Your servant Shuo risks death to prostrate himself and make this known.\"*\n\nHis words were immodest, boasting of his own virtues. The emperor, admiring his audacity, ordered him to await imperial summons at the Public Carriage Office. Later, he was promoted to await summons at the Gate of the Golden Horse. When food was presented before him, he ate his fill, then concealed the remaining meat in his robes, soiling his garments. Though repeatedly granted bolts of fine silk, he carried them away bundled in coarse cloth. He once used his imperial gifts of money and silk to take a wife in Chang’an, only to abandon her after a year. He then took another woman, exhausting his gifts upon her, and all mocked him. Shuo said, *\"As I have said, I am one who flees the world while dwelling in the court.\"*\n\nAt times, when wine had loosened his tongue, he would sit upon the ground and sing:\n*\"Drowning in the mundane,\nThe palace halls suffice to escape the world.\nWhy must one preserve the body\nIn deep mountains, beneath thatched huts?\"*\n\nBefore his death, he told his fellow officials, *\"No one in the world understands me—only the great Wu Gong knows me.\"* After Shuo’s passing, Emperor Wu summoned Wu Gong and questioned him, but he replied that he knew nothing. The emperor asked, *\"What are your abilities?\"* Wu Gong answered, *\"I am somewhat skilled in astrology.\"* The emperor inquired whether all the stars remained in their proper courses. Wu Gong said, *\"All stars are in place, save for the Year Star, which vanished for forty years but has now reappeared.\"* The emperor looked to the heavens and sighed, *\"Dongfang Shuo was by my side for eighteen years, yet I never knew he was the Year Star.\"* He grew somber and disconsolate.\n\n**Zhongli Quan**\n\nZhongli Quan, a native of Yantai, later changed his name to Jue and styled himself Ji, with the Daoist appellation Wangyangzi and the sobriquet Master Yunfang. His father was a marquis serving as an official in Yunzhong. At the birth of the Perfected One, a radiant light stretched for several *zhang*, startling all the attendants. The Perfected One had a round crown and broad forehead, thick ears and long brows, deep-set eyes and a towering nose, a square mouth and full cheeks, lips and face like cinnabar. His nipples were widely spaced, his arms long—like those of a three-year-old child. He made no sound day or night, yet on the seventh day, he suddenly spoke, saying: *\"My body roams the Purple Palace; my name is inscribed in the Jade Capital.\"*\n\nIn his prime, he served the Han as a general. When his campaign against Tubo ended in defeat, he fled alone, losing his way in the mountains and valleys. At night, he entered a deep forest and encountered a foreign monk—hair disheveled, brow swept by a whisk, body clad in grass garments—who led him for several *li* before pointing to a village. *\"This is where Master Donghua attained the Dao,\"* the monk said. *\"General, you may rest here.\"* He bowed and departed.\n\nThe Perfected One dared not disturb the villagers. After a long while, he heard voices say, *\"This must be that garrulous blue-eyed foreigner.\"* An old man, draped in a white deer-fur robe and leaning on a green artemisia staff, called out loudly: *\"Is the newcomer not General Zhongli Quan of the Han? Why not lodge with the mountain monk?\"* The Perfected One, startled, knew this was no ordinary man. Having just escaped the jaws of tigers and wolves, he was suddenly filled with the longing of phoenixes and cranes. Thus, he turned his heart toward the Dao and sought the method of transcending the world in a single morning.\n\nThereupon, the old man transmitted to him the True Oral Formula for Longevity, the firing times of the Golden Elixir, and the Sword Arts of the Green Dragon. As the Perfected One took his leave and looked back, the village had vanished. Later, he again met the Perfected One of Huayang, who bestowed upon him the Taiyi Knife and Spoon, the Fire Talismans, and the Internal Elixir. Wandering to Lu, he dwelled in Zoucheng, entered Kongtong, and resided on the Purple Gold Four Eminences Peak. There, he obtained the secret formulas in a jade casket and ascended as an immortal.\n\n**Ma Chengzi**\nMa Chengzi was a native of Fufeng in Qin.\n\nMa Chengzi was by nature fond of tranquility and retirement, taking no delight in the bustle of worldly glory. He once sighed to himself, saying: \"Human life is but a fleeting spark—why cling so long to the dusty realm?\" Thereupon, he abandoned his home to seek the Dao, entering a stone chamber on Heming Mountain in Shu, where he cultivated and refined himself for over twenty years. Later, he encountered an extraordinary person who transmitted to him the Divine Elixir, saying: \"Qi is the Internal Elixir; medicinal substances are the External Elixir. Having obtained this and consumed it, you shall be numbered among the immortals.\" With these words, the stranger departed. Chengzi followed the method diligently, and thus ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**Huang An**\nHuang An was a native of Daiqun. Though over ten thousand years old, his appearance remained that of a child. He constantly ingested cinnabar, so that his entire body was crimson. He wore no clothing and sat upon a divine tortoise, which measured two feet across. When people asked how long he had sat upon the tortoise, he replied: \"It emerges once every three thousand years—I have already seen it emerge five times since I obtained it.\" When he walked, he carried the tortoise upon his back. Emperor Wu of Han, hearing of his strangeness, discussed with him the matters of emptiness, non-being, and the immortals, always deferring to him in courtesy. When the emperor performed the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai, he summoned Dong Ye, Li Ke, Meng Qi, Guo Qiong, and Huang An to ride together in the same carriage, calling them his \"immortal ministers.\" After the emperor’s passing, Huang An’s whereabouts became unknown.\n\n**Liu Haichan**\nLiu Xuanying, styled Haichanzi, was a scholar of the classics who served as prime minister to Liu Shouguang, lord of Yan. He was deeply devoted to the study of life and destiny and revered the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. One day, a Daoist suddenly arrived, calling himself Master Zhengyang, and sought an audience. Haichan received him in the hall with the rites due a guest. The Daoist expounded the essentials of the school of purity and non-action, as well as the key methods of the Golden Fluid and the Returned Elixir. When he finished, he requested ten eggs of a parrot and ten gold coins. Placing one coin upon the table, he stacked the ten eggs atop it in the manner of a pagoda. Haichan, astonished, exclaimed: \"How perilous!\" The Daoist replied: \"For one dwelling in the realm of glory and rank, treading the ground of care and calamity, the peril is far greater.\" Then, taking all the coins, he split them and cast them aside before departing. Haichan was profoundly awakened by this and immediately resigned his seal of office, left the court, changed into Daoist robes, and withdrew to the foothills of Mount Zhongnan. After completing his elixir, he underwent liberation by means of the corpse, a white qi issuing from his crown and transforming into a crane that soared into the heavens.\n\n**Fuqiu Bo**\nFuqiu Bo, surnamed Li, lived in reclusion on Mount Song. For twenty years, he consumed yellow essence, causing his hair to return to black and his fallen teeth to regrow. After a long time, his Dao was accomplished, and he ascended in broad daylight. He once composed the *Song of the Origin of the Dao*, which says:\nThe tiger crouches, the dragon too lies hidden;\nThe dragon hides only after the tiger has crouched.\nSimply complete the work of the River Chariot,\nAnd there is no need for defense or resistance.\nAll you disciples who study flying immortality,\nWildly deluded, you cannot abide.\nLeft and right, obtain sovereign and minister,\nThe four substances mutually cherish and protect.\nWhen the model of Heaven and Earth is formed,\nThe Perfected One will naturally attend to you.\n\n**Liu Chen**\nLiu Chen was a native of Kexian.\n\nDuring the Yongping era of the Han, Liu Chen and Ruan Zhao entered the Tiantai Mountains to gather herbs. They lost their way and could not return. After thirteen days, parched and famished, they spied peaches on the mountainside and together picked and ate them. Descending to drink from a mountain stream, they saw a cup floating toward them, within which was sesame rice. The two rejoiced, saying, “There must be people nearby.” Crossing the mountain, they came upon a great ravine where two women of surpassing beauty stood by the stream. Smiling, they called out, “Have Messrs. Liu and Ruan come to fetch the cup?” Liu and Ruan were astonished, yet the women appeared entirely unruffled. “Why have you come so late?” they asked, and invited the men to their home. On the southern and eastern walls hung crimson curtains and vermilion bed-canopies. The women ordered their attendants to prepare a feast: sesame rice, dried mutton, all exquisitely sweet. After the meal, wine was served. Presently, a maidservant presented peaches, laughing, “Congratulations on your new sons-in-law!” As the wine flowed, music and merriment filled the air. At midnight, each couple retired to separate canopies, where the women’s tenderness was beyond compare. After ten days, the men asked to return home, but the women reluctantly kept them for half a year. The climate and vegetation remained ever spring-like, and the songs of a hundred birds filled the air, soothing their longing for home. The women sighed, “Your karmic roots are not yet severed; that is why you have tarried here.” They then showed them the way home. Upon their return, they found their village in ruins, seven generations having passed. When they sought the women’s dwelling again, no trace could be found. In the eighth year of the Taikang era of the Jin, the whereabouts of the two men were lost to record.\n\n**Wei Boyang**\nWei Boyang was a native of Wu.\n\nWei Boyang was by nature fond of the Daoist arts and took no pleasure in official service. He thus entered the mountains to concoct the divine elixir. At the time, he had three disciples assisting him, though two of their hearts were not fully sincere.\n\nWhen the elixir was completed, he tested it, saying, “Though the golden elixir is done, we must first try it on a large dog. Only if it suffers no harm may we consume it; if the dog dies, it must not be taken.” Boyang then fed the elixir to the dog, and the dog immediately perished.\n\nBoyang said, “The elixir is not yet perfected—could it be that we have not gained the favor of the divine spirits? If I take it, I fear I may share the dog’s fate. What then?” His disciples asked, “Will the master take it?” Boyang replied, “I have turned my back on the worldly path and left my family behind for this. If I do not attain immortality, I would be ashamed to return. Death and life are the same to me—I shall take it.”\n\nBoyang consumed the elixir and died as soon as it entered his mouth. One disciple said, “Our master is no ordinary man. Though he died after taking the elixir, could there be a deeper purpose?” He too consumed it and died upon swallowing it.\n\nThe two remaining disciples conferred, saying, “We sought the elixir for longevity, yet now those who take it die. Better not to take it at all.” They then left the mountain to procure burial supplies for Boyang and their deceased fellow disciple.\n\nBoyang suddenly revived, having refined the wondrous elixir to perfection. He placed it into the mouths of the dead disciple and the dog, and in an instant, both came back to life. Thereupon, he took the disciple surnamed Yu who had consumed the elixir, along with the dog, and ascended as immortals.\n\nEncountering a woodcutter entering the mountain, Boyang wrote a letter by hand to thank the two remaining disciples. He once composed the *Cantong Qi* in two scrolls, its explanations appearing to expound the *Book of Changes* but in truth borrowing the hexagrams’ imagery to conceal the principles of elixir-making.\n\n**Zhang Daoling**\nZhang Daoling, styled Fuhan...\n\nZhang Daoling was the eighth-generation descendant of Zhang Liang. Standing nine feet and two inches tall, he had bushy brows, a broad forehead, a crimson crown, green eyes, a high nose, a square jaw, and eyes with three distinct angles. A ridge of bone ran from his brow to his crown, and his arms hung past his knees. With the bearing of a crouching dragon and the stride of a prowling tiger, he appeared solemn and imposing from afar.\n\nIn the tenth year of *Jianwu* during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of Han, he was born on Mount Tianmu. His mother initially dreamed of a celestial being descending from the Northern Dipper, who presented her with a fragrant rose. Upon waking, the room was filled with an extraordinary scent that lingered for a month, and she conceived from the dream. On the day of his birth, yellow clouds enveloped the chamber, purple qi filled the courtyard, and the room radiated light like the sun and moon.\n\nAt the age of seven, he mastered the *Dao De Jing* and the esoteric texts of the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*, delving deeply into their mysteries. Though he was recommended as a candidate of *Xianliang Fangzheng* and entered officialdom, his heart remained set on cultivation. He traveled to Shu, drawn to its deep valleys and verdant peaks, and eventually secluded himself on Mount Heming.\n\nAmong his disciples was Wang Chang, who studied astronomy and was well-versed in the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Together, they refined the Great Elixir of Dragon and Tiger. After three years, the elixir was perfected. Though the Perfected One was over sixty, after consuming it, he appeared no older than thirty. He then journeyed with Wang Chang to the northern peaks of Mount Song, where they encountered an emissary in embroidered robes. The emissary informed them, “Within the stone chamber of the central peak lie the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns* and the *Nine-Cauldron Elixir Canon of the Yellow Emperor and Grand Clarity*. Obtain and cultivate these, and you shall ascend to heaven.”\n\nThereupon, the Perfected One fasted and purified himself for seven days before entering the stone chamber. Suddenly, a resonant sound arose, and upon digging, he indeed retrieved the elixir texts. Through diligent refinement, he gained the ability to divide his form and disperse his shadow. Whether rowing a boat on the pond, reciting scriptures in the hall, resting against a desk while receiving guests, or strolling with a flowering staff chanting verses, all these manifestations occurred simultaneously, leaving others unable to fathom his true nature.\n\nIn the region of Fangling between Xicheng, a white tiger spirit delighted in drinking human blood, and the locals sacrificed a person to it each year. The Perfected One summoned the spirit and admonished it, causing it to vanish. In Zizhou, a giant serpent often spewed toxic mist, poisoning travelers who passed by. The Perfected One subdued it with his methods, and it ceased to harm others.\n\nOn the night of the fifteenth day of the first month in the *Renwu* year of Emperor Shun’s reign, the Perfected One awoke from a dream on Mount Heming to the sound of jade pendants tinkling and celestial music faintly echoing. Gazing upward, he saw a white chariot amidst purple clouds, within which sat a divine being whose countenance was like ice and jade, radiating a brilliance too dazzling to behold directly. A figure before the chariot addressed him, saying, “Do not be alarmed—this is the Most High Lord Lao.” The Perfected One bowed in reverence.\n\nLord Lao spoke: “Recently, six great demonic spirits in Shu have wantonly tormented the people, a grievous and lamentable state. You shall act on my behalf to subdue them and bring blessings to the living. Your merit will be boundless, and your name shall be recorded on the Cinnabar Terrace.”\n\nThen he bestowed upon him the *Zhengyi Mengwei Secret Register*, along with the *Three Clarities’ Collected Scriptures* in nine hundred and thirty scrolls. He also gave him talismans, cinnabar writs, and seventy-two volumes of secret formulas; a pair of male and female swords; and the *General Merit Seal*. Furthermore, he said, “Let us meet again at the *Ban Orchard* after a thousand days.” The Perfected One kowtowed and accepted the gifts. Day and night, he studied the secret texts and followed the methods in cultivation.\n\nAt that time, eight demonic marshals, each leading ghostly legions numbering in the tens of millions, roamed the mortal realm, slaughtering countless people and causing untold premature deaths. The Perfected One, bearing the mandate of Lord Lao, donned the *Mengwei Secret Register* and journeyed to Mount Qingcheng, where he set up a high seat of lapis lazuli. To his left, he enshrined the *Great Dao’s Primordial Heavenly Worthy*, and to his right, the *Thirty-Six Divisions of True Scriptures*. He erected ten *Spirit-Barring Banners* around the ritual platform, sounded the bells and struck the chimes, and arrayed the *Dragon and Tiger Divine Soldiers*. The demonic hordes immediately brandished weapons, arrows, and stones to harm the Perfected One. With a single gesture of his hand, he transformed them into a vast lotus flower to repel their assault. The demons then wielded over a thousand torches of fire, but the Perfected One raised his hand once more, and the flames turned back to consume the demons themselves. From afar, they cried out, “Master, you dwell on Mount Emei—why have you come to seize our abode?” The Perfected One replied, “You have wantonly harmed living beings, so I have come to subdue you. You shall be banished to the barren lands of the West by Lord Lao’s command. From now on, flee far away and cease spreading illness among the people. If you disobey, you shall be annihilated without a single survivor.”\n\nThe demon kings refused to submit. The next day, they rallied the six great demon lords and encircled the Perfected One with a million ghostly troops. The Perfected One drew a single stroke with his cinnabar brush, and the entire host perished. Only the six demon kings collapsed to the ground, unable to rise. They kowtowed and begged for their lives. The Perfected One paid them no heed and drew another stroke with his cinnabar brush, splitting the mountain in two. The six demon kings, unable to cross, began wailing piteously, swearing to dwell in the *Śāla Kingdom* of the West. The Perfected One relented, reversing his brushstroke to restore them. He then commanded Wang Chang to place a great stone as a bridge for them to cross. Still seeking to test their resolve, he said, “Let us each demonstrate our powers.” The six demons replied, “As you command.” The Perfected One entered fire and emerged stepping upon a blue lotus. The demon marshals, however, were consumed by the flames. The Perfected One entered water and emerged riding a yellow dragon. The demon marshals drowned in the depths. The Perfected One entered stone and passed through it unscathed. The demon marshals, however, could only penetrate an inch before the Perfected One exhaled a divine talisman, pointing with his left hand to slay them and with his right to revive them. The demons, now unable to distinguish life from death, transformed into eight great tigers and lunged at him. The Perfected One became a lion and gave chase. The demons then turned into eight great dragons, seeking to seize him, but the Perfected One transformed into a *Golden-Winged Peng* and pecked out their eyes. The demons conjured five-colored clouds to darken heaven and earth, but the Perfected One became five radiant suns, their scorching light dispersing the clouds. Exhausting their transformations, the demons were at a loss. The Perfected One then manifested a boulder weighing over ten thousand *jin*, suspending it above their camp with a lotus fiber. He commanded two mice to gnaw at the thread, threatening to crush them. The demons wailed in unison, swearing never again to harm living beings. The Perfected One then banished the six great demon kings to *Northern Deng* and exiled the eight demon marshals to the Western Regions. Some ghosts still lingered, hesitant to depart. The Perfected One intoned a divine talisman, sending it soaring into the heavens. In an instant, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning descended with a host of blades, and the demonic horde vanished without a trace.\n\nThe Perfected One then traveled to *Yuntai Mountain* in *Cangxi County* and said to Wang Chang, “This mountain shall be the site of my ascension.” There, he chose a dwelling to cultivate the *Ninefold Return* and *Sevenfold Reversion* arts. One day, he once again heard the tinkling of jade pendants and celestial music. The Perfected One straightened his robes and prostrated himself, beholding Lord Lao arriving with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, hovering among the clouds without descending. The Perfected One bowed again, and Lord Lao commanded a messenger to declare, “Your merits have earned you the rank of *Ninefold Perfected Upper Immortal*. When I first sent you to Shu, it was merely to distinguish between humans and demons to establish a realm of purity. Yet you have slain too many demons and wantonly summoned wind and rain, commanding spirits and ghosts, darkening the daylight with yin shadows and polluting the skies with killing intent. This is far from the Great Dao’s love of life. The Celestial Emperor has already reproached you for your transgressions, which is why I cannot draw near to you. Retire now and devote yourself to cultivation and repentance. I shall await you in the *Realm of Non-Being*, within the *Eight Radiant Palaces of Highest Clarity*.” With these words, the sacred procession ascended and departed.\n\nThe Perfected One, heeding the decree, relocated with Wang Chang to Mount Heming. He said to his disciple Zhao Sheng, “There are malevolent spirits there—we must go and eliminate them.” Upon arrival, twelve divine maidens greeted them with laughter before the mountain. The Perfected One inquired, “Where is the salt spring in this place?” The maidens replied, “The great spring ahead is the abode of a poisonous dragon.” The Perfected One inscribed a talisman, transforming it into a *Golden-Winged Peng* that circled above the spring. The dragon, startled, abandoned the spring and fled, leaving behind a salt spring. Later, the local people boiled its waters to obtain salt. The twelve maidens each presented a jade bracelet, saying, “We wish to serve you.” The Perfected One accepted the bracelets and, with a twist of his hand, merged the twelve into one. He declared, “I shall cast this bracelet into the well. Whoever retrieves it shall be my destined companion.” The maidens hastily undressed and plunged into the well, competing to seize the jade bracelet. The Perfected One sealed the well with an oath, saying, “Henceforth, you shall be well spirits, never to emerge again.” To this day, the people of that land suffer no harm from the divine maidens and enjoy the benefits of the salt well.\n\nAfter twenty more years of cultivation, the Perfected One once again took Zhao Sheng and Wang Chang to Mount Heming. One day at noon, a figure clad in black silk, girded with a sword and bearing a royal casket, approached and said, “By the command of the *Highest Clarity True Talisman*, the Perfected One is summoned to wander the *Orchid Park*.”\n\nIn an instant, a black dragon drew a purple chariot, and two jade maidens ushered the Perfected One aboard. In the blink of an eye, they arrived at the celestial gate, where a host of immortals paid their respects. After some time, two azure lads in crimson robes, bearing vermilion staffs, stepped forward as heralds, announcing, “The Venerable Lord has arrived.” Together, they ascended into the void and reached a palace of gold and jade. Someone addressed the Perfected One, saying, “You are to attend the audience of the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy.”\n\nThe Perfected One straightened his robes and hastened into the hall. After a while, the hall stirred as the azure lads conveyed to him the methods of the *Orthodox Unity Alliance of Might*, charging him to proclaim them through the generations as the Celestial Master, to exhort and guide the unenlightened, and secretly revealed to him the appointed time of his ascension. Having received his mandate, the Perfected One returned to Mount Heming.\n\nOn the seventh day of the first month in the first year of *Yongshou* under Emperor Huan, at the fifth watch of dawn, Chang and Sheng beheld the Venerable Lord descending in a dragon-drawn carriage from the heavens. He commanded the Perfected One to mount a white crane and journey with him to Chengdu, where he expounded once more the principles of the *Orthodox Unity Alliance of Might* and recited the *Scripture of the Northern and Southern Dippers*. When he had finished, the Venerable Lord departed.\n\nWishing to leave a divine trace, the Perfected One stood at the northwestern half-cliff of the Cloud Terrace and leapt bodily into the stone wall, emerging from the summit—thus forming two caves in the mountain. On the ninth day of the ninth month, in the Qu Pavilion Mountain of Chicheng, Baxi, the Celestial Emperor dispatched an emissary bearing a jade tablet to bestow upon the Perfected One the title of *Perfected One of Orthodox Unity* and revealed that the time of his ascension was at hand. The Perfected One then entrusted his eldest son, Heng, with the secret registers of the *Alliance of Might*, the *Capital Merit* and other sacred texts, the demon-slaying double swords, and the jade tablet and seal.\n\nHe addressed Chang and Sheng, saying, “There remains some elixir; you two may divide and consume it. Today, you shall ascend with me.” At noon, a procession of immortals arrived in full regalia, and celestial music accompanied the Way upon Cloud Terrace Peak. In broad daylight, he ascended to heaven. At that time, the Perfected One was one hundred and twenty-three years old.\n\n---\n\n**Xiao Shi**\nXiao Shi had attained the Dao and delighted in playing the flute. Duke Mu of Qin gave his daughter Nongyu to him in marriage, and he taught her to play the flute, imitating the cry of the phoenix. A phoenix alighted upon their roof, and the duke built the Phoenix Terrace for them. Later, Nongyu rode a phoenix, and Xiao Shi rode a dragon as they ascended to heaven.\n\n**Mei Fu**\nMei Fu, styled Zizhen, was a native of Shouchun. He served the Han as Magistrate of Nanchang. Witnessing Wang Mang’s usurpation of power, he sighed, “Life is my torment, form my humiliation. Knowledge is my poison, and this body my shackle.”\n\nMei Fu then abandoned his home to seek immortality, wandering through the mountains of Yandang and the southern peaks of Min. Upon reaching Mount Xianxia, he encountered the Perfected Lord of Kongtong, who transmitted to him the methods of inner and outer alchemy. The Perfected Lord said to him, “Your destiny lies at Flying Goose Mountain.” Thereupon, Mei Fu went and built a hut to cultivate and refine the elixir. Once the elixir was complete, he returned to distant Shouchun. One day, a purple mist floated in the sky, and jade maidens and golden lads descended bearing the *Shao* music, leading a simurgh. Mei Fu bowed to the music, bade farewell to his family, and ascended upon the simurgh. He was seen again during the Yuanfeng era of the Song dynasty and was enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of Shouchun.\n\n**Huang Chuping**\nHuang Chuping, a native of Danxi in the Jin dynasty, was fifteen when he was herding sheep and met a Daoist who led him to a stone chamber in Mount Jinhua, where he remained for over forty years. His elder brother, Chuqi, searched for him in vain, but later encountered a Daoist skilled in divination and inquired of him. The Daoist said, “There is a shepherd boy in Mount Jinhua.” Chuqi immediately went to see Chuping and asked where the sheep were. Chuping replied, “To the east of the mountain.” When Chuqi went to look, he saw only a pile of white stones. Chuping shouted at them, and the stones all turned into sheep. Chuqi then abandoned his wife and children to study the Dao and later also attained immortality.\n\n**Fei Changfang**\nFei Changfang, a native of Runan.\n\n**Fei Changfang**\n\nOnce, while tending to market affairs, Fei Changfang saw an old man selling medicine in the marketplace, who hung a gourd at the front of his stall. When the market closed, the old man would leap into the gourd. No one in the market noticed, but Changfang, observing from an upper floor, saw this strange sight. He went forward and bowed twice. The old man said, “Come again tomorrow.” The next day, Changfang returned as promised, and the old man took him into the gourd. Inside, he saw halls of jade, resplendent and grand, filled with fine wine and delicacies. They drank together, and upon leaving, the old man warned him not to speak of this to anyone.\n\nLater, the old man came to Changfang’s upper room and said, “I am an immortal, punished for some transgression. I must now depart—would you follow me?” Below the room, there was a small amount of wine for their farewell. Changfang had twenty men try to lift it, but they could not budge it. The old man laughed, picked it up with a single finger, and carried it upstairs. The vessel appeared to hold no more than a liter, yet the two drank from it all day without exhausting it.\n\nChangfang wished to seek the Dao but worried for his family. The old man, knowing his thoughts, cut a green bamboo and had him hang it behind his house. His family saw it and, mistaking it for Changfang, believed he had hanged himself. They wailed in grief and prepared his funeral. Changfang stood beside them, unseen.\n\nThen he followed the old man into the mountains, treading through thorns amid a pack of tigers. The old man left him alone, yet Changfang felt no fear. Later, he was placed in an empty room, where a rotten rope suspended a large stone above him. Snakes slithered forth, gnawing at the rope, nearly severing it, but Changfang did not flinch. The old man returned and patted him, saying, “You are teachable.”\n\nHe then made Changfang eat excrement, which contained three worms, foul and vile beyond measure. Changfang found it revolting. The old man said, “You were nearly perfected in the Dao, but this alone remains unfinished. What can be done?” Changfang asked to return home. The old man gave him a bamboo staff, saying, “Ride this wherever you wish, and you will arrive in an instant. When you reach home, cast the staff into Ge Pond.” Changfang mounted the staff and returned in moments, believing he had been gone only ten days, though in truth, over a decade had passed.\n\nHe threw the staff into the pond, and when he looked back, it had transformed into a dragon. His family, mourning his long death, were astonished and disbelieving. Changfang said, “What you buried was only a bamboo staff.” They opened the tomb and split the coffin, finding the staff still inside. Thereafter, Changfang could heal all manner of illnesses and lash the hundred ghosts.\n\nOnce, he fed a guest and sent a servant to buy fresh fish in the Song market. The servant returned in an instant with the meal prepared. Huan Jing had once studied under Changfang. One day, Changfang told him, “On the ninth day of the ninth month, your household will face great disaster. Make a crimson pouch, fill it with cornelian cherries, and tie it to your arm. Climb a high mountain and drink chrysanthemum wine—this will avert the calamity.” Jing followed his instructions. His family ascended the mountain, and upon returning that evening, they found all their cattle, sheep, dogs, and chickens dead.\n\n**Lan Caihe**\n\nLan Caihe—his origins unknown—would often wear a tattered, patched robe with a black wooden belt over three inches wide. One foot shod in a boot, the other bare. In summer, he lined his robe with padding; in winter, he would stand amid snowdrifts, his breath rising like steam. In the cities, he begged for alms, carrying a large clapper board over three feet long. Drunk, he would dance and sing, drawing crowds of old and young who followed to watch, seeming mad yet not mad. His songs, improvised on the spot, all carried the intent of immortals—none could fathom their meaning. When he received coins, he would string them together and drag them as he walked, sometimes scattering them without care, or giving them to the poor, or spending them on wine. Thus he wandered the world. Some who had seen him as children later saw him again in old age, his appearance unchanged. Later, while drinking atop a wine tower in Haoliang, he heard the sound of sheng and xiao pipes. Suddenly, he mounted a crane and ascended, casting down his boots, robe, belt, and clapper board, which drifted slowly away.\n\n**Master Clad-in-Hemp**\nMaster Clad-in-Hemp, surnamed Li, given name He.\n\nBorn with fine features and hair bound in childhood, as he grew, he came to loathe the world’s filth and decay. He entered Mount Zhongnan, where he suddenly encountered a Daoist who imparted secret teachings. The master warned him: *\"At the southern inquiry of Nanyang, on the sunny bank of the rushing waters, there lies a mountain spirit’s hall and grotto. Beside it, the divine will open your homeland—go there, and you may gather your spirit in the boundless vastness.\"*\n\nMaster Clad-in-Hemp sought the place and was guided by a woodcutter. He dwelled in the grotto for nineteen years. During the great drought of the Jin Yixi era, the local magistrate Zhang Shi led the people to beg for rain. Master Clad-in-Hemp replied that he had no such arts, but the supplicants persisted. That night, twelve youths appeared to him, saying: *\"If they ask again, simply agree.\"* Perplexed, he consented. The next day, heavy rain fell. The twelve returned to bow, declaring: *\"We are dragons. The Celestial Emperor, seeing your Daoist practice complete, has sent us to assist your transformative work.\"*\n\nIn the early years of the Liu Song Daming era, at the age of one hundred and one, he sat solemnly and achieved *shijie*—liberation through the corpse.\n\n**Ma Gu**\nMa Gu was the younger sister of the immortal Wang Fangping. During the reign of Emperor Huan of Han, Fangping descended to the home of Cai Jing and said: *\"You are destined for transcendence, so I have come to instruct you. But your *qi* is weak and your flesh abundant—you cannot ascend to heaven at once. You must achieve *shijie* instead.\"* He imparted essential teachings and departed.\n\nLater, Cai Jing suddenly grew feverish as if aflame. After three days, his flesh melted and his bones straightened. He entered his chamber, covered himself with a quilt, and vanished. Only a cast-off form like a snake’s sloughed skin remained. Over a decade later, he unexpectedly returned home and told his family: *\"On the tenth day of the seventh month, Lord Wang will come again. Prepare several hundred *hu* of wine for him.\"*\n\nOn that day, Fangping arrived wearing a *yuanyou* cap, riding a five-dragon chariot, preceded and followed by banners and insignia like a great general. When his retinue arrived, his attendants all vanished. After Cai Jing’s father and brothers paid their respects, Fangping sent someone to summon Ma Gu.\n\nSoon after, Ma Gu arrived. The entire Cai household saw her—she appeared about eighteen, her hair coiled atop her head with the rest cascading to her waist. Her embroidered robes shimmered with dazzling light. Once seated, she went to the kitchen herself, preparing delicacies like *pilin* jerky, served in vessels of gold and jade.\n\nAt the time, Cai Jing’s wife had just given birth. Ma Gu saw her and said: *\"Ah, stay back for now.\"* She took a handful of rice, scattered it on the ground, and it turned to cinnabar. Fangping laughed: *\"Ma Gu still plays childish games.\"* She replied: *\"Since I began serving the immortals, the Eastern Sea has three times become mulberry fields, and the waters of Penglai have grown shallow.\"* Fangping added: *\"The sages all say the seas will one day rise as dust.\"*\n\nMa Gu’s hands resembled a raven’s talons. Cai Jing secretly thought how fine it would be to scratch his itching back with them. Fangping immediately knew and lashed Cai Jing’s back, saying: *\"Ma Gu is a divine being—how could you think her talons fit to scratch your itch?\"*\n\nFangping departed, and Ma Gu took her leave as well.\n\n*Xiaoyao Xu Jing, Scroll the First* (concluded)\n\n*Xiaoyao Xu Jing, Scroll the Second*\n**Lü Chunyang**\n\nLü Yan, styled Dongbin, was a native of Yongle County in Pu Prefecture during the Tang dynasty, and was known as Master Pure Yang. When his mother was about to give birth, an extraordinary fragrance filled the room, celestial music floated in the air, and a white crane descended from the heavens, flying into the bed curtains before vanishing. At birth, his form was golden and his essence wooden, with the crown of a crane and the back of a tortoise. His phoenix eyes gazed toward the sky, and his brows extended into his temples. From childhood, he was exceptionally bright, memorizing ten thousand words a day and composing essays extemporaneously. Standing eight feet and two inches tall, he resembled Zhang Zifang, yet remained unmarried at twenty.\n\nWhile still in swaddling clothes, Master Ma saw him and said: *\"This child’s bone structure is uncommon—he is naturally beyond the mundane world. When you later encounter a hut, dwell there; when you see a bell, strike it. Keep this in mind.\"* Later, while traveling on Mount Lu, he met the True Fire Dragon, who transmitted to him the Heavenly Escape Sword Method.\n\nDuring the Huichang era of the Tang, he twice sat for the imperial examinations but did not pass. At sixty-four, while wandering through a wine shop in Chang’an, he saw a Daoist in a blue headscarf and white robe casually inscribing a quatrain on the wall:\n\n*\"Seated outside, I always clutch a jug of wine,\nLest my eyes ever recognize the starry capital.\nHeaven and earth permit one so nameless—\nA carefree man amid the mortal world.\"*\n\nDongbin marveled at the Daoist’s archaic and extraordinary appearance, as well as the transcendent spirit of his verse. He bowed and inquired after his name. The Daoist replied: *\"I am Master Yunfang, dwelling on Crane Ridge in Zhongnan. Would you follow me?\"* Dongbin did not immediately answer, so Yunfang invited him to rest together in the shop. Yunfang personally prepared the meal, but Dongbin suddenly fell into a deep sleep, pillowing his head. He dreamed he was a scholar traveling to the capital, passing the imperial examination as *zhuangyuan*, rising from a minor official to censor, then to the Hanlin Academy and the Secret Pavilion, assuming every prestigious post. He married twice into wealthy families, his children married early, and nearly forty years passed. He then served as prime minister for a decade, his power and influence overwhelming, until he was suddenly charged with a grave crime. His family’s wealth was confiscated, his wives and children scattered, and he was exiled to the southern mountains. Alone, he stood on horseback amid wind and snow, sighing deeply—until he awoke with a start to find the rice still uncooked.\n\nYunfang laughed and said: *\"The millet is not yet done—yet you’ve dreamed your way to Huaxu.\"* Dongbin exclaimed: *\"Master, did you know my dream?\"* Yunfang replied: *\"The dream you just had—its rises and falls, its thousand joys and sorrows—were but an instant in fifty years. What is gained is not worth rejoicing over; what is lost is not worth grieving. Only when one attains great awakening does one realize that the human world is but a grand dream.\"* Dongbin was deeply moved and bowed to Yunfang, seeking the method of transcending the world. Yunfang tested him, saying: *\"Your bones are not yet perfected. To transcend the world, you must endure several more lifetimes.\"* Then he departed gracefully.\n\nDongbin immediately abandoned Confucian studies and retreated into seclusion. From then on, Yunfang subjected Dongbin to ten trials:\n\n**First Trial:** Dongbin returned from afar to find his entire family dead. His heart held no regret—he merely prepared generous funeral rites. Suddenly, the dead all revived, unharmed.\n\n**Second Trial:** Dongbin sold goods in the market, agreeing on a price, but the buyer abruptly paid only half. Dongbin made no argument, leaving the goods behind and departing.\n\n**Third Trial:** On New Year’s Day, Dongbin encountered a beggar at his gate seeking alms. He gave money and goods, but the beggar demanded more, cursing and insulting him. Dongbin only smiled and bowed repeatedly.\n\n**Fourth Trial:** While herding sheep in the mountains, Dongbin met a starving tiger chasing his flock. He stood alone before it, and the tiger retreated.\n\n**Fifth Trial:** While reading in a thatched hut in the mountains, a woman of unparalleled beauty, her radiance dazzling, appeared. She claimed to have lost her way returning from her parents’ home and sought rest. She then made countless advances, yet Dongbin remained unmoved.\n\n**Sixth Trial:** One day, Dongbin left home and returned to find all his possessions stolen. He showed no anger, supporting himself through farming. While plowing, he uncovered dozens of gold pieces but quickly covered them, taking nothing.\n\n**Seventh Trial:** Dongbin bought copper vessels from a merchant, only to find them turned to gold upon returning home. He sought out the seller and returned them.\n\n**Eighth Trial:** A mad Daoist sold medicine by the roadside, claiming it would kill anyone who took it, though they would attain the Dao in their next life. Dongbin bought it, and the Daoist said: *\"Prepare your funeral rites at once.\"* He took the medicine without ill effect.\n\n**Ninth Trial:** During spring floods, Dongbin crossed a river with others. Midway, wind and waves surged violently, and all grew fearful. Dongbin sat unmoved.\n\n**Tenth Trial:** While sitting alone in a room, countless grotesque ghosts and demons appeared, some striking, some attempting to kill him. Dongbin showed no fear. Suddenly, a rebuke rang out from the void, and the spirits vanished. A man descended, clapping and laughing—it was Yunfang. He said: *\"I have tested you ten times, and you remained unmoved. You are certain to attain the Dao. Now I will teach you the arts of alchemy, to aid the world and benefit all beings. When your three thousand merits are complete and your eight hundred deeds perfected, I will come to deliver you.\"*\n\nDongbin asked: *\"Will the works of metal and wood transformation change?\"* Yunfang replied: *\"After three thousand years, they will return to their original nature.\"* Dongbin sighed: *\"To mislead people three thousand years hence—I will not do it.\"* Yunfang smiled: *\"With such a heart, your three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds are already fulfilled.\"* He then took Dongbin to Crane Ridge, transmitting all the secret methods of the highest immortals, along with *The Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure* and several grains of elixir.\n\nAs they finished, two immortals descended, bearing a golden tablet and a sacred talisman, announcing to Yunfang: *\"The Emperor of Heaven summons you to select immortals for the Golden Tower of the Nine Heavens.\"* Yunfang said to Dongbin: *\"I go now to answer the imperial decree. Remain in the world, cultivate merit, and establish virtue. In time, you too shall be as I.\"*\n\nDongbin bowed again and said: *\"My aspiration differs from yours, Master. I must first deliver all sentient beings in the world before I shall ascend.\"* Thereupon, Yunfang rose slowly upon the clouds and departed.\n\nHaving received Yunfang’s Dao, along with the *Heavenly Concealment Sword Method* of the Fire Dragon Perfected, Dongbin began his travels through the Jiang and Huai regions. Testing his numinous sword, he eradicated the scourge of dragons, concealing and revealing himself through transformations for over four hundred years. He often wandered among the Xiang, Tan, Yue, and E regions, as well as the lands of Liangzhe, Bian, and Qiao, unknown to all. He called himself the Returning Daoist.\n\nDuring the *Zhenghe* era of the Song, a malevolent spirit plagued the palace, appearing in broad daylight to steal gold and treasures. The imperial consorts and concubines observed pure fasts and offered sincere prayers, presenting memorials for sixty days. One day, as the emperor dozed, he saw a Daoist outside the *Shuhua Gate*, wearing a kingfisher-blue lotus crown and a purple crane-feather cloak, holding a crystal *ruyi*. The Daoist bowed and said: *\"Your servant comes by the Emperor of Heaven’s decree to subdue this spirit.\"* He then summoned a golden-armored warrior, who seized the spirit and tore it apart, devouring it nearly whole.\n\nThe emperor asked who the warrior was. The Daoist replied: *\"This is the *Chongning Perfected Lord* Guan Yu, whom Your Majesty has enfeoffed.\"* The emperor expressed repeated gratitude, then inquired about Zhang Fei’s whereabouts. Guan Yu said: *\"Zhang Fei has been my companion through countless kalpas, reborn in every life as a man. Now, he has been born to Your Majesty in the household of the Yue family of Xiangzhou.\"*\n\nThe emperor then asked the Daoist’s name. The Daoist replied: *\"Your servant is surnamed Yang, born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month.\"* The emperor awoke and recorded the dream, realizing it had been Dongbin. From then on, the palace was at peace. A decree was issued that all places where Dongbin was venerated with incense should bestow upon him the title *Zheng Miaotong Perfected Realized One*. His divine transformations and wondrous works cannot be fully recounted.\n\nLater, Yue, father of the Martial Duke, indeed dreamed of Zhang Fei’s rebirth, and thus named his son *Fei*.\n\n**Sun Deng**\nSun Deng, styled Gonghe.\n\nSun Deng dwelled in a cave atop the northern mountains of Jixian, weaving grass into skirts in summer and letting his hair hang loose for warmth in winter. Skilled in the long whistle and fond of studying the *Book of Changes*, he played a single-stringed zither. His nature knew neither joy nor anger. Ji Kang sought his company for three years, yet whenever he inquired of Sun Deng’s aspirations, no answer came. As Ji Kang prepared to depart, he asked, *\"Will the master truly say nothing?\"*\n\nSun Deng replied: *\"Do you understand fire? Fire is born with light, yet if it does not employ its light, its fulfillment lies in using that light. A person is born with talent, yet if they do not employ their talent, their fulfillment lies in using that talent. Thus, using light depends on obtaining fuel to preserve its radiance; using talent depends on recognizing truth to preserve one’s years.\"*\n\nJi Kang then requested to learn the zither. Sun Deng refused, saying: *\"Your talent is abundant but your discernment scant—you will scarcely escape the perils of this age.\"* Later, Ji Kang indeed became entangled in Lü An’s affair. Imprisoned, he composed a poem reproaching himself: *\"Once I felt shame before Xia Hui; now I feel shame before Sun Deng.\"* Sun Deng ultimately ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**Zuo Ci**\n\nZuo Ci, styled Yuanfang, was a native of Lujiang. He refined his thoughts and studied the Dao in the Tianzhu Mountains, where he obtained the *Elixir Canon* from a stone chamber. He was especially versed in the Six Jia and could command ghosts and spirits. With a mere thought, he could summon traveling kitchens and transform myriad forms. When Cao Cao summoned him, he was confined to a chamber and made to fast for a full year; upon emerging, his complexion remained unchanged.\n\nOnce, during a grand banquet, Cao Cao remarked, *\"Today’s gathering is splendid, but it lacks only the perch of Songjiang.\"* Zuo Ci then requested a bronze basin filled with water and a fishing rod, and at once caught a perch. Cao Cao said, *\"What a pity we have no ginger from Shu.\"* Zuo Ci replied, *\"That is easily obtained.\"* Fearing Zuo Ci might fetch it from nearby, Cao Cao quickly said, *\"The envoy I sent earlier to buy brocade should be rewarded with twenty additional bolts.\"* Zuo Ci assented, then tossed his cup into the air, transforming into a crane and vanishing. Moments later, he produced ginger from his sleeve. When the brocade-buyer returned, he confirmed that he had indeed received the additional bolts that very day.\n\nCao Cao once went to the outskirts with a hundred attendants. Zuo Ci provided each with a sheng of wine and a catty of dried meat, pouring the drinks himself; all the officials became drunk and sated. Cao Cao found this strange and inspected the cauldrons, only to find all the wine and meat gone. Displeased by his uncanny powers, Cao Cao had Zuo Ci seized to execute him. Zuo Ci retreated into a wall, vanishing without a trace. Later, he was spotted in the marketplace, but when pursuers tried to capture him, all the townspeople transformed to resemble him, making it impossible to distinguish the real one. Another time, he was encountered on the summit of Yangcheng Mountain; when chased, he fled into a flock of sheep. Realizing he could not be caught, Cao Cao sent a messenger to say, *\"I will no longer seek to kill you—this was merely a test of your arts.\"*\n\nSuddenly, an old sheep knelt on its forelegs, stood upright, and spoke: *\"Why send such haste to seize me?\"* Then, the entire flock of several hundred sheep transformed into sheep, all standing and saying, *\"Why send such haste? None can be taken.\"* None knew which to seize.\n\n---\n\nHan Xiangzi, styled Qingfu, was the nephew of Han Wengong. Free-spirited and unrestrained, he met Master Chunyang and became his disciple. After climbing a peach tree and falling to his death, he underwent *shijie* and returned to see Wengong, who urged him to study. Han Xiang replied, *\"My learning differs from yours.\"* He then composed a poem to express his aspirations:\n\n*\"The green mountains, the clouds, the water’s hollow—\nthis place is my home.\nAt midnight, I feast on jade nectar;\nat dawn, I chew crimson mist.\nMy zither plays the tune of the Azure King;\nmy furnace refines white cinnabar.\nThe golden tiger guards the precious tripod;\nwhite crows tend the fields of lingzhi.\nA gourd holds the workings of creation;\na three-foot blade slays demons and fiends.\nI can brew wine for border patrols\nand make flowers bloom in an instant.\nWhoever can learn from me\nshall behold the immortal blossoms.\"*\n\nWengong read it and said, *\"Can you truly seize the workings of creation?\"* Han Xiang then prepared wine, and it instantly became fine vintage. He gathered soil, and before long, a blue flower bloomed, from which emerged a golden couplet:\n\n*\"Clouds veil the Qin Ridge—where is home?\nSnow chokes the Blue Pass—my horse cannot advance.\"*\n\nWengong read it but did not understand its meaning. Han Xiang said, *\"One day, you will see its truth for yourself.\"*\n\nBefore long, Wengong was demoted to Chaozhou for his vehement remonstrance against the veneration of Buddhist relics. On his journey, he encountered a snowstorm, and suddenly a man braved the blizzard to approach—it was Xiang. *\"Do you recall the couplet from the flower?\"* he asked. Wengong inquired as to their location, and indeed, it was the Blue Pass. Sighing deeply, he said, *\"I shall complete the poem for you.\"* Thereupon, he recited from the *Collected Works of Han*: *\"A memorial to the ninefold heavens at dawn...\"* They lodged that night at the Blue Pass post station, and Wengong at last believed Xiang had not deceived him. As Xiang took his leave, he presented Wengong with a gourd of medicine. *\"Take one pill,\"* he said, *\"and it will shield you from miasmic vapors.\"* Wengong was overcome with sorrow. Xiang consoled him, *\"You will soon journey west, but not only will you suffer no harm—you shall also be restored to office.\"* Wengong asked, *\"Will we meet again?\"* Xiang replied, *\"The appointed time lies beyond our knowing.\"*\n\n**Duke Cao of the State**\nDuke Cao of the State was the younger brother of the Song Empress Dowager. Ashamed of his brother’s frequent lawless killings, he retreated into the mountains, where he devoted himself to profound contemplation of the mysterious principle. Clad in rough hempen robes and a kudzu-fiber headscarf, he went for weeks without food. One day, he encountered the immortals Zhongli and Pure Yang, who asked him, *\"We hear you cultivate self-cultivation—what is it you cultivate?\"* *\"I cultivate the Dao,\"* he replied. *\"Where is the Dao?\"* they asked. The Duke pointed to the heavens. *\"Where are the heavens?\"* they pressed. The Duke pointed to his heart. The two immortals smiled and said, *\"The heart is the heavens, and the heavens are the Dao. You have glimpsed your original face.\"* They then transmitted to him the secret art of returning to the true, and inducted him into the ranks of immortals.\n\n**Perfected Lord Xu**\nXu Xun, styled Jingzhi and known as the Perfected Lord, was a native of Nanchang.\n\nIn the second year of the Wu Red Crow era, his mother dreamed of a golden phoenix bearing a pearl in its beak, which fell into her palm. She swallowed it in surprise, and thus conceived, giving birth to the Perfected Lord. From childhood, he was open-minded and unburdened by worldly concerns. Once, while hunting, he shot a deer, which fell dead. The mother deer circled and licked its wound in grief. Moved by this, he cast aside his bow and arrows.\n\nDedicated to learning, he mastered the classics and histories, but his deepest passion lay in the arts of Daoist cultivation and immortality. Hearing that Wu Meng of Xi’an had obtained the divine formulas of Ding Yi, he journeyed to study under him, receiving all his secrets and devoting himself daily to refinement. One day, he purchased an iron lampstand and, lighting it at night, noticed that where the lacquer had peeled away, a golden glow shone through. The next day, he sought out the seller and returned the treasure.\n\nIn the first year of Emperor Wu of Jin’s Taikang reign, he was recommended as a Filial and Incorruptible scholar and appointed magistrate of Jingyang County, where officials and people alike revered him. During a famine, when the people had nothing to offer in tribute, the Perfected Lord transmuted tiles and pebbles into gold with an elixir, secretly burying them in the county garden. One day, he summoned those who had not yet paid their taxes to labor in the garden. As they tilled the soil, they unearthed the gold, using it to fulfill their obligations, and thus all was settled in peace.\n\nLater, a great plague struck, killing seven or eight out of ten. The Perfected Lord treated the afflicted with the divine formulas he had obtained, and soon, the sick from neighboring prefectures flocked to him. He planted bamboo outside the city walls and placed talismanic water beneath it, instructing the people to drink there—all who did were cured. Over time, sensing the coming chaos of the Jin dynasty, he resigned his post and returned home. Resting one day beneath a bridge grove, five maidens approached, each bearing a precious sword. Marveling, he accepted them. The maidens then accompanied him to his home, where they spent their days striking the swords in play. Recognizing them as sword immortals, he ultimately mastered the use of these divine blades.\n\nLater, the Great Wu Lord traveled to Huang Hall in Danyang and heard of the adept Chen Mu, who possessed many Daoist arts. Together, they sought her to inquire into the mysteries of the Dao. Chen Mu said: *\"Long ago, the Filial and Fraternal King descended upon the household of Lan Gong in Qufu. He told Lan Gong: ‘In a later age of the Jin, a divine immortal named Xu Xun will appear, to whom I shall transmit this Way. I leave behind the Golden Elixir and the Treasured Canon, the Bronze Talismans and the Iron Charter. I press them into my palm to await him.’ Many years have passed, and now I shall bestow them upon you.\"* She then chose an auspicious day, ascended the altar, and transmitted all the secrets of the Filial and Fraternal King to him.\n\nThe Perfected Lord, his heart set on the Way, visited Chen Mu every year. One day, she perceived his intent and said: *\"Do not come again, for I shall soon return to the Emperor’s realm.\"* She plucked a blade of fragrant grass, faced south, and cast it, saying: *\"When you return, build my shrine where this grass falls. A single visit each autumn will suffice.\"* The two lords returned and searched for where the flying grass had landed, erecting a shrine there. Every year on the third day of mid-autumn, they paid their respects.\n\nEarlier, when the Perfected Lord had gone to seek the flying grass, he rested at Zhenjing and witnessed villagers preparing lavish feasts to sacrifice to a deity. They warned one another: *\"If the offering is meager, the spirit will grow angry and bring disaster.\"* The Perfected Lord declared: *\"How dare such a demonic force act thus!\"* He summoned wind and thunder to strike it down, uprooting its sacred grove. The next day, he told the villagers: *\"The malevolent shrine has been driven away—no more sacrifices are needed.\"*\n\nSeeing the people suffer from fetching water from afar, he struck the ground before the shrine with his staff, and a spring gushed forth to aid them, never failing even in drought. Crossing the Xiao Shu River, he was warmly received by a riverside host named Zhu. In jest, he drew a pine tree on the wall of Zhu’s home, which thereafter brought the family double their usual fortune. Later, when the river overflowed and destroyed the embankment, sweeping away the market and homes, only the wall bearing the pine remained unharmed.\n\nPassing through Xi’an County, the Perfected Lord came upon a small temple. The temple deity appeared and said: *\"A flood dragon has been harming the people here. Knowing you were coming, it fled to Ezhu.\"* Arriving at Ezhu, he met three elders who pointed and said: *\"The dragon hides beneath the bridge ahead.\"* The Perfected Lord approached the bridge, brandished his sword, and rebuked it. The creature writhed in terror and fled into the great river, concealing itself in the depths. He then mobilized officials and soldiers to drive it out and slew it.\n\nAt the time, in Shangliao of Haihun, a giant serpent had burrowed into a mountain, its breath forming clouds that stretched forty *li*. People and livestock caught in its vapors were devoured, making it a scourge to the people. Hearing of this, the Perfected Lord sent his disciple ahead to the serpent’s lair. Wielding his sword and deploying a black talisman, he frightened the serpent into its den. He then issued a flying talisman to summon the local earth deity of Haihun to drive it out. The serpent emerged, rearing its head over ten *zhang* high, its eyes like torches, spewing venom into the sky.\n\nThe Perfected Lord whistled, commanding wind and thunder, and summoned divine soldiers to subdue it, rendering it immobile. He then strode forward, planted his foot upon its head, and cleaved its skull with his sword.\n\nThe disciples Shi Cen, Gan Ji, and others led the troops to strike the serpent, splitting its belly open. From within emerged a smaller serpent, several *zhang* in length. Lord Gan wished to slay it, but the Perfected Lord said, \"It has yet to cause harm—we cannot kill it without just cause. In one thousand two hundred and fifty years, it will become a scourge to the people, and I shall return to slay it then. As proof, plant a parasol tree before my altar; when its branches sweep the ground, that will be the time.\" He then foretold, \"One thousand two hundred and forty years after my departure as an immortal, within the borders of Yuzhang and the Five Mounds, eight hundred earthbound immortals shall emerge. When the small serpent becomes a menace, they will surely slay it.\" The serpent’s offspring then fled into the river.\n\nThe Perfected Lord said, \"Though the great serpent is destroyed, the *jiao* spirit remains unpunished. I fear it may seize an opportunity to flood the prefectural city. Let us return to the capital.\" With Lords Gan and Shi, he surveyed the city and encountered a youth who introduced himself as surnamed Shen, his manner respectful and his responses quick. The Perfected Lord told his disciples, \"The one who just left is no ordinary man—it was the old *jiao*, testing us.\" Tracing its path, they found it at the river’s edge in the prefectural city, where it had transformed into a yellow ox upon the sandy shoals. The Perfected Lord cut paper into a black ox and sent it to challenge the beast, instructing Shi Cen to lie in wait with his sword and strike when their battle grew fierce. Lord Shi’s blow severed its left thigh, and the ox fled into the city’s south. By the time it reached Changsha, it had resumed human form and entered the household of the merchant Yu Sijun.\n\nPreviously, the *jiao* spirit had coveted Yu’s beautiful daughter and, transforming into a handsome youth, sought an audience with him. Yu, admiring his talent, gave his daughter to him in marriage. For several years, they lived together, bearing two sons. Every spring and summer, the *jiao* would depart alone, returning in autumn aboard a massive ship laden with heavy cargo—plunder from vessels capsized during the floods. That autumn, it returned empty-handed, claiming to Yu, \"Bandits seized my wealth and wounded my left thigh.\" Yu sought physicians to treat it, and the Perfected Lord arrived in the guise of a healer. Pleased, Yu summoned his son-in-law, but the *jiao*, sensing danger, dared not emerge. The Perfected Lord followed him to the hall and thundered, \"River and lake *jiao* spirit, your harm to living things is grave! I have tracked you here—how dare you hide? Come forth at once!\" Cornered, the *jiao* revealed its true form, writhing as a serpent beneath the hall, where the divine soldiers slew it. The Perfected Lord sprinkled its two sons with enchanted water, and they too transformed into small *jiao*, which were likewise executed.\n\nThe Perfected Lord warned Yu, \"Beneath the *jiao*’s dwelling, the depths plunge immeasurably into surging waves. You must relocate swiftly.\" Yu moved to higher ground, and the site indeed collapsed into an abyss. The Perfected Lord then returned to Yuzhang, but the *jiao*’s remaining followers thrived, fearing his wrath. They disguised themselves as humans, claiming, \"Our family hails from Chang’an, generations devoted to virtue. We have long heard of the esteemed Master Xu’s divine sword and wish to witness its power.\" The disciples replied, \"Our master’s sword can split the heavens when pointed upward and cleave the earth when aimed downward. No evil dares stand before it—it is a treasure of gods and sages.\" The *jiao*’s followers said, \"There are things it cannot harm.\" The disciples teased, \"Only winter melons and gourds.\" The *jiao* party took this as truth and transformed en masse into gourds and winter melons, floating and bobbing upon the river. The Perfected Lord, recognizing their ruse, handed his sword to Shi Cen, who strode across the water and slew them all without exception. Thus, the water demons were purged, and the city knew peace.\n\nIn the second year of Emperor Ming’s *Taining* reign, the grand general Wang Dun marched his army inward, halting at Cihu Lake. The Perfected Lord and Lord Wu went to pay their respects, but Wang, swayed by other counsel, sought to detain them. At the time, Guo Pu was in Wang’s camp, and the Perfected Lord insisted he accompany them to the meeting. Wang, pleased, welcomed them and asked over drinks, \"I dreamed of a tree splitting the sky—what do you make of it?\" The Perfected Lord replied, \"It is an ill omen.\" Lord Wu added, \"A tree splitting the sky forms the character *wei* (未, ‘not yet’)—you should not act rashly.\" Wang’s expression darkened, and he ordered Guo Pu to divine the outcome. Guo said, \"It will not succeed.\" Enraged, Wang commanded his guards to seize and execute Guo. The Perfected Lord then cast his cup to the ground, where it transformed into a white crane that circled the rafters. When Wang looked up again, the two lords had vanished. Later, Wang’s rebellion failed.\n\nThe two lords returned to Jinling, intending to hire a boat to Yuzhang. The boatman lamented the lack of a skilled oarsman. The Perfected Lord said, \"Simply close your eyes and sit calmly—do not look around. I will steer for you.\" Silently summoning two dragons to flank the vessel, they set off. The boat gradually ascended into the air, soon passing over the summit of Mount Lu before arriving at the Golden Palace Grotto on Purple Cloud Peak. The boatman, bowing, begged for salvation. The Perfected Lord taught him to ingest sacred herbs, enabling him to abstain from grain and achieve immortality, whereupon he secluded himself in the mountain. The two lords each mounted a dragon and returned to their former hermitage, where for decades they paid no heed to worldly affairs, devoting themselves solely to the cultivation of the supreme Dao.\n\nIn the second year of Emperor Xiaowu’s *Ningkang* reign, the Perfected Lord was two hundred and thirty-six years old. On the first day of the eighth month, two immortals descended from the heavens, announcing, \"By the Jade Emperor’s decree, you are appointed Sovereign of the Immortals of the Nine Provinces and Grand Envoy of the Celestial Bureau of Astronomy. We also come to inform you of your ascension.\" They then departed in a cloud chariot. On the fifteenth of that month, celestial music filled the air as auspicious clouds drifted by, bearing feathered canopies and dragon-drawn carriages. Divine soldiers and attendants, jade lads and maidens, escorted the Perfected Lord into the dragon carriage. He ascended with his father’s clan and their retinue, while Xu Lie ascended with his mother’s kin and theirs. Forty-two members of their immortal households ascended to heaven in broad daylight, even their chickens and dogs following. For a hundred *li* around, a wondrous fragrance lingered for months.\n\n**Master Immortal Ge**\nGe Xuan, styled Xiaoxian, was a native of Jurong in Danyang. Known as Master Immortal Ge, he studied the *Elixir Scripture of Divine Liquids* under Zuo Ci.\n\nOnce, while dining with guests and discussing matters of transformation, a guest said, \"Master, would you perform something for amusement?\" Ge Xuan replied, \"Do you seek to hasten me? Do you wish to witness something?\" He then spat out the rice from his mouth, which instantly multiplied into several hundred grains that gathered upon the guests’ bodies. When someone asked him to open his mouth, a swarm of bees flew in, and upon chewing, they turned back into the same rice. He could point at stone statues to make them walk, or at toads, insects, swallows, and sparrows, compelling them to sing, dance, and keep rhythm as if they were human. When hosting banquets in winter, he would serve fresh melons and dates, and in summer, he would conjure ice and snow. When no one passed the wine cups, they would move to the guests on their own, and if the wine was not finished, the cups would not depart.\n\nEmperor Wu of Jin summoned him and asked, \"The people long for rain—can you bring it?\" Ge Xuan replied, \"It is easy.\" He wrote a talisman and placed it in the village shrine, and soon after, a heavy rain fell. Once, while traveling, he passed a spirit shrine. The custom was to dismount and bow a hundred paces before it, or else misfortune would strike. Ge Xuan, however, ordered his carriage to drive straight ahead. Immediately, a fierce wind arose, blotting out the sky with dust. Enraged, he declared, \"How dare a petty spirit act so!\" He wrote a talisman and had his disciple cast it into the shrine, whereupon the building burst into flames.\n\nPassing through Wukang, he saw a household afflicted by illness, where a shaman was performing rites to expel malevolent spirits. The spirit possessing the shaman drank with Ge Xuan but refused to partake himself. When the spirit spoke insolently, Ge Xuan rebuked it sternly: \"How dare you, wicked ghost!\" He commanded the Five Marshals to drag the spirit by the head, bind it to a pillar, and flog its back until blood flowed upon the ground. The spirit admitted its guilt, and the punishment ceased.\n\nIn Huayin, he encountered a scholar whose wife was a serpent spirit, having devoured countless people over time. The scholar did not believe him, so Ge Xuan transformed into a peasant plowing with a yellow calf. He led the scholar to an ancient well, where white bones filled its depths. Terrified, the scholar was then shown how to spy on his wife’s true form, and indeed, she was a serpent. Ge Xuan restrained and beheaded her, then gave the scholar a talisman to ingest. Afterward, the scholar purged countless worms and toads, and his life was preserved.\n\nOnce, while refining elixirs on Purple Beneficence Mountain in Jingmen, the weather turned bitterly cold. Ge Xuan’s feet were bare, and his robes were tattered. Two daughters of the Qu family, happening upon him, took pity and secretly crafted a pair of shoes, presenting them the next day. By then, Ge Xuan had already departed, leaving only warm ashes in his furnace. The sisters sifted through the ashes and found a single elixir pellet, which they divided and consumed. Thereafter, their spirits soared, and they neither hungered nor thirsted. The people of the time all said they had attained the Dao.\n\nOnce, while sailing with King Wu of the Eastern Wu kingdom at the mouth of the Three Rivers, a storm arose, and many boats were lost. The king lamented, \"Master Ge is a man of the Dao—how could he not escape this calamity?\" Suddenly, Ge Xuan appeared, walking upon the water. When he arrived, he still bore the flush of wine. He apologized, saying, \"Yesterday, Wu Zixu insisted on detaining me for drinks, which is why I have kept Your Majesty waiting.\"\n\nOn the western peak, he once pounded medicine in a stone mortar within a cliffside. A single grain fell, and a bird that ate it became immortal. To this day, on moonlit, wind-clear nights, the sound of a pestle can still be heard—this is the \"Pounding Medicine Crow.\"\n\nWhen the immortal Qin Gao heard that Ge Xuan had attained the Dao, he rode a pair of carp from the Eastern Sea to visit him. After drinking to intoxication, Qin Gao asked, \"When will I sober?\" Ge Xuan replied, \"When the white clouds part.\" The carp then turned to stone, and Ge Xuan gifted him a pair of cranes to ride home. The stone remains to this day.\n\nOnce, while boating with a guest, the guest saw a dozen or so talismans in Ge Xuan’s bag. He asked, \"Can these talismans be tested?\" Ge Xuan took one and cast it into the water, where it drifted downstream. The guest said, \"Even an ordinary person could do that.\" Ge Xuan took another and cast it in, whereupon it flowed upstream. The guest exclaimed, \"Remarkable!\" Ge Xuan cast a third talisman, which neither sank nor floated. After a moment, the upstream and downstream talismans converged in the current, and after a long while, he retrieved them.\n\nBy the riverside, he saw a man preparing to cook a large fish. Ge Xuan said to the fisherman, \"May I borrow this fish to present to the River Earl?\" The fisherman replied, \"It is already dead.\" Ge Xuan said, \"Even so, write a talisman on paper, place it in the fish’s mouth, and cast it into the water.\" The fish leapt away, alive.\n\nSuch divine marvels are too numerous to recount in full. Later, he ascended as an immortal.\n\nLady He the Immortal\n\nLady He the Immortal was the daughter of He Tai of Zengcheng County, Guangzhou. At birth, six hairs grew upon her crown. At fourteen or fifteen, she dreamed of a divine being who instructed her, “Consume powdered mica, and you shall become weightless and deathless.” She partook of it and thereupon vowed never to marry. She often wandered among the mountains and valleys, her movements swift as flight. Each morning she would depart, returning at dusk with mountain fruits to present to her mother. Later, she gradually ceased eating grain.\n\nEmpress Wu dispatched envoys to summon her to court, but along the way, she vanished. During the Jinglong era, she ascended to immortality in broad daylight. In the ninth year of Tianbao, she appeared at the Altar of Lady Ma, standing amidst clouds of five colors. During the Dali era, she manifested again at the Small Stone Tower in Guangzhou.\n\nMaster Zhang Guo\n\nMaster Zhang Guo secluded himself in Zhongtiao Mountain of Hengzhou, traveling between Fen and Jin, where he obtained the secret arts of longevity. He often rode a white donkey that could cover tens of thousands of *li* in a day. When resting, he would fold it like paper, its thickness no more than a sheet, and store it in his headscarf box. To ride again, he would sprinkle water upon it, and it would resume its form as a donkey.\n\nEmperor Taizong and Emperor Gaozong of the Tang summoned him, but he refused to rise. Empress Wu called him forth from the mountains, yet he feigned death before the Temple of Tuo Nu. It was midsummer, and soon his body rotted and teemed with maggots, so Empress Wu believed him truly dead. Later, someone saw him again in the mountains of Hengzhou.\n\nIn the twenty-third year of the Kaiyuan era, Emperor Minghuang dispatched the Court Attendant Pei Huan to Hengzhou by post-horse to welcome him. Zhang Guo arrived at the eastern capital and was lodged in the Jixian Institute, where he received the highest honors. The emperor inquired about the immortals, but he did not answer.\n\nZhang Guo was adept at breath control, going days without food. He drank wine several times daily. When the emperor offered him wine, he declined, saying, \"Your humble servant’s limit is no more than two *sheng*. I have a disciple who can drink one *dou*.\" Emperor Minghuang was delighted and ordered the disciple summoned. In an instant, a young Daoist descended from the palace eaves, appearing fifteen or sixteen years old, with a handsome bearing and graceful steps. The emperor commanded him to sit, but the youth said, \"Your disciple should stand in attendance.\" Minghuang was even more pleased and offered him a small *dou* of wine. The disciple declined, saying, \"I must not be given more than this.\" The emperor insisted, and as he drank, wine surged from the top of his head, knocking his cap to the ground. Suddenly, he transformed into a golden hairpin. The emperor and his consorts gasped and laughed, only to find the Daoist gone—nothing remained but the golden comb on the floor. Upon inspection, it proved to be the hairpin from the Jixian Institute, which could hold no more than a *dou* of wine.\n\nThe emperor said to Gao Lishi, \"I have heard that one who can drink leather without discomfort is an extraordinary man.\" As the weather was cold, he took some to drink. After three cups, Zhang Guo slumped and said, \"This is not fine wine.\" He then fell asleep. Soon, his teeth withered and shrank into his right cheek. He struck them loose with his *ruyi*, tucked them into his sash, and applied medicine. After a while, his teeth regrew, gleaming like jade.\n\nDuring a hunt in Xianyang, the emperor captured a large deer and ordered the imperial kitchen to prepare it. Zhang Guo said, \"This is a celestial deer, already a thousand years old. In the fifth year of *Yuanshou* during Emperor Wu of Han’s reign, I once accompanied him on a hunt in Shanglin Park. We caught this deer and released it.\" The emperor said, \"There are many deer, and eras have changed—how could it still live?\" Zhang Guo replied, \"When Emperor Wu released it, he marked it with a bronze plaque beneath its left antler.\" They examined it and found a bronze plaque about two *cun* long, though the inscription had worn away.\n\nThe emperor asked Ye Fashan, \"Who is Zhang Guo?\" Ye replied, \"I know, but if I speak, I will die. Only if Your Majesty removes your crown, washes your feet, and begs for my life will I dare to say.\" The emperor agreed. Ye said, \"At the dawn of creation, he was the essence of the white bat.\" Before he finished, blood streamed from his seven orifices, and he collapsed. The emperor rushed to Zhang Guo’s quarters, removed his crown, washed his feet, and confessed his fault. Zhang Guo slowly said, \"This child speaks too freely. If not punished, he might reveal the secrets of heaven and earth.\" The emperor pleaded earnestly, and after some time, Zhang Guo sprinkled water on Ye’s face, reviving him.\n\nThe emperor held him in even higher esteem and ordered his portrait painted at the Jixian Institute, bestowing the title *Master of Penetrating the Mysteries*. Zhang Guo repeatedly pleaded old age and illness, begging to return to Hengzhou. At the beginning of the *Tianbao* era, Emperor Minghuang sent an envoy to summon him, but Zhang Guo died upon hearing the news. His disciples buried him, yet when the coffin was later opened, it was empty. The emperor established the Qixia Temple to honor him. Huang, the Recluse.\n\nHuang the Recluse was a disciple of Ge Hong. When Hong dwelled in the mountains to refine the elixir, the Recluse often followed him. After Hong ascended as an immortal, he left the elixir between the pillar and stone of Mount Luofu. The Recluse obtained a single pellet, consumed it, and became an earth-traversing immortal. Later, a traveler wandering Mount Luofu lodged in a stone cavern. At night, he saw a man without clothing, his body covered in thick fur, and surmised he must be an immortal. He bowed twice and inquired of the Dao. The man paid no heed but let out several long laughs, their sound shaking the forest trees. Then he sang:\n\n*Clouds come—the myriad peaks stir,*\n*Clouds depart—the sky one hue.*\n*Two or three long laughs resound,*\n*Empty mountains, autumn moon white.*\n\nWhen the traveler returned and described the man’s appearance, it was none other than the Recluse.\n\nMaster Sima\nSima Chengzhen, styled Zimiao, studied under Master Pan, inheriting the arts of grain avoidance and guiding the qi. He traveled through famous mountains, and Emperor Ruizong of Tang summoned him to the capital. The emperor asked of his arts. He replied, \"In pursuing the Dao, one daily diminishes—diminish and diminish again, until reaching non-action.\"\n\nThe emperor said, \"For cultivating the body, this suffices. How does it apply to governing the state?\"\n\nHe answered, \"The body is like the state. Let the mind wander in tranquility, harmonize the qi with stillness, and move with things naturally, without private intent—then the realm will be well-ordered.\"\n\nThe emperor sighed and intoned, \"What more could even Guangchengzi say?\"\n\nChengzhen took leave to return to Mount Tiantai. Lu Zangyong pointed to the Zhongnan Mountains and said, \"There are many fine places within. Why must you go to Tiantai?\"\n\nHe replied, \"From my perspective, it is but a shortcut for official advancement.\"\n\nLu had initially hidden in Zhongnan and later risen to high office. Upon hearing this, his face flushed with shame.\n\nDuring the Kaiyuan era, Master Wenjing and Chengzhen attended the Thousand Autumn Festival vegetarian feast. After performing the midnight *daocheng* rites in the Hall of Longevity, they retired behind cloud-patterned screens to their respective couches. Faintly, they heard what seemed like a child reciting scriptures—each syllable clear and resonant as jade or gold.\n\nMaster Wenjing lifted his robe and crept closer to listen. He saw upon Chengzhen’s forehead a small moon, the size of a coin, its light illuminating the entire mat. Drawing nearer, he realized the sound emanated from within Chengzhen’s skull.\n\nReturning to his disciples, the Master said, *\"The Yellow Court Scripture* states: ‘Within the Mud Pill Palace, the Nine Perfected each have their chamber, a square inch in dimension.’ This must refer to Master Chengzhen.\"\n\nOne day, Chengzhen told his disciples, \"I have been summoned by the Lord of Eastern Florescence and must depart.\" Moments later, he vanished like a cicada shedding its husk. His disciples buried his robe and cap. He was eighty-nine years old, and his writings—including *On the Aspiration for Cultivating the True and Secret Essentials*—circulated in the world.\n\nWang Zhi\nWang Zhi was a native of Quzhou during the Jin dynasty. While felling trees in the mountains, he came upon a stone chamber where several elders were playing *weiqi*. He set down his axe to watch. One of the elders gave him an object like a jujube pit, instructing him to hold it in his mouth and swallow its juice, whereupon he felt neither hunger nor thirst. The elder then said, \"You have been here long enough; you may return.\"\n\nWang Zhi retrieved his axe, only to find the handle had rotted away entirely. Upon hastening home, he discovered centuries had passed—none of his kin or acquaintances remained. He returned to the mountains and attained the Dao. People often caught glimpses of him.\n\nTao Hongjing\n\nTao Hongjing, styled Daoming, was a native of Moling. His mother once dreamed of a green dragon emerging from her bosom, and soon after conceived. From birth, he displayed extraordinary conduct as a child. At the age of ten, he encountered Ge Hong’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* and pored over it day and night. He remarked to others, \"Gazing at the azure clouds and beholding the white sun, I feel no distance is too far.\" As he grew, he stood seven *chi* and seven *cun* tall, his bearing luminous and refined, with bright eyes and well-spaced brows. Each ear bore over seventy hairs, extending outward about two *cun*. On his right knee were several dozen dark moles, arranged in the pattern of the Seven Stars. He read ten thousand volumes, excelled at the zither and *weiqi*, and was skilled in cursive and clerical scripts.\n\nIn his youth, when Emperor Gao of Qi served as regent, he was summoned as a tutor to the imperial princes. Though dwelling within the vermilion gates, he kept to himself, shunning external affairs and devoting himself solely to reading. In the tenth year of *Yongming*, he removed his court robes and hung them at the Gate of Divine Martiality, submitting a memorial to resign his salary. The imperial edict granted his request. Thereafter, he settled on Maoshan in Jurong, establishing a retreat named \"Recluse of Flourishing Yang.\" He traversed famous mountains in search of transcendents’ herbs. Whenever he passed through ravines or valleys, he would sit or lie there, chanting and lingering without restraint.\n\nShen Yue, serving as governor of Shuyang, admired his lofty aspirations and integrity, repeatedly sending letters to invite him, but Hongjing never came. He was a man of broad understanding, modest and prudent, his actions attuned to the unseen. His mind was like a bright mirror, comprehending all things at a glance. In the early years of *Yongyuan*, he built a three-story tower, residing at its summit and severing all contact with the world. Only a single household servant was permitted to approach him.\n\nMar Yuan was skilled in archery and horsemanship, but in his later years, he abandoned both, content merely to listen to the sound of the *sheng* pipe. He had a particular fondness for the wind in the pines, planting them throughout his courtyard, and whenever he heard their rustling, he would delight in it as though it were music. At times, he would wander alone among springs and rocks, and those who caught sight of him all took him for an immortal.\n\nWhen Emperor Wu of Liang ascended the throne, Hongjing cited several instances from prophetic texts and omens that all formed the character for \"Liang,\" instructing his disciples to present them to the emperor. Emperor Wu’s favor and reverence for him deepened. After obtaining divine talismans and secret formulas, Hongjing believed that the elixir of immortality could be achieved, though he lacked the necessary ingredients. The emperor provided him with gold, cinnabar, and other materials, allowing him to compound the \"flying elixir,\" its color like frost and snow. Upon consuming it, his body became light. The emperor, too, experienced its effects and held him in even greater esteem, repeatedly offering official positions, all of which Hongjing declined. He once drew two oxen: one roaming freely among water and grass, the other fitted with a golden halter, driven by a man wielding a whip. Emperor Wu laughed and said, \"This man wishes to be a turtle dragging its tail in the mud—how could he ever be summoned again?\"\n\nThe state consulted him on every major affair, and he came to be known as the \"Prime Minister in the Mountains.\" Though he lived past eighty, his appearance showed no sign of age. Later, when Emperor Jianwen of Liang was stationed in Southern Xuzhou, he admired Hongjing’s noble character and, after retiring to the inner chambers, summoned him. Hongjing arrived wearing a *ge* headdress, conversed with the emperor for several days, and then departed. The emperor held him in profound respect.\n\nWhen his disciple Huan Yun attained the Dao and was about to ascend to heaven, Hongjing asked him, \"I have diligently taught and cultivated the Dao—could it be that some fault still delays my transcendence, while you, Yun, are sent to inquire?\" After Yun ascended and returned, he said to Hongjing, \"Master, your hidden merits are most illustrious, yet in compiling your *Materia Medica*, you have relied on creatures like leeches and other living things. Though your work benefits humanity, it also harms living beings. For this reason, your ascension is deferred for twelve years. Only then will you shed your mortal form and depart the world, becoming the Overseer of Waters in Penglai.\"\n\nHongjing then composed a separate *Materia Medica* in three volumes, substituting plant-based medicines for those derived from living creatures, to atone for his transgressions. One day, sensing his time had come without illness, he predicted the date of his death and wrote a farewell poem. He passed away in the second year of *Datong* at the age of eighty-five. His complexion remained unchanged, his limbs as supple as in life, and a fragrant mist lingered over the mountain for days.\n\n---\n\nPei Hang was a scholar of the *Changqing* era during the Tang dynasty. After failing the imperial examinations, he traveled to Ezhu, where he visited his old acquaintance, the former Chancellor Cui, who gifted him two hundred thousand coins. Pei took the money and returned to the capital, hiring a large boat to sail down the Xiang and Han rivers. On board, he heard that a woman named Lady Fan—a beauty of unmatched grace—was also traveling with them. Unable to catch a glimpse of her, he entrusted a poem to her maid, which read:\n\n*Once, though distant as north and south, I held you in my thoughts,*\n*Now, closer yet veiled behind brocade, you seem a goddess.*\n*If ever you ascend to the jade capital in the heavens,*\n*I would follow the phoenix and crane into the azure skies.*\n\nDays later, the maid returned with Lady Fan’s reply:\n\n*A sip of jade nectar stirs a hundred emotions,*\n*Ground to finest powder, the black frost reveals the cloud spirit.*\n*The Blue Bridge is itself a grotto of immortals—*\n*Why endure the rugged path to the jade capital?*\n\nPei read the poem but felt only shame and admiration, unable to fully grasp its meaning. Upon reaching Xiangyang, Lady Fan had her maid deliver a small casket to him before departing without a word. Pei searched everywhere but found no trace of her.\n\nLater, while passing through Lanqiao Station, parched with thirst, he dismounted to seek a drink. He came upon three or four thatched huts, where an old woman sat spinning hemp. Pei bowed and asked for water. The woman called out, \"Yunying, bring a bowl of water for the gentleman.\" Recalling Lady Fan’s poem, Pei was startled. Moments later, from beneath a reed curtain, a pair of jadelike hands emerged, holding a porcelain bowl. Pei took it and drank—its taste was beyond mere nectar. Returning the bowl, he lifted the curtain to find a girl of radiant beauty. Enraptured, he said to the old woman, \"My servants and horses are exhausted. Might I rest here awhile?\" The woman replied, \"Do as you please.\"\n\nAfter some time, Pei addressed her: \"The young lady I just saw is breathtakingly lovely, her beauty unmatched in the world. I linger here, unable to leave. I would offer a generous bride-price to marry her—would that be possible?\" The woman said, \"I am old and infirm, with only this granddaughter. Recently, an immortal gave her a dose of divine medicine, but it must be ground in a jade mortar and pestle for a hundred days before it can be consumed. If you wish to marry her, you must first obtain a jade mortar and pestle—gold and silk are of no use to me.\"\n\nPei bowed in gratitude and said, \"I will return within a hundred days with the mortar and pestle. I swear I will not offer them to anyone else.\" The woman agreed. Pei traveled to the capital and searched everywhere for a jade mortar and pestle. By chance, he met a jade merchant who said, \"I recently acquired one, but it will cost two hundred strings of cash.\" Pei emptied his purse, sold his servants and horses, and barely scraped together the sum. He then hurried back to Lanqiao, carrying the mortar and pestle alone.\n\nThe old woman laughed upon seeing him: \"In all my years, have I ever met such a man of his word?\" She agreed to the marriage. The girl smiled faintly and said, \"Though this is settled, you must first grind the medicine for a hundred days before we can discuss the wedding.\" The woman then untied a pouch from her sash and handed the medicine to Pei, who began grinding it. Each night, he heard the sound of pounding, and when he peeked, he saw a jade rabbit wielding the pestle.\n\nAfter a hundred days, the woman took the medicine and swallowed it, saying, \"I must enter the grotto to inform our kin and prepare the bridal chamber for Master Pei.\" She then led the girl into the mountains, telling Pei, \"Wait here a moment.\" Soon, carriages and attendants arrived to escort him. Before him stood a grand estate with vermilion gates towering into the clouds. The next day, immortal youths and maidservants led Pei into the bridal chamber, where the rites were completed. Overwhelmed with gratitude, Pei bowed to the old woman. He was then introduced to their kin—all of them immortals. One female immortal, her hair coiled in a cloudlike bun and clad in a rainbow-hued gown, was the girl’s elder sister. After Pei paid his respects, she said, \"Master Pei, did you not once share a boat with my sister from Ezhu to Xiangyang?\"\n\nPei bowed in shame and gratitude, saying to those around him, \"This is the younger sister of my wife—Lady Yunqiao, consort of Immortal Lord Liu Gang. She has already ascended among the loftiest transcendents and serves as a scribe to the Jade Emperor.\" The old woman then led Pei and his wife into Jade Peak Grotto, where they dwelled in towers of jade and chambers of pearl. They were fed the cinnabar elixirs of crimson snow and jade blossoms, and their bodies gradually grew pure and ethereal. Their hair turned a lustrous green, their spirits roamed freely, and they transcended to become high immortals. In the Taihe era, Pei’s friend Lu Hao encountered him west of Blue Bridge Post and heard the full account of his attainment of the Dao. Pei then bestowed upon him ten catties of Lantian jade and a single grain of Purple Mansion cloud elixir. Lu bowed deeply and entreated, \"Since you have attained the Dao, I beg a word of instruction.\" Pei replied, \"Laozi said: 'Empty your heart, fill your belly.'\" Lu remained perplexed, so Pei explained further: \"The heart teems with delusive thoughts, the belly leaks vital essence—thus the meaning of emptiness and fullness becomes clear.\" With these words, he suddenly vanished.\n\nSun Simiao\nSun Simiao, a native of Huayuan, could recite a thousand words a day by the age of seven. Dugu Xin, upon seeing him, remarked, \"A sagely child—but his capacity is too vast to be of use.\" As he grew, he delighted in discussing Laozi and Zhuangzi, and withdrew to Mount Taibai to study the Dao, refining his qi and nurturing his spirit in pursuit of the art of transcending the world. He mastered astronomy and delved deeply into medicine and pharmacology, ever devoted to performing hidden acts of virtue. Once, he chanced upon a shepherd boy who had wounded a small snake, its blood flowing. Sun removed his robe to ransom and save it. Ten days later, while traveling, he encountered a youth in white who dismounted and bowed in gratitude, saying, \"My younger brother was saved by your kindness.\" The youth then invited Sun to his home, exchanged his own horse for Sun’s, and together they sped away as if flying. They arrived at a walled city where flowers and trees flourished, gold and jade gleamed, and the splendor resembled an imperial palace. There, a figure in crimson robes and a black hat, surrounded by a vast retinue, hurried forward in joy to greet and thank him: \"Your profound kindness moved me deeply, so I sent my son to welcome you.\" He then pointed to a young servant in green and said, \"This child once ventured out alone and was injured by a shepherd. Thanks to your act of ransoming him with your robe, he lives to this day.\" He ordered the child to bow in gratitude, and Sun then recalled the incident of saving the snake. Quietly, he asked those beside him where he was, and they replied, \"This is the Water Palace of Jingyang.\" The crimson-robed lord ordered wine and a feast prepared, with musicians to entertain Sun. Sun declined, explaining that he abstained from grain and sustained himself with qi, drinking only wine. After three days of revelry, the lord presented him with fine silk and golden pearls, but Sun firmly refused. The lord then commanded his son to fetch thirty rare prescriptions from the Dragon Palace and gave them to Sun, saying, \"These will aid you, a follower of the Dao, in saving lives and benefiting the world.\" Upon returning, Sun tested these prescriptions, and finding them all effective, he compiled them into his *Thousand Gold Prescriptions*. Emperor Wen of Sui summoned him to serve as Erudite of the Imperial Academy, but he declined. Only when Emperor Taizong of Tang called did he journey to the capital.\n\nIn the third year of Yonghui (652 CE), Sun had already lived over a hundred years. One day, he bathed, donned his robes and cap, and sat upright, saying to his descendants, \"I shall now journey to the land of Nothingness.\" Soon after, his breath ceased, and though a month passed, his complexion remained unchanged. When his body was placed in the coffin, only his empty garments remained.\n\nLater, the emperor fled to Shu and dreamed of Sun requesting realgar from Wudu. He immediately ordered an imperial envoy to deliver ten catties to the summit of Mount Emei. There, they saw a man in a headscarf and coarse hempen robe, his beard and eyebrows snowy white. Pointing to a large flat stone, he said, \"Place the medicine here.\" When summoned, a memorial of gratitude appeared atop the stone. The envoy saw over a hundred characters inscribed there, which he transcribed as they vanished. Soon, a white mist arose, and the figure suddenly disappeared.\n\nIn Chengdu, a monk devotedly recited the *Lotus Sutra*. One day, a servant arrived, saying, \"The master requests the master’s recitation.\" Passing through misty peaks, they entered a mountain dwelling. The master, clad in rustic garb and leaning on a flowering staff, his ears hanging to his shoulders, burned incense and listened to the recitation. He then offered the monk a rattan tray with bamboo utensils, a bowl of forest rice, and several dishes of wolfberry and chrysanthemum. The monk ate, finding the food as sweet as ambrosia. The master also gave him a string of coins, and the servant escorted him to the road’s end. The monk asked, \"What is the master’s surname?\" \"Sun,\" he replied. \"And his given name?\" The servant wrote two characters in his palm: *Sīmiǎo*. The monk was startled; when he looked again, the servant had vanished, and the coins had turned to gold. From that day, the monk felt light and free of illness, though none knew his whereabouts thereafter.\n\n**Tan Qiao**\nTan Qiao, styled Jingsheng, was precocious in his youth, mastering all texts he read, but he favored the *Biographies of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi*. One day, he informed his parents of his intent to travel to Mount Zhongnan and study under a Daoist master on Mount Song. After more than a decade, he attained the arts of grain avoidance and qi cultivation. Often wandering while intoxicated, he wore a sable coat in summer and a plain cloth robe in winter. Once, in a snowstorm, others thought him dead, but he remained warm and serene. Though he seemed deranged, he would chant as he walked:\n*A thread becomes the Yangtze, a fan the sky,\nStraw sandals cast aside by the eastern sea.\nThe path to Penglai is not far—\nJust ahead, where Tan leans on his staff.*\n\nLater, he resided on Mount Heng, refining the elixir. After consuming it, he ascended as an immortal.\n\n**Xu Xuanping**\nXu Xuanping was a native of She County in Xin’an. During the Jingyun era (710–711 CE) of Emperor Ruizong of Tang, he secluded himself in a southern valley of Chengyang Mountain, building a hut to dwell in. He did not cultivate his appearance or consume medicinal herbs, yet his complexion remained that of a man in his forties. He often carried firewood to sell in the market, his carrying pole always bearing a gourd and a crooked bamboo staff. When drunk, he would stagger home, singing:\n*With firewood on my back, I set out at dawn,\nBuying wine, I return at dusk.\nIf you ask where I live,\nI vanish into the clouds, into the emerald peaks.*\n\nFor over thirty years, he came and went, sometimes aiding those in peril or relieving suffering. Scholars sought him but never found him; they only saw poems inscribed on his hut’s walls:\n*For thirty years I’ve lived in seclusion,\nBuilding my hut atop the southern peak.\nIn the still night, I face the bright moon;\nAt leisure, I drink from the jade-green spring.\nWoodcutters sing on the ridges,\nValley birds play before the cliffs.\nJoyful, I forget my age,\nUnmindful of the passing years.*\n\nDuring the Tianbao era (742–756 CE), Li Bai learned that Xu was an immortal and traveled to Xin’an to seek him, but to no avail. He left a poem on the hut’s wall:\n*I chant poems of the posthouse,\nCome to seek the immortal’s abode.\nMisty peaks obscure the heights,\nCloudy forests veil the void.\nPeering inside, all is desolate;\nLeaning on my staff, I hesitate.\nHe must have transformed into a crane,\nReturning after a thousand years.*\n\nWhen Xu returned and saw the poem, he inscribed his own reply:\n*A pond of lotus leaves, endless robes,\nTwo acres of Solomon’s seal, ample food.\nAgain, men come seeking me—\nI must move my hut deeper into the wilds.*\n\nHis hut was soon consumed by wildfire, and his traces vanished. Over a century later, in the twelfth year of Xiantong (871 CE) under Emperor Yizong, a maidservant of Xu Mingru entered the mountains to gather firewood. Alone in the southern hills, she saw a man sitting on a stone, eating a peach. He asked, \"Are you the maidservant of Xu Mingru?\" She replied, \"Yes.\" \"I am Mingru’s ancestor, Xu Xuanping,\" he said. \"Return and tell Mingru I dwell in these mountains. Take this peach, but eat it here—do not carry it out. The mountain spirit cherishes these peaches, and tigers and wolves abound.\" The maid ate it, finding it delicious, and finished it in moments. He sent her back with the woodcutters, and she found their loads strangely light. Upon returning home, she recounted meeting her ancestor Xu Xuanping in the mountains. Mingru, enraged that she had uttered his ancestor’s name, seized a staff to strike her. As the staff rose, the maid’s body ascended, vanishing without a trace. Later, someone entering the mountains saw the maid with a youthful face, clad in tree bark, moving swiftly as if flying. She entered the deep forest and disappeared.\n\n**Xuan Zhenzi**\nZhang Zhihe, styled Butong, was a native of Jinhua in Tang. His mother dreamed of a maple growing from her belly before his birth. Emperor Suzong, recognizing his brilliance, granted him the name Zhihe and appointed him to the Hanlin Academy. After his parents’ deaths, he withdrew from office, roaming rivers and lakes. He styled himself the \"Fisherman of Mist and Haze\" and later, Xuan Zhenzi. He fished without bait, for his aim was not the catch. He could drink three *dou* of wine without intoxication, preserving his true nature and cultivating qi. He slept in snow without feeling cold and entered water without getting wet. When drunk, he would spread a mat upon the water, sitting alone to drink. The mat moved like a boat, and soon clouds and cranes circled him before alighting. He then mounted a crane and ascended.\n\n**Xuan Yuanji**\nXuan Yuanji’s origins are unknown. Legends claim he lived for centuries without aging, his eyes emitting beams several *zhang* long even in darkness. When he gathered herbs in the mountains, venomous dragons and fierce beasts followed to guard him. If a hundred households invited him to a vegetarian feast, he would divide himself to attend each. When drinking with others, he would produce a small flask from his sleeve, holding only two *sheng*. Yet when poured for guests, it never emptied, even after a full day, while he himself drank a hundred *sheng* without intoxication.\n\nWhen he encountered the sick, he would brush them with a cloth towel, and they would recover at once. Emperor Xuanzong summoned him to court and asked whether longevity could be attained. He replied: \"Cut off sensual pleasures, moderate rich flavors, and unite joy with the Dao. Bestow virtue without partiality, and naturally you will merge your power with Heaven and Earth, your brilliance equaling the sun and moon—then shall you attain long life and enduring vision.\"\n\nAs he withdrew, the emperor covered a white magpie with a golden basin and ordered an attendant to test him. Xuan Yuanji said: \"How could Your Majesty again make this old man divine what is hidden? The white magpie beneath the basin should be released at once.\" The emperor laughed and said: \"The master knew it early on.\" He then commanded him to sit before the imperial couch and ordered palace ladies to serve tea. Xuan Yuanji’s appearance was ancient yet plainly clad, and some of the ladies laughed at him. One, with raven hair and crimson lips, was only sixteen—suddenly she transformed into an old woman, her hair instantly gray, and wept without cease. The emperor ordered her to apologize, and she immediately reverted to her former self.\n\nThe capital had never seen indigo onions or lychee blossoms. When the emperor mentioned this, both flowers appeared in an instant, their branches and leaves fresh as if newly picked. Among those seated was a minister’s son, to whom Xuan Yuanji said: \"In the mountains, I have fruits of even finer flavor.\" The emperor replied: \"There is no way to obtain them.\"\n\nXuan Yuanji then took the emperor’s green jade bowl, covered it with a jeweled tray, and in an instant, the tray was filled to the brim with lychees. The emperor tasted them and sighed, \"Their beauty is beyond compare.\" He then asked, \"How many years shall I reign as Son of Heaven?\" Xuan Yuanji took up a brush and wrote *forty years*, though the character for *ten* stood alone. The emperor laughed, \"How could I dare hope for forty years?\" After some time, Xuan Yuanji took leave to return to the mountains, and the emperor ordered an imperial attendant to see him off. Each time he was seen drawing coins from a cloth pouch to give to others, by the time he reached Jiangling, he had already bestowed hundreds of thousands, yet the pouch remained inexhaustible. Before reaching the mountains, he suddenly vanished. Soon after, a report came from Nanhai: the master had already returned to Mount Luofu. And indeed, the emperor’s reign lasted only forty years.\n\n**Chen Xiyi**\nChen Tuo, styled Tunan and known as Fuyao Zi, was a native of Zhenyuan in Bozhou. At birth, he could not speak, but at four or five years old, while playing by the Wo River, a woman in blue robes took him into her arms and nursed him—whereupon he began to speak, his intelligence surpassing others. As he grew, he mastered the classics and histories at a glance. The master said, \"What I have studied thus far suffices only to remember names. I shall journey to Mount Tai to discuss the Dharma of transcending the world with Anqi and Huangshi. How could I grease the wheels of the world and drown in the endless cycle of birth and death?\" He then dispersed his family’s wealth, keeping only an iron pot before departing.\n\nDuring the Liang and Tang dynasties, scholar-officials cherished his pure influence, and though some met him and beheld auspicious stars and clouds, the master engaged with none. Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang personally summoned him with a handwritten edict. When the master arrived, he made a long bow but did not kneel. Mingzong treated him with even greater reverence and bestowed upon him three palace ladies. The master composed a poem in thanks:\n\n*Snow for flesh and jade for cheeks, / Grateful for the king’s gift so meek.*\n*The recluse stirs not the Wu Gorge dream, / In vain the clouds and rain descend from Yang Terrace.*\n\nHe then departed at his leisure.\n\nHe concealed himself in the Nine Stone Crags of Mount Wudang, practicing qi absorption and grain avoidance for over twenty years. Later, he moved to Mount Hua, by which time he was already over seventy. He would often shut his door and lie abed for months without rising.\n\nDuring the Xiande reign of Emperor Shizong of Zhou, a woodcutter on the mountain’s foothills came upon remains covered in dust. Drawing near, he saw it was the master. After a long while, the master stirred and said, “Why disturb my deep slumber?”\n\nLater, Emperor Shizong summoned him and bestowed the title Master of White Clouds. One day, while riding a donkey through Huayin, he heard that Emperor Taizu of Song had ascended the throne. Clapping his hands, he laughed loudly and said, “The realm is settled from this day forth.” When Taizu summoned him, he did not go; when summoned again, he declined, saying, *“Ninefold immortal edicts—let not the vermilion phoenix bear them. A heart untamed by the world has already been detained by the white clouds.”*\n\nIn the early years of Emperor Taizong, he finally answered the summons but requested only a quiet chamber. He was granted residence at Jianlong Abbey, where he slept soundly for over a month before rising. Upon departing, he was given the title Master of Profound Repose.\n\nOne day, he instructed his disciples to hew a stone chamber in Zhangchao Valley. When it was complete, the master went to inspect it and said, “Shall I return here?” Then, propping his cheek upon his left hand, he passed away.\n\nSeven days passed, yet his complexion remained unchanged and his limbs still warm. Five-colored clouds sealed the valley’s mouth, lingering for over a month without dissipating. He was one hundred eighteen years old.\n\nEarlier, when war raged, the mother of Taizu carried Taizu and Taizong in a basket to evade chaos. The master encountered them and immediately sang:\n*“Say not that the realm lacks an emperor now—\nThe Son of Heaven is borne upon a shoulder’s pole.”*\n\nLater, he came upon Taizu, Taizong, and Zhao Pu strolling through Chang’an’s market. Entering a wineshop, Pu seated himself to the right of Taizu and Taizong. The master said, *“You are but a minor star in the Purple Tenuity Palace—how dare you take the higher seat?”*\n\nWhen Chong Fang first followed the master, the master told him, *“You shall meet an enlightened ruler, and your name will resound throughout the land. Yet alas, in all heaven and earth, no flawless reputation exists. When your name rises, some thing will surely mar it—beware.”* In his later years, Fang indeed lost his moral purity, just as foretold.\n\nThere was a man named Guo Hang who, in his youth, lived in Huayin and once lodged beneath the abbey. In the dead of night, the master called out for him to return home at once, then accompanied him a mile or two. Someone wailed the news of his mother’s death. The master gave him medicine, urging, *“Hasten—she may yet be saved.”* Upon arrival, they administered the draught, and she revived.\n\nThe magistrate of Huayin, Wang Mu, asked the master, *“Where do you dwell among these streams and crags, and in what chamber?”* The master laughed and chanted:\n*“High on Mount Hua stands my palace,\nStepping forth, I ride the dawn wind through empty skies.\nNo golden locks secure its pavilions—\nWhite clouds seal the way when I return.”*\n\nOne day, a visitor called upon the master, only to find him asleep. Beside him stood an extraordinary figure, listening to his breath and marking it with a black brush—ink scrawled across the page, indecipherable. The guest, astonished, asked what he was doing. The man replied, *“This is the master’s ‘Huaxu Tune,’ his ‘Primal Chaos Score.’”*\n\nThe master once met the Hairy Maiden, who presented him with a poem.\n\nThe poem reads:\n*“The medicinal sprouts fall short of the bamboo,\nYet I ascend still higher to perilous peaks.\nTurning back, I point the way home—\nTogether we enter the emerald haze.”*\n\nEmperor Taizong, hearing the master was skilled in physiognomy, dispatched him to the Southern Office. Upon seeing Zhenzong at the gate, the master hastily returned. Asked the reason, he replied, *“The servants and attendants are all generals and ministers—why need I see the king?”* Thereupon, the deliberations to establish the heir apparent were settled.\n\nThe master transmitted the arts of the *Yi*’s numerology to Mu Bochang, who passed them to Li Tingzhi. Li, in turn, taught Shao Kangjie. He also transmitted the study of images to Zhong Fang, who taught Xu Jian of Lujiang. Xu taught Fan Kua, and to this day, fragments of their legacy endure.\n\n**Master Lei the Recluse**\nMaster Lei the Recluse, whose given name was Ben, was unrestrained and peerless from youth. As he grew, he studied for the imperial examinations but abandoned them after two attempts. He would sit in silence all day, and some mocked him as *“the foolish old man.”* He retorted, *“I would never trade my folly for your pedantry.”* One day, he entrusted his son to a guardian and departed on a journey, never to return.\n\nDuring the Yuanyou era of the Song, an official traveling to Mount Luofu encountered the master seated beneath a tree, chanting a quatrain:\n*“Thirty years of coming and going,\nYet no trace of me lingers in the world of men.\nMy work complete, my path fulfilled, I ascend to heaven—\nTurning back, the moon atop the mountain is full and round.”*\n\n**Ma Ziran**\nMa Xiang, styled Ziran, devoted himself to the classics and history and excelled in literature. He once roamed beyond the world with Daoist companions. In Huzhou, he fell drunk into the Book Brook and emerged a day later, his robes untouched by moisture, claiming he had been summoned to drink with Xiang Yu.\n\nHe pointed at the brook’s waters and made them flow backward; he pointed at willow trees and made them drift with the current to and fro; he pointed at a bridge and made it break, then mend. No minor art was beyond his power. When people sought his help for ailments, Ma used no medicine—only striking the afflicted spot with his bamboo staff, or pointing at it while blowing on the staff’s tip to produce a thunderous roar, and the illness would vanish. If offered silk in gratitude, he firmly declined. If pressed, he would distribute it among the poor.\n\nHe ascended Hangzhou’s Mount Taiwang and composed a poem:\n\n*Where to seek the first division of the Great One?*\n*Only the reckoning remains, shifting mortal hearts.*\n*The sun and moon of the nine heavens change dawn and dusk;*\n*The rivers and mountains of ten thousand li endure from ancient times to now.*\n*Wind stirs the water’s gleam, swallowing distant shores;*\n*Mist thickens twice, engulfing the high forests.*\n*Qin Shi Huang’s foolish scheme to drive away mountains—*\n*The boundless sea only grows deeper still.*\n\nLater, he returned home to visit his elder brother, who happened to be out. He said to his sister-in-law, “I came especially to divide this house with my brother—I desire only the eastern garden.” After waiting three days for his brother’s return without success, he suddenly passed away.\n\nThe next day, his brother returned and, grief-stricken, declared, “My brother studied the Dao for many years; this was his way of severing all expectations through transformation.” He then had the coffin interred in the eastern garden.\n\nThe following year, a report from Dongchuan arrived: a Daoist named Ma Ziran of Zitong County had ascended to heaven in broad daylight. When Hangzhou officials opened his coffin, they found only a bamboo staff.\n\n---\n\n**Zhang Ziyang**\n\nZhang Xiangduan, a native of Tiantai, was studious from youth. In his later years, he transmitted the teachings of the Primordial Dao but found them incomplete, so he diligently sought instruction, traveling far and wide.\n\nIn the second year of the Xining reign of the Song (1069), while traveling in Shu, he encountered Liu Haichan, who bestowed upon him the secrets of the Golden Elixir, the Reverted Cinnabar, and the firing times. He then changed his name to Yongcheng, styled himself Pingshu, and took the sobriquet Ziyang.\n\nOnce, there was a monk who cultivated the precepts, concentration, and wisdom, capable of entering samadhi and projecting his spirit. He could traverse hundreds of miles in an instant, and his aspirations aligned closely with Ziyang’s. One day, Ziyang asked, “Master, would you be willing to journey afar today?”\n\nThe monk replied, “I would gladly accompany you to Yangzhou to see the jade-flower.”\n\nZiyang and the monk then sat in a quiet chamber, facing each other with closed eyes in meditation, projecting their spirits. When Ziyang arrived, the monk had already circled the flower three times. Ziyang said, “Pluck one as a keepsake.” Moments later, they stretched and awoke.\n\nZiyang asked, “Master, where is the jade-flower?”\n\nThe monk’s hands were empty. Ziyang then produced the jade-flower and placed it in the monk’s palm.\n\nHis disciples later asked, “You both traveled in spirit—why was there a difference between presence and absence?”\n\nZiyang replied, “My path of the Golden Elixir unites cultivation of both nature and life. Thus, when gathered, it takes form; when dispersed, it becomes qi. Wherever it goes, the true spirit manifests visibly—this is called the yang spirit. His cultivation, however, sought quick results, neglecting the refinement of life and focusing solely on the nature principle. Thus, where he goes, no form or shadow remains—this is called the yin spirit. The yin spirit cannot move objects.”\n\nDuring the Zhiping reign of Emperor Yingzong, he visited Ma Mo of Fufeng, styled Chuhou, in Hedong. He presented his work, *The Awakening to Reality*, saying, “All I have learned in my life is contained herein. I hope you will circulate this book—there may be those who grasp its meaning through reading.”\n\nIn the summer of the fifth year of the Yuanfeng reign (1082), he sat in meditation and passed away, having lived ninety-nine years. When his disciples cremated his body, they recovered hundreds of relics, the largest like lotus seeds, all shimmering in golden-green hues. Those who recognized them said, “This is what the Daoist texts call *relics radiant as golden jade*.”\n\nSeven years later, Liu Fengzhen encountered Ziyang on Mount Wangwu. He left behind a poem and departed.\n\n---\n\n**Li Bití**\n\nDuring the early Shaosheng reign of the Song, Liu Yanzhong resided in Xiuzhou. A Daoist once visited his door, and when someone asked for medicine, the Daoist would mix his nasal mucus with grime to form pills, which instantly cured illnesses. Thus, he styled himself Li Bití.\n\nYanzhong invited him to sit and said, “Today, I have no wine to offer as courtesy.”\n\nThe Daoist laughed and replied, “There is a jug of *Pearl Spring* beneath your bed—why not bring it out to entertain your guest?”\n\nLiu was greatly ashamed and called for a servant to fetch the jug. The Daoist said, “No need to fetch it—just bring the empty jug.” When the jug arrived, he asked for paper to cover it. After a moment, fragrance spilled outward, and it had become fine wine. All who sat there became drunk.\n\nThe next day, Liu had other guests and brought out what he had called *Pearl Spring*, but the jug held not a single drop. One day, the Daoist visited Liu to take his leave, saying, “Twenty years from now, on such-and-such a month and day, we shall meet again in Zhenzhou.” When the appointed time came, Liu died in Zhenzhou.\n\n**Guīyuánzǐ**\nErzhu Dong, styled Weitong, encountered an extraordinary person in his youth who transmitted to him the Dao of returning to the origin and embracing the One. Thus, he styled himself Guīyuánzǐ. Initially, he lived in seclusion on Mount Peng, later selling medicines in the Shu and Han regions, moving as swiftly as if he were flying. Innkeepers would often hear strange sounds in his room at night. Peering in, they saw his body rise from the bed and stop only when it touched the roof beam.\n\nOnce, someone found an object like a sparrow’s egg among dry bones. When they showed it to Dong, he said, “This person consumed divine elixir but failed to cultivate and refine it. Thus, pure yin consumed him entirely, leaving no yang to sustain life. Only the elixir in his cinnabar field congealed into this.”\n\nAt the end of the Tang, when Wang Jian besieged Chengdu, Dong was also in the city. The siege dragged on, and Wang vowed that on the day the city fell, he would slaughter all without exception. Dong then spread out a mat and performed a ritual. He summoned Wang and his entire army, and they were all seized by divine beings riding black clouds, who rebuked Wang, saying, “Dare you bring calamity upon my people? The calamity shall rebound upon you.” Terrified, Wang and his men prostrated themselves. Later, when they entered Chengdu, Wang ordered his troops not to kill, and the people went about their business as usual.\n\nDong sold his elixirs, each pill demanding twelve thousand coins. Once, a certain prefect wished to buy one. Dong said, “The prefect has much gold—it will cost one hundred and twenty thousand.” The prefect, deeming his words deceptive and seditious, ordered him placed in a bamboo cage and sunk into the river.\n\nAt Fuling, upstream, two fishermen were casting their nets when they hauled up the cage—inside was Dong. The fishermen said, “This must be an extraordinary person in meditation.” They struck a bronze bowl to rouse him. After a moment, Dong opened his eyes and asked, “How far is it from here to Tongliang? Is there a place called Sandu?” The fishermen replied, “We are from Baishi River. Tongliang is four hundred *li* from here, and to the east lies Fengdu County, where the immortal’s abode of Pingdu Mountain and Xiandu Temple stands.” Dong said, “My master told me that when I encountered Sandu and Baishi floating on water, I would ascend as an immortal—this must be the place.”\n\nAfter stepping ashore, Dong said to the two fishermen, “I see that you both seem to be men of the Dao. Have you received any transmission?” The two replied, “We once followed an immortal from the sea and received the essence of the Three Ones. We have cultivated yang and refined yin for many years.” Dong then asked for wine, and they drank deeply. He took out his elixir and shared it with them. In a lychee grove, the three of them ascended on clouds and departed.\n\n**Bái Yùchán**\nGe Changgeng, a native of Qiong in the Song, was named Báiyùchán by his mother in fulfillment of a dream. At twenty-two, he sat for the child examination. Later, he lived in seclusion on Mount Wuyi, styling himself Shūqióngzǐ, and studied under Chen Cuixu. After nine years, he finally attained the Dao. With disheveled hair and bare feet, one sleeve always tattered, he was fond of wine but was never seen drunk.\n\nProfoundly versed in Confucian classics, his words flowed as effortless compositions. He once composed a self-eulogy:\n\n*\"Through the ages, disheveled hair and bare feet,\nA lifetime of absorbing qi and dining on rosy clouds.\nLaughing, I point to the foothills of Mount Wuyi—\nDeep within the white clouds lies my home.\"*\n\nHe constantly wore a thunder talisman at his elbow, and his prayers for blessings or exorcisms always met with extraordinary responses. His prognostications of fortune and misfortune startled and awakened the common folk. Once, while traveling in the capital and boating on the West Lake at dusk, he fell into the water. The boatman searched in alarm but found no trace, yet by dawn, Bái Yùchán was still afloat on the water, seemingly intoxicated. Another time, a man wielding a knife pursued and threatened him. Yùchán rebuked the assailant, and the knife clattered to the ground as the man fled. Yùchán called out to him, *\"Come back, do not fear,\"* and returned the knife. People marveled that he emerged from water unstained and remained unharmed by weapons.\n\nDuring the Jiading era of the Song, an imperial decree summoned him to court. His audience with the emperor was deemed satisfactory, and he was appointed to reside at the Taiyi Palace. One day, he vanished without a trace. Thereafter, he roamed famous mountains, his divine wonders beyond comprehension.\n\n**Chén Níwán**\nChén Nán, styled Nánmù and known as Cuìxū, was a native of Boluo. He made a living by weaving bamboo utensils before receiving the *Taiyi Daogui* alchemical method from the Venerable Master of Piling. He obtained the *Jingxiao Dalei Langshu* from a divine being on Mount Limu. Skilled in healing illnesses by kneading earth into talismans, people called him *Chén Níwán* (\"Chen of the Mud Pill\").\n\nOften barefoot and traveling four or five hundred *li* a day, his tattered garments were patched like a quail’s plumage, his body caked in dust and grime. He relished meat and drank to intoxication all day. Once, in Cangwu, he was summoned to pray for rain during a drought. Cuìxū brandished an iron whip and descended into a deep pool to drive out the dragon. In an instant, thunder and rain erupted. Passing through Sanshan, he encountered a raging torrent at Dayi Crossing where no boats dared to sail. Cuìxū floated across on his bamboo hat. While traveling on the Qin Pass road, bandits ambushed and stabbed him. He lay unconscious for three days before the bandits dispersed, and he revived. In Changsha, he was seized by Marshal Chong and sent to prison in Yongzhou, yet within a few nights, he reappeared in Changsha.\n\nAt midnight, he would sit and hold mercury in his mouth, which by the next day transformed into silver. He transmitted his alchemical methods to Bái Yùchán. During the Jiading era of Emperor Ningzong, he entered the waters of Zhangzhou and departed.\n\n**Mò Yuèdǐng**\nMò Yuèdǐng, whose personal name was Dòngyī and courtesy name Qǐyán, was a native of Huzhou. Born with an elegant bearing, his skin was as fair as jade and snow, and his eyes shone with a piercing light. He entered the Zhangren Temple on Mount Qingcheng, where he met Xú Wújí and received the *Five Thunder* method. Thereafter, Yuèdǐng styled himself *Master of Thunder*, commanding spirits and demons, his actions in harmony with the heavens. Whether laughing, jesting, or raging, it seemed as though divine beings followed him.\n\nEmperor Shizu of the Yuan summoned him for an audience. The sky was clear and bright when the emperor asked, *\"Can you summon thunder?\"* Yuèdǐng replied, *\"I can.\"* He took a walnut and cast it to the ground. Thunder roared in response, and the emperor’s expression changed. When ordered to summon rain, it arrived at once. The emperor was overjoyed and bestowed gold and silk upon him. Yuèdǐng tore them to pieces and distributed them to the poor.\n\nHe loved wine and was never without it. When drunk, he would roll his eyes toward the sky, and a chill wind would suddenly rise from his sleeves. Once, while drinking with guests on a boat on the West Lake under a scorching sun, a guest asked for a wisp of cloud to shade them. Yuèdǐng laughed, picked up a fruit rind, and floated it on his wine cup. A cloud arose from the lakeside and cast its shadow over the sun.\n\nAt Fanli Temple, during a Mid-Autumn gathering, clouds obscured the moon for a long time. Yuèdǐng happened to be at the temple, and the Daoists, knowing his powers, hastily invited him to join the feast. With a gesture of his hand, the clouds dispersed as if washed away. A pastry vendor’s basket of cakes was repeatedly stolen by a spirit. Yuèdǐng summoned thunder to strike the clouds, and the severed head of the fox spirit fell in the marketplace.\n\nA man’s bride was abducted en route by a white fox spirit, leaving only an empty carriage at the door. Yuèdǐng performed the *Yubu* step as if directing something. A sudden gale arose, and the woman was blown back to her home. She exclaimed, *\"I was just on North High Peak—how did I end up here?\"*\n\nAt seventy-three, he told his disciple Wáng Jìhuá, *\"Next year, on the thirteenth day of the first month, I will depart at your home.\"* When the day arrived, wind, thunder, rain, and lightning raged. He asked for a brush and wrote a farewell poem. Upon finishing, he passed away peacefully, his face glowing like cinnabar.\n\n**Mǎ Dānyáng**\nMǎ Dānyáng, a native of Ninghai, was the husband of the immortal Sun Xiangu and styled himself *Dānyángzǐ*. When his mother was pregnant, she dreamed of Mágū bestowing a cinnabar pill upon her, which she swallowed. She awoke to a wondrous sensation, and the year was the fifth of the Tianhui era under Emperor Taizong of Jin.\n\nAs a child, he often recited poems about riding clouds and cranes. Lǐ Wúmèng saw him and marveled, *\"Your forehead bears the mark of three mountains, and your hands hang past your knees—truly the material of a great immortal.\"* Sun Jun gave his daughter to him in marriage, and they had three sons. He once wrote a poem:\n\n*\"Embracing the One and guarding unity—this is the work,\nThe lazy man of today is one with the void.\nAll day, I hold my cup to roam my spirit,\nDrunk, yet there is someone to support me.\"*\n\nNo one understood its meaning. One day, Master Wang Chongyang of Zhongnan came to visit, saying, *\"We have a predestined bond from past lives.\"* After eating a melon, he began from the stem. Dānyáng asked why, and he replied, *\"Sweetness comes from bitterness.\"* When asked where he came from, Chongyang said, *\"I have traveled a thousand *li* just to support a drunkard.\"* Dānyáng pondered this and found it aligned with his earlier poem. Astonished, he became his disciple.\n\nChongyang wished to travel west, but Dānyáng could not immediately abandon his family and business. Chongyang admonished him in many ways, and Dānyáng’s resolve finally wavered. He entrusted his wealth to his three sons and followed Chongyang to reside in the misty caves of Kunlun. Sun Xiangu remained at home, establishing a hermitage where she cultivated the Dao for over twenty years.\n\nOne day, Dānyáng told his disciples, *\"Today, there will be an unexpected joy.\"* He sang and danced in delight. Suddenly, celestial music filled the air, and looking up, he saw Xiangu riding a cloud, accompanied by immortal youths, jade maidens, banners, and regalia. She leaned down and said to Dānyáng, *\"I will return first to Penglai Island to await you.\"*\n\nThat night, as they sat in conversation, near the second watch, a great storm of wind and thunder with torrential rain erupted. Dānyáng then bound his hair, pillowed his head upon his arm, and passed away. That same night, he knocked at the wine steward Guò Fùzhōng’s gate, borrowed a brush, and wrote this ode:\n\n*At sixty-one, his years were spent,\nUnknown to all in this world’s rent.\nA thunderous roar—one mighty cry—\nAnd vast, he rides the winds on high.*\n\nThen he said to those around him, *\"The Master has already departed.\"* Only then did they realize that what they had seen were manifestations of his yang spirit.\n\n---\n\n**Zhāng Sānfēng**\nZhāng Sānfēng, a native of Yìzhōu in Liáodōng, was named Jūbǎo and styled Xuánxuán. From birth, he emitted a rare fragrance, with the form of a tortoise and the bones of a crane. He stood seven feet tall, his beard and whiskers bristling like halberds, his topknot bound in a single coil. He carried a blade and a ruler, wore a single straw hat and a single sleeve, enduring both cold and heat without adornment. People called him *\"Zhang the Unkempt.\"* He could travel a thousand *li* in a day, and when still, he would close his eyes in meditation. Though he might consume a *dǒu* or *shēng* of food in ten days, he could also fast for months without discomfort.\n\nAt the end of the Yuán dynasty, he resided at Jīntái Temple in Bǎojī, where he left behind an ode before departing the world. The monk Yáng Zhǎnshān prepared his coffin and sealed it, but when they opened it to confirm, he had revived. He then journeyed into Shǔ. In the early Hóngwǔ era, he arrived at Tàihé Mountain to cultivate the Dao, building a hermitage near Yùxū Palace. Before the hermitage stood five ancient trees, beneath which he often rested.\n\nOver time, fierce beasts would not flee from him, nor would birds of prey swoop upon him—people grew ever more astonished by him. Later, he entered Wǔdāng. There, he told the locals: *\"This mountain shall one day achieve great prominence.\"* After residing there for twenty-three years, he brushed off his sleeves, departed in spirit, and wandered afar. *The Scripture of Carefree Roaming in the Ruins*, Second Scroll—End.",

      "translated_text": "**The Scripture of Xiaoyao Wilderness**\n\n**Title:** *The Scripture of Xiaoyao Wilderness*\n**Author:** Hong Zicheng of the Ming Dynasty\n**Format:** Two fascicles\n**Source Text:** *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*\n\n**Fascicle One of The Scripture of Xiaoyao Wilderness**\n\nWhen mortals are ensnared in the world’s net, the scramble of flies and the pursuit of ants are beneath mention. Even those of old praised for lofty aspirations and noble conduct often find their wings forged and feet shackled, like steeds in harness or crows in cages.\n\nYet who can shed their husk like the cicada and soar like the phoenix, drifting free beyond the dust of things? Only the feathered transcendents and immortal assemblies come to mind—they who sip cloud blossoms, feast on stone marrow, ride purple phoenixes in flight across a thousand leagues, and roam at will astride azure oxen. A single flowering staff carries them across the three thousand worlds of mist and waves; half a tattered robe leads them to the twelve grotto-heavens. This is surely what Master Zhuang meant by *xiaoyao*—carefree wandering.\n\nBy nature, I am ill-suited to worldly company, having long since withdrawn from all earthly vapors. Only purple mushrooms and white stones hold an old fascination for me.\n\nI, Hong Zicheng, am a disciple of Xindu. One day, I was presented with a scroll of immortal records and asked to compose a preface. Upon perusing it, I found azure mists and violet vapors swirling about me, as though I had journeyed to the sea to bow before the Perfected of the Dry Land. The effect was intoxicating—one felt as if already ascending to the cinnabar mounds of the desire realm, the dusty world transformed into a fairy isle of Penglai. Yet even for those with immortal roots or a predestined bond with the Dao, to grasp the skin while forgetting the marrow is no true path to transcendence.\n\nAmid the dust and toil of kalpas past, one may pause to catch one’s breath, wipe the eyes, burn incense of nameless fragrance, and sip bitter tea—such moments of quiet contemplation are like swallowing fire only to quench it with ice. If one day I escape this cage and wander the azure void, I shall take this text as my jade pestle, and perhaps it will not be said that I act without cause.\n\n**Contents of The Scripture of Xiaoyao Wilderness**\n**Lineages of the Immortals**",

      "translated_text": "Laozi is the Most High Lord Lao (Taishang Laojun), who has manifested through successive kalpas without ever having a beginning in birth. By the time of King Yang Jia of the Shang, he divided his spirit and transformed his qi, first dwelling in the womb of the Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden for eighty-one years. In the gengchen year of King Wu Ding’s reign, on the fifteenth day of the second month at the hour of mao, he descended and was born in Ku County of Chu, in Qu Ren Village of Lai Township, emerging from his mother’s left armpit beneath a plum tree. Pointing to the tree, he said, “This shall be my surname.” At birth, his hair was white and his face yellow, with long ears and square eyes. His nose had twin pillars of pure bone, and his ears had three openings. His fine beard spread across his broad cheeks, his teeth were sparse and his mouth square. His feet bore the marks of the Three and Five, and his hands grasped the Ten Patterns. His surname was Li, his given name Er, his courtesy name Boyang, and he was styled Laozi. He was also called Lao Dan.\n\nWhen King Wen of Zhou was the Western Earl, he summoned Laozi to serve as Archivist. During the reign of King Wu, he was promoted to Grand Historian. He then traveled to the Western Limits, Da Qin, and Jambudvipa, where he was known as the Ancient Master, transforming and guiding those lands. During the reign of King Kang, he returned to Zhou and again served as Grand Historian. In the twenty-third year of King Zhao’s reign, he rode a blue ox-drawn carriage through Hangu Pass. The Pass Prefect Yin Xi, recognizing him, sought and obtained the Dao. In the twenty-fifth year, he descended at the Green Sheep Market in Shu and, together with Yin Xi, crossed the Flowing Sands into the Hu territories. By the time of King Mu, he had returned to the Central Lands. In the seventeenth year of King Jing’s reign, Confucius inquired of the Dao from Lao Dan and, upon retiring, sighed that he was like a dragon. In the ninth year of King Nan’s reign, he again emerged from the Sanyuan Pass and ascended to Kunlun in flight.\n\nDuring the Qin, he descended by the banks of the Jia River, where he was known as the Riverbank Elder, transmitting the Dao to An Qisheng. In the time of Emperor Wen of Han, he was called Master Guangcheng. The emperor dispatched envoys to summon him, but the Master said, “The Dao is revered and virtue is noble; they cannot be inquired of from afar.” The emperor then personally journeyed to him. The emperor said, “Within the realm, there are Four Greats, and the king occupies one. Though you possess the Dao, you are still my subject. Why not submit? What is so lofty? I can make the poor rich and the lowly noble.” The Master then rose from his village seat, floating gently into the empty air like a cloud ascending. He stopped in the mysterious void more than a hundred yards above the ground. After a long while, he replied with joy, “Above, you do not reach Heaven; in the middle, you are unlike men; below, you do not dwell on Earth. What subjects do you have? How can Your Majesty make them rich or poor, noble or base?” The emperor awakened and descended from his carriage to bow in apology. The Master then bestowed upon him the two scriptures of the *Dao* and *Virtue*.\n\nIn truth, there is no age in which he does not appear. He enacts transformation before the kalpas of dust and abides eternally beyond the ultimate end. His concealment and manifestation are unfathomable, his transformations boundless. Universally delivering gods and humans, his deeds cannot be fully recounted.\n\n**Eastern King Father (Dongwang Gong)**\nThe Eastern King Father, whose personal name was Ni and courtesy name Junming, was born through primordial transformation on the Azure Sea’s expanse, in the Wastes of Cangling, before the world had people or things. His Dao-nature was serene and still, his embodied form perfectly non-active. He assisted in the mysterious work, nurturing and transforming the myriad beings. Master of the yang and harmonious qi, he governed the East and was also called the Eastern King Father. All those in Heaven and Earth—men who ascend as immortals and attain the Dao—are under his charge.\n\nOn a dingmao day, he ascended a terrace to observe the immortals ascending to Heaven through kalpic transformation, which numbered nine ranks. Yet when first ascending, they first bow to the Grand Duke, then pay respects to the Metal Mother. Only after completing these rites may they ascend the Nine Heavens and enter the Three Purities, where they pay homage to the Most High and behold the Primordial Beginning.\n\nIn the early Han, a group of children chanted a playful rhyme by the road: *“Don a blue skirt, ascend Heaven’s gate, bow to the Metal Mother, salute the Wood Father.”* No one at the time understood its meaning, but Zhang Liang went to pay his respects. He later told others, “This is the Jade Lad of the Eastern King Father.”\n\n**Western Queen Mother (Xiwang Mu)**\nThe Western Queen Mother is also known as the Golden Mother of Tortoise Terrace. She received the supremely wondrous qi of the Western Florescence and was transformed into being in Yi River, with the surname Wei, personal name Hui, and courtesy name Wanling. She holds sway in the West, jointly governing the two qi with the Eastern King Father, harmonizing Heaven and Earth, and shaping the myriad beings. All those in Heaven and Earth—women who ascend as immortals—are under her jurisdiction.\n\nShe resides in the Gardens of Kunlun, the Enclosure of the Wind’s Fragrance. Her nine-tiered jade towers and mysterious terraces are flanked on the left by the Jasper Pool and encircled on the right by the Emerald Waters. Her Five-Flowered Grove of women includes beauties like the Orchid Maidens and Jade Goblet Fairies.\n\nWhen King Mu of Zhou made his western tour with his Eight Steeds, he presented a white jade tablet and a dark jade disk to pay his respects to the Queen Mother, who then feasted him upon the Jasper Pool. The Mother sang for the king: *“White clouds drift in the sky, mountain forests arise of themselves. The road is long and distant, the mountains and rivers inquire of it. If you, my lord, do not die, you may yet seek it again.”*",

      "translated_text": "In the first year of the *Yuanfeng* era of the Later Han, she descended upon the palace of Emperor Wu, presenting him with seven peaches of immortality. The emperor wished to keep their pits, but the Queen Mother said, “These peaches do not grow in the mortal world—they bear fruit but once every three thousand years.” At that moment, Dongfang Shuo was seen peering through the window. The Mother pointed and said, “This boy has already stolen my peaches twice.”\n\nThat day, she commanded her attendant Dong Shuangcheng to play the *Cloud Harmony* flute, Wang Zideng to pluck the *Eight Jade* zither, Xu Feiqiong to sound the *Spirit Void* reed organ, and An Faxing to sing the *Mystic Spirit* hymn, offering blessings to Emperor Wu.\n\n**Chisongzi**\nChisongzi, the Rain Master of the Shennong era, refined his spirit and ingested *qi*, able to enter water without wetting and fire without burning. He journeyed to Kunlun Mountain and often dwelled in the Queen Mother’s stone chamber, ascending and descending with the winds and rains. The Flame Emperor’s youngest daughter pursued him and, attaining immortality, departed with him. In the time of Gao Xin, he served as Rain Master, wandering among mortals.\n\n**Guangchengzi**\nGuangchengzi, a man of the Xuanyuan era, secluded himself in a stone chamber on Kongtong Mountain. The Yellow Emperor visited him, inquiring about the essence of the supreme Dao. He replied: “The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; its ultimate truth, dark and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness—then the body will right itself. Be still, be pure; do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence, do not let your thoughts churn restlessly, and you may attain long life. Guard within, seal without; excess wisdom leads to ruin. I preserve the One and dwell in harmony—thus have I lived one thousand two hundred years without aging.”\n\n**Qingwu Gong**\nQingwu Gong, a disciple of Peng Zu, received instruction from an enlightened master and mastered the wondrous principles of true immortality. He entered the mountains of Huayin to cultivate the Dao, accumulating four hundred seventy-one years. Later, he ingested golden elixir and ascended to heaven.\n\n**Peng Zu**\nPeng Zu, Qian Keng by name, was a great-great-grandson of Emperor Zhuanxu. By the end of the Yin dynasty, he had lived over seven hundred years yet showed no signs of aging. Fond of tranquility, he excelled in the arts of nourishing life, consuming mica, quartz, and deer antler, ever retaining a youthful countenance. When King Mu heard of him, he appointed Peng Zu as a grandee, but Peng Zu claimed illness and took no part in governance. The Royal Concubine rode in a curtained carriage to seek his teachings. He imparted all essential methods, which she then taught the king. The king tested them and found them effective. Peng Zu, sensing this, departed, and his whereabouts became unknown. Seventy years later, his disciples saw him west of the Flowing Sands.\n\n**Iron-Crutch Master**\nThe Iron-Crutch Master, surnamed Li, was by nature robust. In his early years, he heard the Dao and cultivated truth in mountain caves. At times, Lord Lao and Master Wanqiu descended to his mountain retreat to instruct him in the teachings of the Dao. One day, the Master was to meet Lord Lao on Mount Hua. He instructed his disciple: “My *po* remains here; if my wandering soul does not return within seven days, you may then dissolve my *po*.” The disciple, rushing home due to his mother’s sudden illness, dissolved it on the sixth day. The Master returned on the seventh day but, finding his *po* gone, attached himself to the corpse of a starved beggar. Thus, his form became lame and unsightly, no longer his original self.\n\n**Wang Ziqiao**\nWang Ziqiao, Crown Prince Jin of King Ling of Zhou, loved to play the *sheng*, mimicking the cry of the phoenix. While wandering between the Yi and Luo rivers, the Daoist Master Fuqiu Gong carried him to the summit of Mount Songgao. Over thirty years later, Ziqiao appeared to Xiang Liang and said, “Tell my family to await me on the seventh day of the seventh month at the summit of Mount Hou.” On the appointed day, he indeed arrived riding a white crane, alighting upon the mountain’s peak—visible but unreachable. He bowed to the people below, lingering for several days before departing. Later, a shrine was erected for him at the foot of Mount Weishi.\n\n**Yin Xi**\nYin Xi, styled Gongwen, was a native of Tianshui.",

      "translated_text": "At first, his mother once napped in the daytime and dreamed of the crimson clouds of heaven swirling around her body. When Xi was born, lotus flowers spontaneously bloomed upon the earth. As he grew, his eyes held the essence of the sun, his bearing tall and refined, his arms hanging past his knees—his majesty was that of a celestial being. From youth, he devoted himself to the study of the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, the *Book of Changes*, and the cultivation of virtue and benevolence, spurning worldly rites. He humbled himself to aid others, seeking neither fame nor advancement.\n\nDuring the reign of King Kang of Zhou, he served as a grandee. Gazing at the celestial patterns, he saw a purple qi advancing westward from the east and knew a sage would soon cross the pass. He thus requested to be appointed magistrate of Hangu Pass. He instructed the gatekeeper Sun Jing in advance: “Should any appear with an extraordinary bearing or unusual carriage, do not permit them to pass.”\n\nIn the twenty-third year of King Zhao’s reign, the seventh month, the Old Master indeed arrived, riding a white carriage drawn by a black ox, intending to cross the pass. The gatekeeper entered to report to Xi, who said, “Today I shall behold the sage!” He immediately donned his court robes, went forth to meet him, and prostrated himself in invitation, saying, “I beseech you to tarry awhile, divine carriage.”\n\nThe Old Master declined, “I am but a poor, lowly old man dwelling east of the pass, my fields lying west of it. I merely journey to gather firewood—why detain me?”\n\nXi again bowed deeply, “Long have I known the great sage would come traveling west. You have endured exposure for days—pray rest your divine carriage awhile.”\n\nThe Old Master replied, “I have heard that in the lands of Jambudvīpa, there is an ancient master. Thus I follow the Way, passing through your pass—why should I linger?”\n\nXi said, “Beholding your sacred countenance, transcendent and peerless, you are surely the supreme one of heaven. What need have you to visit the frontier barbarians?”\n\nThe Old Master asked, “How do you know this?”\n\nXi answered, “Last winter’s tenth month, the star of heavenly principle moved westward past the Pleiades. Since the first of this month, the melting winds have come thrice. The true qi of the east, shaped like a dragon-serpent, has transformed and advanced west—this is the sign of a great sage.”\n\nThe Old Master then smiled and said, “Well indeed! You know me, just as I have long known you.”\n\nXi bowed again and asked, “May I inquire as to the great sage’s name?”\n\nThe Old Master replied, “My name and style are vast, spanning kalpas beyond recounting. Now I am surnamed Li, styled Boyang, and called the Old Master.”\n\nThereupon, Xi prepared a seat in the official residence and made offerings, performing the rites of a disciple. The Old Master remained at the pass for over a hundred days, transmitting to Xi all methods of inner and outer cultivation.\n\nAt that time, the Old Master’s charioteer, Xu Jia, had long been in his service, contracted to receive a hundred coins daily. By the time they reached the pass, the debt had grown to seventy-three million coins. Seeing the Old Master depart for distant lands, Xu Jia hastened to demand payment. The Old Master said, “When I return from the western seas, I shall repay you tenfold in gold.”\n\nXu Jia, holding him to his word, followed to the place where the black ox grazed. The Old Master, wishing to test him, transformed an auspicious herb into a beautiful woman who walked to where the ox was pastured. With words, she beguiled Xu Jia, who, entranced, forgot his prior agreement. He then went to the magistrate and sued the Old Master for his wages.\n\nThe Old Master said to Xu Jia, “You have followed me for over two hundred years. Long ago, you should have died, but I gave you the *Tai Xuan Sheng Fu* to preserve your life until today. How can you forget this and sue me?”\n\nAs he spoke, the talisman flew from Xu Jia’s mouth, and his body instantly turned to white bones.",

The Old Master once more cast the *Tai Xuan Sheng Fu* upon him, and Xu Jia instantly revived. Xu Jia then repaid him with the owed silver and respectfully sent him on his way.\n\nOne day, the Old Master said to Yin Xi, “The ancient master was none other than my own form. Once, I transformed myself in Jambudvīpa, and now I shall return my spirit to the Nameless. I depart today.” Yin Xi kowtowed, entreating to accompany him. The Old Master replied, “I wander beyond heaven and earth, frolic within the mysteries of the unseen. The four directions, eight poles—above and below, boundless. How could you follow me?” Yin Xi said, “I would enter fire, plunge into the abyss, reduce my body to ashes, and forfeit my life—all to follow the Great Immortal.” The Old Master said, “Though your bones bear the marks of the Dao, you have received the Way for but a short time. How could you transform the kingdoms?”\n\nThereupon, he bestowed upon him the *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Its Virtue* and set a time: “After a thousand days, seek me at the market of the green ram.” With these words, he sat upon a cloud of radiant blossoms and slowly ascended into the sky. His light illuminated the dwelling, five-colored and profound, lingering long before vanishing. Yin Xi, his gaze fixed upon the clouds, wept in longing and named the account *The Scripture of Western Ascension*.\n\nYin Xi then withdrew from worldly affairs, composing nine scrolls himself, which he titled *The Master of Guān*. In the year *ding-si*, he journeyed west to seek the market of the green ram. The Old Master had ascended to heaven in the year *jia-yin*; by the year *yi-mao*, he had once more divided his body from the Palace of Great Tenuity and descended into the kingdom of Shu, born into the household of the Li family, officials of the court. Earlier, he had saved a green dragon, transforming it into a ram, its color like blue-green gold, which remained by the side of the newborn child, beloved and endlessly played with. Suddenly, one day, the ram vanished. The boy searched for it and found it in the marketplace.\n\nWhen Yin Xi arrived in Shu, he asked the locals in vain for the market of the green ram. Then, he suddenly saw a boy leading a ram and inquired, “Whose ram is this? Where are you taking it?” The boy replied, “My lady gave birth to a son, and he loves to play with this ram. It went missing two days ago, and the child has not stopped crying. Now that I’ve found it, I’m taking it home.” Yin Xi then instructed him, “Please tell the lady’s son that Yin Xi has arrived.” The boy went inside to relay the message, and the child immediately rose, straightening his clothes, and said, “Bring Yin Xi in.”\n\nAs Yin Xi entered the household, the halls and courtyards suddenly grew vast, and lotus thrones emerged from the ground. The child transformed into a body of white gold, several *zhang* tall, radiant as the sun, a halo encircling his neck, seated upon the lotus throne. The entire household was struck with awe. The child said, “I am the Old Master.”",

Host and guest depend upon one another—what is there to marvel at?\n\nYin Xi, filled with boundless reverence, bowed deeply and said, “I never expected to behold the celestial countenance again.”\n\nThe Old Master replied, “I once detained you because, having newly received the scriptural instructions, you had not yet perfected your attainment. Thus did I await you here. Now you have preserved your form and refined your appearance, reaching the realm of true subtlety. Your heart is bound with the purple net, and your face radiates divine light. Your golden name is inscribed in the Dark Garden, and your jade tally resounds in the Purple Chamber.”\n\nHe then commanded the Five Elder Thearchs and the Four Poles’ Veritable Inspectors to confer upon Yin Xi a jade register and golden writ, bestowing the title *Master of the Literary Beginning*. His rank was elevated to that of the Supreme Perfected, above the Twenty-Four Heavenly Kings, and he was entrusted with the governance of eighty thousand immortals.

He dwelt on Five Dragons Ridge in Yunyang, living through the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties. Though he reached eight hundred years of age, his movements spanned eight hundred *li*, and the people of his time thus called him Li Babai. At times he concealed himself in mountain forests, at others he dwelt amid the dust of the marketplace. He also cultivated and refined himself in a stone chamber on Mount Hualin, and upon completing his elixir, returned to Shu. During the reign of King Mu of Zhou, he resided on Mount Jintang, where the people of Shu saw him through the ages, calling him the Perfected Lord of Purple Yang.\n\n**Ding Lingwei**\nDing Lingwei was originally a man of Liaodong. He studied the Dao on Mount Lingxu, later transforming into a crane to return home. Alighting upon a decorated pillar, he sang:\n*“There is a bird, a bird—Ding Lingwei,*\n*Who left his home a thousand years ago and has not yet returned.*\n*The city walls remain as before, but the people are no more.*\n*Why not study immortality? The tombs now bristle with weeds.”*\n\n**Guiguzi**\nGuiguzi was a man of the Spring and Autumn period. His surname was Wang, his given name, Ling. Once he entered Mount Yunmeng to gather herbs and attained the Dao. His complexion remained that of a youth, and he dwelt in Ghost Valley by the Green Stream. Su Qin and Zhang Yi came to seek his teachings, and after three years, departed. He left them a letter, saying: *“The two of you have achieved resounding fame, yet like spring blossoms that fade by autumn, your glory cannot long endure. Now you both cherish the ephemeral honors of morning dew, neglecting the work of longevity. You scorn the enduring pine and cypress, prizing instead the fleeting titles of a single day. Alas! A woman’s love does not last the night, nor a man’s joy outlast the wheel’s turning.”* Guiguzi lived among people for several hundred years, then vanished without a trace. His works, *The Jade Token* and *The Master of Ghost Valley*, circulate in the world.\n\n**Liu Yue**\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, there was a Master Kuang, named Xu, who cultivated himself on Mount Nanchang. A youth often came to visit him, his words and bearing extraordinary, so the master regarded him with wonder. He asked, *“I have observed your manner for some time. May I inquire as to your homeland and name?”* The youth replied, *“My surname is Liu, my given name Yue. I dwell to the left of this mountain. Below the mountain stands a stone, some two *zhang* in height. Knock upon it, and I shall receive you.”* The master followed his instructions and knocked upon the stone, which suddenly opened of its own accord, revealing a pair of doors swinging wide. A young attendant welcomed the master inside. After several dozen paces, two maidens in crimson robes with vermilion staffs appeared to lead the way. Gradually, pavilions and terraces came into view, their gold and jade hues shimmering in contrast. Rare birds and strange beasts roamed amidst extraordinary plants and trees. A perfected one, crowned with a jade diadem and girded with a vermilion sash and sword, came forth to greet him. The master wished to remain, but the perfected one said, *“Your hidden merits are not yet complete. A future meeting may be expected—there is no hurry to follow me now.”* He offered the master three cups of jade wine and a sip of the Longevity-Preserving Elixir before sending him out. When the master turned to look back, the stone he had knocked upon appeared as it had before.

The Perfected One had a round crown and broad forehead, thick ears and long brows, deep-set eyes and a towering nose, a square mouth and full cheeks, lips and face like cinnabar. His nipples were widely spaced, his arms long—like those of a three-year-old child. He made no sound day or night, yet on the seventh day, he suddenly spoke, saying: *\"My body roams the Purple Palace; my name is inscribed in the Jade Capital.\"*\n\nIn his prime, he served the Han as a general.

      "translated_text": "Ma Chengzi was by nature fond of tranquility and retirement, taking no delight in the bustle of worldly glory. He once sighed to himself, saying: \"Human life is but a fleeting spark—why cling so long to the dusty realm?\" Thereupon, he abandoned his home to seek the Dao, entering a stone chamber on Heming Mountain in Shu, where he cultivated and refined himself for over twenty years. Later, he encountered an extraordinary person who transmitted to him the Divine Elixir, saying: \"Qi is the Internal Elixir; medicinal substances are the External Elixir. Having obtained this and consumed it, you shall be numbered among the immortals.\" With these words, the stranger departed. Chengzi followed the method diligently, and thus ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\n**Huang An**\nHuang An was a native of Daiqun. Though over ten thousand years old, his appearance remained that of a child. He constantly ingested cinnabar, so that his entire body was crimson. He wore no clothing and sat upon a divine tortoise, which measured two feet across. When people asked how long he had sat upon the tortoise, he replied: \"It emerges once every three thousand years—I have already seen it emerge five times since I obtained it.\" When he walked, he carried the tortoise upon his back. Emperor Wu of Han, hearing of his strangeness, discussed with him the matters of emptiness, non-being, and the immortals, always deferring to him in courtesy. When the emperor performed the Feng sacrifice at Mount Tai, he summoned Dong Ye, Li Ke, Meng Qi, Guo Qiong, and Huang An to ride together in the same carriage, calling them his \"immortal ministers.\" After the emperor’s passing, Huang An’s whereabouts became unknown.\n\n**Liu Haichan**\nLiu Xuanying, styled Haichanzi, was a scholar of the classics who served as prime minister to Liu Shouguang, lord of Yan. He was deeply devoted to the study of life and destiny and revered the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. One day, a Daoist suddenly arrived, calling himself Master Zhengyang, and sought an audience. Haichan received him in the hall with the rites due a guest. The Daoist expounded the essentials of the school of purity and non-action, as well as the key methods of the Golden Fluid and the Returned Elixir. When he finished, he requested ten eggs of a parrot and ten gold coins. Placing one coin upon the table, he stacked the ten eggs atop it in the manner of a pagoda. Haichan, astonished, exclaimed: \"How perilous!\" The Daoist replied: \"For one dwelling in the realm of glory and rank, treading the ground of care and calamity, the peril is far greater.\" Then, taking all the coins, he split them and cast them aside before departing. Haichan was profoundly awakened by this and immediately resigned his seal of office, left the court, changed into Daoist robes, and withdrew to the foothills of Mount Zhongnan. After completing his elixir, he underwent liberation by means of the corpse, a white qi issuing from his crown and transforming into a crane that soared into the heavens.\n\n**Fuqiu Bo**\nFuqiu Bo, surnamed Li, lived in reclusion on Mount Song. For twenty years, he consumed yellow essence, causing his hair to return to black and his fallen teeth to regrow. After a long time, his Dao was accomplished, and he ascended in broad daylight. He once composed the *Song of the Origin of the Dao*, which says:\nThe tiger crouches, the dragon too lies hidden;\nThe dragon hides only after the tiger has crouched.\nSimply complete the work of the River Chariot,\nAnd there is no need for defense or resistance.\nAll you disciples who study flying immortality,\nWildly deluded, you cannot abide.\nLeft and right, obtain sovereign and minister,\nThe four substances mutually cherish and protect.\nWhen the model of Heaven and Earth is formed,\nThe Perfected One will naturally attend to you.\n\n**Liu Chen**\nLiu Chen was a native of Kexian.",

After thirteen days, parched and famished, they spied peaches on the mountainside and together picked and ate them. Descending to drink from a mountain stream, they saw a cup floating toward them, within which was sesame rice. The two rejoiced, saying, “There must be people nearby.” Crossing the mountain, they came upon a great ravine where two women of surpassing beauty stood by the stream. Smiling, they called out, “Have Messrs. Liu and Ruan come to fetch the cup?” Liu and Ruan were astonished, yet the women appeared entirely unruffled. “Why have you come so late?” they asked, and invited the men to their home. On the southern and eastern walls hung crimson curtains and vermilion bed-canopies. The women ordered their attendants to prepare a feast: sesame rice, dried mutton, all exquisitely sweet. After the meal, wine was served. Presently, a maidservant presented peaches, laughing, “Congratulations on your new sons-in-law!” As the wine flowed, music and merriment filled the air. At midnight, each couple retired to separate canopies, where the women’s tenderness was beyond compare. After ten days, the men asked to return home, but the women reluctantly kept them for half a year. The climate and vegetation remained ever spring-like, and the songs of a hundred birds filled the air, soothing their longing for home. The women sighed, “Your karmic roots are not yet severed; that is why you have tarried here.” They then showed them the way home.

      "translated_text": "Zhang Daoling was the eighth-generation descendant of Zhang Liang. Standing nine feet and two inches tall, he had bushy brows, a broad forehead, a crimson crown, green eyes, a high nose, a square jaw, and eyes with three distinct angles. A ridge of bone ran from his brow to his crown, and his arms hung past his knees. With the bearing of a crouching dragon and the stride of a prowling tiger, he appeared solemn and imposing from afar.\n\nIn the tenth year of *Jianwu* during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of Han, he was born on Mount Tianmu. His mother initially dreamed of a celestial being descending from the Northern Dipper, who presented her with a fragrant rose. Upon waking, the room was filled with an extraordinary scent that lingered for a month, and she conceived from the dream. On the day of his birth, yellow clouds enveloped the chamber, purple qi filled the courtyard, and the room radiated light like the sun and moon.\n\nAt the age of seven, he mastered the *Dao De Jing* and the esoteric texts of the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*, delving deeply into their mysteries. Though he was recommended as a candidate of *Xianliang Fangzheng* and entered officialdom, his heart remained set on cultivation. He traveled to Shu, drawn to its deep valleys and verdant peaks, and eventually secluded himself on Mount Heming.\n\nAmong his disciples was Wang Chang, who studied astronomy and was well-versed in the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Together, they refined the Great Elixir of Dragon and Tiger. After three years, the elixir was perfected. Though the Perfected One was over sixty, after consuming it, he appeared no older than thirty. He then journeyed with Wang Chang to the northern peaks of Mount Song, where they encountered an emissary in embroidered robes. The emissary informed them, “Within the stone chamber of the central peak lie the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns* and the *Nine-Cauldron Elixir Canon of the Yellow Emperor and Grand Clarity*. Obtain and cultivate these, and you shall ascend to heaven.”\n\nThereupon, the Perfected One fasted and purified himself for seven days before entering the stone chamber. Suddenly, a resonant sound arose, and upon digging, he indeed retrieved the elixir texts. Through diligent refinement, he gained the ability to divide his form and disperse his shadow. Whether rowing a boat on the pond, reciting scriptures in the hall, resting against a desk while receiving guests, or strolling with a flowering staff chanting verses, all these manifestations occurred simultaneously, leaving others unable to fathom his true nature.\n\nIn the region of Fangling between Xicheng, a white tiger spirit delighted in drinking human blood, and the locals sacrificed a person to it each year. The Perfected One summoned the spirit and admonished it, causing it to vanish. In Zizhou, a giant serpent often spewed toxic mist, poisoning travelers who passed by. The Perfected One subdued it with his methods, and it ceased to harm others.\n\nOn the night of the fifteenth day of the first month in the *Renwu* year of Emperor Shun’s reign, the Perfected One awoke from a dream on Mount Heming to the sound of jade pendants tinkling and celestial music faintly echoing. Gazing upward, he saw a white chariot amidst purple clouds, within which sat a divine being whose countenance was like ice and jade, radiating a brilliance too dazzling to behold directly. A figure before the chariot addressed him, saying, “Do not be alarmed—this is the Most High Lord Lao.” The Perfected One bowed in reverence.\n\nLord Lao spoke: “Recently, six great demonic spirits in Shu have wantonly tormented the people, a grievous and lamentable state. You shall act on my behalf to subdue them and bring blessings to the living. Your merit will be boundless, and your name shall be recorded on the Cinnabar Terrace.”",

      "translated_text": "Then he bestowed upon him the *Zhengyi Mengwei Secret Register*, along with the *Three Clarities’ Collected Scriptures* in nine hundred and thirty scrolls. He also gave him talismans, cinnabar writs, and seventy-two volumes of secret formulas; a pair of male and female swords; and the *General Merit Seal*. Furthermore, he said, “Let us meet again at the *Ban Orchard* after a thousand days.” The Perfected One kowtowed and accepted the gifts. Day and night, he studied the secret texts and followed the methods in cultivation.\n\nAt that time, eight demonic marshals, each leading ghostly legions numbering in the tens of millions, roamed the mortal realm, slaughtering countless people and causing untold premature deaths. The Perfected One, bearing the mandate of Lord Lao, donned the *Mengwei Secret Register* and journeyed to Mount Qingcheng, where he set up a high seat of lapis lazuli. To his left, he enshrined the *Great Dao’s Primordial Heavenly Worthy*, and to his right, the *Thirty-Six Divisions of True Scriptures*. He erected ten *Spirit-Barring Banners* around the ritual platform, sounded the bells and struck the chimes, and arrayed the *Dragon and Tiger Divine Soldiers*. The demonic hordes immediately brandished weapons, arrows, and stones to harm the Perfected One. With a single gesture of his hand, he transformed them into a vast lotus flower to repel their assault. The demons then wielded over a thousand torches of fire, but the Perfected One raised his hand once more, and the flames turned back to consume the demons themselves. From afar, they cried out, “Master, you dwell on Mount Emei—why have you come to seize our abode?” The Perfected One replied, “You have wantonly harmed living beings, so I have come to subdue you. You shall be banished to the barren lands of the West by Lord Lao’s command. From now on, flee far away and cease spreading illness among the people. If you disobey, you shall be annihilated without a single survivor.”\n\nThe demon kings refused to submit. The next day, they rallied the six great demon lords and encircled the Perfected One with a million ghostly troops. The Perfected One drew a single stroke with his cinnabar brush, and the entire host perished. Only the six demon kings collapsed to the ground, unable to rise. They kowtowed and begged for their lives. The Perfected One paid them no heed and drew another stroke with his cinnabar brush, splitting the mountain in two. The six demon kings, unable to cross, began wailing piteously, swearing to dwell in the *Śāla Kingdom* of the West. The Perfected One relented, reversing his brushstroke to restore them. He then commanded Wang Chang to place a great stone as a bridge for them to cross. Still seeking to test their resolve, he said, “Let us each demonstrate our powers.” The six demons replied, “As you command.” The Perfected One entered fire and emerged stepping upon a blue lotus. The demon marshals, however, were consumed by the flames. The Perfected One entered water and emerged riding a yellow dragon. The demon marshals drowned in the depths. The Perfected One entered stone and passed through it unscathed. The demon marshals, however, could only penetrate an inch before the Perfected One exhaled a divine talisman, pointing with his left hand to slay them and with his right to revive them. The demons, now unable to distinguish life from death, transformed into eight great tigers and lunged at him. The Perfected One became a lion and gave chase. The demons then turned into eight great dragons, seeking to seize him, but the Perfected One transformed into a *Golden-Winged Peng* and pecked out their eyes. The demons conjured five-colored clouds to darken heaven and earth, but the Perfected One became five radiant suns, their scorching light dispersing the clouds. Exhausting their transformations, the demons were at a loss. The Perfected One then manifested a boulder weighing over ten thousand *jin*, suspending it above their camp with a lotus fiber. He commanded two mice to gnaw at the thread, threatening to crush them. The demons wailed in unison, swearing never again to harm living beings. The Perfected One then banished the six great demon kings to *Northern Deng* and exiled the eight demon marshals to the Western Regions. Some ghosts still lingered, hesitant to depart. The Perfected One intoned a divine talisman, sending it soaring into the heavens. In an instant, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning descended with a host of blades, and the demonic horde vanished without a trace.\n\nThe Perfected One then traveled to *Yuntai Mountain* in *Cangxi County* and said to Wang Chang, “This mountain shall be the site of my ascension.” There, he chose a dwelling to cultivate the *Ninefold Return* and *Sevenfold Reversion* arts. One day, he once again heard the tinkling of jade pendants and celestial music. The Perfected One straightened his robes and prostrated himself, beholding Lord Lao arriving with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, hovering among the clouds without descending. The Perfected One bowed again, and Lord Lao commanded a messenger to declare, “Your merits have earned you the rank of *Ninefold Perfected Upper Immortal*. When I first sent you to Shu, it was merely to distinguish between humans and demons to establish a realm of purity. Yet you have slain too many demons and wantonly summoned wind and rain, commanding spirits and ghosts, darkening the daylight with yin shadows and polluting the skies with killing intent. This is far from the Great Dao’s love of life. The Celestial Emperor has already reproached you for your transgressions, which is why I cannot draw near to you. Retire now and devote yourself to cultivation and repentance. I shall await you in the *Realm of Non-Being*, within the *Eight Radiant Palaces of Highest Clarity*.” With these words, the sacred procession ascended and departed.\n\nThe Perfected One, heeding the decree, relocated with Wang Chang to Mount Heming. He said to his disciple Zhao Sheng, “There are malevolent spirits there—we must go and eliminate them.” Upon arrival, twelve divine maidens greeted them with laughter before the mountain. The Perfected One inquired, “Where is the salt spring in this place?” The maidens replied, “The great spring ahead is the abode of a poisonous dragon.” The Perfected One inscribed a talisman, transforming it into a *Golden-Winged Peng* that circled above the spring. The dragon, startled, abandoned the spring and fled, leaving behind a salt spring. Later, the local people boiled its waters to obtain salt. The twelve maidens each presented a jade bracelet, saying, “We wish to serve you.” The Perfected One accepted the bracelets and, with a twist of his hand, merged the twelve into one. He declared, “I shall cast this bracelet into the well. Whoever retrieves it shall be my destined companion.” The maidens hastily undressed and plunged into the well, competing to seize the jade bracelet. The Perfected One sealed the well with an oath, saying, “Henceforth, you shall be well spirits, never to emerge again.” To this day, the people of that land suffer no harm from the divine maidens and enjoy the benefits of the salt well.\n\nAfter twenty more years of cultivation, the Perfected One once again took Zhao Sheng and Wang Chang to Mount Heming. One day at noon, a figure clad in black silk, girded with a sword and bearing a royal casket, approached and said, “By the command of the *Highest Clarity True Talisman*, the Perfected One is summoned to wander the *Orchid Park*.”",

A figure before the chariot addressed him, saying, “Do not be alarmed—this is the Most High Lord Lao.” The Perfected One bowed in reverence.\n\nLord Lao spoke: “Recently, six great demonic spirits in Shu have wantonly tormented the people, a grievous and lamentable state. You shall act on my behalf to subdue them and bring blessings to the living. Your merit will be boundless, and your name shall be recorded on the Cinnabar Terrace.”",

      "translated_text": "In an instant, a black dragon drew a purple chariot, and two jade maidens ushered the Perfected One aboard. In the blink of an eye, they arrived at the celestial gate, where a host of immortals paid their respects. After some time, two azure lads in crimson robes, bearing vermilion staffs, stepped forward as heralds, announcing, “The Venerable Lord has arrived.” Together, they ascended into the void and reached a palace of gold and jade. Someone addressed the Perfected One, saying, “You are to attend the audience of the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy.”\n\nThe Perfected One straightened his robes and hastened into the hall. After a while, the hall stirred as the azure lads conveyed to him the methods of the *Orthodox Unity Alliance of Might*, charging him to proclaim them through the generations as the Celestial Master, to exhort and guide the unenlightened, and secretly revealed to him the appointed time of his ascension. Having received his mandate, the Perfected One returned to Mount Heming.\n\nOn the seventh day of the first month in the first year of *Yongshou* under Emperor Huan, at the fifth watch of dawn, Chang and Sheng beheld the Venerable Lord descending in a dragon-drawn carriage from the heavens. He commanded the Perfected One to mount a white crane and journey with him to Chengdu, where he expounded once more the principles of the *Orthodox Unity Alliance of Might* and recited the *Scripture of the Northern and Southern Dippers*. When he had finished, the Venerable Lord departed.\n\nWishing to leave a divine trace, the Perfected One stood at the northwestern half-cliff of the Cloud Terrace and leapt bodily into the stone wall, emerging from the summit—thus forming two caves in the mountain. On the ninth day of the ninth month, in the Qu Pavilion Mountain of Chicheng, Baxi, the Celestial Emperor dispatched an emissary bearing a jade tablet to bestow upon the Perfected One the title of *Perfected One of Orthodox Unity* and revealed that the time of his ascension was at hand. The Perfected One then entrusted his eldest son, Heng, with the secret registers of the *Alliance of Might*, the *Capital Merit* and other sacred texts, the demon-slaying double swords, and the jade tablet and seal.\n\nHe addressed Chang and Sheng, saying, “There remains some elixir; you two may divide and consume it. Today, you shall ascend with me.” At noon, a procession of immortals arrived in full regalia, and celestial music accompanied the Way upon Cloud Terrace Peak. In broad daylight, he ascended to heaven. At that time, the Perfected One was one hundred and twenty-three years old.\n\n---\n\n**Xiao Shi**\nXiao Shi had attained the Dao and delighted in playing the flute.

      "translated_text": "**Fei Changfang**\n\nOnce, while tending to market affairs, Fei Changfang saw an old man selling medicine in the marketplace, who hung a gourd at the front of his stall. When the market closed, the old man would leap into the gourd. No one in the market noticed, but Changfang, observing from an upper floor, saw this strange sight. He went forward and bowed twice. The old man said, “Come again tomorrow.” The next day, Changfang returned as promised, and the old man took him into the gourd. Inside, he saw halls of jade, resplendent and grand, filled with fine wine and delicacies. They drank together, and upon leaving, the old man warned him not to speak of this to anyone.\n\nLater, the old man came to Changfang’s upper room and said, “I am an immortal, punished for some transgression. I must now depart—would you follow me?” Below the room, there was a small amount of wine for their farewell. Changfang had twenty men try to lift it, but they could not budge it. The old man laughed, picked it up with a single finger, and carried it upstairs. The vessel appeared to hold no more than a liter, yet the two drank from it all day without exhausting it.\n\nChangfang wished to seek the Dao but worried for his family. The old man, knowing his thoughts, cut a green bamboo and had him hang it behind his house. His family saw it and, mistaking it for Changfang, believed he had hanged himself. They wailed in grief and prepared his funeral. Changfang stood beside them, unseen.\n\nThen he followed the old man into the mountains, treading through thorns amid a pack of tigers. The old man left him alone, yet Changfang felt no fear. Later, he was placed in an empty room, where a rotten rope suspended a large stone above him. Snakes slithered forth, gnawing at the rope, nearly severing it, but Changfang did not flinch. The old man returned and patted him, saying, “You are teachable.”\n\nHe then made Changfang eat excrement, which contained three worms, foul and vile beyond measure. Changfang found it revolting. The old man said, “You were nearly perfected in the Dao, but this alone remains unfinished. What can be done?” Changfang asked to return home. The old man gave him a bamboo staff, saying, “Ride this wherever you wish, and you will arrive in an instant. When you reach home, cast the staff into Ge Pond.” Changfang mounted the staff and returned in moments, believing he had been gone only ten days, though in truth, over a decade had passed.\n\nHe threw the staff into the pond, and when he looked back, it had transformed into a dragon. His family, mourning his long death, were astonished and disbelieving. Changfang said, “What you buried was only a bamboo staff.” They opened the tomb and split the coffin, finding the staff still inside. Thereafter, Changfang could heal all manner of illnesses and lash the hundred ghosts.\n\nOnce, he fed a guest and sent a servant to buy fresh fish in the Song market. The servant returned in an instant with the meal prepared. Huan Jing had once studied under Changfang.

He entered Mount Zhongnan, where he suddenly encountered a Daoist who imparted secret teachings. The master warned him: *\"At the southern inquiry of Nanyang, on the sunny bank of the rushing waters, there lies a mountain spirit’s hall and grotto. Beside it, the divine will open your homeland—go there, and you may gather your spirit in the boundless vastness.\"*\n\nMaster Clad-in-Hemp sought the place and was guided by a woodcutter. He dwelled in the grotto for nineteen years. During the great drought of the Jin Yixi era, the local magistrate Zhang Shi led the people to beg for rain. Master Clad-in-Hemp replied that he had no such arts, but the supplicants persisted. That night, twelve youths appeared to him, saying: *\"If they ask again, simply agree.\"* Perplexed, he consented. The next day, heavy rain fell. The twelve returned to bow, declaring: *\"We are dragons. The Celestial Emperor, seeing your Daoist practice complete, has sent us to assist your transformative work.\"*\n\nIn the early years of the Liu Song Daming era, at the age of one hundred and one, he sat solemnly and achieved *shijie*—liberation through the corpse.\n\n**Ma Gu**\nMa Gu was the younger sister of the immortal Wang Fangping. During the reign of Emperor Huan of Han, Fangping descended to the home of Cai Jing and said: *\"You are destined for transcendence, so I have come to instruct you. But your *qi* is weak and your flesh abundant—you cannot ascend to heaven at once. You must achieve *shijie* instead.\"* He imparted essential teachings and departed.\n\nLater, Cai Jing suddenly grew feverish as if aflame. After three days, his flesh melted and his bones straightened. He entered his chamber, covered himself with a quilt, and vanished. Only a cast-off form like a snake’s sloughed skin remained. Over a decade later, he unexpectedly returned home and told his family: *\"On the tenth day of the seventh month, Lord Wang will come again. Prepare several hundred *hu* of wine for him.\"*\n\nOn that day, Fangping arrived wearing a *yuanyou* cap, riding a five-dragon chariot, preceded and followed by banners and insignia like a great general. When his retinue arrived, his attendants all vanished. After Cai Jing’s father and brothers paid their respects, Fangping sent someone to summon Ma Gu.\n\nSoon after, Ma Gu arrived. The entire Cai household saw her—she appeared about eighteen, her hair coiled atop her head with the rest cascading to her waist. Her embroidered robes shimmered with dazzling light. Once seated, she went to the kitchen herself, preparing delicacies like *pilin* jerky, served in vessels of gold and jade.\n\nAt the time, Cai Jing’s wife had just given birth. Ma Gu saw her and said: *\"Ah, stay back for now.\"* She took a handful of rice, scattered it on the ground, and it turned to cinnabar.

      "translated_text": "Lü Yan, styled Dongbin, was a native of Yongle County in Pu Prefecture during the Tang dynasty, and was known as Master Pure Yang. When his mother was about to give birth, an extraordinary fragrance filled the room, celestial music floated in the air, and a white crane descended from the heavens, flying into the bed curtains before vanishing. At birth, his form was golden and his essence wooden, with the crown of a crane and the back of a tortoise. His phoenix eyes gazed toward the sky, and his brows extended into his temples. From childhood, he was exceptionally bright, memorizing ten thousand words a day and composing essays extemporaneously. Standing eight feet and two inches tall, he resembled Zhang Zifang, yet remained unmarried at twenty.\n\nWhile still in swaddling clothes, Master Ma saw him and said: *\"This child’s bone structure is uncommon—he is naturally beyond the mundane world. When you later encounter a hut, dwell there; when you see a bell, strike it. Keep this in mind.\"* Later, while traveling on Mount Lu, he met the True Fire Dragon, who transmitted to him the Heavenly Escape Sword Method.\n\nDuring the Huichang era of the Tang, he twice sat for the imperial examinations but did not pass. At sixty-four, while wandering through a wine shop in Chang’an, he saw a Daoist in a blue headscarf and white robe casually inscribing a quatrain on the wall:\n\n*\"Seated outside, I always clutch a jug of wine,\nLest my eyes ever recognize the starry capital.\nHeaven and earth permit one so nameless—\nA carefree man amid the mortal world.\"*\n\nDongbin marveled at the Daoist’s archaic and extraordinary appearance, as well as the transcendent spirit of his verse. He bowed and inquired after his name. The Daoist replied: *\"I am Master Yunfang, dwelling on Crane Ridge in Zhongnan. Would you follow me?\"* Dongbin did not immediately answer, so Yunfang invited him to rest together in the shop. Yunfang personally prepared the meal, but Dongbin suddenly fell into a deep sleep, pillowing his head. He dreamed he was a scholar traveling to the capital, passing the imperial examination as *zhuangyuan*, rising from a minor official to censor, then to the Hanlin Academy and the Secret Pavilion, assuming every prestigious post. He married twice into wealthy families, his children married early, and nearly forty years passed. He then served as prime minister for a decade, his power and influence overwhelming, until he was suddenly charged with a grave crime. His family’s wealth was confiscated, his wives and children scattered, and he was exiled to the southern mountains. Alone, he stood on horseback amid wind and snow, sighing deeply—until he awoke with a start to find the rice still uncooked.\n\nYunfang laughed and said: *\"The millet is not yet done—yet you’ve dreamed your way to Huaxu.\"* Dongbin exclaimed: *\"Master, did you know my dream?\"* Yunfang replied: *\"The dream you just had—its rises and falls, its thousand joys and sorrows—were but an instant in fifty years. What is gained is not worth rejoicing over; what is lost is not worth grieving. Only when one attains great awakening does one realize that the human world is but a grand dream.\"* Dongbin was deeply moved and bowed to Yunfang, seeking the method of transcending the world. Yunfang tested him, saying: *\"Your bones are not yet perfected. To transcend the world, you must endure several more lifetimes.\"* Then he departed gracefully.\n\nDongbin immediately abandoned Confucian studies and retreated into seclusion. From then on, Yunfang subjected Dongbin to ten trials:\n\n**First Trial:** Dongbin returned from afar to find his entire family dead. His heart held no regret—he merely prepared generous funeral rites. Suddenly, the dead all revived, unharmed.\n\n**Second Trial:** Dongbin sold goods in the market, agreeing on a price, but the buyer abruptly paid only half. Dongbin made no argument, leaving the goods behind and departing.\n\n**Third Trial:** On New Year’s Day, Dongbin encountered a beggar at his gate seeking alms. He gave money and goods, but the beggar demanded more, cursing and insulting him. Dongbin only smiled and bowed repeatedly.\n\n**Fourth Trial:** While herding sheep in the mountains, Dongbin met a starving tiger chasing his flock. He stood alone before it, and the tiger retreated.\n\n**Fifth Trial:** While reading in a thatched hut in the mountains, a woman of unparalleled beauty, her radiance dazzling, appeared. She claimed to have lost her way returning from her parents’ home and sought rest. She then made countless advances, yet Dongbin remained unmoved.\n\n**Sixth Trial:** One day, Dongbin left home and returned to find all his possessions stolen. He showed no anger, supporting himself through farming. While plowing, he uncovered dozens of gold pieces but quickly covered them, taking nothing.\n\n**Seventh Trial:** Dongbin bought copper vessels from a merchant, only to find them turned to gold upon returning home. He sought out the seller and returned them.\n\n**Eighth Trial:** A mad Daoist sold medicine by the roadside, claiming it would kill anyone who took it, though they would attain the Dao in their next life. Dongbin bought it, and the Daoist said: *\"Prepare your funeral rites at once.\"* He took the medicine without ill effect.\n\n**Ninth Trial:** During spring floods, Dongbin crossed a river with others. Midway, wind and waves surged violently, and all grew fearful. Dongbin sat unmoved.\n\n**Tenth Trial:** While sitting alone in a room, countless grotesque ghosts and demons appeared, some striking, some attempting to kill him. Dongbin showed no fear. Suddenly, a rebuke rang out from the void, and the spirits vanished. A man descended, clapping and laughing—it was Yunfang. He said: *\"I have tested you ten times, and you remained unmoved. You are certain to attain the Dao. Now I will teach you the arts of alchemy, to aid the world and benefit all beings. When your three thousand merits are complete and your eight hundred deeds perfected, I will come to deliver you.\"*\n\nDongbin asked: *\"Will the works of metal and wood transformation change?\"* Yunfang replied: *\"After three thousand years, they will return to their original nature.\"* Dongbin sighed: *\"To mislead people three thousand years hence—I will not do it.\"* Yunfang smiled: *\"With such a heart, your three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds are already fulfilled.\"* He then took Dongbin to Crane Ridge, transmitting all the secret methods of the highest immortals, along with *The Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure* and several grains of elixir.\n\nAs they finished, two immortals descended, bearing a golden tablet and a sacred talisman, announcing to Yunfang: *\"The Emperor of Heaven summons you to select immortals for the Golden Tower of the Nine Heavens.\"* Yunfang said to Dongbin: *\"I go now to answer the imperial decree. Remain in the world, cultivate merit, and establish virtue. In time, you too shall be as I.\"*",

I must first deliver all sentient beings in the world before I shall ascend.\"* Thereupon, Yunfang rose slowly upon the clouds and departed.\n\nHaving received Yunfang’s Dao, along with the *Heavenly Concealment Sword Method* of the Fire Dragon Perfected, Dongbin began his travels through the Jiang and Huai regions. Testing his numinous sword, he eradicated the scourge of dragons, concealing and revealing himself through transformations for over four hundred years. He often wandered among the Xiang, Tan, Yue, and E regions, as well as the lands of Liangzhe, Bian, and Qiao, unknown to all. He called himself the Returning Daoist.\n\nDuring the *Zhenghe* era of the Song, a malevolent spirit plagued the palace, appearing in broad daylight to steal gold and treasures. The imperial consorts and concubines observed pure fasts and offered sincere prayers, presenting memorials for sixty days. One day, as the emperor dozed, he saw a Daoist outside the *Shuhua Gate*, wearing a kingfisher-blue lotus crown and a purple crane-feather cloak, holding a crystal *ruyi*. The Daoist bowed and said: *\"Your servant comes by the Emperor of Heaven’s decree to subdue this spirit.\"* He then summoned a golden-armored warrior, who seized the spirit and tore it apart, devouring it nearly whole.\n\nThe emperor asked who the warrior was. The Daoist replied: *\"This is the *Chongning Perfected Lord* Guan Yu, whom Your Majesty has enfeoffed.\"* The emperor expressed repeated gratitude, then inquired about Zhang Fei’s whereabouts. Guan Yu said: *\"Zhang Fei has been my companion through countless kalpas, reborn in every life as a man. Now, he has been born to Your Majesty in the household of the Yue family of Xiangzhou.\"*\n\nThe emperor then asked the Daoist’s name. The Daoist replied: *\"Your servant is surnamed Yang, born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month.\"* The emperor awoke and recorded the dream, realizing it had been Dongbin. From then on, the palace was at peace. A decree was issued that all places where Dongbin was venerated with incense should bestow upon him the title *Zheng Miaotong Perfected Realized One*.

      "translated_text": "Zuo Ci, styled Yuanfang, was a native of Lujiang. He refined his thoughts and studied the Dao in the Tianzhu Mountains, where he obtained the *Elixir Canon* from a stone chamber. He was especially versed in the Six Jia and could command ghosts and spirits. With a mere thought, he could summon traveling kitchens and transform myriad forms. When Cao Cao summoned him, he was confined to a chamber and made to fast for a full year; upon emerging, his complexion remained unchanged.\n\nOnce, during a grand banquet, Cao Cao remarked, *\"Today’s gathering is splendid, but it lacks only the perch of Songjiang.\"* Zuo Ci then requested a bronze basin filled with water and a fishing rod, and at once caught a perch. Cao Cao said, *\"What a pity we have no ginger from Shu.\"* Zuo Ci replied, *\"That is easily obtained.\"* Fearing Zuo Ci might fetch it from nearby, Cao Cao quickly said, *\"The envoy I sent earlier to buy brocade should be rewarded with twenty additional bolts.\"* Zuo Ci assented, then tossed his cup into the air, transforming into a crane and vanishing. Moments later, he produced ginger from his sleeve. When the brocade-buyer returned, he confirmed that he had indeed received the additional bolts that very day.\n\nCao Cao once went to the outskirts with a hundred attendants. Zuo Ci provided each with a sheng of wine and a catty of dried meat, pouring the drinks himself; all the officials became drunk and sated. Cao Cao found this strange and inspected the cauldrons, only to find all the wine and meat gone. Displeased by his uncanny powers, Cao Cao had Zuo Ci seized to execute him. Zuo Ci retreated into a wall, vanishing without a trace. Later, he was spotted in the marketplace, but when pursuers tried to capture him, all the townspeople transformed to resemble him, making it impossible to distinguish the real one. Another time, he was encountered on the summit of Yangcheng Mountain; when chased, he fled into a flock of sheep. Realizing he could not be caught, Cao Cao sent a messenger to say, *\"I will no longer seek to kill you—this was merely a test of your arts.\"*\n\nSuddenly, an old sheep knelt on its forelegs, stood upright, and spoke: *\"Why send such haste to seize me?\"* Then, the entire flock of several hundred sheep transformed into sheep, all standing and saying, *\"Why send such haste? None can be taken.\"* None knew which to seize.\n\n---\n\nHan Xiangzi, styled Qingfu, was the nephew of Han Wengong. Free-spirited and unrestrained, he met Master Chunyang and became his disciple. After climbing a peach tree and falling to his death, he underwent *shijie* and returned to see Wengong, who urged him to study. Han Xiang replied, *\"My learning differs from yours.\"* He then composed a poem to express his aspirations:\n\n*\"The green mountains, the clouds, the water’s hollow—\nthis place is my home.\nAt midnight, I feast on jade nectar;\nat dawn, I chew crimson mist.\nMy zither plays the tune of the Azure King;\nmy furnace refines white cinnabar.\nThe golden tiger guards the precious tripod;\nwhite crows tend the fields of lingzhi.\nA gourd holds the workings of creation;\na three-foot blade slays demons and fiends.\nI can brew wine for border patrols\nand make flowers bloom in an instant.\nWhoever can learn from me\nshall behold the immortal blossoms.\"*\n\nWengong read it and said, *\"Can you truly seize the workings of creation?\"* Han Xiang then prepared wine, and it instantly became fine vintage. He gathered soil, and before long, a blue flower bloomed, from which emerged a golden couplet:\n\n*\"Clouds veil the Qin Ridge—where is home?\nSnow chokes the Blue Pass—my horse cannot advance.\"*\n\nWengong read it but did not understand its meaning.

Wengong inquired as to their location, and indeed, it was the Blue Pass. Sighing deeply, he said, *\"I shall complete the poem for you.\"* Thereupon, he recited from the *Collected Works of Han*: *\"A memorial to the ninefold heavens at dawn...\"* They lodged that night at the Blue Pass post station, and Wengong at last believed Xiang had not deceived him.

      "translated_text": "In the second year of the Wu Red Crow era, his mother dreamed of a golden phoenix bearing a pearl in its beak, which fell into her palm. She swallowed it in surprise, and thus conceived, giving birth to the Perfected Lord. From childhood, he was open-minded and unburdened by worldly concerns. Once, while hunting, he shot a deer, which fell dead. The mother deer circled and licked its wound in grief. Moved by this, he cast aside his bow and arrows.\n\nDedicated to learning, he mastered the classics and histories, but his deepest passion lay in the arts of Daoist cultivation and immortality. Hearing that Wu Meng of Xi’an had obtained the divine formulas of Ding Yi, he journeyed to study under him, receiving all his secrets and devoting himself daily to refinement. One day, he purchased an iron lampstand and, lighting it at night, noticed that where the lacquer had peeled away, a golden glow shone through. The next day, he sought out the seller and returned the treasure.\n\nIn the first year of Emperor Wu of Jin’s Taikang reign, he was recommended as a Filial and Incorruptible scholar and appointed magistrate of Jingyang County, where officials and people alike revered him. During a famine, when the people had nothing to offer in tribute, the Perfected Lord transmuted tiles and pebbles into gold with an elixir, secretly burying them in the county garden. One day, he summoned those who had not yet paid their taxes to labor in the garden. As they tilled the soil, they unearthed the gold, using it to fulfill their obligations, and thus all was settled in peace.\n\nLater, a great plague struck, killing seven or eight out of ten. The Perfected Lord treated the afflicted with the divine formulas he had obtained, and soon, the sick from neighboring prefectures flocked to him. He planted bamboo outside the city walls and placed talismanic water beneath it, instructing the people to drink there—all who did were cured. Over time, sensing the coming chaos of the Jin dynasty, he resigned his post and returned home. Resting one day beneath a bridge grove, five maidens approached, each bearing a precious sword. Marveling, he accepted them. The maidens then accompanied him to his home, where they spent their days striking the swords in play. Recognizing them as sword immortals, he ultimately mastered the use of these divine blades.\n\nLater, the Great Wu Lord traveled to Huang Hall in Danyang and heard of the adept Chen Mu, who possessed many Daoist arts. Together, they sought her to inquire into the mysteries of the Dao. Chen Mu said: *\"Long ago, the Filial and Fraternal King descended upon the household of Lan Gong in Qufu. He told Lan Gong: ‘In a later age of the Jin, a divine immortal named Xu Xun will appear, to whom I shall transmit this Way. I leave behind the Golden Elixir and the Treasured Canon, the Bronze Talismans and the Iron Charter. I press them into my palm to await him.’ Many years have passed, and now I shall bestow them upon you.\"* She then chose an auspicious day, ascended the altar, and transmitted all the secrets of the Filial and Fraternal King to him.\n\nThe Perfected Lord, his heart set on the Way, visited Chen Mu every year. One day, she perceived his intent and said: *\"Do not come again, for I shall soon return to the Emperor’s realm.\"* She plucked a blade of fragrant grass, faced south, and cast it, saying: *\"When you return, build my shrine where this grass falls. A single visit each autumn will suffice.\"* The two lords returned and searched for where the flying grass had landed, erecting a shrine there. Every year on the third day of mid-autumn, they paid their respects.\n\nEarlier, when the Perfected Lord had gone to seek the flying grass, he rested at Zhenjing and witnessed villagers preparing lavish feasts to sacrifice to a deity. They warned one another: *\"If the offering is meager, the spirit will grow angry and bring disaster.\"* The Perfected Lord declared: *\"How dare such a demonic force act thus!\"* He summoned wind and thunder to strike it down, uprooting its sacred grove. The next day, he told the villagers: *\"The malevolent shrine has been driven away—no more sacrifices are needed.\"*\n\nSeeing the people suffer from fetching water from afar, he struck the ground before the shrine with his staff, and a spring gushed forth to aid them, never failing even in drought. Crossing the Xiao Shu River, he was warmly received by a riverside host named Zhu. In jest, he drew a pine tree on the wall of Zhu’s home, which thereafter brought the family double their usual fortune. Later, when the river overflowed and destroyed the embankment, sweeping away the market and homes, only the wall bearing the pine remained unharmed.\n\nPassing through Xi’an County, the Perfected Lord came upon a small temple. The temple deity appeared and said: *\"A flood dragon has been harming the people here. Knowing you were coming, it fled to Ezhu.\"* Arriving at Ezhu, he met three elders who pointed and said: *\"The dragon hides beneath the bridge ahead.\"* The Perfected Lord approached the bridge, brandished his sword, and rebuked it. The creature writhed in terror and fled into the great river, concealing itself in the depths. He then mobilized officials and soldiers to drive it out and slew it.\n\nAt the time, in Shangliao of Haihun, a giant serpent had burrowed into a mountain, its breath forming clouds that stretched forty *li*. People and livestock caught in its vapors were devoured, making it a scourge to the people. Hearing of this, the Perfected Lord sent his disciple ahead to the serpent’s lair. Wielding his sword and deploying a black talisman, he frightened the serpent into its den. He then issued a flying talisman to summon the local earth deity of Haihun to drive it out. The serpent emerged, rearing its head over ten *zhang* high, its eyes like torches, spewing venom into the sky.\n\nThe Perfected Lord whistled, commanding wind and thunder, and summoned divine soldiers to subdue it, rendering it immobile. He then strode forward, planted his foot upon its head, and cleaved its skull with his sword.",

      "translated_text": "The disciples Shi Cen, Gan Ji, and others led the troops to strike the serpent, splitting its belly open. From within emerged a smaller serpent, several *zhang* in length. Lord Gan wished to slay it, but the Perfected Lord said, \"It has yet to cause harm—we cannot kill it without just cause. In one thousand two hundred and fifty years, it will become a scourge to the people, and I shall return to slay it then. As proof, plant a parasol tree before my altar; when its branches sweep the ground, that will be the time.\" He then foretold, \"One thousand two hundred and forty years after my departure as an immortal, within the borders of Yuzhang and the Five Mounds, eight hundred earthbound immortals shall emerge. When the small serpent becomes a menace, they will surely slay it.\" The serpent’s offspring then fled into the river.\n\nThe Perfected Lord said, \"Though the great serpent is destroyed, the *jiao* spirit remains unpunished. I fear it may seize an opportunity to flood the prefectural city. Let us return to the capital.\" With Lords Gan and Shi, he surveyed the city and encountered a youth who introduced himself as surnamed Shen, his manner respectful and his responses quick. The Perfected Lord told his disciples, \"The one who just left is no ordinary man—it was the old *jiao*, testing us.\" Tracing its path, they found it at the river’s edge in the prefectural city, where it had transformed into a yellow ox upon the sandy shoals. The Perfected Lord cut paper into a black ox and sent it to challenge the beast, instructing Shi Cen to lie in wait with his sword and strike when their battle grew fierce. Lord Shi’s blow severed its left thigh, and the ox fled into the city’s south. By the time it reached Changsha, it had resumed human form and entered the household of the merchant Yu Sijun.\n\nPreviously, the *jiao* spirit had coveted Yu’s beautiful daughter and, transforming into a handsome youth, sought an audience with him. Yu, admiring his talent, gave his daughter to him in marriage. For several years, they lived together, bearing two sons. Every spring and summer, the *jiao* would depart alone, returning in autumn aboard a massive ship laden with heavy cargo—plunder from vessels capsized during the floods. That autumn, it returned empty-handed, claiming to Yu, \"Bandits seized my wealth and wounded my left thigh.\" Yu sought physicians to treat it, and the Perfected Lord arrived in the guise of a healer. Pleased, Yu summoned his son-in-law, but the *jiao*, sensing danger, dared not emerge. The Perfected Lord followed him to the hall and thundered, \"River and lake *jiao* spirit, your harm to living things is grave! I have tracked you here—how dare you hide? Come forth at once!\" Cornered, the *jiao* revealed its true form, writhing as a serpent beneath the hall, where the divine soldiers slew it. The Perfected Lord sprinkled its two sons with enchanted water, and they too transformed into small *jiao*, which were likewise executed.\n\nThe Perfected Lord warned Yu, \"Beneath the *jiao*’s dwelling, the depths plunge immeasurably into surging waves. You must relocate swiftly.\" Yu moved to higher ground, and the site indeed collapsed into an abyss. The Perfected Lord then returned to Yuzhang, but the *jiao*’s remaining followers thrived, fearing his wrath. They disguised themselves as humans, claiming, \"Our family hails from Chang’an, generations devoted to virtue. We have long heard of the esteemed Master Xu’s divine sword and wish to witness its power.\" The disciples replied, \"Our master’s sword can split the heavens when pointed upward and cleave the earth when aimed downward. No evil dares stand before it—it is a treasure of gods and sages.\" The *jiao*’s followers said, \"There are things it cannot harm.\" The disciples teased, \"Only winter melons and gourds.\" The *jiao* party took this as truth and transformed en masse into gourds and winter melons, floating and bobbing upon the river. The Perfected Lord, recognizing their ruse, handed his sword to Shi Cen, who strode across the water and slew them all without exception. Thus, the water demons were purged, and the city knew peace.\n\nIn the second year of Emperor Ming’s *Taining* reign, the grand general Wang Dun marched his army inward, halting at Cihu Lake. The Perfected Lord and Lord Wu went to pay their respects, but Wang, swayed by other counsel, sought to detain them. At the time, Guo Pu was in Wang’s camp, and the Perfected Lord insisted he accompany them to the meeting. Wang, pleased, welcomed them and asked over drinks, \"I dreamed of a tree splitting the sky—what do you make of it?\" The Perfected Lord replied, \"It is an ill omen.\" Lord Wu added, \"A tree splitting the sky forms the character *wei* (未, ‘not yet’)—you should not act rashly.\" Wang’s expression darkened, and he ordered Guo Pu to divine the outcome. Guo said, \"It will not succeed.\" Enraged, Wang commanded his guards to seize and execute Guo. The Perfected Lord then cast his cup to the ground, where it transformed into a white crane that circled the rafters. When Wang looked up again, the two lords had vanished. Later, Wang’s rebellion failed.\n\nThe two lords returned to Jinling, intending to hire a boat to Yuzhang. The boatman lamented the lack of a skilled oarsman. The Perfected Lord said, \"Simply close your eyes and sit calmly—do not look around. I will steer for you.\" Silently summoning two dragons to flank the vessel, they set off. The boat gradually ascended into the air, soon passing over the summit of Mount Lu before arriving at the Golden Palace Grotto on Purple Cloud Peak. The boatman, bowing, begged for salvation. The Perfected Lord taught him to ingest sacred herbs, enabling him to abstain from grain and achieve immortality, whereupon he secluded himself in the mountain. The two lords each mounted a dragon and returned to their former hermitage, where for decades they paid no heed to worldly affairs, devoting themselves solely to the cultivation of the supreme Dao.\n\nIn the second year of Emperor Xiaowu’s *Ningkang* reign, the Perfected Lord was two hundred and thirty-six years old. On the first day of the eighth month, two immortals descended from the heavens, announcing, \"By the Jade Emperor’s decree, you are appointed Sovereign of the Immortals of the Nine Provinces and Grand Envoy of the Celestial Bureau of Astronomy. We also come to inform you of your ascension.\" They then departed in a cloud chariot. On the fifteenth of that month, celestial music filled the air as auspicious clouds drifted by, bearing feathered canopies and dragon-drawn carriages. Divine soldiers and attendants, jade lads and maidens, escorted the Perfected Lord into the dragon carriage. He ascended with his father’s clan and their retinue, while Xu Lie ascended with his mother’s kin and theirs. Forty-two members of their immortal households ascended to heaven in broad daylight, even their chickens and dogs following. For a hundred *li* around, a wondrous fragrance lingered for months.\n\n**Master Immortal Ge**\nGe Xuan, styled Xiaoxian, was a native of Jurong in Danyang.

      "translated_text": "Once, while dining with guests and discussing matters of transformation, a guest said, \"Master, would you perform something for amusement?\" Ge Xuan replied, \"Do you seek to hasten me? Do you wish to witness something?\" He then spat out the rice from his mouth, which instantly multiplied into several hundred grains that gathered upon the guests’ bodies. When someone asked him to open his mouth, a swarm of bees flew in, and upon chewing, they turned back into the same rice. He could point at stone statues to make them walk, or at toads, insects, swallows, and sparrows, compelling them to sing, dance, and keep rhythm as if they were human. When hosting banquets in winter, he would serve fresh melons and dates, and in summer, he would conjure ice and snow. When no one passed the wine cups, they would move to the guests on their own, and if the wine was not finished, the cups would not depart.\n\nEmperor Wu of Jin summoned him and asked, \"The people long for rain—can you bring it?\" Ge Xuan replied, \"It is easy.\" He wrote a talisman and placed it in the village shrine, and soon after, a heavy rain fell. Once, while traveling, he passed a spirit shrine. The custom was to dismount and bow a hundred paces before it, or else misfortune would strike. Ge Xuan, however, ordered his carriage to drive straight ahead. Immediately, a fierce wind arose, blotting out the sky with dust. Enraged, he declared, \"How dare a petty spirit act so!\" He wrote a talisman and had his disciple cast it into the shrine, whereupon the building burst into flames.\n\nPassing through Wukang, he saw a household afflicted by illness, where a shaman was performing rites to expel malevolent spirits. The spirit possessing the shaman drank with Ge Xuan but refused to partake himself. When the spirit spoke insolently, Ge Xuan rebuked it sternly: \"How dare you, wicked ghost!\" He commanded the Five Marshals to drag the spirit by the head, bind it to a pillar, and flog its back until blood flowed upon the ground. The spirit admitted its guilt, and the punishment ceased.\n\nIn Huayin, he encountered a scholar whose wife was a serpent spirit, having devoured countless people over time. The scholar did not believe him, so Ge Xuan transformed into a peasant plowing with a yellow calf. He led the scholar to an ancient well, where white bones filled its depths. Terrified, the scholar was then shown how to spy on his wife’s true form, and indeed, she was a serpent. Ge Xuan restrained and beheaded her, then gave the scholar a talisman to ingest. Afterward, the scholar purged countless worms and toads, and his life was preserved.\n\nOnce, while refining elixirs on Purple Beneficence Mountain in Jingmen, the weather turned bitterly cold. Ge Xuan’s feet were bare, and his robes were tattered. Two daughters of the Qu family, happening upon him, took pity and secretly crafted a pair of shoes, presenting them the next day. By then, Ge Xuan had already departed, leaving only warm ashes in his furnace. The sisters sifted through the ashes and found a single elixir pellet, which they divided and consumed. Thereafter, their spirits soared, and they neither hungered nor thirsted. The people of the time all said they had attained the Dao.\n\nOnce, while sailing with King Wu of the Eastern Wu kingdom at the mouth of the Three Rivers, a storm arose, and many boats were lost. The king lamented, \"Master Ge is a man of the Dao—how could he not escape this calamity?\" Suddenly, Ge Xuan appeared, walking upon the water. When he arrived, he still bore the flush of wine. He apologized, saying, \"Yesterday, Wu Zixu insisted on detaining me for drinks, which is why I have kept Your Majesty waiting.\"\n\nOn the western peak, he once pounded medicine in a stone mortar within a cliffside. A single grain fell, and a bird that ate it became immortal. To this day, on moonlit, wind-clear nights, the sound of a pestle can still be heard—this is the \"Pounding Medicine Crow.\"\n\nWhen the immortal Qin Gao heard that Ge Xuan had attained the Dao, he rode a pair of carp from the Eastern Sea to visit him. After drinking to intoxication, Qin Gao asked, \"When will I sober?\" Ge Xuan replied, \"When the white clouds part.\" The carp then turned to stone, and Ge Xuan gifted him a pair of cranes to ride home. The stone remains to this day.\n\nOnce, while boating with a guest, the guest saw a dozen or so talismans in Ge Xuan’s bag. He asked, \"Can these talismans be tested?\" Ge Xuan took one and cast it into the water, where it drifted downstream. The guest said, \"Even an ordinary person could do that.\" Ge Xuan took another and cast it in, whereupon it flowed upstream. The guest exclaimed, \"Remarkable!\" Ge Xuan cast a third talisman, which neither sank nor floated. After a moment, the upstream and downstream talismans converged in the current, and after a long while, he retrieved them.\n\nBy the riverside, he saw a man preparing to cook a large fish. Ge Xuan said to the fisherman, \"May I borrow this fish to present to the River Earl?\" The fisherman replied, \"It is already dead.\" Ge Xuan said, \"Even so, write a talisman on paper, place it in the fish’s mouth, and cast it into the water.\" The fish leapt away, alive.\n\nSuch divine marvels are too numerous to recount in full. Later, he ascended as an immortal.",

At fourteen or fifteen, she dreamed of a divine being who instructed her, “Consume powdered mica, and you shall become weightless and deathless.” She partook of it and thereupon vowed never to marry. She often wandered among the mountains and valleys, her movements swift as flight. Each morning she would depart, returning at dusk with mountain fruits to present to her mother. Later, she gradually ceased eating grain.\n\nEmpress Wu dispatched envoys to summon her to court, but along the way, she vanished.

When the emperor offered him wine, he declined, saying, \"Your humble servant’s limit is no more than two *sheng*. I have a disciple who can drink one *dou*.\" Emperor Minghuang was delighted and ordered the disciple summoned. In an instant, a young Daoist descended from the palace eaves, appearing fifteen or sixteen years old, with a handsome bearing and graceful steps. The emperor commanded him to sit, but the youth said, \"Your disciple should stand in attendance.\" Minghuang was even more pleased and offered him a small *dou* of wine. The disciple declined, saying, \"I must not be given more than this.\" The emperor insisted, and as he drank, wine surged from the top of his head, knocking his cap to the ground. Suddenly, he transformed into a golden hairpin. The emperor and his consorts gasped and laughed, only to find the Daoist gone—nothing remained but the golden comb on the floor. Upon inspection, it proved to be the hairpin from the Jixian Institute, which could hold no more than a *dou* of wine.\n\nThe emperor said to Gao Lishi, \"I have heard that one who can drink leather without discomfort is an extraordinary man.\" As the weather was cold, he took some to drink. After three cups, Zhang Guo slumped and said, \"This is not fine wine.\" He then fell asleep. Soon, his teeth withered and shrank into his right cheek. He struck them loose with his *ruyi*, tucked them into his sash, and applied medicine. After a while, his teeth regrew, gleaming like jade.\n\nDuring a hunt in Xianyang, the emperor captured a large deer and ordered the imperial kitchen to prepare it. Zhang Guo said, \"This is a celestial deer, already a thousand years old. In the fifth year of *Yuanshou* during Emperor Wu of Han’s reign, I once accompanied him on a hunt in Shanglin Park. We caught this deer and released it.\" The emperor said, \"There are many deer, and eras have changed—how could it still live?\" Zhang Guo replied, \"When Emperor Wu released it, he marked it with a bronze plaque beneath its left antler.\" They examined it and found a bronze plaque about two *cun* long, though the inscription had worn away.\n\nThe emperor asked Ye Fashan, \"Who is Zhang Guo?\" Ye replied, \"I know, but if I speak, I will die.

Ye said, \"At the dawn of creation, he was the essence of the white bat.\" Before he finished, blood streamed from his seven orifices, and he collapsed. The emperor rushed to Zhang Guo’s quarters, removed his crown, washed his feet, and confessed his fault. Zhang Guo slowly said, \"This child speaks too freely. If not punished, he might reveal the secrets of heaven and earth.\" The emperor pleaded earnestly, and after some time, Zhang Guo sprinkled water on Ye’s face, reviving him.\n\nThe emperor held him in even higher esteem and ordered his portrait painted at the Jixian Institute, bestowing the title *Master of Penetrating the Mysteries*.

      "translated_text": "Tao Hongjing, styled Daoming, was a native of Moling. His mother once dreamed of a green dragon emerging from her bosom, and soon after conceived. From birth, he displayed extraordinary conduct as a child. At the age of ten, he encountered Ge Hong’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* and pored over it day and night. He remarked to others, \"Gazing at the azure clouds and beholding the white sun, I feel no distance is too far.\" As he grew, he stood seven *chi* and seven *cun* tall, his bearing luminous and refined, with bright eyes and well-spaced brows. Each ear bore over seventy hairs, extending outward about two *cun*. On his right knee were several dozen dark moles, arranged in the pattern of the Seven Stars. He read ten thousand volumes, excelled at the zither and *weiqi*, and was skilled in cursive and clerical scripts.\n\nIn his youth, when Emperor Gao of Qi served as regent, he was summoned as a tutor to the imperial princes. Though dwelling within the vermilion gates, he kept to himself, shunning external affairs and devoting himself solely to reading. In the tenth year of *Yongming*, he removed his court robes and hung them at the Gate of Divine Martiality, submitting a memorial to resign his salary. The imperial edict granted his request. Thereafter, he settled on Maoshan in Jurong, establishing a retreat named \"Recluse of Flourishing Yang.\" He traversed famous mountains in search of transcendents’ herbs. Whenever he passed through ravines or valleys, he would sit or lie there, chanting and lingering without restraint.\n\nShen Yue, serving as governor of Shuyang, admired his lofty aspirations and integrity, repeatedly sending letters to invite him, but Hongjing never came. He was a man of broad understanding, modest and prudent, his actions attuned to the unseen. His mind was like a bright mirror, comprehending all things at a glance. In the early years of *Yongyuan*, he built a three-story tower, residing at its summit and severing all contact with the world. Only a single household servant was permitted to approach him.",

      "translated_text": "Mar Yuan was skilled in archery and horsemanship, but in his later years, he abandoned both, content merely to listen to the sound of the *sheng* pipe. He had a particular fondness for the wind in the pines, planting them throughout his courtyard, and whenever he heard their rustling, he would delight in it as though it were music. At times, he would wander alone among springs and rocks, and those who caught sight of him all took him for an immortal.\n\nWhen Emperor Wu of Liang ascended the throne, Hongjing cited several instances from prophetic texts and omens that all formed the character for \"Liang,\" instructing his disciples to present them to the emperor. Emperor Wu’s favor and reverence for him deepened. After obtaining divine talismans and secret formulas, Hongjing believed that the elixir of immortality could be achieved, though he lacked the necessary ingredients. The emperor provided him with gold, cinnabar, and other materials, allowing him to compound the \"flying elixir,\" its color like frost and snow. Upon consuming it, his body became light. The emperor, too, experienced its effects and held him in even greater esteem, repeatedly offering official positions, all of which Hongjing declined. He once drew two oxen: one roaming freely among water and grass, the other fitted with a golden halter, driven by a man wielding a whip. Emperor Wu laughed and said, \"This man wishes to be a turtle dragging its tail in the mud—how could he ever be summoned again?\"\n\nThe state consulted him on every major affair, and he came to be known as the \"Prime Minister in the Mountains.\" Though he lived past eighty, his appearance showed no sign of age. Later, when Emperor Jianwen of Liang was stationed in Southern Xuzhou, he admired Hongjing’s noble character and, after retiring to the inner chambers, summoned him. Hongjing arrived wearing a *ge* headdress, conversed with the emperor for several days, and then departed. The emperor held him in profound respect.\n\nWhen his disciple Huan Yun attained the Dao and was about to ascend to heaven, Hongjing asked him, \"I have diligently taught and cultivated the Dao—could it be that some fault still delays my transcendence, while you, Yun, are sent to inquire?\" After Yun ascended and returned, he said to Hongjing, \"Master, your hidden merits are most illustrious, yet in compiling your *Materia Medica*, you have relied on creatures like leeches and other living things. Though your work benefits humanity, it also harms living beings. For this reason, your ascension is deferred for twelve years. Only then will you shed your mortal form and depart the world, becoming the Overseer of Waters in Penglai.\"\n\nHongjing then composed a separate *Materia Medica* in three volumes, substituting plant-based medicines for those derived from living creatures, to atone for his transgressions. One day, sensing his time had come without illness, he predicted the date of his death and wrote a farewell poem. He passed away in the second year of *Datong* at the age of eighty-five. His complexion remained unchanged, his limbs as supple as in life, and a fragrant mist lingered over the mountain for days.\n\n---\n\nPei Hang was a scholar of the *Changqing* era during the Tang dynasty. After failing the imperial examinations, he traveled to Ezhu, where he visited his old acquaintance, the former Chancellor Cui, who gifted him two hundred thousand coins. Pei took the money and returned to the capital, hiring a large boat to sail down the Xiang and Han rivers. On board, he heard that a woman named Lady Fan—a beauty of unmatched grace—was also traveling with them. Unable to catch a glimpse of her, he entrusted a poem to her maid, which read:\n\n*Once, though distant as north and south, I held you in my thoughts,*\n*Now, closer yet veiled behind brocade, you seem a goddess.*\n*If ever you ascend to the jade capital in the heavens,*\n*I would follow the phoenix and crane into the azure skies.*\n\nDays later, the maid returned with Lady Fan’s reply:\n\n*A sip of jade nectar stirs a hundred emotions,*\n*Ground to finest powder, the black frost reveals the cloud spirit.*\n*The Blue Bridge is itself a grotto of immortals—*\n*Why endure the rugged path to the jade capital?*\n\nPei read the poem but felt only shame and admiration, unable to fully grasp its meaning. Upon reaching Xiangyang, Lady Fan had her maid deliver a small casket to him before departing without a word. Pei searched everywhere but found no trace of her.\n\nLater, while passing through Lanqiao Station, parched with thirst, he dismounted to seek a drink. He came upon three or four thatched huts, where an old woman sat spinning hemp. Pei bowed and asked for water. The woman called out, \"Yunying, bring a bowl of water for the gentleman.\" Recalling Lady Fan’s poem, Pei was startled. Moments later, from beneath a reed curtain, a pair of jadelike hands emerged, holding a porcelain bowl. Pei took it and drank—its taste was beyond mere nectar. Returning the bowl, he lifted the curtain to find a girl of radiant beauty. Enraptured, he said to the old woman, \"My servants and horses are exhausted. Might I rest here awhile?\" The woman replied, \"Do as you please.\"\n\nAfter some time, Pei addressed her: \"The young lady I just saw is breathtakingly lovely, her beauty unmatched in the world. I linger here, unable to leave. I would offer a generous bride-price to marry her—would that be possible?\" The woman said, \"I am old and infirm, with only this granddaughter. Recently, an immortal gave her a dose of divine medicine, but it must be ground in a jade mortar and pestle for a hundred days before it can be consumed. If you wish to marry her, you must first obtain a jade mortar and pestle—gold and silk are of no use to me.\"\n\nPei bowed in gratitude and said, \"I will return within a hundred days with the mortar and pestle. I swear I will not offer them to anyone else.\" The woman agreed. Pei traveled to the capital and searched everywhere for a jade mortar and pestle. By chance, he met a jade merchant who said, \"I recently acquired one, but it will cost two hundred strings of cash.\" Pei emptied his purse, sold his servants and horses, and barely scraped together the sum. He then hurried back to Lanqiao, carrying the mortar and pestle alone.\n\nThe old woman laughed upon seeing him: \"In all my years, have I ever met such a man of his word?\" She agreed to the marriage. The girl smiled faintly and said, \"Though this is settled, you must first grind the medicine for a hundred days before we can discuss the wedding.\" The woman then untied a pouch from her sash and handed the medicine to Pei, who began grinding it. Each night, he heard the sound of pounding, and when he peeked, he saw a jade rabbit wielding the pestle.\n\nAfter a hundred days, the woman took the medicine and swallowed it, saying, \"I must enter the grotto to inform our kin and prepare the bridal chamber for Master Pei.\" She then led the girl into the mountains, telling Pei, \"Wait here a moment.\" Soon, carriages and attendants arrived to escort him. Before him stood a grand estate with vermilion gates towering into the clouds. The next day, immortal youths and maidservants led Pei into the bridal chamber, where the rites were completed. Overwhelmed with gratitude, Pei bowed to the old woman. He was then introduced to their kin—all of them immortals. One female immortal, her hair coiled in a cloudlike bun and clad in a rainbow-hued gown, was the girl’s elder sister. After Pei paid his respects, she said, \"Master Pei, did you not once share a boat with my sister from Ezhu to Xiangyang?\"",

She has already ascended among the loftiest transcendents and serves as a scribe to the Jade Emperor.\" The old woman then led Pei and his wife into Jade Peak Grotto, where they dwelled in towers of jade and chambers of pearl. They were fed the cinnabar elixirs of crimson snow and jade blossoms, and their bodies gradually grew pure and ethereal. Their hair turned a lustrous green, their spirits roamed freely, and they transcended to become high immortals. In the Taihe era, Pei’s friend Lu Hao encountered him west of Blue Bridge Post and heard the full account of his attainment of the Dao. Pei then bestowed upon him ten catties of Lantian jade and a single grain of Purple Mansion cloud elixir. Lu bowed deeply and entreated, \"Since you have attained the Dao, I beg a word of instruction.\" Pei replied, \"Laozi said: 'Empty your heart, fill your belly.'\" Lu remained perplexed, so Pei explained further: \"The heart teems with delusive thoughts, the belly leaks vital essence—thus the meaning of emptiness and fullness becomes clear.\" With these words, he suddenly vanished.\n\nSun Simiao\nSun Simiao, a native of Huayuan, could recite a thousand words a day by the age of seven. Dugu Xin, upon seeing him, remarked, \"A sagely child—but his capacity is too vast to be of use.\" As he grew, he delighted in discussing Laozi and Zhuangzi, and withdrew to Mount Taibai to study the Dao, refining his qi and nurturing his spirit in pursuit of the art of transcending the world. He mastered astronomy and delved deeply into medicine and pharmacology, ever devoted to performing hidden acts of virtue. Once, he chanced upon a shepherd boy who had wounded a small snake, its blood flowing. Sun removed his robe to ransom and save it. Ten days later, while traveling, he encountered a youth in white who dismounted and bowed in gratitude, saying, \"My younger brother was saved by your kindness.\" The youth then invited Sun to his home, exchanged his own horse for Sun’s, and together they sped away as if flying. They arrived at a walled city where flowers and trees flourished, gold and jade gleamed, and the splendor resembled an imperial palace. There, a figure in crimson robes and a black hat, surrounded by a vast retinue, hurried forward in joy to greet and thank him: \"Your profound kindness moved me deeply, so I sent my son to welcome you.\" He then pointed to a young servant in green and said, \"This child once ventured out alone and was injured by a shepherd. Thanks to your act of ransoming him with your robe, he lives to this day.\" He ordered the child to bow in gratitude, and Sun then recalled the incident of saving the snake. Quietly, he asked those beside him where he was, and they replied, \"This is the Water Palace of Jingyang.\" The crimson-robed lord ordered wine and a feast prepared, with musicians to entertain Sun. Sun declined, explaining that he abstained from grain and sustained himself with qi, drinking only wine. After three days of revelry, the lord presented him with fine silk and golden pearls, but Sun firmly refused. The lord then commanded his son to fetch thirty rare prescriptions from the Dragon Palace and gave them to Sun, saying, \"These will aid you, a follower of the Dao, in saving lives and benefiting the world.\" Upon returning, Sun tested these prescriptions, and finding them all effective, he compiled them into his *Thousand Gold Prescriptions*. Emperor Wen of Sui summoned him to serve as Erudite of the Imperial Academy, but he declined. Only when Emperor Taizong of Tang called did he journey to the capital.",

      "translated_text": "In the third year of Yonghui (652 CE), Sun had already lived over a hundred years. One day, he bathed, donned his robes and cap, and sat upright, saying to his descendants, \"I shall now journey to the land of Nothingness.\" Soon after, his breath ceased, and though a month passed, his complexion remained unchanged. When his body was placed in the coffin, only his empty garments remained.\n\nLater, the emperor fled to Shu and dreamed of Sun requesting realgar from Wudu. He immediately ordered an imperial envoy to deliver ten catties to the summit of Mount Emei. There, they saw a man in a headscarf and coarse hempen robe, his beard and eyebrows snowy white. Pointing to a large flat stone, he said, \"Place the medicine here.\" When summoned, a memorial of gratitude appeared atop the stone. The envoy saw over a hundred characters inscribed there, which he transcribed as they vanished. Soon, a white mist arose, and the figure suddenly disappeared.\n\nIn Chengdu, a monk devotedly recited the *Lotus Sutra*. One day, a servant arrived, saying, \"The master requests the master’s recitation.\" Passing through misty peaks, they entered a mountain dwelling. The master, clad in rustic garb and leaning on a flowering staff, his ears hanging to his shoulders, burned incense and listened to the recitation. He then offered the monk a rattan tray with bamboo utensils, a bowl of forest rice, and several dishes of wolfberry and chrysanthemum. The monk ate, finding the food as sweet as ambrosia. The master also gave him a string of coins, and the servant escorted him to the road’s end. The monk asked, \"What is the master’s surname?\" \"Sun,\" he replied. \"And his given name?\" The servant wrote two characters in his palm: *Sīmiǎo*. The monk was startled; when he looked again, the servant had vanished, and the coins had turned to gold. From that day, the monk felt light and free of illness, though none knew his whereabouts thereafter.\n\n**Tan Qiao**\nTan Qiao, styled Jingsheng, was precocious in his youth, mastering all texts he read, but he favored the *Biographies of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi*. One day, he informed his parents of his intent to travel to Mount Zhongnan and study under a Daoist master on Mount Song. After more than a decade, he attained the arts of grain avoidance and qi cultivation. Often wandering while intoxicated, he wore a sable coat in summer and a plain cloth robe in winter. Once, in a snowstorm, others thought him dead, but he remained warm and serene. Though he seemed deranged, he would chant as he walked:\n*A thread becomes the Yangtze, a fan the sky,\nStraw sandals cast aside by the eastern sea.\nThe path to Penglai is not far—\nJust ahead, where Tan leans on his staff.*\n\nLater, he resided on Mount Heng, refining the elixir. After consuming it, he ascended as an immortal.\n\n**Xu Xuanping**\nXu Xuanping was a native of She County in Xin’an. During the Jingyun era (710–711 CE) of Emperor Ruizong of Tang, he secluded himself in a southern valley of Chengyang Mountain, building a hut to dwell in. He did not cultivate his appearance or consume medicinal herbs, yet his complexion remained that of a man in his forties. He often carried firewood to sell in the market, his carrying pole always bearing a gourd and a crooked bamboo staff. When drunk, he would stagger home, singing:\n*With firewood on my back, I set out at dawn,\nBuying wine, I return at dusk.\nIf you ask where I live,\nI vanish into the clouds, into the emerald peaks.*\n\nFor over thirty years, he came and went, sometimes aiding those in peril or relieving suffering. Scholars sought him but never found him; they only saw poems inscribed on his hut’s walls:\n*For thirty years I’ve lived in seclusion,\nBuilding my hut atop the southern peak.\nIn the still night, I face the bright moon;\nAt leisure, I drink from the jade-green spring.\nWoodcutters sing on the ridges,\nValley birds play before the cliffs.\nJoyful, I forget my age,\nUnmindful of the passing years.*\n\nDuring the Tianbao era (742–756 CE), Li Bai learned that Xu was an immortal and traveled to Xin’an to seek him, but to no avail. He left a poem on the hut’s wall:\n*I chant poems of the posthouse,\nCome to seek the immortal’s abode.\nMisty peaks obscure the heights,\nCloudy forests veil the void.\nPeering inside, all is desolate;\nLeaning on my staff, I hesitate.\nHe must have transformed into a crane,\nReturning after a thousand years.*\n\nWhen Xu returned and saw the poem, he inscribed his own reply:\n*A pond of lotus leaves, endless robes,\nTwo acres of Solomon’s seal, ample food.\nAgain, men come seeking me—\nI must move my hut deeper into the wilds.*\n\nHis hut was soon consumed by wildfire, and his traces vanished. Over a century later, in the twelfth year of Xiantong (871 CE) under Emperor Yizong, a maidservant of Xu Mingru entered the mountains to gather firewood. Alone in the southern hills, she saw a man sitting on a stone, eating a peach. He asked, \"Are you the maidservant of Xu Mingru?\" She replied, \"Yes.\" \"I am Mingru’s ancestor, Xu Xuanping,\" he said. \"Return and tell Mingru I dwell in these mountains. Take this peach, but eat it here—do not carry it out. The mountain spirit cherishes these peaches, and tigers and wolves abound.\" The maid ate it, finding it delicious, and finished it in moments. He sent her back with the woodcutters, and she found their loads strangely light. Upon returning home, she recounted meeting her ancestor Xu Xuanping in the mountains. Mingru, enraged that she had uttered his ancestor’s name, seized a staff to strike her. As the staff rose, the maid’s body ascended, vanishing without a trace. Later, someone entering the mountains saw the maid with a youthful face, clad in tree bark, moving swiftly as if flying. She entered the deep forest and disappeared.\n\n**Xuan Zhenzi**\nZhang Zhihe, styled Butong, was a native of Jinhua in Tang. His mother dreamed of a maple growing from her belly before his birth. Emperor Suzong, recognizing his brilliance, granted him the name Zhihe and appointed him to the Hanlin Academy. After his parents’ deaths, he withdrew from office, roaming rivers and lakes. He styled himself the \"Fisherman of Mist and Haze\" and later, Xuan Zhenzi. He fished without bait, for his aim was not the catch. He could drink three *dou* of wine without intoxication, preserving his true nature and cultivating qi. He slept in snow without feeling cold and entered water without getting wet. When drunk, he would spread a mat upon the water, sitting alone to drink. The mat moved like a boat, and soon clouds and cranes circled him before alighting. He then mounted a crane and ascended.\n\n**Xuan Yuanji**\nXuan Yuanji’s origins are unknown. Legends claim he lived for centuries without aging, his eyes emitting beams several *zhang* long even in darkness. When he gathered herbs in the mountains, venomous dragons and fierce beasts followed to guard him. If a hundred households invited him to a vegetarian feast, he would divide himself to attend each. When drinking with others, he would produce a small flask from his sleeve, holding only two *sheng*. Yet when poured for guests, it never emptied, even after a full day, while he himself drank a hundred *sheng* without intoxication.",

Emperor Wen of Sui summoned him to serve as Erudite of the Imperial Academy, but he declined. Only when Emperor Taizong of Tang called did he journey to the capital.",

      "translated_text": "He ascended Hangzhou’s Mount Taiwang and composed a poem:\n\n*Where to seek the first division of the Great One?*\n*Only the reckoning remains, shifting mortal hearts.*\n*The sun and moon of the nine heavens change dawn and dusk;*\n*The rivers and mountains of ten thousand li endure from ancient times to now.*\n*Wind stirs the water’s gleam, swallowing distant shores;*\n*Mist thickens twice, engulfing the high forests.*\n*Qin Shi Huang’s foolish scheme to drive away mountains—*\n*The boundless sea only grows deeper still.*\n\nLater, he returned home to visit his elder brother, who happened to be out. He said to his sister-in-law, “I came especially to divide this house with my brother—I desire only the eastern garden.” After waiting three days for his brother’s return without success, he suddenly passed away.\n\nThe next day, his brother returned and, grief-stricken, declared, “My brother studied the Dao for many years; this was his way of severing all expectations through transformation.” He then had the coffin interred in the eastern garden.\n\nThe following year, a report from Dongchuan arrived: a Daoist named Ma Ziran of Zitong County had ascended to heaven in broad daylight. When Hangzhou officials opened his coffin, they found only a bamboo staff.\n\n---\n\n**Zhang Ziyang**\n\nZhang Xiangduan, a native of Tiantai, was studious from youth. In his later years, he transmitted the teachings of the Primordial Dao but found them incomplete, so he diligently sought instruction, traveling far and wide.\n\nIn the second year of the Xining reign of the Song (1069), while traveling in Shu, he encountered Liu Haichan, who bestowed upon him the secrets of the Golden Elixir, the Reverted Cinnabar, and the firing times. He then changed his name to Yongcheng, styled himself Pingshu, and took the sobriquet Ziyang.\n\nOnce, there was a monk who cultivated the precepts, concentration, and wisdom, capable of entering samadhi and projecting his spirit. He could traverse hundreds of miles in an instant, and his aspirations aligned closely with Ziyang’s. One day, Ziyang asked, “Master, would you be willing to journey afar today?”\n\nThe monk replied, “I would gladly accompany you to Yangzhou to see the jade-flower.”\n\nZiyang and the monk then sat in a quiet chamber, facing each other with closed eyes in meditation, projecting their spirits. When Ziyang arrived, the monk had already circled the flower three times. Ziyang said, “Pluck one as a keepsake.” Moments later, they stretched and awoke.\n\nZiyang asked, “Master, where is the jade-flower?”\n\nThe monk’s hands were empty. Ziyang then produced the jade-flower and placed it in the monk’s palm.\n\nHis disciples later asked, “You both traveled in spirit—why was there a difference between presence and absence?”\n\nZiyang replied, “My path of the Golden Elixir unites cultivation of both nature and life. Thus, when gathered, it takes form; when dispersed, it becomes qi. Wherever it goes, the true spirit manifests visibly—this is called the yang spirit. His cultivation, however, sought quick results, neglecting the refinement of life and focusing solely on the nature principle. Thus, where he goes, no form or shadow remains—this is called the yin spirit. The yin spirit cannot move objects.”\n\nDuring the Zhiping reign of Emperor Yingzong, he visited Ma Mo of Fufeng, styled Chuhou, in Hedong. He presented his work, *The Awakening to Reality*, saying, “All I have learned in my life is contained herein. I hope you will circulate this book—there may be those who grasp its meaning through reading.”\n\nIn the summer of the fifth year of the Yuanfeng reign (1082), he sat in meditation and passed away, having lived ninety-nine years. When his disciples cremated his body, they recovered hundreds of relics, the largest like lotus seeds, all shimmering in golden-green hues. Those who recognized them said, “This is what the Daoist texts call *relics radiant as golden jade*.”\n\nSeven years later, Liu Fengzhen encountered Ziyang on Mount Wangwu. He left behind a poem and departed.\n\n---\n\n**Li Bití**\n\nDuring the early Shaosheng reign of the Song, Liu Yanzhong resided in Xiuzhou. A Daoist once visited his door, and when someone asked for medicine, the Daoist would mix his nasal mucus with grime to form pills, which instantly cured illnesses. Thus, he styled himself Li Bití.\n\nYanzhong invited him to sit and said, “Today, I have no wine to offer as courtesy.”\n\nThe Daoist laughed and replied, “There is a jug of *Pearl Spring* beneath your bed—why not bring it out to entertain your guest?”",

When people sought his help for ailments, Ma used no medicine—only striking the afflicted spot with his bamboo staff, or pointing at it while blowing on the staff’s tip to produce a thunderous roar, and the illness would vanish. If offered silk in gratitude, he firmly declined. If pressed, he would distribute it among the poor.",

      "translated_text": "Liu was greatly ashamed and called for a servant to fetch the jug. The Daoist said, “No need to fetch it—just bring the empty jug.” When the jug arrived, he asked for paper to cover it. After a moment, fragrance spilled outward, and it had become fine wine. All who sat there became drunk.\n\nThe next day, Liu had other guests and brought out what he had called *Pearl Spring*, but the jug held not a single drop. One day, the Daoist visited Liu to take his leave, saying, “Twenty years from now, on such-and-such a month and day, we shall meet again in Zhenzhou.” When the appointed time came, Liu died in Zhenzhou.\n\n**Guīyuánzǐ**\nErzhu Dong, styled Weitong, encountered an extraordinary person in his youth who transmitted to him the Dao of returning to the origin and embracing the One. Thus, he styled himself Guīyuánzǐ. Initially, he lived in seclusion on Mount Peng, later selling medicines in the Shu and Han regions, moving as swiftly as if he were flying. Innkeepers would often hear strange sounds in his room at night. Peering in, they saw his body rise from the bed and stop only when it touched the roof beam.\n\nOnce, someone found an object like a sparrow’s egg among dry bones. When they showed it to Dong, he said, “This person consumed divine elixir but failed to cultivate and refine it. Thus, pure yin consumed him entirely, leaving no yang to sustain life. Only the elixir in his cinnabar field congealed into this.”\n\nAt the end of the Tang, when Wang Jian besieged Chengdu, Dong was also in the city. The siege dragged on, and Wang vowed that on the day the city fell, he would slaughter all without exception. Dong then spread out a mat and performed a ritual. He summoned Wang and his entire army, and they were all seized by divine beings riding black clouds, who rebuked Wang, saying, “Dare you bring calamity upon my people? The calamity shall rebound upon you.” Terrified, Wang and his men prostrated themselves. Later, when they entered Chengdu, Wang ordered his troops not to kill, and the people went about their business as usual.\n\nDong sold his elixirs, each pill demanding twelve thousand coins. Once, a certain prefect wished to buy one. Dong said, “The prefect has much gold—it will cost one hundred and twenty thousand.” The prefect, deeming his words deceptive and seditious, ordered him placed in a bamboo cage and sunk into the river.\n\nAt Fuling, upstream, two fishermen were casting their nets when they hauled up the cage—inside was Dong. The fishermen said, “This must be an extraordinary person in meditation.” They struck a bronze bowl to rouse him. After a moment, Dong opened his eyes and asked, “How far is it from here to Tongliang? Is there a place called Sandu?” The fishermen replied, “We are from Baishi River. Tongliang is four hundred *li* from here, and to the east lies Fengdu County, where the immortal’s abode of Pingdu Mountain and Xiandu Temple stands.” Dong said, “My master told me that when I encountered Sandu and Baishi floating on water, I would ascend as an immortal—this must be the place.”\n\nAfter stepping ashore, Dong said to the two fishermen, “I see that you both seem to be men of the Dao. Have you received any transmission?” The two replied, “We once followed an immortal from the sea and received the essence of the Three Ones. We have cultivated yang and refined yin for many years.” Dong then asked for wine, and they drank deeply. He took out his elixir and shared it with them. In a lychee grove, the three of them ascended on clouds and departed.\n\n**Bái Yùchán**\nGe Changgeng, a native of Qiong in the Song, was named Báiyùchán by his mother in fulfillment of a dream. At twenty-two, he sat for the child examination. Later, he lived in seclusion on Mount Wuyi, styling himself Shūqióngzǐ, and studied under Chen Cuixu. After nine years, he finally attained the Dao.

      "translated_text": "Profoundly versed in Confucian classics, his words flowed as effortless compositions. He once composed a self-eulogy:\n\n*\"Through the ages, disheveled hair and bare feet,\nA lifetime of absorbing qi and dining on rosy clouds.\nLaughing, I point to the foothills of Mount Wuyi—\nDeep within the white clouds lies my home.\"*\n\nHe constantly wore a thunder talisman at his elbow, and his prayers for blessings or exorcisms always met with extraordinary responses. His prognostications of fortune and misfortune startled and awakened the common folk. Once, while traveling in the capital and boating on the West Lake at dusk, he fell into the water. The boatman searched in alarm but found no trace, yet by dawn, Bái Yùchán was still afloat on the water, seemingly intoxicated. Another time, a man wielding a knife pursued and threatened him. Yùchán rebuked the assailant, and the knife clattered to the ground as the man fled. Yùchán called out to him, *\"Come back, do not fear,\"* and returned the knife. People marveled that he emerged from water unstained and remained unharmed by weapons.\n\nDuring the Jiading era of the Song, an imperial decree summoned him to court. His audience with the emperor was deemed satisfactory, and he was appointed to reside at the Taiyi Palace. One day, he vanished without a trace. Thereafter, he roamed famous mountains, his divine wonders beyond comprehension.\n\n**Chén Níwán**\nChén Nán, styled Nánmù and known as Cuìxū, was a native of Boluo. He made a living by weaving bamboo utensils before receiving the *Taiyi Daogui* alchemical method from the Venerable Master of Piling. He obtained the *Jingxiao Dalei Langshu* from a divine being on Mount Limu. Skilled in healing illnesses by kneading earth into talismans, people called him *Chén Níwán* (\"Chen of the Mud Pill\").\n\nOften barefoot and traveling four or five hundred *li* a day, his tattered garments were patched like a quail’s plumage, his body caked in dust and grime. He relished meat and drank to intoxication all day. Once, in Cangwu, he was summoned to pray for rain during a drought. Cuìxū brandished an iron whip and descended into a deep pool to drive out the dragon. In an instant, thunder and rain erupted. Passing through Sanshan, he encountered a raging torrent at Dayi Crossing where no boats dared to sail. Cuìxū floated across on his bamboo hat. While traveling on the Qin Pass road, bandits ambushed and stabbed him. He lay unconscious for three days before the bandits dispersed, and he revived. In Changsha, he was seized by Marshal Chong and sent to prison in Yongzhou, yet within a few nights, he reappeared in Changsha.\n\nAt midnight, he would sit and hold mercury in his mouth, which by the next day transformed into silver. He transmitted his alchemical methods to Bái Yùchán. During the Jiading era of Emperor Ningzong, he entered the waters of Zhangzhou and departed.\n\n**Mò Yuèdǐng**\nMò Yuèdǐng, whose personal name was Dòngyī and courtesy name Qǐyán, was a native of Huzhou. Born with an elegant bearing, his skin was as fair as jade and snow, and his eyes shone with a piercing light. He entered the Zhangren Temple on Mount Qingcheng, where he met Xú Wújí and received the *Five Thunder* method. Thereafter, Yuèdǐng styled himself *Master of Thunder*, commanding spirits and demons, his actions in harmony with the heavens. Whether laughing, jesting, or raging, it seemed as though divine beings followed him.\n\nEmperor Shizu of the Yuan summoned him for an audience. The sky was clear and bright when the emperor asked, *\"Can you summon thunder?\"* Yuèdǐng replied, *\"I can.\"* He took a walnut and cast it to the ground. Thunder roared in response, and the emperor’s expression changed. When ordered to summon rain, it arrived at once. The emperor was overjoyed and bestowed gold and silk upon him. Yuèdǐng tore them to pieces and distributed them to the poor.\n\nHe loved wine and was never without it. When drunk, he would roll his eyes toward the sky, and a chill wind would suddenly rise from his sleeves. Once, while drinking with guests on a boat on the West Lake under a scorching sun, a guest asked for a wisp of cloud to shade them. Yuèdǐng laughed, picked up a fruit rind, and floated it on his wine cup. A cloud arose from the lakeside and cast its shadow over the sun.\n\nAt Fanli Temple, during a Mid-Autumn gathering, clouds obscured the moon for a long time. Yuèdǐng happened to be at the temple, and the Daoists, knowing his powers, hastily invited him to join the feast. With a gesture of his hand, the clouds dispersed as if washed away. A pastry vendor’s basket of cakes was repeatedly stolen by a spirit. Yuèdǐng summoned thunder to strike the clouds, and the severed head of the fox spirit fell in the marketplace.\n\nA man’s bride was abducted en route by a white fox spirit, leaving only an empty carriage at the door. Yuèdǐng performed the *Yubu* step as if directing something. A sudden gale arose, and the woman was blown back to her home. She exclaimed, *\"I was just on North High Peak—how did I end up here?\"*\n\nAt seventy-three, he told his disciple Wáng Jìhuá, *\"Next year, on the thirteenth day of the first month, I will depart at your home.\"* When the day arrived, wind, thunder, rain, and lightning raged. He asked for a brush and wrote a farewell poem. Upon finishing, he passed away peacefully, his face glowing like cinnabar.\n\n**Mǎ Dānyáng**\nMǎ Dānyáng, a native of Ninghai, was the husband of the immortal Sun Xiangu and styled himself *Dānyángzǐ*. When his mother was pregnant, she dreamed of Mágū bestowing a cinnabar pill upon her, which she swallowed. She awoke to a wondrous sensation, and the year was the fifth of the Tianhui era under Emperor Taizong of Jin.\n\nAs a child, he often recited poems about riding clouds and cranes. Lǐ Wúmèng saw him and marveled, *\"Your forehead bears the mark of three mountains, and your hands hang past your knees—truly the material of a great immortal.\"* Sun Jun gave his daughter to him in marriage, and they had three sons. He once wrote a poem:\n\n*\"Embracing the One and guarding unity—this is the work,\nThe lazy man of today is one with the void.\nAll day, I hold my cup to roam my spirit,\nDrunk, yet there is someone to support me.\"*\n\nNo one understood its meaning. One day, Master Wang Chongyang of Zhongnan came to visit, saying, *\"We have a predestined bond from past lives.\"* After eating a melon, he began from the stem. Dānyáng asked why, and he replied, *\"Sweetness comes from bitterness.\"* When asked where he came from, Chongyang said, *\"I have traveled a thousand *li* just to support a drunkard.\"* Dānyáng pondered this and found it aligned with his earlier poem. Astonished, he became his disciple.\n\nChongyang wished to travel west, but Dānyáng could not immediately abandon his family and business. Chongyang admonished him in many ways, and Dānyáng’s resolve finally wavered. He entrusted his wealth to his three sons and followed Chongyang to reside in the misty caves of Kunlun. Sun Xiangu remained at home, establishing a hermitage where she cultivated the Dao for over twenty years.\n\nOne day, Dānyáng told his disciples, *\"Today, there will be an unexpected joy.\"* He sang and danced in delight. Suddenly, celestial music filled the air, and looking up, he saw Xiangu riding a cloud, accompanied by immortal youths, jade maidens, banners, and regalia. She leaned down and said to Dānyáng, *\"I will return first to Penglai Island to await you.\"*",

That same night, he knocked at the wine steward Guò Fùzhōng’s gate, borrowed a brush, and wrote this ode:\n\n*At sixty-one, his years were spent,\nUnknown to all in this world’s rent.\nA thunderous roar—one mighty cry—\nAnd vast, he rides the winds on high.*\n\nThen he said to those around him, *\"The Master has already departed.\"* Only then did they realize that what they had seen were manifestations of his yang spirit.\n\n---\n\n**Zhāng Sānfēng**\nZhāng Sānfēng, a native of Yìzhōu in Liáodōng, was named Jūbǎo and styled Xuánxuán. From birth, he emitted a rare fragrance, with the form of a tortoise and the bones of a crane. He stood seven feet tall, his beard and whiskers bristling like halberds, his topknot bound in a single coil. He carried a blade and a ruler, wore a single straw hat and a single sleeve, enduring both cold and heat without adornment. People called him *\"Zhang the Unkempt.\"* He could travel a thousand *li* in a day, and when still, he would close his eyes in meditation. Though he might consume a *dǒu* or *shēng* of food in ten days, he could also fast for months without discomfort.\n\nAt the end of the Yuán dynasty, he resided at Jīntái Temple in Bǎojī, where he left behind an ode before departing the world. The monk Yáng Zhǎnshān prepared his coffin and sealed it, but when they opened it to confirm, he had revived. He then journeyed into Shǔ. In the early Hóngwǔ era, he arrived at Tàihé Mountain to cultivate the Dao, building a hermitage near Yùxū Palace. Before the hermitage stood five ancient trees, beneath which he often rested.",

Suddenly, celestial music filled the air, and looking up, he saw Xiangu riding a cloud, accompanied by immortal youths, jade maidens, banners, and regalia. She leaned down and said to Dānyáng, *\"I will return first to Penglai Island to await you.\"*",
