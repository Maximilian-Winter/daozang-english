  "full_translation": "*The True Instructions*\n*Scroll One*\n*Chapter One: The Movement of Symbols*\n\n**Poem of Erlü Hua**\n\nThe sacred peaks thrust through the clouds,\nTowering summits rise a thousand fathoms high.\nThe numinous valley lies vast and still,\nJade groves flourish in solemn verdure.\n*(One character here is heavily inked and unrecognizable. A stroke extends downward from its center, resembling the character \"羊\" [sheep]. The person’s name is Quan.)*\n\nBorn with beauty and grace,\nIn youth, his voice flowed with pure resonance.\nHis spirit dwelled by the ford of庄慧,\nTranscending form in the forest of Wei.\nRadiant within the vermilion gates,\nYet his heart soared beyond the common world.\nI share with the Master’s clan\nA lineage deep as the same abyssal pool.\nThe great ancestral legacy diverged,\nAnd now we branch along separate paths.\nLike gold and orchid bound by fondness,\nThe Three Friendships grow ever more profound.\nIn quiet reflection, I rejoice in this meeting,\nOur refined discourse spanning the years.\nWho says the hidden mirror is hard to find?\nIt lies within the square inch of the heart.\nI lift my thoughts beyond the earthen enclosures,\nTogether we are scholars of the mountain crags.\nLet not your soaring brush take flight,\nOnly to be swept away by the startled wind.\nThough transformation depends on man,\nThe flourishing ram is not easily compared.\nWhat I seek is no fleeting blossom—\nIn the twilight of years, it is you, my friend.\n\n**Erlü Hua** claims to be a person of the Southern Mountains, though it is unclear which range. She appears as a woman of about twenty, clad in dark green robes above and below, her countenance surpassingly fair.\n\nOn the night of the tenth day of the eleventh month in the third year of the Shengping era, she descended. (Two characters here are cut off; they should be \"Yang Quan.\") From then on, she came and went, visiting as many as six times in a single month. She stated her original surname (one character is cut off; it should be \"Yang\") and presented (this character was originally \"Quan,\" later altered) a poem, along with a fire-washed cloth handkerchief, a gold *tiaotuo*, and a jade *tiaotuo*. The *tiaotuo* were exceptionally large and exquisitely crafted. The divine woman said (this character was originally written as \"Quan\" in cursive, later changed to \"see,\" with the stroke order adjusted): \"Sir, be careful not to reveal my presence. If you do, both of us will incur guilt.\" Upon inquiring, this person was said to be Luo Yu, a woman who attained the Dao in the Nine Doubt Mountains. In a past life, she had been poisoned to death by her master’s wife while serving as a wet nurse. As her previous sins had not been absolved in the Dark Realm, she was sent down to this foul and turbid world to atone for her transgressions. She gave (this \"Quan\" is also in cursive, resembling the previous form but not identical) the elixir for *shijie* to Yang Quan. Now, she resides in the mountains east of the Xiang River. (Originally, a small section was missing here.) This woman is already nine hundred years old.\n\n(Investigating this, it should be the descent to Yang Quan. Quan, styled Daoyu, was the youngest son of Yang Zhen. Later, he became the Yellow Gate Attendant for Emperor Jianwen of the Jin. He was also the grandfather of Yang Xin, who likewise practiced Daoist arts and ingested elixirs. This account was written by a certain Yang, likely because they shared the same surname, and thus inquired as if it were Yang Quan, recording the matter in detail in response.)\n\nIn the third year of Shengping (a *jiwei* year), six years before *yichou*, none of the Perfected had yet descended.\n\n---\n\nThe above three entries were hastily written by Yang on paper. The Lady of Southern Peak spoke to her disciple, recording the details as follows. (The disciple refers to Yang herself. This gathering of the Perfected seems to have taken place in the Grotto Palace, which is why the Director of Destinies is listed first, serving as the host. The Lady explained the ranks and titles to Yang in this manner, not during the descent to Yang.)\n\nThe Perfected Lord Director of Destinies of the Eastern Peak,\nThe Perfected Lord of the Nine Essences of the Eastern Palace, Grand Minister of the Golden Portal, the Great Lord Green Lad,\nThe Right Immortal Duke of Penglai, Jia Bao’an (a native of Zheng; from here onward, all are referred to by the *zi* of the Perfected, not their given names, with their clans and lineages also found in secular Daoist texts and records),\nThe Celestial King of Qingxu Xiaoyou, Wang Zideng (as the Green Lad holds a lofty and revered position, his given name is not dared to be mentioned; this Qingxu is the master of the Southern Peak, yet his *zi* is still used. The *zi* of the Director of Destinies of Mao Mountain is uniquely not recorded, which is difficult to explain),\nThe Perfected of Tongbai, Right Assistant Wang, Director of the Five Peaks, Attendant to the Lord of Dawn, Wang Ziqiao,\nThe Perfected of the Green Canopy, Attendant to the Lord of Dawn, Guo Shigan (a native of Wei),\nThe Perfected of Rong Mountain, Right Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate, Fan Bohua (a native of You),\nThe Perfected of Shaoshi, Gentleman of the Northern Terrace, Liu Qianshou (a native of Pei),\nThe Perfected of {Mountain} Zhong, Gentleman of the Left Prohibition, Wang Daoning (a native of Changshan),\nThe Perfected of Daliang, Wei Xianren (a native of Changle),\nThe Perfected of Min Mountain, Yin Youzong,\nThe Perfected of Luhun, Supervisor of the Supreme Ultimate of the West, Guo Youdu,\nThe Marquis of Nine Doubt Mountain, Zhang Shanggui (a native of Chu).\n\nThe Divine Marquis of Mount Tai, Overseer of the Netherworld {Right Prohibition Bureau}, Bao Yuanjie (a native of Donghai),\nThe Immortal Earl of Mount Hua, Qin Shuyin (a native of Fengyi),\nThe Perfected of Geyan, Zhou Jitong,\nThe Perfected of Yangluo, Overseer of the Western Return Transmission, Chunyu Taixuan (a native of the Western Regions),\nThe True Earl of Mount Qian, Zhao Zuyang (a native of Jun),\nThe Perfected of Mount Juqu, Recorder of the Right Prohibition Bureau, Mao Jiwei,\nThe Perfected of Mount Yuque, Pei Xuanren,\nThe Immortal Capital of Baishui, Zhu Jiaofu,\nThe Three Offices’ Life-Preservation Bureau, Mao Sihe,\nThe Perfected of Great Harmony, Shan Shiyuan.\n\nThe twenty-three Perfected sat in order,\nbeginning from the west and proceeding eastward in a south-facing arrangement.\n(According to ritual propriety, the west should be the honored position when facing south,\nand the female Perfected should then proceed eastward—thus, they ought to begin from the south.\nThe present reversal to the north is likely due to the proximity of the exalted Perfected.)\n\nThe Perfected Consort of Great Harmony, Left Lady of the Supreme Realms,\nThe Lady of the Six Subtleties of the Northern Sea, Mystic Clarity,\nThe Lady of the Seven Spirits of Northern Han, Right Lady,\nThe Right Lady of the Central Flower of the Supreme Ultimate,\nThe Lady Wang of the Left Palace of Purple Tenuity,\nThe Right Lady Ying of Canglang’s Cloudy Forest.\n(Note: Lady Ying is the elder sister of the Purple Tenuity Lady,\nyet here she appears afterward—this reflects the rise and fall of their respective positions.)\n\nThe Perfected Controller of Destiny, Lady of the Southern Marchmount,\n(This is Lady Wei; as she speaks for herself, her surname is not given.)\nThe Dao-Mother of the Eight Spirits, Lady Jiang of the Western Marchmount,\n(Note: Where multiple titles exist, the greater number is deemed higher. The Queen Mother of the West is called the Nine Spirits, so the Eight Spirits should precede the Seven Spirits. Yet here they appear afterward—this remains unexplained. Also, in the *Recitation of the Yellow Court* tradition, she is called Lady Jiang of the Northern Marchmount, differing from the present text.)\nThe Perfected Guardian of the Eastern Palace, Lady Wei,\nLady Li of Bright Spirit Terrace on Fangzhang,\nThe Pacifying Consort of Nine Flowers in the Upper Palace of Purple Clarity,\nLady Guan, Noble Concubine of the Northern Absolute Terrace on Vermilion Mound,\nThe Perfected Lady of the Northern Marchmount,\nLady of the Western Han,\nLady Du of Changling.\nThe fifteen female Perfected, facing east, seated from north to south.\n(Though the month and day of this event are unrecorded, and the year unknown, as these are the names and ranks of the assembled Perfected, they are listed here at the fore. Regarding the ranks of the Perfected: as previously noted, the higher the number, the greater the honor—much like honorary titles in the present age.)\n\nOn the night of the twenty-first day of the sixth month, the Registrar of Destinies inquired, saying, \"What path does Director Xu seek in his pursuit of the Dao?\"\nDeng replied with earnest devotion to the cultivation of true sincerity.\nThe Registrar of Destinies then said, \"Formerly, there was Zhao Shutai and Wang Shiqing, who also spoke of their diligent study, yet ultimately failed to meet expectations. They were thus summoned into the service of the Northern Bright Lord’s Palace.\"\n(This occurred in the sixth month of the yichou year.)\n\nFrom this point onward, only the Registrar of Destinies’ transmission on the fifteenth day of the sixth month—a response to Director Xu’s letter discussing matters of Mount Mao—is recorded. Prior to this, there was another transmission, the date of which is not noted, both of which are contained in the fourth scroll. No earlier records exist before these.\n\nThe Northern Bright Lord’s Palace (the central administrative office of the celestial bureaus) once roamed the expanses of Heavenly Ford and gathered blossoms on Crimson Mound. At that time, its radiant presence stirred the sleeves of the numinous, and its dust-mantled splendor graced the lofty pines. (This refers to the initial descent upon the Huaqiao immortal.) From the resplendent peaks, its lofty discourse reached the distant clouds. It deemed itself stirred by the resonance of the mysterious, believing no path would remain obstructed. Bathed in the waves of the numinous, it truly hoped to share its glory with all things. Yet, unable to fully unfold its flourishing enterprise or wander freely among the peaks, it came to realize that in the moment of awakening, the response of the mysterious was minimal. Thus, it turned its carriage and returned, resting in stillness upon the kudzu terrace.\n\nFor the blade of the mysterious makes no partial distinctions, and the mirror of flowing insight eludes the untrue. If one assumes that a single ascent to the cloud-walled heights suffices, or that solitary strides alone achieve parity, then even the most humble beginnings may be cleansed, and every movement may subtly align with the hidden and the recondite. Only then will we all share in joy and sighs alike.\n\nIn the past, I saw that your intentions were deeply aligned with mine. The closing of your letter states: *\"I prostrate myself to behold the sagely record, its events profound and wondrous. The golden tally is plainly inscribed, the azure register divinely fixed. Thus, you transcend the dust of the mundane and wander freely in the Purple Yang. How pure and distant is your clarity, how exalted and rare your true nobility! Such is the mark of one who has attained the Way. I humbly request to borrow this as an analogy.\"*\n\nIt further states: *\"The steps to attaining the Dao are interwoven with the myriad spirits. To quiet the self and lodge in sincerity, to wash clean the heart and seek compassion—\"*\n\nAs such, the Dao is already near. Yet between dusk and dawn, one must diligently cultivate. Only then may the hands weave the cords of Heaven, the feet tread upon the numinous web, the heart wander the Great Void, and the eyes behold the Cavern Chambers—all without need of many days.\n\nShould the five passions stir their waves or the three souls stray in parsimony, then the Three Perfected shall dance with swords, and the Yellow Gates shall swiftly bar the way. Can one not strive? Can one not strive?\n\nOn the twenty-second day of the sixth month, at the crowing of the cock in the night, this was written in response. Such is the decree of the Purple Yang.\n\nThe two preceding passages were transcribed by the Prefectural Clerk.\n\nThe *Scripture of Treasured Spirits* as spoken by the Perfected One of Pure Numen states... (These cultivation matters are recorded in the third fascicle; they shall not be repeated here.)\n\nThe Lady of Purple Tenuity’s response is as follows... (This matter is also in the third fascicle.)\n\nIn the third year of the Xingning reign, cyclical year *yichou*, on the twenty-third day of the sixth month, in the night, this was written in response. That evening, among those who practiced the Dao, many suffered from dullness of ears and dimness of eyes. Desiring to petition for this method, they received a nocturnal visitation—this was the response they beheld. (This is Yang Jun’s personal account. The Prefectural Clerk, now past sixty, found his hearing and sight failing, hence his inquiry. Yang did not wish to name him directly, so he referred to “those among us.”)\n\nIt was further instructed: “As for Daoists whose ears are heavy...” (This matter is also in the third fascicle.)\n\nThe preceding passage is the word of the Perfected One of Pure Numen.\n\nThe Perfected One instructed: “When combing the hair, one should do so frequently.” (This matter is also in the third fascicle.)\n\nThe preceding passage is the word of the Lady of Purple Tenuity.\n\nAt the beginning of the night’s descent, just as the visitor entered the door and before taking a seat, they remarked: “This evening, the sound of waves was like thunder.” The disciple inquired as to the cause. The reply: “I had just seen the great waves of the Eastern Sea.” (Here, “disciple” refers to Yang Jun himself.)\n\nThe preceding passage is the word of the Lady of Southern Marchmount. Further instructions were given...\n\n“Do you loathe blood?”\nThe reply: “I truly loathe it.”\n“Blood lies upon the path. If you loathe it, how then can you walk?”\nAnother reply: “One should simply avoid it.”\nFurther instruction: “Avoiding it is well, yet still better is not to see it at all.”\nThe preceding passage is the word of the Lady of Southern Marchmount. From this point onward, the various Perfected Ones conversed together.\n\nIt was also said: “The *Scripture of Treasured Spirits* is the text from Master Pei Qingling’s brocade satchel, which his attendants always carried. Pei formerly received this scripture from the Lady of Purple Tenuity. I, too, possess a copy, transcribed exactly as the definitive edition kept in the Western Palace.”\nAsked where the Western Palace lay, the answer came: “It is the terrace above the western jasper of the Northern Altar in the Dark Garden.”\nAll the sacred writings of the Heavenly Perfected are stored therein.\nThe preceding passage is the word of the Lady of Southern Marchmount.\n\nMaster Pei the Perfected further stated: “This scripture ranks with the *Hidden Writings*. Its matters are essential and may be put to immediate use. Another name for it is the *Sevenfold Mysteries of the Hidden Writings*.”\n(Here ends the transmission of the twenty-third day.)\n\nThe Lady of Southern Marchmount further instructed:\n“The Lady of the Left of Purple Tenuity is named Wang Qing’e, styled Yu’yi. She is the twenty-first daughter of the Celestial Matriarch and presides over Feathered Wilds and the Dark Mound Mountain. She oversees the instruction of those destined to become Perfected Ones.”\nThe preceding passage was transmitted the evening prior.\n(This passage was received on the night of the twenty-second, the same evening as the instruction from Purple Yang. It was later noted that a great response was to follow, and the phrase “qi descending” also refers to this evening. Yang later recalled this matter and recorded it again under the twelfth day’s entry. Hence it is said to precede this evening.)\n\nFrom Qingling, twelve passages in all were received, transcribed by the Senior Scribe.\nOn the night of the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, the Lady Wang of Purple Tenuity descended. Upon alighting, she was asked:\n“When the Perfected Ones descend in person among the dust and defilement of mortals, yet their hands and feet have never once set brush to writing—is this not a matter of humble or exalted traces {or advancing demeanor}? Ought it not be made manifest?”\nThus was the inquiry made.\n\nMay this instruction dispel my ignorance.\n\nThereupon, the Lady commanded me to be seated again. Immediately, she granted me leave to transcribe her response, saying:\n\n*(This is Master Yang’s own account of the matter, as is often the case in these records.)*\n\nThe profound and empty mystery lies beyond all paths of pursuit. Words uttered into the void find no substance to grasp. Drifting and shifting with sudden swiftness, they transform and vanish without lingering—such are these two modes, both submerged in obscurity and darkness, {or flickering in stillness}. Thus, unrestrained and without guidance, they ride the wind’s gusts {or the oars’ sweep}, moving as if aboard an empty boat.\n\nTherefore, within the real lies the void; within the void, existence; and within existence, the formless. As for the manifestation of written traces: brushstrokes take shape upon paper, patterns {or sunlight} flow into script, {and the marks appear}—yet the outer display is but the radiant flourish of the mysterious brush, while the material form serves to reveal. Silent elegance is thus confined, and form transmits through the dust and defilement.\n\nIf one were to expose the skeletal remains of things, allowing them to advance or retreat with the world, this would elevate {or jade-like} the songs of the transcendent Real, while below, it would breach the prohibitions of separation and obstruction. Such is not the way we follow, nor is it permitted by the numinous Dharma.\n\nNow let us set forth the origins of writing. When the creation of script first began, it was the time when the five colors first sprouted and the patterns of literature were fixed in form. It distinguished the intercourse of humanity and marked the division of yin and yang. Thus arose the Three Origins and Eight Convergences—the script of the myriad directions that soars through the heavens—and also the luminous chapters of the Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal. Later, in the age of the Two Sovereigns, the script of the Eight Convergences was expanded into the patterns of dragons and phoenixes. The traces of the Cloud Seal were refined to form the compliant shapes of Brahmi script. The two paths were sundered, the true and the mutable were separated, and the branches were matched to their roots, giving rise to the sixty-four kinds of writing. These were then disseminated across the thirty-six heavens and the ten directions above and below. Each took its own section and type, differing in use. Though their phonetic canons were uniform, their written traces diverged widely. Comparing and discussing them, the script of the Eight Convergences is the most authentic of writings, the progenitor of literary patterns. The Cloud Seal and Luminous Script are its root and origin, the beginning of all writing. The script of the Three Origins and Eight Convergences is now used by the august Highest Ultimate and the pure transcendents of the highest heavens. The chapters of the Cloud Seal and Luminous Script are what we now see as the characters of divine talismanic writing.\n\nYet in the later flourishing age, false and chaotic inventions arose. Together they crafted clever but trivial forms, pursuing shortcuts in inferior script. All were but flowing corpses of defiled literature and licentious, perverse characters—abandoning the root to imitate the false, mere clamorous and filthy dead traces. Why would a true transcendental being discard the authentic and essential script to draw with their own hand the licentious and disordered characters of the lower realms? One who has attained the rank of true person has mastered the real in every matter. How could they alone indulge in the trivial arts of the vulgar, the corrupt practices of superficiality, clinging to them without change and delighting in them without transformation?\n\nWhen a person is in the world, those who were first skilled in writing and adept in affairs—once they attain true transcendence—will find that even the transformations of external script naturally reverse themselves along with their person. Those whose true affairs are all near at hand no longer discard the defiled script they have already mastered; rather, they first receive instruction in the superior script and only afterward come to know the true writing anew. The way of ghosts is likewise, though their characters may slightly deviate.\n\nMoreover, with the numinous brush and true hand, they dare not descend to commune with fleshly beings. Even when there are those who have attained the Dao but whose bodies have not yet transcended the world, they still dare not lower their hands to display inked characters, revealing them in written traces. As for talismanic texts and divine verses—those sought and worn—they have been crafted from the very beginning. The reason for this is that worldly people fundamentally cannot fathom their origins, and it also prevents us from concealing anything. In the unseen realm, they are mutually understood; within and without, they are reciprocally connected.\n\nFurthermore, the luminous statutes of the Four Poles and the prohibitions of the Most High are weighty, and they naturally do not permit us to again produce ordinary script for the world. Since I have already set my hand to this, and you surely do not comprehend, why would we pursue both paths and invite superfluous trouble? This, too, should be discerned in silence as to its propriety—it is hardly worth reproach. I imagine it may slightly ease the congestion in your heart, fully distinguishing you from those who do not write of themselves.\n\nThe Supreme Perfected Controller of Destinies, the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, transmitted this command as follows:\n\nWhen one casts the cloud-wheel aloft, reins in the vast emptiness, hands guiding the celestial net, feet ascending the Jade Court, body rising to the imperial palace, parting the jeweled canopy of azure—above, discoursing on the transcendent measures of the Nine Mysteries; below, recording the great life of the myriad kalpas—then one startles the lightning of radiance into solemnity, and a thousand rosy clouds blaze with brilliance. True words surge like dark waves; lofty discourse resounds in the Jade Clarity. Crimson lips unleash flowing splendor; the sun’s qi scatters in droplets. Then one exhales beacons to repel smoke, strikes gold to play jade, where luan-bird songs bloom in radiance and phoenix chants resound in fine harmony.\n\nYet if one merely descends in response to the scene, turning back to the dust of the mortal realm, riding in a tattered carriage through the morning market, coming to perfect true talent and instructing my disciples—then jade chimes fall in muted resonance, and jasper bells are inwardly restrained. The eyes survey the Five Defilements; the heart contracts in the chamber of transgressions. The spirit labors amidst foul stench; the nose fills and the breath is held. Thus, the orchid tones of the Central Prime are sealed, and one retreats to strike the golden sounds, faint and faltering, to be heard.\n\nThe words of the divine are subtle when near, yet they reach across ten thousand leagues. Though rare melodies may touch the ear, the mirror of reflection remains unobstructed. Thus, once the principles of the true are distinguished, hearing from afar, the Dao ascends in lofty progression. Unpolished jade does not display its luster, yet it may still give rise to base and trivial perceptions.\n\nNow you have arrived at the utmost of awakened intention, yet you entertain thoughts of suspicion and resemblance. Externally, you observe the responses of the vulgar; internally, you harbor hesitations and realizations. If you do not act in accord with what is fitting, you have already gone astray. What you should aspire to is the Dao; what you should ponder and chant is the wondrous. Once the Dao and the wondrous are attained, the sounds of high and low will surely become level.\n\nThis is not a matter for deliberation. You, my disciple, should apply the deepest consideration, dispersing these thoughts. Be cautious in this.\n\nThe three clauses above were written by Yang. On the night of the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, the Lady of the Southern Marchmount bestowed this command. Previously, on the evening of the twenty-second day, there was a discussion on the Dao in a separate chamber. The Ladies of the Purple Tenuity and the Southern Marchmount spoke in voices and tones markedly inferior, their intent incomprehensible.\n\nHerewith this writing is bestowed in answer to the doubts arising from our shared discourse. When first it was given, my countenance and qi remained unsettled. Only after the transmission was complete did I, the disciple, perceive that my complexion alone bore disquiet—nothing else could be spoken of. (This passage is also recorded by Master Yang as his own account.)\n\nThat evening, the Lady of the Southern Marchmount addressed me, saying: \"Tomorrow I shall journey to the Qingxu Palace on Mount Wangwu. Let this be known to you as my destination.\" Later that same night, she added: \"On the western slope of Mount Tongbai by the Eastern Sea, a landslide has just collapsed some two hundred zhang.\" The Lady of Purple Tenuity, Wang, remarked: \"How could the thoughts and concerns of worldly people ever attain true clarity in every matter? Should one not simply respond to what their hearts seek?\" The Lady of the Southern Marchmount spoke in jest, intending to affirm and establish it.\n\nIn the third year of the Xingning reign, the year *yichou*, on the night of the twenty-fifth day of the sixth month—(This marks the beginning of the Lady An’s descent, recorded separately in another scroll; hence the reign year and cyclical sign are noted anew)—the Lady of Purple Tenuity, Wang, descended once more, accompanied by a divine maiden. The maiden wore a cloud-brocade robe, its upper part cinnabar-red and lower part azure, resplendent with luminous patterns. At her waist hung a green embroidered sash, from which dangled over ten small bells, their colors alternating between azure and yellow. On her left side she bore a jade pendant, similar to those worn in the mortal world, though slightly smaller. Her garments, though dark, gleamed with a radiance that illuminated the chamber, as if sunlight were reflecting upon mica.\n\nHer hair—(this should read *fazhen*, denoting lustrous black tresses)—was arranged with unparalleled precision: coiled into a topknot at the crown, with the remaining locks cascading down to her waist. Her fingers bore golden rings, and white pearls adorned her arms. She appeared to be about thirteen or fourteen years of age. Flanking her were two attendants.\n\nOne attendant wore crimson robes and carried a green-patterned satchel, in her hands a brocade pouch measuring one or two *chi* in length, containing some ten scrolls. The pouch was sealed with a white jade clasp, upon which was inscribed: *Jade Purity Divine Tiger’s Inner True Purple Primordial Cinnabar Scripture*.\n\nThe other attendant, clad in azure, bore a white casket bound with crimson cords.\n\nThe white casket resembled one made of ivory. The two attendants appeared to be about seventeen or eighteen years of age, exquisitely adorned. The goddess and her attendants bore radiant complexions, lustrous and translucent as jade, suffused with the fragrance of five incenses—like the scent of *xiangying* (a foreign incense known as \"infant fragrance\") burning.\n\nAs they entered the chamber, they followed behind the Lady of the Purple Tenuity. Once the lady had stepped inside, she announced, \"Today, a noble guest has come to visit and converse with us.\" Thereupon, I rose to my feet. The lady said, \"There is no need to stand. We shall simply sit together and exchange courtesies.\" The Lady of the Purple Tenuity sat facing south, while I, that evening, first sat beneath the dais, facing west. The goddess then joined us on the same couch, facing east. Each of us performed the greeting with our left hands. Once the courtesies were complete, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity said, \"This is the youngest daughter of the Golden Terrace Lady Li, the Supreme Perfected of the Great Void. The Supreme Perfected of the Great Void once sent her to Mount Gui to study the Dao of the Highest Clarity. After mastering the Way, she received the scriptures of the Most High and was appointed as the True Consort of the Nine Florets of the Purple Clarity Upper Palace. Thus, she was bestowed the surname An, the given name Yupin, and the style Lingxiao.\"\n\nThe Lady of the Purple Tenuity then asked me, \"Have you ever encountered such a person in the mortal world?\" I replied, \"Her divine grace and lofty refinement defy comparison.\" The lady laughed heartily and asked, \"And what of you?\" I made no further reply.\n\nThe True Consort of Purple Clarity sat for a long while without speaking. In her hand, she held three dates, their color like dried jujubes but larger in form, without pits and lacking the taste of dates—rather, they resembled the flavor of pears. She first offered one to me, then gave another to the Lady of the Purple Tenuity, keeping the last for herself. She instructed us to eat them, and once we had finished, after a short while, the True Consort asked my age and the month of my birth. I promptly answered, \"Thirty-six, born in the ninth month of the *gengyin* year.\"\n\nThe True Consort then said, \"Your teacher, the Lady of the Southern Perfection, holds authority over the Director of Destinies and possesses a Dao of sublime and perfect attainment—truly the paragon of noble virtue. I have long heard of your virtuous reputation and never imagined we would meet today to forge this joyous karmic bond. May our connection endure through the unseen workings of fate, like intertwining pine and vine.\"\n\nThereupon, I gave my name in reply, saying, \"I am mired in the dust of the vulgar world, my essence tainted by its filth. Though I aspire to rise, I am unworthy to receive such divine favor, which I have so undeservedly been granted.\"\n\nOverwhelmed with boundless joy, I could only receive her instruction to dispel my ignorance and deliver my primal spirit—this has been my deepest wish day and night.\n\nThe True Consort said, \"You must not speak with such modesty and embellishment. Such humble words are entirely inappropriate.\"\n\nAfter a long while, the True Consort addressed me again, saying, \"I wish to compose a written piece to bestow upon you. Would you transcribe my humble thoughts with your brush?\" I assented and immediately prepared the paper and ink. She then dictated the following poem to me:\n\n---\nThe cloud-gate towers into empty heights,\nJade terraces rise amid lush mist.\nThe Purple Palace rides the verdant radiance,\nThe numinous abode gleams, towering and grand.\nWithin the vermilion chambers of the jade portico,\nSupreme virtue blazes like crimson auroras.\nBending low, I sip from the cloud-vessel’s spring;\nRaising my hand, I pluck the azure blossoms.\nI bathe my feet in the Jade Celestial Pool,\nAnd strike the drum to cross the Herdboy’s River.\nThen I urge on my radiant cloud chariot,\nReining the dragon steeds along the dark slope.\nI shake my robes at the dust’s edge,\nMy cold garments tread the turbid waves.\nI vow to bind myself to the mountains and marshes,\nHard and soft in harmonious accord.\nTogether we enter the realm of dual purity,\nWhere the perfected of the Upper Realms walk the true Way.\nIn the Purple Tenuity, we meet in noble counsel,\nChanting and receiving, our blessings manifold.\n---\n\nWhen I finished writing, I presented it to her. She took it and said, \"I now bestow this upon you to express my cinnabar heart. Do not dismiss it lightly. If there is anything you do not understand, you may inquire discreetly.\"\n\nThen the Lady of the Purple Tenuity said, \"I shall also compose a written piece through you to enlighten you and demonstrate what is virtuous.\" Once more, I prepared the paper and ink. She dictated the following poem:\n\n---\nThe Two Images divide within and without,\nThe mysterious qi bears fruit in their midst.\nDark union requires no chariot—\nWhat matters is to attain the true in one’s aspirations.\nThe Southern Marchmount forges luminous gold,\nA distant gaze overturns the scripture-case’s contents.\nNoble virtue soars, illumined by rosy clouds,\nThus moving the numinous ones of the radiant heavens.\nRiding the whirlwind, they share their quilts in repose,\nTogether they grasp the crimson clouds in the sacred feast.\nAwakening, I sigh at the boundary of heaven and man—\nWithin the reckonings, karmic bonds are already set.\nThe supreme Way is truly not crooked,\nThe dust’s filth is not what should be heard.\nWith shared vision, all perceive the eternal image;\nA lofty chant becomes the cause for your sake.\n---\n\nWhen she finished, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity took the poem and read it. Afterward, she said, \"I bestow this upon you.\"\n\nToday, you are the host of my karmic bonds,\nAnd I, the guest of your chant’s intent.\nThe Lady of the Purple Tenuity added,\n\"Tomorrow, the Lady of the Southern Marchmount shall return.\nI will accompany the Perfected Consort to welcome her at the Cloud Kiln.\nIf she does not return tomorrow, it will be a matter of several days.\"\n\nAfter a long while, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity said,\n\"I depart now.\nTomorrow, I shall return with the Perfected Consort to visit you.\"\nAwakening, I stepped down from the bed, but she was nowhere to be found.\n\nThe Perfected Consort lingered briefly and said,\n\"Hidden feelings are not yet resolved,\nAnd the spirit’s resolve is not yet forgotten.\nI imagine you will compose verses together.\"\n\"Tomorrow, I shall return again.\"\nThen she took my hand and held it as she descended from the bed.\nBefore she had passed through the doorway,\nShe suddenly vanished.\n\nOn the evening of the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month,\nThe host of Perfected Ones arrived.\nThe register is as follows:\n\nLady Wang of the Purple Tenuity,\nPerfected Consort of the Nine Flowers of the Upper Palace of Purple Clarity,\nThe Lady of the Southern Marchmount, Controller of Destinies and Perfected One of the Upper Realm,\n[Your] Master—\n(All previous and subsequent instances of \"某\" refer to the same.)\n\n(All instances of \"某\" refer to the same.)\n\nThe Perfected of Purple Yang,\nThe Lord of the Central Mao,\nThe Perfected of Pure Numinosity,\nThe Lesser Lord of the Mao,\nAnd another person—\nYoung in years, of extraordinary refinement,\nWearing a lotus crown and crimson robes,\nWith white pearls sewn along the seams,\nA sword at his waist, the like of which had never been seen.\nThis person often spoke of matters concerning Mount Jinting,\nConversing with the host of Perfected Ones.\nThere were also words beyond comprehension.\nHe bowed in reverence to the Three Perfected Ladies of Purple Tenuity, Purple Clarity, and the Southern Marchmount,\nWhile with the others he spoke as equals.\nHe was said to be Wang Ziqiao, the Perfected of Mount Tongbai.\nThroughout, he did not exchange a word with [Your] Master.\n\nMoreover, when Perfected Ones first descended in earlier encounters,\nThey likewise did not immediately engage in conversation.\nEach sat for a long while.\nThen the Perfected Consort of Purple Clarity said,\n\"I wish to trouble your hand once more to record something,\nThat I may dispel lingering thoughts and forgetful words.\nWould that be acceptable?\"\n[Your] Master again folded paper and awaited instruction.\nThe Perfected Consort then slowly and softly spoke:\n\n\"I am the youngest daughter of the Primordial Lord,\nThe beloved child of Lady Li of the Great Void.\nLong ago, I first studied the Dao upon Tortoise Terrace,\nReceived jade scriptures from the Most High,\nBore the tiger register of the Purple Sovereign,\nAnd wielded the jade axe of the Heavenly Emperor.\nI received texts from the Consort of the Upper Perfected,\nThat I might wander the Jade Clarity.\nOften, I personally opened the ninefold gates of Luo,\nTrod the dark chambers with my feet,\nSoared through the numinous void,\nGazed upon the roots of the sun,\nEntered the feasts of the seven palaces,\nAnd emerged driving cloud chariots.\nI gathered the three luminaries to ascend together,\nScattered radiant clouds to fly my carriage.\n\nNot that I could not have chosen a lofty chamber,\nSought among the purple youths,\nOr found a worthy companion in the Jade Palace,\nTo pair with a transcendent spirit and form a union,\nJoining the marvelous and guiding the wondrous,\nBecoming a companion to the Imperial Lad.\nYet it was I who followed the turning of the mechanism and entrusted myself to fate,\nAnswered the reckoning of destiny,\nStooped to the dust and foam,\nDescended with the dragons,\nSummoned the hidden and sought the heroic,\nPursued those who matched my company.\n\nFrom the beginning, our karmic bond was destined,\nAnd so there was an inked pact to fix our names,\nA pristine covenant in the Jade Realm,\nA shared governance of twin blessings.\nWe journeyed side by side like wild geese,\nShared the gourd cup’s flavor,\nBound our robes with the wine-stained sash,\nAnd attended to the inner chamber’s duties.\nSuch was the treasury of true methods.\nProceeding thus, our fates were already inscribed in the unseen records,\nOur names written in the Azure Books of the Upper Prime.\nTherefore, the heart’s inclinations toward refinement or vulgarity were already equal,\nAnd the bounds of affection in the face of beauty were already set.\nHaving attained our wishes, we roamed with joy surpassing past intentions—\nWas this not the workings of nature’s spontaneity?\nThis, again, is the great principle of the two images,\nThe appointed roles of inner and outer union.\n\nTruly, it is not that I sought to alter the unchanging or return to simplicity,\nTo congeal emotions with the blade of emptiness,\nTo wield the numinous knife sevenfold,\nTo abandon the task of the Great Plain,\nTo preserve the true and open the jade,\nOr to speak of the solitary radiance of the eight voids.\nRather, it is the flourishing stillness of lofty purity,\nThe luxuriant chariot of flowing clouds,\nWhere phoenixes sing on the paths of heaven,\nDragons chant and tigers roar,\nThe celestial sovereigns of twin radiance,\nFar ascending the starry towers,\nFlying stars casting their light,\nSun and moon illuminating the body,\nMouth exhaling dark mist,\nEyes flashing lightning.\nAbove, I repose in the jade chambers,\nWandering through the Jade Clarity,\nHand grasping radiant clouds,\nFeet treading Mount Jinting.\n\nIf, from this time onward,\nAt the moment of attaining the Dao,\nShould one thoroughly exhaust both inner and outer,\nHarmonizing principle with the unyielding like metal and stone,\nEntwining affections in dual devotion,\nUniting hearts within the bed curtains—\nOr must one embrace the shared quilt and equal care,\nYet still have fleeting encounters,\nDefiling the seven spirits,\nGrieving the soul and burdening the hun and po?\n\nThis is merely my inquiry to you, O Illustrious One, regarding lineage—\nThere is no impropriety in it.\nNow, having realized our aspirations and embraced the true,\nOur hearts are as one.\nWe shall soon join our chariots in the Jade Void,\nJourney together to the Northern Mystery,\nPluck the crimson fruits in the Jade Orchard,\nGather the cinnabar blossoms in the [Gate of Goodness] Garden,\nShare the waters of the Purple River,\nBathe together on the banks of the Azure Stream.\nClad in robes of purple blossoms,\nCrowned with lotus diadems,\nWe shall wander freely in the Upper Clarity.\"\n\nTogether we shall attend the Three Primordials’ court,\nAs the Eight Radiant Ones emerge and descend.\nThrough phoenix gates and cloud-barred passes,\nWe shall gaze upward to sip the golden marrow,\nChant and sing of the jade mystery.\nDrifting in the void, we shall recline in banquet,\nHolding high assembly in the Grand Dawn.\nThe Four Equilibrants shall intone in clear song,\nFragrant Mothers shall waft incense smoke,\nAnd side by side we shall behold the paired visions.\nHand in hand, our sashes intertwined—\nIs this not joy?\nIs this not the fulfillment of our aspirations?\nO Illustrious One, may you follow the turning of fate and join the gathering,\nFor I shall surely not refuse.\nMoreover, I myself cannot turn from truth to return to darkness,\nSo long as I may follow the promptings of my heart.\n\nWhen the transmission was complete, she took the text back to examine it once more, then said:\n“Now I present this letter to you,\nThat it may dispel all lingering doubts.”\n\nHaving spoken, she laughed,\nAnd after a long while,\nThe Lady of the Purple Tenuity said:\n“The words of the Perfected Consort are now exhausted,\nAnd the bonds of affection are firmly established.\nYou can no longer entertain any hesitation.\nThe dark workings of fate and hidden allotment have made it so.”\n\nThe Lady of the Southern Marchmount, having received the letter, said:\n“Hidden destinies and numbered influences have moved in accord,\nAnd the dark workings of fate have aligned.\nBy karmic portion, you have come to be betrothed,\nNewly weaving the threads of this bond—\nA fine matter indeed for those who join in truth.\nIt is but to manifest the name of paired counterparts,\nTo define the roles within and without,\nNot to blindly follow the corrupt and defiled ways of the world,\nNor to tread the lower paths of licentious impurity.\nTo couple with a numinous consort and meet the radiant scene,\nTo be betrothed to a noble Perfected maiden—\nIn such intimate communion,\nThere is great benefit for the advancement of your practice,\nAnd no cause for fear of severance or harm.\nThe thousand spirits may now be made to witness,\nAnd no further objections may be raised.\nThe Perfected Banner shall surely be able to proceed,\nAnd the clouds shall surely be able to bear our shared chariot.”\n\n“I once before, through the Lady of the Purple Tenuity,\nConveyed this intent to you.\nNow that it has come to pass as wished,\nIt brings me even greater delight.\nTake care never again to harbor doubts in your heart.\n\nYesterday, in the Clear Void, I saw the Lady Li of the Golden Terrace,\nWho said that you still held doubts in your heart,\nThat your qi and complexion bore slight signs of hesitation—\n(She meant the characters should read *xinliang xinliang*).\nTo reject this undertaking would be no small error.\nThe Perfected Consort possesses the Inner True Cinnabar and Azure Jade Script of the Divine Tiger,\nWhich are not things that you, with your level of talent, could presume to transcribe.”\n\n“Thus, I shall not conceal it from you. Today, as we join hands, how could it be merely about literature? We shall surely ascend the jadelike heavens on the light of dawn. If there remains anything you have not yet awakened to, you ought to quietly inquire whether it is fitting.\n\nWhen the Perfected Consort saw the Lady’s letter, she laughed and said, ‘To clasp hands upon the Twin Terraces, to delight in this joyous gathering—our light and mechanism are as one, are they not?’\n\n*True Reports, Scroll the First. True Reports, Scroll the Second. The Second Chapter: “The Turning of the Celestial Symbols.”*\n\nThe Perfected of the Clear Void bestowed the text, saying:\n\nThe Way of the Yellow and Red, the method of blending qi—these are but one of the techniques Zhang Ling received to propagate his teachings, a means for planting the seed. They are not the affairs of the Perfected. I have seen many who practiced this and cut off their posterity, yet never one who cultivated it and attained life. Among millions, none escape examination and punishment. Among tens of millions, perhaps one may chance upon it, and even then, only attain a distant semblance of deathlessness. Zhang Ling transmitted this to teach the world, yet even he did not practice such transformations.\n\nTake care never to speak of these base, worldly Ways, for they corrupt the true qi of the celestial realms. To harbor lustful thoughts, to fix the mind on the observation of sensual forms, and yet claim to practice the supreme Way—this only serves to make plain the Three Bureaus’ examination and punishment. It is like embracing jade and leaping into fire, or burying a dog in a golden coffin.\n\nThe observation of sensual forms is called the Yellow and Red. The supreme Way is called the Hidden Scriptures.”\n\nThe depths of human ignorance reach such extremes. The Lady of Purple Tenuity bestowed these scriptures, saying: \"The Yellow Script and the Red Realm, though secrets of longevity, are in truth inferior techniques for attaining life—far from what the perfected immortals of the Upper Palace, who wander in the radiance of the celestial scenes, may speak of. This Way serves merely to nurture and propagate life, not the supreme Dao.\n\nThose who harbor lustful qi while attempting to practice the Hidden Scriptures only grasp the Water Bureau’s brush and sound the Three Bureaus’ drums. Even the Mysterious Stem cannot be relied upon, nor can liberation be depended upon. In short: purity invokes the descent of spirits; devotion commands the service of gods.\n\nWhen true persons pair with their luminous counterparts, what they value lies in the union of equals, their mutual love resting in the two radiant forms. Though called husband and wife, they leave no trace of conjugal acts. This is but an empty name to guide perception. Should the Yellow and Red linger in one’s heart, even true persons cannot be encountered, nor can numinous beings be approached. One toils in vain at such practices, only to labor further under the Three Bureaus’ scrutiny.\"\n\nAt the hour of the cock’s crow, the Lady of the Southern Marchmount bestowed a writ, saying: “Now that the cock has crowed, the bond of affection is deep indeed.” The Perfected of Purple Yang bestowed a writ, saying: “The Great Void stretches far and free; high and low meet as one. The meaning of embodying worthiness is made manifest in the unseen workings of fate. Guard your heart against the doubts of the Yellow and the Red.”\n\nThe Lord of Mao Peak bestowed a writ, saying: “The mysterious standard touches the luminous scene; bowing low, it harmonizes with the dust and mist. The jade chime sounds in the chamber of transgression; the pure wind soars free. Can you not be exhorted to this?” With these words, the perfected ones departed. The True Consort lingered briefly behind, saying: “I trouble you, Illustrious Lord, to compose one more verse.” And she bestowed a writ, saying:\n\n“Forget the orchid’s purity, and let your radiant heart align in perfect accord. Soon you shall frequently and reverently purify the celestial precincts, where your virtue will merge with the flowing light. It is fitting that joy arise from the principle of union. Lead the flourishing and submit to the measure. Illustrious Lord, your lofty spirit shines—cast aside stagnation and forget baseness.”\n\nWith these words, she took his hand and stepped down from the couch. Before they reached the doorway, she suddenly vanished.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month, eight perfected ones descended: the Lady of the Left of Purple Tenuity, first; the True Consort of the Nine Flowers of the Upper Clarity Palace, second; the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, Controller of Destinies and Perfected of the Upper Realms, third; the Perfected of Purple Yang, fourth; the Perfected of Pure Numinosity, fifth; the Lord of Mao Peak, sixth; the Lesser Lord of Mao, seventh; and one other, very young and poised, wearing a lotus crown and a crimson robe with a sword at her side—one never before seen. It was surmised she might be the Perfected Wang Ziqiao of Mount Tongbai. Much was discussed of matters on Mount Jinting, though many words were unintelligible.\n\nThe Perfected of Purple Tenuity and the Upper Perfected of the Nine Flowers Consort were revered. All bowed and addressed themselves as “your subordinate.”\n\nThe Upper Perfected said: “Yesterday, I went with Shushen to the Palace of Pure Emptiness to review the gains and losses of the perfected as immortals. Recently, forty-seven were abruptly removed, and only three were restored. We also reviewed the registers of your names, and all is well now. Xu is listed among the foremost ranks.” (Xu was the name of the Prefect; Yang Jun had submitted a memorial, so the name was not recorded.)\n\n“I did not initially realize it was like this—how much better it is! His diligent refinement of the heart, his devotion to principle, his heart like cinnabar and intent exhausted—he treads as though upon ice and fire. If he persists thus, even the perfected cannot escape, nor can the Dao of immortality remain hidden. He must only sever all thoughts of lust and desire, and we shall soon be able to meet. This should be made clear to him.” These were the words of the Lady of the Southern Marchmount.\n\nThe Lord of Mao Peak said: “Boju is in my charge. The Great Venerable One will surely take note. In the lands east of the Yangtze, none has been seen so devoted to the Dao. Yet do not rely on Boju’s rank and forget the Way. Falsehood is the sickness of virtue; ostentation is the calamity of the body. Stagnation is the first loss; shame is the lock of the body. Dispel these four difficulties, and only then may one inquire of the Dao.”\n\nThen the numinous chariot’s traces resounded, and the day grew faint. “If there is any thought of transgression, do not practice the Way of the Upper Perfected. Yesterday, I saw the Palace of Pure Emptiness strike these names from the rolls, and they were then subjected to examination and punishment, their fates handed over to the Three Bureaus. Can one not be cautious?”\n\nThe words to the right are those of the Lady of the Southern Marchmount: “Prefect Xu, be mindful during the year of mourning for the deceased. This is shown to the Immortal Marquis Xu thus.” (These are the words of the Lesser Lord.)\n\n(With a great laugh upon finishing her words:) \"Once the heart of stinginess is forgotten, what one gains will differ entirely. If base shame is not dispelled, one’s name shall not be inscribed in the Register of Life. Though Prefect Xu has already been {temporarily} removed, he must be repeatedly purged again and again.\" (These are the words of the Pure Numinous One.)\n\nThe Eastern Minister of Destiny knows well Prefect Xu’s reverent solemnity. The Lesser Heavenly King inquired yesterday: \"Where does this man now reside? What Dao does he cultivate?\" The Eastern Minister replied: \"He is a scholar of my native region.\" (By \"native region,\" this refers to Jurong and Mount Mao sharing the same territory—not that he is originally from Xianyang.) \"Inwardly, he is enlightened and upright; outwardly, he blends with worldly affairs. Truly a man of fine talent. Now he cultivates the Dao of the Upper Perfected.\" These words accord with human sentiment, though they bear a trace of ostentation. (These are the words of the Lady of the Southern Marchmount.)\n\nThe following is from the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month. (All twenty-four entries bear Yang’s calligraphy.)\n\nXiao {Jinmao} is a man of true talent, inwardly reflective and outwardly harmonious. Like Zeng Shen leaving the fields, his cinnabar heart shares the same boat. Like undyed silk thrice moved, he comes to shelter the square-headed. (These four lines form an acrostic composing the graph *Sixuan*—the courtesy name of the Prefect.)\n\nHis name is recorded in the Great Ultimate; in golden script, he is inscribed in the Eastern Land. Seven times he has ascended in trailing robes; rapt, he congeals in the Grotto Chamber. Once inner burdens are dissolved, both hun and po grow supple. Guard this without weariness; accumulate it without cease. The Five Difficulties dispelled, he shall be enfeoffed as a marquis. (The sevenfold ascent refers to the practice of flying paces; the Grotto Chamber, to the affairs of the Cavernous Chamber.)\n\nThe above is what the Lady of the Purple Tenuity conveyed, to be shown to Prefect Xu.\n\nThe following entry was written by the Prefect himself:\nThe Lady of the Purple Tenuity instructed: \"Unfurl the side-clouds of the flowery canopy...\" (This matter appears in the third scroll.)\n\nOn the night of the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month, this was written. The following entry bears Yang’s calligraphy:\n\nWhen accumulated essence evokes response, the myriad things all answer. If subtle sincerity is not yet complete, then the radiance of form remains imperfect. If the radiance of form is imperfect, then within the Grotto Chamber, clarity shall not be immediately attained. When I first received this method, I would always visualize it toward the northwest. Visualizing the northwest as small makes it easier to perceive. This may be clearly demonstrated thus. (The northwest is the luminous axis of Heaven and Earth, the mysterious gate of inner illumination.)\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month, this was conveyed by the Purple Yang. (On this twenty-seventh day, the host of perfected ones descended again, and the corresponding events were numerous, though none are recorded here.)\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis passage was transcribed by the Prefectural Secretary. The two lords each had six attendants. Lord Pei’s follower bore a staff adorned with green tassels, and one attendant carried an embroidered satchel. Lord Zhou’s follower bore a staff adorned with yellow tassels (without a satchel). These two passages were written in Master Jia’s own hand.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month, the Perfected Consort of Ninefold Splendor bestowed this writing, saying:\n\nWhen twin luminaries shine in response, clouds gather and the mysterious descends. The dragon flourishes in the five voids, plucking jade upon the {Gate of Goodness} Terrace. A long chant in the numinous {scarf’s silence}, the jade portals open in radiance. How distant are the affairs left behind, forever parted from the world! Crimson waves bear the rosy chariot, lightning hastens to the purple abode. Together we carry the resonance beyond purity, roaming the cloudy peaks and boundless cliffs. Is this not excellence? Is this not joy?\n\nThe sun is the fruit of the rosy clouds; the rosy clouds are the essence of the sun. You have only heard of the method for ingesting the sun’s fruit, yet have not seen or known the art of consuming the clouds’ essence. The Scripture of Cloud-Consuming is most secret, but the Way of Attracting Clouds is most easy. This is called the method of embodying life so that jade radiance and rosy clouds illumine the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe eyes are the body’s mirrors; the ears are the body’s {leaf-gates}. Gazing excessively dims the mirrors; listening too much seals the {leaf-gates}. I possess the stone for polishing mirrors and the technique for unsealing {leaf-gates}. With these, one may penetrate the myriad spirits and subtly perceive the most distant echoes. Is this acceptable?\n\nThe face is the courtyard of the spirit; the hair is the blossom of the brain. When the heart grieves, the face {scorches}; when the brain diminishes, the hair whitens. Thus the inner essence is lost, and the cinnabar fluids are depleted. I possess the Scripture of Youthful Countenance and the method for restoring whiteness. Is this acceptable?\n\nEssence is the spirit of the body; clarity is the treasure of the self. Overwork scatters essence; excessive scheming dissipates clarity. Thus old age follows the decline of qi, and senility soon arrives. I possess the Way of Nurturing Essence and the Scripture of Prolonging Clarity. Is this acceptable?\n\n---\n\nThese four Ways are the verified true chapters of the Shangqing Inner Scriptures. I now present them to you to aid and enhance your luminous illumination. Upon completion of the transmission, I shall bestow them upon you.\n\nI respectfully assented, repeatedly entreating her favor.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month, the Perfected One of Tongbai descended together with her. Again, she instructed me to transcribe, saying:\n\nThe Eight Vastnesses and Four Poles are distant, their numinous peaks remote. Marvelous words sprout forth like buds; jade-like tones resound with vibrancy. At dawn, one soars over the pure ridges; mystic qi ascends to the heavens. The body transcends the Jade Void; the heart leaves behind all hardship and peril. One abides beyond the subtlest net, congealing harmony upon the still waves. Such a person shall surely revolve through the dark Han, pervading the true courts of the immortals. The Three Primes may then be seen, and a crimson name may be established.\n\nYet if one’s heart is swept away by reckless waves, the eyes fixed upon the hues of desire—if in movement one shares the snares of the deceptive, and in stillness stirs the seeds of contention—then this is but the semblance of progress on the immortal’s path, a widening gulf from the birth of true life. You must be vigilant.\n\nWhen I finished transcribing, I received and examined the text, which was then bestowed upon me.\n\n*(The preceding was the discourse of Tongbai. On the same evening, after Lady An had completed her transmission, Tongbai next [orally imparted] his instructions—hence it is called a \"further transmission.\" Upon final review, it appeared as though it were still Lady An, thus this note is appended.)*\n\nOn the night of the thirtieth day of the sixth month.\n\nThe Nineflower Perfected Consort descended together with the Lady of the Purple Tenuity and the Lady of the Southern Marchmount. After the Perfected Consort had sat for a long while, she commanded her attendant maidens to open the brocade satchel and produce two scrolls, which she presented for transcription. Their titles are as follows:\n\n*The Esoteric Writ of the Jade Radiance and Purple Glow: An Inner Vision*\n*The Scripture of Returning to Dawn and Rejoining the Sun’s Light: The Central Mystery of the Youthful Brilliance*\n\n(These two titles should properly belong to the scriptures of the Three Origins and Eight Convergences. Since Master Yang has thoroughly mastered the true characters, they are now rendered in clerical script for clarity.)\n\nOn the night of the first day of the seventh month, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity, the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, the Nineflower Perfected Consort, Ziyang, Tongbai, the Three Perfected Ones of Pristine Emptiness, and the Second Lord of Mao descended together. After a long while, I humbly presented myself before the assembled spirits, seeking the art of securing my person, desiring to know the distinction between noble and base, the convergence of lifespan and destiny, and the fixed limits of longevity. Thereupon the Perfected Consort smiled. After a long pause, she bestowed upon me this writing, which states:\n\nThe illustrious lord possesses a nature of serene simplicity, his mind untrammeled and bright. His virtue flows like an orchid spring, his pure resonance echoes through the golden palace. Truly, he is one who treasures hidden marvels, whose inner radiance shines with the light of secluded perfection. His spirit soars through the numinous scriptures, riding the numbers to harmonize with life. His pristine power dwells in the divine garden, his cinnabar record inscribed in the Jade Purity. He ascends in mist, seizing the light, his dark drum sounding afar. He is destined to become one of the Three Excellencies, attending the Celestial Emperor at dawn, a lofty assistant to the Four Counsels, bearing the commands of the Sagely Lord. He shall govern life and sever death, reward and punish spirits, command the thousand numina, seal mountains and summon clouds. He shall oversee the harmonious qi of yin and yang and be appointed as the Lord of the Ghosts and Spirits of Wu and Yue.\n\nAs for me, I was born of the flowering essence, my destiny congealed in contemplation. I soar through the nine heavens on the wings of the void, my ethereal voice riding the whirlwind chamber. Following the turning of the Four Awakenings, I ascend the mysterious ladder in unison with the image. My purple name is recorded in the Supreme, my pure script among the Eight Effulgences. My spirit illumines the western glow, my power shines within the inner ranks. Thus, I received the scriptures and rode the qi, attaining the office of Perfected Consort.\n\nMoreover, I am to assist you in unifying the Three Huos, governing the myriad spirits, facing the North Emperor to receive your mandate, and issuing decrees to the mountains. We are also fated to join sleeves in the numinous chamber, riding the mist of the Seven Origins, gathering in the rare grove, our inner thoughts intertwined in karmic affinity. Therefore, your surname is Yang, and I am named An. I descended from the mysterious origin, while you received the scriptures in the Western Palace. From the north, you wield the luminous tally; from the east, you ride the turning axle.\n\nHolding the yak-tail banner and grasping the battle-axe, you govern the eastern marches with sole authority. The Three Offices present their tributes, the rivers and mountains reveal their sources. The Celestial Soldiers offer their martial prowess, the Four Armored Ones guard the wheels. At this time, it is truly the height of your nobility, the grand spectacle of Perfected Immortals.\n\nAmong the Three Offices, there has long been a saying:\n*\"Yang and An, Great Lords,\nStewards of the Perfected Mandate—*\nthis refers precisely to us. For twenty-eight years now, you have been the Sage Sovereign’s equal in rank. In another twenty-two years, you shall ride the dragon and mount the clouds, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. First, you will journey to the Western Palace of Supreme Purity, paying homage to the Jade Emperor of the Three Origins in the northern court. Only then will you assume your duties at the eastern chariot.\n\nThis is because your jade-like clarity illumines the Purple Tenuity, your golden tone resonates in emptiness, and you are commended by the Great Ultimate. Your profound virtue rises naturally—no longer need you toil in arduous study or traverse mountains and rivers. If you exert yourself in refinement, you will attain a slight luminous purity, though this is hardly as effortless as your present ascent.\n\nYet worldly entanglements weave distinctions of noble and base, and mortals labor through the dusty paths of gain and loss.\"\n\nIndeed, this is not something a true person should strive to manage—it is but the natural unfolding of ease and adversity, the spontaneous encounter with fortune or misfortune. When I witness your leisurely ascent, I am truly overjoyed; when I observe your setbacks, my countenance darkens with sorrow. These two emotions manifest upon my face, yet they are hardly sufficient to give rise to profound lament or enduring grief.\n\nAs for the hidden depths where kindred spirits meet, where black-haired companions share a love for the mysterious, where the light wheel of dust and mist intermingles with the forms of the worldly abode—how could I, on account of fleeting transgressions or the lowly bonds of youthful stagnation, bring shame upon the steadfast essence of one destined for transcendence? For yin and yang stand in opposition, and fortune and misfortune reverse their course. The two images being arrayed, gain and loss intertwine—these are but the paths of coming and going.\n\nNow, those who dwell in the flourishing respite of the windblown dust are often the sinful ghosts of the lower realms, the doomed essences hastening toward death. Only by abiding in uselessness amid the clamor of the world does one attain the uncarved simplicity of the true; only by embracing the ordinary within and gazing inward does one plant the root of numinous immortality. Wealth and nobility, indulgence and splendor—these are the axes and saws that break the bones, akin to the carts and boats that bear the condemned. Glory and pride, contention and the pursuit of fleeting advantage—these are but the means to invite transgression and humiliation, the weapons that sever the thread of life. They are no fine thing.\n\nThus, the lofty ones of antiquity, perceiving the difficulty of foreseeing faults and the impossibility of enjoying wealth and honor, retreated into the depths of secluded forests, dwelling in the radiance of renowned mountains. They chewed the harmonious qi, rinsed and bathed in pure streams, seeking to distance themselves from these evil traces and secure their own abundant blessings. They soared freely, preserving their pristine essence.\n\nWhy, then, should you hasten after the distinctions of noble and base in the human realm, casting yourself into the marketplace of glory and disgrace? Moreover, the days of clashing armies draw near, and the three disasters approach. Divine winds sweep away the foul, and putrid vapors rise to the heavens. Bright metal is born in filth and mire, precious jade is cast into dung to attract dust. Cold garments are shaken free of blood, impure essence depletes the true. The mysterious Dao flees far into the distance.\n\nAt such a time, if you cannot endure the smoke of wind and fire and wish to embrace your true form in secluded forests, you may seek the Way of unbuckling the sword and practice the art of bidding farewell to the world. From the moment of parting at the gathering of darkened mouths, the traces of concealment and revelation will be determined by circumstance, entrusted to the discernment of the enlightened lord. Heavenly destiny responds to profound resonance, and connections are made by fate. The numinous script on the jade terrace aligns with the true契, merging with the radiance. Thus, words are few in speech, and the heart is exhausted by the brush. How could I alone sigh for one person? This is but an example of the division of names and roles.\n\nWhen the writing was finished, she took it and gave it to so-and-so, then asked again, \"Does this bring you some relief upon reflection?\"\n\nFrom the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month onward, there were fourteen entries in all, including writings recorded by Lord Yang. At the fourth watch last night, the Eastern Minister descended for an audience. He was accompanied by seven attendants. Upon entering the chamber, one held a purple-tasseled staff, another a patterned banner, one a Ten Perfections Numinous Banner, another a green talisman satchel, three bore ivory boxes, and one grasped a flowing-gold bell. He appeared younger than his two younger brothers, who had been standing in attendance. The Eastern Minister ordered them to sit, and so they sat.\n\nAfter a long while, their conversation unfolded in detail.\n\nThe night before last, a divine maiden descended. I initially suspected she was a daughter of the Queen Mother of the West. Last night, she came again, confirming this. The Southern Perfection stated that she is the thirteenth daughter of the Queen Mother, named Wang Meilan, with the courtesy name Shenlin. She governs Mount Canglang and has received the scriptures, bearing the title \"Cloud Forest Lady.\" (These two matters were briefly recorded on the night of the fifth day of the seventh month; further details will be recounted later. Thus, the Lady of Right Radiance first descended on the evenings of the third and fourth days of the seventh month.)\n\nThe two entries above were recorded by Lord Yang.\n\nOn the night of the fourth day of the seventh month in the year *yichou*, the third year of the Xingning reign of the Jin dynasty, the Lord of Life and Eastern Minister descended. He was accompanied by seven attendants. Upon entering the chamber, one held a purple-tasseled staff, another a patterned banner, one a Ten Perfections Numinous Banner, another a green talisman satchel, and three bore white ivory boxes—within which appeared to be writings. One grasped a flowing-gold bell. All attendants wore crimson robes. The Lord of Life appeared much younger than his two younger brothers. He wore a turquoise brocade *jun* cap with a purple-fur *jinpi* lining and a hibiscus crown. His two brothers had also come, standing in attendance until he ordered them to sit, and so they sat.\n\nAfter speaking at length, on the night of the sixth day of the seventh month, the Lord of Life descended again. Following a long interval, he instructed the scribe, saying:\n\n\"If one must model oneself upon Fan Xuan, grasping the celestial patterns in purity rare among the age, then one may pluck the hidden blossoms of the deep and soar to lofty perches, tasting the resonance of supreme accord. Like still waters mirroring a mountain’s steadfast peak, the jade-like script lies desolate—yet to those who play with the treasures of the spirit, it awakens. Casting off worldly attachments, one tunes the zither of the pure and numinous, clarifying the luminous scene within emptiness. The Five Ways unfold in clarity, their hues transcending the waves of transformation. Desires merge with the insipid; emptiness unites with the obscure thoroughfare. Without sight, without hearing, one then approaches the subtle truth of the perfected. Profound awakening arises anew, inner virtue rounds into completion, and the spirit’s banner stands replete without. In the end, one may spur the clouds to ascend the heavens, inscribing the cinnabar records of the Lord of Life.\n\nYet if essence scatters amid ten thousand thoughts, life cannot be made firm. Drifting with the dust and waves, the heart fails to unite in truth—sufficient only to weary body and spirit among the crags. This would indeed mislead those who come to learn. Is the Way subtle and easy to seek, or is it arduous and difficult to attain?\n\nLet this also be shown to Attendant Xu. (These two entries were again transcribed by the Attendant.) Attendant Xu desires to dwell in the mountains. Those who honor the Dao prize freedom from perversity; those who nestle in truth find peace in tranquil joy. Profound stillness is not the host of grand compliance, nor is fiery zeal the master of instruction. Thus, one must employ the vexations of the world to comprehend the absence of them. Is this not the meaning?\n\nChange and decay—why must they follow the four seasons? Qi flows like breath; a thousand years pass like a lodging. Should Master Zhao not be concerned? One who trusts without doubt has already ripened in heart.\"\n\nThe Lord of Life spoke thus to the Lady of South Mountain: \"Those who cultivate the Way ever dwell in profound tranquility and solitude, each time settling the spirit to wander in leisure. Content in their sustenance, they find sufficiency.\"\n\nGaze not toward the tombs and enclosures—\nfor sorrow and joy thus depart forever.\nHow could misfortune and obstruction ever arrive?\n\nEach is endowed with a dwelling for the will,\neach possesses the resonance of its nature.\nHow could one tread the perverse traces of things,\nor distort one’s true vocation?\n\nWhy not indulge the utmost freedom of heaven’s standard,\nand seek the inner delight of attaining the real?\nFollow the secluded and pure to gladden the heart,\nsoothe one’s lodging to settle the mind.\nDwell on East Mountain to conceal one’s tracks,\ngrasp the mysterious hook in wondrous comprehension.\nPreserve the隨珠 to contain illumination,\nand dispel the five difficulties from the breast.\n\n---\n\nOn the night of the fifteenth day of the seventh month,\nthe Lady of Purple Tenuity bestowed a letter, saying:\n\"Those who diligently refine their essence savor the numinous standard of the mysterious.\nThose who congeal in tranquility are wrapped in the bedding of truth’s repose.\nYou have diligently cleansed your cinnabar heart,\nstriving to ascend the lofty ridge—\ntruly, this is the utmost handle of devotion to the Dao.\nYet the Dao is yielding, the real is empty;\nguard simplicity in engaging with things.\nAbide in stillness and follow your dwelling,\nand the spirit will naturally shine forth.\nIn short, haste and impatience do not exhaust principle.\nThose who oppose this only invite toil.\"\n\n---\n\nTo Xu Yufu:\n\nOn the night of the fifteenth day of the seventh month,\nthe Perfected of Pure Numinosity bestowed a poem:\n\nYearning for one who soars,\nnow moved, now fulfilled.\nMajesty does not inwardly connect;\nthe haughty woman is far banished.\nThree and four in disarray—\nentering the imperial court,\nestablishing eras and titles,\nbecoming the Great Age.\nSurely you will shine forth,\nas the four directors of the primal ministers.\nSuddenly spreading wings,\nyou ascend to the Highest Clarity.\n\n*(This is an acrostic forming the name 〈Suiyu〉.)*\n\n---\n\nTo Xu Yufu:\n\n*(On this night, the Middle Lady also bestowed a letter to Lord Xu,\nanswering his desire to know of the affairs within the Grotto-Heavens.\nThis is recorded in the fourth scroll.)*\n\nPhoenixes nest in lofty trees,\nplain robes gleam resplendent.\n*(These eight characters form the sobriquet \"Mu\" for the Long Historian.)*\n\nTread compliance and contemplate the real,\ncongeal the heart in emptiness and mystery.\n*(Taking these \"thought\" and \"mystery\"

commands clarity.\nNext practice the Dark and True,\nunharness your carriage and rest.\nYou may recite the Grotto Chapters,\nthe Jade Blade aligns with fate.\n*(These \"Jade Blade\" characters form the sobriquet \"Yu Fu\" for the Aide.\nThis matches the meaning of the *Qinglu* in external transmissions, hence \"aligns with fate.\")*\n\nFocus the heart in lofty seclusion,\nconceal your traces in quiet obscurity.\nWith unblemished vital qi,\ntake artemisia powders to dispel illness.\nThese are your proper tasks.\nNext consume *shun* rice,\nand do not neglect grains.\nThey will enrich marrow

spoken of in the *Dinglu*.)*\nThese all employ acrostics and metaphors for the four persons’ names,\neach expounding the proper affairs of cultivation, practice, and ingestion.\nTracing the intent of the words, all connect in sequence—\nyet how two persons’ speech is interwoven remains unknown.\n\nParables must be heeded;\nheedlessness is heartless.\nHow could you ride the *yan* tracks\nto seek this spirit in the void?\nSubtle tones bear profound meaning—\napply them with care, do not treat lightly.\nIn all matters, respond to the divine mechanism,\nand you shall preserve yourself to witness Great Peace.\n\nTo the right, Ying’s chant of this—\nthe *Maodinglu* speaks true admonitions.\nTake note of them.\nWith immortal talent, do not vex the heart with crooked schemes,\nand you shall attain it.\n*(Words of life-preservation.)*\n\nIn the eighth month, that person must journey east to *Xiu* {暂足} for viewing. Incense must be burned. *(Parting words on life-preservation.)*\n\nTo the right: fifteen entries in all, from the year *yichou* onward. All bear Yang’s calligraphy. I revere your refined elegance and entrust my heart to your radiance. Ashamed of my faults and dullness—my vulgarity long evident—I resolve to spur myself on, to bathe in the kiln of your cultivation. May this be the threshold of my deliverance from adversity. I humbly beseech your favor and regard.\n\nXu Xuan, prostrate with awe, bows twice. *(The Grand Scribe’s formal name is Mi, styled Sixuan. Here he is simply called Xuan—this seems inappropriate.)*\n\nPresented to Master Jia. *(This refers to the Grand Scribe’s hearing from Yang Xuanzhou of Ziyang that Jia Xuandao and others were overseeing the examination and verification of affairs. Hence this letter. Jia then submitted it to the Director of Destinies. The Director’s later response states: “Master Jia recently brought me this letter.” Yang’s account of the matter appears in the fourth scroll.)*\n\nTo the right: one entry, the Grand Scribe’s own handwritten copy. The Perfected of Taiyuan bestowed this text upon me and instructed me to transcribe it as follows.\n\nIf one seeks to advance {进貌} in this world, what matters most is the self. Those who seldom court external calamities shall never enter the realm of death. Thus did the scholars of old grasp the dark net to conceal their guiding thread, hide the gleaming mirror amid the tangle of affairs, concentrate spirit in the courts of mountain crags, and nurture the real at the ford of secluded valleys. Thereupon, they loosed their hair upon the high peaks, weaving the warp and weft of their lives. Radiant with luminous splendor, they gathered and absorbed the five numina, roamed the nine paths of the Dao, ascended the primordial to purify their forms, and cast their thoughts beyond the void. With no worldly affairs to entangle them, they sealed and stored the three qi, refined the wondrous essences—thus reversing the years of the sun’s decline and reverting to the state of infancy.\n\nYet if one’s affairs pile up like grains of sand, if carriages clog the roads, and if one’s resolve cannot be steadfastly upheld—how can the trials and verifications be brought to a halt? Things demand one another, and like breeds calamity. The gaze of Heaven and humanity does not leak with the seasons. Those who oversee reward cultivation; the trials lie in ceaseless renewal.\n\nMaster Jia recently brought me this letter, entrusting it to {亠衅且}{亠衅且}. This may be called having sentiment, yet to let slip my beam—does this not resemble deceit in reverse?\n\nOn the sixteenth day of the seventh month. *(This entry also bears a clerk’s note.)*\n\nI have reviewed your inquiry. How earnest is your heart! You gaze toward the mountain ridges, your thoughts reaching into the distance, and joyfully turn toward the Way. I have always seen this intent in you. As for those who pursue the Dao...\n\nTo attain refinement is sufficient. Yet if one has sentiment but lacks diligence, then nothing can be accomplished. Diligence without focus likewise yields no achievement. One must ensure that stingy thoughts dissolve and disperse, that defilements and afflictions scatter and vanish. *(This also resembles Dongqing’s admonition to the Senior Scribe.)* Why do you not often gaze upon the Eastern Mountains? Yearning for the Three Peaks, lingering beneath the eaves, your eyes meet the forests and waters—yet those who have departed leave little further benefit. *(Whenever the \"Three Peaks\" are mentioned, they refer to the summits of Mount Sanmao, whose peaks are called \"peaks of refinement.\")*\n\n**The Lady of Southern Marchmount to her disciples:**\nSpeech is the ruin or preservation of one’s nature and life. Trust is the hinge of gain and loss. Zhang Liang’s three appointments may be called steadfast in the Dao and enlightened in mind.\n\n**The Lady of Southern Marchmount to her disciples:**\nHer nature is most magnanimous and kind, yet what she hears is urgent, and her responses swift—this only contradicts the intent.\n\nThe matter of the fire-jujubes is not yet fitting to inquire about. *(The discussion of fire-jujubes follows later.)*\n\n**The Perfected Consort of Jiuhua:**\nFrom the Taiyuan era onward, these five entries are all in Yang’s hand.\n\nThe reins of light descend to Canglang’s waves,\nLeaping across the clear sea’s ford.\nCrimson mists swirl beneath the sun,\nFeathered canopies tilt the nine heavens.\nThe cloud-chariot drifts through empty vastness,\nSuddenly tossed amid wind and waves.\nCome seeking friends in the unseen,\nHand in hand to attend the Lord of Dawn.\nThe Prince of Wangzi harmonizes bright virtue,\nTogether they summon the jade worthies.\nBelow, they glance toward the Eightfold Palaces;\nAbove, they repose on the peaks of the rare groves.\nRinsing with purple jade’s richness,\nOnly then do they know the bitterness of the defiled paths.\nWhere now are those fine companions?\nOnly through diligence may one draw near.\n\nOn the evening of the eighteenth day of the seventh month, the Lady of Cloud Forest and Right Radiance bestowed this poem. *(This poem was given to the Senior Scribe, also concerning the clerk’s affairs.)*\n\nExalted joy in the rare groves’ emptiness,\nFar wandering without bound or direction.\nDesolate beyond form and number,\nBeing and nonbeing naturally merge in darkness.\n{亠衅且}{亠衅且}’s virtue and rhythm harmonize,\nDrifting, drifting, pacing the great void.\nLingering amid the waves’ ebb and flow,\nShaking bells to scatter in the wind.\nInwardly illuminating the Sevenfold Dao-Observances,\nOne may attain complete forgetting.\nWhy must one engage in endless exchanges?\nAwait this world’s literary communion.\nThe mysterious mind naturally awakens.\n\nOn the twenty-sixth evening of the seventh month, the Lady of Purple Tenuity composed this admonition for Senior Scribe Xu:\n\nLofty the Jasper Towers’ boundless gates,\nUnfurling crimson to ascend the radiant chambers.\nPurple banners stir the clouds and dawn,\nFeathered auroras soothe the Eight Winds.\nPausing chariots to bathe in emerald streams,\nGathering blossoms on Moon-Support Peak.\nChewing the Threefold Numinous Flowers,\nExhaling and inhaling the Ninefold Spirit-Rays.\nThe cedar’s reckoning knows no end,\nHarmonizing with the sun to nurture the young and ignorant.\nHand in hand, we enter the Hall of Luminous Perfection,\nGazing upward to await the Supreme August One.\nAt the Northern Dipper’s call, the feathered ones sing,\nJade mystery dazzles the assembly of worthies.\nClouds and rivers—how vast the celestial expanse!\nGain and loss are but my own resonance.\nI crane my neck within the clamorous court,\nOpening my heart to the foul and the pure.\nFamiliar with the realm of glory and disgrace,\nRarely do I tread the groves of emptiness.\nA moment’s stillness—why cling to suffering?\nGo forth and behold the azure waves.\n\n*(This admonition was given by the Lady of Right Radiance. Three additional poems were sent with the celestial carriage, all transcribed by the Senior Scribe. The weak and bereaved drift like scattered reeds; the profound spirit remains unexhausted. Dependence and submission arise from different causes.)*\n\nThe cloud-ladder remains unreached;\nthough yearning stirs for onward advance,\none has yet to plumb the depths of the supreme principle.\nYour talent is truly heaven-wrought, its limpid waves\ncongealing into lofty resonance.\nYour aspiration nests the spirit in the Great Mystery,\nawaiting the Purple Court to tread the void.\n\nA heart that penetrates the stagnant and soaring,\na brush that flourishes in dark accord—\nmovement aligns with compass and square,\ncircles and squares alike;\nstillness harmonizes with true savor,\nbreathing forth and drawing in to stir melody.\nThis may be called unfettered virtue, innate power—\ntruly a cause for reverence.\n\nYet impure thoughts remain unloosed,\nmean attachments inwardly entrenched;\nwayward longings do not recede,\nthe spirit-pool stays unclarified.\nThus we have not yet reached the point\nto discourse on the inner and outer realms,\nto navigate the confluence of the Two Radiant Ones.\n\nFor those who miss the moment,\nthe value lies in the power to change.\nLet us release the bonds of conditioned emotion—\nnow is no hindrance.\nThough briefly silencing the clamor of many ears,\nthis alone achieves harmony.\n\nThe path ahead—ever advancing—\nsuch comparisons are not few.\nThe threads of leakage are manifold;\none must ever wage war in secrecy.\nShould the passions scatter in error,\neach affair becomes a loss.\nThe words of awakening are subtle—\nhow then to restrain them?\nHow then to dispel them?\n\nOn the night of the twenty-sixth day of the seventh month, a letter from Lady Youying of Yunlin to the Right King was received. \"Do not reply to this.\" One passage was copied by the Senior Scribe.\n\nWorldly treasures mingle in fragrant exchange,\nDaoist lineages convene in the mystic firmament.\nShaking one’s robes, one seeks the hidden fields;\nturning the carriage amid the winds of dust,\ntrue virtue reflects the numinous radiance.\nThe sharp root blooms in splendid flourish,\nsecret words bring boundless fortune.\nSerene purity upholds the precious real—\nall things ever accord with the symbolic order.\nHand in hand, we share the same coverlet—\nwhy dwell in the realm of human affairs,\nwhere days breed harm and strife?\n\nOn the evening of the twenty-eighth day of the seventh month, Lady Youying of the Right King presented this poem in a letter to Senior Scribe Xu. (In his reply of the twelfth month, the Senior Scribe spoke of \"all things ever accord\"—this was his response to the poem. The phrase \"all things ever accord\" derives from the *Zhouyi*.)\n\nOne passage was copied by the Senior Scribe:\n\nPure echoes scatter through the void,\na divine wind washes the forest.\nThe body transcends the dark thoroughfare,\nthe will chants the numinous tone—\nsuch is the man of benevolent nobility.\nTo show the origins and end of Master Pei to {Xiyin} would suffice.\nThis must surely harmonize.\nYet if the heart of unskillful guidance is inwardly revealed,\nwhat manner of man is Pei?\n({Xiyin} is {Xinyin}, childhood name Fanghui. The origins and end of Master Pei refer to the *Qingling Zhuan*. There are those who have repented their errors and those who master the Seven Classics—thus he was instructed to show them.)\n\nOn the evening of the seventh day of the eighth month, the Lady of Right Excellence presented a letter, instructing it be delivered to Senior Scribe Xu. The following passage was transcribed by Yang. Another was copied by the Senior Scribe:\n\nOne who steadfastly guards the True Unity—within a year, their hair ceases to whiten, and fallen locks regrow. Yet if one is inwardly bound to children and grandchildren, shackled by household affairs, and outwardly entangled in royal duties and the ties of friendship—ears and eyes overtaxed, voice and qi dispersed in service—then the Dao is not single-minded, and one’s conduct yields no benefit.\n\nThose of true talent are often recluses, dwelling deep in forests and mountains, far from the world of men, embracing simplicity. Then must their countenance be like *Ziying*’s, their temples dark as mystery. Jade nectar and golden brew, fire-jujubes and intertwined pears—these are the medicines of ascension, not to be compared with golden elixirs.\n\nYet the benevolent noble’s body has not attained true correctness; impure thoughts fill his heart. I fear such beings will not deign to come. If genuine sincerity is not unified, the Dao too is without partiality—one ought not even inquire. The trees of fire-jujubes and intertwined pears have already taken root in your heart. But if thorns and brambles still mingle there, the two trees remain unseen. I wonder if you might prune the brambles to let these trees grow alone—how fine their fruit would be!\n\nThough this be called a question.\n\nTo seek proximity to these mysteries, you should inquire of the presiding overseer. For three years, we shall correspond thus, beginning from this day. On the seventh night of the eighth month in the *chou* year (these two characters were later added by Director Xu), Cloud-Forest Right Radiance Queen Lady Wang orally transmitted this answer to Director Xu:\n\nThose who calm the heart and empty the form, inwardly observe the inner chambers, embrace the mysterious and contemplate the divine, and single-mindedly guard the True One—such ones’ hair will not turn white, and the bald shall regrow their locks. (The character *zhen* here should be *fa-zhen* [\"hair and truth\"]. The *Yunji qiqian*, fascicle 92, *Record of the Words of the Many Perfected*, reads: \"Now, those whose breasts are tangled with a hundred thoughts, whose spirits are shattered by cold and heat, who attend to official duties amid this world of dust, whose mouths speak of auspicious and inauspicious meetings, whose bodies dwell in the gates of gain and loss—with such manifold cares and ten thousand anxieties as these, though they may possess a true heart, it is surely not steadfast. To embrace the Dao yet not practice it, to grasp the treasure yet not employ it, and still to hope that one’s hair will not turn white—such a thing is rarely heard of.\n\nJade nectar and golden brew, intertwined spirit-pears, square-foot fire-jujubes, and dark-light magic mushrooms—I shall grant these to the Daoist Master Xu in the mountains, not to Director Xu in the world of men.\"\n\nOn the seventh night of the eighth month, Purple Tenuity Queen Lady Wang transmitted this answer to Director Xu.\n\nThe above six clauses were copied by an aide.\n\nI intend to ride east to the mountain peaks,\nTo pause my light and summon the hidden and still.\nVirtue borne on waves arrives,\nTogether we meet at Triple-Mushroom Ridge.\nThe magic mushrooms are indeed edible,\nGranting you endless longevity.\nWith true reverence, offer the golden brew,\nNo need to wait for the hundred-fathom well.\n\nOn the sixteenth evening of the eighth month, the Pure Numinous Perfected transmitted this. The above piece was copied by Director Xu.\n\nEmptiness and harmony may be guarded with strength,\nStillness and solitude may be guarded with softness.\nNow, this stillness and solitude—this is the solitary light’s lone journey.\nWithin your Crimson Palace, can you ascend to the utmost clouds’ dark and distant edge?\n\nThe Dao is easy to hear of, but the trouble lies in its not being true.\nBooks are easy to obtain, but the trouble lies in their not being practiced.\n\nShould one devote oneself solely to this,\nWithin the vast heavens,\nTrue immortals would stand shoulder to shoulder.\nI bear no fault toward those who cannot achieve it.\nIf the mind is unsettled yet one seeks to inscribe,\nDoes one intend to sell it?\nIf the will does not turn toward the real yet one pursues truth,\nDoes it not seem one seeks to display it?\n\nWith hope, I convey this.\nOn the night of the seventeenth of the eighth month,\nThe Lady of Right Florescence transmitted this writing\nTo Director Xu.\n*(This appears to answer his quest for the true, feminine aspect of the One.)*\n\nThe first ancestor planted virtue—\nThe flowering branch of the Weng lineage *(referring to the seventh-generation ancestor, Xu Zhao)*.\nTo halt one’s steps and suspend one’s carriage,\nThere is no \"too early\" or \"too late.\"\nSimply let the heart firmly fix upon the real,\nAnd the subtle, numinous mechanism will suffice.\nAs for soaring to lofty ridges,\nOr slumbering in dark forests and marshes,\nDisdaining the base affairs of the times,\nAbandoning the nine relations to savor the divine—\nThese are indeed noble pursuits.\nYet if the heart is not single-minded,\nAnd wayward thoughts fill the breast,\nThough one treads the peaks of *\n\nLast spring, the master of scriptures instructed me in the Way of the *fangzhu* and the pacing of the Grotto-Chambers, gradually cultivating the Eight Simplicities and the Nine Perfected. I dared not grow remiss in heart. Yet the Nine Perfected require profound stillness—worldly affairs entangle, and the trouble lies in lack of singleness.\n\nOf old, those who sought the Dao would seek teachers and companions, accumulating years upon years, traversing mountains and peaks without cease, enduring hardship and peril, tasting every toil. Only then would they be entrusted with the essential instructions.\n\nMy virtue is meager, my transgressions weighty. Seated upright in my chamber of faults, I have nonetheless been selected and recorded by the host of Perfected. Warnings and admonitions have come in succession, awakening me time and again.\n\nAs the ancients said: \"Not knowing is not the difficulty—practicing is.\" The grace you have bestowed, my lady, may unfold at its own pace. *(This \"must\" is the Prefect’s own hand, altering \"the perilous crags of men.\")* First, I shall move to the Eastern Mountains, and only then receive your direct transmission.\n\nThe coming of the Dao does not reckon swiftness or slowness; the height of your favor knows no bounds of early or late. Commanded by your envoy, how dare I not respond in kind? With reverence, I submit this reply.\n\n(This is the Prefect’s reply to the previous discourse on the feminine aspect of the Right Radiance. The clerk transcribed it, and after the perilous crags were altered, this copy was preserved.)\n\n*Declarations of the Perfected, Scroll the Second.*\n*Declarations of the Perfected, Scroll the Third.*\n*Book of Circulating Images, Chapter Three.*\n\nDuring the Northern Prime of the Primal Mystery, the Lady of Numinous Illumination of the Eastern Palace—younger sister of Li Lingfei, the Jade Youth and Grand Protector, and daughter of Li Qingbin, the Dao Lord of the Northern Mystery—resided in the Vermilion Pavilion of the Thirteenth Terrace of the Square-Zhang Terrace. The Lady wore a robe of purple brocade, bore the talisman of the Divine Tiger, and held a bell of flowing gold. Two handmaidens attended her, both around twenty years of age. The Lady herself appeared to be thirteen or fourteen. She summoned one of the handmaidens, named Hidden Radiance. Both handmaidens wore robes of turquoise damask and carried two crimson jade caskets bound with azure cords. The white jade seals bore the inscriptions *Supreme Petition* and *Supreme Writ*. (This note [identifies] the Yu edition’s correction from “weave” to “inscribe,” matching the earlier Nine Flowers passage.)\n\nThe Lady wore a sash of bluish-jade hue, resembling the insignia pouch of mortals. The concealed petition measured some five *zhang* in length and three to four *chi* in width. As she prepared to depart, she presented a single sheet of verse, then chanted:\n\nThe earthly bonds embrace Heaven’s frame,\nSevenfold qi illumines the divine soaring.\nJade fans unfold at dawn’s first cry,\nNine tones resound within the crimson pivot.\nPurple auroras rise at the vermilion gate,\nIncense smoke drifts from the emerald window.\nFour chariots dance with tiger-banners,\nAzure wheels spin through the dark void.\nCanopies of blossoms trail the clouds,\nFalling phoenixes rein six dragons.\nRiding the light, I course the Five Peaks’ slopes,\nThe Three Pristine gaze upon the Lord’s chamber.\n\nAs I just heard the foul *qi* of fleshly corruption,\nThe myriad impurities surge and churn within my breast.\nVile things assail the spirit with their stench,\nClamorous dusts clash and collide.\nBright jade—all is shattered and crushed—\nWhy alone does the body of sublime virtue endure?\nHad I but raised my hands in parting sooner,\nI would not now sit here, worms breeding in the earth.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-second day of the eighth month, the Lady of Numinous Radiance presented this verse.\n\n(Here the Prefect writes \"Lady of Numinous Radiance,\" while Master Yang’s text often reads \"Radiance of the Numinous.\")\n\nAs she prepared to depart, she chanted:\nLet not the heart be swayed by chaos,\nLet not the spirit be enslaved by dissipation.\nWhen the Dao turns adverse, do not defy it;\nWhen calamity weighs heavy, do not resist.\nTo lose one’s true nature forever—\nIs to forsake my destined path.\nWill I be reborn in the Xu family again?\nI shall return when the time is right.\nStrive on, and that is all.\n\nThe above eight passages from the Northern Origin were transcribed by the Prefect. King Ling of Zhou had thirty-eight sons; Prince Jin was the crown prince, known as Wang Ziqiao. The king’s third daughter, named Guanxiang (style name Zhong’ai), was the daughter of Lady Song. To Ziqiao, she was a half-sister by a different mother. She received from Ziqiao the Dao of flying liberation from the snares of the world and departed to dwell in the mountains of the Wei clan. Later, together with Ziqiao, she entered Luhun, where they remained for thirty-nine years.\n\nGuanxiang attained the Dao and was appointed as the Inner Transmitted Consort of the Purple Clarity Palace, assuming the title of Lady of the True One in the Eastern Palace (this being the Lady of the True One, the King’s Consort). Seven of Ziqiao’s siblings achieved the Dao (five sons and two daughters). Among them, Meishou was Guanxiang’s full brother and likewise attained the Dao. (This appears to refer to a separate account of Meishou, now lost; however, in the records of Yuan’s writings, there is a dream in which someone says, “I am the younger sister of Wang Meishou.” This may well be the response.)\n\nThe above two passages were transcribed by Yang.\n\nRiding the blazing chariot through the eight voids,\nI linger in revelry within the Eastern Flower Chamber.\nThe Celestial Mother invites me to her pavilion,\nWhere I chant aloud, treading the numinous wind.\nI came because I awaited the appointed time,\nThus did I cross the azure waves.\n\n*Song of Lady Ying, the Right Consort*\n\nAscending the nine heavens against the whirlwind,\nI rest my carriage at the Three Radiance Peak.\nI tarry, gazing all around, for I await my time;\nWithout such waiting, one should simply be pure.\nWhy trouble oneself with the azure waves?\nHow could they compare to crossing the Dark Well?\n\n*Lady of the Purple Tenuity’s Response to the Right Consort’s Song*\n\nWithin my golden court I inscribe these words,\nUnbridling my carriage at the Three Radiance Precinct.\nNight mushrooms unfold their blossoms,\nTheir petals chewed to sate eternal hunger.\nI chant aloud, yet find no freedom—\nEach verse arises from the waiting song.\nThe Hollow Cavern echoes with the numinous sound;\nWhat then shall become of those without such waiting?\n\n*Song of the Perfected One of Mount Tongbai*\n\nAt dawn I roam Mount Yujué,\nAt dusk I repose in the Hall of Lofty Radiance.\nI shake my reins and tread the numinous peak—\nNo nearness to the azure waves.\nAt the three-*ren* verge of the Dark Well,\nMy steed finds no ford.\nIn the vast expanse of ninety thousand leagues,\nThe eight directions lie in full view.\nTo have waiting is not yet to reach the ultimate void;\nThe numinous sound suffers loss therein.\n\n*Song of the Perfected One of Pure Numinosity*\n\nDragon banners dance in the Great Void,\nFlying wheels course the slopes of the Five Peaks.\nWherever I go, all is free and unbound.\nMoved by feeling, I chant a song of the unseen;\nWithout waiting surpasses having waiting.\nWhen we meet, harmony is thus attained.\nWhy deem the azure waves too distant?\nThe Dark Well is not too much.\nIn the space of a single step through Yujué,\nAll beneath the four seas is gathered.\nHow could it compare to beyond the radiance of light,\nWhere three kalpas pass but once?\n\n*Song of the Lady of the Central Watch*\n\nFreely drinking, I observe the many blessings—\nSuddenly, all four directions encircle me.\nI know not how this comes to be,\nFor in truth, this is no journey of waiting.\nWhen we meet, all is joy;\nWhen we do not, there is no sorrow.\nMy form wanders the dark void,\nAnd the two meetings naturally align.\n\n*Song of Lady Li of Illustrious Numinosity*\n\nI drive my carriage forth from Western Splendor,\nBetween having waiting and having none.\nNow I gaze upon the peaks of the Five Peaks,\nNow I bathe in the ford of the Celestial River.\nI release my wheels to seek the empty boat;\nWherever I go, all is bound in tenderness.\nA mustard seed suddenly becomes ten thousand acres,\nWithin it stands Mount Sumeru.\nSmall and great are fundamentally no different;\nFar and near share a single cause.\nThey come with waiting,\nWhile I draw near without it.\n\n*Song of Consort An of Mount Jiuhua*\n\nWithout waiting lies the Great Void’s midst,\nWith waiting lies the Great Having’s verge.\nGreat and small are one wave,\nFar and near converge in a single meeting.\nI pluck the strings at the summit of the dark firmament,\nChanting and whistling, I move the eight *qi*.\nWhy not drink deeply of the numinous nectar?\nWith a glance, I delight the nine lineages.\nHaving and lacking attain the mysterious workings;\nThe two waitings thus cover each other.\n\n*Song of the Perfected One of Mount Nanyue in the Great Void*\n\nI repose in the tranquility of Eastern Splendor,\nDirecting the movement of the eight directions.\nLooking down upon the mounds and anthills,\nI perceive not the loftiness of the Five Peaks.\nThe numinous mounds equal the abyssal springs,\nGreat and small follow one another.\nLong and short, more and less—none exist.\nThe great *chun* tree ends in a moment.\nWhy not yield to heaven and follow its course?\nLet the spirit roam freely in the emptiness of sameness.\n\n*Song of the Lords of the Azure Lads of All Directions*\n\nI rein in the whirlwind to fan the Great Void,\nThe Eight Effulgences soar in lofty purity.\nLooking up, I float beyond the Purple Dawn;\nLooking down, I gaze into the abyss of darkness.\nThe dark heart dwells in the emptiness of sameness,\nAbove and below, no flowing or halting.\nWithin the two bounds of having no waiting,\nHaving waiting has no place to abide.\nEmbodying nothingness, one can die;\nEmbodying being, one preserves life.\nThe eastern guests join in the lofty chant—\nWhy dispute the two waitings?\nI command my carriage of jade and brocade,\nReins held high, I wander in contemplation.\nAt dawn I roam the Vermilion Fire Palace,\nAt dusk I feast by the Pool of Moonlight.\nMy floating form rests at the tip of the rosy clouds,\nThe eight dragons stand in uneven array.\nI journey without waiting,\nYet those with waiting ever follow.\nIn the high gathering, the fair ones repose—\nThe two waitings mutually affirm and deny.\nHaving and lacking are not fixed;\nEach waiting returns to itself.\n\n*Song of the Lady of the Purple Prime of the Southern Culmen*\n\n*(Note: These songs and poems all appear to be in the style of initial revelations.)*\n\nYet the many Perfected Ones disdain the lofty chant—\nThe Supreme Void of the Upper Clarity, the Lad of Purple Prime, has never known a place of mixed descent.\nI fear only that these words may be lost or mislaid.\nThe discourse on \"waiting\" all refers to the affair of the Lady of Right Radiance,\nnot to the Consort of Peace.\n\nI soar upon the cloud-lit axle,\nfloating to observe the sky above the rosy clouds.\nThe empyrean stretches wide in dance,\nthe purple canopy rests upon the numinous quarter.\nCrimson mist coils round the banners and pennants,\nfeathered fans stir the fragrant breeze.\nLightning roars as fierce beasts seize their prey,\nthunder rumbles as the dark dragons surge.\nThe tuned pipes resound in the courtyard of Kun,\ngolden reed-organs sing to the divine bells.\nI pluck the magic mushrooms by the azure waves,\ngather blossoms on the eight still peaks.\nMy crimson countenance grows ever new with each day,\nthough kalpas pass, I remain a child.\nI nurture my form in the quiet of the eastern summit,\nthe seven spirits commune of themselves.\nYet the dust of the world bears sorrow and lament—\nit casts me down as a white-haired elder,\nlong lost in distant sighs.\nI regret not having fled sooner.\nOn the evening of the third day of the ninth month,\nthis was composed by the Lady Wang of Cloudy Grove,\nand shown to the Chronicler Xu.\nI halt my chariot, gazing as the moon’s charioteer moves on,\nturning my wheels back toward the azure waves.\nBefore I saw the wanderings of such a one,\nI idly wondered how peace might be found.\nA good cause awaits the green spring,\nthat I may unburden my heart and forget.\n\n*To the right: The Lady of Right Radiance chanted this again and again.*\n\nThe Tortoise Watchtower stands in solemn majesty,\nthe earthen terrace is strung with pearls of moonlight.\nSeated in the chamber of the Nine Numinous Ones,\nwe strike the jade chimes and chant the Great Nothingness.\nJade flutes harmonize with my spirit,\ngolden nectar dispels my cares.\nAs the feast grows merry within the Eastern Flower,\na thousand melodies are arrayed in perfect tune.\nThe Azure Lord calls me to rise,\nI bow low, yearning for the forest court.\nFeathered fans gleam with kingfisher radiance,\nhow the jade pendants chime and ring!\nTogether we point toward the lofty morning repose,\nand vow to meet in the depths of the Image.\n\n*To the right: The Purple Tenuity chanted these two songs.*\n\nI ascend beyond the crimson empyrean,\nborne on the flying gale to the northern mound.\nDivine splendor illumines the immortal terrace,\nthe round luminaries tilt with the wind.\nI open the radiance of the Cinnabar Prime,\nthe gate of light feeds on the moon’s essence.\nSleeves intertwined in the cloud-grove hall,\nmy hair and form return to childlike freshness.\nHow desolate—this lodging without abode!\nHow could right and wrong ever be my concern?\n\nAmidst the ranks, self-disturbance vies—\nhow could one speak of nurturing life?\n\n*To the right: Composed by the Purple Tenuity of the Dark Mound.*\n\nI rein in the dawn, floating on purple mist,\nthe Eight Sceneries behold the flowing melons of water.\nFeathered lads bear chalices of jade nectar,\njade blossoms toast with lush laminae.\nWe vow to meet at the Whitewater shore,\nraising my withered pearl of life.\nThe azure chamber gleams with eastern dawn,\nthe Purple Creation drifts on the crimson morn.\nThe Twin Virtues grasp the Dao’s essence,\nestablishing the true lord’s domain.\nThe Eight Terraces lie within my gaze—\nnorthward, I see the Flying Origin.\nIn clarity and stillness, I survey from the clouds,\ndimly treading the shifting light.\nExhaling and inhaling, I master the cave’s elegance,\nconcealing radiance behind the eastern mountain.\nLong have I dwelled amidst human affairs,\neach day without idle leisure.\nHow could it compare to transforming this aged form,\nreturning to a child’s countenance?\n\nOn the evening of the sixth day of the ninth month,\ncomposed in the Cloud Grove, addressed to Lord Xu.\n\nI unyoke my wheels at the Great Auroral Heights,\ngathering reins to ascend the Purple Mound.\nIn hand, the Eight Emptinesses—\nI cast myself afloat amid the clouds.\nA single glance governs the workings of creation,\na second gaze seeks the lofty wilds.\nThe Dao’s essentials are now complete.\n\nOn the evening of the sixth day of the ninth month,\nPurple Mictrocosm Lady composed this,\naddressed to Chief Scribe Xu\nand to fellow disciples—\n(the fellow disciple being Fang Hui).\n\nThis can dissolve a thousand sorrows,\nseeking truth, one finds true companions.\nWhat more could one seek?\n\nAt dawn, the auroral towers are framed,\njade chambers rise in the limpid heavens.\nI grasp the three wondrous visions,\nfloating light soars through the utmost void.\nWithin the cinnabar void dwell the Perfected,\ngolden radiance nurtures their flourishing essence.\nThe eight winds stir embroidered coverlets,\nverdant trees illumine the four numina.\nThe flowered canopy spreads its orchid brilliance,\npurple reins urge the green steed onward.\nBinding trust, I commune with the divine,\ntouching all things, I follow celestial sincerity.\nWhy be moved by external phenomena?\nOne must behold the jade and jeweled splendor.\n\nOn the ninth day of the ninth month,\nCloud Grove’s Right Radiance Lady composed this.\n\nThe purple void gleams with bright light,\nthe Dark Palace girds the crimson river.\nIn solemn ranks, the Upper Clarity chambers stand,\ncloud terraces gleam, towering and majestic.\nEight chariots arrive at the vermilion pool,\nfeathered canopies tilt toward the celestial branches.\nThe thunderous wind revolves the three luminaries,\ngolden bells scatter jade blossoms.\nSeven reins weave through the nine realms,\nat ease, my gaze need not return home.\nI ask the seekers of the Dao:\nwhy remain mired in the dust and waves?\nHow could one not nest in eastern splendor,\ncultivating the true and gathering grand harmony?\n\nOn the ninth day of the ninth month,\nPurple Mictrocosm Lady composed this,\naddressed to Xu and to Fang Hui—\n(Fang Hui being the same as before).\n\nThe twin luminaries flourish in dark luxuriance,\nheavenly radiance brightens the eight directions.\nCinnabar clouds float in the lofty dawn,\ncarefree, I ride the numinous wind.\nBeating the feathered drum, I mount the white whirlwind,\nraising my gaze within the jade tower.\nThe green canopy enters the harmonious dawn,\nthe azure pennant streams through the empty sky.\nTo the right, I salute the Lord of the Eastern Grove,\nascending to court the Emperor of the Great Void.\nJade guests carve phoenix-brain,\nroaring with delight, they drink flying-petal nectar.\nCloud hooks turn in the winding chambers,\na thousand tones—how resonant!\nBroidered banners summon fierce beasts,\nflowered streamers rise and fall.\nFragrant mothers bend in song,\npurple mist parts the roof beams.\nGathering reins at the lofty clear gates,\nI unharness my carriage in the chamber of beauties.\n\nYesterday’s fate bore no sign,\nspiritual transformation soars with the qi’s flight.\nMy heart, distant, stirs at the dark shore,\nyears pass like the towering sandalwood.\nMy form delights in filth and stench,\nin motion and stillness, I lose the azure waves.\nYet my friends are not thus—\nglory and disgrace were forgotten long ago.\n\nOn the night of the eighteenth day of the ninth month,\nCloud Grove’s Right Radiance Lady composed this.\nShe declared:\nMy words end here.\n\nThe crimson light floats in the dark dawn,\nthe purple carriage rides the misty journey.\nLooking up, I transcend the green gates,\ngazing down, I behold the vermilion fire city.\nEastern auroras unfurl their vast brilliance,\ndivine radiance illumines the seven numina.\nShimmering reflections ripple the three torches,\nflowing freely, I equal the void.\nWind coils through the hollow heavens,\nfragrant tones arise with each measure.\nHand in hand with the weaving maidens,\nwe share sashes in the gourd garden.\nTo the left, I circle the azure feathered banner.\n\nThe flowery canopy follows the clouds in their tilt,\nmy tranquil rest surpasses ninefold measures.\nRight and wrong do not occupy my mind—\nembracing truth, I dwell in the Great Stillness.\n\nGolden *zi* (here corrected to \"form\")—how could it compare\nto the filth and foulness of the world,\nwhere life is bleak and without solace?\n\nOn the night of the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month,\nCloud Grove’s Right Radiance Lady composed and transmitted this.\n\nThree reins raise the purple carriage,\nclouds tilt toward the eastern forest’s slope.\nRight Radiance chanted this Dao,\nand from the right, thirteen soaring verses came—\nall in Yang’s hand, with some passages transcribed by scribes.\n\nTo dispel stagnation and stinginess,\none must rely on exhausting virtue’s practice—\nis this not most excellent?\nDo not fear that virtue will go unrewarded,\nbut rather that the planting of blessings is too meager.\nThis single line may well be a field of fortune.\nAll matters are thus—\none may infer the rest by analogy.\n\nOn the third day of the twelfth month,\nCloud Grove’s Right Radiance Lady spoke.\nThis passage is in Yang’s hand,\nwith another version slightly variant.\n\nMu, humbly and with awe, says:\nYour boundless benevolence,\ngraciously bestowing new poems—\ncloud-like elegance woven in brocade,\ngolden tones and jade-like brilliance—\ntruly the rarest bloom of the literary grove,\nthe grandest display of embroidered splendor.\nTheir meaning runs deep and subtle,\ngazing upward, one finds no limit.\nI wear them in my cinnabar heart,\ncherishing them in every turn.\nThough my merit is shallow and crude,\nthe unseen recompense is already weighty.\nThe metaphor of the field of fortune—\nhow dare I not rouse myself?\nRelying on your noble guidance,\nmy gratitude is as vast as mountains and seas.\nIn movement and stillness, I seek enlightenment—\nI hope you will deign to record my plea.\n\nMu, humbly and with awe, says:\nPresented before the loom of Cloud Grove’s Right Radiance Lady.\n(This is the reply to the letter on dispelling stagnation and stinginess,\nwith a draft preserved.)\n\nThe Azure Lad often chants:\n\"To plant the roots of extinction,\none must uproot the seeds of life and death.\nBrooding, one sinks into the nine springs—\nall for clinging to this bodily frame.\"\n\nThe Master of the Great Void often chants:\n\"Observe when spirit bears form—\nit is like a cart following a horse.\nWhen the cart breaks, the horse bolts and flees,\ndragging along this transient union.\nAlas, the world does not recognize this—\nall they cherish is the wind and fire.\nPlanting sins in the heavenly net,\nthey suffer poison in the hells below.\"\n\nThe Perfected of Western City, Lord Wang, often chants:\n\"Spirit is the boat that ferries form,\nbut the shallow shore is where they must part.\nForm is not spirit’s eternal abode,\nspirit is not form’s constant bearer.\nWandering the wheel of life and death,\nthey suffer only from hesitation of heart.\"\n\nThe Perfected of Lesser Existence, Lord Wang, often chants:\n\"Losing the Dao, one follows the ford of death,\nthe three souls stray from the path of life.\nThe day of life grows ever distant,\nthe day of death arrives all too soon.\nAlas, the sorrowful face of suffering—\nroots and blossoms already inverted.\nRising to meet the kalpa’s fall,\nhow can one know the return to withered age?\"\n\nOn the autumn equinox of the previous month,\nat the Jade Terrace Grand Assembly,\nthe four lords each chanted these words,\nharmonizing with the strings of the *Xuanjun Guangshao*.\n(In the tenth month, it was said \"the previous month\"—\nhere corrected to \"between,\" for the autumn equinox must fall in the eighth month,\nthus \"the previous month\" naturally makes sense.)\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the tenth month,\nRight Radiance Lady spoke this and ordered it recorded.\nThese five passages are in the scribes’ hand.\n\nThe four luminaries shine in the void,\nthe vermilion carriage flies over the numinous mound.\nThe jade canopy shades the seven radiances,\ndrums and feathered banners float above the clouds.\nThe nine tones resound through the purple void,\njade echoes pierce the Great Nonbeing.\nFeasting and chanting in the palace of the three luminaries,\nsinging and calling to our companions—\nunaware that the *chun* tree has already come,\nhow could we know the flow of the two effulgences?\nThough the fair one may forget both,\na hundred sorrows are not yet released.\nThe long forest is truly still,\nin the cliffs, there is much delight.\n\nOn the seventeenth day of the tenth month,\nCloud Grove Lady composed this for Lord Xu.\n\nGrasping the jade flowery canopy in her left hand,\nshe rides the radiance, treading the seven origins.\nThe three luminaries gleam with purple brilliance,\nshe rises and gazes, caressing the bright Perfected.\nIn an instant, she leaps and transforms—\nall four sides are already divine.\nHer numinous hair knows no bounds,\nearnestly pondering the scriptures of the Upper Clarity.\nWhy does this random *shuiyu* arise,\ncausing you to lose focus?\nLosing the *xuan* mechanism in a flash—\nunaware that the years have parted.\n\nOn the eighteenth day of the tenth month.\n\nPurple Tenuity Lady composed this.\n\nThe two preceding pieces bear Yang’s calligraphy.\n\nNorthward we ascend the Gate of Dark Perfection,\nhand in hand weaving the lofty net.\nFragrant smoke scatters across the Eight Sceneries,\nthe Dark Wind stirs the crimson waves.\nGazing upward, we transcend the Ford of Lang Garden;\nlooking down, we glimpse the slopes of Cloudy Mound.\nJade flutes sing above the clouds,\nphoenixes cry in the Nine Distances.\nRiding qi, we float through the Great Void—\nwhy tread upon mountains and rivers?\nWith golden tally we summon the feathered numina,\nour marching host shatters the ten thousand demons.\nTogether we grasp the twin morning glories,\na thousand kalpas yet in infancy.\nLosing the Real, we plunge into the chamber of strife—\nhow could one not understand this?\nLifting our eyes to the Palace of Great Radiance,\ngolden pavilions gleam with Purple Clarity.\nFlowering chambers reflect the Great Simplicity,\nall four porticoes are of vermilion jasper.\nWe cast our wheels into the Ford of Empty Sameness,\ngathering the reins in verdant dance.\nJade blossoms fly as cloudy canopies,\nthe Western Consort unfurls her brocade banner.\nSuddenly we turn beyond the shores of turbid dust,\nin an instant we arrive at the courtyard of the fair one.\nLong-awaited resonance brings timely descent—\nwhat was summoned now dwells in darkness.\nRiding the wind, we offer dawn’s melody,\ntogether we feast from the cinnabar-jade flasks.\nDukes and lords are but fleeting shadows—\nhow could they know the numen of the Perfected?\n\nThe two preceding pieces were transmitted on the twentieth day of the tenth month.\n(These too should be the admonitions of Right Radiance to the Chief Scribe.)\n\nThe two preceding pieces bear Yang’s calligraphy.\nThough carriages and horses are weighty,\nthey are seized by passersby.\nTo yield one’s portion and follow fate—\nthis is how summons are answered.\nThere is no need for reluctance.\n\nThe {wooden figurine} was indeed small,\nyet still stolen by a child-scribe.\nThus I grieved and cherished it—\nnow the unseen mirror has seized the thief.\nThis serves to distinguish the fearful from the good.\nThough for now {silent},\nthe petty-minded will know its numinous efficacy.\nThere is instruction within,\nnot mere trifling.\nIf even in such small matters one cannot be forthright—\nRespectfully reported.\nPresented to Cloud-Grove Right Radiance, the Lady.\nOn the nineteenth day of the eleventh month.\n(This answers Right Radiance’s transmitted matter,\nthough the original affair no longer exists.)\n\nI, Mu, humbly and fearfully speak:\nMired in vulgar dust,\nadrift in the murk of the world,\nmy transgressions grow with the years,\nmy faults accumulate with the days.\nFortunate to encounter this mysterious turning,\nthe numinous awakened its convergence.\nDispersing the mists of delusion,\nI suddenly attained clarity.\nThe true and numinous, pure and refined,\ntogether bestowed admonition and awakening.\nOverwhelmed by such literary grace,\nwhere blossoms form forests,\ngolden tones and jade resonance,\nrules and patterns in perfect order—\na father and son of common worth\ncould never bear such a burden.\nRising early, I spur myself on,\ndaring not grow idle or lax.\n{Anxiously} {anxiously} pouring forth,\nmy words cannot fully express myself.\nI, Mu, humbly and fearfully speak.\n(This too answers Right Radiance’s poem,\nthough it is unclear which poem,\nand it too seems no longer extant.)\n\nThe above two passages are from the Chief Scribe’s own hand.\n\nThe numinous valley’s radiant waves flourish,\nconcealing the self in the capital of crags.\nClad in coarse cloth, equal to dragon-robes,\ngirded with rope, matching jade chimes.\nThe form coils in distant seclusion,\nthe spirit soars to the courts of the great dawn.\nAbove the clouds stand the steps of the worthy,\nin the void resounds the true voice.\nRestraining my crooked dawn-flight,\nI inspect this green chariot,\ngazing down upon the eight degrees within,\nsighing over the {winding threads} of wind and dust.\nLiberation leaves waves behind—\nascending this boundless purity,\nI tremble at the exhaustion of the three fordings,\nracing to sever the bonds of your years.\n\nOn the first night of the twelfth month.\nComposed by the Lady of Southern Marchmount for Chief Scribe Xu.\n\nThe flying wheel ascends the high dawn terrace,\nreining in at the dark mound’s corner.\nHand in hand with the Purple Emperor’s sleeve,\n{driven} by the eight winds.\nJade splendor wings the green curtains,\nblue {kerchief} fans the kingfisher skirts.\nThe crown’s chariot gleams, towering,\npendants tinkle with moon-pearls.\nLightly entering the midst of wind and dust,\nblocking the nose to flee the path ahead.\nFoul stench corrupts my qi,\na hundred afflictions twist my heart.\nWhy not rise on the whirlwind,\nstepping lightly through the great void?\n\nOn the first night of the twelfth month.\nComposed by Lady Zhao of the Left Terrace of Fangzhang for Xu Yufu.\n\nAt dawn I bow to the crimson dawn-glow,\ngathering qi to wander above the clouds.\nTreading the winding waves,\nI suddenly witness the sorrows of worldly men.\nWords and intent rise like lush growth,\nyet the three immortal herbs do not scatter.\nHow much better to roam the dark realm,\nstroking the jade zither for your delight.\nYou dwell in what has bounds—\nI long for what is boundless within.\n\nThe Lady of Right Radiance composed this.\nDriving the light-chariot, she roams with the worthy,\nurging the reins beneath the eastern garden.\nThe Lady of Right Radiance chants this Dao:\nchewing the dark phrases,\nher gentle voice swells and flows.\nThe melody’s turns suit its unfolding,\nher words and metaphors shine clear.\nHer reverent song—\nthere is reason for it.\nThe Dark Ancestor is at peace—\nI shall join him.\n\nOn the fourteenth day of the twelfth month.\nComposed by the Lady of Cloudy Forest for the Chief Scribe.\n(This answers the Chief Scribe’s poem—\nthe poem itself is no longer extant.)\n\nThese five pieces bear Yang’s calligraphy—\nprofound and pure, the Dao is hard to fathom,\nyet they penetrate its subtle mysteries.\nSuch is Lord Xu:\nsoon he shall illuminate the sacred mound,\nleaping through the radiant clouds,\nhis body soaring through the nine heavens,\nhis works guiding the host of immortals,\nteacher and mentor of the Golden Gates.\n\nWith the intent to *rescue* and reform the multitudes,\nhis virtue flows with benevolence,\nhis teachings are ordered yet harmonious.\nOne might call him a celestial blossom of refined elegance,\na master craftsman for later generations.\n\nThe Axe-Child, in hidden dawn’s radiance,\nascends through the empty heavens,\nentrusting his heart to the Dark Abode,\nhis spirit nesting within the collar of insight.\nHis mind wields the blade of stillness,\nhis form returns to the Great Beginning.\nWithin and without, he severs ties of kinship,\nconsigning secret meetings to hidden contemplation.\n\nThough he reflects that entering the shelter of layered peaks\nwould veil his brilliance in clouded obscurity,\nhe rebelled against his father—\nif his father’s folly permitted it.\n\nYet when kindred spirits are bound in the same cloud-bound records,\ntheir names inscribed on the tablets of the numinous,\ntheir destinies converging in encounter,\nhow could one not declare it?\n\nOf old, Xue Lü, styled Jihe,\nwent to study the true Dao at the northern slope of Mount Zhong.\nAfter seven trials, he failed to pass.\nHe was the younger brother of Lord Xue of Changli.\nHis failure stemmed from lust *{or the loss of a woman}*, losing his station,\nstinginess and vulgarity clogging his inner being,\nhis nature stubborn as stone, unyielding—\nthus he ruined his trial.\n\nYet the man was kind, gentle, and sincere,\nhis heart fond of the phoenix-like trill of whistling,\nthe resonance of dark strings.\nThus, in empty song, his spirit congealed,\nthe pure tones stirring his soul.\nHis spirit did not descend—\nall because of his love for whistling and his longing for the phoenix’s cry.\n\nLord Changli,\na man of Yan and Dai,\nlived in the time of King Wu of Zhou.\nThe Master begged the Supreme One on his behalf,\nand the Supreme One thus allowed him to live,\n*[or: to continue the work of the northern slope’s destiny]*\nso that he might encompass the subtle and dissolve stagnation,\n*[or: now the Yu edition reads “令” (to cause), which is correct]*\nrefining and tempering new radiance,\nhastening his ascent to the emptiness beyond.\n\nLord Changli’s wish was this:\nif the waves of transgression do not surge,\nif lust and stinginess recede,\neven after a hundred trials,\nwould he not be like Xue Lü of old?\n\nMasters and disciples pledge to one another,\npolishing and adorning to fulfill their nature.\nIf one can accomplish this,\nI, too, shall seldom labor.\nThe conduct of the worthy—\nthis, again, deserves careful consideration.\n\nThe secret revelation traces back to the origins of past lives.\nIt is hoped that this may bring awakening.\nWith qi of the Yan nestled within and yielding without,\ndeep virtue delights in luminous scenes.\nThus, when such a one hears the northern wind, the heart grows sorrowful;\nwhen beholding the dawn’s radiance, they embrace peace.\nThey yearn for swift steeds to gallop in admiration,\nand praise gentle compliance that transforms into flourishing.\nThat person’s heart—\nhow could it not be thus?\nThis is the qi of their native land,\nthe inner resonance of returning to the first hill.\n\nIf one can trust in this,\nyou shall attain harmony.\nBut if avarice and desire obstruct,\ncinnabar and crimson fail to flow freely.\nThe numinous ones take hands and depart in vain,\nlofty companions gather their sleeves and turn away.\nThe spirit and qi do not glance upon their dwelling,\nthe silent penetration does not stir their eyes.\nSuch is fate—\ntruly, is it not lamentable?\n\n*(Lord Changli’s younger brother, originally from Yan and Dai,\nthus speaks of the customs of his homeland\nto illustrate the heart of the elder scribe.)*\n\nOn the night of the sixteenth day of the twelfth month,\nYouying delivered this message.\n\nThe two preceding texts were transcribed by Yang.\nThe Supreme Perfection Realized One,\nCloud Forest Right Radiance Lady Wang,\nSouthern Peak Purple Void Primordial Sovereign,\nNine Flowers True Consort,\nPure Numinous Realized One,\nPurple Yang Realized One,\nPaulownia Cypress Realized One,\nand Illustrious Lady Li—\nthese eight,\non the night of the seventeenth day of the twelfth month,\nin the eastern chamber of the Fangzhu Palace,\nsang the songs of the Divine Consort:\n\n*\"Purple cassia grows in the jade garden,\ncrimson blossoms resound with a mournful cry.\nThe Moon Palace births buds from the abyss,\nwithin the Sun lies a pool of nephrite.\nTo the left, the full orb of numinous radiance is drawn forth;\nto the right, the crimson glow of rosy clouds is grasped.\nFlowing gold illumines the vermilion court,\nthe eight scenes transcend the return of mist.\nThe green canopy floats in bright clarity,\ncommanding the nodes to summon the Supreme Subtlety.\nThe phoenix essence, the youthful countenance of splendor.\"*\n\nThe jadelike richness fills the hunger of the flesh—\nEmending to \"hunger\" as per the Yuanyou manuscript, which is correct.\nGrasping the dawn, they bow to the Great Simplicity,\nRiding flames to soar the jade steps.\nExhaling and inhaling the six numinous qi,\nJade consorts follow with towels in hand.\nStrumming the *jade-excited* southern cloud fan,\nFragrant winds stir the brocade robes.\nStriking the *shang* note, the hundred beasts dance,\nThe Six Heavens seize their divine might.\n*Youhei* and *yanqian* span billions of kalpas,\nThe ages rise in towering majesty.\nThe small fry are not yet cooked in the tripod—\nThey say, \"I grieve beneath the crags.\"\n\n(According to Yang Jun’s record: Within the red qi of the east, a voice spoke: *\"The small fry are not yet cooked in the tripod— / They say, 'I grieve beneath the crags.'\"*\nThis matter should be reported to the Controller of Destinies, hence the response in this poem, including the following verses.)\n\n**Song of the Left Lady of the Northern Ting Palace in the Dark Clarity of the Supreme Subtlety:**\nDense mists are not true emptiness,\nThe Great Void is my abode.\nHow could the Dark Lord bear longing?\n*Yingsi* vines shroud the lonely, what sorrow!\nThe falling phoenix reins in purple mist,\nThe bridle raised to ascend the morning shore.\nSilent, boundless, without limit,\nRadiant, gazing into the void.\nHidden mushrooms bloom on Phoenix Hill,\nLingering by the jade forest’s edge.\nThe dragon embryo cradles your form,\nEight jades revolve in the white dawn.\nJade blossoms flourish in the jade palace,\nBroidered petals gleam on the crags.\nThe roc’s fan spans a hundred million plumes,\nStroking the *liyu* feathers to soar the empyrean.\nIn the western court, they command the long song,\nStrumming the *jade-excited* zither on the void.\nEight winds entwine the green eaves,\n*Juyan* mists suddenly disperse.\nDivine youths hurl flowing gold,\nThe Supreme Subtlety opens its jade portal—\nEmending to \"portal\" as per the manuscript.\nThe Three Origins rise in obeisance,\nThe Purple Sovereign waves his sleeve in praise.\nBrightly shines the fan of light,\nBrilliantly gleams the Long Star.\nTranscendent, the blade of clarity—\nA downward glance makes my heart ache.\nPity the earthbound immortals:\nWhy do they dwell in forests and ravines?\n\nOn the night of the seventeenth day of the twelfth month, the Supreme Prime Perfected One and the Lord Controller of Destinies produced this poem, stating it was a song from the inner chambers of the Azure Lad’s Palace, constantly chanted to harmonize with the spirits.\n\n(That night, the host of perfected descended in assembly, yet only this text remained. The rest were not revealed. Later, in the *dingmao* year, during the resolution of the Ting matter, it was also the seventeenth day of the twelfth month—perhaps a coincidence, for the prior event could not have occurred in a *mao* year.)\n\nThe three entries above bear Yang’s hand.\nThe *Xuanxuan* then rises in sequence—\nAnnotated thus.\n\nThus, the *Xuanxuan* takes the Eight Winds as its lock—[the *Zhengao*, fascicle seventeen, leaf one, renders this as \"sack of stone and wood,\" which is correct]—the key. Heaven and Earth serve as its ramparts, the Four Seas as its urn, and the Nine Provinces as its chaff. Layered with ten thousand distinctions, steamed by yin and yang, its forging is replete with piled-up embers, swelling and surging. Hard and soft, clear and turbid, the forms and categories differ. Inhaling and exhaling, merging and parting, Gong, Bo, and Rong—annotated thus:\n\nThe Nine-Perfected Beast is a divine fowl, dwelling amid the fiercest of the fierce, cunning in the throes of the most extraordinary. A thousand years are not enough to exhaust its transformations; ten thousand distinctions are not enough to contain its essence. Sun and moon are not enough to illuminate its brow; the Eight Marshes are not enough to immerse its feet. Pure clouds are too base for it, the Nine Boundaries too shallow, the Eight Vastnesses too small, the Four Poles too near. Ever shifting, ever changing, it constantly enters even the mustard seed’s interior. It is the Jade Morning’s jade treasure, the Supreme Subtlety’s majestic spirit.\n\n(These two entries are explanations of the hidden text in the \"Divine Tiger.\" It is unknown which Perfected One revealed them, nor are dates provided. Both were written in the same hand.)\n\nMy lord speaks in awe and trepidation: \"Virtue’s radiance flows and shines, lofty and vast, all-encompassing. With every bestowed written message, grace extends in tender bonds. Your decrees bear the harmony of eternal compliance; your ancestral summons, the assembly of the Mystic Empyrean. Though I revere and long for honor and exaltation, I rejoice in the thought of the numinous decrees.\"\n\nFearing that the near brilliance of {flame’s embers} cannot rival the distant splendor of the Twin Radiance, and that this humble lodging of {shallow wisdom} is unfit to stand among the numinous contemplation of the Seven Origins—nobility and baseness occupy separate realms, high and low distinct stations. Looking up and down, I lose myself, knowing not where to rest.\n\nThose who kindly guide urge diligent refinement; those who cherish with loyalty fret over indolence. Thus the *Great Change* speaks of ceaseless vigilance, and Confucius sighs over the weariness of unflagging effort.\n\nSince receiving your teachings, I have cleansed my heart and roused myself, bathing in renewal. Your exhortations illuminate the wondrous subtleties of attaining the Dao; your admonitions lay bare the fundamental traces of past lives. Excess and stinginess erode one’s foundation; vulgar stagnation severs virtue. Though the physician Lu offers his needles and moxa, and Bian Que his medicinal stones, none can compare to your guidance.\n\nZizhang preserved the sagely teachings on his sash; Dong of the West wore soft and taut cords to correct himself. Thus do external restraints govern the inner self, and righteousness regulate the heart. Reverently embracing your pure instructions, I inscribe them in my innermost thoughts, treasuring them within the six viscera, upholding them in all my conduct, never daring to lose or neglect them. May the Five Perils melt like ice at the furnace’s gate, and the Seven Trials calm like winds in the valley’s depths.\n\nSoon I shall wander freely on Eastern Mountain, building my retreat in Dragon Grove. The numinous edifice will stand in quiet grandeur, the garden’s depths serene. In the courtyard, cloud-borne chariots shall gather rare companions; in the hall, feather-robed Perfected Ones shall assemble. There, golden staves and five-spirit mushrooms shall be bestowed as treasures, and the azure waves shall offer gifts of longevity.\n\nThis aspiration has been my earnest wish day and night, a vow I dare not deceive before the divine luminaries. May you but grant it your discernment.\n\nThe Master, trembling with reverence, replied:\n\n*(This is the Prefect’s response to the Right Radiance’s poem of the twenty-eighth day of the seventh month, which exuded rare fragrance, and also repays the earlier letter discussing Xue Lü’s affairs—though this may still belong to the twelfth month.)*\n\nThis single piece was transcribed by Scribe Yi.\n\n*True Reports, Scroll the Third*\n*True Reports, Scroll the Fourth*\n*Chapter Four: \"The Turning of the Celestial Mechanism\"*\n\nThe Dao of immortals is profoundly still; even to pursue it leaves one without encouragement—how much more so to seek it in boundless expanse? Yet should Eastern Mountain suddenly bear trays of coagulated stone marrow, purple mushrooms gleaming through the groves, luminous jewels blazing like torches, swallow-womb jade illuminating the peaks, and numinous springs flowing freely; should the host of Perfected Ones array their hymns, and every visitor pluck dark blossoms to receive jade fat, gazing upon the Heavenly Immortals to disperse worldly cares—then we shall surely join hands and ascend the Great Void, riding the auspicious clouds in their woven chariots.\n\nShould I not inquire whether you hasten with blade or strength to keep your appointment? These past two days—have you merely wandered hills and marshes, or has official or private urgency pressed upon you, leaving no fruit of your intent? The cause of your slackening and difficulty lies, I suspect, in dimly weighing the balance between presence and absence. If absence is my expectation, then I too shall be absent. Yet within the void there are truths—have you not glimpsed them? One cannot call such faint resemblances rare. What I hope for is but that you not leave me *unclothed*—these two days may pass unfulfilled, but when might you deign to turn your carriage toward Jinling?\n\n*On the night of the twenty-ninth day of the eleventh month.*\n*The Perfected Record Keeper addresses Lord Xu.*\n\nHow could one sever the near stagnation of the present to yearn for distant achievements, hard to complete? If you still nest your heart in groves and mounds, relying on the capital’s proximity, then gazing upon Jinling may stir fleeting thoughts—but I shall leave the choice to you. Do not say I lack means to follow or mirror your absence. A mind divided cannot test the unglanced-at; a spirit wearied cannot give rise to teaching. The conduct of the worthy—can it not be examined?\n\nThe Lord of Life Preservation addresses this.\n\nThe two preceding passages from Yang’s letter are indeed most truthful. In response to the missive of the twenty-ninth day of the eleventh month: those who attain the Dao do so by their ability to cast off all encumbrances and advance directly toward it. Thus, all affairs become purified of themselves, and every duty disperses like clouds. For those already endowed with excellence, this is no labor; for those who struggle through hardship, it may serve to manifest the heart. In the first month, a guest from Mount Gui will surely come to the Eastern Mountain. At that time, could you not lend your full strength?\n\nHaving read your noble command, my joy is boundless. Since the beginning of this month, both public and private matters have pressed upon my hand, preventing me from following my heart’s desire. Once the *zanzu* arrives in the capital, I shall reckon the days for the return journey, bathe, and personally attend court to pay homage—all within this month. If the auspicious day has not yet passed, I humbly request your instruction.\n\nMoreover, regarding the conduct of the worthy, it warrants further scrutiny. Before receiving the supreme Dao, there were those who sought to sway others’ minds and those who claimed to be capable of refinement and encouragement. After receiving the hidden scriptures, such schemes all vanish into obscurity.\n\n*(Here two characters are damaged, and a line has been trimmed away. Later, it appears there was further text. This discussion of the worthy’s conduct seems to continue from the previous letter, responding to the missive of the twenty-ninth day of the eleventh month. That earlier letter is no longer extant, and its wording differs. It also mentioned the guest from Mount Gui arriving in the first month. This reply may thus correspond to the Perfected Record Keeper’s later address, or perhaps such words were also included in Lady Youying’s letter. The record is incomplete, and clear evidence is lacking.)*\n\nThe two preceding pieces are copies in the Long Historian’s own hand. Let the diligent be diligent in their affairs, and let them immerse themselves in the profound subtleties. The cautious, too, may draw parallels and act accordingly. The difficulty of studying the Dao cannot be put into words. Those who feel shame at vulgarity are still far from the Way. Only after thorough cultivation may one attain true worth.\n\nThe worthy’s conduct must begin anew. For now, one should inwardly forget.\n\nThe Purple Tenuity Lady spoke these words.\n\n*(This is the Purple Tenuity’s response to the Long Historian’s reply to Lady Youying regarding the worthy’s conduct. After the Long Historian’s wife passed away, he wished to take a concubine and attend to the affairs of the Seven Primes household, both of which are strictly forbidden. Hence, the matter is repeatedly addressed.)*\n\nThe brushwork flows with such ease—like the parable of Master Lu, it bears the efficacy of Wei and Xian’s counsel. To thaw the frozen furnace door is indeed a fine intent. One must set one’s heart truly upon this deliverance.\n\n**Record of the Register of Destinies.**\n\n*(This is the Central Lord’s response to the Long Historian’s reply to Lady Youying, further praising his words.)*\n\nThe heart has already arrived—there is no need to journey to the mountains. Those who empty their minds to face the Real, who offer single-minded sincerity to float upon the Dao—though they may wish not to be taught, how could it be so? Gazing toward the mountains and marshes is but an afterthought. Yet those utterly devoid of longing truly leave one disheartened. Now, let it cease.\n\n**On the first day of the twelfth month, at night, the Register of Destinies addressed Lord Xu.**\n\n*(Upon examination, this seems to respond to the matter of his arrival in the capital and inability to come. The affairs are intertwined and difficult to untangle.)*\n\n**On the twenty-seventh day of the first month:**\nWill you not even briefly visit the site where you intend to build your dwelling? The Perfected One of Tortoise Mountain should arrive on that day. If he does not truly come to the retreat, there need be no semblance of it. Do you merely wish for him to see me?\n\n**On the fourteenth day of the first month, the Preserver of Life declared.**\n\n*(This declaration closely resembles the previously questioned matter, hence its convoluted obscurity. From this first month onward, all pertains to events in the bingyin year.)*\n\n---\n\n**The following five passages were written by Yang:**\n\nReining in the light, I ascend the dawn’s empyrean,\nWandering and feasting in the Azure Vastness Palace.\nColored clouds entwine the cinnabar haze,\nDivine mists scatter through the eight voids.\nThe Perfected on high chant in the jade chamber,\nLofty immortals sing in the gemstone hall.\nNine phoenixes intone the vermilion flute,\nHollow pipes harmonize with feathered bells.\nNeck to neck within the Golden Court,\nWe bind our bonds as friends in the unseen.\nTogether we sip the jade nectar’s flow—\nYet already the blackened flame clings to the child.\nHow can one crouch in the path’s midst?\nIlls and transgressions swell with each passing day.\n\n**On the night of the ninth day of the second month, Cloud Forest composed.**\n\nAt dawn I roam the Palace of Great Simplicity,\nGoverning the gaze upon the Jade River.\nAt dusk I feast in the Resplendent Lofty Abode,\nAt morn I pluck the round radiance’s bloom.\nI pluck the jade zither at the Northern Cold Terrace,\nSeven spirits gleam in the purple haze.\nSolemnly the lofty immortals rise,\nScattered like dust amid the worldly snare.\nLingering within the clamor and mist,\nTransgressions and burdens ought not be many.\n\n**On the sixteenth day of the second month, Lady Youying composed.**\n\nThe Dark Clarity’s distant gaze,\nThe setting light emerges from the eastern stillness.\nWould that I might find a friend beyond the dust,\nLiving in rare seclusion, far from the world’s din.\nI chant this again and again.\n\n---\n\n**The following three passages were written by Yang:**\n\nThe numinous ones conceal themselves on the Mystic Peak,\nTrue spirits veil their cloud-borne radiance.\nThe dark chant is not without its time,\nThe wondrous response awaits its moment.\nWho would say the void is silent?\nThe supreme resonance endures forever.\nHand in hand we ascend the Feathered Palace,\nFeasting together in the Vast Cold’s halls.\nI ask: who are these companions?\nOnly the jade youths remain.\nThe soaring clouds, the void’s steed—\nThey rise with pinions aloft in the empty sky.\nSuch men—how could they not long bow to the south,\nForever renouncing the thousand chariots?\n\n**Purple Tenuity’s poem.**\n\nUpon chanting this:\nI harness the wind, I gallop the clouds,\nAt dawn I ascend the Great Stillness’s mound.\nThe crimson ford shakes the linked peaks,\nClear waves surge through the deep currents.\nI pace the void, observing the nine wefts.\n\nThe Eight *Gang* [Principles]—*Yunji Qiqian*, Scroll 98, records that Cloud-Forest Right Radiance Lady {orally transmitted} to Yang the Perfected One, who composed this poem for Director Xu. All have already roamed:\nFor a brief respite, they feast amid the Three Gold Splendors,\nComing to observe the companions of steadfast resolve.\nDiligent or idle, they do not linger.\nThus, a hundred sorrows accumulate.\n\nOn the night of the thirtieth day of the second month, Right Radiance composed:\nCold robes ford the Green River,\nAnd so they meet Lord Fusang.\nA grand assembly at the Great Forest’s ruins,\nResting and feasting in the Dark Flower Palace.\nIf one’s faith in the Dao is truly pure and sincere,\nWhy not dwell upon the Eastern Peak?\n\nPurple Tenuity Lady chants this:\nCrossing waves, traversing the azure vast,\nSuddenly they arrive at Golden Mountain.\nGazing all around, they wander the whole day—\nRare are we, the cloud-borne ones.\n\nRight Radiance intones this:\nGuiding the light, they reach the Dawn Ford,\nRiding the whirlwind to ascend the Supreme Clarity.\nCloud Terraces rise in towering majesty,\n{Gates flourish} enclosing the jade-walled city.\nMorning winds stir the cinnabar mists,\nCrimson vapors scatter across the golden courts.\nGreen blossoms gleam on the dark peaks,\nPurple haze arises beneath the cliffs.\nAuspicious clouds coil around the cinnabar furnace,\nRefined jade scatters as eightfold jasper.\nReclining, they gaze upon the Vast Cold Palace,\nWhere ten thousand *chun* trees restore youth.\nDragon {banners} unfurl with numinous lightning,\nTiger standards summon the crimson hosts.\nLofty perfected ones circle the Nine Luminaries,\nTheir penetrating vision equal to the hidden and manifest.\nWho can tread the secluded path,\nAnd seek my boundless years?\n\nPurple Tenuity Lady composes:\nPurple towers are built atop the void,\nDark halls surge with the rushing gale.\nJade and pearl adorn the numinous gardens,\nBlossoms bloom, entwining with jasper.\nThey gallop the ford of the azure vast,\nEight winds stir the cloud-borne melodies.\nParting the feathered fans of the northern shade,\nGrasping the staff, they sound the golden flutes.\nPhoenix pipes harmonize with a thousand bells,\nWestern youths sing at dawn’s audience.\nThe heart opens beyond the void’s outer bounds,\nThe spirit’s lapel—how vast and bright!\nTurning {to dance} upon the Great Void’s ridge,\nThe Six Qi govern the profound and obscure.\nHow could my path be found?\n\nRight Elegance Lady composes:\nMists veil the Purple Tenuity’s halls,\nLofty terraces disperse the radiant gale.\nLuan birds sing amid the flowered canopy,\nPhoenix hooks guide the dragon’s {chariot-summons}.\nEight wolves bear crimson banners,\nWhite tigers blow horned flutes.\nClouds surge, depicting the numinous palace,\nComing to this dust-choked clamor.\nLoosening the reins where the fair one slumbers,\nTogether they summon one another.\nSeeking the lineage takes but a moment,\nTen thousand years—yet a single dawn.\nThe cedar’s span meets its decline,\nHow could kalpas past be deemed distant?\nThe true gaze upon one another,\nLest the heart’s course {wither}.\nThe empty blade swings to the void’s end,\nCoarse stagnation saddens the Five Spirits.\n\nRight Purple Tenuity composes:\nAt dawn, the eastern morning’s radiance unfolds,\nSoaring across the azure abyss.\nMountain waves shake the green shores,\nEight winds fan the dark mist.\nGlancing back, the shifting chambers change,\nLonging stirs the true and

through the Six Voids,\nThoughts turn to roaming with the fair one.\nExquisite songs find no response from me,\nTo whom may the pure tones be cast?\nAmid clouds, jade wheels gallop—\nWhy hasten through the dust’s throng?\n\nRight Elegance Lady chants this song at the same evening:\nPines and cypresses grow on the dark peak,\nThriving as the cold forest’s towering trees.\n{Luxuriant} blossoms flourish amid stern ice,\nUnwilling to fear the white snow.\nIn troubled times, the deep and layered ravines.\n\nWandering life keeps the Dao ever pure,\nThis soaring carriage leaves swift tracks

noble and far-reaching,\nThus they flourish with surpassing distinction.\nDelighting in those Eight Pristine Brushes,\nThe Dao’s completion was never distant.\nHow can worldly affairs be foreseen?\nThey would but dissolve your form and qi.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-seventh day of the fourth month,\nSouthern Marchmount Lady composes.\n\nTwelve pieces bear Yang’s calligraphy,\nwith additional transcriptions by various scribes.\n\nPure and still, I vow for Eastern Mountain,\nShaded by radiance, I dwell in the numinous grotto.\nThe heart’s echoes resound in the tranquil courtyard,\nCanopies of verdant forests grow dense.\nCircular brilliance illumines the southern casement,\nCrimson phoenixes fan the secluded chamber.\nSleeves clasped within the quiet room,\nWe

month,\nRight Elegance Lady composes,\naddressed to Director Xu.\n(Note: In the Jin calendar, the intercalary month of the bingyin year was the fourth month.)\n\nThese bear Yang’s calligraphy,\nwith additional transcriptions by scribes.\n\nReleasing the heart to the empty confluence of waters,\nReining the crimson steeds—\nWhy does the fair one come so late?\nWhen will the Dao and virtue be achieved?\n\n(Chanting this Dao verse:)\nIf you truly intend to follow the Master’s axe,\nThen you should gather the five zhi herbs.\nEven if the zhi herbs cannot be found,\nYou still cannot come.\nIf you come, then you may obtain them—\nThe zhi herbs shall be yours to eat.\n\n(These lines of “obtain” and “come” are playful, rendered in Wu dialect.)\n\nRight Elegance Lady chants this.\n\nTwo pieces bear Yang’s calligraphy.\n\nThe Eight Paths converge without a single origin,\nRiding fate, I observe the clamor of the world.\nTransformed amid the floating dust,\nLoosening my robe, I join the Daoist family.\nSwift as mist, yet uncollapsed,\nI carry the true to the numinous heights.\nEmpty radiance coils through the jasper pavilion,\nThe dark harmony composes the phoenix’s song.\nThe road is smooth, without hindrance,\nNuminous tones dance upon cloud-waves.\nVirtues aligned, they flourish in Jade Capital—\nWhat need is there for the world’s excess?\n\nThe transmission of the text complete,\nShe chants again.\nAfter a long while, she once more bestows this poem,\nSeeming unconnected to what was written above.\n\nSerene, I observe the celestial truth,\nShedding burdens, I release all passions.\nThe body stills, the mechanism of the four steeds abandoned,\nExalting being, I thus preserve life.\nWhere might I find the Master of Equanimity,\nTo entrust fate and follow wherever it leads?\n\nComposed by the Lady of the Central Watchtower.\n\nA fleeting feast beneath the dust-laden winds,\nVicissitudes trace their return.\nHow could one know the span of the kalpa’s turning?\nA glance back stirs sorrow in the heart.\n\nComposed by the Lady of the Purple Tenuity.\n\nThese three pieces bear Yuan’s calligraphy.\n\nThe forest stirs with kindred resonance,\nClouds gather, awaiting the dragon’s song.\nMysterious numbers seek one another,\nEvery touch of rhythm bears its own sound.\nFlying forth from Western Florescence,\nReins gathered, they suddenly come in search.\nThough the Eight Distances hold no lack of joy,\nIn shared chanting, the principle itself commands reverence.\nMourning those within the Four Nets,\nA hundred sorrows ever dwell in the heart.\nTogether we roam the Northern Frigid Terrace,\nA divine wind unfastens your robe.\n\nComposed by the Lady of the Southern Culmen on the night of the twenty-third day of the sixth month.\n\nAscending to Eastern Florescence,\nFanning the dance of the Great Mystery,\nFlying reins soar ninety thousand,\nThe Eight Falls now made equal.\nA moment’s gaze upon the rivers and mountains,\nIn the depths of the numinous peaks.\nOf one wind, our qi naturally aligns,\nIn Dao’s harmony, the principle draws near.\nDragon zhi herbs grant boundless longevity,\nInward vision gathers the celestial truth.\n\nAt Eastern *Cen* (corrected to 岑, meaning \"peak\"), one may forever purify—\nWhy then be entangled by things?\n\nComposed by the Lady of the Central Watch on the night of the twenty-third day of the sixth month.\n\n*(The two preceding poems bear Yang’s calligraphy, later transcribed by Yuan. On the twelfth day of the fifth month, Zhongjun Yu inscribed these words. [This nine-character note appears outside the scroll. All that follows seems to have been conferred in the *dingmao* year, concerning the division of the Three Xu.] )*\n\nAh Ying thus resolved to renounce the world, dwelling in mountains and forests,\nDiligently cultivating the savor of the Dao,\nPurifying his spirit and focusing his essence,\nPolishing the mirror of emptiness to clarity.\nIn solitary serenity, he rejoiced in the profound,\nAlone yet abiding in union with the true.\nHe was a peer of Naiweng, master of distant Dao,\nAnd a companion to Jiang Bozhen.\nConsuming the *ye* elixir,\nHe ultimately reaped its benefits—\nA matter of utmost consequence.\n\nFormerly, he also entered the Red Mountain of Linhai,\nRed Mountain also called Burning Mountain,\nWhere he encountered worthy companions:\nWang Shilong,\nZhao Daoxuan,\nAnd Fu Taichu.\n\nThese several individuals had initially crossed the river in the first year of *Jianxing* of the Jin, entering the Eastern Mountains to study the Dao. They all met one another there. The practices of these several men all surpassed Ying’s. Ying thus became a disciple of Shilong, receiving the Dao of untying the bonds and cultivating the methods of reverse practice. He ingested the Jade Fluid, refined the essence of the brain, and within two or three years, his face radiated luminous splendor, his complexion reverted to youth, and he attained the utmost in Daoist accomplishment. Yet he regretted that his endowment was not abundant, preventing him from achieving the highest rank of transcendence.\n\nThereupon, the Director of Destinies commanded me to recommend him, submitting a memorial to the Upper Palace. His name was transferred to the Registers of the Eastern Direction, and he was appointed an Earthbound Transcendent. At that time, the Left Minister of the Three Offices’ General Prohibition dispatched the Keeper of the Handle, Hou Zhou Fang, and the Envoy of the Unorthodox, Yan Baihu, to the Red Mountain, intending to seize him and take him away, interrogating him regarding his transgressions. I was then struck dumb (the character likely should be *ya*, \"astonished\"). I swiftly sent an urgent report to the Director of Destinies, who immediately dispatched the Central Attendant Li Zun, wielding a fire-bell, to come and rebuke them. Thereupon, Fang and Baihu fled.\n\nBefore Li Zun’s arrival, Ying was terrified, his courage failing, and his *qi* dissipated.\n\nAlso relying on the youthful integrity of Li Kailin, styled Longgong, who assisted Ying in his responses—had it not been for these two and their master Wang Shilong, matters would have long since turned dire. Though Fang’s interrogation was grounded in truth, Ying’s replies were barely adequate.\n\nThe Three Offices produced vermilion tablets inscribed with the register of transgressions, each holding one copy as they questioned Ying, saying: \"One who aspires to the Dao and yearns for life, who submits to the Perfected Ones above and nests their profound heart in reverent sincerity, who venerates the lofty numina—such a one ought to have worldly merits to their credit, misfortunes and evils unmet, hidden virtue spreading its roots, and a benevolent heart reaching upward. Only then may they tread the path to transcendence and have their name inscribed in the Azure Bureau. How then did your father’s hand slay Xie Gong? Moreover, you threw the Three Luminaries into chaos. You further promised to behead Li Yiji in the morning to substitute for Cai Fu’s rank. You fled to slay and shoot Pan Qisi and others, dismembered your retainer Cao Biao, drowned Tang Yun’s corpse in water, burned Xu Ang’s bones in fire, strangled Huan Zheng, carved up Zhen Hui, and committed cruel, violent, and wanton atrocities against forty-three souls. Their clamorous grievances now lie before the Celestial Thearch.\"\n\nPiled high as mountains are your calamitous transgressions,\nnot a single meritorious deed to your name.\nMoreover, you originally belonged to the Way of the Bo Clan,\nyet feasted on the blood of living folk—\nlong-standing offenses and karmic debts\nwere already listed in the registers of the Three Bureaus.\nYet you presumptuously slipped through the net,\nserving as a bondsman to the true qi.\nFather and son, a single household,\neach pledged to different masters,\nliving in discord,\nnever sharing the same libation wine.\nSuch grievous guilt\nis now under dark scrutiny.\nWith sins so amassed,\nhow could you ever attain transcendence?\nHow dare you deceive the courts of the Most High,\nhoping to have your name inscribed in the Purple Register of Immortality?\nYou have no defense.\nThe authorities will surely seize you.\n\nThereupon, he drew himself up, let out a long howl,\nshook his coarse robe, and ran his fingers through his hair.\nThen, composing his breath and sealing his lips,\nhe roared in reply:\n“The Great Dao shows no partiality,\nbut befriends only the good.\nHeaven and Earth have no intent,\nyet mercy follows virtue.\nThus at Banquan, blood flowed in rivers,\nyet the Dragon-Beard’s uprising met no resistance.\nThe Three Miao dyed the wilds crimson,\nand the deer fled through the scarlet grass—\ndid this hinder the lofty communion of the Great Sage’s numinous transformations?\nMy seven-times-great father was Xu Zia.\"\n\n\"Accumulating benevolence and manifesting virtue,\nhe harmonized yin with birds and beasts.\nWhen years of famine came,\nthe people starved,\nand pestilence struck,\nleaving but one in a hundred alive,\nhe then distributed his family’s wealth\nto rescue the multitudes.\nHe personally prepared remedies,\nlaboring tirelessly in the outer lodgings.\nAt another’s funeral,\nhe grieved as if he had lost his own kin;\nin relieving another’s suffering,\nhe agonized as if it were his own affliction.\nLives already lost\nhung by a thread in his hands;\nthe destitute and dying\nhe cradled as his own children.\nThose who survived the calamity,\nrelying on him to endure—\nfour hundred and eight souls.\nHis benevolence and virtue never faltered,\nand later, they would be bestowed upon us.\nThus his merit was inscribed before the Celestial Emperor,\nhis virtue etched in the Numinous Pavilion,\ncausing our ancestral roots to flow with generational blessings,\nour lineage to radiate with luminous posterity.\nHence the branches droop with blossoms,\nand from birth, we have loved the immortal arts.\nFive of us were destined for transcendence,\nthree have already ascended.\nOur names are recorded in the Most High’s register,\nour deeds chronicled in the Azure Palace’s annals—\nhow could the likes of you presume to share in this?\" He finished speaking.\n\nThe *fang* and his companions burst into laughter, and Zun departed. Though this intention was indeed aided by Shi Long of the world, I also admired his bold words.\n\nThereupon, they were granted transcendence and recorded in the Eastern Palace, destined to become middling immortals. Yet within their bodies lingered unresolved karmic debts from past lives, which they would gradually atone for and resolve before the Most High. They were to receive scriptures and official appointments—no longer subject to the trials of the Three Bureaus, their names already fixed in the register of the deathless.\n\nNow they have been relocated to Zhuye Mountain, also called Gaizhu Mountain. On its eastern face, two ridges rise to the west. Between them lies a stone bridge over a well. North of the bridge, a narrow path leads inward. There stand six clusters of cedar trees; within three hundred paces to their left and right is a deep stone chamber. Before it flows a spring, where Ying and three others now dwell.\n\nIn the *chen* year, they will briefly emerge to partake of mortal food and visit their native mountains near their hometowns, allowing their families and brothers to see them. At that time, they will inform their younger brothers of their whereabouts. They also send word to their disciples, urging diligence: if one seeks Ying at Zhuye Mountain, they may yet meet him. Ascend the eastern stone bridge of Zhuye Mountain; north of the bridge, the path is smooth and easy. Do not take the southern route up the mountain, for it is perilously steep.\n\nAmong the immortals of Zhuye Mountain are Chen Zhonglin, Xu Daoju, Yin Linzi, and Zhao Shudao—all of whom entered this mountain at the end of the Han. Shudao has already attained the rank of Lesser Perfected One. Zhonglin has just passed his great trial and will soon depart. These are the elder immortals of Zhuye Mountain.\n\nAs for Wang Shilong, Zhao Daoxuan, Fu Taichu, and Xu Ying (also called Xu Yuanyou), they arrived only four years ago. The record from the twelfth day of the fifth month to this point is based on Yang’s transcription of the imperial decree.\n\nThe venerable ones, resplendent in inner radiance, have cast off their former burdens and are no longer their old selves. Through purification and refinement, they have attained the essence of the Dao. Their spirits harmonize with their hearts, gazing up at the numinous clouds, beholding the dawn’s splendor. Their virtuous voices are as fragrant as orchids, and in another decade, they shall reach perfection.\n\nJì [note: should be written as 伟]举 was his given name. In all matters, he must be exhorted to diligence and never again be remiss. In the second year of the Taihe era, the year *dingmao* (47), on the seventeenth night of the twelfth month, the Supreme Perfection True Person, Lord of Destiny, addressed Mu:\n\nBy the year *bingzi*, a decade will have passed. At that time, he shall be seventy-two. By the years *haizi* and *zi*, his spirit will undergo transformation and refinement. In the *zi* year, ten years will remain. Like an axe laid aside in desolation, his heart shall harmonize and congeal in stillness. Though the Dao is subtle, riding it brings order. His form shall settle in the cinnabar void, his banner raised to the celestial ridge. His spirit shall shine with radiance, his light grow ever more luminous. Truly, this is the lofty ascension of the dawn’s attendant, the celestial array of Master Gu’s tripod [note: ancient form of 鼎]. One may call him a talent surpassing all expectations, a transcendent of profound and serene cultivation.\n\nHe must further exert himself in cultivating virtue and refining his practice, abiding in tranquil emptiness. On the seventeenth night of the twelfth month, the Supreme Perfection True Person, Lord of Destiny, addressed the Jade Axe.\n\n[He declined an appointment as a recruited aide in the office of the Minister of Education and instead withdrew to Maoshan in his home county for five years.]\n\nThis sixteen-character annotation was added later by Rong’s younger brother. (The public office recruitment appears to be mistaken.)\n\nProfound and wondrous, he embodied the Dao;\nUnraveled mysteries and attained essence.\nEmptiness within received all things;\nGentle virtue followed constancy.\nCompassionate, magnanimous, and broadly learned,\nHe heard the Dao and put it into practice.\nWandering free, his steps took flight,\nOpening sincerity with candor and equanimity.\nUrging the dragon to ascend,\nHe drifted through mist to the Three Clarities.\nTruly the leader of perfected transcendents,\nA master among the elders of his village.\nHe was destined to govern a sacred domain,\nTo guard the immortal capital as its count.\nAssisting the highest virtue,\nHis name was inscribed in crimson registers.\n\nThe above describes the allotted destiny received by Director Xu of the Bureau of Merit.\n\n(At that time, Protector-General and Director of the Bureau of Merit—these six characters were also added by Rong’s younger brother.)\n\nJade brilliance blazed with pure radiance,\nConcealed light veiled the true.\nThe two luminaries descended upon the blade,\nFlying auroras trailed in coils.\nThus the Jade Youth\nGathered these twin celestial bodies.\nThereby he opened the supreme Dao,\nRightly attaining the wondrous gate.\nHis demeanor shone with jade-like splendor,\nHis jade standard gleamed with dark gold.\nHis name ascended to the Five Palaces,\nHis record hung among the Seven Primes.\nTruly he was among the paired domains’ array,\nA minister of the Upper Clarity.\nThis arose from the child’s inner harmony, his resonance with emptiness, and his single-minded devotion to truth—\nAlso from the southerners’ certain harnessing of the cloud-chariot,\nAnd the Three Primes’ luminous carriage bearing him on their excursions.\n\n(This “paired domain” refers to Master Gu Xi, the same as the earlier “Master Gu’s celestial array of the tripod.”)\n\nThe above describes the allotted destiny received by Jade Axe.\n\n(In the preceding two instances of “the above,” the word “said” appears below. From Director’s book: “The above was spoken by the Pure Numinous Perfected…” Yang’s text omits these four characters, likely because Yang conveyed it orally to Director—this being Director Pei.)\n\nThis marks the moment of Dao attainment through diligent effort, the time of receiving the scriptures—the initial names determined and set forth. It also signifies the allotted destiny of attaining the Dao and being entrusted with its transmission.\n\nThose who 〈rely〉 and then abandon it will find no path forward.\nWe must together 〈cherish〉 this.\n\nThe above five entries were transcribed by Director from Yang’s manuscript in two copies.\n\nThe *Scripture of Preserving Life* states: “Master Xu was thus able to entrust his form to the hidden transformation—his nocturnal liberation following Lord Zhang of Zhen’nan. Thereby he nurtured his hun-soul in the Grand Yin, concealed his po-soul within the earth, with the Four Numinous Ones guarding his essence and the Five Elders preserving his store. After sixteen years, he nearly beheld me in the Eastern Flower. Once attaining the hidden and unobstructed, none perceived him as unreal.”\n\n(Master Xu here refers to the Attendant. According to records, Master Zhang served as General Zhen’nan and died in the twenty-first year of Jian’an. Buried east of Ye, forty-four years later—during the fourth year of Ganlu in Wei—his water-sealed coffin opened, revealing a body as if alive. It was lifted onto a bed, whereupon he raised a fly-whisk to cover his face, laughed loudly, and died again, necessitating reburial. External accounts describe the event thus, though the method of nocturnal liberation remains unclear. In Master Xu’s case, it appears not to have involved sword or staff.)\n\nThe above was spoken by Perfected Ying: “From antiquity to the present, life and death possess their ford; the manifest and the hidden meet differently. Concealing the past and extinguishing knowledge—those who align with the world in this—all practice the conduct of Dao attainment. As for those who ride the jade elixir once, make the ninefold blossoms take flight thrice, revel in cloud-liquor at dawn, or wander amidst flowing yellow; who swallow golden nectar and chew jade sprouts—these ascend at once, riding the light into the void, darkly ascending to the Supreme Subtlety. Yet when worldly affairs stray from the mysterious, and this work remains unfinished, one ought to tread the Grand Yin for a time, conceal life in the hidden realm, and cast off the outer form, discarding the bodily husk.”\n\nWithin the empty dwelling of nurturing the embryo, the kiln of qi is sealed, and the furnace’s key is cut off. Receiving the essence in the profound vastness, one thus transforms their countenance within the halls of the Three Yin and gains a youthful visage at the gate of the Ninefold Refinement. Only then does one know that the divine immortals are wondrous—dying yet not perishing. The matters of departure and return are principles profound indeed.\n\nThe Southerners say: those who attain the Dao and depart this world may appear or conceal themselves, entrusting their form and leaving traces behind—this is the Dao’s concealment. Yet some, after once more reveling in jade essence, knock upon their coffins; or with a single dose of the elixir’s measure, their corpses decay. The Deer-Skin Elder swallowed jade blossoms, and maggots streamed from his door; Qiu Jizi imbibed golden liquor, and the stench spread for a hundred li. The Yellow Emperor fired the Nine Cauldrons at Mount Jing, yet still left behind a tomb with a bridge’s collar. Ji Zhu consumed cloud powder to ascend in concealment, yet his head and feet lay apart. Mo Di swallowed rainbow cinnabar and cast himself into the waters. Ning Sheng took stone-brain and leapt into fire. Wu Guang cut leeks and entered the limpid, frigid abyss. Bo Cheng inhaled qi until his intestines and stomach rotted thrice. Such cases are too numerous to record in full—how subtle indeed!\n\nThe traces of those who attain the Dao—whether they embrace or abandon it—are ever inconstant. (The \"Southern One\" refers to the Lady of the South. These transcendents appear in various records, yet their deeds and traces vary, sometimes conflicting.)\n\n*Preserving Life* further states: Once one has attained the subtle and unobstructed, none perceive their unreality. Such indications reveal not a true corpse.\n\nThe following four entries are recorded in the hand of the Prefect:\nWhen a person dies, one must examine their form. If they appear as in life, it is *shijie* (corpse liberation). If the feet are not discolored and the skin remains unwrinkled, it is also *shijie*. If the eyes remain undamaged, indistinguishable from a living person, it is likewise *shijie*. If the hair falls out entirely yet the bones lose their form, it is still *shijie*. Those who achieve *shijie* in broad daylight are transcendents, not subject to the usual examples of *shijie*.\n\nThe following entry is transcribed in Jia’s hand:\nIf one temporarily dies and enters the Great Yin, passing provisionally through the Three Bureaus, the flesh may turn to ash and decay, the blood settle, and the pulses disperse—yet the five viscera continue to live. The white bones become jade-like, the seven *po* spirits attend, the three *hun* souls guard the dwelling, the Three Primes suspend their breath, and the great spirit seals itself within. After thirty or twenty years, or ten or three years, one emerges at will. Upon reviving, the blood is gathered anew, flesh nurtured, fluids generated, and form reconstituted—surpassing even one’s appearance before death. This is what is meant by \"the perfected refining their form in the Great Yin and transforming their countenance in the Three Bureaus.\"\n\nSo says the Heavenly Emperor.\n\nThe refinement of form in the Great Yin surpasses the consumption of nine-times-cycled elixirs. The visage becomes upright and solemn, the complexion like numinous clouds. Ascending to the Gate of the Supreme Ultimate, one receives the scriptures and is named a Perfected.\n\nAfter five or six years following Zhao Chengzi’s death, travelers passing the mountain at dusk saw his corpse within a stone chamber—flesh decayed, bones remaining. Yet within his abdomen, the five viscera persisted as before, fluids and blood entwined within, purple wrappings and networks bound without.\n\nThose adepts of the Dao who temporarily wander the Great Yin—Taiyi guards their corpse, the three *hun* souls tend the bones, the seven *po* spirits protect the flesh, and the embryonic spirit records the qi.\n\n---\n\nThe preceding three entries were copied by the Prefectural Secretary from the *Nine Perfected Scripture*, detailing the consumption of the Five Mineral Riches. Those who achieve liberation through the corpse by means of other medicines—not through the transformation of numinous pills—are unable to return to their native land, for the Three Bureaus seize them.\n\nSome die and revive again. Some, though decapitated and dead, emerge from another side. Some lose their corpse before burial. Some retain their form but are without bones. Some leave their clothing behind as their form departs. Some shed their hair and vanish. Those who depart in broad daylight are called \"upper corpse liberation\"; those who depart at midnight, \"lower corpse liberation.\" Those who depart at dawn or dusk are called \"earthly lords.\"\n\n---\n\nThe preceding entry was copied by the Secretary from the *Sword Scripture*, discussing matters of corpse liberation.\n\n*True Records*, Scroll Four.\n*True Records*, Scroll Five.\n\n**Initiation into Destiny and Transmission of the Dao, Chapter One**\n\nThe Dao is transmitted.\n\n*(This section was copied by both the Chief Clerk and the Secretary, with the title as given. It is unclear whether this is an ancient Daoist text or a revelation delivered during Yang’s descent. Its principles align perfectly with the true scriptures, and it is suspected to be the teaching of Master Pei. The reason for this is as follows: According to the *Scripture of Treasuring the Spirit*, the Dao states, \"My master is the Red Pine of the Southern Marchmount.\" Moreover, the practices of the bedchamber were only received and cultivated by Master Pei in his youth. The *True Records* contain the words, \"I once regretted that this [understanding] came too late.\" This phrase also seems to echo the speech of the pure and numinous.)*\n\nThe Master said:\nThe Dao is the undifferentiated origin of life. When the origin is perfected, then the Supreme Ultimate arises. The Supreme Ultimate is the parent of Heaven and Earth, the mystery of the Dao. Thus, the Dao has a great return—this is called Pristine Reality. Without the Dao, reality cannot be perfected; without reality, the Dao cannot be fulfilled. If the Dao is not fulfilled, how can its pristine nature be perceived? Therefore, it is called the great return. Perceived, it is called the Wondrous; fulfilled, it is called the Dao; put into practice, it is called nature. Nature and the Dao share the same essence. The essence delights in the perfect Dao, for the Dao causes it to be so.\n\n*(This explains that the human body naturally harmonizes with the Dao. Thus, Heaven’s mandate is called nature; following nature is called the Dao; cultivating the Dao is called teaching. Now, using the Dao to teach and refine nature into reality is to become one with the Dao.)*\n\nThe Master said:\nThe Most High is the descendant of the Dao, who discerns the Dao’s root and penetrates the Dao’s foundation. Thus, they are the Perfected of the Highest Clarity and the teacher of the Old Lord.\n\n*(This refers to the Most High, the August and Numinous, the Great Dao Lord of the Jade Dawn, who is the teacher of the Left Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate and the Central Yellow Old Lord.)*\n\nThe Master said:\nThe Old Lord is the disciple of the Most High. At the age of seven, he grasped the essentials of longevity. Thus, he is the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe Supreme Ultimate has four Perfected. The Old Lord resides on its left, bearing the talisman of the divine tiger, girded with golden bells, holding the purple-feathered staff, and wearing the headscarf of golden essence. When he travels, he is attended by the canopy of flowering dawn and rides the cloud of the Three Primes.\n\n*(These two passages are drawn from the *Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, discussing the Central Yellow Old Lord. The Yellow Old Lord is the teacher of the Perfected of the Grand Void and the Red Lord of the Southern Marchmount. Since Master Pei studied under the Red Lord, he revered his origin and expounded upon his rank and virtue.)*\n\nThe Master said:\n\nThe Way possesses the *Eightfold Pure Scripture of the True*, the hidden writings of the Supreme Lord. In the world, the Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, the secret teachings of the Old Lord. In the world, the Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *Supreme Clarity’s Scripture of Seventy-Four Methods of Transformation*. The Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *Texts for Eliminating the Six Heavens and the Three Heavens’ Orthodox Dharma*. In the world, the Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *Yellow Qi and Yang Essence: The Heavenly Treasury of the Hidden Moon*. The Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *Diagrams of the Three Primes’ Dispersed Scripture and the True Way*. The Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *Forty-Four Formulas of the Yellow Plain Divine Methods*. The Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *Essentials of Longevity from the Yellow Writ and the Red Realm*. The Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *Cinnabar Elixir, Golden Essence, Stone Radiance, and Water Mother*. The Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *Green Essentials, Purple Writings, and the Golden Root’s Multitudinous Texts*. The Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *True Formulas of Jade Clarity: The Three-Nine Pure Sayings*. The Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *Stone Essence and Golden Light: The Record of Concealed Radiance*. In the world, the Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *Eight Arts of the Hidden Earth: Elixir Radiance and Dao Essence*. The Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *White Tablets and Plain Bamboo Records of Attained Dao Names*. The Master said:\nThe Way possesses the *Purple Crossing, Blazing Light, and the Spirit Candle of Night Illumination*. The Master said:\nAll these are the scriptures of the Way.\n\nThe *Yellow Writings*—though many copies exist in the world—remain matters of the esoteric Way. (The Celestial Master adopted their names to propagate their teachings, with the essential purport largely unchanged, only expanding their methods. What is here called the *Yellow Writings and the Crimson Realm’s Three-One Scripture*, or the *Inner Truth of the Yellow and Crimson* as spoken by Master Juanzi, are not the same as those expounded by the Celestial Master of this age.)\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Scripture of the Seven Celestial Principles for Soaring Steps*. It exists in the world.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Scripture of the Seven Transformations and Divine Arts of the Seven Cycles*.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* in thirty-nine scrolls. It exists in the world.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Hidden Writings of the Great Elixir: Eight Refinements and Ten Resolutions*.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Three Celestial Charts of the Heavenly Pass and the Seven Stars’ Transference of Degrees*.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Central Records of the Nine Elixirs’ Transformations and Embryonic Essence*.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Nine Crimson Seals for Binding Mountains and Sinking Seas*.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor and the Concealed Mushroom of the Supreme Ultimate*.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Five Phases’ Secret Talismans for Summoning Souls and Beckoning Spirits*.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Formulas of the Crooked and Plain* for invoking the ghosts of the Six Heavens. It exists in the world.\n\nThe Master said:\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Yellow Water and Moon Essence*. Ingesting it transforms one into the moon.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Receding Water and Jade Essence*. Ingesting it transforms one into the sun.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Hard Ring Tree Seeds*. Ingesting them transforms one into clouds.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Verdant Reflection of Yang Water*. Ingesting it transforms one into stone.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Crimson Tree and White Seeds*. Ingesting them transforms one into jade.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Cinnabar Tree and Azure Fruits*. Ingesting them transforms one into yellow gold.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Langgan Jade-Stemmed Flower Elixir*. Ingesting it transforms one into a flying dragon.\n\nThe above seventeen entries are recorded in the *Numinous Writ of the Purple Texts*, all being transformations of the *Langgan Elixir*.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Nine-Cycled Divine Elixir*. Ingesting it transforms one into a white crane. (Recorded in the *Transmission of Lord Mao of Destiny*)\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Celestial August Symbolic Talismans*, used to harmonize with the Primordial. These are also found in the *Purple Texts*.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *White Feathers and Purple Canopy*, used to wander the Five Peaks.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns*, used to summon the spirits of heaven and earth. (Though extant in the world, these are not the true versions)\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Jade Pendants and Golden Bells*, used to ascend the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Divine Tiger Talismans*, used to overawe the Six Heavens.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Flowing Gold Bells*, used to subdue ghosts and spirits.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Plain Memorials and Cinnabar Talismans*, used to summon the Six Jia.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance*, used to illuminate the world below.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Eightfold Scenic Chariot*, used to traverse the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Wings for Flight*, used to transcend the void and tread the skies.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Purple Embroidered Kerchief* and the *Vermilion Flying Scarf*.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *White Feathers and Black Plumes*, used to soar across the eight directions.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Kingfisher-Feather Robes, Golden Bells, and Azure Sashes*.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Curved Dawn Flying Canopy*. When mounted, the body naturally takes flight. (Recorded in the *Sword Classic*)\n\nThe immortal Dao possesses the *Thirty-Seven Colored Nodal Staffs*, bestowed upon the immortals.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe wonders of the immortal Dao all have their methods. One who fully masters this Way becomes a Perfected of the Nine Palaces—not merely ascending as an immortal. Yet the Dao’s methods are manifold; when each is fully prepared, this may be known. (This means that mastering even one strand of the Dao suffices to attain the rank of Perfected of the Nine Palaces. If all are fully possessed, one becomes a Perfected of the Great Ultimate.)\n\nThe Master said:\nNow that you have come to study the Dao with wholehearted devotion, I shall transmit the Way to you. Yet all learners must have a teacher. My own teacher was Master Pine of the Southern Marchmount, who served as Left Immortal Duke to the Perfected of the Great Void. Master Valley-Seeker served as Right Immortal Duke. In ancient times, the Most High instructed Laozi in virtue, enabling him to attain the Dao. Master Pine transmitted the Dao to me, enabling me to attain immortality. Now that I have received the Dao from Master Pine, if you wish to study it, he will surely test you. Should you fail the trial, it would bring shame upon me. Having now revealed to you the method of attaining the Dao and awakened you to the means of examination, if you still fail the trial, it would only reflect your own folly.\n\nThose who seek to test others devise trials from what lies beyond the reach of thought and beyond the grasp of emotion. Be vigilant, my disciple.\n\nThe Master said:\n\nThe Twelve Trials of Immortal Dao must all be passed before this scripture is conferred. These twelve matters are the great trials, all witnessed by the Perfected of the Great Ultimate. How could one not be vigilant?\n\nThe Master said:\nLong ago, Liu Weidao of Zhongshan, who studied the Dao of immortality on Mount Fan of the Zhong Mountains, spent twelve years there. An immortal tested him with a stone weighing one hundred thousand *jin*, suspended by a single white hair, and bade Weidao lie beneath it. Weidao’s countenance showed no change, his heart was at ease, and his body at peace as he lay beneath it for twelve years. The immortal tested him repeatedly, sparing no trial, yet Weidao awakened to them all. Thereupon, he was bestowed with divine elixir and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. (This man likely lived in the Han era.)\n\nThe Master said:\nLong ago, there was Lord Green Crow, who received the teachings of an enlightened master and thoroughly grasped the wondrous principles of immortality. He entered the Hua Mountains to study the Dao and spent four hundred seventy-one years there. Though he underwent the twelve trials, three remained unpassed. Later, he ingested golden *shuijiao* and ascended to the Great Ultimate. The Lord of the Dao of the Great Ultimate deemed that, having failed three trials, he was but an immortal and not a Perfected One—how much less could a worldly mind suffice?\n\nThe Master said:\nThe Dao of the Great Cavern is most refined and wondrous, being the scripture of the Guardian of Simplicity of the Non-Ultimate. None who recite it fail to ride clouds and mount dragons. In ancient times, the Yellow Lord of the Center concealed this scripture, and the world knew nothing of it. If you come to know it, guard it in secret and do not transmit it.\n\nMoreover, long ago, the three Zhou brothers, all fond of the Dao from youth, dwelled in the Chang Mountains for ninety-seven years. Their concentrated thought moved all things without fail.\n\nSuddenly, they beheld an old man, his head and beard snowy white. The three knew him to be a great spirit, and they kowtowed until their foreheads bled, tears and sobs mingling in overwhelming joy. They drew near to beg for the Dao. The old man then produced seven scrolls of plain silk scripture and bestowed them for recitation. The three brothers all studied them with utmost devotion.\n\nPresently, a white deer appeared at the mountain’s edge. The two younger brothers set aside their scrolls to watch it, but the eldest, Zhou Jun, never ceased his recitation. When the younger brothers returned, Zhou Jun had already surpassed them by seven thousand repetitions. Inwardly, the two wondered if the immortal had transformed into the white deer to call Zhou Jun away, but he paid no heed. Zhou Jun recited the scripture ten thousand times, while his brothers completed nine thousand seven hundred and thirty-three. Then Zhou Jun suddenly ascended as a flying immortal.\n\nThe two brothers took up the scrolls to recite them, but the stone chamber suddenly split with a burst of flame that consumed the texts. Thus, they failed to attain immortality and remain in the Chang Mountains to this day, traversing the Five Peaks on foot. Be cautious in this, disciple.\n\nThe Master said:\nLong ago, there was Zhuang Bowei, a man of the Han era. From youth, he was devoted to the Dao of long life. Each day at sunset, he faced the northwest, closed his eyes, clenched his fists, and visualized Mount Kunlun. After twenty-one years of such practice, he began to ingest elixirs.\n\nHaving entered Mount Zhong to study the Dao, he still practiced this method. After another ten or so years, when he closed his eyes, he suddenly beheld Mount Kunlun. Persisting in this visualization without cease, he eventually saw an immortal, who bestowed upon him the formula for the Golden {Water Ladle}. Thus, he attained the Dao. Yet this was merely the resonance of his essence with the Dao’s response, causing it to be so—not the subtlety of the technique itself.\n\nThe Master said:\nTrue persons conceal their Dao’s wonders while revealing their coarse forms. Some wear tattered robes and appear emaciated, their demeanor like that of fools. When others seek to learn the Dao, they test them in this way—yet in the end, none can recognize them. Those who fail to recognize them have not passed the trial. You must ever be cautious of this.\n\nLong ago, in the early Han, four or five children were playing by drawing on the road. One child sang:\n*\"Don the azure {lord’s kerchief} to enter Heaven’s Gate,\nBow to the Metal Mother, salute the Wood Lord.\"*\nThis, too, was a hidden saying. At the time, no one understood it—only Zhang Zifang knew. He went and paid homage to them. These were the Jade Lads of the Eastern King Father. The so-called Metal Mother is the Western Queen Mother, and the Wood Lord is the Eastern King Father. Immortals bow to the King Father and salute the Queen Mother.\n\nThe Master said:\nLong ago, there was Master Fu...\n\nIn his youth, he loved the Dao and entered a stone chamber on Mount Jiao. After seven years, the Supreme Ultimate Lord Lao visited him and gave him a wooden drill, instructing him to bore through a stone plate about five feet thick, saying, \"Once you pierce this plate, you shall attain the Dao.\" The man then drilled day and night. After forty-seven years, he bored through the stone and obtained the divine elixir. He ascended to the Great Clarity and became the Perfected One of the Southern Marchmount. This was a man of steadfast resolve—take note of this. If ever you face such a trial, be cautious never to say you cannot do it.\n\nThe Master said:\nLong ago, there was Huang Guanzi, who also loved the Dao from a young age. His family practiced both Buddhism and Daoism, and he paid homage morning after morning, kowtowing to pray for longevity. Thus he persisted for forty-nine years. Later, he ingested medicinal herbs and entered Mount Jiao. The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One tested him with one hundred and forty trials, all of which he passed. He then ingested the golden elixir and chanted the *Scripture of the Great Cavern*. Now he serves as an immortal official, the Left Immortal Minister of the Supreme Ultimate. He was a man of utmost resolve—Buddhism could not have achieved this. His mind was firmly settled within.\n\n(This account is similar to Fu Hanzhen’s devotion to Buddhism.)\n\nThe Master said:\nLong ago, Mao Bodao, Liu Daogong, Xie Zhijian, and Zhang Zhaoqi were all men of the Later Han. They studied the Dao together in the Wangwu Mountains for over forty years and jointly compounded the divine elixir. Mao Bodao ingested it first and died. Daogong ingested it next and also died. When Xie Zhijian and Zhang Zhaoqi saw this, they dared not ingest it.\n\nThey then abandoned the mountain and departed. Later, they saw Bodao and Daogong on the mountain. The two were shocked and grieved, then approached to seek the Dao. Bodao and Daogong gave them the method for preparing and consuming *fuling* (poria). After ingesting it, they both lived for several centuries. Even now, they remain in the mountains, wandering among the Five Peaks. These men understood the attainment of the Dao through the divine elixir, yet failed to realize that trials were inherent within it. Thus, they became only earthbound immortals, with no further hope of ascending to heaven.\n\n(There are three accounts of Xie Zhijian: one states he followed Ge Xuan; another places him in the Deer Track Grotto; and this is the third. It is unclear whether these refer to the same person or to individuals sharing the same name.)\n\nThe Master said:\nIn the early Jin dynasty, there was a perfected one, Guo Shengzi, who worked as a diviner in the Luoyang marketplace. At that time, the four clans—Liu, Shi, Zhang, and Zang—all wished to study the Dao. They often lamented, saying, \"We have not encountered an enlightened master. Even if such a master were to appear, we would remain unaware, and all would be trials we could not pass. Thus, we would gain nothing.\" One must always be cautious of this. If something extraordinary arises and one fails to recognize it, it becomes a trial one cannot pass.\n\nWhen a person harbors the intention to study the Dao, the heavenly net is vast yet never misses its mark—all are tested. You must deeply ponder this meaning and take heed. The Master said:\n\nThe Master said:\n\nIn ancient times, Lü Chengzi, from his youth, cherished the pursuit of longevity and delighted in studying the Dao. After more than forty years, he entered the Jing Mountains. Having lived there for over seventy years, he was tested by the mountain spirit of Jing Mountain. Chengzi mistook it for a perfected one and bowed, seeking the Dao—only to be devoured by a great serpent, nearly to the point of death. Fortunately, he awakened swiftly and preserved the visualization of the Seven Stars of the Supreme One to repel it, thereby escaping harm. Later, he was again deluded by malevolent spirits, losing his left eye. Thus, he failed to attain the Dao and perished in the mountains. You must be cautious of such trials and always remain with your master. This was due to Chengzi’s lack of single-minded devotion, as his heart harbored some impure intentions.\n\nThe Master said:\nHuang Ziyang was a man of Wei. From his youth, he understood the wonders of longevity. He studied the Dao in the Boluo Mountains for over ninety years, eating only peach bark and drinking the yellow water from stones. Later, he encountered Sima Jizhu, who transmitted to him the *Eight Directions of Daoist Immortality*, enabling him to transcend the world. (This refers to the Wei of the Warring States period, not the Wei dynasty after the Han.)\n\nThe Master said:\nThere was Liu Fenglin, a man of the Zhou dynasty, who studied the Dao on Mount Songgao. After four hundred years, he successfully compounded the divine elixir three times.\n\nDefeated by malevolent forces, he then moved to Mount Weiyu, where he could hold his breath for three days without respite. To this day, over a thousand years have passed, yet he has still not ascended as an immortal. This is because his trials were too numerous to overcome, and his mastery of the Daoist arts remains insufficient. This man merely consumes yellow lotus to attain undying life, yet he cannot command or employ any spiritual powers.\n\nThe Master said:\nLong ago, Gaoqiuzi was a man of Yin. He too was fond of the Dao and entered the Six Radiance Mountains. After accumulating five hundred and twenty years, he only studied the *Yellow Plain Scripture of the Dao* and ingested atractylodes. Later, he compounded the *Vast Elixir*, thereby attaining terrestrial immortality. He wandered among the Five Peaks for over two hundred years. Thereafter, he obtained the *Golden Liquid* and ascended to the Great Clarity, now serving as the Perfected One of the Central Peak. (This account closely resembles the preface to the *Sword Scripture*.)\n\nThe Master said:\nIn pursuing the Dao, one must ensure the Three Passes remain perpetually harmonized—this is the Way to root essence and strengthen the bones. The Three Passes are: the mouth as the Pass of the Heart, the feet as the Pass of Earth, and the hands as the Pass of Man. When the Three Passes are harmonized, the Five Viscera are at peace; when the Five Viscera are at peace, the entire body is free from illness.\n\nLong ago, Zhao Shuqi studied the Dao in the Wangwu Mountains. He would often emerge among the common folk and heard of a skilled diviner in the marketplace. Shuqi went to meet him. Thereupon, the diviner spoke to Shuqi, saying:\n\n\"To enter the Gate of Heaven, harmonize the Three Passes, visualize crimson robes, and align Kunlun. Shuqi knew this was a divine being and bowed in reverence, kowtowing to request the essential instructions. Thereupon, the being gave him a scroll—*The Record Within Embryonic Essence*. Having received this text with bows, he entered the mountains to recite it. Later, he compounded the divine elixir and ascended to heaven. These are all verifications of past events. You ought to remember these words. (The matter of the Three Passes is identical to that in the *Yellow Court*; though discussed, no method is given.)\n\nThe Master said:\nOne must visualize the Five Spirits within the body. The Five Spirits refer to the two hands, two feet, and the head. Envision the head as perpetually azure, the two hands as perpetually crimson, and the two feet as perpetually white—thus is one near to attaining transcendence. Long ago, Xu Jidao studied the Dao in the Huming Mountains. He, too, would often emerge among the common folk. Suddenly, he saw a man wearing leather trousers and a white silk robe, holding a peach-wood staff. He encountered Jidao, who remained unaware. This happened repeatedly. Jidao then realized and bowed in gratitude. Thereupon, the man spoke to Jidao, saying:\nTo study the Dao, one must don an azure headscarf, chant the *Great Calendar*, step with paired white [feet], and pace with two crimson [hands]. This pertains to the Five Spirits. His words were veiled.\nThe *Great Calendar* is the *Scripture of the Three Sovereigns*. (This is the matter of the Five Spirits of Primal Simplicity; separate scriptures and methods exist.)\n\nThe Master said:\"\n\n\"To rectify the heart-mind, one should, when the sun has risen three *zhang*, cross the hands upon the shoulders and align the sun with the heart. When warmth arises in the center of the heart-mind, the heart-mind is rectified. It is excellent to practice this regularly.\n\nLong ago, there was one named Jiang Bozhen who studied in the Meng Mountains. While cultivating the Dao and gathering herbs, he suddenly encountered an immortal. The immortal instructed him to stand upright at noon, but his shadow was askew. The immortal said: 'You know the value of the immortal’s Dao and are earnest in your study, yet you do not recognize that the failure lies in the heart-mind not being rectified.' Thereupon, he taught him this method. Later, Bozhen attained the Dao.\n\n(*Dinglu Mu* records that Master Xu said: 'Jiang Bozhen’s disciples do not know whether this Jiang is the same person.')\n\nThe Master said: At midnight, remove the pillow and lie flat, clench the fists and relax the body. When the qi is harmonized and subtle, the body and spirits are complete. If they are not complete, quickly rise, burn incense, sit upright, close the eyes, and clench the fists upon the knees. Focus the heart-mind on the spirits of the body, envisioning before the eyes a white [light] the size of a chicken’s egg. Thus, one returns to the original state. Practice this once every five days.\"\n\n(This pertains to the practices among the Twenty-Four Spirits.)\n\nThe Master said: Consuming herbs and plants without knowing the arts of the bedchamber and the practice of *daoyin* renders the medicine ineffective. One will never attain the Dao. Yet if one’s will is so sincere that it moves the numinous and the spirits are preserved, even herbs and plants are unnecessary. If one only knows the arts of the bedchamber and *daoyin* but does not know the method of the divine elixir, one will likewise not achieve immortality. If one obtains the golden [or \"water-ladle\"] divine elixir, no other techniques are required—one immediately becomes an immortal. If one obtains the *Scripture of the Great Cavern of Perfection*, even the way of the golden elixir is unnecessary. Recite it ten thousand times, and upon completion, one becomes an immortal.\n\nThe arts of the bedchamber and the practices of *daoyin* and circulating *qi* have their own classics in the world; they need not be reiterated here. (This means that merely consuming medicine and engaging in meditative cultivation while continuing conjugal relations will not lead to longevity. It does not mean one should abstain entirely—for even without such practices, those who consume medicine may still attain immortality.)\n\nThe scripture says: Those who attain the Dao all employ the method of starving the grain-devouring worms and perceive the techniques of the Three Corpses. When the grain-devouring worms die, the Three Corpses wither; when the Three Corpses wither, they naturally fall away. There are separate methods for killing the grain-devouring worms, which those who obtain them keep secret. (This refers to the *First Spirit Pill Formula* in the *Su Tradition*—other miscellaneous methods do not compare to it.)\n\nThe Master said:\n\nThose born into the world possess a destined record in the bones, and must harbor steadfast resolve—this is the Dao’s decree. Consider the likes of Master Qingguang, Gu Xizi, Master Song of Nanyue, Master Changli, and Moyu: all were befriended by the Supreme Pole Perfected or cherished by the Celestial Thearch on High, who summoned them with clouds and dragon-drawn chariots. Thus, though they did not cultivate the Dao, immortality came to them of its own accord. Yet for those below such rank, unwavering resolve is essential. (Note: These figures all had cultivation practices and deeds recorded in scriptures, enduring hardships before their attainment. To say they achieved transcendence without effort obscures the truth. *Moyu* may refer to *Moyu* [墨羽] or *Muyu* [木羽].)\n\nThe Master said: \"In cultivating the Dao, there are nine afflictions—each a grave malady of humankind. Should one discern these afflictions, immortality lies not far off. The nine afflictions are: having resolve but no opportunity; having opportunity but no companions; having companions but no resolve; having resolve but not meeting a teacher; meeting a teacher but not recognizing them; recognizing a teacher but not diligently following; diligently following but not upholding the Dao; or having resolve that is not firm; or being firm but not enduring. If one, from youth, cherishes the Dao and guards it with an unshakable heart—so that neither water nor fire can daunt their spirit, nor glory and splendor sway their resolve—and embraces authenticity while holding to simplicity, they will eventually encounter a teacher. Then they need not fear failure. Thus, one may attain success without companions and progress without external impetus. These are the essential and expansive teachings of immortal-cultivation. You should reflect upon them.\"\n\nThe Master said.\n\nThe Master said:\n\"Joy and anger harm resolve; sorrow and grief harm nature. Glory and splendor delude virtue; yin and yang deplete essence. These are the great taboos of Dao-cultivation and what immortal arts most abhor. Though one may practice essence-returning and embryonic breathing to merely replenish them, the inner void will already be thoroughly exhausted—this is still not one’s original truth. Better to know and yet not act, or act without dissipation. This is the essential Dao of immortality and the fundamental practice of life.\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\"To attain longevity, one should wash the face and purify the heart. When the sun has risen two zhang, face it directly. Exhale the dead [qi] through the mouth, and inhale the sun’s essence through the nose. When a sneeze arises, cease. This is called ‘penetration,’ and it replenishes essence and restores the embryo—a method for long life.\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\"In eating, take care not to overindulge, for excess breeds illness. After a full meal, take care not to lie down, for lying down unsettles the heart. An unsettled heart often loses its nature; overeating breeds illness. Illness renders medicine ineffective. For those who would cultivate the Dao, be vigilant about these matters before ingesting medicinal substances.\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\"The method of ritual regulation...\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\"This method sharpens the eyes. With prolonged practice, one gains penetrating vision. On the first day of the *jiazi* ten-day cycle, take clear east-flowing water and mix it with true cinnabar to wash the eyes. Face the pure brightness of dawn and perform this twice seven times daily. Consistent practice yields excellent results. (This practice originates from the Twenty-Four Spirits, where it is called *Futong*, and is performed at midday on the *gengwu* day.)\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\"For those who would cultivate the Dao, visualize the sun and moon in the eyes, let the ears resonate with the master’s voice, and constantly exhale dead *qi* while inhaling the living. Embody the five stars in form, walk as though treading empty space, and keep the heart fixed on long life. Be cautious with laughter and measured in speech. Always contemplate your form—this is the essential Dao.\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\"The method of the Seven and Five must always be preserved. The Five reside within the body; the Seven within the meridians.\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\"In the world, there are malevolent and fierce ghosts of the lower earth who often appear as women to delude and test people. If you encounter such beings, immediately close your eyes and visualize the *Tian Guan* star at the center of the celestial balance, along with the spirits of the body. Compose your expression, steady your will, and gaze intently at the core of the ritual.\"\n\nIf the pearl-like clarity in your vision dims and grows murky, it is a test by ghosts. When you recognize such a trial, visualize the Seven Stars before your face—or above your head—to repel them. If the light within the ritual’s core becomes square and radiant, it is a transcendent Daoist. Those who awaken will bow to them; those who fail remain untested. Yet to mistake the demonic for a true person is another form of failure. Be ever cautious. (For when the false and true intermingle, this is the most difficult test of all.)\n\nThe Master said:\n\"Do not abruptly cease eating—only gradually reduce your intake. Decrease by one *sheng* every ten days, and within half a year, you will have stopped entirely. There are methods for abstaining from grain, but as many in the world already know them, I will not repeat them here. People eat peaches to nourish the body, unaware that peach bark is even more potent. There are separate methods for using peach bark.\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\"When abstaining from grain and entering the mountains, one should consume white stone. Long ago, the Master of White Stone made stone his sustenance, and so the world called him the White Stone Immortal. He was a perfected being, now serving as the Left Immortal Minister of the Eastern Bureau. There are methods for consuming white stone. The *White Stone Method* was created by the White Stone Immortal himself. He was also skilled in the *Tai Su Transmission*, which speaks of the essence of white stone—hence his name, the White Stone Immortal.\" (This method exists in the world.)\n\nThe Master said:\n\nThe *Tai Su Transmission* is a Daoist text. Those who study it should revere the Most High Lord Lao and the Supreme Clarity Sovereign. This is the Way of luminous emptiness reflected within the radiance—it is not the most exalted of immortal teachings. It is what Laozi called the \"Spirit of the Valley.\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\"Wangwu Mountain is a celestial realm apart, known as the Terrace of Yang. All who first attain the Dao proceed to the Terrace of Yang. The Terrace of Yang is the Palace of Pure Emptiness. For those who wish to enter the mountains, this mountain is unrivaled. Below flows the Baoji River, and within its waters dwell stone essences. Those who obtain and consume them may attain longevity.\" (This mountain lies in Bishui County of Henan, the very source of the Ji River.)\n\nThe Master said:\n\"The Great Cavern is the Divine Continent. Within the Divine Continent are three mountains, and within these three mountains are seven palaces. The seven palaces undergo seven transformations: at dawn, they become gold; at midday, silver; at dusk, bronze; at night, light. Sometimes they transform into mountains, sometimes into water, sometimes into stone—these are the seven transformations. The seven transformations correspond to seven scriptures, and twenty-one jade lads accompany these texts. Thus, it is called the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*. Reading it ten thousand times bestows immortality. This is the supreme scripture of the immortal Dao.\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\nThe {Men Liang} Wilds are the abode of the {Men Liang} winds. Atop Kunlun lie nine palaces, which are the nine abodes. The Supreme Ultimate is the Great Palace. All immortals are but officials of the nine abodes (the character 辽 should be 僚), while perfected beings are the dukes, ministers, and grandees of the nine abodes. The ranks of immortal officials ascend and descend, each with its proper order. Among immortals, there are left and right bureaus, and within these, left and right dukes, left and right ministers, left and right grandees, and left and right censors. Those who master the *Great Cavern* become immortal ministers; those who ingest the golden elixir become grandees; those who consume the various fungi become censors. Should one obtain and consume the Hidden Fungus of the Supreme Ultimate, one becomes a left or right immortal duke or a perfected being.\n\nThe Master said:\n\"There are those who attain liberation through the corpse, and these are of several kinds, all within the reckoning of immortality. Yet corpse-liberated immortals may not ride the flowered canopy, mount the flying dragon, ascend the Supreme Ultimate, or wander the nine abodes.\" (This refers to those who naturally attain corpse-liberation, such as the rulers of the underworld, not those who employ transformation or concealment.)\n\nThe Master said:\n\nThe ninefold refinement of the Yang Elixir is a method all in the world possess—no need to expound it further. (This refers to the arts of the bedchamber; \"Yang Elixir\" may instead denote the \"Yin Elixir.\")\n\nThe Master said:\n\"While studying among men, one should only ingest medicines. If you do not cut off grains, the *Great Cavern* cannot be attained. Methods for cutting off grains exist in the world.\"\n\nThe Master said:\n\"I wish to speak of the wonders of immortality and discourse on the transformations of the Dao. You must keep this secret—guard my words well.\" (This refers to the two matters that follow.)\n\nThe Master said:\n\"Long ago there was a man named Guo Chongzi, a man of the Yin dynasty and disciple of Perfected Peng. Once, he and his three brothers were traveling together when they were attacked by evil men, who injured his left arm. His three brothers grew furious and wished to punish them, but Chongzi said it was useless. He smiled and they each went their way. Later, this man entered officialdom, and Chongzi’s praise elevated him, repeatedly and without cease. The man then went to thank him, yet Chongzi’s praise did not stop. The man said, 'I am an evil man and cannot accept the gifts of a noble one.' He then took his own life. Later, Chongzi attained the Dao, but the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate deemed him guilty of causing a man’s death and thus unworthy of becoming a Perfected Being.\" (This shows that even an excess of goodness may bring harm—how much worse, then, is evil? Many present-day affairs resemble this, so let it serve as a warning.)\n\nFan Lingzi was devoted to the Dao of immortality from his youth, persisting thus for many years. Later, he encountered Sima Jizhu, who was about to enter the mountains of Changshan. After seven years, he entered a stone chamber. In its northeast corner lay a stone *pian she*. (This is pronounced with the *ye* rhyme of *zuo*; it is a large jar. It may also be a stone *pian hu yong*.) Whenever Jizhu went out, he would tell him, \"Beware—do not open this.\" This warning was repeated many times.\n\nFan Lingzi suddenly opened it and looked inside. Below, he saw his parents and family, near yet not distant, and was overcome with sorrow and longing. When Sima Jizhu returned, he sent him home. Later, Jizhu summoned him again and had him guard a bronze chest, once more warning him not to open it. Lingzi opened it again, and as before, saw his family. Jizhu sent him away, and thus he failed to attain the Dao.\n\n(These events enter the realm of the inconceivable. Yet one must always follow this principle and take heed in similar cases.)\n\nWhen accumulated merit reaches a thousand, even with transgressions, one may still attain immortality. When merit reaches three hundred but transgressions outweigh it, one’s descendants may attain immortality. When merit reaches two hundred, one’s grandchildren may attain it. If one has neither transgressions nor merits but relies on the merits of ancestors, one may still attain immortality—this is what is meant by \"the lingering blessings of forebears.\" Those lacking resolve and burdened with many transgressions may attain wealth and nobility, but immortality remains beyond hope.\n\n(This section sets the standard for merit and transgression—how can one not strive?)\n\nHere ends the transmission of this scroll.\n\nThis scroll bears the calligraphy of a Chief Clerk and an Assistant Clerk.\n\n*True Reports*, Scroll Five.\n*True Reports*, Scroll Six.\n*The Transmission of the Mandate*, Second Section.\n*An Account of the Art of Serving the Herb*, by the Lady of Purple Tenuity.\n\n(There are two copies of this text in the hand of an Assistant Clerk. Though titled *An Account of the Art of Serving the Herb*, it largely expounds on fundamental principles and general theories, seemingly not the author’s original intent. The Lady of Purple Tenuity is rich in talent and elegant in sentiment; her words flow with abundance and ease. She traces matters from beginning to end, ever transcending the bounds of reason. In later passages, she elucidates the subtleties of the Yellow and Red with profound clarity.)\n\nNow, the morning’s first light gathers in primordial vastness, and the profound origins of the hidden dawn remain unordered. The Eight Directions are in chaos, and the numinous gates unopened. One may only gaze serenely into the empty void, allowing nature to take its course in tranquil stillness. Then, pure tones softly resound, and harmonious winds arise in unison. The twin luminaries shine with radiance, and the clouds of dawn await no invitation. They cradle the sprouting of the uncarved, blocking the myriad sources at the loom’s outset. All life returns to the true, and every kindred spirit conceals its beginnings. How could one wish for a lifespan of ten thousand years as mere mortality? Rather, one should long to embrace the talisman of longevity and dwell in eternal harmony. Why trouble oneself with the obscure realms of the spirit or delve into the illusory externals of esoteric arts?\n\nFor those whose forms lack the means to attain the true and whose vessels cannot bear its use, it is truly fitting to tread the wondrous subtleties of the Celestial Origin, to push the myriad essences to their utmost refinement, to seek the Nine Wefts and bring forth life, to behold the distant illumination of the morning light. Gazing upward at the misty qi, one sees the numinous clouds coiling through the void. Looking down upon the Six Pitches, one perceives the Eight Winds fanning their might. The Great Void emits the howl of the hidden depths, and the circular luminaries cast their radiance upon the empty sky. Then, purple mists gather in beauty, waves surge against crumbling peaks, floating vapors shape the landscape, and the clear light flees in flight. The Five Phases engage in mutual destruction, the Four Seasons clash and cast aside. Metal and Earth draw close, while Water and Fire form enmity. Forests and grasses halt their growth, and the hundred rivers open and close. Thunderous lightning rages and boils, thunder shakes east and west, splitting and shattering. Heaven is in turmoil—this is the calamity of the Yang Ninth. Earth is obstructed—this is the convergence of the Hundred Sixth. The excess of the Celestial Stem reaches its limit, and one sees the blood of the flock of dragons spilled across the fields of Earth. Thus, fortune and misfortune collide, and the multitude is shown omens of disaster.\n\nThose who tread the level Way shall see the reclusive attain true felicity, while those who dwell in secluded abundance shall find no path unblessed. Yet to brave peril is to journey with corpses borne in procession; to venture northeast is to lose companions and meet with regret. Should the great rivers prove unkind, the clarity of the Kan well’s depths shall sink into ruin. All this arises when humanity loses its true nature, when things turn against our harmony. Myriad shifts unfold, and spirits and ghosts ply their schemes, even causing Heaven and Earth to lose constancy, making the common folk their concern.\n\nThus did the Supreme Perfected One take pity on the restless multitudes, opening the dark ford to awaken the worthy. Thereupon, guiding through a hundred transformations and grasping the principles of life in full, those who dwell in fortune and virtue remain ever whole, while those who abide in peril and harm wither and break. Those who master the Six Qi attain fixed longevity; those who ingest the numinous fungus achieve divine ease. Wondrous formulas and supreme arts unfold within the mysteries of the Clear Void. Golden tablets and jade slips are compiled upon the Terrace of Commissions and Plumes. Subtle and profound, the divine chant resonates, the true radiance merging and parting. To sing its verses is to rein in the dawn at the Grand Tenuity; to employ its Way is to wheel through the Nine Peaks. Carriages and canopies arrayed in the ranks of floating rosy clouds, gazing back at the Terrace of Literary Splendor. Some turn the furnace to refine cinnabar’s hidden essence, grinding and forging the purple nectar of gold and azure. The lush jade efflorescence surges in splendor, the Eight Precious Stones shimmering as they soar. Crimson fluids swirl in eddies, the dragon embryo hums in concealment. Tiger foam and phoenix brain, cloud-laden jade frost, the lunar elixir of the Great Ultimate, the Three Rings of Numinous Steel—with but a knife-tip’s measure, the divine wings unfurl. Then, donning the celestial scriptures of the Empty Sky’s upper texts, entering the chambers of Primordial Beginning, the jade tones of the resonant texts issue from the Palace of the Three Mysteries. Precious silks bear the gifts of the Three Origins, flowered pendants emit from the cinnabar groves’ chambers. The August Thearch bestows the purple leaps of exalted joy, the Supreme Perfected grants the fiery bells of flowing gold. Divine youths open the carriage shafts as the Nine Phoenixes cry in unison. Heavenly pipes startle the void, morning bells chime in scattered resonance. Raising the body and lowering the banner, the Eight Effulgences float in the sky. Dragon carriages and tiger banners fan out across the eight directions, ascending to the utmost tips of Eternal Yang, descending to repose in the orchid halls of inverted shadows. Moon consorts harness their teams of four, sunlight illumines the visage; spirit maidens embrace the quilts as incense smoke overflows the windows. A glance and a turn—how the circular net strides beyond! What need to speak of the ninety thousand li? Only then does one know the Way of the lofty immortals stands supreme, the subtleties of seeking the numinous are profound, the attainment of ingestion and adornment unites with the divine, and the workings of fortune and misfortune suddenly become manifest.\n\nHad it not been for the noble scion’s *Yellow and Lao Jade Writ*, the *Thirty-Nine Perfected Scriptures of the Great Cavern*, or the *Supreme Hidden Mystery of the Seven Origins of Vast Emptiness*, none would have found peers in this art. Yet there are those who, by embodying the spirit in concentrated thought, treasuring and refining the Hall of Light, and journeying at dawn to the Six Numinous Ones, cause the Five Viscera to blossom with radiance. They guard and seal the Primal Pass, inwardly preserve the Nine Perfected, and circulate the Three Qi to irrigate the Cinnabar Field—this, too, is a secondary path.\n\nFor one whose cinnabar sincerity is as plain as coarse herbs, what need is there for the grand sacrifices of the eastern neighbor? Instead, one may augment with five-cloud cassia, water-plantain roots, yellow essence, southern candle and yang grass, eastern stone and azure-green, pine and cypress resin and fruit, sesame and poria—all implements of nurturing life, by which longevity may be attained.\n\nI have further observed the strengths and weaknesses of plants and trees, noting those that swiftly benefit the self, yet none rival the manifold proofs of *Atractylodes*’ efficacy. Of late, killing qi has shrouded the heavens, baleful fumes have stilled the light, malevolent demons have surged forth, and a hundred ailments have converged. Whether from wind-cold binding the Passes or flowing swellings and chronic afflictions, misfortunes have assailed without warning, and illnesses have arisen beyond expectation—day by day, they gather in throngs.\n\nNow, *Atractylodes* qi checks demonic fluids, exhaled smoke subdues and breaks the joints of evil. It fortifies the interior and gathers the hun-soul, enriches the blood and engenders the brain, expels malignity and induces the true, guards essence and defends life.\n\nConsuming it as food renders the spirit supple and pervasive, bestowing radiance and lightness. Taking it in pills or powders dispels the hundred diseases, and the five viscera brim with fluid—thus vision endures long and grows ever clearer. The ancients called it the \"crimson essence of mountain spirits\" and the \"quintessence of *Alpinia*.\" The *Tai Shang Daoist Inscription on Immortality* states: *\"If you desire long life, consume the mountain essence. If you desire to soar lightly, consume the mountain ginger.\"* Such is its meaning.\n\nI do not claim that all other substances should be reduced in favor of *Atractylodes* for benefit. Yet the efficacy of *Atractylodes* qi is precisely what this age requires. In this latter age, illness abounds—it is fitting to take and employ it. Though the Dao may be inwardly sufficient, one still fears the calamities of external affairs. Even when the form is outwardly replete, there may yet be the flaw of inner collapse. The extremes of Zhang and Shan serve as warning enough.\n\n*Atractylodes* can grant long life and enduring longevity, and secondly, it can repel the myriad afflictions of malevolent demons. I have seen recluses in the mountains and forests who, having mastered this Way, live for eight hundred or a thousand years, standing shoulder to shoulder with the Five Peaks. Yet people, burdened by excessive writing, cannot even record one or two methods to demonstrate it.\n\nNow I compile several formulas for taking *Atractylodes* to enlighten those who cherish secrecy. If one truly believes and employs them, they may avert sudden and violent disasters. When great peace arrives, the four directions will harmonize, the celestial weave will nurture life, calamitous fumes will vanish, the five poisons will conceal their forms, the two luminaries will ever watch over, and the myriad things will flourish of themselves. At such a time, you may act as you will—no more will there be untimely ruin.\n\nWhat I have spoken of *Atractylodes* is meant to urge those with intent to take and use it, thereby averting these disasters and ailments.\n\nOf late, however, lesser scholars have vied with one another in confusion, often employing indiscriminate concoctions and the methods of the *Yellow Writ* and *Red Realm*. These indeed contain the true essentials of harmonizing the two complementary forces of life. If one unites in the Dao, breaks free from the snares of the world, aligns with the six directions, follows the seasonal nodes, averts disasters, dispels misfortunes, congeals essence, and treasures the embryo—above, the spirits of the brain will not wane; below, the three fields will overflow. Advancing and retreating in proper measure, calamities will be dispelled; warp and weft will align, and health will endure. Enemies will grasp the reins without faltering, and the six armies will march far and return whole—such are its benefits. Yet this is not the grandest affair of the immortals’ tradition.\n\nAlas, how perilous! Though these are arts of mutual generation and methods of transcendence, they resemble driving an ice chariot through the fiery regions or sailing a fire boat upon drowning waters. Without true rectitude, failure is all but certain.\n\nSome may defy celestial patterns, harbor slanderous malice and envy, causing the spiritual root to stagnate and block, the cycles of fortune and misfortune to diverge. They violate sacred vows and offend the luminous, incurring the wrath of the Three Officials. Or they provoke enmity and chain disasters, leading royal armies to defeat. Or they bury captives alive and slaughter the surrendered, soaking the fields with blood. Or they exhaust their horses’ strength yet still press onward—if they then plunge deep into the northern frontier without resistance, will they not surely perish beneath the Xiongnu blades? Their bodies will die abroad, their families be executed at home. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?\n\nI have witnessed many such cases—few gain benefit, only vain strivings for survival, sighing endlessly over the cycle of rebirth. How much better to guard the cinnabar truth within the Crimson Palace, summon the primordial spirit to the Mud Pill, preserve the vital fluids without loss, seal the hidden arts at the Gate of Destiny, ingest sacred herbs to nurture life, rinse the mouth with flower-streams in clear rivers, study the profound and wondrous secret formulas, and recite the hidden chapters of the Most High. Then one may dwell high among the peaks and ridges, reckoning time alongside gold and stone. What lord could claim such a one as friend? What emperor could make them a subject? Far from the Five Turbidities of the dusty world, ever in purity awaiting the true. Leisurely and carefree, I delight in my clouds.\n\n*(Note: The subsequent prescriptions are absent in both versions, though two separate formula texts appear to correspond to this method. They have been compiled in the third scroll.)*\n\nThis passage appears in two appended manuscripts—one on yellow paper, one on azure—where the Azure Lad of the Directions remarks:\n\n\"To pursue the Dao is bitter; not to pursue it is also bitter. From birth to old age, from old age to sickness, guarding the body until death—its sufferings are boundless. The vexations of the heart and the accumulation of sins perpetuate the cycle of birth and death, its bitterness beyond words. How much more so for those who fail to live out their natural span?\n\nTo pursue the Dao is bitter: maintaining purity to preserve the true, guarding the mysterious to contemplate the numinous, seeking teachers through hardship, enduring hundreds of trials, diligently keeping the mind from lapsing, resolutely focusing the will—this is the utmost bitterness. To regard the rank of lords as transient, gold and jade as mere bricks and stones, and fine silks as rags—only then can one be said to truly inquire into the Dao.\"\n\nThe Azure Lad of the Directions further states: \"One who cultivates the Dao and severs the roots of love and desire is like a hand grasping a string of pearls—one by one, they will eventually be exhausted. Gradually removing external evils will also reach an end. When all is exhausted, the Dao is attained.\"\n\nAgain, a parable likens it to an ox bearing a heavy load through the mire: utterly spent, it dares not glance left or right, hastening only to escape the mud and find respite. For the Daoist, the passions and desires are far worse than that mire. With a steadfast heart set upon the Dao, one may avoid the manifold sufferings and likewise attain the Dao.\n\n*(A cautious note records that the Supreme Minister’s audience contained no oral transmissions—only these two admonitions and a single song-poem, which may not have been personally witnessed or recorded by Master Yang.)*\n\nThe Perfected King of Western Citadel declared: “For a being to depart the Three Evil Paths and attain human birth is difficult. Having attained human birth, to leave the female form and become male is difficult. Having become male, to possess all six senses and four limbs intact is difficult. With the six senses complete, to be born in the Central Kingdom is difficult. Having been born in the Central Kingdom, to encounter a lord of the Dao is difficult. Having encountered a lord of the Dao, to be born into a family that studies the Dao is difficult. To possess a heart of kindness and benevolence is difficult. With a benevolent heart awakened, to believe in the Dao, virtue, and long life is difficult. Having believed in the Dao, virtue, and long life, to encounter the era of Great Peace under the *ren-chen* cycle is difficult. How can one not be exhorted to diligence?”\n\n*(The Three Evil Paths refer to rebirths where one fails to become human—namely, as birds, beasts, or insects and livestock.)*\n\nThe Most High questioned a Daoist, saying: “How many days does a human life span?” One replied, “A matter of several days.” The Most High said, “You have not yet attained the Dao.” Another replied, “A human life spans the time between meals.” The Most High said, “You may depart; you have not yet spoken of the Dao.” Another replied...\n\n“Within the span of a single breath.” The Most High said, “Excellent! This may be called speaking of the Dao. I once heard these words, and now I tell them to you. If you diligently study the Dao, you may yet transcend this breath. Though my disciples may be thousands or tens of thousands of miles away from my [teachings]—their hearts holding fast to my precepts—they shall surely attain the Dao. Those who study the jade-classic treasured scriptures shall surely achieve immortality. As for those who stand at my left side, their intentions incline toward perverse conduct; they shall never attain the Dao.\n\nWhen one pursues the Dao—reading the Daoist scriptures and performing Daoist deeds—it is like tasting honey: the entire mouth is sweet, the six viscera are delighted, and a lingering savor remains. Those who can act thus shall attain the Dao. *(The Supreme Minister has no descending Yang matters; this refers only to absorbing the radiance of the sun and moon.)*\n\nThe Perfected of Great Emptiness, the Red Lord of South Mountain, declared: “When a person commits many evils yet does not repent, suddenly restraining their heart, their sins return to them as rivers flow to the sea, daily growing deeper and wider. But if one recognizes their wrongs, repents, and turns to goodness, their sins vanish and virtue accumulates—thus may they attain the Dao.\n\nWhen others bring misfortune upon you, meet it with blessing. Thus, the qi of fortune and virtue ever arises from this. The qi of harm and heavy calamity returns instead to them. This is the conduct of one who studies the Dao.”\n\nHe further declared: “When the wicked harm the worthy, it is like spitting toward the sky—the spittle does not [reach] the sky but returns to [strike] oneself. *(All instances of ‘刑’ should be ‘形’.)* To cast dust against the wind is to have it not [reach] the other but instead drench one’s own body. The Dao cannot be destroyed; calamity must perish the self.”\n\nThe Perfected of Great Emptiness said: “To feed a hundred ordinary people is not equal to feeding one good person. To feed a thousand good people is not equal to feeding one who studies the Dao. Those who endure cold and dwell in the mountains and forests—take this especially to heart.”\n\nThe Red Lord also had no further separate instructions to impart.\n\nThe Lady of Purple Prime declared: “There are five difficulties in the world. The first is that poverty makes bestowing alms difficult. The second is that great wealth makes studying the Dao difficult. The third is that controlling one’s fate to avoid death is difficult. The fourth is that obtaining and beholding the Cavernous Scriptures is difficult. The fifth is that being born in the sagely age after the *ren-chen* cycle is difficult.\n\nLong ago, I asked the Most High: ‘By what means may one come to know one’s past lives?’ The Most High replied: ‘The Dao and virtue are formless; knowing them brings no benefit. What is essential is to guard one’s resolve and practice the Dao. It is like polishing a mirror—once the grime is removed, clarity remains, and one’s own form becomes visible. Sever the six passions, guard emptiness and purity, and you will both perceive the truth of the Dao and know your past lives.’\n\nHe further said: ‘Contemplate the Dao, practice the Dao, and have faith in the Dao, and you will attain the root of faith. Its blessings are measureless.’\n\nThe Lady of Purple Tenuity declared: “One who practices the Dao is like one who carries fire into a dark room—the darkness vanishes, and only light remains. When one who studies the Dao preserves correctness, ignorance is extinguished, and correctness alone endures. Wealth and sensual pleasure in relation to oneself are like a small child coveting the honey on a blade’s edge—its sweetness is insufficient to delight the mouth, yet it brings the peril of a severed tongue.”\n\nThe Lady of Mystic Clarity declared: “The entanglements of a man with wife, children, and treasured home are more grievous than imprisonment in shackles. Imprisonment in shackles may yet be pardoned, but the passions of wife and children—even when they bring calamity as dire as a tiger’s maw—one still willingly casts oneself into them. Such transgressions admit no pardon. Emotional attachments ensnare a person as surely as one who grasps a torch and walks against the wind. The fool who does not release the torch will surely burn his hand. The poisons of greed, anger, and ignorance dwell within the human body. If one does not swiftly remove this disaster through the Dao, peril is certain. This is what it means for the ignorant to burn their hands.\n\nOne who practices the Dao is like wood upon the water, following the current as it flows. It neither strikes the left bank nor the right bank. It is not seized by men, nor is it obstructed by ghosts and spirits. Nor does it rot and decay. I guarantee it will reach the sea. When a person practices the Dao, is not deluded by filthy desires, is not deceived by manifold evils, and advances with unflagging resolve and no doubt, I guarantee they will attain the Dao.”\n\nThe Lady of the Southern Culmen said: “From love arises sorrow; when sorrow arises, fear follows. Without love, there is no sorrow; without sorrow, there is no fear. Once there was a man who recited scriptures late into the night with such grief that his emotions were deeply stirred, and suddenly he was overcome with longing for home. The Perfected of the Most High then appeared in the guise of an ordinary man and went directly to ask him: ‘Have you ever played the zither?’ The man replied: ‘When I was at home, I used to play it.’ The Perfected said: ‘What is it like when the strings are slack?’ The man replied: ‘They do not sound, nor do they evoke sorrow.’ The Perfected asked again: ‘What is it like when the strings are too taut?’ The man replied: ‘The sound breaks, and it becomes mournful.’ The Perfected asked once more: ‘What is it like when slackness and tension are balanced?’ The man replied: ‘All notes harmonize, and the eight tones resound in wondrous concert.’ The Perfected said: ‘Studying the Dao is the same. When the mind is properly attuned, it is like playing the zither—the Dao may be attained.’\n\nOf all great desires, none is greater than sensual pleasure. Its transgressions know no bounds, and its consequences admit no pardon. Were it to have even one more counterpart, not a single person under heaven could practice the Dao.\n\nThose who study the Dao—no act of hidden virtue is greater than bestowing kindness and delivering salvation, and no resolve is greater than guarding the body and serving the Dao. Their blessings are vast, and their lives are firmly established. If someone bears ill will toward me, I do not accept it; the ill will returns to its source. Disaster will return to their body as surely as a shadow follows form and an echo follows sound.”\n\nThe above are the teachings and admonitions of the assembled numinous beings. Recorded here are the words of three male Perfected and two female Perfected.\n\nThe exalted Perfected Ones, in their noble majesty, descend and gather but rarely. I fear these are but accounts of those who have descended, recounted as if by the Four Lords of the Jasper Terrace chanting on the autumn equinox—not necessarily received directly from Lord Yang himself. Thrice have I witnessed changes; twice have I been told to wait. The essential matter now is to rise and build a dwelling on East Mountain, and for the time being, one may depart from protective custody.\n\nWhen I inquired as to the reason, no answer was given. I asked the assembled numinous beings, “Is it perhaps thus with me?” Yet the meaning remains unclear. I wish to understand it.\n\n*(This passage is Lord Yang’s own record, discussing the affairs of the Prefectural Governor.)*\n\nThose who often wander in thought through mountains and marshes, entrusting their spirit to the immortals and Perfected Ones—if their qi is moved by compassion for your distant joy, and the mountain spirits rejoice in your turning toward the Dao, then the hundred illnesses cannot invade, and the hundred evils cannot assail. Those who frequently burn incense at your side will find their hun and po rectified, and ever perceive the fragrance of the wind’s qi. Over time, they will come to realize this. Realization leads to entering the Dao; entering the Dao leads to attaining immortality; attaining immortality leads to becoming a Perfected One.\n\n*(From the preceding scroll, ten poems of waiting and verse follow the precepts, continuing to this point—altogether eight sheets. All were later inscribed by hand on ruled paper, with half a line of characters written at the end.)*\n\nThis is Yang’s writing. Upon gazing serenely at the movements of heaven and earth, one should recognize that there must have been further continuations by Yang before this. Later hands merely transcribed and appended other continuations—hence the prior omission of thirty-four characters. (What Yang originally wrote here is now unknown.)\n\nSerenely gazing at heaven and earth, one aspires to become a flying immortal.\nSerenely gazing at mountains and rivers, one aspires to become a flying immortal.\nSerenely gazing at the ten thousand things, one cherishes the compassion of their nurturing and sustaining.\nConstantly maintaining such a heart, one attains the Dao.\n\nHuman life is but an illusion,\na brief sojourn between heaven and earth.\nYet if one refines qi and nurtures spirit,\nstriving with bitter diligence to infuse the true,\none will attain the Dao for long.\nWhen the Dao is perfected, one dwells together with heaven and earth in the Great Vastness.\nIf one penetrates emptiness and embodies non-being,\nthen one abides with the Great Vastness in utter stillness.\nOne who can fathom stillness\nwill find it invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing.\nThe root of life and death is easily untied,\nand the pursuit of enduring years is easily found.\nWhat is found may be grasped;\nwhat is untied may endure.\n\nTo endure in the Dao is to nurture life.\nTo wander long and freely is to absorb qi.\nWhen qi is whole, life persists.\nOnly then can one nurture to perfection.\nPerfected nurture unites with the true,\nand only then can one endure.\nAscending to the two realms of vital qi,\ngazing toward the utter stillness of complete nurture—\none sees the ten thousand things, in their dark and yellow hues, as mere temporary lodgings.\nHow could one not be diligent?\n\nWhen qi is whole, it repels demonic spirits.\nWhen nurture is complete, it repels the hundred harms.\nEntering the army, one does not encounter weapons;\ntraversing the mountains, one does not meet tigers or wolves.\nThis is what is meant.\nThe heart of one who studies the Dao.\n\nEver maintain the urgency of remembering one’s morning meal—none who do so fail to attain their aim. Cherish qi as one cherishes one’s own face and eyes—none who do so fail to preserve it whole. Yet faces and eyes may still be marred, just as qi may still be lost. What men cherish most is ever their face and eyes, fearing defilement, and only secondarily their four limbs. Were one to cherish qi as the first and most pressing concern of the whole body, I would seldom see men wither away.\n\n*(Note: The qi spoken of here refers to the seminal essence of the bedchamber, not the qi of breath.)*\n\nMen, following custom, seek after florid reputations—like burning incense: all around may smell its fragrance, yet they do not realize it scorches itself to ash. When the incense is spent, its qi vanishes; when the name is established, the self perishes. Thus the lofty withdraw and smile, keeping to purity and stillness.\n\nLife, as a thing, is like the sun, moon, heaven, and earth—these four images stand directly opposed to the arising of life. Lose life, and the four images also perish. It is not that the four images perish, but that the perishing of life destroys them. Were life to endure always, the four images would endure always—not because the four images endure, but because I can make life endure. Enduring life can even generate that which casts no shadow—what need to reckon with the four images?\n\nDisaster strikes, calamity arises, form decays, qi scatters—what manner of affair is this? It seems to arise from much speech without holding to the One, from many schemes seeking mere escape. Thus the lofty nest collapses and its branches fall; a hundred victories are lost in a single defeat. Alas for the talent of one who might have become a transcendent—how could it be ruined by the folly of a mere stripling?\n\n*(The phrase “ruined by the folly of a stripling” alludes to the malady in the gaohuang region that could not be cured, borrowing from the dream of Duke Jing of Jin. Otherwise, it may refer to some other childish misdeed.)*\n\nAs the Lady of South Mountain Peak said:\nThe swan and heron face the southern journey,\ntheir distant wings stirring the air.\nAmid the wilds of ten thousand and a hundred,\nthose birds deem themselves sufficient.\nYet the turtledove sighs at their meager reach,\nand the great Peng laughs at the span of their flight—\na mere hand’s breadth.\n\nContent with what is content, right and wrong settle of themselves.\n\nThus the three birds do not confer among themselves—why mock them?\n\nThe Purple Tenuity states:\n\nThe eight clauses above are all from Yang’s writings. The perfected of antiquity held solely to the tally of numinous unity, yielding to the transformations of dark contemplation and compliant compliance. They illuminated the level path to harmonize with change, and grasped the hidden pivot to align all things. Therefore, beyond the bounds of spontaneity, they preserved it without discourse; within the realm of governance, they discoursed without debate.\n\nIn former times, the mystic wind faded and vanished, the dusty qi thickened and spread. The great Way sank into oblivion, and the shallow and false flourished. Those who galloped and raced cast aside the true beyond the edge of the cliff; the restless and anxious thronged the marketplace of form and reputation, gluttonous for gain. Those who wielded cunning gave rise to the calamity of drifting and dissipation; those who coveted and sought brought upon themselves the burden of self-aggrandizement. They strayed from the constant in pursuit of what they fancied, and departed from the ultimate rightness for what was not right.\n\nWhich is dearer, name or self? The Daoist’s solemn *admonition* (should read *admonition*).\n\nTo tread the depths is the utmost warning of guarding the One. How lamentable indeed!\n\nOn the night of the eighth day of the sixth month, *Preserving Life* addressed Steward Xu: To know that the boundless harms one’s nature, and that the heart, swayed by likes and dislikes, disturbs the true—how could this compare to guarding the root, purifying the empty and tranquil, and dwelling in the cultivation of the Three Spirits? Thus one pervades the myriad things and merges with the mirror-like stillness of the profound, utterly dissolved and unified with the Mud Pill, so that inner and outer share in equal blessing.\n\nThis may be shown to Hu Ya.\n\nThe Lady of South Mountain Peak says:\nHasten the distribution of the elixir.\n\nDo not allow disturbances along the River’s course. (The *dispersal* appears to be the *Atractylodes Powder*. The River refers to the Water Official.)\n\n*Preserving Life* says: Those who neglect the cultivation of the Dao and virtue, or who study the Way without attainment, will fail to keep pace with the diligent disciples who initiate merit. Of late, I have seen none who advance day by day. The resolve to learn has naturally waned. (The virtue of seven generations is fundamentally rooted in the scholar. Without study, it can no longer be relied upon—thus this serves as a warning.) Those who grasp at the higher Dao yet remain indolent are but *lower ghosts*. (The *lower ghosts* refer to the spirits who preside over lesser understandings, not necessarily the ghosts of the palace. The scriptures also speak of this.)\n\nWhen in office, remain free of affairs. *Yi the Perfected* inwardly refines; entanglements do not sully his clarity, nor do rivalries disturb his heart-mind. Such is the Daoist in office. Those who dwell in *Xiu the Mysterious* and abide in lofty solitude, though mountains and rivers collapse, do not glance aside. Those who preserve the Dao and guard the true, though cold and heat, hunger and thirst assail them, remain unguarded. This is the utmost of single-minded devotion.\n\nWhen essence scatters to the eight hollows and the hun-wandering drifts through the ten thousand *waters*, some seize the moment when the wind blows to invade the gaps, while others cling to demons to bind themselves in illness.\n\nLet all things be cast aside and unheard. The Dao of old is not the Dao of today. If spiritual awareness differs, what can the hundred gaps do to me? What I have heard is sufficient to restore simplicity.\n\n*(The above nine clauses are all from Yang’s writings.)*\n\nThe true one is entirely free from the stirrings of emotion and desire, from thoughts of male and female. If crimson and white linger in the heart-mind, true resonance will not respond, and the numinous maiden, the supreme honored one, will not descend. Even if there are those who attain something, it extends no further than the master of the moment. The coupling of yin qi can never lead to the cultivation of the supreme Dao. I once deeply regretted how swiftly this reliance changes.\n\nThus the true Dao cannot be sought through opposition, nor essential words heard by chance. Where there is a pair, there is no truth. Where external things are combined, truth and falsehood intermingle. The traces of truth and falsehood are clearly discernible.\n\n*(This clause should be Master Pei’s words.)*\n\n*(From another text:)* Weeping is but the sound of hastening toward death; grief is the great affliction of rotting bones. I fear you have not yet awakened to this, and thus I worry for you. Those who grieve excessively will be touched by licentious qi. Though Master Lai may be skilled in your arts, what can he do against the one who stretches upon the wooden tablet? This is what Lord Dinglu cautions against.\n\n*(The above clause is from Yang’s writings, though the latter part was cut off and incomplete.)*\n\nMu, in trepidation, speaks: Meeting with the mysterious fate, I have been granted the hearing of the ancestral teaching. In every matter, I will follow and yield, awakening my heart-mind. My benevolence lingers and clings, my reverence is boundless. As for the distinction between beginning and end...\n\nThe natural principle of Heaven is to delight in life and abhor death. Human sentiment is ever thus moved—weeping and mourning are but the sorrow of parting, the rites of hastening to the bier. Internally, they express emotion; externally, they accord with ritual. This is what the worthy and the common alike uphold, and none may transgress it. Though I, Mu, inwardly cultivate the Dao, outwardly I remain bound to the customs of the world. I have not yet cast off my robes to dwell in the mountains, nor girded myself with rope to wander alone. Thus I cannot but follow the rites that harmonize emotion and propriety, aligning inner and outer in perfect accord. Should I one day violate this, not only would I fail to bear the weight of affection, but I would also fear the harm that would befall me.\n\nYour words, my lady, are tender and attuned to feeling, yet vast in their guidance of the Dao and enduring in their instruction—truly far-reaching. I shall humbly heed your admonitions, ensuring that sorrow does not turn to harm, that weeping does not exceed restraint. I will dwell in the Dao as I please, without daring to transgress. Respectfully submitted.\n\n*(This is a reply to the letter from Youying. The matter of transmission is now lost, though it does not refer to the earlier warning about \"the sound of hastening toward death,\" yet it remains tangentially connected.)*\n\n---\n\n**From the Writings of the Attendant (Yuan):**\n*True Sayings, Scroll Six. True Sayings, Scroll Seven. \"The Transmission of Destined Appointment,\" Part Three.*\n\nEmbodying the lofty workings of destiny, savoring the mysterious and masticating the real, I summon and draw near the radiant luminaries, congealing and stilling the six spirits. My luminous guidance shines forth in the eight directions of clarity. I yield to the numinous root, treasuring and refining the three measures. Nurturing the fluids and harmonizing the hun-soul, even should a rushing wind howl and rage, it could not assail my true nature. Though a tempestuous gale may surge and darken, how could it disturb my pure and unadulterated essence?\n\nThus I empty myself and chant in stillness, with a void heart awaiting the gods. I tend and gather the hundred absences, dwelling in the utmost truth. Let no cares or burdens intrude upon the mysterious abode; let no sorrowful thoughts disturb the crimson ford. In serene detachment and distant contemplation, I rejoice in the shared radiance of light. Then the supreme joy naturally resounds in both ears, like jade chimes ringing in the empty pavilion. My mouth is filled with fragrant winds, my eyes behold the threefold clouds, and in my reverence for the four seasons, I move and pause.\n\nDaily attainment of the perfected truth—\nwherever the gaze alights, all has already merged with the divine.\nFor the true person’s attainment of truth\nis ever gained through this alone.\nTo feign truth without possessing it\nis also through this that one stumbles and falls.\n\nShould errors and ailments accumulate,\ngrief and sorrow fill the embrace,\nworldly affairs ever burden the mind,\nclinging to external paths,\nseeking harmony for the multitude’s ears,\nor chasing the heart’s worldly aging—\nsuddenly, a mournful wail arises,\nlike a child’s ceaseless weeping.\nLong lamenting the dead and grieving the departed,\none’s essence scatters, spirit disperses,\nthe three *hun*-souls perish,\nand in the void of perverse fate,\nthe *po*-soul summons *wangliang* spirits.\nThey seize my empty formation,\nbringing forth a hundred afflictions.\nHow could one grasp the Way of life\nonly to rush toward the chamber of death,\nor cast the numinous wind\nto tread upon the corpse’s abode?\nTo hurl one’s auspicious signs\ninto foul and defiled realms?\n\nI have heard of the lofty and victorious yet still proceed in ease,\noften witnessed the luminous precepts yet remain unresolved in doubt.\nThus I array petitions upon the altar,\ncausing the stench of corruption to taint the hidden scriptures.\nThe four poles strike their drums,\nthe Three Officials brandish their golden spears.\nHow could one forget the sworn covenant?\nThe Great Beginning wanders there in vain.\nThe divine tiger bares its claws,\nthe venomous dragon displays its fangs—\nthe eight directions stand desolate in sincerity.\n\nAlas, where could one flee?\nOnly after the body’s departure\ndoes one realize the worth of pure companions,\nand that the speaker’s words were not empty.\n\nYet mournful cries disrupt truth,\noffending the upright.\nWhy does the enlightened lord not dwell always in the land of fortune,\nbut here shake his robes and return to his chamber?\n\nOn the night of the eleventh day of the first month, An Fei declared.\n*(This passage concerns the ninth day of the first month in the year of yin, when Jiuhua addressed Yang Jun with mockery, prompting the Southern Perfected’s later discourse. Yang’s writing.)*\n\nThe perfected return their hearts to the One Correct,\nand the Dao’s standard rests in eternal trust.\nWhen the heart returns, the correct spirits harmonize;\nwhen trust is aligned, auspicious omens arise.\nThis is the natural response,\nrequiring no reliance on dual extremes.\n\nDelusion gives rise to right and wrong,\nsuspicion breeds doubt and semblance.\nLurking within, it harbors the mind of estrangement.\nOutwardly, it grasps at scrutiny;\ninwardly, it knots the threads of derision.\nAbandoning the primal awakening at the founding,\ndeviating from the mysterious ladder to indulge in secret suspicion—\nsuch are these followers.\nI foresee their downfall,\nnever their establishment.\n\nThose who cherish fear—\nare they alone in this?\nOn the night of the thirtieth day of the second month, the Lady of Southern Marchmount addressed Attendant Xu.\n*(This was conferred upon the Attendant, now spoken to admonish Yang Jun. Let none doubt the matter of Jiuhua. Yang’s writing.)*\n\nThus, gazing upon the vast waves that reach the heavens,\none knows they do not rise from the pools of *shuikua*.\nBeholding the boundless black wings of *xuanhan*,\none knows they do not emerge from the ranks of mere scribes.\n*(Purple Tenuity’s words:)*\nWhen myriad blossoms gather, the dragon’s pattern forms;\nwhen all voices unite, the *Yunshao* harmonizes.\nOnly when bitterness and sourness are complete\ndoes the fine flavor blend.\n\n*(The Lady of Zhonghou replied. These two phrases are drawn from the \"Extensive Analogies\" in the *Baopuzi* Outer Chapters. Later examples follow this precedent, as the assembled perfected borrow and employ them as metaphors—akin to the use of phrases from the *Zhouyi* or *Maoshi*.)*\n\nHow does that man compare to Liang Boluan?\n*(The Lady of Zhonghou’s words. \"That man\" likely refers to the Attendant.)*\n\nLiang’s virtue was narrow;\nthis one’s desolation and distant qi are far greater.\nThe tree that shades ten thousand *mu*\nmust rise from the loftiest peak.\nThe waves that surge to the heavens and shake the hills\nmust issue from the source of *Bantong*.\nHow vast is the worthy who accumulates hidden virtue—\nhe resembles the lord of *Fenyi*.\n*(Purple Tenuity’s reply. *Fenyi* refers to the state of *Shanshanshi*, a comparison to King Tai of Zhou. From \"shades ten thousand *mu*\" to \"source of *Bantong*\" are also from the \"Extensive Analogies,\" with *xiangling* altered to *zhencen*.)*\n\nThe farther north he goes, the more his wisdom closes.\n*(Right Florescence’s words:)*\nThe wise value discerning the Dao’s resonance across a thousand generations,\ngrasping the traces of rise and fall.\nThe untamed scales roam the garments of the great wilderness,\nfree from the woes of snares and tethers.\nThe numinous wings beat upon the peaks of *Xuanpu*,\nescaping the perils of nets and *sigen*.\nHow keenly they perceive fortune and misfortune!\n*(The Immortal of Life Preservation’s reply. This again combines two passages from the \"Extensive Analogies,\" altering *jijing* to *jiluo*, *linghu* to *lingyu*, and *zhaoluo* to *luosigen*.)*\n\nTo pursue the flight of the shadowless foot\nyet fail to gallop freely at *Lüliang*;\nto be one who swims the *shuiling* waves of the abyss\nyet be unable to ascend perilous heights—\ntruly, this one’s talent is extraordinary.\n\nHow could one inwardly gather and restrain?\nThose who assist the mechanism aspire to be humane—\ntheir virtue must flourish abundantly.\nWhere dense forests thicken with foliage,\nfeathered flocks gather like clouds.\nWhere dark abysses stretch vast and boundless,\nscaled multitudes race to converge.\nIf those who dwell in the heart are many,\nwhat need is there for proximity?\n\n*(Purple Tenuity’s words)*\nThe eight passages above were written by Yang. There are also copied versions. Those of the Dao should deeply study their numinous mysteries, settling the heart in matters beyond. Yet even diligent reflection on their essence—mere dregs and remnants—suffices for self-realization.\n\n*(Perfected One of Paulownia Cypress’s words)*\nFor purity, nothing compares to the Eastern Mountains;\nfor nurturing the true, nothing compares to secluded groves.\nDwelling in the luminous scene, one ascends in emptiness,\nfar from the snares of worldly dust.\nThus, how could the nets of honor and disgrace ever bind the perfected scholar?\n\n*(The two passages above were written by Yang)*\nGold and jade may pile like mountains,\nyet they are not the self.\nThe eaves of *yuequ* and *yueqie* bamboo may endure,\nyet they are not one’s own.\nThe splendor of glory and rank may be arrayed in full.\n\nYet they are not true value.\nThe fragrance and splendor of adorned beauty—\nyet they are not the real.\nIf one can dissolve and dispel them,\nthen the heart of excess and stinginess vanishes,\nand the gate of vulgar stagnation closes.\nThe awakening to what is truly noble gradually emerges,\nand the sentiments of the worldly paths become manifest.\nIf one does not do so,\nthese four all become internal harms,\nwhile externally, the afflictions of *Huandou* remain unremoved.\nIf stinginess does not disperse,\nthere is nothing left to pursue or arrange between them—\nnor any affairs worth attending to in such a state.\n\n*(Admonition to the Chief Clerk. These three characters were originally written in red, and should also be the words of the Lady of Right Radiance.)*\nFor those who pursue the Dao, there is indeed toil and hardship.\nSuch a person may be said to be one who will surely attain it.\n\n*(The above two passages were written by the clerk of the Chief Clerk.)*\nThose who study the Dao must focus single-mindedly on the Dao and direct their essence,\nwith no scattered thoughts.\nThey must cast aside extravagance,\npreserve simplicity and purity,\nand abide in stillness as if in profound secrecy, yet perceiving something,\nor in tranquility as if in hiddenness, yet gaining something.\nThey must be wholly concentrated, as if standing at the edge of a deep ravine,\nor trembling as if treading upon ice and embers.\nOnly then have they entered the gate of the Dao—\nyet they have not yet reached the inner chamber of the Dao.\n\nWhat is called difficult is the study of the Dao.\nWhat is called easy is the study of the Dao.\nTo dwell in profound stillness and deep savoring,\nto preserve harmony and celestial truth,\nto direct the spirit and lodge the numinous,\nto immerse oneself in the study of the Six Treasuries,\nto cherish essence and seal the Gate of Earth,\nto see nothing and hear nothing—\nthis is the ease of the Dao.\nYet it is precisely the inability to practice this\nthat makes it difficult.\n\n*Xu Hou*, ponder this!\n*Fuzi Ying*, refine yourself!\n\n*(The above was dictated by the Lady of Right Radiance for transcription. That lord diligently attends to these matters.)*\n\nThose who reap blessings are many—\nyet those who fall into ruin accumulate misfortune and defeat.\n\nFan Shuai said:\n*\"He who knows not the Dao—\"*\n*(This likely refers to the ghostly commander Fan Jiang.)*\n\nThe two preceding passages were appended in a clerk’s hand.\n\nLong ago, through the repeated white missives of the Hua clan, I reverently submitted my devotion. The numinous Way soared high, its resonance utterly transcendent, its echoes severed from the mortal realm. Gazing up toward the Nine Heavens, I fixed my heart lest it stray. Moved by compassion, it did not forsake me. By special grace, I received a response: the radiant words of cloud and blossom unfolded, jade tones shimmering forth. Gentle guidance, earnest and sincere, unlocked profound awakening. As I pored over the text, joy surged—my five faculties brimmed with delight.\n\nFor years, my aspiration has been steadfast, yet unfulfilled—\n*(Two characters missing. Another version reads: \"I have attained my aim.\")*\nHumbled by my seclusion in obscurity, I have only now glimpsed the light of heaven. The numinous perfected—\n*(One character missing. Another version reads: \"subtle.\" This may be incorrect.)*\n—have entreated me. Their teachings converge, compelling me to restrain myself and amend my faults, to reflect and dissolve my vulgar stagnation. Rising early, I diligently cultivate my heart; in sleep, I awaken to my own nature. Through the accumulation of sincerity, at last I have obtained a faint resonance.\n\nThe celestial cycle has now aligned, and the appointed time for audience draws near. *(The character 想 is suspected to be extraneous.)* Truly, *(two characters missing; another version reads \"to long for\")* my life has been mired in worldly delusion, sunk deep in the dust’s obscurity. Unaware of the loftiest Perfected, I once believed the Dao ended here. I resolved to temper my nature through stillness, to refine *(one character missing; four characters in red ink)* and treasure it. Yet it is not that sensual desires are *(one character missing)* many, but that the difficulty lies in their mastery. *(One character missing.)* As for the warnings of water and fire, the metaphors of ice and burning coals—these now shine forth with luminous clarity. I reverently uphold the pure precepts, striving to diminish and diminish again, *(以 is likely the missing character)* until I reach the state of dead ashes.\n\nI lament my late awakening and regret that my grasp of the pivotal moment comes so near its end. The words on the use of fire—how subtle their meaning! Reflecting on them, drawing parallels, I am filled with remorse and dread. In the past, I relied upon Master Hua, who ever urged and encouraged me, hoping I might achieve something and witness the transformative alchemy. Yet I indulged in the allure of worldly splendor, treading the Dao without steadfastness. I have always wished to share quiet leisure with you, to pour out my heart’s bitterness in full. But our inclinations differ, and intimate counsel is hard to come by. Still, the longing *(two characters missing)* in my heart is to offer my sincerest devotion. I wonder—might there yet be hope for me?\n\n*(The following two letters are replies from the Senior Scribe. The first conveyed the intent of Hua Qiao, seemingly in response to an earlier letter. The latter mentions the words on the use of fire, but the present text is incomplete.)*\n\nAbove: Two letters.\n\nIn the fifth month, Master Mao the Younger mentioned on a lost day that Hua Qiao had leaked celestial patterns and recklessly expounded on emptiness and nothingness. Now, the Hua family—father and son—are being examined by the Water Bureau. Hua Qiao’s deviation from the Dao stems from Hua Qi’s flattery and disorder, which corrupted his resolve. As for Hua Tuan and Hua Xigu, the Three Bureaus used them for testing, but the trial proved unsuccessful. Thus, Qiao was sentenced to death, his name promptly stricken from the registers and his scalp delivered to the Water Bureau. Secretly inquire whether anyone in his household bears this name—and if so, who it is. *(The preceding all responds to inquiries about the Hua family’s affairs, though it remains unclear whether this refers to the Year of the Ox or the Year of the Rat.)*\n\nXu Chao brutally murdered Zhang Huan, the Merit Officer of Xinye Commandery, and wrongfully demanded a dragon-horse. These men all await opportune moments to act, having already reported to the Water Bureau. The Bureau has pressured Xu Dou to restore his ancestral tombs and observe his household, seeking the son of the declining line to appease the accusers. The appointed day of his death falls on the lost day of the lost month—by then, his retribution shall arrive. You, having received your mandate, should be capable of subduing ten thousand ghosts and restraining a thousand spirits. I wish to witness your use of hands in this. To ensure no further harm, you ought to visit Dou’s grave on this day, rebuke and summon Huan and the others, and command the Left Bureau to seek a replacement for examination, thereby eradicating the source of contention. Do not disclose this. Instead, claim that I have lent you my authority. I wonder if you might attempt to subdue and eliminate them. The traces of ghost-destruction—such matters are *{momentarily sufficient}* to meet the need.\n\nWritten on the night of the sixteenth day of the sixth month, this letter was entrusted by the Younger Master.\n\n*(This instructs Yang to suppress the tomb litigation for the Senior Scribe’s family. Xu Chao, formerly of Nanyang Commandery, had the power to kill a man of Xinye. These three cases do not appear in Zhou Fang’s interrogations of the Master—likely the forty-third entry in the records. Though Dou ranks among the immortals, he remains pressured by the Water Bureau due to lingering baleful qi from mourning.)*\n\nThree hundred sheets of paper. *(In recompense to Ghost Marshal Wang Yan, who recently reported in writing on the gathering of the Pestle Sect, proving his merit.)*\n\nThree *dou* of oil. *(In recompense to Ghost Marshal Fu Huang, who recently assisted the Merit Officer’s emissary in manifesting his majesty to illuminate ghostly forms, preventing their violence.)*\n\nThirty feet of green silk. *(In recompense to Ghost Marshal Fan Jiang, who recently captured and executed a hundred evils, dispelling litigation and dispersing calamity, proving his merit.)*\n\nThree silver forks. *(In recompense to Ghost Marshal Liang Wei, who recently protected the ailing, summoned souls, and settled spirits, preventing tomb litigation—rendering exceptional merit.)*\n\nThe above four offerings were deceptive pledges. On the thirteenth day of the sixth month, the Lesser Mao Lord temporarily assumed the form of a jade axe and appeared in a dream to Hu Ya, commanding the couple to clearly deliver these four kinds of offerings in recompense to the four marshals who had captured ghosts. Why do you no longer recall this so that I may ask you further? *(My question means: \"Let us both be attentive.\" It was not that these four ghost marshals were originally Daoist libationers, who, having mastered the arts of release from below, received scriptures and became ghost marshals.)*\n\nSince there were recompenses in the form of deceptive pledges, they would long serve one’s own purposes with diligence. The reason for appearing in a dream in the form of a jade axe was that Hu Ya’s hun and po had yet to connect with the perfected immortals. The jade axe is pure, bright, and cleansing; after prolonged fasting and purification of the po, the heart draws near to the immortals, thus borrowing its image to communicate through dreams. Though the dream was communicated, if one still fails to awaken, it may be said that faith is not sincere. Or if one awakens yet forgets the pledges, it may be said that sincerity lacks reflection.\n\nAs for deceptive vows, all receive their mandates in secret exchange—one must be cautious not to let others know. The outer scripture says: *\"I have heard the mandate; it cannot be shown to others.\"* *(The \"Yang Zhi Shui\" chapter of the Mao Odes states: \"I have heard the mandate; it cannot be told to others.\" This refers precisely to such matters.)*\n\nThe night of the thirtieth day of the sixth month.\n\nThe Lesser Lord bestowed the scripture, revealing it in utmost secrecy. The True Controller of Merit states: *\"Those who exert strength over the hundred ghosts or command generals to harness celestial might must employ such deceptive vows.\"* The civil officials of the underworld govern the texts of the Dao for those who dissolve their bonds below; the martial generals of the underworld govern the martial texts for those who dissolve their bonds below. Civil dissolutions advance once every one hundred forty years; martial dissolutions advance once every two hundred eighty years. Martial dissolution is the lowest rank of dissolution.\n\nThose whose hearts stir with worldly desires, who indulge in impurity while feigning clarity, who adorn their eyes to follow the world yet fear death and seek immortality—these are mostly bound to martial dissolutions. *(This is the category of martial dissolutions; many in the world resemble this.)* They should take the Five Beverage Pellets to dispel the qi of water retention. Prepare them swiftly—not merely to cure illness, but also to preserve a fair complexion and radiant qi.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-third day of the sixth month, the Lady of South Mountain Peak delivered this message. *(The Chief Archivist has long suffered from thin rheum; recently, his illness flared, hence this revelation. The Five Beverage Pellets are those known in the world.)* When the Five Beverage Pellets are refined with precision, great efficacy will follow. For now, one may rest and recover.\n\n(Range Anyuan’s words:) Tell Chief Archivist Xu not to worry—there is no need for such deception. He may return it. *(The Lord of Life-Preservation to Marquis Xu: “Do not fret. The deception of the heir-physician—let it be returned.”)*\n\nThe Lady of the Right and Right Radiance spoke: The Young Lord said, “We two are officers and soldiers. It is fitting to offer deceptive apologies. Present the secret treasures from your person. If you do not, this junior will later refuse to exert himself for you.” (This refers to Xu Hou and his ilk.) What Xu {Quantu} relies upon is his younger brother; what Xu Ya relies upon is his father. Good deeds must not be forgotten; evil deeds must not be forgotten. Moreover, these are secret treasures—keys to penetrating the subtle. Silver, too, is a secondary treasure. Now, the more heartfelt the sentiment, the more refined it becomes. Do not repeat this often, lest it weary and deplete his spirit.\n\n*(The Young Lord of Lesser Mao Peak {orally transmitted}:)* The lowly Xu was the daughter of Daishi Zi. She was slain by her enemy, the Xue family, along with others. The Xue also killed Xu’s embrace of her infant, Aning. Xu now resides in the Water Bureau, accompanied by her child. Her bones drift and float, and her case is also under litigation in the Three Bureaus, seeking to confront and examine the living. When Aning was killed, his head bore a sore that spread across his face and eyes. *(Upon consulting the register, Daijian is not recorded—likely because women’s names were not publicly noted.)*\n\nOn the night of the second day of the seventh month, the Young Lord transmitted this text. That same evening, the Chief Scribe also received [a dream]. (This is the character for \"dream.\" True texts often appear thus.)\n\nThe pivot of life and death, the convergence of gain and loss—how much more pressing this becomes. Why not dwell afar in the profound savor of the Dao, delighting in emptiness and transcending the mundane? To seek near-term responses is to invite ever more [delay]. This, too, is a path leading to loss.\n\nMay you embody lofty refinement and not pursue matters down to the finest detail.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-sixth day of the seventh month, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity transmitted this composition, instructing that it be given to Chief Scribe Xu.\n\n*(From the Young Lord of Lesser Mao Peak, a total of eighteen slips in Yang script.)*\n\nAt midday on the twenty-seventh day of the seventh month, Hua Hou, Registrar Xu, was to enter meditation. At that time, nothing further remained—this was merely to guard against what had not yet come to pass.\n\nThe reason I could not recently report my grave illness was out of caution regarding the precepts. Moreover, if worldly people knew of the distress of those not yet afflicted, they would surely violate the prohibitions of the Three Bureaus. This would bring further harm to the body, compounding illness and severing recovery.\n\nWhy then do you indulge in such excessive worry? Which is dearer, name or body? This is worth reflection.\n\nEven if one were to substitute the small for the great—what would that avail a father? If both great and small were to come, what would that avail a mother? To weaken one’s own body is to bring litigation upon one’s own family. The Three Bureaus have their own settled affairs; worry [or grief] will not resolve them.\n\nOnly those who attain equanimity within and without may escape dread and disquiet.\n\nOn the sixth day of this month falls the Red Grandson’s Day of Severance. This was addressed beforehand. Though the matter is now suspended, there is nothing further to fear. Yet the Four Marshals have turned against me, and I am confined within the capital’s禁. On that day, they will dispatch corpse-killing messengers to observe you. Though no further anxiety remains, on that day your parents will enter seclusion. Should illness arise during seclusion, it will bring no suffering. I, too, shall watch over you on that day.\n\nThe above three matters were spoken by the Lesser Mao Lord.\n\n*(The following three entries are recorded.)*\n\nOn the sixth day of the eighth month, when parents take their infant into seclusion to burn incense, face north, and present their pleas to the Two Lords, you will naturally witness something. What you see will bring no suffering whatsoever. At midday, the one who wore azure robes and patterned trousers the previous day will appear, lingering before the seclusion chamber—this is the Lesser Lord. You may approach and make your entreaties.\n\nAt midday on the sixth day of the eighth month, a man wearing a flat-topped cap, with long, flowing beard and mustache, dressed in purple leather trousers and an unlined jacket, will arrive leading a yellow-robed maiden. This man is Wang Yan, Marshal of the Ghostly Hosts. Yan acts for the benefit of others, bringing the maiden to be seen. On that day, the maiden may be bound. The scribe of the floral missive will, on that day, enter the well to assist the master. He will come at midday and depart shortly after.\n\nTherefore, you must vigorously direct the wind toward the grave and present the litigation talisman to repel the onslaught of poisonous qi. Do this three times, and the examiners will conceal themselves.\n\nThe scattering of obscuring mists and the deployment of examiners all arise from one’s failure to present offerings. The afflicted, gripped by fear, thus engage in inner warfare of essence and womb. Hence, maladies spread and erupt—not confined to a single body alone. The purpose of submitting the memorial is precisely to curb the expansion and contraction of the tiger’s fangs. Thus has it been expounded in the *Prophecies of Fan Zhonghou*.\n\n(Fan Zhonghou, whose given name is *Jinmao*, is the compiler of the *Southern Perfected Transmission*.)\n\nXu Hou ought to apologize for his deceit. The clerks and soldiers of the Lady of the Southern Perfected have so reported in the grand memorial.\n\nAs for the Lesser Lord: to employ the lesser in place of the greater—what further entreaties are needed? Should we petition the Most High to halt this? As for the Lesser Lord: are the fangs likewise? Hush, hush—you are but a disciple. What concern is Xu’s fang to you? How dare you pursue this further?\n\nThe maiden and Hou share a writ of water and fire. I have recently received the command of the Southern Perfected to thoroughly bind and seize them. A mere ghostly underling, ungovernable—what cause for worry? This, too, is what the Prefectural Secretary Xu has striven to overcome.\n\nAs for the Lesser Lord: Xu Hou is reproached by his father-in-law, and the reproach is severe. Yet he does not take heed of family matters or the comings and goings of guests. Such negligence is indeed deserving of censure. Why must this recur? This is the fault of the household elder’s strictures, not my doing. A solemn apology to the Dipper will surely bring release.\n\nMarshal Fan, in recent times, has grown weary of deceit and wishes no longer to involve himself in these affairs. I did not permit it. Now, there is no need for action. The deceitful must be swiftly healed and sent away. The Dipper, ever thirsty, drinks what must not be drunk; overfed, it grows sluggish and consumes what must not be eaten. The daughter-in-law is inattentive—yet she must not be left uninformed.\n\nIs this the reproach of a deceased father-in-law? Thus, one ought to be diligent in household affairs. Yet this persists without end. Might it lead to receiving instruction beneath the father-in-law’s roof? On the night of the second day of the eighth month, the Lesser Lord penned this letter and had it delivered to Master Fu. *(Right: ten items in Yang’s hand.)*\n\nThe messenger sent by Marshal Xu stole six dogs from another household and steamed them—*with fire*—beneath the marshal’s hearth to eat together. Why did the marshal not inspect this? The foul, rank qi tainted the meats and rice. Having eaten, they walked upon the road—this has already offended the Star of the Perfected One. There was a white dog; the common folk had prayed to the local earth deities with offerings to Xu. How could they have someone steal and boil it? The earth deity declared that Marshal Xu ordered this, not that petty men stole of their own accord. Secretly investigate this. You were beneath his roof and did not perceive it—how could such a thing occur? This is sufficient to be considered an illness. Be cautious.\n\nOn the night of the sixth day of the eighth month, the Lesser Lord of Mao wrote this to Marshal Xu. It is also fitting to address the Lady of the Southern Marchmount with words, entreating that illness be cured. Further, one ought to address the Two Lords of Life-Preservation and the Register of Destinies, with words akin to those for the Lady of the Southern Marchmount. The afflicted should personally petition the Dark Master for relief. Without this, recovery will not come.\n\nYiqian spoke of this recently on the Dao.\n\n[Separate Review]\n(These two characters are written on the back of the title paper)\n\nThe four clauses above were written by Yang. The petition of Nansheng Xu Yufu. Yufu, defiled by corpse impurity and tainted flesh, has received the sagely compassion of deliverance. Each edict of admonition bestowed is a profound grace upon his descendants. He constantly looks up in reverence to the numinous beneficence, forever relying on the celestial {vast shade}.\n\nYufu, with his dull and stubborn inferiority, is by nature difficult to instruct. Though he strives day and night, he remains plagued by transgressions and faults. This night, in a dream, he awakened to this realization. Reflecting on this, all is Yufu’s own culpability. Overwhelmed by shame and dread, he has no ground to stand upon.\n\nThe numinous Dao is lofty and empty; a man of flesh cannot yet grasp the true Dharma. He can only hold fast to sincerity and reverence, cultivating the precious mysteries. Yet he fears the numinous decree is too profound, the admonitions too subtle. Yufu, dull and benighted, cannot fully comprehend. Such sins accumulate day by day, and his violations of the precepts and commandments number in the thousands and tens of thousands.\n\nIf the Divine Mother, in her benevolence, would deign to pardon and absolve him once more, then today his anxiety and distress would be profound, his liver and gall shattered. He can only {break} his bones in remorse for his faults, though it does nothing to amend past wrongs. To repeatedly submit petitions and cause such trouble is unseemly, and his shame and fear compound.\n\nYufu pledges his sincerity and begs to swear an oath. From this day forward, he will purify his heart and renew his devotion, making covenant before Heaven and Earth. He will guard his form in stillness and follow the teachings with discipline. He begs for the pardon of his father Mu, his elder brother Huya, and all their transgressions, great and small. If Yufu has failed in his duties, he begs to bear the punishment himself. May all, great and small, be absolved.\n\nIf the Divine Mother would show mercy and permit Yufu to reflect on his faults and amend his errors, then his entire household, in perfect unity, would receive her grace. Thus, they would forever behold the Three Luminaries and be granted life anew.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nHere the text records Huya’s illness—this is Yuan’s farewell address to Nan Zhen. (Yuan himself copied this version.)\n\nHuya must be cautious never to tread again in dampness. Even seeing others newly afflicted by dampness startles the Three Origins into mourning. Dampness delights in killing men. On the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month, Nan Zhen declared:\n\nThose who study the Dao often fail to exercise caution in their affairs and thus bring upon themselves a hundred ailments. Yet they blame the gods and spirits. Lying exposed to wind and moisture, they reproach others for failing to shelter them—all fools, unfit to be taught the mysteries.\n\nPreserve life and warn Huya.\n\n*(The following two entries bear Yuan’s hand.)*\n\nMoments later, he intoned to himself:\nMorning blossoms gleam by the well at dawn,\nNine canopies tilt against azure clouds.\nBefore this, jade scepters were commonplace—\nI knew not the cedar among ten thousand streams.\nReleased in an instant from darkness,\nWhy must the guest of Yin be human?\n\n*(Some say this is a warning—if a warning, then let him change.)*\n\nLater that evening, Ying spoke:\nThose who see form cling to their allotted tasks in Confucianism and Mohism.\nThe sunken wanderer treads the words of mystery and chants of emptiness.\nSuch men may yet awaken—late or soon.\nDo the Xu brothers still have hearts?\nI fear only hollow ears.\nLet them try once more to comprehend—\nbeware the subtle path.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day of the ninth month, Mao Baoming declared:\nWhether this endeavor succeeds or fails depends entirely on you.\nThe Register Lord has spoken thus:\nTo betray inner truth is to break faith with the heart.\nThe three *hun* lose their authenticity;\nonce the true is scattered and confused,\nthe *po* seize the interval.\nOne who practices the Dao must ensure that inner and outer are as clear as mirrors,\npalace and note resonate in harmony,\nspirit moves within,\nand divinity descends without.\nThis is no empty claim.\nIn former days, I too was thus—\nall men smelted their hearts.\nNow that has ceased.\nThose who require smelting and reform remain in the lower ranks.\nHence my earnestness,\nmy hope that none linger here.\nLately, there has been some progress.\n\n*(These are the words of the Lesser Lord.)*\n\nWorldly affairs are not what I seek;\nwhy heed the turns of fate?\nThe man of the Dao will naturally be seen.\nDo not fret midway.\nI wished to inquire of Yang,\nand thus came to know—\nso I composed this.\n\n(Right: Qingling)\nThere is an opening for the perverse,\nand the perverse leaps through it.\nThis is not illness.\n\n(Right: An of Nine Flowers)\nThoughts ought not to be many.\nWhen many, the correct scatters.\nWith the correct scattered, to seek freedom from illness\nis like opening the gate to repel a fierce enemy.\n\n(Right: Ziwei)\nThe condition will naturally improve.\nDo not suffer.\nWords of the Lord of Life-Preservation:\nWhy reach the point of a house in mourning?\n\nWords of the Lord of Life-Preservation:\nOne may ingest talismans and drink water\nto be cured at once.\nFor those unwilling, it shall be granted.\n\nWords of the Lord of the Register of Destiny:\nIt will soon resolve itself.\n\nWords of the Lord of Life-Preservation:\nMuch has been said,\nand it is as stated.\nThe audience shall take place on the second day of the *yi* month.\nThe seventh matter is of no concern.\n\n(This line is Yang’s message to the Chief Clerk.)\nA jesting remark—\ndo not laugh at this, Chief Clerk Xu.\nThe expanse is unbounded, unconstrained;\nhigh and low lose their proper measure.\nStabilize it without doubt.\nIf no care is taken,\ndo not use this alone.\nGuard it from others’ eyes.\nGuard it from others’ eyes.\n\nOne line from the Lord of Life-Preservation to the Chief Clerk:\n\n(Right: Fourteen Written Instructions)\nIn declining years, the body grows frail,\noften assailed by wind and cold.\nOne must deeply nurture and preserve.\nIn this tranquil state, free of affairs,\nthe supreme flavor is the Mysterious Origin;\nabide in the Crimson Ford.\nThe body stills to utmost attainment,\nthe heart refines through inner contemplation.\nCast off the myriad burdens,\nwash away stray thoughts.\nOnly then does one draw near the gate.\n\nIf worries and entanglements are many,\nand worldly matters remain unexamined,\neven if one rests in the spirit’s emptiness,\ndwells in a heart of clarity,\nthe lingering coils will still not be transcended.\n\nTian Yu of Yuyang said:\nA man who, like a worn wheel in old age,\nis like a bell tolling the end of the night-watch\nyet still travels without rest,\nis a criminal.\nThis analogy applies to the old who indulge in desires,\nrushing about in trivial pursuits,\nkeeping company with the young.\nIf one can now vow never to act thus again,\nthen a swift recovery will follow.\nIf not, it shall be otherwise.\n\nThen can the ailment and the stages of age\nbe deliberated together with the heart?\n\n(Tian Yu, styled Guorang, was a native of Yongnu in Yuyang. A man of resourcefulness and strategy, he served as Inspector of Bingzhou and later as Minister of the Guards. In his old age, he sought to resign his post and wrote to Sima Xuanwang: \"To remain in office past seventy is like a bell tolling the end of the night-watch yet still traveling without rest—such a one is a criminal.\" He died at eighty-two, citing these words to urge his chief clerk to resign his position.)\n\nTake one of the four medicinal pills each day. Conduct yourself with care in all matters—this has already been repeatedly stated.\n\nThe above three entries are from Yang’s writings.\n\nFor those troubled by nightmares, at dawn the next day one should invoke the Most High, first to rectify the hun and po, and second to dispel inauspicious omens.\n\nHouseholds that uphold the Dao should meticulously maintain a tranquil abode.\n\nThe above two entries.\n\nAccording to ritual, at seventy one should \"hang up the carriage.\" \"Hanging up the carriage\" means that as the years wane like the sun nearing Yuanyuan, the body’s qi declines, and the spirit’s vitality begins to fade. One can no longer exhaust the physical form in the dust of the world or entangle the heart-mind with external things.\n\nNow that Attendant Xu has reached this stage, may he at last withdraw into reclusion? Returning to the Hall of Huayang to cultivate the arts of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi—while the summons from the Northern River still flies its banner and the honors of promotion remain resplendent—would this not be most joyous?\n\nAt present, this illness is on the mend. There is no cause for concern. Nevertheless, be cautious in engaging with the tumult of affairs, navigating the cold and heat of human matters. For now, do not yet stir from your place. If you do, people will say you fear ghosts.\n\n(The \"summons from the Northern River\" refers to the words of Dou, as recorded in the *Book of Changes*.)\n\nShould there appear hesitation in your resolve—this being the sixth month of the year, when I grew concerned for Attendant Xu’s condition, though it was no grave illness. This year, the ancestral spirits of the Xu clan have stirred in minor disturbances, yet no great suffering has arisen. Both Baoming and Fan Zhonghou have already made their appeals on his behalf, and Youfu of the Right Division has taken it deeply to heart. There is no cause for worry.\n\nThe juncture of departure or stay, the matter of life and death—these are secrets guarded by the Three Offices, not to be revealed to outsiders. That I speak of them now is only because you have already embraced the Supreme Dao within your heart-mind. For now, you may retain your official post; it is not yet time to resign. Whether to leave or remain—we shall deliberate further when the moment comes.\n\nThis was relayed by Zhonghou of the Right Division last night, and so I write it down to share with you.\n\nWhen a household encounters illness, death, decline, or misfortune—when strange lights appear, dreams trouble the mind, or wealth dwindles—these may be averted through rites of exorcism. Yet the most urgent matter is to resolve disputes over graves and ancestral curses. If these remain unresolved, calamity will persist without end.\n\nThis is the reply from Baoming to Attendant Xu.\n\n*True Instructions, Scroll Seven*\n*True Instructions, Scroll Eight*\n*Transmission of the Destined Mandate, Fourth Chapter*\n\nThe wanderings of spirits and the illusions of the unseen may not be trusted, yet excessive toil, excessive affairs, excessive thoughts, and excessive distractions wear down the spirit, scatter the true self, and disturb the Three Passes, thereby harming one’s luminous virtue. Thus, for those like Master Xu, to contain the inner radiance and restrain the four excesses, to refine emptiness and infuse the numinous—only then may immortality be hoped for. The Register of Fixed Destiny declares:\n\nPurify your bed and its surroundings, keep them clean and serene. Arrange your clothing and bedding with care, assigning a constant attendant. Burn incense regularly, letting its fragrance remain pure and untainted. The Perfected of the Southern Marchmount will often inspect your inner chambers—attend to your daily life accordingly.\n\nLet only grasses and quince be used. Your hands have long suffered from wind affliction—this is why the root of wind-qi has now reached your ears. Many say acupuncture and moxibustion bring excellent benefit, freeing one from worry. (This was spoken by Yi Qian to inform the Chief Clerk. The \"grasses and quince\" likely refer to the names of attendants responsible for clothing.)\n\nYou may summon Huang Min to come forth. Min’s servant wishes to come as well. It is also said that around the end of this month, you will suffer a minor illness. If you summon him here, the ailment will be dispelled. You must urgently prepare a quiet chamber and secure a room for rest. This year, you intend to gather grasses, but you should set them aside for Min’s servant. This year, the grasses themselves face their own life’s tribulation and should not be taken. Have him beg for a talisman to wear for self-protection.\n\nBehind the bed hangs a solitary wind-chime—place a screen to the north of it. (This should read as the character *zhang*, meaning \"screen.\") Alternatively, position the bed near the northern wall to avoid leaving it exposed. Morning and evening, focus your mind on reverent stillness, mentally performing the Daoist rites. (Since your body is unwell and you cannot bow or rise, maintain this mental practice without fail.)\n\nFu suffers from cholera. Do not let him eat cold food. This child is not well-suited to staying here, but no other harm will come to him.\n\nThe above was relayed by Yi Qian, who came twice in one night, speaking alone at the fourth watch. When he first arrived, he was accompanied by Bao Ming. (This appears to be the instruction given at the county office, ordering the clerk to return to the mountain and send Huang Min home. Yi Qian was the clerk’s mother, who after death entered the Yi Qian Palace and was thus called by that name. The previous appellations were also hers.)\n\nFu’s pursuit of the Dao is like digging a well. The deeper the well goes, the harder it is to haul the earth out. One must first lay bare one’s heart and rectify one’s conduct—only then can the source of the spring be glimpsed. Someone told this to Zhonghou; let him know of it. (Li Zhonghou, whose given name was Zun, was the author of *The Biographies of the Three Lords of Mao*.)\n\nA person’s study of the Dao is like a journey of ten thousand li. As one approaches each place along the way, cold and heat, good and ill, grasses and trees, waters and soils—nothing will not be encountered and witnessed. This, too, is a trial within it. Recently, I have heard others speak of this, and only now have I come to understand.\n\nThat gentleman’s thoughts and longings are many. (The character *qu* should read *ju*.) Can he truly fulfill his distant aspirations? In times past, he often harbored many regrets, only now realizing how difficult it is to become a true person—and that virtue must never be lost.\n\nIt is said that those who study the Dao must first remove their faults and reproach themselves for them. Examine this carefully and be diligent.\n\nThe above was spoken by Lady Yi Qian.\n\nWhen the qi of mountains and peaks is disturbed, mighty birds cry out in the forests. When rivers and streams are blocked and stagnant, dragons and serpents grow desolate in the marshes. This is the natural pattern of things.\n\nThus, when the powerful and flourishing show the slightest sign of decline, it is as if beasts warn of their coming calamity. Subtle omens in the mysterious reckoning, like the cries of heralds, foretell order or chaos. This is the waxing and waning of mountains and rivers—it is not the fortune or misfortune of human affairs.\n\nIf tombs cling to hills and mountains, they truly share the same waves as the peaks. Yet should one’s choices and rejections stray from principle, the workings of the myriad winds will differ. Without stillness and compliance, one cannot grasp humility; without empty dwelling, one cannot achieve profound union. Thus, the pivot of life and death—even the wise do not presume to foresee it. Yet if one’s thoughts remain free of deviation, no misfortune or harm will arise.\n\nFifteenth day of the fifth month.\nThe above was spoken by Lady Ying in reply to [Kong’s inquiry].\n\n*(Later hands obscurely wrote \"Xie An\" in place of the name. Kong refers to Kong Mo. It appears to be Kong Yan, his brother. The Prefect’s father had once served as vanguard commander under Yan’s elder cousin Tan during the campaign against Shen Chong. Given this connection, this exchange was possible.)*\n\nRegarding the matter of tigers roaring near graves in recent times—if one has not yet attained harmony of spirit and stillness of form, or bowed to nurture hidden essence, might the source of illness accumulate with the years? For those yet unable to tread the path of *jiaoyu*, why hasten so urgently toward medicine?\n\nRecord of the Immortal’s reply to Kong’s request for a prescription:\nI trust your elder brother has been buried early. Now that the smoke of the offering has swiftly dispersed, though it does not [impede] the living, it is essential to obtain burial goods to pacify the three springs below, so that the baleful *qi* may dissolve and grow still.\n\nA remedy for the child’s illness will be sent shortly.\n\nSeventeenth night of the fifth month.\nWords of the Life-Preserving Immortal Lord.\n\nTo the one whose surname may yet be Kong, who inquired of illness and suffering—\n\n*(To the right, nineteen entries from recent years, all bearing the seal of the clerk’s office.)* With reverent heart and fragrant incense, you have turned with feeling toward medicine. Thus there are words of \"dissolving and grinding\" to cure illness—might you, upon hearing this, seek life’s mandate? *(The Perfected Immortals all call medicine \"dissolving and grinding,\" hence the term \"Dissolving and Grinding Sutra.\" Reciting it may also dissolve illness.)* Yet you rush south while your heart races north—mouth and mind already at odds.\n\nTo cast aside the water-chestnut and feast on the bitter herb, to scorn the ninefold elegance of courtly music while delighting in the rustic tunes of the northern wilds—*(From \"cast aside the water-chestnut\" to this point echoes the parables of the* Baopuzi*)*—I know you lack the discernment to hear the harmony of the true tone. May you ever remain a fortunate man, extending this grace to your mother and servants.\n\nYet the root of this lies in learning without reflection, digging a well without clearing its depths—merely a minor flaw in one of flesh. Is this not the case? Now the matter is bound by water taboos, though there remains room for appeal. If Prefect Xu can, in stillness, act as one who rescues, then the entire household will be preserved. Is this not also a fitting request for the Master of Ceremonies and Libationer to bestow as a virtuous favor?\n\nTwentieth night of the fifth month.\nWritten by Youying for the Prefect.\n\n*(Liu Zunzu was skilled in discourse; Yin Hao once praised him to Guangyu Liang. Yet in a later gathering, their discussions diverged entirely.)*\n\nThus it was named \"Master Sheep's Crane.\" *(Here the name is lost.)* Liu Zun’s heart was ever set on cultivation. Why not have his mother take the *Far-Reaching Aspiration Pill*?\n\nOn the seventh night of the seventh month, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity spoke. She was asked whether the prescription could be obtained. After a long while, she answered: \"It already exists in the world. Seek it in secret and use it.\" The Lord of Life Preservation asked the Lady of the Purple Tenuity: \"This formula requires bezoar and silver filings—without these, it would be difficult to compound.\" *(This is the present-day Great Heart-Settling Pill. First, mercury is used to grind the silver filings until they dissolve, which makes the process difficult.)* The Lady of the Purple Tenuity replied: \"Simply nod in assent.\"\n\n*(The above three entries are from Yang’s writings.)*\n\nThe Lu brothers, Na and Shi, were pure, sincere, and undivided, possessing the manner of Jiang Bozi. Knowing of their desire for *far-reaching aspiration*, they rejoiced. Their grandfather had accumulated hidden virtue, and blessings were to flow through seven generations. It was known that Lu Gouzi had vowed to undertake a year of ascetic fasting in order to receive the scriptures. *(The words \"you yourself\" were later added by someone—spurious.)* \"Consider it further.\" Liu Zun had a good heart and early self-awareness.\n\nThe Lord of Life Preservation answered Prefect Xu. *(Lu Na’s elder brother was named Shi, and both were of virtuous conduct. Their grandfather was named Ying.)*\n\nLu served as Prefect of Danyang Commandery in the state of Wu. *Gouzi* was likely his childhood name, though his full identity remains unclear. Na later became President of the Imperial Secretariat and died in the twentieth year of the *Taiyuan* era.\n\nYu Zhao handled affairs for his *nephew* (these two characters were later altered to \"ancestor\" by someone—though the original remains discernible). Entangled in official documents, he was arrested and detained, the case dragging on without resolution, nearly beyond all reason. Fortunately, he had accumulated some merit and virtue in his lifetime, and his family possessed strong blessings. Petitions piled up, all reaching the throne, and the matter was eventually dismissed. Soon after, he was pardoned and sent home. Though his illness was severe, he felt no distress. Lord Xu was deeply concerned for him and secretly conveyed his support.\n\nThe Lord of Life Preservation answered Prefect Xu:\n\nGuangyu Daoji, holding high office in the world of light, failed to align with Heaven in applying the law. Arrogant and reckless, his heart and conduct were at odds. From youth to adulthood, he performed not a single good deed, amassing evil without repentance. His offenses are already recorded. Now, facing the end of his life, he seeks to cultivate virtue to save himself—wasting a thousand gold in vain. Is it not too late?\n\nGuangyu Yuehe, styled Daoji, was the second son of Liang. From childhood, he possessed talent in rhetoric and literary composition. During the Shengping era, he served as Prefect of Danyang, submitting memorials to abolish over sixty corvée labors for the various marquises. At the beginning of the Taihe era, he became Commandant of the Army. Such conduct does not resemble that of an evildoer. Perhaps he heard warnings and cultivated goodness, thus securing his reprieve.\n\nYet Xiyi Hui’s father, without cause, slaughtered hundreds of people and seized their wealth and treasures. His transgressions were grave and his retribution severe. The aggrieved spirits (originally written as *yuan*, meaning \"resentment\") constantly lodged complaints, and the celestial bureaus had long since settled the case. By law, Hui’s entire family should have been exterminated. However, since his cultivation of virtue was profound, he alone escaped. How could his descendants be spared? Hui may preserve his natural lifespan, but the affairs of the immortal Dao are far beyond his reach.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Great Primordial answered Prefect Xu:\n\nXiyi Hui’s father, Jian, was frugal and upright, with noble aspirations. He should not have committed such killings and plunder. Perhaps this occurred when he first crossed the river...\n\nThis was likely the result of his entanglement in the chaos of war. Otherwise, it must have been during his time in the capital when he killed bandits indiscriminately. Jian lived to over seventy before passing away, having attained an official position.\n\n[The following four clauses, transcribed by hand, were brought by Lu Na from the right:]\n\nBalanced and serene in substance, profound and wondrous in spirit,\nHis divine craftsmanship surpasses all bounds—\nHe dwells in truth and nurtures life.\nIn the Great Mystery, he plants his bamboo slips;\nIn the Great Simplicity, his name is inscribed.\nWithin, his radiance illumines the Golden Court;\nWithout, his luster polishes the Jade Splendor.\nWith crimson chariots drawn by four steeds, he summons the host of spirits,\nGalloping through the Dark Realm of the Dragon, soaring on clouds through the ethereal void.\nSurely he shall befriend the lords of the Leisure Terrace above,\nAnd oversee the governance of the Great Purity below.\n\nOn the night of the seventeenth day of the eighth month, the Lady Wang of the Purple Tenuity bestowed this teaching, instructing Prefect Xu to convey it to Hui.\n\nHui, your brilliance shines afar, your hidden resonance congeals in mystery.\nThe lofty melody ascends, yet you linger in dreams, fleeing from truth.\nGaze upward to soar through the clouds and mist,\nLook downward to scatter the roots of spirit.\nWith flying steps, you traverse the Four Awakenings;\nInwardly, you contemplate the Seven Conditions—\nThen you shall surely receive the vermilion script and elegant bamboo slips of the Emperor’s chamber,\nYour dark voice resounding in eight directions,\nYour body dwelling upon the Five Peaks.\nThus, bathe the embryo and pay homage to the Origin,\nExhale and inhale the Six Fluids,\nMove with ease through the Three Paths,\nAnd instruct this luminous blessing.\nAbove, you may ride the empty vastness of the chariot of space;\nBelow, you may reverse the blossoming of youth and transform blackened hair.\nYet if your form is ensnared by the net of glory,\nIf you churn the wheels in the garden of splendor,\nIf you ride the waves to chase after things,\nIf your jade hairpin chimes in the wind and dust of the world—\nOutwardly bearing the name of one who seeks the Dao,\nInwardly beset by a hundred worries—\nYou will merely exhaust your heavenly years in restless thought,\nAnd in the end, return your bones to the Three Bureaus.\nIf your fasting is not wholehearted,\nYour awakening will be in vain.\nCan this be called a mind that does not exhaust its words?\n\nNow, to practice truth:\nOne must exhale the Three and inhale the Four,\nRide the Seven and swallow the Nine.\nYet now, your breath is insufficient,\nYour steps disordered.\nThe spirit leaks, flowing back to its source;\nEssence scatters, the embryo disturbed.\nThough you may fast for days,\nYou know not the Dao, and your years are lost.\nDo you wish to ascend this crossing?\nYou have not yet grasped it.\n\nThose who seek long life are many as the ford’s waters;\nThose who tread the path of the numinous are countless as the sands.\nWhy must you use an ice vessel to hold fire,\nOr hasten to repay debts to the Three Bureaus?\n\nThe words of the Central Lord, conveyed by Prefect Xu to Hui.\n\nThe Lady of the Purple Tenuity says: If Hui attains the Dao, he shall become a supervisor of the Great Purity. Should he heed the essential teachings and practice diligently, he may reach this rank. But if he is not single-minded and steadfast, if he clings to delusion and strays from the Dao’s methods, abandoning them outwardly—then all will be lost.\n\n[The preceding words of the Purple Tenuity differ markedly from those of the Great Primordial, as seen in what follows.]\n\nIs it that Hui’s delusion prevents him from diligently pursuing the essential Dao? This is why the Director of Destinies reveals his ultimate fate. Only when no other thoughts remain does the Dao draw near. Is Hui’s turning still insufficient to discuss the supreme Dao?\n\n(The Lesser Lord says:) Hui’s paternal grandmother, Ding Shuying, possessed the hidden virtue of aiding the destitute. When she encountered Zhao Fu’s calamity, she did not speak of it. Her inner compassion arose from within, and the numinous responded to her humanity—thus her blessings extended to Hui, inclining him toward the love of immortality. Her tomb lies in Dongping. Shuying now serves as a Consort of the Vermilion Mound, often wandering the Three Peaks, where the Director of Destinies has also permitted her to attend to governance.\n\n(These two were likely Hui’s great-grandparents, though external records do not make this clear.)\n\nHui’s forebears, Qu and Xue Chunhua, devoted their hearts to the ancestral lineage, never concerning themselves with worldly affairs. Yet litigants were many, and they could not restrain them all. Whenever they saw those who came to remonstrate or lodge grievances, they treated them with utmost care. Should seasonal rites be offered to them? These two are the protective spirits of Hui’s household.\n\n(External records also lack mention of these two; their relation to Hui is unknown.)\n\nHui’s elder brother, Xiong, and his wife, the daughter of Yan Qu, remain bound to the labor of carrying stones—a debt unfulfilled to this day. They delight in assaulting the ancestral lineage.\n\nTheir hearts ever bent on slaughter and annihilation—these two are the calamity-spirits of Hui’s household. Hui (this name cannot be deciphered beyond this) and Yin Wuji were subjected to judicial torture for burning and killing Zhu She and Li Jian, thereby inviting disaster. They left no descendants, yet still sought substitutes to suffer in their stead. They further conspired with Gao Feng, vigorously aiding the litigation of Matou against Shi Gong. No favorable outcome could be secured, and the matter seemed boundless. Why, then, did they persist in deceiving their wives? Though they came with earnest pleas, one might attempt to suppress and rectify their ways—but none of these individuals exist in the records.\n\nThe following is the response of the Protector of Life to Prefect Xu:\nThe Lady Minor reports: Hui Jian now resides in the Three Offices, sued by Liu Jijiang over a dispute concerning the Three Virtues. Zhou Matou, in the Water Office, litigates against her son-in-law, presenting a most grievous argument. Hui Lang and Yi Xiang—these two are now sought by the girl Ya Nuqi. Marshal Fan recently received the complaint of Jiang Luo. Hui Xiang is presently detained by the clerks of the Grand Court; his wife, Xing Yingtao, remains entangled in the case, still seeking a substitute from this household.\n\n[The preceding was merely an informal hearing of the Lady Minor’s words and was not to be recorded. It is noted here only for personal reference.]\n\n(These twenty-two characters are Yang Jun’s personal note to the Prefect:) In his advanced years, Gao Ling has reverted to childlike frailty. The Dao and qi no longer intermingle; his spirit lacks a guiding presence. Thus, a host of malevolent forces assail his essence, hastening calamity. Why not embrace the principle of *shengsheng* (generative vitality)? For me, aiding him holds karmic affinity. His wife, too, speaks urgently of household matters—these must be resolved, for no outsider may intervene.\n\nNow, the Six Heavens’ tyranny runs rampant, while the Great Peace’s influence wanes. Spirits insufficient to aid the upright instead summon a throng of {treacherous women}. Thus, divine radiance scatters, and evil usurps the rightful path. Gao Ling’s lack of virtue has long been evident; the entanglements of ghostly litigation have piled high.\n\nPrefect Xu—(Huang Shi writes this as “clerk”)—do you intend to set this aright? If you promptly submit to Master Zhang Hui’s teachings, I shall grant you a talisman to ingest. Thus, he will surely recover and {harm be dispelled}. Otherwise, proceed to the Water Office.\n\nAlas, what sorrow! (Zhang Hui is the name of the Celestial Master; Yang does not wish to write it explicitly.) When pernicious qi invades the body and ghosts congest the chest, how can one turn from delusion to discern the true and false? How then could one uphold the Orthodox Unity amid the qi of equilibrium? In such a case, my method for treating illness may well prove unattainable. (The Orthodox Unity and qi of equilibrium refer to the transformation wrought by the Celestial Master’s libationers.)\n\nIf he departs, his son will also leave—why must this one life pass forever? On the night of the nineteenth day of the eighth month, the Lord of Life Preservation secretly addressed Prefect Xu: the litigation over the tomb grows ever more severe, and I fear it will not cease. Ling once defaced the inscriptions on ancient steles to aggrandize himself, deceiving spirits and gods. He {obscured} virtue to exalt himself, and thus the plaintiffs have multiplied their grievances, placing this matter first.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month, the Lord of Life Preservation spoke again: he wished to appoint Xie Feng to the post of Gentleman of the Expectant Gate, but another has already been assigned to the position. The Northern Emperor has temporarily suspended the appointment. Recently, Wang Yunzhi was appointed to act in the role and has since been replaced. If Feng ingests the *Atractylodes* wine, he need not yet comply with the summons. Gao Qi may also take *Atractylodes*. The litigation over his family’s tomb has likewise become chaotic. *Atractylodes* repels ghosts, so there will surely be no further trouble. Fan the Marquis of the Interior spoke of this. (Xie Feng, styled Hongdao, was a native of Kuaiji who rose to become Prefect of Wu Commandery, Governor of Danyang, and Minister of Personnel.)\n\nWang Yunzhi, of the same clan as his cousin Wang Shu’s son, was a man of wisdom and administrative ability. He served as General of the Central Army of Henan and Governor of Jiangzhou, later promoted to Defender-in-Chief and Governor of Kuaiji, enfeoffed as Marquis of Panyu. He died at the age of forty and was posthumously honored as the Loyal Marquis. Gao Qi was also known as Gao Ling.\n\n(Note on *Gentleman of the Expectant Gate*: a central court office, though this title does not appear in the records—only *Gentleman of the Xiumen* is attested.) Fourteen entries have been transcribed from Pingning’s compilation.\n\nTo observe things and assign them their proper roles, to inwardly align with the luminous spirits, to entrust one’s nature and life to the lofty perfected, and to commit one’s form and *qi* to divine oversight—this is how one strengthens the far-reaching and preserves the authentic for an autumn’s span. Now that the master of virtue has settled his spirit upon trust, clarified his mind in serene stillness, and embraced reverence with perfect compliance, he is surely favored by Heaven. Yet his descendants are few, and some may yet fade away—perhaps the numinous gateway has lost its weft, and the hidden mechanism remains unsettled.\n\nIn this era, the five *qi* radiate their brilliance, ever illuminating the chambers of Wen Chang. The Three Stars weave their splendor, each time adorning the *jade pivot* within. Thus the mysterious moisture nurtures the embryo, and its roots flow forth. According to the *Inner Records of the Nine Unions*, the bamboo is the essence of the Northern Mechanism, receiving *qi* from the constellation of the Dark Chariot. Its hollow roundness and inner purity, its layered yin enfolding whiteness—all arise from deep roots spreading their fruit, binding abundance in profusion.\n\nCommand the lord to plant bamboo beyond the northern chamber of the inner residence, that the fair ones may wander beneath it. Thus shall Heaven stir the numinous mechanism, and descendants greatly increase. Pregnancies shall be preserved whole, and births shall be long-lived. The subtle and manifest shall flourish, ever guarding propitious purity. This is the secret rule of the profound ones, and those who practice it find it most efficacious.\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the sixth month, the Lady of the Mid-Candidate addressed the lord:\n*(Emperor Xiaowu was born in a renxu year—this should correspond to a xinyou year. Later, it is said: \"The seat of the Grand Minister stirs,\" and thereafter he ascends the throne, which would be in a houwu or wei year. This discrepancy is vast.)*\n\nThe numinous herb and the *Guangyin* esoteric method, gazing upward, receive the essence of the revolving luminaries. *(The characters \"洗洗\" appear to be a marginal note beside \"竹,\" likely a variant of \"言先,\" echoing the meaning of the *Mao Odes* line: \"The locusts’ wings flutter—may your sons and grandsons be as numerous.\")* Flourishing and luxuriant, its sprouts abound; layered virtue must surely prosper. Composed by the Lady of Purple Tenuity: \"Fortune and Harmony shall bear two sons, their abundant virtue destined for the age.\" *(Fortune and Harmony seems to have been the humble childhood name of Lady Li; in the *Book of Jin*, she is called Junrong. The two sons are Emperor Xiaowu and his younger brother, Daoji.)*\n\nThat same night, the Mid-Candidate spoke again:\n*(The following three entries are in Yang’s hand, later transcribed by an aide.)*\n\n\"Since the virtuous artisan has already concentrated his spirit and the profound model descends from Heaven, matters of safety or peril ought not yet be inquired into. The lord’s devotion is most earnest; that I have not yet reciprocated is because foreknowledge of events is difficult to discuss.\"\n\nOf late, the celestial *qi* has surged wildly, and the shadows of yin have shifted repeatedly. Venus has sundered its form between the two celestial markers, its turbulence seething beneath the Purple Chamber. The king detests this; the Son of Heaven has cause for concern. The seat of the Grand Minister stirs. Now I offer a cryptic verse in secret counsel:\n*(The following passage and the cryptogram were transcribed by an aide, appended to his own record of revisions on the same sheet. The original text is woven in a circular pattern, making it difficult to decipher. Here, the lines are extracted and arranged sequentially, though the transmission was likely oral, with Yang later altering the interpretation. All pertain to affairs of the Jin dynasty, with clear corroboration.)*\n\n---\n*Is deception the subtle essence of the Way?*\n*Must I reveal Heaven’s secrets?*\n*There is an art of ten thousand gold measures—*\n*Seek a master swiftly to expel the rebellious and evil child.*\n*From this, govern the barbarians and pacify the age;*\n*Heaven’s mandate rides forth, the treasure borne aloft.*\n*O wondrous dragon, how sorrowful!*\n*Between the ages, one must ponder what is fitting.*\n*The divine radiance reverses its course;*\n*The reckoning lies here—whether there is or is not, none can say.*\n*Who shall quell the surging armies and stabilize the imperial house?*\n*Be cautious of the earth, for the royal chamber draws near.*\n*The elder son shall perish first, his metal flawed;*\n*Fivefold chaos arises, virtue in disarray.*\n*The fire’s number misses its time; the throne shall shift—*\n*From afar, omens of misfortune appear, the artisan’s design unravels.*\n*Threefold the rule, yet the artisan’s footing is unsure;*\n*No need to fear distant perils—pluck them out, secure the fief.*\n*Inch by inch, its depths are unfathomable;*\n*Liu Xiang alone discerns the signs of what is to come.*\n\n*Three and five, the auspicious portents of Heaven’s era—*\n*Prosperity and change alternate, cycling in succession.*\n*Essence, qi, and spirit—subtle and wondrous, they join the Two Modes.*\n*Beware of transmitting them to the common or the wise;*\n*To the worthy alone should they be bestowed.*\n\n*Seal Heaven, govern Earth—nothing is amiss.*\n*If you, child, can treasure and conceal it, Heaven shall know.*\n*Is the essence of my Way subtle and wondrous?

curse.\nNightmares shall cease utterly.\nEver guard the Three Passes—this is most excellent.\n\nThe Right Radiance spoke to the Duke.\n(Wherever \"Duke\" appears, it refers to when Emperor Jianwen served as Prime Minister.)\n\nThe following is a passage from Yang’s writings,\n(the five characters written in red):\n\nThe Perfected of the Great Prime spoke to Director Xu:\n(What follows is not the true teaching.)\n\nI once met Le Zichang of Nanyang,\na man of unadulterated simplicity.\nHe neither sought a master nor received instruction,\nbut followed Heaven and entrusted himself to fate.\nHe knew nothing of the methods for cultivating life,\nyet his conduct never transgressed evil.\nHis virtue harmonized with the natural,\nand though he did not attain longevity,\nat death he ascended to the Hall of Blessings.\nRefining his spirit and receiving qi,\nhis name was recorded in the Emperor’s register.\nThus he was appointed Attendant of the Gate of Cultivation,\nranked just below the immortals.\nThis was due to his inborn destiny,\nas well as the accumulated virtue of his ancestors,\nwhose flowing blessings had shaped him.\n\nHad he but roughly understood the principles of nurturing life\nand received even a single word of the Supreme’s secret,\nthen in seeking the Dao,\nnothing would have eluded him.\n\nThe reason people do not fulfill their allotted years,\nbut often meet untimely ends in the world,\nis that some encounter the calamities of war,\ncutting short their glory and emolument,\nor leaving their descendants without posterity.\n\nThose who aspire to the Dao,\nthough they harbor lifelong devotion\nand ceaselessly seek with diligence,\nmay still encounter true scriptures,\ndelving into the profound and subtle mysteries.\nMany admire such pursuits,\nyet few attain ascension.\n\nThe scriptures are not without wonder,\nnor do the numinous lack response.\nBut the foolish follow one another blindly,\nunaware of the root of cultivating the true,\nor the methods of nurturing the spirit, fostering nature, and securing stability.\n\nFrom youth onward,\nmany incur harm within their forms.\nThe First Emperor of the body is not governed,\nand the hundred spirits scatter in alarm.\nTen thousand trials arise—\nthis is what is meant by the overgrown city,\nwhere thorns flourish within.\n\nWithout wondrous arts to guide oneself,\nor the cultivation of the Dao to seek immortality,\none may covet glory and yearn for nobility,\nonly to fail when on the verge of success.\nAll this stems from losing the true and violating qi,\nblind and benighted,\nunable to recognize this mechanism.\n\nThus years are stolen, lives extinguished,\nand ten thousand affairs come to naught.\nSuch is the path to seeking life.\n\nThe distance from life grows ever greater—\nall is but vain self-affliction.\nThe Supreme possesses the Dao of the Mysterious Mechanism,\nthe essentials of the *Seven Spirits in the Pillow* gleaming forth.\nThis Dao is subtle, wondrous indeed!\nAt first, it was not transmitted to the dull and vulgar below.\nThose who possess this Dao:\nthe First Emperor governs within the Mysterious Palace,\nthe ten thousand spirits stand guard,\nand the heart aligns with Heaven.\nFollowing the formulas with care and cultivating it,\none may ascend mountains and cross seas—\nten thousand trials cannot touch them.\nCultivating immortality and ascending in transcendence,\nall desires follow the heart.\nIs this mere empty speech?\n\nYour father and son have inherited the Mysterious Mechanism through the generations,\nmastering its principles to connect with the true.\nThus, your divine talents in spirit-cultivation\nare praised by the host of perfected beings—\nnot by my acclaim alone.\nTherefore, I shall inscribe you together in the *Records of Immortals*,\nfree from any suspicion beyond reason.\nI have already consulted you on this,\nso you may know my heart.\nReceive and employ the *Golden Dragon and Jade Fish*—\nthis cannot be omitted.\nThe reason for this is that when you appear before the Supreme,\nyour numinous radiance must be somewhat prepared.\n\nThe *Divine Tiger Talisman* recently transcribed\nseems to me insufficiently refined—\nit would be best to rewrite it well.\nRegarding the matter of *Xiang* and *Wang* you mentioned earlier,\nwhen I recently met with *Xiyi*,\nI also sensed good intentions,\nthough what was achieved was modest.\nStill, you may naturally preserve your heavenly years.\n\nI have seen the *Biographies* you composed—\nno easy labor—\nyet you were able to narrate the sacred traces,\nunraveling and crafting marvels.\nThis is Heaven stirring your heart.\nYesterday, I also met with the Lord of Life and Destiny,\nwho greatly approved.\nIn the unseen realm, it shall surely be repaid to those with karmic affinity.\nIf your descendants know how to *burn incense and summon the Sacred Peaks*,\npraying to the Heavenly Perfected,\ntheir responses will surely descend.\nIs this empty speech?\n\nThe Xie family, through the Tang and Chen dynasties,\nhas flourished like a luxuriant forest—\nmost gratifying indeed!\nAs for Anshi’s earlier audience,\nwhat was bestowed is as we recently discussed in person.\nThere is no need to elaborate further.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Wang of Western City’s reply to Marquis Xu.\nThe above four sections are a separate handwritten letter,\nlater obtained by Lu Xiujing in Dongyang.\nThey are not of the same origin as the other traces,\nand their diction and matters appear crude and spurious.\n\nThese do not align with the true purport—\nlikely composed by later hands.\nYue Zichang was not one who received the Five Talismans.\nThe \"Tang and Chen\" refers to the forty-sixth *dinghai* cycle recorded in the *Annals*.\n\n*True Reports*, Scroll Eight.\n*True Reports*, Scroll Nine.\n\"Harmonizing with the Prosperous Cycle,\" Section One.\n\nThe scripture states:\nWhen performing the rites,\nface north while holding the *Hidden Writ*—\nthis is for those who have just begun to study the wondrous Dao,\nwho have not yet ventured into subtleties afar,\nwho do not comprehend the cardinal directions of stellar positions,\nnor recognize the pointing of the Mystic Dipper.\nThus, they must face north while holding the text to gradually seek understanding.\nOnce the meaning of the text is grasped,\nand the turning of the stars with the seasons is known,\none should naturally follow the Dipper’s pointing,\nproceeding and pacing accordingly.\nIn this way, there is no fixed direction—\nnot always facing north.\nFacing north in all cases\nis only for beginners.\nPerhaps this can be understood by analogy—\nother such matters need not be asked again.\n\n(This answers the inquiry of the Chief Clerk regarding the meaning of facing north while holding the text in the *Scripture on Soaring Steps*.)\n\nThe Most High Perfected’s method of pacing the Way of the Five Stars\nbrings the Five Stars to descend into the chamber.\nHolding the breath to ascend the net,\none must first invoke the names of the Five Star Ladies.\nOnly then may one cross the net and tread upon the stars.\nThis means that upon first ascending the net,\none pauses to invoke the names.\nAfter invoking the names,\none then crosses the net and treads upon the stars.\nIf, upon reaching each star,\none can once more silently invoke the name of the star’s position,\nit is all the better.\nIf this becomes cumbersome and difficult to maintain consistently...\n\nSimply follow the established method as before. In ancient times, Master Yushagong, Beili Zichang, and the Old Man of Changling all ascended to heaven by adhering to this practice, never shirking its demands on account of difficulty. This is what is meant by \"managing one’s livelihood.\" Merchants and traders toil ceaselessly—do they shrink from peril or hardship? Their sole aim is profit. If seekers of the Dao were to apply themselves with the same devotion as merchants, what could prevent them from attaining immortality?\n\nYet it is lamentable that beginners often claim to be wholly devoted at first, only to grow lax over time. Even if they persist, it is as though a cart’s axle is about to break, its every joint loosening and falling apart; or like an ox burdened with a heavy load, struggling to take each step on a long journey. Such are the pitfalls that plague learners, and the very things that those who have attained the Dao mock. If one can instead refine the inner mirror of the heart, this will stir the numinous. Then, divine beings will dispel your ignorance and bear you away in the chariot of celestial radiance.\n\n*(This answers the inquiry regarding the method of pacing the Five Stars. The scriptural illustrations only mention moving along the net to and fro, while another method speaks of crossing the net to tread upon the stars—this passage now clarifies the matter. Its words of encouragement and admonition are truly incisive.)*\n\nThe Five Stars diagram is always oriented toward the south, with Venus positioned in the west and Jupiter in the east. This arrangement is followed in practice, and the reason is thus.\n\nThe Five Stars conceal and emerge, shifting without constancy, unlike the Northern Dipper, whose stellar forms remain ever fixed. Thus, one must establish positions according to the five directions, rather than following the stars’ transient locations. *(This answers the inquiry regarding the proper placement of the Five Stars diagram. The scriptures contain no definitive instructions, hence the need for this clarification.)*\n\nThe Three Eights’ Radiance and the Twenty-Four Spirits may be visualized in sequence, or all three Eights may be summoned at once. Alternatively, one may contemplate the Upper Radiance at dawn, the Middle Radiance at noon, and the Lower Radiance at midnight—this is left to the practitioner’s discretion. If one retreats to secluded cliffs, severs worldly affairs, inwardly focuses on the spirit-gates, and draws in the true qi, then at dawn all three Eights’ Radiance may be summoned at once, while at the other two times, each Radiance may be contemplated again in turn—this would be most excellent. Yet in the human realm, affairs are manifold, and such diligence is difficult to sustain. If the practice cannot be maintained, its benefits will naturally diminish.\n\nThe Western City’s Perfected Lord Wang and the Supreme Realized of Mount Tongbai both followed this Way. As recorded in the *Pao Xuan Yu* {*Bamboo Records*} and the *White Tablets and Azure Scriptures*: \"One who does not visualize the Twenty-Four Spirits nor knows the names of the Three Eights’ Radiance...\"\n\nOne who fails to visualize the Twenty-Four Spirits and does not know the names of the Three Eights’ Radiance shall not become a citizen of Great Peace, nor shall they serve as a minister to future sages. (This answers the intent of cultivation and visualization in the *Scripture of the Twenty-Four Spirits*, and is also a secret formula. The four formulas above are now found in a copy transcribed by the Chief Clerk. It is unknown which Perfected One Yang consulted for this—if not the Eastern Minister, then it must have been the Southern Perfected of Purple Tenuity.)\n\nThese are the essential secret practices compiled by the Most High Perfected. (The transcribed copy by the Chief Clerk bears this title. These are still the key methods taught by the assembled Perfected in their transmitted scriptures, matters of rejuvenation and reversing aging. The Chief Clerk was merely instructed to put them into practice—this is not a single completed scripture.)\n\nThe *Scripture of Great Simplicity and Cinnabar Radiance* states: On the face, one should always rub both hands until warm, then massage the face thoroughly, following its contours in all directions. This will make the face luminous, preventing wrinkles and blemishes. After five years of practice, the complexion will resemble that of a young maiden. This is called \"the qi of mountains and rivers flowing freely, ever full and never depleted.\" First, rub the palms together until hot, then wipe both eyes. Next, stroke the hair in a combing motion. The arms should also be massaged alternately with the hands to prevent hair from whitening and veins from rising to the surface. This passage is from the middle scroll of the *Scripture of Cinnabar Radiance*. (This scripture has not yet been revealed to the world; it belongs to the lower rank of Perfected texts.)\n\nThe *Essential Radiance and Massage Section* of the *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: Upon rising or retiring, sit upright. First, clasp the hands and place them behind the neck. Then tilt the head back to look upward, lifting the neck so that it strains against the hands. Repeat this three or four times to harmonize the essence, circulate the blood, and prevent wind-qi from entering. With long practice, one will neither die nor fall ill. Next, bend and stretch the body, extending the limbs to their utmost. Arch backward, twist to the sides, and shake all joints—each movement performed three times. These are oral instructions. (This exercise follows a sequential method, hence the need for oral transmission to refine it. It is also the art of \"bear-hanging and bird-stretching.\")\n\nUpon rising, first use a handkerchief or thick cloth to wipe the neck on all sides and behind the ears.\n\nLet the warmth encircle fully until it radiates gently. Stroke the neck along the flow of the hair, as if combing it countless times. After a long while, rub both hands together and then treat the face and eyes. With long practice, this will brighten the eyes, prevent pathogenic qi from invading, and keep the body free from greasy filth and grime.\n\nWhen all is complete, swallow saliva twenty times to guide the inner fluids.\n\n*(The above passage is from the first scroll of the* **Great Cavern Scripture of Essence and Radiance***, which has not yet been revealed to the world and is not among the Three Grades.)*\n\nThe *Scripture of the Supreme Numinous for Dispelling Demons* states: If the body feels unwell, press the tongue against the throat, rinse the mouth, and swallow saliva without count. In a short while, the discomfort will vanish, and one will feel the body relaxed and supple.\n\n*(The above passage is from the* **Preface to the Scripture of the Supreme Numinous for Dispelling Demons***, which has not yet been revealed to the world and is not among the Three Grades. It likely pertains to the* **Seven Scrolls of Wisdom***.)*\n\nThe authorship of the preceding three passages remains unclear.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Supreme Numinous for Dispelling Demons*, Scroll One, further states: Frequently press and massage the ears on both sides, also without count, to sharpen hearing. This is called \"tending the city walls,\" and its name is recorded in the imperial register.\n\nIt also says: Press the sides of the nose repeatedly to balance the breath.\n\nThe so-called \"irrigating the Central Marchmount\" is recorded in the imperial bamboo register. These two methods were transmitted and practiced by Lady Li of the Illustrious Terrace of the Square Zhang, Zhaoling.\n\n*(This is also referred to in the* **Scripture of the Supreme Numinous for Dispelling Demons, Scroll One**, *and should likewise belong to the preceding category.)*\n\nThe *Scripture of the Divine Flow and Flourishing Hair from the Supreme Bamboo Register* prescribes the method of anointing: At the time when living qi arises, swallow saliva twice seven times. Upon completion, press the painful area of the body and pray facing the king, saying:\n\n*\"Left Mystery, Right Mystery,\nThe Three Spirits unite in perfection.\nLeft Yellow, Right Yellow,\nThe Six Flowers align in harmony.\nWind qi and malignant epidemics\nHide in the four directions.\nJade liquid flows with grace,\nAbove and below, all is unobstructed.\nWithin, water and fire are dispatched;\nWithout, inauspiciousness is repelled.\nTo attain long life and ascend as an immortal,\nThe body remains ever strong.\"*\n\nAfterward, swallow saliva again twice seven times. By practicing this regularly, one will be free from illness. One should also press the painful area twenty-one times in haste.\n\nThis method was transmitted by Lady Wang of Right Radiance of the Cloudy Forest Palace of Canglang.\n\n*(The* **Scripture of the Divine Flow** *from the bamboo register has also not been revealed to the world and is not among the Three Grades.)*\n\nThe *Scripture of the Three and Five in Sequential Flow, Written in Vermilion* states: When seated, one should often close the eyes and inwardly visualize, contemplating the five viscera and the intestines and stomach. With prolonged practice, one will naturally perceive them with clarity and precision.\n\n*(These scriptures are among the true catalog of this canon.)* The *Scripture of Vermilion Characters on Stone and Light* states: One should often cover the mouth and nose with the hands, gently closing the eyes. After a long while, saliva will form in the palms. Then, use it to rub the face and eyes. Practicing this regularly will make the body fragrant.\n\n*(This scripture is not among the Three Grades.)* The *Purple Radiance Inner Vision Central Method* says: One should often lie down with eyes closed, settling the body and softly regulating the breath, appearing as if asleep so that others nearby do not notice. Then, inwardly visualize and listen attentively to the four directions, directing one’s ears and eyes to focus beyond ten thousand *li*. With prolonged practice, one will naturally perceive events beyond ten thousand *li*. If one cultivates this with concentrated intention, one may even see beyond a million *li*. Moreover, the ears will constantly hear the sounds of gold and jade, as well as the music of silk and bamboo. This is a wondrous method. The \"four directions\" is a general term—one should begin by focusing on a single direction, inwardly directing vision and hearing. At first, there may be no sign of success, but with persistent sincerity, one will naturally enter the subtle realm.\n\n*(This scripture is among the lower true catalog.)* The *Three Celestial Pass Scriptures of the Most High* state:\n\nKeep the eyes gently pressed near the inner corners with the hands, closing them as one does so. When the passage feels unobstructed, pause. Exhale, then begin anew. With constant practice, the eyes will attain penetrating vision.\n\n*(This scripture is among the lower true catalog. The \"Three Celestial Passes\" 〈Illustrations〉—the character \"Illustrations\" is suspected to be missing.)* The four precepts above are those commanded by the Mysterious Master.\n\n*(The Mysterious Master is the Southern Perfected Lady. These four scriptures have not yet been revealed to the world.)* The *Scripture of Treasured Spirits Spoken by the Pure Numinous Perfected*.\n\n*(The copy transcribed by the Prefectural Secretary bears this title. This refers only to the heading of the preceding matter. What follows consists of miscellaneous sayings by various perfected beings, with discrepancies in the order of titles—following the example of the* Zhen'gao*. Modern scholars all refer to it separately as the* Scripture of Treasured Spirits*. How could the* Scripture of Treasured Spirits *be a lesser teaching? This is merely a fragmentary transcription.)*\n\nNow, to focus the mind on the Dao and the true, to inwardly visualize the numinous person—even in profound obscurity, one’s intent is fully observed. If external obstacles remain unremoved, and one merely recites while retaining distractions, one will truly be unable to reverse the years of the western elm or restore the youth of the Mysterious Lad. Yet if one delights deeply in the mysterious and is steadfast in purpose, then even if teeth are carved and the face wrinkled, or white blossoms sprout upon the crown, the Dao can transform one into an infant in but a moment. It depends solely on the strength of one’s resolve. Age is no barrier to learning. I once was such a person.\n\n*(These matters are all being explained to instruct the Prefectural Secretary.)*\n\nTo seek the Dao, one must first clarify the eyes and sharpen the ears—these are the masters of all affairs. Moreover, the ears and eyes serve as the ladder for pursuing the true and the gateway for gathering the numinous. Success or failure hinges upon them, and survival or perishing depends on their {discernment}. Now, this direct method is shown here for practical use. (This refers to the essential techniques within the *Baoshen Jing*, hence called the \"direct method.\")\n\nThe Dao teaches: Regularly press with the hands the small cavities behind both eyebrows thirty-nine times. Then, with the palms and fingers, rub the upper parts of both eyes. Rotate the ears with the hands thirty times. The key lies in the number of repetitions, not the timing. Upon completion, reverse-stroke the forehead thirty-nine times, beginning from the space between the eyebrows and moving upward into the hairline, passing by the corners of the mouth. Swallow saliva as much as one wishes, without limit.\n\nBy practicing this consistently, the eyes will naturally become clear and bright. Within a year, one may read at night. This may also be done discreetly in the presence of others, without revealing its form. The small cavities behind the eyebrows are the palace of the Upper Prime Sixfold Union, governing the generation of eye radiance and the harmonious refinement of essence and light.\n\nThe Long Pearl penetrates the youthful, preserving and refining the eye spirits. This is the supreme Dao of the True Person’s sitting and rising, also named the *True Person’s Perpetual Internal Classic*. A true saying states: \"If you wish to read at night, you must cultivate the Perpetual Abode.\"\n\nThe reason the True Person can observe all four directions and make the Eight Radiant Clouds shine brightly is truly due to the clarity of the Perpetual Abode’s methods. The region beneath the eyes and above the cheekbones is the Chamber of Preserving Clarity, the归婴至道 (the Perfect Dao of Returning to Infancy). Rotating the ears with the hands is the technique for gathering luminous reflection. Rotation thereby unblocks the principles, disperses the blood, and prevents the onset of wrinkles. The eyes’ brilliance shines darkly, and the harmonious spirit is full.\n\nWhen a person is about to age, it rarely does not begin with the ears and eyes. Moreover, the signs of an aging form also first appear at the sides of the eyes. Stroking upward on the forehead while inwardly visualizing the Red Child and the twin luminaries of sun and moon, with the Upper Prime rejoicing—beginning from the space between the eyebrows for thirty-nine repetitions, ceasing only upon completion—this is called the Dao of the hands paying homage to the Three Primes, fortifying the brain and strengthening the hair.\n\nCover the four sides of the head with both hands, smoothing the hair into place, and do this as much as possible. Thereby, the blood in the head flows and disperses, and wind-dampness does not congeal. When all is complete...\n\nGently press the four corners of the eyes with the hands thirty-eight times, until one perceives light with clarity—this is the Dao of refining the spirit of the eyes. With long practice, one may behold the hundred spirits.\n\n(All practices of this Dao and the various miscellaneous methods in this scroll follow strict regulations, which are fully expounded in the *Dengzhen Yinjue*. They cannot be exhaustively annotated here.)\n\nDiligently cultivate this, ensuring the hands never leave the face, and one may attain the rank of Perfected Person without fail. Those who wish to practice this Dao must first swear an oath upon gold. The quantity of gold is determined by the sincerity of the practitioner—it is not merely a formality to be performed carelessly.\n\nThe Perfected Officials say: \"To inquire about daily conduct, one must pledge with a golden covenant.\" This means it is not to be transmitted to the unworthy. This Dao originates from the *Taishang Baoshen Jing*, a scripture that was not initially disseminated in the world. Those destined to become Perfected Persons in the future may occasionally obtain it. The essentials of refining and returning to purity are all contained herein.\n\n(Once the oath is firmly established, there are no further requirements, though it is fitting to present two pairs of golden rings when receiving this teaching.)\n\nThe Lady of the Purple Tenuity issues this instruction as follows.\n\n*(The Lady of the Purple Tenuity, having heard Master Pei’s discourse on the* Baoshen Jing*, continues to expound upon the matters of the Treasure Spirit in this manner—thus, what Master Pei has spoken aligns with this very evening’s teaching.)*\n\nUpon awakening from sleep at night, one should first knock the teeth together nine times, then swallow saliva nine times. Once done, press the hands along the sides of the nose, moving up and down dozens of times. Softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"The Supreme Four Luminaries,\nThe Nine Gates emit essence.\nEars and eyes profoundly clear,\nCommuning with the real, reaching the numinous.\nThe Mystic Terrace in Heaven’s midst,\nFlowing harmony, balance restored.\nThe Proud Maiden’s cloud-like grace,\nThe eye-child’s radiant brightness.\nFlowering wisdom, resplendent clarity,\nA hundred measures subtly pure.\nPreserve harmony in the Upper Prime,\nWandering the Nine Citadels.\nThe Five Viscera take root,\nEars and eyes naturally arise.\nThe Heavenly Terrace, lush and serene,\nPillars and beams stand firm.\nThe Seven Po refine and temper,\nThe Three Hun rest in peace.\nThe Red Child bears the light,\nEver at my side.\nShould any dare obstruct my ears and eyes,\nThe Supreme shall shatter them with the Flowing Bells.\nTen thousand evils vanish,\nEvery wish fulfilled.\nSun and moon guard the gates,\nThe heart treasury holds the Five Stars.\nInvoked by the Perfected Sovereign,\nAll echoes heed with reverence.\"*\n\nUpon awakening, perform this pressing and invocation without fail, not missing a single night’s rest. Though the true Dao may be attained, those like us still practice it constantly. When no longer lying down, one may perform it while seated. This is the supreme incantation of the *Taishang Baoshen Jing*, a Way that sharpens the ears and brightens the eyes, strengthening memory and fostering luminous clarity.\n\nThe breath in the nose is balanced and even,\nNo drooping snivel flows.\nThe four echoes resound, the eight permeate,\nThe face bears the glow of youth.\nMastering the hun and recording the po,\nRepelling a thousand demons.\nThe seven apertures divide the flow,\nTheir hue like pristine blossoms.\nThis is the wondrous Way of the Perfected One’s rising and resting.\nThe reason it is called \"rising and resting\" is that it is constantly practiced.\n\nThereafter, swallow the saliva nine times,\nRub and wipe the face and eyes,\nInducing a slight warmth as the norm.\nDo this whenever the occasion arises.\n\nIn the third year of the Xingning reign, the year *yichou*, on the twenty-third day of the sixth month, at night, this was transcribed.\nThat very evening, among those who practiced the Dao, many suffered from dullness of ears and eyes. Desiring to request this method, that very night a revelation descended, and it was still seen to be so.\n\n*(This is Yang Jun’s personal account. The Prefect was past sixty, his ears and eyes beginning to fail, thus he inquired. Yang, unwilling to name him directly, attributed it to \"those among us.\")*\nHe further warned: \"Daoists whose hearing is impaired have practiced the Yellow and Red without moderation. One must be cautious.\"\n\n*(This likely serves as a warning to the Prefect.)*\n\nThe above is a passage of pure numinous instruction:\nComb the hair and arrange it,\nDoing so many times over,\nTo circulate the blood and qi.\n\nScattering wind and dampness.\nFrequent combing—alternate their use.\nThere is no need to loosen the hair.\n\nThe above is a discourse of Lady Ziwei.\n\nThe *Taiyi Lüjing* states: When arranging the hair, face the direction of the kingly earth. At the very beginning of combing, silently recite:\n\"Mud-pellet’s mysterious blossom,\nPreserve essence, let it long endure.\nLeft is the hidden moon,\nRight is the root of the sun.\nSix Harmonies refine and purify,\nA hundred spirits receive grace.\"\nUpon finishing the recitation, swallow saliva thrice. If practiced constantly, the hair will not fall but instead grow daily. Frequently change combs, combing often but without causing pain. One may also have an attendant comb the hair thoroughly. Thus, blood and fluids will not stagnate, and the roots of the hair will remain firm.\n\nThe above was taught by An Jiuhua for practical use.\n*(These two passages concern halting graying and preventing hair loss, and were also given in answer to the Prefect.)*\n\nLady Ziwei further instructed:\n\"Beneath the canopy of blossoming splendor, extend harmony to the celestial perfected.\nEnter the valley of mountain streams, fill the source of the celestial mountain.\nThen the numinous and ethereal become visible, and the myriad ghosts destroy themselves.\nThis is what is meant by ‘looking up to harmonize with the celestial perfected, looking down to press the mountain source.’\"\n*(The blossoming canopy is also called the blossoming court.)*\n\nThe celestial perfected is between the two eyebrows, at the corners of the brows. The mountain source is the base of the philtrum beneath the nose, slightly recessed into the valley. The blossoming court lies below the two eyebrows—it is the thoroughfare of penetrating vision. The celestial perfected is the upper chamber for drawing in the numinous. At dawn, noon, and dusk, constantly swallow saliva twenty-seven times, and urgently press with the fingers twenty-seven times in the yin manner as a regular practice. This will enable one to attain numinous clarity of vision and block the path of the myriad evils. Perform this thrice daily.\n*(Lady Ziwei said: When a person suddenly falls ill and is near death, worldly physicians only know to needle the philtrum, unaware of needling the valley of the mountain source—this is a grave error. The original annotation begins here, as Yang appended it to the Prefect’s letter.)*\n\nPress while reciting:\n\"Open and clear the celestial court,\nLet me attain long life.\nPenetrate vision for ten thousand miles,\nLet soul and spirit return to infancy.\nDestroy ghosts and repel demons,\nSummon a thousand numinous beings.\nAscend to the Supreme,\nMerge with the sun.\nObtain the rank of perfected person,\nInscribed in the register of the mysterious.\n[As in the time of Duke Zhuang of Chu.]\"\n\n(This refers to King Zhuang of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period.) Market chief Song Laizi constantly swept the entire marketplace. After a long time, a beggar appeared, wandering the market to beg for food day after day. He would often chant:\n\n*\"The celestial court blooms with twin flowers,\nThe mountain source reveals yin’s evil.\nAt dawn, press the heavenly steed,\nCome to the abode of the Supreme Perfected.\nThe perfected person cannot hide,\nThus vanquishing the hundred demons.\"*\n\nSong Laizi chanted this while begging, yet none in the market understood his song. Only Laizi suddenly realized the beggar might be an immortal, though he still did not grasp the meaning of the verses. He then became the beggar’s disciple, abandoning his post to follow him. After thirteen years, the beggar transmitted to him the Dao of the Middle Immortals. Laizi now resides on Central Marchmount.\n\nThe beggar was Feng Yanshou, a Perfected One of Western Marchmount and a court historian during the reign of King Xuan of Zhou. The \"heavenly steed\" refers to the hands, and the \"mountain source\" to the area beneath the nose. Written on the night of the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month. *(Yang Jie concludes his transcription here.)*\n\nLady Yunlin Wang said: The Dao of the immortals and perfected ones takes the ears and eyes as its foundation. Excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures dims the eyes, while excessive sorrow blocks the ears. These two afflictions arise from within and rush outward—there are no others. Now, this method makes one’s hearing and vision increasingly sharp and clear.\n\nOnly those who fail to practice it find the practice difficult. To achieve supreme clarity and luminous perception, and to observe spirits and deities at will, one must purify the heart and sever all distracting thoughts, abandoning dissipation and excess. This is called \"strictness at the outset.\"\n\nAt night before sleep, first tightly close the eyes and face east. With the base of each thumb, press and wipe from the eyes toward the ears, so that both palms meet at the nape of the neck—perform this twenty-seven times. Visualize three colored qi—purple, azure, and crimson—emerging before the eyes. This is the inner pressing of the Three Primordial Clouds, which irrigates and unites the Celestial Lads.\n\nRecite the following incantation in silence:\n*\"Celestial Lads of the Three Clouds,\nTrue Lords of the Two Eyes,\nRadiant and luminous, you infuse essence,\nOpening and clearing the spirit.\nGreat Mystery’s cloudy forms,\nSpiritual steeds soaring lightly—\nGuard and benefit the twin gates,\nUnseal and penetrate the nine portals.\nA hundred joints respond in resonance,\nMorning fluid ascends to the Mud-Pill Palace.\nThe body ascends to the Jade Court,\nRanked among the Supreme Perfected.\"*\n\nThese forty-eight characters recited, swallow saliva fifty times, then open the eyes. This may be practiced as a regular routine, whether sitting or rising, not limited to night. If performed at the hour of birth for about a year, the ears and eyes will grow keen and bright. With prolonged practice, one may see clearly for a thousand miles, perceive spirits and deities, and hear sounds beyond ordinary reach. This is indeed a lofty Dao of the true immortals—not merely for brightening the eyes and opening the ears.\n\nThose who aspire to study the Dao should strive to keep their practices and perceptions unknown to others in all matters. As the song in the Supreme Palace of the Most High declares:\n*\"Hands grasp the qi of the Eight Clouds,\nRadiance guards the Two Lads.\nThe Supreme Perfected holds the bright mirror,\nIts reflection unites the edge of sun and moon.\nCloudy forms brush the high gates,\nOpening the Mud-Pill Palace.\nTen thousand sounds enter a hundred passages,\nThe Proud Maiden sits in the Dark Chamber.\nThe more one practices, the more vibrant and flourishing—\nThe numinous power naturally flows through.\"*\n\nThis song speaks precisely of the canon of ears and eyes. We, the immortals of Canglang Fangzhang, have always treasured and practiced it. This Way emerges from the *Four Illuminations Jade Canon of the Supreme*. It is transmitted only after swearing an oath upon blue-gold. Thereafter may it be practiced.\n\n*(The above was all received by the Lady of Right Florescence, who instructed the Chief Scribe accordingly. Additionally, pledges of faith were employed, along with blue silk. It is also fitting to establish standards in accordance: twenty feet of blue cloth and two pairs of gold rings. These are the three original sections of the* Four Illuminations Jade Canon.*)*\n\nClose the gates and bow in stillness—then the hundred ghosts will stand in awe. The Merit Officers may then be seen and spoken with, for this comes only through long practice.\n\nOn the second day of the seventh month, the Lady of South Marchmount instructed: When burning incense, do not look back, lest you offend the Perfected and summon demonic responses. When entering the chamber of stillness, first send someone ahead to announce your presence to those above. When approaching a meal, do not speak of matters of death. When bathing, constantly visualize the Six Dings, and your wishes will be fulfilled in all directions. When combing your hair, face the direction of the King’s land. At the first stroke of the comb, softly recite this incantation:\n*\"Mysterious flower of the Mud-Pill,\nPreserve essence and prolong existence.\nTo the right, the hidden moon;\nTo the left, the root of the sun.\nThe Six Harmonies refine and purify,\nThe hundred spirits receive grace.\"*\nUpon finishing the recitation, swallow saliva three times.\n\n*(This passage is identical to that spoken by the Consort An, though the order of precedence is unclear. Judging by the reckoning of sun and moon, this appears to be the later version.)*\n\nThe above four instructions were given by the Lady of South Marchmount.\n\nThe *Orthodox Unity Canon of Leveling* states: Close the breath and bow in stillness, so that the hundred ghosts stand in awe. The Merit Officer Messengers, the Dragon-Tiger Lords, may then be seen and spoken with—this comes only through sincere and long practice.\n\n*(The Orthodox Unity tradition possesses the* Orthodox Unity of Leveling. *Here, all matters concerning bowing in stillness are recorded. It must belong to the Orthodox Unity Canon, though some characters may be missing.)*\n\nIt further states: When burning incense, do not look back. To look back offends the Perfected and summons demonic responses. It also states...\n\nEntering the chamber of stillness: first step forward with the right foot, then bring the left foot forward to align with the right. Only then proceed as usual. This allows one’s petition to be presented and heard above.\n\nIt further states: When partaking of food, do not speak of matters of death. Do not expose food, lest it attract a host of malevolent spirits.\n\nIt further states: Bathe frequently. On every *jiazi* day, one should wash one’s hair; if not, then at least on the first day of each month. This enables communion with the numinous. Bathing is not to be feared for its frequency—what is to be feared is one’s own inability. By washing away the stench of the corpse, the Perfected may enter.\n\nThe above six instructions were commanded by the Dark Mystery Master for practice and application. *(The preceding six clauses largely resemble those mentioned earlier, being a summary of received teachings. Here, they are recorded in greater detail, with two additional clauses appended for the Chief Scribe’s reference.)*\n\nThe above ten clauses were transcribed by the Chief Scribe.\n\nWhen ingesting immortal elixirs, always face the direction of one’s natal destiny. After ingestion, do not speak of death, mourning, or inauspicious matters, lest it harm the embryo and injure the spirit, rendering the elixir useless.\n\nThe Lord of Life of the Eastern Minister. *(This clause originally followed the transmission of the* Mysterious Perfection of the Luminous Hall *method.)*\n\nThe above clause was written by Yang.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Nine Transformations and Ten Transmutations for Renewal* of the Most High states: If one treads upon filth or any impure place, one should bathe and perform the *Dissolution of Form* to purge it. The method employs ten *liang* of bamboo leaves and four *liang* of peeled peach bark, boiled in one *hu* and two *dou* of pure water until it reaches a single boil. Adjust the temperature and bathe the body, and all filth will be dispelled. This not only removes impurity but also prevents damp impediment, sores, and itching. Bamboo is hollow, plain, and internally white, while peach repels evil and breaks filth—thus these two substances are used to purge the turbidity within the body. When celestial beings descend to wander the earth and return, they invariably use this water to cleanse themselves. Even the talismanic waters and incantations of the mundane world—mere minor arts of external alchemy—cannot compare to this formula. If one bathes, it is even better, though this water is not used for washing the hair. The pure essence for refining the corpse is precisely for bathing—truly wondrous and arcane.\n\nThe above was commanded for use by the Lady of Purple Tenuity.\n\nThe above clause was transcribed by the Chief Scribe.\n\nThose who receive the esoteric instructions and practice the concealed scriptures of the Great Elixir, preserving them within the Three Primordials’ Grotto-Chambers, shall each month pay homage to the Three Primordial Lords of Grand Simplicity. On the ninth day of the first month, the eighth day of the second month, the seventh day of the third month, the sixth day of the fourth month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the fourth day of the sixth month, the third day of the seventh month, the second day of the eighth month, the first day of the ninth month, the tenth day of the tenth month, the eleventh day of the eleventh month, and the twelfth day of the twelfth month at night, within a chamber of still repose, they shall face north. Having performed six bows twice over, they shall kneel, press their foreheads to the ground, and say:\n\n“Reverently I address the Supreme Great Dao, the Lofty Void, the Jade Dawn, the Grand Simplicity, the Purple Palace, the Eight Numinous Ones, and the Three Primordial Lords; the Central Yellow Elder, the Peerless White Prime, the Supreme Emperor; the Five Elders, the High Perfected, the Upper Immortals, the Three Sovereigns of the Grand Culmen’s Imperial Essence. I, your disciple of the Great Grotto’s Three Luminaries, on this auspicious night, when the Celestial Pass opens ninefold, do ascend my petition to the Jade Emperor, the True Lord on High, beseeching to attain longevity in the world above, to live for boundless eons, to ride at the hour the yellow dawn’s green canopy and dragon-carriage ascend to the Purple Court, and to command the myriad spirits.”\n\nAt the Four Brightnesses, the attendants stand guard.\nThis is completed. Let no one know of it. (This entry is transcribed by the clerk.)\n\nTo the right: The Rites of the Four Dawns for the Grand Simplicity and the Three Primordial Lords.\nOn an auspicious day at midnight, the Supreme Great Dao and the Jade Dawn Lord customarily ascend on the fourth day of the first month, the eighth day of the second month, the fifteenth day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, the ninth day of the fifth month, the sixth day of the sixth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the eighth day of the eighth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifth day of the tenth month, the third day of the eleventh month, and the twelfth day of the twelfth month to the Jade Firmament’s Jasper Chamber, casting their gaze upon the world to seek those of steadfast resolve and far-wandering hearts. On these days, at dawn when the sun rises, face north and bow twice. This may also be done in seclusion. Declare your innermost aspirations and desires. When finished, swallow saliva thirty-six times. (Transcribed by the Chief Scribe.)\n\nThe Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea customarily ascends on *dingmao* days to the Square Cauldron’s Eastern Florescence Terrace, gazing in the four directions. On such days, you may face the sun and bow twice at sunrise, thereby absorbing the sun’s essence. (Again transcribed by the clerk.)\n\nTo the right: Issued by the Purple Void Primordial Lord.\n(These three matters pertain to the methods of the Hidden Dawn Audience for advanced disciples. Their scriptures are not revealed to the world, thus the Southern Perfected has brought them forth. They are also to be followed and practiced by the Chief Scribe.)\n\nThese three entries were transcribed together by the Chief Scribe and the clerk on a single sheet.\nCustomarily observe the second day of the second month, the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the eighth month, and the ninth day of the ninth month.\n\nOn the night of the tenth day of the tenth month, perform the visualization practices of the Cavern Secrets within your bedchamber. It is auspicious to remain alone and sleepless. That evening, the Guardian Scriptures Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, along with the Supreme Ultimate Masters of the Celestial Prohibitions, will descend from the void to observe you. On this night, burn incense with utmost devotion, as though awaiting their arrival. Whether sitting or lying down, engage in visualization, scripture recitation, or contemplation of the Real—whatever your intent directs. However, you must not attend to other matters that evening, for this is not the Way of seeking the Dao. If you maintain vigilance on this day, all the more will goodness accrue. At the outset of receiving the Cavern Secrets, you should consistently cultivate this practice, holding it firmly in mind.\n\nShould you encounter ill dreams, they may arise from three causes: first, the mischief of the *po* souls; second, the testing of the heart; third, the predations of the corpse-demons. To dispel them, upon awakening, press the philtrum with your left hand thirty-four times, and gnash your teeth thirty-four times. Then softly intone:\n\n*\"Great Cavern of the True and Mysterious,\nRefine and forge the Three Hun Souls:\nThe First Hun swiftly guards the Seven Po,\nThe Second Hun swiftly guards the Mud-Pill Palace,\nThe Third Hun receives the heart’s command.\nSwiftly invoke the Supreme Lords of the Three Origins.\nI have encountered an inauspicious dream—\nThe Seven Po and the wandering corpse\nHave conspired with the source of myriad evils.\nHasten to summon Peach-Kang, Guardian of Life,\nTo report above to the Imperial Lord.\nThe Five Elders and Nine Perfected\nAll stand guard at the gates of the body.\nThe Yellow Chamber’s Divine Masters,\nThe Purple Gate Generals,\nWielding halberds and shaking bells,\nDispel and extinguish the malign influences.\nTurn misfortune to fortune,\nSevering all ties to life and death.\"*\n\nConclude. If you lie down again, you will assuredly receive an auspicious response. As for the baleful *qi* of ill dreams, it will be sealed beneath the Three Passes. After three years, only spiritually resonant dreams will manifest, and all dreams will become clear reflections of future events, utterly free from inauspicious omens or ill portents.\n\n*(The character for \"evil\" [恶] as written by the Chief Scribe places* xin *beneath* you*. Its meaning is akin to* xin *beneath* xi*, signifying the harsh and malevolent heart of Metal in the West.)*\n\nIf you encounter an auspicious dream in the night—a good dream that your heart deems favorable—this is a sign of blessed resonance. Upon awakening, rub your eyes thirty-four times and gnash your teeth thirty-four times. Then softly intone:\n\n*\"Supreme High Essence,\nThree Emperors of Cinnabar Spirit,\nThe Crimson Palace shines with clarity,\nBlessed resonance conveys its message.\nThe Three Origins’ gentle *po* souls,\nThe Heavenly Sovereign bestows the scriptures.\nAll endeavors harmonize,\nAscending as flying immortals to the Upper Clarity,\nEver in the company of Jade Perfected,\nTogether assembling in the Purple Court.\"*\n\nConclude. These are the secret formulas of the Great Cavern, transmitted to those who first cross its currents.\n\n*(These three matters also pertain to the affairs of the Cavern Chamber and Great Cinnabar school. The true scriptures have not yet been revealed to the world. The texts circulating in the present age merely touch upon these matters, with many additions and omissions.)*\n\nThese three entries were transcribed by the Chief Scribe.\n\n*(This talisman was drawn by the Chief Scribe.)*\n*(This talisman was drawn by the clerk.)*\n\nThe talismans above were originally drawn in vermilion. The *Inner Scripture of the Hall of Light*’s talisman for \"Opening the Heart and Dispelling Delusion\" was composed and employed by Perfected Lord Wang. It is to be activated at dawn on an auspicious day.\n\nHaving received the vermilion script from Lord Wang, bow twice in reverence. The prayer states:\n\n\"May the Five Spirits open the heart,\npierce hearing to silence all sound.\nMay the Three Hun gather essence,\nsteadfastly guard the cinnabar heart.\nLet me be free from delusion,\nthe Five Viscera roam afar.\"\n\nAfter bowing, conclude the prayer. Once the prayer is finished, ingest the talisman. Upon ingestion, swallow saliva five times and click the teeth five times. Perform this in secrecy, unseen by others. *(The two instances of \"delusion\" should both read as \"forgetting.\")*\n\nIf not performed on an opening day, take it on the first, fifteenth, or twenty-seventh day of the month—three times monthly. Within a year, the secret art will manifest its efficacy.\n\n*(The talisman and these three entries were transcribed in duplicate by the Chief Scribe and clerk, with the clerk writing in vermilion.)*\n\nThe Controller of Destinies of the Eastern Minister states:\n\nFormerly, Master Wang was granted the *Supreme Scripture of the Hall of Light and Mysterious Perfection* by the Most High. After purifying through fasting and abstaining from grains, visualize the sun and moon within the mouth: by day, the sun; by night, the moon. Let them grow as large as rings—the sun crimson with nine rays of purple light, the moon yellow with ten rays of white light. Visualize swallowing the luminous essence of their rays, practicing this in secrecy without count.\n\nWhen not engaged in this visualization, let the sun and moon return to reside within the Hall of Light of the face: the sun on the left, the moon on the right. Let the two luminaries merge and communicate with the pupils of the eyes.\n\nThis Dao gathers and circulates generative essence, harmonizes the hun and spirit. The Six Ding spirits attend, and heavenly soldiers guard. This is the supreme Dao of the Perfected.\n\nThe *Scripture of Mysterious Perfection* of the Most High requires first swearing an oath before practice. Only after its observance may one hear the Dao of jade pendants and golden *yu-dang*.\n\nFormerly, Ji Wei maintained a strict fast for three years, his sincerity unwavering in solitary devotion, until at last he attained it.\n\nThus the divine radiance illumines the body, and only then may one receive the scripture. This is the Dao of Mysterious Perfection—essential yet unburdensome. I have long treasured and concealed it, keeping it close at hand. Therefore, I reveal it only to those who are discreet and vigilant.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Mysterious Perfection of the Hall of Light* exists, though its text is brief. Its core lies in oral transmission, and one should practice precisely as instructed. Formerly, I, Wei, did not possess the scripture but followed this method alone—only then did I obtain it. If you wish to receive it, you may seek it from me. The *Hidden Scripture of Jade Pendants* is not something I have seen.\n\nWhen traveling at night or lying in darkness, if fear arises in the heart, visualize the sun and moon returning to the Hall of Light. In an instant, the hundred evils will vanish of themselves. For those dwelling in the mountains, this is most excellent.\n\n*(The above explains the method of visualization for the* Scripture of Mysterious Perfection. *Its greater scripture is contained in the Mao transmission.)*\n\nThe three passages above were transcribed by Yang. The inner method of the Most Void Perfected, the Red Lord of South Mountain, states: On the fifth night of the month, at midnight, visualize the image of the sun within the heart, entering through the mouth. Let it illuminate the interior of the heart, merging its light with that of the sun. When this is complete, you should feel warmth in the heart, with rosy radiance as verification. After a long while, recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Great brightness nurtures essence,\nWithin, the cinnabar heart is refined.\nLights merge and illumine,\nDivine perfected ones come seeking.\"*\n\nWhen finished...\n\nSwallow the saliva nine times. On the fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days of the month, repeat the above practice. This will render one’s perception bright and keen, all senses clear and penetrating. The face will glow with jade-like radiance, the body with golden luster. After fifteen years of practice, the Great One will dispatch a jeweled chariot to receive you, ascending to the Supreme Empyrean. The practice should be frequent, not limited to these specific days.\n\nThe above passage is from the *Scripture of the Most High on Dispelling Demons*. (This scripture has not yet been revealed to the world. The above passage was transcribed by the Prefect.)\n\nThe method of the Eastern Florescence Perfected for absorbing the images of the sun and moon: men absorb the image of the sun, women the image of the moon. If practiced without fail each day, it sharpens perception, brightens clarity, and causes the five viscera to blossom. The hun and po souls are refined and tempered, the six bowels harmonized and at peace—this is the Dao of longevity and deathlessness. 〔 〕〔 〕. (These two characters are written in cinnabar in the original text as *moshou*.)\n\nThe above records the method of absorbing the images of the sun and moon. It may also be practiced by visualizing the sun in circular form. (The above passage was transcribed by Yang.)\n\nThe origins of these two methods are uncertain as to which Perfected One transmitted them. Emperor Ming of the Han dreamed of a divine being, nine feet six inches tall, with a halo of light encircling his neck.\n\nThe apparition soared before the palace hall, filling the Emperor with joy. He inquired throughout the court, and the learned scholar Fu Yi replied: \"Your servant has heard that in the land of Tianzhu there is one who has attained the Dao, known as the Buddha. I have heard he can fly through the air and his body emits a radiant light—this must be the divine being from your dream.\" The Emperor then understood. He dispatched envoys—Zhang Qian, the Feathered Forest Captain Qin Jing, Academician Wang Zun, and eleven others—to the Great Yuezhi Kingdom to procure and transcribe the *Forty-Two Chapters of the Buddha’s Sutra*, which were later stored in the fourteenth chamber of the Orchid Terrace’s stone repository. At once, he ordered a Buddhist temple built north of the road outside the western gate of Luoyang. He also commissioned a Buddha statue and a depiction of Hariti at the Cool Terrace of the Southern Palace. The Emperor was deeply moved, and even before constructing his own mausoleum, he had a Buddha image installed in the palace hall. At that time, the realm prospered and the people lived in peace; distant barbarians, admiring the transformation, willingly submitted as vassals. The arrival of Buddhist images in China thus began in the reign of Emperor Ming.\n\n*(This account roughly aligns with external records, though it appears Buddhism had already been present in Chang’an for some time—Pei Jun’s case being one such instance. Moreover, the Dharma originated in Tianzhu and Gandhāra, not the Yuezhi lands, which sets this account apart.)*\n\nNow, desiring to speak of the various minor *fangzhu* where the Buddha is revered, it is fitting first to recount these matters.\n\nAccording to records, the Zhang Qian mentioned here was not the one from the Former Han—perhaps only their names coincided. Fu Yi, styled Zhongwu, is attested in the *Book of Han*. The Qin princes Jing and Zun are obscure. This temple is called the White Horse Temple. Emperor Ming was later interred at the Mausoleum of Manifest Virtue; what is called here the \"Longevity Mausoleum\" refers to the practice of Han emperors, who, while still reigning, prepared their tombs in advance—much as people today construct their own burial mounds—rather than naming an actual mausoleum. External records also state that the court dispatched Attendant Gentleman Zhang Kan (or, as some say, Gentleman of the Palace Zhang [Xin]) to Tianzhu to copy and bring back scriptures and images, along with śramaṇas. Yet even this account may not reflect the true transmission, for it likely derives from the old notes of Master Yang. Nevertheless, in the authentic scriptures and pronouncements, references to Buddhist matters appear frequently.\n\nThe *fangzhu* are aligned with the four directions, hence their name. Each face measures one thousand three hundred *li*, and the four faces together span five thousand two hundred *li*. Its height reaches nine thousand *zhang*. There stands the Ever-Bright Mount Tai, and the Moonlit Mound, each encircling four hundred *li*. The minor mountains and rivers resemble those of our world, yet their grasses and trees flourish more luxuriantly, and their blossoms and fruits are more resplendent. The herb of immortality abounds, as do springs of sweet water; those who partake of them do not die.\n\nThe Palace of the Azure Lord is situated atop the Eastern Florescence Mountain, covering two hundred *li* in extent—entirely the abode of celestial immortals and highest perfected beings. Its halls and chambers are wrought of gold, jade, and luminous jasper. There is also the Dark and Frigid Mountain, upon which stands a separate outer palace, its structures spanning two hundred *li*. To the east and west of the great *fangzhu* lie smaller *fangzhu*, each three thousand *li* distant. These minor *fangzhu* also measure three hundred *li* on each side, encircling one thousand two hundred *li*, and each possesses its own Palace of the Azure Lord.\n\nMoreover, they teem with middle-ranking immortals, numinous birds, and sacred beasts. The great *fangzhu* lies opposite the southeast of Kuaiji, yet from the shore of Kuaiji it appears seventy thousand *li* away. Gazing northeast, one sees the Scalding Vale and the Land of the Fusang Tree, which are another sixty thousand *li* distant from the *fangzhu*. (The *fangzhu* is the *yi* region, the Scalding Vale the *jia* region; thus from *yin* to *chen* spans ten thousand *li*. The five corners and seven directions are spoken of in terms of diagonal angles, totaling fourteen thousand *li*—hence the seventy thousand *li* from Kuaiji.)\n\nTo the west of the great *fangzhu*, atop the minor *fangzhu*, many follow the Dao of the Buddha.\n\nAmidst these lands stand pagodas, intricately carved from gold and jade. Some rise a hundred *zhang* in height, their towers numbering in the dozens. Those who dwell above are all filial and deathless, for they partake of the deathless herb. They ingest the essence of the Five Stars and study the *Xia Gui Zang Jing*, employing its methods to traverse the skies. (Note: The *Xia* canon is called *Lian Shan*, the *Yin* canon *Gui Zang*—this differs from the present text. Though they follow the Buddha’s Way, they do not adopt the form or robes of *bhikṣus*. The world calls them the true household of bodhisattvas.)\n\nTo the east of the great *fangzhu*, atop the minor *fangzhu*, lie many rare and numinous treasures. There is white jade wine infused with golden nectar, and the Azure Lord stores celestial treasures here in abundance. Many immortals also dwell here, partaking of the deathless herb and drinking this wine. Their bodies take on the luster of gold and jade. They often play the Nine Numinous Flutes for their own delight. The sound of the flute carries forty *li*, its thirty holes carved into bamboo two or three *chi* long. When the nine flutes play in unison, the hundred beasts dance, and dozens of phoenixes arrive to harmonize with the melody.\n\nThe Palace of the Great *Fangzhu* is the Azure Lord’s constant abode. Those who dwell above are celestial perfected ones and lofty immortals, where the lords of the Grand Ultimate, the ducal ministers, and the various Directors of Destinies reside. Some practice the method of ingesting the rays of the sun and moon. Though they have already attained the Dao and become perfected, they continue this practice. (Mount Huo and Red City are also bureaus of the Directors of Destinies. Only the Grand Prime Perfected, the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, resides there. Li Zhongfu is in the West, Han Zhong in the South, and the remaining thirty-one Directors of Destinies are all in the Eastern Flower Capital. The Azure Lad serves as the Grand Director of Destinies, overseeing all. Master Yang also states: the Eastern Dipper’s attendant—it is unclear which rank he holds.)\n\nDirect your attention inward and visualize a symbol within the heart, as large as a coin, glowing red. Then visualize the sun with nine rays rising from the heart, ascending through the throat to the teeth, where the rays linger before returning to the stomach. After a long while, with eyes closed, clearly perceive the heart and stomach, then exhale and rinse the mouth with saliva thirty-nine times before stopping. Perform this thrice daily. After a year of practice, illnesses will vanish. After five years, the body will radiate light. After eighteen years, one will surely attain the Dao, casting no shadow at noon, repelling a hundred ghosts and a thousand malign influences. Constantly visualize the sun within the heart and the moon within the Mud Pill Palace. At night, ingest the moon’s essence as you do the sun’s. Visualize the moon’s ten white rays descending from the brain into the throat, where the rays do not pass the teeth but return to the stomach.\n\nThis is the method of the perfected ones of *Fangzhu*, recorded in the *Sutra of Great Wisdom*, upper and middle chapters. Those who practice it steadfastly will witness the Great Peace. (This likely corresponds to the seventh section of the *Seven Chapters of Wisdom for Dispelling Demons*.)\n\nThe above was imparted by the Lady of the Southern Culmen. Practicing the Way of the sun in the heart and the moon in the Mud Pill Palace is said to be simple and easily grasped. Those who persist without interruption will expel the Three Corpses from the body, cure a hundred illnesses and a thousand afflictions, and master the Way of refining the hun and restraining the po. When the sun and moon perpetually illuminate the body, ghosts will have no place to hide. The Azure Lord still practices this method. I am one such practitioner and now reveal it to you. You may discreetly share it with those of sincere intent.\n\nPracticing this Way does not hinder the methods of ingesting the sun and moon as prescribed in the precious scriptures; combining them is even better. Immortals accomplish a thousand tasks in a single day and night without feeling weary. How diligently they cultivate the Dao! Life must not be squandered.\n\n(The \"precious scriptures’ sun and moon\" refer to those used in the Purple Texts.)\n\nThe above was imparted by the Lord of Western City. (This was also told to Master Yang, who was instructed to share it with the various Xu.)\n\nTo pursue the Dao is like shooting an arrow: one must aim straight and not waver to hit the target. Enter the mountains with unwavering resolve, and you will attain the true Perfection.\n\nSo instructed the Mysterious Clarity. (Note: The two lofty perfected ones, Mysterious Clarity of the Southern Culmen and Western City, should not have further revelations. Only one precept and one poem each remain. It is unclear when this teaching was imparted.)\n\nThe above eight passages are from Yang’s writings. Practicing these four Ways, according to the superior methods of the Jade Mystery, will astonish the senses within a year. One may then diligently pursue them without doubt.\n\n(The Central Lord’s records on this matter lack the preceding pages, so the exact method is unknown.)\n\nSo says the Perfected One of the Grand Ultimate.\n\nReading the *Daodejing*’s five thousand characters ten thousand times will summon the cloud chariot to receive you. If after completing ten thousand recitations it has not yet arrived, read it twice a month. You must depart only when the cloud chariot comes.\n\nThe above two passages are from a certain master’s writings.\n\nShanshi Yuan received the method from Master Meng: at dusk, first recite the *Huangting Neijing* once before sleep, so that one’s hun and po may be naturally refined. Practicing this for twenty-one years will also lead to immortality—this is equivalent to ten thousand recitations. Reciting three or four times each evening is excellent.\n\nThe Lady of Northern Peak, Jiang, said: \"Reading this sutra also keeps one free from illness. It is the Way of not dying.\" (This [second] method of twenty-one years, one recitation per evening, does not amount to ten thousand recitations. Perhaps \"one\" should be \"seven\" or \"eight.\" Otherwise, two or three recitations per evening would suffice.)\n\nWhen visualizing the Five Stars, one must carefully follow the *Eight Purities*, beginning with the King Star. Visualize it at the time when generative qi arises. If the King Star does not appear first, do not visualize it first. As for observing the stars, one may do so freely within the chamber. Diligence and sincerity are paramount—it is not necessary to see all the stars clearly before swift communion is achieved. Observation should be precise.\n\nThe Lord of Pure Numinosity instructed: The essential method of visualization is to perceive the Five Stars with the eyes, each descending toward you upon its radiant beam. Then, following the descent of the King Star, visualize it. Swallow one beam, then proceed to the Star of Stability, visualizing it in turn. After a long while, swallow one beam from each of the Five Stars, drawing them all into the mouth and swallowing them, matching the number of the Star of Stability. (This is an alternate method not found in the sutras.)\n\nIf suddenly visualizing the Five Stars, follow the usual method without focusing on their descent. (By this account, the latter is a solitary cultivation method.)\n\nOn the first night of the sixth month, the Perfected One of Azure Numinosity spoke. (The above four passages are from Yang’s writings. \"Azure\" should be \"Pure.\")\n\nThe five celestial script characters of the Sun’s essence are: \"Sun’s soul, Pearl Radiance, Shining Veil, Green Reflection, Swirling Rosy Clouds, Crimson Youth, Mysterious Flame, Whirlwind Image.\" These sixteen characters comprise the Way of the Golden Watchtower’s Sage Lord, who gathers and ingests the flying root. Formerly received from the Celestial Emperor of the Great Tenuity, it is also called the *Sutra of Cinnabar Gold Essence, Stone Radiance, Water Mother, and Jade Embryo*.\n\nThe Right Florescence said:\n*\"Pearl rounds and gathers brilliance, the green veil congeals,*\n*The sun’s rosy clouds blaze bright, the crimson youth holds numen,*\n*Mysterious flame scatters light, the whirlwind’s image stirs the clear.\"*\nSuch is the Sun’s power, the might of its spirit.\n\n(According to the *Purple Text*, this concerns the Sun’s soul, though its meaning is not entirely proper and must be inferred.)\n\nThe above two passages are from a certain master’s writings.\n\n*\"At dawn’s first glow, purple clouds map the dark ridge,*\n*Resplendent, the round light flourishes,*\n*Dazzling, it washes the radiant net.*\n*Vast and distant, the numinous scene’s origin,*\n*Forestalling the empty clarity’s splendor.*\n*The Nine Heavens host jade guests,*\n*In golden chambers, mist and dawn sing.\"*\n\nThe above is from the middle chapter of the *Sutra of the Great Cavern*. Here, several lines are excerpted. (These four lines also appear in the present *Cavern Sutra*.)\n\nForeign lands call the sun *Zhuoyaoluo*. The Perfected One of Square Cauldrons calls it *Round Radiance*. Dreaming of this *Zhuoyaoluo* is the Sun’s response. One who appears amid purple clouds is a spirit of the womb palace—this is the Way of the Mysterious Perfected.\n\nThe Sun’s virtue {broad and yin} is the symbol of long life. Purple clouds at dawn bring peace to the hun and po, health to the body, and tranquility to the spirit. This is where it begins.\n\nWhen the four verses have been presented, the qi and intent become calm and harmonious. (These are Master Yang’s own words in a letter to the Chief Clerk.)\n\nThe Right Florescence’s commentary on the *Sutra of the Great Cavern* explains the meaning of dreaming of *Zhuoyaoluo*.\n\nFarewell. (This is also his own remark. The Chief Clerk’s dream is not clearly described.)\n\nThe above four passages are from Yang’s writings.\n\n*True Reports, Scroll Nine*\n*True Reports, Scroll Ten*\n*Second Harmony of the Auspicious Epoch*\n\n*\"Subtle sincerity moves through principle to stir the hidden Perfected,*\n*Accumulated essence pierces the dark truth.*\n*Gracefully riding cloud hues,*\n*The numinous image leans on purple mist.*\n*Vast and distant, it washes the round net,*\n*Swiftly driving the flying wheel.*\n*Mysterious wings open the dim,*\n*Gazing back, grace renews itself.\"*\n\nThe Chief Clerk, having opened and read the missive, composed a poem in response. (This is the original annotation, which clarifies the intent to elucidate the dream’s meaning. The Chief Clerk wrote it himself. In all *True Writings* and ancient texts, characters imitating forms are rendered as \"fǎngfú.\" Here, it is indeed \"fǎngfú.\" From this character to the character \"也,\" all are written in vermilion.)\n\nFan Youchong was a man of Liaoxi. Conceived through transformation, his form was altered. Now he resides here, constantly cultivating the Three Qi. The method of the Three Qi involves visualizing green-white qi and red qi, each like {a thread extending}, descending from the rising sun in the east and entering the mouth. {The hands are cupped} ninety times, stopping once satiated. After ten years of practice, the three-colored qi naturally reside within the body, and one attains immortality. This is the *High Prime Lord’s Method of the Inner Radiance of Grand Simplicity*. Perform it daily at dawn, practicing with eyes closed. The results improve with each day. The method is rare, yet its effects are profoundly verified. Lord Xu may practice it as well. (Fan is the Central Supervisor of Huayang; the details are recorded in Scroll Four.)\n\nThe above is another passage from Yang’s writings.\n\nThe Jade Consort of Eastern Florescence of the Eastern Sea, Chun Wenqi, transmitted the *Method of Ingesting Mist* to the Perfected Woman of the Containing Reality Terrace, Zhang Weizi. It is to be practiced regularly at dawn, in the stillness of one’s chamber.\n\nSit or recline as you please. First close your eyes and inwardly visualize, faintly perceiving the five viscera. Then exhale through the mouth twenty-four times. Perform this with eyes closed, so that the eyes perceive the five-colored qi swirling and entwining upon the face, guiding them to gather thickly. Then draw this five-colored qi into the mouth fifty times. Afterward, swallow the saliva sixty times. Then softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Great rosy clouds radiate brilliance,\nSpiritual mists drift in all four directions.\nThe qi congeals in the Jade Bend,\nFive colors illumine the Grotto-Heaven.\nDivine smoke embraces and unfolds,\nMetal and stone blossom with true essence.\nPurple emptiness billows in lush abundance,\nRefining the form to preserve its wholeness.\nEmerging in light, concealed in mystery,\nThe Five Spirits transform and divide.\nUnited brightness fans the void,\nAt times riding the six clouds.\nHarmonizing and gathering my body,\nAscending to the Nine Heavens.\"*\n\nAfterward, click the teeth seven times and swallow the saliva seven times. Then open the eyes, and the practice is complete. This Dao is wondrously efficacious. In the Divine Continent’s Mystic Capital, many have attained this technique. Those who practice it long will often ride clouds and mists in their travels.\n\nThe above is another passage from Yang’s writings.\n\nAnother transcribed method: The *Way of Guarding the Mysterious and White* is practiced daily at dawn. Sit or recline as you wish. Visualize black qi within the Mud-Pill Palace, white qi within the heart, and yellow qi within the navel. Let the three qi arise together, like clouds covering the body. Then transform them into fire, which encircles the body. The body becomes thoroughly permeable, inner and outer as one. Practice from dawn until midday, then cease. At this point, ingest qi one hundred twenty times. When all is complete, the Dao is precisely thus.\n\nTo grant one long life and immortality, repelling all harm—this especially forbids the consumption of the flesh of the six livestock and the five pungent flavors. One must sleep and dwell apart, in quiet contemplation. Sexual intercourse is particularly forbidden; engaging in it leads to death. At first, visualize exhaled qi as small as a bean, gradually expanding until it pierces the heavens. Three coils of smoke encircle the body, merging into one undifferentiated whole. Suddenly, fire arises within the three coils of smoke, then combines with the inner radiance to refine the entire body. Within the body, the five viscera become luminously transparent. This, too, is an essential Dao.\n\nThe above two passages were transcribed. All three matters are recorded in the *Huayang Treatise*, Scroll Four. Here, they are copied again, for these are the methods one may cultivate. The original text remains in that scroll.\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate Perfected One decreed: The *Taipei Emperor’s Envoy* (these three characters were later defaced and cannot be discerned again) *Divine Talisman for Annihilating Ghosts and Spirits* is to be encased in a double-layered purple pouch and tied upon the head. (Entering defiled places, it averts [meat and] avoidance.) (These nine characters were further obscured by blue [ink]; with a knife, they are now entirely unrecognizable, and not the characters written here.) The talisman is guarded by two *Direct Envoys of the Three Heavens*. Should any malevolent ghost or myriad evil approach one who wears this talisman, they shall perish. (Below this, ten more characters were also defaced.)\n\n(Where earlier text was indecipherable) men and women each wear one. These have already been inscribed separately. The Lesser Lord now copies this talisman to be worn together. It appears in the *Scripture of the Jade Horse*, also named the *Northern Emperor’s Writ*. (Among the *Seven Primal Talismans*, one lacks a title; tradition holds this to be that talisman, though the *Jade Horse Scripture* has never been seen in the world, and thus no certainty can be claimed.)\n\nOne part realgar, two parts orpiment, three parts massicot. These are the Three Yellow Flowers. First add one part cinnabar to a vessel and grind thoroughly. Next add realgar and grind thoroughly. Then add orpiment and grind thoroughly. Finally add massicot and grind together until well blended. (Mix with clarified glue while grinding.) The term “one” here denotes a single portion by intent, regardless of quantity. (This explains the method of preparing the Three Yellows for talisman-drawing; true talismans often employ this.)\n\nThe above three clauses were written by Yang. When compounding the medicine, one must be precise. Those who lack precision blame the formula’s inefficacy rather than their own failure. Such a person is truly at fault. One may copy the formula and prepare it thus: use five *liang* of calamus (though some use ten *liang*—this is merely the practice of those unfamiliar with the Daoist lineage). Use two *liang* of evodia root bark and three *liang* of purple cloud-lichen blossoms. This is the oral instruction of Lord Zhou. (This concerns the preparation of the initial divine pills; the formula appears in Su’s transmission, having been composed by Zhou Ziyang, and was thus imparted to the Prefect.)\n\nThe above clause was written separately. Prepare one *hu* of processed *atractylodes*. Wash thoroughly with clean water and soak until plump. Then pound finely into powder. Combine with two *hu* of clean water and cook over (gentle fire) until soft. Place in a silk bag and squeeze to extract the liquid. Pour into a bronze vessel and steam over boiling water. Add one (dou) of white honey and a quantity of large dried jujubes, pitted and pounded until skin and flesh are fully blended. Take one (dou) of this jujube paste and mix into the *atractylodes* and honey. Squeeze until thoroughly combined, forming a paste like *bu*. Consume three or four pellets the size of a bullet daily. After one dose, a hundred illnesses vanish; after two doses, ten thousand harms cannot afflict.\n\nThree times, the complexion gains radiance. Four times, the ears and eyes grow sharp. After three years, the countenance becomes like a maiden’s. The immortals do not die.\n\nAnother method:\nPrepare one *hu* of processed *atractylodes*. Wash thoroughly with water and allow to plump. Then dry and pound finely into powder. Take four *dou* of large jujubes, remove the pits, and pound until smooth. Combine with five *dou* of clear wine in a bronze vessel. Simmer and stir until it forms a paste-like preparation. Consume three pellets the size of a plum daily. A hundred illnesses cannot harm you. The face becomes like a child’s, and one withstands cold and frost.\n\nAnother method:\nTake five *jin* of *atractylodes* powder and three *jin* of *poria*, boiled three times. Pound to obtain five *jin* of powder. Combine the two substances and grind together for three thousand strokes. Store in an airtight vessel. Take five *ge* each morning. A hundred disasters, poisons, and epidemics cannot assail you. The face remains youthful, and the body grows strong. With prolonged use, one can leap across peaks and valleys. The ears grow keen, and the eyes bright.\n\n(These three formulas were transcribed by an assistant. They appear to have been transmitted by Lady Ziwei. They follow the *atractylodes* narrative.)\n\n**Method for Refining Hemp Fat:**\nCombine three *hu* of clean water, one *hu* of hemp fat, and two *jin* of *xiebai* (Chinese chive). Simmer the three ingredients together. Cover with a wooden lid to prevent the fat’s essence from escaping. Reduce to one *hu*, then mix with wine for consumption. It may also be taken alone.\n\n(This formula was transcribed by the Prefect. It was originally recorded separately among the *Four-Stamen Elixir* methods. Some versions of the text also include two *jin* of *cong* (green onion).)\n\n**The Supreme Ultimate Realized One’s Belt-Releasing Powder:**\nTake one *daosui* of white powder. Suddenly, the heart will ache as if pierced. After three days, thirst will arise. Once one *hu* of liquid is consumed, the *qi* will cease. Cessation means death. After the body is encoffined, the corpse vanishes, leaving only the clothes behind. This is the immortal who sheds their belt in broad daylight. If one knows the name of the drug, the heart will not ache, but after drinking one *hu*, the *qi* will still cease. Once ceased, it is done.\n\nWhen one senses the abandoned corpse lying upon the earth, jade maidens and jade youths will arrive at that very moment, bearing a blue palanquin to bear it away. Should one wish to pause, the heart will ache for three days, and one must drink in measured portions. This formula may also be used by an entire household. The *Cloud-and-Mist Robe* of nine *liang* is its chief ingredient. (The origin of this passage is unknown; it likely refers to the *White Membrane Powder*. The formula has not been seen in the world.)\n\nThe above passage should not be mixed with those who are not in a state of purification, nor with those who have not embodied the true Dao. Later generations ought to correct this. The highest of the Dao is found in the *Divine Tiger Scripture*. Unless one has received transmission, none may be permitted to see the paper upon which it is written. This is yet another failure to embody the truth.\n\nThe Southern Perfected One said: If the writing of the *Divine Tiger* text is not precise, the myriad things will not serve one’s use, and the heart’s labor will be in vain. When receiving the paper, take care; write with reverence, burn incense, and first inscribe the opening text. One should constantly burn incense beside the written text, ensuring the smoke remains pure and unbroken. Sincerity must be unwavering; the pursuit of the Dao depends solely on tirelessness. Is this not also close to neglect?\n\nThose who attain the Dao always regret not having heard and received it sooner. Those who lose the Dao always regret not having been diligent and earnest. What is meant by *precision*? It is single-minded devotion to the matter. What is meant by *earnestness*? It is reverent cultivation of one’s practice. If one adds to this vigilance and caution, and guards it with the intent to evoke resonance, then one draws near to the truth. You must attend to this without forgetfulness.\n\n(The preceding five passages all seem addressed solely to Lord Yang.)\n\nTo receive the scripture is to take a teacher—yet is this not a cause for shame? Since true sincerity is never exhausted, those who undergo examination are not few. You, sir, once studied *Guardian of the One* under Master Su Lin. You should first purify yourself and receive the precepts. If you can attain this means of transcending the world, the possibilities are beyond measure.\n\nThe Perfected Consort of Nine Flowers declared: To guard the One within the Five *Dou* is the supreme practice of the True One—all methods of the Perfected of Earth. Wang Zhen of Shangdang, Meng Jun of Jingzhao, and Sima Jizhu all first followed this Way at the outset. Lu Nüsheng and Zhang Jun of Handan now dwell on Central Peak and Mount Hua, precisely guarding this One. By this means, one may gradually ascend the Dao and advance without difficulty.\n\nThe One within the Five *Dou* is the inner method of Master Juan. Formerly transmitted within the Terrace of Mount Emei, it surpasses all external practices of guarding the One, the Mysterious One, and their kind—none have matched its traces.\n\nThe Lesser Perfected One said: (The True One of the Five *Dou* is precisely what is preserved and employed in Master Su’s transmission during the solstices and equinoxes.)\n\nThe Middle Perfected One stated: With unceasing diligence, I shall share the Flowing Pearl Perfection—this too is the supreme Way of the Middle Perfected. (The Flowing Pearl pertains to the Nine Palaces tradition; its scripture has not yet emerged into the world. The preceding five passages all seem addressed to Lord Ya.)\n\nIt is further said:\n\nThose of volatile and violent temperament are thieves and maladies to the whole body, yet also the sturdy ladder for seeking the Dao. Those who abandon such ways draw near to the true; those who reform them invite the Dao to come. In every matter and its kind, one must embody gentleness and slowness, exhausting the principles of purity and refinement—thus does one approach the Dao. (This passage seems addressed to Attendant Yuan.)\n\nThe Lesser Mao Lord said: Cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment—every household possesses them, yet not a single person compounds the elixir. All are like the imperial seal, passed from father to son, from son to grandson. Those who love the Dao but lack devotion, whose will is weary and unsteady, whose hearts are clogged with vain reputations and whose eyes are dazzled by superficial allure—ten thousand times ten thousand are like this. Such ways only exhaust the governance of my Three Offices. (This passage seems addressed to Lord Ya.)\n\nLet Xu Fu bathe repeatedly to cleanse the qi of water-borne afflictions and dissolve the accumulated infirmities of long toil—this too is a step toward attaining the true.\n\nThe Perfected One of Purple Yang stated: Infrequent bathing is the nature of the *po*. To defy the *po* and return to the true is to refine away one’s turbid filth until it vanishes of itself.\n\nThe Lady of Purple Tenuity said: This is the method of the Supreme Dao.\n\nLet garments and headscarves not be lent to others, nor shared with those who use different utensils, carriages, robes, beds, or bedding. This is to block the pathways of filth and grime and to guard against the comings and goings of perverse winds. Such practices are exceedingly easy to follow, yet they are deemed difficult—this is because one’s faith in the Dao is not steadfast, and those who seek to ascend instead sink deeper. Why speak of what the heart encounters? They will naturally come to know their own conduct. *(These three precepts are addressed to the Chief Clerk.)*\n\nThe Lady of Southern Marchmount said: *(The above sixteen precepts are all from Yang’s writings, with additional miscellaneous copies by clerks.)*\n\nWhen one lies upon a bed, it should be elevated, for if it is high, earthly qi will not reach it, and demonic breaths will not assail. Demons that invade a person always rise upward from the ground. *(High means three feet or more.)*\n\nWhen one rests in a chamber, it should be kept pure and full. If it is full, it will receive numinous qi; if not, it will receive stale qi. Thus, when qi disrupts a chamber, undertakings will not succeed, and endeavors will not stand. The same applies to the body. One must frequently bathe and cleanse; otherwise, there is no hope. *(The character \"full\" here carries the meaning of \"pure.\" In the Central Kingdom, there was originally no character for \"pure,\" so \"full\" was used instead. This is consistent throughout the scriptures.)*\n\nDo not speak of the Dao while studying the Dao. To speak of the Dao while studying it invites demonic interference, prevents attainment, and causes illness—this is because the body has not yet become true. *(The Azure Lad also said: Every word, every deed...)*\n\nWhen qi leaks and diminishes from the {bamboo instrument}, one must be cautious of this. These three principles originally appear in the {Palace Records, Yang’s Writings, and Yuan’s Writings}. The *Highest Scripture of the Great Cavern: Inner Chapters for Suppressing Demons, Supreme Incantation of the Upper Method* states:\n\nWhenever traveling treacherous paths or passing between demonic shrines—wherever the mind harbors doubts, difficulties, or subtle taboos—one must first command all that is traversed. Begin by curling the tongue inward and swallowing saliva three times. Then, with the second and third fingers of the left hand, press thirty-six times at the root of the philtrum beneath the nostrils, at the inner edge of the nasal septum. Press swiftly without lifting the fingers to count. The edge of the nasal septum is called the *Mountain Source*; it is also named the *Demon Well*, the *Divine Pool*, the *Root of Evil*, and the *Terrace of the Hun-soul*. After pressing, knock the teeth together seven times. Then advance the palm to cover the nose, close the eyes, and softly recite the incantation.\n\nThe Vermilion Bird soars through heaven,\ndivine might unfurls within.\nThe Mountain Source seals the four quarters,\nthe Demon Well flees in rout.\nThe Divine Pool exhales qi,\nthe Root of Evil cowers in hiding.\nThe Terrace of the Hun-soul shines on all sides,\njade chambers resound with tinkling jade.\nThe Jade Perfected stands majestic,\nenthroned to guard the Hall of Light.\nHands radiate purple auroras,\nthe head crowns itself with sacred luminance.\nGrasping and chanting the thirty-nine chapters of the *Cavern Sutra*,\nwithin them are demon-expelling dragons and tigers,\nmountain-severing blades and cliff-cleaving axes,\nfierce beasts and charging oxen,\nswords in jaws and {golden armor} devoured.\nUprooting mountains and seizing the sky,\ndivine birds and venomous dragons,\nsix-headed fire-spewing beasts,\ndevourers of demon kings,\nlightning boars and thunder lords,\ncomets trailing across the heavens,\n{stone owls} ablaze with dappled flames,\nmarching against the wind.\nCelestial birds arrayed in formation,\nall stand beside me.\nSpewing flames a thousand yards,\nto dispel all misfortune.\nHosts of spirits open the Way,\nsealing off mountain villages.\nA thousand gods and a hundred spirits,\nall clasp hands and bow in reverence.\nMarshals bearing lanterns,\nburn incense for me.\nWherever I go or pass,\nthe myriad gods receive me in homage.\n\nStriking the teeth thrice in succession,\nhe then opens his eyes,\nwithdraws his left hand,\nand presses upon the Mountain Source—\nwhereupon the gates of the ghost-[spirit] well seal shut.\nHis hand brushes the Spirit Pool—\nand the roots of evil scatter and disperse.\nHis hand hovers over the Terrace of Souls—\nand Jade Perfected guard the passes.\n\nThus moved by the numinous root,\nheavenly beasts come to stand guard.\nA thousand spirits tremble and submit,\nnone daring to oppose me.\nSuch is the principle of spontaneity,\ncausing all to suddenly become thus.\n\nBeneath the nose, the Mountain Source is the martial ford of the body,\nthe thoroughfare of the true and the perverse.\nThose who are not true give rise to evil qi;\nthose who are true repel the myriad evils.\nIt lies in my power to direct and gather—\nhence the omen of fortune or misfortune.\n\nThe Hall of Light, too, is the literary pool of the body,\nthe dwelling-place of life and death.\nPreserve its spirit,\nand one may peer into the inner vision.\nAbandon its Way,\nand one invites decay and putrefaction.\nThus, by my mastery and compliance with its art,\nthe determination of life, death, regret, and shame is fixed.\n\nThe above passage is drawn from the opening chapter of the *Highest Scripture of the Great Cavern*.\n(This passage was transmitted by uncertain [oral instruction];\na certain Prefect copied it down.\nThis scripture has not yet been revealed to the world.)\n\nWhen traveling by night, one should always strike the teeth—\nthere is no fixed number of times.\nGhosts and demons invariably fear the sound of striking teeth,\nand thus dare not violate a person.\nIf one further rinses with saliva while reciting incantations, it is even better.\n\nThose in the world who know the names of the gates of the Six Heavens’ Palaces—\nno hundred ghosts dare bring harm.\nWhen preparing to sleep...\n\nAlways first face north. Recite the invocation thrice, softly. The invocation reads:\n\n\"I am a disciple of the Most High,\ngoverning below the Six Heavens.\nThe palaces of the Six Heavens are my domain—\nnot only my domain, but the dominion of the Most High.\nI know the names of the Six Heavenly Gates,\nand thus attain long life.\nShould any dare to violate me,\nthe Most High shall sever your form.\"\n\nThe names of the Six Palaces are:\nThe first palace is named *Zhoujue Yintian Gong* (Palace of Yin’s Absolute End).\nProceeding eastward in order:\nThe second palace is named *Tailiang Shizong Tian Gong* (Palace of the Grand Clarity’s Ancestral Affairs).\nThe third palace is named *Mingchen Naifan Wucheng Tian Gong* (Palace of the Luminous Dawn’s Enduring Martial City).\nThe fourth palace is named *Tianzhao Zui Tian Gong* (Palace of Serene Illumination’s Transgressions).\nThe fifth palace is named *Zongling Qifei Tian Gong* (Palace of the Ancestral Numinous Seven Wrongs).\nThe sixth palace is named *Gansi Lianwan Lü Tian Gong* (Palace of the Daring Controller’s Linked Layers).\n\nThen strike the teeth six times before lying down, to ward off all ghostly and demonic qi.\n(This is done thrice in total. These two methods are recorded in the *Capital Register*, now transcribed for transmission.)\n\nThe method of the Northern Emperor’s Ghosts:\nFirst strike the teeth thirty-six times, then recite:\n\"Tianpeng, Tianpeng,\nNinefold Primordial Youth,\nFive Ding Generals,\nHigh *Daochang* Northern Lord,\nSeven Governors, Eight Numinous Ones,\nthe Most High expels all baleful forces.\"\n\nGreat-Long-Skulled Mighty Beast,\nin hand the Emperor’s Bell.\nWhite Owl of the Three Mornings,\nsternly harnessed *{one version: \"hoofed\"}* Dragon.\nMajestic Sword Spirit-King,\nsevering evil, erasing traces.\nPurple qi ascends the heavens,\ncrimson clouds blaze forth.\nDevouring demons, consuming ghosts,\nbody athwart, drinking the wind.\nAzure tongue, green teeth,\nFour-Eyed Old Man.\nHeavenly Ding Warriors,\nmightily suppressing southern inauspiciousness.\nHeavenly *{Horse-Fodder}* rages fiercely,\nmightily restraining northern blades.\nThree hundred thousand soldiers,\nguarding my ninefold layers.\nExpelling corpses a thousand *li*,\ndispelling all misfortune.\nShould any petty ghost\ndare approach to witness this,\nseize the Heavenly Great Axe,\nhewing the five forms of ghosts.\nFlame Emperor rends their blood,\nNorthern Dipper burns their bones.\nFour Brightnesses shatter their remains,\nHeavenly Plan annihilates their kind.\nOne stroke of the divine blade—\nten thousand ghosts scatter and dissolve.\n\n(End.)\n\nEach four-line verse is followed by a single strike of the teeth as punctuation. Whether in darkest night or brightest day, this incantation may be recited as a constant invocation. Should any ghost be subjected to this incantation thrice, its eyes will fester and rot, and its body will perish at once. These supreme divine invocations are all names of the offices that slay ghosts. The Northern Emperor conceals their Way; should any mortal obtain this method...\n\nTo practice this constantly is the Dao of immortality. Men and women, old and young—all may perform it. This is what is called the Northern Emperor’s divine incantation, the ghost’s bane. Should any ghost be subjected to this method thrice, it shall perish of itself. They ever dread to hear these words. When illness strikes, perform this and recover at once. Strike the teeth while gazing inward, visualizing the five viscera. *(One character here—Yang’s edition is damaged beyond recognition; this copy also leaves it blank.)* The five spirits will naturally manifest.\n\n*(This incantation is a secret of the capital; now it is covertly transmitted. It must not be leaked to the uninitiated—only those of the Dao may share its secrecy.)*\n\nThe five entries above were written by Yang and copied by this scribe. Yang’s transcription of the Northern Emperor’s incantation was recorded orally, with many *(people altering)* the text. The origin of wind-illness lies in damp burial mounds, yin moisture, and the stagnation of the Three Springs. Thus, the Earth Office stirs water and qi to clash, often producing wind-bi. In severe cases, the entire body becomes unresponsive; in mild cases, half the body or limbs lose function. If one frequently dreams of the northeast or northwest, wanders old dwellings, or sees places where spirit-platforms once stood...\n\nWhen one’s dwelling nearly adjoins a burial mound—\nthe northeast of a grave is called *Zhengjueming*,\nthe northwest is called *Jiuhu Yi*—\nthese are both inauspicious sites for tomb litigation.\nShould one encounter the deceased therein, the omen is all the more certain.\nFor those who frequently have such dreams:\nupon waking, face upward, tap the teeth three times, and recite this incantation:\n\n“Supreme Primordial, Lofty Mysterious,\nNine Capitals’ Purple Heaven,\nOrder the soul, guard the life,\nExalted Plain Perfected One.\nI bear the supreme method,\nreceive the teaching of the Great Mysterious.\nLong life and enduring vision,\nspirit soars, body transcends.\nTombs and graves forever at peace,\nghostly litigation and treachery blocked.\nSoul and spirit harmonious and joyful,\nmalign qi dispelled without trace.\nWandering specters and formless apparitions—\ndare they offend my spirit?\nThe Northern Emperor rebukes and restrains,\ndraws the qi into the abyss.\nAttaining the *Zhulu* of the Supreme August,\nreverently memorializing Jade Dawn.”\n\nRecite this twice, then tap the teeth three more times,\nand one will no longer dream of burial mounds or the ghosts of deceased kin.\nThis is the Northern Emperor’s secret incantation.\nThose of sincere and virtuous intent may all practice it.\nFor those who frequently suffer inauspicious or ominous dreams,\nthis method may be applied—\nthus ghostly qi is extinguished,\nand demonic spirits scatter and dissolve.\n\n*(This should be transmitted only to those under the authority of the Chief Clerk. Only those of the Xu surname and the *yu* tone are permitted. Now it is said that the northeast is *Zhengjueming*—this differs from other accounts. Moreover, the name *Jiuhu Yi* does not appear in the *Tomb Manuals*.)*\nFor cases where the arms fail to respond...\n\nWhen qi of deep-wind toxin lingers within the vessels,\nbinding and clinging to the bones, causing numbness—\nacupuncture and moxibustion are fitting.\nWith acupuncture and moxibustion, the ailment is cured.\nMoreover, one should apply the Northern Emperor’s Incantation of the Crooked and the Winding.\nIf performed a hundred times, the illness will also dissipate.\n\nFirst, slowly press and massage the arm with one hand.\nAfter a long while, when finished, close the eyes and turn the gaze inward.\nSwallow saliva three times, tap the teeth three rounds,\nand with a composed mind, softly intone:\n\n“Supreme Four Mysteries,\nFive Flowers and Six Courts,\nThree Hun and Seven Po,\nCelestial Pass and Earthly Essence,\nDivine Talismans and Guarding Spirits,\nHeavenly Embryo and Radiant Above,\nFour Limbs and Hundred Spirits,\nNine Joints and Myriad Numina—\nreceive the register from Jade Dawn,\ninscribe the scripture in Jade City.\nJade maidens attend the body,\nJade lads protect the life.\nForever aligned with the Two Luminaries,\nascend as a flying immortal to the Upper Clarity,\nlong abiding with the sun and moon,\nyears extending into the distant future.\nTranscend and rise as an immortal,\nattain the Great Peace.\n\nFlowing wind congeals into sickness,\ninjected ghosts take flight in five directions.\nSpecters and tomb-qi,\nyin-qi swirling about—\nthey encroach upon my four limbs,\ndisrupt my flourishing and decline.\nSupreme Heavenly Ding,\nDragon and Tiger radiate might,\nslaying inauspicious ghosts,\nshattering wind and demonic influences.\nExamine and expose hidden grievances,\nconcealed poisons and wrongs—\nrestore me to my ordinary state,\nsun and moon shining together.\nIf examined and found in violation,\nthe Northern Asterism will seize and crush.\nShould any dare to test,\nthey shall face the majesty of the Radiant Above.”\n\nWhen finished—\n*(This too should be reported to the Chief Clerk. The Chief Clerk suffers from frequent nightmares, constantly afflicted by tomb-injections, and also plagued by drinking accumulations and numbness in both hands. Thus, he is often taught these methods, with acupuncture and moxibustion to follow.)*\n\nIf a disciple is sincere,\npress and massage the afflicted area,\napplying this method.\nHowever, do not require closing the eyes and turning the gaze inward—\nonly swallowing saliva and tapping the teeth.\n\nIn former times, a man named Tang Lan,\ndwelling in the forests of Linlü Mountain,\nwas struck by a ghost,\nhis entire body unresponsive,\nas if wrapped in cotton.\nA Daoist taught him this method of pressing and massaging,\nand the ailment was immediately dispelled.\n\nThis is the Northern Emperor’s Method of the Crooked and the Winding.\nFor all illnesses involving crookedness or winding,\napplying this method is most effective—\nnot merely for wind-numbness or unresponsiveness.\n*(Tang Lan’s origins are unknown; it is unclear from which era he came.)*\n\nThe Northern Emperor possesses these several methods, which are also employed among the schools of the lofty immortals. There is also the *Scripture of the Crooked and the Winding*, stored in the residence of the Western Duke of Clarity. (King Wen of Zhou was the Western Duke of Clarity.) Zheng Zizhen was the grandson of Zheng Kangcheng. He now resides on Yangzhuo Mountain. In his early studies, he suffered for years from unresponsiveness in both legs. In his later years, he used acupuncture and moxibustion, combined with the incantatory method of the Crooked and the Winding, and within a hundred days, all ailments were dispelled. (Zheng Xuan had only one son, who was killed by bandits. He had a posthumous son named Xiaotong. This son neither entered the mountains nor suffered from leg ailments. This Zizhen is also not the one from Gu Valley—his comings and goings are contradictory, and no reliable evidence can be discerned.)\n\nTang Lan now resides on Mount Hua. He obtained the *Method of the Rainbow Elixir* and, having compounded and ingested it, attained immortality. (From the preceding passage to this point, all should be considered *Instructions for Preserving Life*.) Thirteen rounds of acupuncture and three rounds of moxibustion cure all ailments. The left hand surpasses the right. The meridian of the Lesser Yang winds within the left elbow, so thirteen rounds of acupuncture are appropriate to regulate the internal meridian and enter the Lesser Yang. Moxibustion warms the qi, causing it to float upward; when the arm’s blood is afflicted by wind-numbness, three rounds of moxibustion are appropriate to supplement and stabilize the flow of fluids, ensuring the sinews remain unobstructed. Moxibustion should be applied to the *Youguan* of the hand, the *Fengxian*, and the *Five Streams*—these three locations are critically important. One must await an auspicious day.\n\nI now part ways to instruct you separately, ensuring you do not lose this method. The Lady of the Right Central Watchtower once said: *(The three critical locations—Youguan of the hand, Fengxian, and Five Streams—are not recorded in the illustrated charts of acupuncture points or in any moxibustion classics.)* The progression of wind-examination always occurs during moments of weakened qi. When the body is deficient and contracted, illness invades. If you have now recovered, and can truly reduce strenuous activity, the wind-affliction will surely be dispelled. I shall now regulate the qi of the tomb’s inscriptions for you. Since you are slightly improved, you may also ascend the tomb to present your memorial. I will submit it through the proper channels, and thus the inscribed qi will be cut off.\n\nIn former times, a man from Dengyi Cloud Mountain had attained the Dao but suddenly refused to transmit his teachings to either hand. I sent someone to instruct him to apply moxibustion to the Fenghuai and Qujin points. Within six or seven days, he could perform the Five Animals’ Frolics. Once the effects of acupuncture are complete, you should focus on the moxibustion sites. Moreover, meditating on the practice of the Dao is no different from physically performing it.\n\nLong ago, Lord Zhao Cheng’s legs were so debilitated he could not rise. Morning and night, he constantly meditated on bowing to the Supreme. After thirty years, a Perfected One of the Supreme bestowed upon him a dose of Flowing Brightness Sandalwood Elixir. Immediately, he could stand and walk, and later attained the Dao.\n\nHere at the foot of Huming Mountain, when engaging in meditative bowing or mentally practicing the Dao, one should burn incense on both sides, as if preparing to perform a ritual. This is called \"inwardly refining the Great Mystery,\" where the mind enacts numinous deeds, dwelling in the Three Palaces and reposing in the divine precincts. [These are the words of *Preserving Life*.]\n\n*(The Fenghuai and Qujin points are not recorded in moxibustion classics. The \"Tomb Litigation\" chapter lacks a complete version. Neither Dengyi Cloud Mountain nor Lord Zhao Cheng appears elsewhere in extant texts.)*\n\nWhen lying awake at night, visualize the solar image in your right hand, grasping it so that the sun’s crimson radiance ascends from your arm to the elbow and armpit. After a long while, the solar rays suddenly transform into fire, burning through the arm until it is completely permeated inside and out. Then silently recite:\n\n*\"O Radiant Upper Prime of the Four Luminaries,\nAt the division of solar and lunar qi,\nFlowing light shines resplendent,\nInfusing fluid to congeal the hun-soul.\nDivine radiance scatters its brilliance,\nSweeping away filth and refining mist.\nPervading wind and qi,\nAll hundred evils are incinerated.\nGrant me long life,\nWith limbs whole and sound.\nLet the harm-inflicting dead be bound\nAnd delivered to the Northern Asterism.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, meditate for a long while, then release the body and forget the self. [This is *Preserving Life*’s account of the secret incantation for dispelling demons.]\n\n*(This scripture has not yet been revealed to the world. If it is indeed part of the *Sevenfold Wisdom* restricted texts, it is unclear how the Young Lord could have seen it.)*\n\nThe above eight clauses were transcribed by the clerk. Yesterday, I presented the tomb matter to inquire of Lord Xun. Lord Xun said: *\"When extreme yin congeals and stagnates, lingering long in the burial grounds, it causes the earth officials to surge and the tomb spirits to stagnate. Thus, wind and malevolent qi arise and persist. However, as the rushing qi disperses, the afflictions will gradually subside. Sealing and blocking may not be urgent. It would be better to unblock the well of the wife’s tomb to moisten the path of relocation, offering relief to thirsty travelers on the road—a hidden kindness flowing through the crossroads. Plant pear and cherry trees by the Dragon River, and scatter pine and poplar to stabilize the markers. This is what would be beneficial.\"*\n\n(This Lord Xun is likely Xun Zhonghou. This was communicated after the death of the Chief Clerk’s wife.)\n\nFan Youchong, a Han-era Gentleman of the Imperial Secretariat, was skilled in geomancy. He devoted himself to the study of tombs and dwellings. By the end of the Wei dynasty, his teachings had spread to this region during the reign of Emperor Tong. He stated: *\"My present tomb holds the Green Dragon’s commanding qi. Above, the Dark Mystery repels misfortune. The Black Warrior extends its form. Tigers roar across the eight directions. It is nearly a cave of immortals, a归宿 for those refining their forms—truly an auspicious tomb of the highest order.\"* Such were his words.\n\n(This refers to the same Fan Jian who earlier adhered to the Three Qi. Though the Four Spirits share tomb principles, their configurations remain indistinguishable. His designation of the Vermilion Bird as the Dark Mystery is also unclear.)\n\nThose who accumulate goodness, rest in virtue, maintain compassion for all things, and cultivate both the arts of longevity and the treasures within their forms—though they may possess such a tomb—do so merely to demonstrate the cycle of beginning and end. As for the fullness of spirit and the convergence of radiance, when the mysterious mirror opens, how could it ever become a decayed thing, never to emerge again? The occupant of this tomb may well be called one who aligns with the turning of the times.\n\n(These passages all discuss the tomb of the Chief Clerk’s wife.)\n\nThe words of Xin Xuanzi (Xin Xuanzi’s affairs are recorded in Scroll Five).\n\nThe above three clauses were transcribed by Yang.\n\nTo establish the method of an auspicious tomb: after removing the clods, measure nine paces and nine feet backward—this is called *Dark Mystery Repelling Misfortune*. The Celestial Canopy Palace’s royal qi spirit (the *\"Green Dragon Commanding Qi\"*) is Zhao Zidu. The hundred taboos and harmful qi spirits of tombs all submit to it. It can control the essence of the Five Lands and transform misfortune into fortune. For the tombs of marquises and kings, the *Waving Banner* should be raised nine feet, using a stone three feet square (inscribed with *\"Dark Mystery Repelling Misfortune\"*) and buried three feet deep.\n\nThe foolish of the world may possess a thousand scrolls and ten thousand chapters, yet who can truly discern the four phases of fortune and misfortune? Tombs beneath *Repelling Misfortune* succeed by this method—and fail by it as well. Without divinity or sagacity, it is difficult to comprehend. Only those who master this art may do so.\n\nThe descendant (*\"Black Tortoise Extending Its Body\"*) Sun shall suffer no further afflictions of tombs. One who understands the methods of graves can suppress all the thousand taboos and ten thousand prohibitions, invariably transforming misfortune into fortune. Mastery of this method ensures a tomb remains eternally auspicious—its efficacy need not be proclaimed.\n\n*(This sheet, written in an unusual hand on blue paper, may also be interpreted thus: the nine steps and nine feet are specified, rather than ten steps and three feet, because the nine feet enter the tomb’s interior, with the central point taken as the measure (*\"Tiger’s Roar, Eightfold Descent\"*). The *Repelling Misfortune* should correspond to the Vermilion Bird, yet it is placed at the tomb’s rear. For those of the *zheng* household with an *jia* orientation, the Vermilion Bird lies in the southwest; for the *yu* household with a *geng* orientation, it lies in the northeast—this is not debated here.)*\n\nCarve a circle three feet in diameter and inscribe upon it:\n*\"The Celestial Thearch commands the royal qi beneath the earth, within the tomb. Spirits of the Five Directions, Zhao Gongming and all others: for the lord or marquis of such-and-such a state, born in the year of jia or yi, in such-and-such an era, who embodied the qi of purity and truth in life and returns to the divine palace in death, whose form now rests in the hidden realm, abiding in tranquil emptiness—repel and expel all taboos and harmful qi. They shall not dare to act recklessly or inflict harm. Let his descendants flourish, their literary arts attaining the Nine Merits, their martial prowess embodying the Seven Virtues. May they achieve nobility generation after generation, enduring as long as heaven and earth. This is by the decree of the Nine Heavens beneath the earth.\"*\n\n*(A circle three feet in diameter—here, \"three feet\" is implied, though omitted. The method of squaring the circle requires all six edges to be equal, like the shape of a seal. Zhao Gongming.)*\n\nHere now is the translation:\n\n---\n\nThe *Twelve Hundred Official Rites* have mistakenly taken this as the name for \"warm ghosts.\" The Nine Merits and Seven Virtues—these matters derive from the *Zuo Tradition*. When applying this method, one must take care that no one else learns of it. Should there be any insufficiency in the tomb’s royal qi, or mutual harm through clashing phases, inscribe a talisman to suppress it. There is nothing that will not be subdued and pacified, transforming misfortune into fortune. {…}\n\n*(The line below has been cut off. Only one character remains, resembling this. It appears the next line was also trimmed, leaving the sentence incomplete. From the \"three-foot circle\" onward, this is written on a separate sheet, bearing the traces of a different hand—not the same as before. Both are written on blue paper, though the texture and hue differ slightly. It is doubtful that these were copied from an authentic source. As Fan Jian had already remarked thus, I fear later generations may have fabricated the method.)*\n\nOral instructions of the Shangqing Perfected, Feng Yanshou.\n\n*(Earlier, he was described as a beggar from the market of Chu, the Perfected of Western Marchmount, Feng Yanshou. The title \"Western Marchmount\" does not preclude his designation as a Shangqing Perfected. The following fourteen entries, though not seen in authentic texts, align in substance with true methods. Thus, they are compiled separately and appended to the end of this scroll.)*\n\nThe Way of the student must begin with healing illness, ensuring the body is free of deficient evil, blood depletion, brain diminution, or stagnation of fluids and filth. Without first treating illness, even if one consumes elixirs and practices Daoist arts, it will bring no benefit to the body. There was once a Daoist named Wang Zhongfu, who from his youth was intent on such matters and devoted himself to the pursuit of divine transcendence.\n\nHe constantly practiced the method of absorbing and drawing in the twin luminaries and ingesting the auroral mists for over forty years, yet perceived no benefit. His son, however, followed the same practice for eighteen years and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Later, the Perfected of Southern Marchmount suddenly descended to instruct Zhongfu, saying: \"The reason you have not attained ascension is that your body harbors grave illness—your brain palace is depleted, sinews lack fluid infusion, and your numinous essences remain unsurging. Though you have connected with the luminaries and ingested auroral mists, it has brought no true benefit to your body.\" Thereupon, Zhongfu began to take medicinals to treat his illness while continuing his practice. After another eighteen years, he too ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Now he resides in the Dark Realm, where he received scriptures and was appointed Perfected of Central Marchmount, presiding over the Nine Mysteries’ bureau—a post he still holds today. (This account closely aligns with essential matters. No further distinction is made between Zhongfu and his son.)\n\nThe student of the Dao must first pacify the heart and nurture the spirit, ingesting medicinals to treat illness so that the brain palace is filled to fullness and the primordial essence remains unspilled. Only then may one preserve the spirit and ingest auroral mists, drawing in and exhaling the twin luminaries. If one frequently engages in sexual congress, leaking and discharging essence, then qi becomes foul, the spirit flees, and the numinous essence withers to exhaustion. Even if one were to receive the Dark Stave, Jade Records, Golden Scriptures, or the Great Ultimate, how could one escape the bonds of non-life?\n\nOf old, former masters often warned of this matter, saying: \"For the student of the Dao, one act of congress dissipates a year’s medicinal potency; two acts dissipate two years’ potency. Beyond three, the medicinal potency thus dissipated is entirely lost from the body.\" Therefore, the perfected and transcendent ones ever guard against this, regarding it as the greatest taboo against the continuity of life. (This principle accords perfectly with the purport of all scriptures.)\n\nIn the study of the Dao, one must silently nurture the spirit, drawing qi to its utmost and exhaling it gently. One must not speak loudly or shout, lest the spirit and qi become labored and impaired. Those who practice thus do not cultivate life.\n\nFor all who preserve the radiance of the spirit and engage in the affairs of the perfected transcendent ones, they must not lend their clothing to others, nor wear garments not their own. All items such as headscarves, coarse robes, shoes, and clogs should be kept fresh and abundant, for the three hun and seven po may dwell within them, and these are also taboos for the five spirits, as dampness and defilement must be avoided.\n\nOn the eight seasonal nodes, one should observe fasting and solemnity, devising good deeds to advance the methods of the Dao. Beware of anger, contention, joy, or wrath on these days, and do not impose punishments or authority, for these are grave transgressions and great taboos in the eyes of heaven and humanity. These three principles also accord with the purport of the scriptures.\n\nFor all who delve into the profound Dao or recite sacred scriptures, after every ten or twenty words, one should once or twice lick the lips and swallow the saliva. After every hundred or fifty words, one should two or three times click the teeth to summon the spirit and harmonize the blood and qi, allowing the numinous fluid to congeal and fill, so that the Imperial Unity may rejoice in its abode. This is what is meant by \"the qi of the center is not labored, the blood’s inception is not leaked.\" (This is a separate method not found in the scriptures.)\n\nThe method for students: one must not weep tears or spit excessively, for these actions deplete the fluids and leak the essences, causing the throat and brain to become greatly exhausted. Thus, true persons and Daoists constantly practice exhalation and inhalation, swallowing and savoring, to harmonize the six fluids.\n\nOn the days of *jiǎ-yín* and *gēng-shēn*, when corpse-ghosts vie to disrupt the spirit and stir defilement, one must not share a mat with a spouse nor engage in face-to-face conversation. Instead, maintain purity, remain awake, and guard against these days, dispelling all desires.\n\nOn the days of the five *mǎo*, one should always enter the chamber in purification, bow with the heart toward the east, visualize the spirit, and meditate with the hope of perceiving the divine. Whatever one wishes to express may be set forth. Those who persist in this practice will have Jade Maidens descend to attend them. (These three principles also align with the scriptures’ teachings.)\n\nOn one’s own life-day, face the corresponding direction, click the teeth three times, and with the heart, bow twice while softly reciting the incantation:\n\n*\"Great Unity governs life,\nTriple Union of the true.\nChamber of the womb, supreme radiance,\nMother mysterious, Father primordial.\nYou give birth to my five viscera,\nGather my spirit and essence.\nBelow, pour the jade fluid;\nAbove, ascend to the Muddy Pellet.\nAt dusk, refine the seven po;\nAt dawn, harmonize the three hun.\nTo the right, command the Jade Splendor;\nTo the left, summon the Golden Dawn.\nOrdain me as an immortal,\nCommand spirits and employ the divine.\nEver preserve the flowing essences,\nSoaring through the ten heavens.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, bow with the heart to the four directions, click the teeth three times, and swallow the saliva three times. This is called \"The Supreme Way of the Hidden Morning Audience of the Womb’s Primordial,\" the Dao of fetal origin. Practicing this regularly will secure the hun and po, ensuring long life as a divine immortal. (This method is not found in the scriptures.)\n\nWhenever entering the chamber to burn incense, one should always bow with the heart toward the mat, click the teeth, and silently pray, expressing whatever is in one’s mind with utmost focus and devotion.\n\nSurely, one will attain spiritual resonance. (This also follows the example of morning stillness.)\n\nWhenever one constantly visualizes and recognizes their own form, striving to make it vividly present before them, let there always be the radiance of the sun and moon upon the face, illuminating the entire form. Place the sun to the left and the moon to the right, nine inches from the face. Once visualized, click the teeth three times and softly pray:\n\n*\"Primordial Womb, Supreme Perfected,\nTwin Effulgences, Two Mysteries,\nTo the right, embrace the seven po;\nTo the left, restrain the three hun.\nMay my spirit and luminosity\nEver abide with my form.\"*\n\nAfter the prayer, click the teeth twenty-one times and swallow the saliva seven times. This is called \"The Dao of the Celestial Lord’s Form-Refinement, Hun-Restraint, and Po-Control,\" which renders one spiritually radiant as an immortal, attaining long life without death. If the prayer is not recited, one may simply perform the visualization. (This method includes form-recognition but lacks the prayer in the transmitted teachings.)\n\nMoreover, those who study the Dao must first regulate the hun and po, dispelling the corpse-demons. On the last day of the lunar month, the first day of the new moon, the days of *gengshen* and *jiayin*, one should purify oneself, enter the chamber, bathe to cleanse the dust, and sit upright upon the mat. It is best to remain sleepless. With a cinnabar brush, mark the left corner of the eye, and with a realgar brush, mark the right side beneath the nose, allowing a small portion to enter the valley (philtrum). Once marked, first click the teeth three times and softly pray:\n\n*\"Soaring Effulgence, Flying Coils,\nCinnabar and realgar scatter mist.\nSeize the empty evil,\nSink the corpse-filth into oblivion.\nHarmonize the hun, refine the po,\nUnite with the Great Spirit.\nGrant me deathlessness,\nEternal wholeness and longevity.\nClarity of perception, penetrating sight,\nEver-preserved flowing essences.\"*\n\nAfter the prayer, click the teeth three more times and swallow the saliva three times. Simultaneously, press the second finger of the right hand beneath the right nostril and the second finger of the left hand beneath the left eye, each seven times. Maintain the pressure without lifting the hands. These two points are the gateways through which the seven po and wandering corpse-demons roam, the thoroughfares of thieving essence and malevolent qi. Thus, they receive the essence of cinnabar and realgar, sealing the path of corpse-demons, drawing the fragrance of the Twin Effulgences to suppress licentious chaos.\n\nThis is the Supreme Ultimate’s highest method. Practicing it regularly will harmonize the hun and po, disperse corpse-filth, and ensure long life as an immortal with penetrating vision. After three years of practice, lustful thoughts will entirely vanish. (This closely resembles the method of the Supreme Numinous Perfected and may be cultivated alongside it.)\n\nAll methods of Shangqing teeth-tapping and saliva-swallowing follow specific procedures, with a fixed sequence of prior and subsequent steps. They must not be practiced in a disordered or mixed manner, lest the true spirits become confused. Tapping the teeth summons the spirits of destiny; swallowing harmonizes the true. Harmony is received and circulated through the Six Fluids. To govern the spirits, one must sound the drum and proceed in orderly ranks.\n\nIn all practices of the above methods, when performing rituals and invocations, one should first tap the teeth—upper and lower striking each other, not left and right. With each inhalation and exhalation, three taps are ideal. Only after the ritual and invocation are complete should one tap the teeth again before swallowing the various fluids. This is called \"summoning the spirits and harmonizing the true,\" a practice for those who seek ascension as immortals.\n\nI have repeatedly observed that those of false and vulgar habits often misinterpret the scriptural texts, jumbling the sequence and disrupting the order. To employ such methods and expect benefit is truly lamentable. (This aligns with the intent of the *Five Spirits Scripture*.)\n\nHere ends this scroll.\n*Oral Instructions on Nurturing Nature and Prohibitions*\n(Additional entries exist but have not been seen in authentic texts.)\n\nThese two or so transcribed matters—all being immortals’ practical instructions and minor techniques—aid in their application, and thus are compiled together.\n\n**Oral Instructions of the Yellow Immortal Lord:**\nWhen ingesting medicinal substances, avoid garlic and pomegranate seeds. Pork liver and dog’s-head meat are strictly forbidden; total abstention is best. Daoists must never consume pork or dog meat while engaging in chamber arts, lest the efficacy of the medicine be nullified. It is calculated that eating one *jin* [of such meat] wastes a hundred days’ [of cultivation]. Take heed of this warning.\n*(Recorded by a disciple of Peng Zu.)*\n\n**Oral Instructions of the Green Ox Daoist:**\nAt night, before sleep, visualize the sun above the forehead and the moon above the navel. This repels a thousand ghosts and ten thousand malevolent spirits, summoning jade maidens to descend. All misfortunes flee in submission. The method is profoundly efficacious.\n*(This is Feng Junda, as recorded in the *Biographies of Divine Immortals* and the *Preface to the Five Marchmounts*.)*\n\n**Oral Instructions of Shen Xi:**\nWhen taking divine medicines, never face north—this is a great taboo. On *hai* and *zi* days, do not spit, for it depletes essence and dissipates *qi*, shortening one’s lifespan. The potency of the medicine becomes as inert as earth.\n*(From the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*.)*\n\n**Oral Instructions of Lü Gong:**\nOn the day of entering a mountain, before reaching a hundred paces from the mountain, first retreat a hundred paces backward, then turn and ascend with reversed steps. Mountain spirits will not harm you; all malevolent forces prostrate and flee, and every poison conceals itself.\n*(From the *Biographies of Divine Immortals*.)*\n\n**Oral Instructions of Luan Ba:**\nWhen passing through mountains or the precincts of numinous shrines, visualize within your mouth the True Person, the Crimson Numinous Venerable, attended by two jade maidens. One maiden is named Hua Zheng, the other She Jing. The Venerable wears a crimson gauze robe, while the two maidens are clad in yellow above and below. Once the visualization is complete, cry out in a commanding voice.\n\n**Oral Instructions of Luan Ba (Luan of Yuzhang):**\nAt the cry, the ghosts and spirits within the shrine swiftly arrive. Command all malevolent forces to prostrate before the Crimson Numinous Venerable and be slain. The myriad spirits retreat a thousand *li*. This is the method of the Envoys of the Three Heavens’ Frontiers for capturing ghosts.\n\n**Oral Instructions of the Donghai Lesser Youth:**\nDaoists seeking immortality must not lie with women. A single union dissipates a year’s medicinal potency. If one engages in the bedchamber without having ingested any elixir, one’s lifespan is reduced by thirty years.\n\n**Oral Instructions of the Dongling Sagely Mother:**\nThose who study the Dao must guard their speech. Excessive talk invites trials by mountain spirits and the hundred spirits. When lying down at night, close the eyes and visualize the Pupil Child within the *Niwan* Palace, directing the inner gaze toward the body’s spirits. Thus may one attain long life and ascend to heaven. Liu Jing likewise employed this method.\n\n**Oral Instructions of the Wife of the Female Immortal Cheng Wei:**\nWhen consuming elixirs, avoid all blood-tainted foods. Eating such things prevents the expulsion of the Three Corpses. Dried meats, however, are permissible.\n\n**Oral Instructions of Feng Gang:**\nWhen a Daoist falls ill, close the eyes and inwardly visualize the heart, generating fire to burn the body. Once the body is consumed, maintain the visualization until the essence appears faintly. The illness will then be cured. For pain in a specific area, concentrate the fire there. This method is profoundly efficacious.\n\n**Oral Instructions of Chen Anshi:**\nWhen a Daoist ties up their hair, arranges their topknot, eats, drinks, or handles their shoes, pillow, or bedding, they must not allow those who are not Daoists to witness their hair arrangement, dry their food, or disturb their shoes.\n\nWhen using one’s pillow or bedding, the ghosts dwelling within the corporeal forms of the vulgar dead may come to invade one’s spirit. Thus, Daoists who dwell in mountain forests and seclude themselves do so to distance themselves from this clamor and defilement, severing all worldly affairs—fearing that external things, in all their variety, may violate their nature and life. Guard this well.\n\n**Oral Instructions of Li Xiaojun:**\nWhen a Daoist seeks immortality, they must not look upon corpses. Such sights severely harm the spirit and disrupt the qi. Even rulers, teachers, parents, or beloved ones may only be attended in death out of unavoidable duty. Thus, when a Daoist departs this world, they do not serve kings or lords—this is to be without a ruler. To exist alone and apart is to be without companions. Only for one’s parents, teachers, or masters may one attend their funerals, allowing the deepest grief to arise, though it risks injuring one’s nature and life. Yet if one is harmed for this reason, it is as though no harm were done. I guard this teaching closely, passing it on only by word of mouth.\n\n**Oral Instructions of the Female Immortal, Wife of Liu Gang:**\nThose who seek immortality must not lie with women on the ninth day of the third month or the second day of the sixth month.\n\nOn the sixth day of the ninth month and the third day of the twelfth month, one must enter seclusion and avoid all contact with women. If the Six Corpses stir in chaos, the stored blood will be disturbed, scattering and dispersing. The Three Hun will lose their guard, the spirit will wither, and the qi will depart—accumulating until death follows. The reason these days are taboo is not merely to restrain licentiousness or prevent the loss of fluids. It is to pacify the Female Palace, which resides in *shen* (the ninth earthly branch), while the Male Palace resides in *yin* (the third earthly branch). *Yin* and *shen* clash in mutual punishment, and this punitive force intensifies. On these days, the male and female Three Corpses emerge within the pupils of the eyes: the female corpse beckons the male, and the male corpse beckons the female. Disaster and harm flow between them, depleting the spirit and corrupting the true. Though one may not perceive it, the form is already damaged—blood flows from the *Niwan* Palace as the Three Corpses wage war within the eyes. On these days, even the most beloved of women or the most cherished of wives must not be faced. My former master attained immortality solely by cultivating this Dao, without extending exceptions even to the closest kin who might be without intent. You must be vigilant in this.\n\n---\n\nThe *Zhen’gao*, Scroll Ten and Scroll Eleven, and *Jishen Shu*, First Chapter, state: The region of Jinling is the rich marrow of the Cavernous Void, the earthly lung of Juqu. Countless tread its soil, yet none comprehend it.\n\n(These words were orally transmitted by the Lord of Life-Preservation. According to oral tradition, this should have been recorded before the sixth month of the *yichou* year, during the *jiazi* era, when the discussion of this mountain’s blessed origins began. Its soil is fertile, hence called \"rich marrow.\" When waters rise, it floats, hence called \"earthly lung.\" Though generations have traversed it, none have known its true location.)\n\nThe source of Mount Juqu curves to embrace, thus it is named the Village of Juqu. It lies one hundred and fifty *li* across the river; seek, and you shall find it.\n\n(All passages hereafter in large purple script are records from the transmissions of the Three Lords Mao. As these transmissions are treasured and closely guarded, few have seen them. Here, I have carefully transcribed the accounts of the mountain to corroborate and clarify. The mountain’s form bends and winds, extending east and west in meandering turns, hence the name Juqu. The mountain’s ridgeline divides its boundaries: west and north belong to Jurong County, while east and south belong to Yanling. Since Jurong was established as a county, its village no longer exists. In ancient times, it likely lay near Shuxu. Today, the mountain is one hundred and fifty to sixty *li* from the Jiang River at Stone Gate, measured by footpath.)\n\nEast of the Jiang River, amidst the small marshes near Jinling, lies Mount Juqu.\n\n(Here, Jinling refers to Moling, not the \"earthly lung\" of Jinling. The small marsh is today’s Chishan Lake. Gazing directly from the Jiang River toward the mountain, its position aligns east and west as described.)\n\nThis mountain is a cavernous void of inner vision, containing a numinous abode. Its grottoes open in four directions, its caves and peaks stretch long and unbroken. The ancients called it the Void Terrace of Jintan, the Convenient Chamber of the Queen Mother, the Eastern Window of Qingxu, and the Secluded Depths of Linwu. Its caverns interconnect, forming yin paths that lead in all directions—seven routes, nine springs, and four crossroads—making it a true cavern-palace of the immortals.\n\n(This describes the interconnectedness of the grotto-heavens. The Queen Mother resides in the Linwu Grotto beneath Baoshan in Taihu, where the Dragon Might Elder entered and obtained the Five Talismans of Lingbao. Qingxu is the name of the Wangwu Grotto-heaven, indicating that Huayang is linked to this site.)\n\nThe mountain’s shape resembles the character *si* (巳), hence its name, Juqu.\n\n(Today, standing atop the Xuan Ridge of Middle Mao Peak, one gazes before and behind at the ranges and ridges. They coil and curve, with Great Mao as the head, winding east, then north, then west, then north again, then east-northeast to the Great Transverse, folding back and forth like the leftward-written character *si*.)\n\nJinling cannot be harmed by war or flood, nor afflicted by plague or disaster. The *Yellow River Chart*, *Zhong Yao Yuan* Chapter, Scroll Forty-Four, states: \"The altar of Jujin contains a mound where neither war nor sickness treads, nor do surging waves ascend.\" This is the very blessed land. If your heart awakens to this, it is your fortune. Yet know: from whom did this awakening arise?\n\n(This *Yellow River Chart* was received by Shun and Yu, along with the *Luo Book* and its kind. Over forty scrolls remain today. These words were also meant for the Director of Records, signifying that his enlightenment came from the teachings of Lord Yang, which I have further expounded.)\n\nWithin Mount Juqu lies the land of Jinling, spanning thirty-seven or thirty-eight *qing*. This is the earthly lung of Jinling. Its soil is fertile, its well water sweet and pure. To dwell here is to attain transcendence and witness the Great Peace. The *Yellow River Chart’s Inner Yuan Classic* states: \"The earthly lung has good soil and clear water. The mountain of Juqu, the mound of Jintan—here one may transcend the world and ascend to the Curved City.\" The *Yellow River Book’s Middle Chapter* also says: \"The mountain of Jujin contains a mound where neither war nor sickness treads, nor do surging waves ascend.\" This is the meaning.\n\n(The *Yellow River Chart* mentioned later refers to the same passage from the *Zhong Yao Yuan* Chapter. Though the characters for \"mountain\" and \"altar\" differ, the principle remains the same. This specifically describes the earthly lung of Jinling—a single tract of land with such properties. Other places may not share these exemptions.)\n\nJinling was anciently called the Land of Crouching Dragons. The *Yellow River Chart* examines the inverse, and thus records the turning of the kalpas.\n\nThe designation \"to come\" is but a provisional name. As for the name \"Jinling,\" it has already endured for over two hundred years. (Tracing the name \"Jinling,\" it originated in the time of Chu. When the First Emperor of Qin crossed the river, he found the qi oppressive and thus renamed it Moling. Since the Han dynasty, the old county seat lay at Small Danyang, still called the \"former seat\" today. In the third year of Taikang of Jin, the lands south of the Huai River were apportioned to it. In the ninth year of Yixi, the seat was moved to 〈missing〉 [Dou]chang. In the first year of Yuanxi, it was relocated to its present site. This is the Jinling east of the river. The \"over two hundred years\" mentioned in tradition refers to when Sun Quan of Wu sent men to mine gold and encamped at Crouching Dragon Mountain, whence the name \"Jinling\" arose—a natural resonance. Thus does one marvel at the *Yellow River Chart*’s inverse omen.)\n\nIn Qin times, Juqu Mountain was called the Altar of Jugold, for within its grotto-heaven stood a hundred-zhang gold altar, whence the name derived. Beyond it lay Mount Jijin, likewise named for its accumulated gold altars. In Zhou times, its source and marsh were called the Cavern of Curved Waters. Observing the mountain’s sinuous form, later generations combined the names into Juqu Mountain. In the Han, the Three Mao Lords came to govern there, and the elders renamed it the Mountain of the Mao Lords. The Three Lords once each rode a white crane, alighting in three separate places on the mountain, seen by many at the time. Thus arose folk songs, and the mountain was further divided into the Three Mountains of the Great, Middle, and Lesser Mao Lords, corresponding to the cranes’ perches. In sum, all remain but a single mountain—Juqu—without other names. The Three Mao Mountains, though linked in sequence, are but one name: Juqu. Later generations, interpreting events, have since branched it into dozens of alternate names, though originally it was not so. (Today, the southernmost and highest is called Great Mao Mountain, its central ridge crowned by three peaks standing like tripods. The next highest, nearer the rear, is Middle Mao Mountain. To the north, a solitary peak with clustered rocks is Lesser Mao Mountain. Between Great and Middle Mao lies Chang’e, its eastern extension reaching Yanling and Juqu, its western leading to Jurong Lake, forming a continuous stone ridge. Mount Jijin and Horse Ridge encircle it like a rampart. Between Middle and Lesser Mao lies Xiao’e, its eastern and western extensions mirroring the same pattern, linked by a small Horse Ridge. Beyond Lesser Mao Mountain’s rear stretch Lei Ping, Swallow’s Beak, Square Peak, Great Horizontal, and Constant Mountain, all connected in unbroken succession, descending to Po[net] Du. South of Great Mao lie Scallion Mountain, Bamboo Wu Mountain, Square Mountain, and beyond them, a chain of ridges reaching to the mountains of Wuxing, extending to Luofu and ending at the Southern Sea.)\n\nThe mountain yields gold. In the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, an imperial edict commanded the commanderies and counties [to mine it].\n\nThe gold from Juqu was mined to replenish the imperial armory. By the time of Sun Quan, he again dispatched palace guards to extract gold and regularly deliver it to the authorities. A military commander led a hundred households to garrison and settle the land of Fulong, which was then renamed Jinling. As the *Hetu* foretold in ancient times, it was indeed most wondrous.\n\n(To this day, south of Great Mao Mountain, several deep pits and large hollows remain, traditionally called \"Gold Wells,\" said to have been excavated during Sun Quan’s reign. In the eastern foothills of this mountain, fragments of stone often contain grains of gold. The military commander and his garrison once settled in Fulong, but no trace remains today. Only to the west lies Shuxu, formerly known as Zhuxu, now inhabited by common folk. Some ten *li* ahead of Shuxu, near Great Mao, stands Wu Xu Village, whose name appears similar but bears no connection to Jinling. Northwest of the Prefect’s residence, near the small ridge of Changyin, broken shards of pottery and scorched red earth are frequently found, suggesting former habitation. Though the land has been cultivated and no foundations remain, nor any wells, it may be that the Prefect’s well, too, has long since been buried. Neither Lesser Mao nor Great Horizontal show signs of gold mining, and the Gold Wells of Great Mao seem too distant to be the same site—these matters remain uncertain.)\n\nThe soil of Jinling resembles that of Bei[lost city] and the northern valley passes: firm and fertile, well-suited for growing grain. Digging wells here yields water akin to that outside Feng Gate in Chang’an—clear springs with deep, distant sources. The water is white in color.\n\nThose who dwell on this land and drink its water, however, do not pursue the Dao.\n\nThe waters here also grant long life. Are they not nourished by the golden essence of Jin’s fluid? You must keep this secret. I possess a chronicle that records these matters in full—when the time comes, I shall show it to you.\n\n*(This passage was composed by Lord Dinglu, who secretly instructed [you] to reveal it to the Marquis of Xu. The Northern {Lost City} Mountain lies several li north of Luoyang. The Northern Valley Pass is Mengjin Pass. Its soil is yellow-black and rich. Feng Gate is the northern gate of Chang’an. As for the present site identified as Jinling, there are no signs of cultivation, habitation, or well-digging—this is no mere oversight but rather the protection of true spirits, who prevent its careless occupation. My \"chronicle\" refers to the *Biographies of the Three Mao*. According to the Prefect’s records from the jiazi year, no written account existed at the time; thus, this text may have been orally transmitted around the guihai year. The chronicle also describes the land as fine and sweet, fit for dwelling and attaining transcendence—hence these explicit remarks.)*\n\nThe site is modest in scale, covering just over ten *qing* in seclusion, with six or seven *qing* of elevated, level ground. Now that its essence is known, its topography is plain to see.\n\nThe land thus appears clearly—hence it is not obscurely revealed. (The Lord of Life Preservation stated: According to the *Biographies*, the Jinling site spans thirty-seven or thirty-eight *qing*, though this likely refers to its outermost boundaries. As for the verified record, it is indeed just over ten *qing*, with the elevated, level ground being the suitable dwelling place. Ascending the site and surveying it as described, one may readily grasp its contours. One who roughly discerns the location—if they are an immortal transcending the world or one of the seed people—will naturally arrive without hindrance. Yet if unworthy, merely bringing hands to build a dwelling will surely see it fail to stand in any direction, swiftly compelled to relocate. The careless and vulgar multitude must not forcibly claim this place.)\n\nTo the left and right of Jinling lie valley streams and mountain sources. On the left of the ridge stands a mountain, while to the right flows a stream named *Muhuhu* Valley. West of the ridge lies a source called Yang Valley. The *Inner Classic of Named Mountains and Records of Blessed Lands* states: \"The hidden dragon’s land lies west of Willow Valley and to the right of Jintan, fit for lofty dwelling\"—this is precisely the blessed land of Jinling. (Now called Willow Valley, its source emerges from the spring behind the fields of Xiao Mao’s Tian Gong, flowing southwest to the head of Shuxu, where it enters the great [stream]. As for Yang Valley, its name has since vanished, though behind the ridges of Changyin Mountain lies a small [stream], flowing west before turning south, also converging at the head of Shuxu. Elders further say that the source of Yang Valley arises before Zhong Mao and behind Da Mao, where several streams merge into one, exiting the mountain to flow due west before turning north, likewise joining the great [stream]. Where the two [valleys] intersect lies this very site. Its general orientation is east-west, though not perfectly aligned—hence the reference to both left and right. Yet whether today’s two valleys are the same as those of old remains uncertain. Though passed down by elders, transmission has gradually eroded, and the sources’ courses have shifted.)\n\n(Though no fixed landmark may serve as evidence,) in high antiquity this mountain was called Gang Mountain. The *Record of Confucius’ Blessed Lands* states: “Between the ridges of Gang Mountain lies the Hidden Dragon’s Domain, where one may escape floods, ward off illness, and attain long life.” The reason it was originally named Gang is that its substance resembles that of a golden altar. Thus, though a hundred generations have passed and its name has changed a hundred times, it is no longer called by its original name—truly lamentable.\n\n(According to present accounts, a long and massive mountain northeast of Xiao Mao is called Da Heng Mountain, originally named Yu Gang Mountain. This mountain lies east of what is now called the Hidden Dragon’s Domain. The world also refers to the Hidden Dragon’s land as Dead Serpent Ridge, which roughly corresponds to the old name. Observing its length and increasing height, it is also called Chang Yin. *Yin* is pronounced *yu jin* [隱, rhyming with 觐], meaning “to conceal and shield.” Though this Gang Mountain is strewn with small stones, it remains habitable. From the southeast near the Prefect’s residence to the area around Lei Ping, there are many suitable dwelling places. Jiang Yuanchu of Yixing and others have now established fields and homesteads at the foot of the ridge, roughly four or five *li* from the Prefect’s residence.)\n\nBeyond the Golden Court of Tongbai and the Golden Mound of Wu’s Juqu, it is a blessed realm for nurturing the true and a numinous site for attaining the divine. When the waters of the five Yaos poured eastward into the sea, all people fell ill and died—what could the soldiers of Wu’an do to me? For I dwell near the secluded gate of the Terrace of the Sun, relying on this to wander at ease.\n\n(The above was orally transmitted by the Perfected Lord Wang of the Right Assistant [Wang Zhenren] and secretly shown to Lord Xu. This refers to the lands of Wu and Yue spoken of by the Divine Lord of the Dawn of Tongbai. Of these, only the two golden sites are the most blessed. *Wu’an* refers to the Qin general Bai Qi, who attacked Zhao at Changping and in a single day buried alive four hundred thousand men—no military slaughter in antiquity was more brutal. Hence, it is cited here as an analogy. This is what is meant by “soldiers and plague do not come, and great waves do not ascend.” Since it lies near a grotto-heaven and is guarded by divine immortals, it can ensure that the three disasters do not encroach. The preceding five entries are from Yang’s writings.)\n\nWithin the great heavens lie thirty-six grotto-heavens of the earth’s center, the eighth of which is the grotto of Juqu Mountain, encompassing one hundred fifty *li* in circumference. It is named the Golden Altar of Huayang Heaven.\n\n(According to the transmitted records, up to the tenth heaven, these include the five sacred peaks, the eight seas of immortals, and the grottoes of distant barbarian lands. Since these fall outside the present scope, they are not enumerated here.)\n\nThe grotto’s walls are entirely of stone on all four sides, above and below. The flat upper area lies beneath the soil, emerging above ground only after thirteen or fourteen *li*.\n\n(This refers to reaching the summit of the great mountain.) It spans forty-five *li* east to west and thirty-five *li* north to south, perfectly square and level. Its hollow interior measures one hundred seventy *zhang* in height, while the lower part is one hundred *zhang*. Below, the land still rises in mounds and recumbent *earth dragons*, while the upper vault is perfectly flat.\n\n(As previously stated, the high part is one hundred seventy *zhang* and the lower part one hundred *zhang*, meaning the center is elevated and the four sides gradually slope downward. The present statement that “the upper vault is perfectly flat” refers to its surface being level without depressions or protrusions, not that it is flat like a board. It may also mean that when one ascends the mounds, one is lower relative to the heavens.)\n\nWithin its hollow, there shines a yin radiance by night and the root of the sun’s essence by day, illuminating this empty space so brightly that it rivals the sun and moon. The yin radiance governs the night, and the sun’s essence governs the day. Their forms are round like the sun and moon, flying within the dark void.\n\n(According to the various grotto-heavens, each has these names, though with slight differences. They are likely the sun and moon of the great heavens, their essence divided to shine here. Since they govern day and night, they must rise and set, their brightness and dimness matching the sun and moon of our world. At the edge of the great heavens, one cannot reach the end, but the boundaries of this small heaven may nearly be touched and seen. The rising and setting of its sun and moon must therefore have limits, appearing and vanishing suddenly rather than through any aperture. Yet their size remains unknown.)\n\nThe Grotto-Palace of Juqu has five gates: two side gates to the south, side gates to the east and west, and the great northern side gate—altogether five auxiliary gates.\n\n(Today, the great cavern on the mountain’s south side is the western side gate of the southern face. The eastern gate seems to lie within the ridge of cypress branches. The Liangchang Cavern is the great northern side gate, though the eastern and western gates are not apparent. The Middle Lord stated that the eastern side gate lies at the mouth of Small Mao, east of Middle Mao, and that entering here brings one closest to the grotto-heaven, though the outer opening is very small and blocked with stone. Details follow later. Thus, the western side gate should be similarly concealed, likely at the place now called the Stone Tomb. The cypress ridge has two or three cavern mouths, but the true gate may not open there. If one seeks these three gates with pure devotion, they may yet be found. Though the southern side gate’s outer entrance remains wide open, the inner passage is blocked, likely due to excessive defilement. The great northern cavern still sees the comings and goings of spirits and gods, but true immortals do not enter or exit through the five gates—they pass through all barriers as if they were nothing. These gates exist to show the structure of the mountain grotto or perhaps for those from outside who are meant to enter.)\n\nWithin the void, stone steps wind outward to meet the gateways, allowing passage up and down. Those who come and go in haste do not realize they are within the grotto-heaven and assume they tread an outer path. Since the light of the sun and moon is no different, and the plants, trees, waters, and marshes are indistinguishable from those outside, with birds flying to and fro and winds and clouds thickly gathering, there is nothing to arouse suspicion.\n\nSuch is the divine palace of the grotto-heaven—its numinous wonders boundless, beyond discussion or delusion.\n\n(Those who gather herbs in the world often mistakenly enter such grottoes, where all appears thus, and so they do not find it strange.)\n\n(Though none have yet heard of entering the Hua Yang grotto-heaven—such as the case of Zuo Yuanfang and his like, which need not be discussed—even those who do gain entry may fear to speak of it upon their return.)\n\nThe Grotto-Heaven of Ju Qu connects eastward to Lin Wu, northward to Mount Tai, westward to Mount Emei, and southward to Mount Luofu—all great thoroughfares of the Dao. Between them lie lesser paths and branching trails, crisscrossing in countless places. During the Jian’an era of the Han, Zuo Yuanfang heard from travelers that this divine mountain lay east of the Yangzi. Thus, he crossed the river in search of it. After three months of purification rites, he ascended the mountain and found its gate. Entering the hollow of the grotto, he reached the Yin Palace, where the Three Lords bestowed upon him three kinds of divine lingzhi. Yuanfang wandered the grotto’s halls for a year, its chambers and structures laid out with perfect order, filling him with awe. He never imagined the world could hold such wonders. Spirits came and went, adjudicating life and death as if they were earthly officials.\n\n(Now, according to the regional records...)\n\nThen, the Forest Chamber lies to the southeast, Mount Luofu to the southwest—only Mount Tai and Mount Emei stand in the true alignment. The straight path between them should span five or six thousand *li*. This route, passing through the region of Yingchuan, ought to lead directly to the Pure Void Heaven of Mount Wangwu. Yuanfang must have been pressed by the Wei Emperor Wu, and thus returned later. Later, he truly received [oral transmission] and said: \"Only after five years of pure fasting was I able to deeply enter the inner and outer palaces.\" The three kinds of *lingzhi* were likely of the lowest grade.\n\nAt the northern edge of the Good-and-Constant Grotto Palace, where the mountain ridge extends, walk two hundred paces south to find two pairs of white jade discs buried by the First Emperor of Qin, seven *chi* deep in the earth. Above them lies a small slab of stone on the ridge, covering the [sunken] spot. Li Si inscribed the jade discs, their text reading: *\"The sagely virtue of the First Emperor illuminates and pacifies the mountains and rivers. In his imperial tour of the azure rivers, he carved this inscription upon the plain jade. If excavated, they may yet be obtained.\"* Wherever the First Emperor trod upon mountains and rivers, he offered jade discs in sacrifice—not only at Mount Gouqu. (From here onward...)\n\nThe ink inscriptions were all definitively recorded by the Perfected Lord [orally transmitted] to inform the Chief Scribe. The preceding text copied by the clerk is missing its opening passage, which may not have been the original beginning. Upon investigation, the burial of the jade discs occurred prior to the Three Mao Brothers’ attainment of the Dao, yet the full account appears only afterward—thus the Perfected One is revealed to be without obstruction or concealment. According to the traditional account, this event coincided with the imperial ascent of the mountain, though it mentions only a single pair as extraordinary. Perhaps the character *ying* (應) was intended. The inscription on the paired jade discs was likely carved in seal script, similar to that on Mount Yu. Today, upon examining the site, the stone cover can still be seen, and it is by no means small.\n\nAt the northern edge of the Grotto Mouth of Mount Mao lies a mountain called Good-and-Constant Mountain, originally connected to Mount Gouqu—both sharing a single name. In the thirty-seventh year of his reign, on the *guichou* day of the tenth month, the First Emperor set out on his imperial tour. By the eleventh month, he arrived at Yunmeng, where he sacrificed to Emperor Shun at Mount Jiuyi. Sailing down the Yangtze, he observed the sacred catalpa tree, crossed Mei Shoal, passed through Danyang, and reached Qiantang, where he approached the Zhe River. The waves being treacherous, he diverted a hundred and twenty *li* westward, crossing through the gorge. Ascending Mount Kuaiji, he sacrificed to the Great Yu, gazed toward the Southern Sea, and erected a stone stele to extol the virtue of Qin upon Mount Kuaiji. Li Si petitioned to inscribe it, and the Emperor then returned. Passing through various mountains and rivers, he eventually ascended the northern ridge of Mount Gouqu and buried a pair of white jade discs. There, he assembled his officials, feasted with his retinue, and sighed, saying: *\"The joy of imperial tours is unmatched by mountains and seas. From this day forward, let it be a constant practice.\"*\n\nThen the assembled ministers all raised their cups in toasts, chanting: *\"May it be a constant practice indeed!\"* Again, great drums resounded, great bells were struck, and ten thousand voices joined in unison, shaking the mountains and marshes. The auspicious omens of praise and music were all deemed excellent. Thereupon, the northern ridge of Mount Gouqu was renamed Mount Liangchang, its name derived from this very meaning.\n\n*(According to apocryphal records: In the thirty-seventh year of the First Emperor of Qin, in the first month, he set out on a tour to Yunmeng, Danyang, and the Zhe River, ascending Mount Kuaiji to sacrifice to the Great Yu and gaze toward the Southern Sea, where he inscribed a stele to record his achievements. On his return, he passed through Wu, crossed the river, and traveled along the northern sea until he reached Langye. In Pingyuan, he fell ill, and on the *bingyin* day of the seventh month, he died at Shaqiu. In the ninth month, he was buried at Mount Li. At that time, no defilement had yet occurred. Thus, he took the path from Yanling, ascending through Jurong, and the route along the river still passed through the place where the feast was held—it was not necessarily a deliberate visit to Mount Gouqu. The reason for halting and staying at the northern foothills was not to proceed further over the ridge. Moreover, at that time, the mountain’s numinous marvels had not yet been verified. The purpose of the jade disc offering was to establish a connection with the mountain in view, as the sovereign had declared: *\"All mountains and rivers trodden shall be honored with jade discs.\"* Names follow their owners, and designations arise from the land itself. Later, during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, a minor sovereign received an oral transmission of a purple text stating: *\"Governance shall be established in the northern cavern of Liangchang.\"* This likely became the basis for the name’s adoption.\n\nAnother examination of records shows that upon the First Emperor’s death, his passing was not announced. Instead, his carriage was laden with salted fish to conceal the truth. This corresponds to the sixth month of summer, aligning with apocryphal accounts. However, according to transmitted records, it was the tenth month of the thirty-sixth year, the *jianhai* month, which served as the first month of the Qin calendar. Thus, his tour extended only to Yunmeng. Otherwise, he would have died in the autumn of the thirty-eighth year. Since the Qin calendar was not yet established, it is impossible to definitively determine which month the *guichou* day fell in. This matter requires further detailed verification.)*\n\nIn the third year of Wang Mang’s *Dihuang* reign, on the *wushen* day of the seventh month (the twenty-fourth day of the month), he dispatched the emissary Zhang Chuan with a gift of one hundred *yi* of gold and five bronze bells to present to the Three Immortals of Mount Gouqu. *(Wang Mang’s system used gold as currency, calling it* yi*, shaped like coins but without holes, each weighing one tael and worth one thousand coins. One hundred* yi *thus equaled one hundred taels.)* In the seventh year of Emperor Guangwu’s *Jianwu* reign, on the *dingsi* day of the third month (the twenty-fourth day of the month), he sent the emissary Wu Lun with fifty *jin* of gold to offer to the Three Lords. These gifts were buried together at the highest point of Mount Xiaomao, where the earth had subsided, forming a mound of stones three to four *chi* deep. *(This refers to the present-day highest point of Mount Xiaomao, where the piled stones are located. These two events are not clearly recorded in oral transmissions.)*\n\nIn the second year of Emperor Ming’s *Yongping* reign, an imperial edict commanded prefectures and counties to repair and maintain the shrine of the Perfected Ones of Danyang’s Mount Gouqu. *(Upon the Three Lords’ initial attainment of the Dao, they rode white cranes and appeared on the mountain’s summit, witnessed by villagers who, moved by their efficacious responses to prayers, jointly established a shrine on the mountain’s eastern side, naming it the White Crane Shrine. During sacrifices, voices were sometimes heard, white cranes were seen within the curtains, or the sounds of music and performances were perceived. Thus, the people competed to serve and attend them.)*\n\nThis shrine still stands today in Ping’a Village on the mountain’s eastern side, where a woman surnamed Yin serves as its invocator. Subsequently, villages on the mountain’s western side each built their own shrines: the western slope of Great Mao became Wuwu Shrine, while the rear of Central Mao’s summit became Shuwu Shrine. All observe annual sacrificial rites with drums and dances, akin to blood sacrifices. By this time, they had fallen under the jurisdiction of the Western Brightness Bureau, no longer the retinue of true transcendents.)\n\nAt the uniquely lofty peak of Central Mao’s Black Ridge, the Lord of Life buried six thousand *jin* of cinnabar from the Western Hu’s Jade Gate in this mountain, at a depth of over two *zhang*. The sunken ground above is secured on all sides by small flat stones. On either side of the mountain, where spring water flows downward, the water takes on a faint reddish hue, and drinking it benefits one’s health. Below this mountain, on both sides, there are also small level areas suitable for quiet dwellings.\n\nAt the time, Zuo Yuanfang sought cinnabar from the Lord of Life and obtained only twelve *jin*. (Today, this ridge is strewn with many large stones, though no steady streams flow on either side of the summit. To the southeast, near the base, lies a long ravine, while to the southwest, near the base, there is also a small stream. South of the ridge, where recluses dwell, a gushing spring near the summit flows ceaselessly through winter and summer, though its water does not appear distinctly red. The level areas are habitable, with the best locations being near the ravine on either side. Zuo’s request for cinnabar likely occurred when he entered the grotto, intending to refine the Nine-Splendor Elixir in the furnace.)\n\nGreat Mao and Central Mao are connected, and within the long vale between them lies a continuous outcrop of stone, anciently called Mount Accumulated Gold. This mountain abounds in golden substances, and the area is well-suited for habitation. One should seek out watered sites to build quiet dwellings—this would be ideal. Any of these several locations will suffice for elixir refinement and the cultivation of the supreme Dao.\n\nBefore Central Mao and behind Great Mao, at the base where a long ravine extends east and west, the mountain opens outward to face a lodge. (This is the east-west ridge where recluses now dwell. The ridge is composed entirely of stone, its forms remarkably strange, with many perforations and side cavities winding deeply downward, some bottomless. When brittle objects are cast in, they produce prolonged, resonant echoes. The claim that the area abounds in golden substances likely refers to items cast here by transcendents over time. To the southwest stands a great stone cliff, split open to reveal a grotto within. After entering several *zhang*, the passage narrows until it no longer accommodates a person, though a rushing wind howls within. Just a few steps outside, a gushing spring flows year-round, providing water for those below. Near the ravine’s mouth, another spring surges upward, its waters swift—warm in winter and cool in summer. Directly opposite, slightly downslope, lies yet another aperture with an extraordinary gushing spring. Neither great floods nor severe droughts alter its flow; its water is slightly white, sweet, soft, and gentle, pouring forth endlessly. The only regret is its location on the mountain’s western side, preventing it from flowing east. One could, however, channel it separately to flow eastward for use.\n\nCrossing this ridge to the southeast, a stone grotto’s water flows eastward, exceptionally fine. The site is secluded and sheltered, highly suitable for elixir refinement.)\n\nJust beyond lies the aforementioned Jun Mountain. The sole concern is its proximity to the main path, where the rumble of carts and the voices of travelers are nearly audible. If this road were severed, cutting off the sounds of passing carts and footsteps, this would become the finest site. Careful consideration must be given to its suitability.\n\nOf the dwellings on Mount Mao, only the present hermitage and the residence of the Chief Clerk at the southern cave mouth are truly excellent. The only regret is their remoteness and openness. Moreover, this entire mountain is free from venomous creatures—no centipedes, vipers, or scorpions. Though green snakes appear from time to time, they harm nothing. Tigers are also rare, and since ancient times, no one has been harmed here. Whether Daoist or lay, those who dwell in these mountains seldom suffer from febrile illnesses. The mountain’s virtue is vast and accommodating, never harsh or perilous. The only lament is the absence of verdant forests that remain lush year-round, as on the eastern ranges.\n\nSince residing here in seclusion, the refining of qi has nurtured refinement, and in appearance, one appears far better. The mountain yields fine atractylodes and various medicinal herbs, and is most suited for pine and cypress—though none were planted by human hands, and they grow only where nature allows. Now, they are dispersed and cultivated annually.\n\nAt the Celestial Market Altar on Mount Mao, on all four sides lie treasures: gold and white jade, each weighing eight or nine thousand catties. They lie just over two *zhang* from the altar’s edges, buried nine *chi* beneath the earth.\n\nLong ago, the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea once rode a chariot drawn by solitary whirlwinds and flying wheels, traversing all the grotto-heavens’ mountains in his circuit. He once came to this mountain as well. On either side of the mountain flow springs, their waters infused with the essence of gold and jade. It would be most excellent to seek out a small, tranquil spot here for a hermitage. Drinking this water greatly benefits one’s essence, and it may be used to compound elixirs.\n\nThe stone altar of the Celestial Market lies precisely above the central Mystic Window of the grotto-heaven. This stone is from the Celestial Market Mountain of the kingdom of Anxi, and thus it is called the Celestial Market Altar Stone. During the reign of the Dark Emperor, he summoned the gods of the Four Seas to transport this altar stone and place it above the grotto-heaven. This was not done for Mount Juqu alone.\n\nBeneath the immortals’ market altar lies the central window of the grotto-palace. The hollow within Mount Juqu’s belly is called the Grotto-Terrace Immortal Court. During the reign of the Dark Emperor, he summoned the gods of the Four Seas to transport the uncut jade and precious stones of Anxi’s Celestial Market Mountain, using them to fill the central Mystic Window above the grotto-heaven.\n\nThe Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea once rode his chariot of solitary whirlwinds and flying wheels, traversing all the mountains of the Grotto-Terraces. In each, he buried treasures of gold and white jade, eight or nine thousand catties each, around the market stone on all four sides, to suppress the yin-palace peaks. All grotto-heavens are thus—it is not only Mount Juqu.\n\nThe locals call the Celestial Market Altar Stone the \"Immortals’ Market Altar,\" though their understanding is but a faint resemblance, unclear in detail. The traces of the Azure Lad’s whirlwind wheels remain distinct even now.\n\nOf Mount Juqu’s features, all records now make clear distinctions—only the location of the Celestial Market Altar Stone remains uncertain when tracing its actual whereabouts.\n\nThe hidden dimensions should properly lie to the left and right of Great Mao Peak, yet no trace of their peculiarities is found in traversal. Perhaps they have been overgrown by earth and timber—this remains undiscussed. According to the *Baoming* records, whenever Master Zhao Cheng ascended the altar and let forth a long whistle, wind and clouds would instantly arrive. This suggests the site cannot be a minor location. Cloud vapors are often seen emerging and entering, always first rising from the northern yin side of Great Mao Peak—perhaps because the height and shade favor such manifestations. The Perfected One customarily drives a nine-dragon chariot, with the left flank steed named Whirlwind and the right flank steed named [ ]. Having trodden the mountain’s summit, he would point and mount the right steed. Today, atop Great Mao Ridge, a path extends eastward, its sides leveled as if by human labor, wide enough for wheel tracks. By common account, this is called the \"Whirlwind Wheel Trace,\" and it remains unburied. Yet the stone altar is not manifest, and the buried gold treasures are equally difficult to locate. It is also doubtful that the grotto-heaven’s central Mysterious Window should lie so near the southern gate; perhaps it is instead among the Middle Mao peaks. The village elders, too, no longer know the location of the Immortals’ Market Altar. Since my seclusion here, seven or eight years have passed, and I have yet to exhaustively traverse the mountain—how much less could the careless masses ever fathom its depths? The reason I have not fully explored it lies in the lack of worthy companions to share the journey. The hardships of ascent are daunting, and traveling alone feels [ ]. Thus I have lingered here, a source of constant shame and regret.\n\nOf late, I have wandered alone with my staff, hoping to record in detail all that I hear and see.\n\nOn the eastern side of Middle Mao Mountain lies a small cave. Its mouth is no larger than a dog’s burrow, barely wide enough for a person to enter. Yet the deeper one goes, the more spacious it becomes. A massive boulder seals the entrance, leaving only a small opening the size of a cup, guarded by the mountain spirits. This boulder occasionally opens of its own accord—it is called the Hidden Palace’s Lateral Gate. After purifying myself through fasting, I sought it out and found the way in, easier to traverse than the entrance to the Good-and-Constant Grotto. Within, many sandy paths twist and turn, and where they cross streams, passage is not always smooth. The route is also long, less convenient than the small Lateral Cave’s entrance. Descending straight down for three or four *li*, one arrives directly at the Hidden Palace’s Eastern Mysterious Side Gate. Two hundred paces inside the cave’s mouth, the darkness suddenly gives way to daylight. (This is the grotto-heaven’s eastern gate, its hidden dimensions now discernible. Yet I have not dared to venture in lightly. Earlier accounts claim the cavern palace extends thirteen or fourteen *li* beneath the earth, whereas this passage reaches the Side Gate in only three or four *li*. This is because the entrance lies near the mountain’s base, and the gate itself is not level. One must descend several more *li* after entering to reach the palace proper. The instant brightness within is due to inner light illuminating the space, not sunlight from outside.)\n\nGreat Mao Mountain also has a small cave on its southern face, nearly identical to the first. It is called the Southern Convenient Gate, its mouth likewise sealed by stone. However, if one purifies the heart with sincere fasting and directs devotion to the Controller of Fate, ascending the mountain on the second day of the month to extend invitations and offer prayers, one will naturally be granted an audience. If sincerity is absolute, how could the Hidden Palace remain unseen? What manner of man was Zuo Ci? (This is the eastern Convenient Gate on the southern face, likely located among the stone caves of the Cypress-Branch [Stone Dragon]. Many small caves dot this [Stone Dragon], making them difficult to distinguish at a glance. Only through profound spiritual resonance will the way open.)\n\nShould one then consider entering, the \"second day\" refers to the second day of the twelfth month. According to tradition, there are two such days in a year—lest the eighteenth day of the third month, being clamorous and bustling, prove unsuitable for undivided devotion. Zuo Ci, having attained the immortal’s form, was readily perceived beyond the common. Thus, with a pure fast in the third month, he gained entry to the grotto. Though the Prefect’s bearing was noble and his advancement assured, his understanding remained obscured—how could he compare? These words were meant to encourage him. The Prefect’s later response echoed this sentiment, reciprocating in kind.\n\nOn the eighteenth day of the third month and the second day of the twelfth month, the Eastern Minister, the Lord Controller of Fate, ascends as the Supreme Perfected Sovereign of the Gathering Essence. The Perfected of the Great Void and the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea convene upon Mount Gouqu, touring the grotto-chambers. Those who cherish the Dao and seek divine transcendence ought to purify themselves in advance and await these days, ascending the mountain to make their entreaties. Those of steadfast devotion and absolute sincerity will be met by the Three Lords, who shall draw them near, impart the essential Dao, and guide them through the grotto-gate. They shall avert the calamities of war and flood and behold the Sagely Lord of Great Peace. (As recorded in the *Book of the Central Lord...)\n\nThose who regularly ascend the mountain on these two days to extend their welcome, offer prayers, and make entreaties—referring specifically to the second day of the twelfth month—rarely observe the eighteenth day of the third month, though it has occasionally fallen in the first month. Nowadays, the second day of the twelfth month is often bitterly cold with snow, and few from near or far come to the mountain. Only on the eighteenth day of the third month do officials and commoners gather in throngs, with hundreds of carriages and four or five thousand people, both Daoists and layfolk, men and women, their numbers resembling the crowds of a bustling city. They ascend the mountain together, chanting the *Lingbao* hymns of praise, and once the rites are concluded, they disperse. How can there be any among them with profound sincerity or secret communion, yearning to behold the divine Perfected? Even if one or two truly devoted souls appear, they are hindered by the clamor and defilement, unable to focus their minds or express their devotion. Thus, those who seek to be drawn near and receive favor have no means of attaining their goal.\n\nOnly in the secluded dwellings of the central cliffs, where access is restricted and the years kept pure, can one avoid the mingling of crowds. Since these places lie beyond the grotto and across the ridge, people naturally remain unaware of them.\n\nOn the southwestern slope of Mount Liangchang, there are habitable sites—former residences of the Lord Controller of Fate—where one may also compound the elixir. (When the Lord Controller first crossed the river, he established his dwelling here to purify himself and confront spirits and ghosts. Now, the term \"slope\" [*chui*] suggests a boundary or edge, and this location should properly lie west of the great ridge behind the Director’s residence. Yet elders today claim it is the flatland northwest of Great Mao Peak, among the pear trees of the low-lying area called *Xiabo*, said to be the former abode of the Lord Controller. The soil there is rich from cultivation, and many bricks, tiles, and relics of former habitation are unearthed, confirming it as a place once dwelt in. It is also said that the site is potent and must not be defiled. If this is indeed the case, then it should be described as west of Central Mao Peak, not so far as Liangchang. The statements of the Great Perfected are generally imprecise, mentioning whatever location they happen to cite.)\n\nIn former times, the forests and thickets at the foot of the mountain stretched far and wide, obscuring the sky and blocking the sun, offering countless secluded retreats. Now, with logging and farming, the land is open and accessible in all directions, and even the mountains have become exposed. Times change, and circumstances differ—no longer can the past serve as a standard. Yet these claims are not of long ago.\n\nSuch conditions have only grown more severe over the past fifty or sixty years. To the southeast of Liangchang, there is another habitable site. Among these places, one may find piled stones resembling the shape of a stove. Within the stove, there may grow a *jisheng* tree, its form curved like a canopy. This site is most excellent—only regrettable for its shallowness. Yet it remains sufficient in itself. (This place still exists today, though no longer with the *jisheng* tree of curved form. It lies near the northern cave’s flowing waters, and on either side, it borders the main road—hence its shallowness. Now, it has become desolate and remote, no longer a place one might go.)\n\nTo the northwest of the cave’s entrance lies a small, precarious plot of land, unstable and unsafe. Yet it would suffice for building a quiet retreat outside. (Today, much of this area has fallen into ruin, gradually encroached upon by villages. It is no longer fit for dwelling. In former times, it was said to be somewhat near the county, making travel convenient, and close to the cave’s entrance—hence its frequent mention. The outer quiet retreat was meant to accommodate traveling guests for rest, not as a place for one’s own cultivation. This further confirms the intent to keep proximity in mind. In the version compiled by Layman Gu, the section on the hermitage sites near this area was originally placed here. Yet in the copy reviewed by the scribe, it was not included in sequence but instead appeared separately before the residence built by the Prefect. In the Prefect’s later reply, he spoke of the northwest land’s instability and then proceeded to discuss Jun Mountain, ignoring the earlier mention of the Golden Village retreat—clearly indicating that the original was transmitted orally.)\n\nWithin the Juqu Mountains lies a place called Jun Mountain. This mountain is most fine. It also possesses gold.\n\nOne may go there to mine it, digging no more than one or two feet into the earth. When I was about to depart, I once buried gold here—those who wish to ingest gold may go and retrieve it. However, one must not use it to pursue private gain and thereby incur burdens.\n\n(Nowadays, people no longer recognize the name Jun Mountain. Examining its form, it should resemble a mushroom standing alone, or perhaps it is [oral corruption of] \"Cang\" [苍], shaped like [ ]. According to the records, behind Great Mao Peak and east of Chang’a, in the valley where gold accumulates, there stands a solitary hill, towering like a Boshan incense burner. Moreover, it lies near the Gold-Accumulating Mountain, so this may well be the place. Today, it is overgrown with rocks and trees, and though the gold’s location is indicated in one or two spots, it would be difficult to search for. Only if you deign to grant permission would it be possible—no question of that. If one intends to undertake the work of refining and transmutation, this mountain’s front faces a long ravine where eastward-flowing water runs deep and secluded, possessing a favorable topography. Should construction ever be planned, I will provide further details.)\n\nOn Great Mao Mountain, there is a bronze tripod from the time of the Dark Emperor. (The ancient character for \"tripod.\") The tripod can hold four or five *hu* or so. Its casting and engravings are exceptionally fine, and it lies in the mountain’s highest spot, buried eight *chi* deep. A slab of stone covers it. The Dark Emperor commanded the Spirit of the Eastern Sea to conceal it here. (This was likely buried when the Anxi stone was relocated. Today, the highest point is strewn with rocks, and on auspicious days, Daoists from near and far all ascend to burn incense and pay homage. No grass or trees remain, only a small altar built of piled stones. There once stood a small tiled hut, but it collapsed in the wind. Since ancient times, emperors and kings have prized tripods because their two handles emulate the sun and moon, their three legs represent the Three Powers, and they can cook and transform the myriad things. Moreover, they possess the numinous ability to alter weight, concealment, and manifestation.)\n\nThe Middle Lord later replied, saying: \"It was cast from the copper of Feather Mountain. (All mountains with grotto-heavens are like this.) Beneath Great Mount Mao there is also a spring. Below it, one may establish a quiet abode. The area near the water’s mouth is best—only slightly perilous and unstable. (Today, near the southern entrance of the great grotto, there is fine flowing water but many rocks. A short distance downslope, the land levels out. In recent generations, some have come to dwell here. Only in the early Song did the Daoist nun Xu Piaonü, supported by Prefect Lu Hui of Guangzhou, live for many years before her passing. Her disciple, surnamed Song, was a woman of lofty purity, untouched by worldly concerns. She grew old and died, and was buried south of the mountain. Song’s disciple, surnamed Pan, then inherited the residence and remains there to this day. During the Yuanhui era, several men also came to dwell in the area. By the early Qi dynasty, an edict was issued to Wang Wenqing of Jurong, who established a lodge here called Chongyuan. Halls, chambers, and side corridors were built, making it quite grand. Typically, seven or eight Daoists resided there, all supported by official stipends. For over twenty years, men and women from near and far have gathered here in succession, their dwellings stretching for several *li*, with over ten compounds. Yet those who truly study the supreme Dao are few—most merely perform Lingbao fasts and draft talismans. Recently, a woman has come to live at the grotto’s entrance, diligent in sweeping. She calls herself a ‘grotto officer’ and engages in shamanic divination, though much of it is frivolous and false. Such examples exist everywhere.)\"\n\nThe eastern and western sides of Great Mao Mountain also have streams. During the late Jin dynasty, the place where the accomplished Daoist Ren Dun resided remains, with his alchemical furnace and earthen stove still extant. Today, several individuals such as Xue Biao live there. There is also Zhu Fayong, who dwells near a small hill, enjoying the expansive view but lacking water.\n\nLiangchang Mountain faces the cave’s entrance to the east, gazing toward the ridge of the small hill. Atop it lie several thousand *jin* of buried bronze, sealed beneath massive stones. During the Han dynasty, the Qu family, who lived at the mountain’s base, were immensely wealthy, possessing hundreds of millions in wealth. They buried bronze vessels there, which remain to this day. There is also coinage, located on the western slope of the small northwestern hill.\n\n(Today, this mountain still exists, though none know the exact location of the bronze or coins. Even if there are vague traces, they are unrecognizable. Upon examining the mountain’s terrain—its heights, depressions, and streams—it does not resemble a site of former villages or settlements. Perhaps due to the passage of ages, its features and traces have altered.)\n\nFormerly, two letters were received, one on the first day of the third month and another on the eighth day of the eighth month. (These were received in a *yichou* year, while the previous year’s letter from the Prefect was dated to a *jiazi* year. The reply stated that the letter was simply placed in the quiet residence of the Zhu family in Shuxu, not delivered by Hua Qiao or Yang Jun.)\n\nThe letter of the first day of the third month states: *\"Now we must reclaim the Red Stone Fields, making them a path for daily comings and goings.\"* Yet the task was never completed. It further says: *\"How can one idly sit and watch the living and dead?\"* This speaks to the sincerity of resolutely seeking the true Dao. *\"If the heart is not in it, one cannot hold others accountable or ensure success.\"*\n\n(The Red Stone Fields lie over ten *li* west of Central Mao Mountain, where a large pond once drew from the stream but fell into disrepair. The recluse has since restored it, cultivating over ten *qing* of fields. The Prefect once intended to conceal his traces by using the fields as a pretext, allowing him to gaze upon the sacred mountains from several vantage points. However, drought caused the pond to fail, and the plan was never realized.)\n\nThus, this letter gently mocks such claims.) Yet though he lacks a proper study, his letter speaks of fasting and purification. (There is also a reply to this: solemn words in memorials must not be lightly or recklessly composed—every movement and stillness must be thoroughly heard and understood.)\n\nOn the eighth day of the eighth month, the letter states: *\"I humbly discipline myself and journey to the summit of Great Mao, beseeching to be specially received and recorded, that my eyes may behold your warm countenance and my ears hear your jade-like voice.\"* Such words reveal an urgent longing for the Dao. Having received your recent letter, I see your utmost sincerity and can thus diligently encourage your aspiration for the Way.\n\nThe Lord of Life resides in the Eastern Palace, and letters should not be combined indiscriminately, for virtue and rank differ in weight. (The Lord of Life permanently dwells in the Red City of Great Huo, while here there are only officials of the prefectural bureau. As positions vary in dignity, it is improper to compose a joint address. Though the two lords both reside in Huayang, their offices differ, and their letters must not share the same page. Generally, written memorials are not as effective as oral petitions—here one may clearly observe the proper forms and standards.)\n\nWe already know one another well, and the distinctions in our letters and correspondence are quite evident. How could I wish to cease them? (This refers to the Prefect’s careless habit of leaving letters in others’ quiet quarters before departing, fearing that if visitors arrive later, the contents may be leaked.)\n\nThe true numina guard their secrets closely, hence these words—to test the sincerity of one’s intentions. (The Prefect’s later reply to this was also rather artful and evasive.) These letters and documents must be kept from the sight of common folk. Should any layperson see them, they would dig up and desecrate the sacred mountain—your offense would be grave indeed. (This fears that cunning and avaricious men, learning of these golden treasures, would be capable of tunneling into the mountain, thus spreading the secret. Such a transgression would be no light matter. Not only would it violate the present admonition, but it would also leave an endless legacy of harm, burdening future generations. All must keep this strictly concealed.)\n\nThe above is the Lord of the Register’s reply to the Prefect’s earlier letter, concluding the discussion of matters concerning Mount Juqu. The Prefect’s original letter is no longer extant; only this later response remains, arranged here in order of the topics addressed.\n\nThe preceding twenty-one items were all transcribed by clerks. In my youth, around ten years of age, I heard elders in Xuxu (this should be written as *xu* [墟], though it has long been rendered as *xu* [虚]—the name of a village in present-day Shanxi) speak of how Mount Mao was once home to immortals and even had a marketplace, though they had long since departed. Later, when I asked Lord Bao about the mountain’s condition, he replied that the immortals still resided there and had not moved away. This mountain is the western gate of the Dongting Grotto-Heaven, connected to the Baoshan range within Lake Tai, which is why the immortals dwell within it. However, he mentioned only the Middle Immortal Lord by name, making no reference to his three brothers, nor distinguishing their seniority, nor noting that the Lord of Life holds a more exalted rank and governs separately in the Eastern Palace. As no records of this have been seen, it becomes clear that there are distinctions in rank and hierarchy.\n\nI now respectfully heed your instruction and amend my understanding accordingly. (The Prefect later added in another reply: “I have drafts of this letter preserved, which is why I was able to compile and record it. However, the opening section of the previous page is missing, so this does not begin at the original start.” Lord Bao was Bao Qingjian of Jurong, universally called “Bao.” By the time of this reply, he had already received the transmitted records—this was the beginning of the *yichou* year.)\n\nProceeding three or four *li* directly down from the mouth of Little A, one arrives at the Eastern Dark Gate of the Yin Palace. Entering two hundred paces into this cavern mouth, the interior becomes as bright as daylight. I wonder whether this distinct radiance of the grotto-heaven is drawn from the sunlight to illuminate the cave, or if it possesses its own luminosity. Within this grotto-heaven, the palaces and bureaus are vast, said to comprise hundreds of halls and chambers. The officials here include the two Immortal Lords, brothers, as well as other immortals—how many men and women reside within? Are these merely stone chambers, or are there also halls of gold and jade? Are the palaces connected to Dongting and Baoshan? Did Lord Bao and his sister, Lady Zhu, ever enter this palace while in the mortal world? Were the two of them not yet deemed worthy of ascension and thus appointed as subterranean lords? Where is their seat of governance?\n\nI, dull and ignorant, venture these questions, fearing they may give offense. (The matter of Lord Bao and his sister was not mentioned in the Middle Lord’s earlier letter; this must have been separately conveyed. Now, these questions are raised again, along with inquiries about the grotto, to which the *Dinglu* has provided further replies.)\n\nThe market’s stone platform and the name of the marketplace endure because of this. Today, I remain steadfast in my devotion to the Dao.\n\nGold and jade lie without intent—placed by the august spirit to further seal and secure. How could there be any violation of principle through excavation? This is merely a matter of insufficient scrutiny. To the left and right of the mountain flow spring waters, golden and jade-like essences, the very fluids of the land. Here, one may establish a quiet abode to conjoin the elixir. I shall bear this in mind. (The above responds to the question of residing by the Celestial Market’s springs, though no such abode has yet been established.)\n\nI remain uncertain: from which generation does the Dark Emperor descend? A later-born, benighted and slow, I am unequal to much. I humbly seek instruction. (The Jade Pivot’s Yu Shui Wang was styled the Dark Emperor; external records confirm this. The Prefect’s doubt arose from oversight. This query is addressed further below.)\n\nIn your letter, you mentioned that east of Mount Mao lies a small cavern—the hidden palace’s side gate. Entering the Dao there is somewhat easier. Later, one should gradually cultivate through fasting and seek it out. The numinous lineage extends its regard, and thus one may forge golden gates and ascend jade chambers. The difference lies only in swiftness or delay; I dare not tarry in regret. (Such guidance has been given, yet if one does not swiftly seek the reclusive journey, how can it not be lamentable?)\n\nSo too do the host of spirits earnestly urge and encourage—it is told that Great Mount Mao likewise has a small cavern on its southern face, nearly identical to the first, called the Southern Convenient Gate. Joyful to receive your awakening counsel, I delight in this virtuous instruction. With single-minded devotion, I shall purify myself and renew my resolve. Having learned of the auspicious day, I shall arrive in secret at the appointed time. Though my sincerity be humble, the numinous powers will surely witness and reflect it. (This is the eastern gate of the southern face of the Dao, resembling the small eastern gate of the hidden palace.)\n\nAs for the identity of Zuo Ci—these words of praise and exhortation, this gracious regard extended even to one so lowly, only deepen my admiration. (Earlier records also mention this matter.)\n\nIt is told that at the southwestern edge of Mount Liangchang lies a place fit for dwelling, once the separate residence of the Lord of Life and Death, where elixirs may also be compounded. As I have seen in the transmitted records, my heart secretly aspires to seek out the former abode of the Lord of Life and Death, a lofty retreat. Yet I fear I cannot ascertain it with certainty. Now I shall quietly assess and seek a suitable place, and when the time comes, I shall seek further guidance. (Earlier records also mention this. The foundations have long since crumbled, making exact knowledge difficult—hence this request for further instruction.)\n\nIt is further told that to the southeast of Mount Liangchang lies another dwelling place, marked by piled stones like a stove and a *jisheng* tree resembling a curved canopy. One should seek out this site when the time comes.\n\nIt is told that northwest of the cavern’s mouth lies a small, precarious, and unstable plot of land, where an outer meditation hut may be built. My original intent was to establish both inner and outer meditation huts, and I shall now carefully consider what is most fitting. (I have never heard of such an outer meditation hut being built before, yet now there stands a clearly visible altar of piled stones. Tradition holds that an official once vanished here in a transformation—whenever I visit and pay my respects, I am moved to sigh with lingering emotion.)\n\nIt is told that Mount Jun is most excellent. Before departing, the Lord of Life and Death buried gold there, which those who wish to ingest gold may retrieve. I myself have long harbored the intention to compound golden liquid, though I dare not yet pursue this. If I dwell on the mountain for years, advancing daily in cultivation and learning, then in time, if the matter may be undertaken in secret, I shall seek your counsel at the proper moment. (The Writ of the Middle Lord states: \"Before I departed, I buried gold,\" without specifying the Lord of Life and Death. The Prefect’s answer here is mistaken.)\n\nIt is told that on Great Mount Mao lies the bronze tripod of the Dark Emperor’s time, buried eight *chi* deep in the highest part of the mountain. This is an imperial site—□□□□□, the vessel left to instruct later generations. I am all the more grateful for this instruction, which may also serve as a place to establish a meditation hut. Deeply moved, I record this for my enlightenment.\n\nAs for the buried bronze and coins of the former Qu clan—this is entirely unrelated to our present purpose. Hearing of such distant matters, of eras long transformed, how can one not sigh with sorrow?\n\nWhen I first received your letter on the eighth day of the eighth month, I set out at once to the empty village (this was still the former hamlet) and stayed briefly with my family. Then, upon receiving a letter from home, I learned that the response was that I should not yet ascend the mountain. Thus I returned, delivering this letter only to the quietude of Zhu’s household.\n\nMy heart is coarse and my nature base; as a mere mortal, I am defiled and impure. My devotion is not earnest, and I lack the power to ascend.\n\nI have failed to grasp that my words have already reached your lofty attention. Having received your gracious examination, I find my words at odds with the matter—nothing remains but awe and trepidation.\n\n*(Prefect Xuanting’s every movement is thoroughly known; even the slightest of my words, once uttered, is promptly reported and met with a response. Perhaps this was conveyed by Master Yang. Xu Fan’s household still remains. The later reference to \"Xu Ou\" should indeed be \"Fan\" afterward. Thus I know the location of the well and residence—his ancestor was once a disciple of the Prefect.)*\n\nLong ago, I claimed the fields at Red Stone, which lie near the foot of the mountain and serve as a path for coming and going. This was my sincere intent. But soon after, a drought struck: the tenants reaped no harvest, and the embankment collapsed. Mu was then employed to oversee repairs, yet my strength has not sufficed to complete the task. It is not that I have abandoned the endeavor. Now that I dwell at the mountain’s base, I must resume cultivation. The distance from the cave’s entrance is the only reason I hesitate to settle there.\n\n*(These fields lie west of the Greater and Lesser Mao peaks, close to the great mountain. The view for gazing upward and paying reverence is excellent. Yet when I say the cave’s entrance is distant, I mean specifically the northern entrance. Though the fields are fed by the ravine’s waters, in times of drought the flow dwindles, and building an embankment is difficult. I do not know whether I will ever reclaim them. The embankment still breaches; repairing it would require hundreds of laborers, but could then irrigate ten or so qing of land. The disciples at the hermitage also sow and plant here as the water allows. I have long wished to restore this embankment, both to honor the legacy of the past and to bestow a boon upon the people.)*\n\nMy letters are crude and artless—how could I cease writing them? Yet the purpose of letters is to convey one’s intent. Since you have deigned to favor me with your regard, and I have personally paid homage before the Celestial Lords and the two Immortal Ones, my wish is divinely inspired, bathed in sacred grace. Why then should I trouble you further with letters? This is what is meant by \"having caught the fish, one forgets the trap.\"\n\n*(This is merely a pretext to avoid ceasing correspondence, offered as a rhetorical deflection.)*\n\n(In principle, this is most excellent.) I wonder where Lord Zuo is now. There is also Ge Xiaoxian, who likewise claimed to have attained the Dao. Where might he be now? Flesh-and-blood men are so fleeting—how I long to know.\n\n*(Ge being a fellow townsman, I thus inquire. This passage also has a reply later in the text.)*\n\nHere ends the reply from the Senior Archivist. All of this was written in his own hand, with many revisions, on white stationery, arranged in this order.\n\n*(Year yichou. This line was originally written on the back of the paper.)*\n\n*True Instructions, Scroll Eleven.*\n*True Instructions, Scroll Twelve.*\n*The Pivot of Spirit Verification, Second Chapter.*\n\nFormerly, I received your letters and saw your intent, which deeply illuminated my own aims. In an earlier letter, you wrote of traveling west to Wu in your declining years, awaiting old age, and sighing in the depths of night without anyone to consult. Yet where sincerity is felt, attainment is never far off. In your next letter, you spoke of long-held aspirations and past affinities, expressing your constant wish that the Perfected One might transmit essential instructions, that you might gaze upon his radiant countenance and personally receive his sublime teachings. But if diligence has not yet reached the highest realms, and refinement has not been broadly cultivated, the swift pursuit of true essentials cannot yet be anticipated. As the *Book of Later Han* says...\n\nHere begins the translation:\n\n---\n\nI was initiated into the mysteries at the Golden Portal of the Primal Register, transcending worldly traces and ascending to the pure void. How vast and distant is the mark of the mysterious! How deep and remote the abyss of wondrous caverns! To master oneself and purify the heart, to bathe in the fragrant streams—if one can achieve this, now is the time.\n\nYour last letter spoke of glimpsing essential principles and cultivating the Five Spirits. You claimed to have journeyed west to the gardens of *Menliang* and roamed east to the Mystic Isles, yet without striving to the utmost, seeking only to be guided and drawn forth. Such words, if truly rooted in the heart, may indeed open the way. The cultivation of the Five Spirits, too, has reached my ears. Yet the Dao drifts upon external traces, untouched by inner truth. Thus, the cloud chariot’s sacred shafts, though aligned, remain distant.\n\nIn ancient times, Zeng Shen and Hua Qiao (from this, we know Hua Qiao was once graced by the descent of the Perfected) responded to the summons of the age, for matters may arise unexpectedly. The waters need not be still; if one has the destiny but lacks the resolve, it is the very affliction Shen Gong lamented—meeting the ultimate yet failing to act, like spilled water that cannot be gathered again. Thus, the ancients said: *\"When the time comes, do not hesitate; the mountain recluse claps his hands in joy.\"*\n\nThose who study the Dao must not rely solely on their innate endowment but must preserve and uphold purity and wholeness. Then may they gallop toward the age of the pine, turn the wheel through the Purple Clarity, where the numinous vision resounds on all sides, and the mysterious tones harmonize in chorus. Jade chimes resound through the clouds, attuned without deliberation—this may be called the hidden treasure of the secret Dao, the supreme flourishing of true radiance.\n\nYou, Jian, have long held such aspirations; now I merely return to your former intent. (This letter appears to be Master Pei’s words, while Yang’s letter does not connect to the later questions of the Mystic Emperor. It may not be Master Zhong’s reply. Moreover, the original four letters of the Chief Clerk no longer survive.)\n\nAs for the Mystic Emperor: of old, the Yellow Emperor’s son, Changyi, wed the daughter of Mount Shu, and she bore Gaoyang, whose virtue was titled *Ruipian* and *Yupian*. *Ruipian*’s father dwelled in the land of Weak Waters, while *Yupian* himself was tempered at the ford of the Seven Rivers—this is the Mystic Emperor. Wielding the trust of the myriad spirits and overseeing the host of gods to guide all things, he commands the hundred qi, summons thunder and lightning. Thus, riding his chariot of primordial union, he journeyed north to Youling, south to Jiaozhi, west across the Flowing Sands, and east to the Coiling Tree. All beings, great and small, all gods within the light of sun and moon, were subject to him. Traversing the four directions and circling the eight extremities, wherever there were mountains of jade terraces or mounds of yin palaces, he transported the stones of Anxi to seal and fill them. Casting bronze from Mount Yu into precious tripods, he offered one each to the divine peaks of the Grotto Mountains—not merely Mount Juqu alone. This is the so-called Mystic Emperor.\n\n(What follows is Master Zhong’s reply to the four inquiries posed earlier, written on the blank space above. The account of *Ruipian* and *Yupian* aligns with the *Five Talismans*, except the latter omits the matter of burying the tripods.)\n\nBao *Qingjian* and his sister were both seventh-generation descendants of Li Zhan and Zhang Lü, originally from the northern village of Duling. They kept an inn at the Wei Bridge, accumulating hidden virtue and yearning for the Dao in hopes of transcending life.\n\n---\n\nThus did their blessings extend to Bao *Qingjian* and his kin, enabling them to undergo transformation through kalpas, to alter their surnames and renew their lives—united as brothers. Though their ancestral roots differed, the shade of virtue they shared was the same, and so they were destined to be born into the same clan. Now, both serve as lords of the underworld, dwelling within the Grotto Palace.\n\nWhat Bao *Qingjian* studied was originally shallow and meager, and his nature was further hindered by entanglements, so his attainment was not great. Should you wish to know the matter, it is thus: it resembles your own seventh-generation ancestor, Xu Zhao, styled Zi’a, who possessed the benevolence of rescuing the dying and the virtue of relieving the starving. Thus did his cloud-like shade flow to posterity, his hidden merit casting its blessing downward. It is for this reason that you now harbor a heart inclined toward the immortals and the perfected—this, too, arises from a cause. All things have their convergences of conditions; none attain them idly.\n\n(At the time of this writing, the Master’s instructions had not yet been transmitted, which is why the discussion touches upon Zi’a’s meritorious shade. Bao was also versed in the numinous, yet he esteemed the arts of the bedchamber, hence the term “entanglements.” Later, he employed the *Tai Xuan Yin Sheng Fu* of the Yin Lord as the method of Great Purity’s corpse-liberation—this must be the highest rank among the lords of the underworld. Thus do the threads of fate and affairs intertwine in this manner. As for the good and evil of people today, how could they be said to arise without cause?)\n\nAs for Ge Xuan: he was skilled in transformations and illusions but clumsy in the mastery of his own body. Now, he has merely attained undying life, not true immortality. Initially dwelling on Mount Chang, he later entered Gai Zhu. He could ride tigers and command ghosts, accomplishing all things, yet he nearly failed to receive his celestial office.\n\nThey were often accompanied by Xie Zhijian, Huang Ziyang, and Guo Shengzi.\n\n(Ge Xuan, styled Xiaoxian, was the paternal cousin of Ge Hong’s grandfather and the master of Zheng Siyuan. In his youth, he entered the mountains and attained immortality, yet none in his time could fathom his whereabouts. Legends spoke of an immortal in the Eastern Sea who sent him letters addressing him as \"Immortal Lord,\" and thus Ge Hong likewise referred to him as such. This is why the Prefect posed the question, and the answer given here identifies him merely as an earthbound immortal. As for the *Lingbao* scriptures’ mention of the \"Left Immortal Lord of the Great Ultimate,\" is this not an empty claim?)\n\nZu Ci now resides on Mount Xiao Kuo, frequently traveling to and fro and often appearing in these parts. He will soon receive his celestial office. Zu Ci’s complexion remains youthful, having gained the full benefit of the Nine-Splendor Elixir refined in the furnace.\n\n(Zu Ci, styled Yuanfang, was a disciple of Li Zhongfu and the master of Ge Xuan. When the Wei Emperor Cao Cao and his son summoned all the masters of esoteric arts, Zu Ci was among them. At the end of the Jian’an era, he crossed the Yangtze in search of mountains, eventually entering a grotto. There, he begged for cinnabar to compound the Nine-Splendor Elixir—a method recorded in the *Central Scripture of Great Purity*. Mount Xiao Kuo is Mount Xiao Kuocang, located north of Qiaoxi in Yongjia. All these figures are of this kind.)\n\nThe arts he mastered were many, yet his disciples who sought immortality remained inferior—all for failing to encounter the teachings of the Three Supreme Grades. This is why Master Xu sighed with such feeling.\n\nOn Mount Juqu, there are five gates. If one sets the mind, resolves the will, and observes pure abstinence for three months, then ascends to seek these gates, all may be attained at once. Attainment allows entry, yet people themselves fail to undertake the fast and the search.\n\nYou now ask to know the dimensions of the palaces, the number of men and women, and the count of those who preside over them. I shall explain these matters to you in turn. Your letter, too, seems overly exhaustive—why such diligence? Why such diligence? Moreover, one must first present a petition to the Director of Destinies. Only when the Director commands an answer regarding the intricacies of the palaces may I dare speak of them. These are, after all, the Director’s separate precincts; even I cannot claim to be the rightful master of the Terrace of the Washbasin.\n\n(Note: The subsequent discussion of various officials and figures is based on what was already presented to the Director of Destinies, thereby receiving full disclosure. Here ends the postscript to the *Record of the Determined*, answering the inquiries of the Prefectural Governor. Five additional entries follow, appended by Yang, sent from the Dark Emperor.)\n\nThe Eastern Minister-Director of Destinies oversees the host of perfected beings on Mount Tai, governing the myriad spirits of Wu and Yue. Truly, he may be called one whose Dao runs deep and whose virtue stands high, who subdues the multitudes of spirits. Jia Xuandao, Li Shusheng, Yan Chengsheng, and Chuan Daoliu—all once received the essential teachings of the Eastern Minister.\n\nXuandao was a native of Hedong, born at the close of King Wei of Zhou’s reign. Shusheng was a man of the commandery, born in the time of Emperor Yuan of Han. Daoliu was a native of Beidi and served as a general in the palace during Emperor Ling of Han’s reign. Chengsheng was a man of Wu who, in the time of Emperor Liu of Later Han, held the post of commandant of Wudang Commandery. All studied with utmost diligence and attained the true Dao. Now they reside in Xiaoyang Mountain, a branch of Mount Tai—these are what are called *earthly perfected*.\n\nThose who come to make trial of this path do not follow a single route. Some, too, may have transgressed through the faults of others. This is most difficult to resolve. In such moments, can one afford not to be cautious?\n\nThese four are subordinate to the Directors of Destiny, charged with examining those who come to test their study of the Dao. Thus, the Senior Scribe sent a letter to Jia, and Jia presented it to the Directors of Destiny, who likewise replied—all of which is recorded in the preceding scroll. These individuals hold minor ranks and are not prominent in external records. King Wei of Zhou should properly be identified as King Weilie of the Warring States period. Though the commandery of Hedong had not yet been established at that time, the name of the place already existed. The Han court had no official post of *Palace General*; it should likely be *Palace Gentleman-Commandant*.\n\nThis was received by the Perfected of Purple Yang on the twentieth day of the sixth month. The following entry was copied by an assistant. On the night of the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the Lord of Mao Peak received the letter and delivered it to Minister Xu (that is, the Senior Scribe, who is later to become the Left Minister of Supreme Clarity).\n\nProfound resonance gathers in stillness, and distant aspirations set the pattern. Their numinous radiance stands forth, twin principles naturally distinct. Surely they shall soar like the roc to the celestial vault, their cloud-fans stirring the spirit’s origin. Loftily they shall shake the jade towers, guiding the reins of the flowering perfected. Truly this may be called *advancing in marvelous form*, a sight beyond all comparison.\n\nHere, in the Palace of Cavernous Yin, within the Lower Terrace of the Inner Observatory, the wind stirs no jade-chime drums, and the grasses flow with no streams of gold or silver. Though before, when the light of the true luminants pooled and the five symbols turned in motion, it was but a side pavilion of the Bending Stream, a floating reflection of the Lesser Heavens—how could it be worthy of the profound concern of Your Excellency’s office? Yet you have deigned to turn the orchid-perfumed truth toward this humble place. Still, the mirror reflects without fail, and the round of contemplation must penetrate. Thus, matters beyond the ordinary are celebrated in song, and traces are as one. If sincerity is what you seek, I shall conceal nothing.\n\nPondering the radiance of Shan Jian’s layered brilliance, one may hope to reach the destined gathering. Even the luminous clarity of the wise is but attained through shared study. Let it not be that we, your humble servants, stand abashed in the shadow of such wind.\n\nThis alone is to be magnified.\n\n*(This reply was received a month after the previous letter, continuing the discussion of the desire to visit the Cavernous Palace. The phrase \"the radiance of Shan Jian’s layered brilliance\" seems to allude to the *Qinglu* text of the Wei tradition, though the names do not align. Since it was earlier stated that \"bowing to the profound and gazing upon the pure before the jade blade,\" this passage must carry another significance.)*\n\n---\n\nThe above passage is from Yang’s letter. Among the recorded officials of the Cavernous Palace, there are the Left and Right Administrators of Central Governance, corresponding to the modern offices of Chief Scribe and Marshal. There is also the Northern River Controller of Destiny, who oversees the Water Bureau’s assessments. This office typically oversees the Nine Palaces’ Forbidden Guardians. The Forbidden Guardians are responsible for guiding those destined to become the Seed People.\n\n*(Within the Cavernous Palace, below the Two Lords, these three offices are considered the highest.)*\n\nThe Left Administrator of Central Governance corresponds to the Grand Treasury’s Chief Scribe. Formerly, Han Chong held this position. Chong, styled Changji, was a native of Biling in Wu Commandery. From youth, he was devoted to the Dao. The immortal Wang Yu of Linwu Mountain once transmitted to him the method of the Flowing Pearl Elixir. Chong practiced it diligently, and it proved highly efficacious.\n\nWang Yu told him, \"By practicing this Way, you may also advance in official rank without hindering your ascent to immortality.\" Chong thus entered officialdom, gradually rising to become Magistrate of Wanling. He governed with benevolence and administered the people through the Dao. Tigers and wolves kept their distance, and locusts did not alight within his borders. Later, he was promoted to Governor of Runan, where he recognized the talent of his clerk, Yuan An. An would later rise to the position of Minister over the Masses. Contemporaries universally acknowledged Chong’s discernment in judging men.\n\nWhen Empress Yin was interred, the wives of the two-thousand-*shi* officials from the capital and neighboring commanderies were to gather at the imperial mausoleum. Yet Chong alone maintained a life of purity and simplicity. His wife, resentful, wept before him. An imperial edict inquired into the matter, and Minister of Ceremonies Feng Xi replied, \"Governor of Runan Han Chong embraces austerity and reveres the Dao, forgetting his own form. Though he holds high office, his wife spins and weaves herself. His governance is benevolent and unburdensome, treating the people as if they were wounded. Profound in wisdom and erudition, he possesses the discernment of a noble man—truly a luminary in the darkest night, a Zichan for Your Majesty. His wife, unaware of the virtue of frugality, weeps over her lack of fine clothing, which only serves to illuminate Chong’s illustrious power.\"\n\nThe Emperor marveled at this and increased Chong’s salary, raising his rank to that of a full two-thousand-*shi*. Later, when Emperor Xiaoming toured Runan, he visited Chong’s residence. Chong had sent his wife to stay with a solitary elderly woman. Upon hearing this, the Emperor sighed and said, \"Han Chong is one who remains uncorrupted even after a hundred refinings.\" He bestowed upon Chong fifty bolts of fine silk. Chong governed the commandery for fourteen years, and his transformative governance became widely renowned.\n\nAmong the finest under heaven, at the age of seventy-four, Yuwei Xuan then transmitted to him the method of hidden liberation. Thus he departed and entered Great Mount Huo, where he received from Yuwei Xuan the art of \"Disappearing Transformation through the Mud-Pill Purple Portal\" to transcend the world. Now he resides in the grotto as the Left Director of the Central Bureau.\n\n*(The* Han Shu *records similar events, though the wording differs slightly. Yuan An, styled Shaoping, initially served as a county functionary. Promoted through recommendation, he eventually rose to the rank of the Three Excellencies. He passed away during the reign of Emperor He and was the great-grandfather of Yuan Shao. In the Jin dynasty, there was also Feng Xi, who likewise served as Grand Master, their fame and rank being comparable. Since Han had achieved hidden liberation, this must have been a \"recorded\" [feigned] corpse. In present-day Jinling, atop the heights, stands Han’s tomb—a towering and immense mound, traditionally called \"Han’s Tomb.\" It is suspected to resemble the tomb of Peach Lord, or perhaps this is merely an empty barrow, though the world calls it the tomb of Sun Ce’s general, Han Dang.)*\n\nIt is said that Wang Yuwei Xuan was a Gentleman-in-Attendance during the reign of King Zhuang of Chu. He received his arts from Jade Lord.\n\n*(If this refers to King Zhuang of Chu from the Spring and Autumn period, the office of Gentleman-in-Attendance does not seem to match ancient posts, and the Han-era King of Chu did not bear the posthumous title \"Zhuang.\")*\n\nThe Left Director of the Central Bureau holds a position analogous to that of a Marshal. Now one Liu Yi, styled Zixiang, occupies the post. Originally from Yingchuan, Yi was devoted to the Dao and virtue from a young age, though his family was immensely wealthy. He often aided the destitute and troubled, delighting in performing hidden acts of virtue and secret kindness.\n\nWhen Zhang Jizha of Chenliu was traveling to mourn his teacher’s passing, his carriage broke down and his oxen were exhausted. Yi encountered him at the border of Runan. They spoke, but Yi did not reveal his name. Instead, he pushed the carriage and offered his own oxen for Zhang to ride. His acts of aiding the dead and rescuing the destitute were not limited to this one occasion.\n\nLater, Yi resided in Chang’an. He was recommended as a *jisuan* official and arrived at the capital. The Emperor, admiring his heart, appointed him Gentleman of the Palace and later promoted him to Governor of Chenliu. Within five hundred *li* of leaving Chang’an, he continued to gather the dead, succor the poor, diminish his own wealth to aid others, and practice virtue that reached even to Yangping. There, he encountered Master Ma Huang, who said to him: “Your benevolence has moved Heaven and Earth, and your hidden virtue has touched gods and spirits. The Supreme One is about to reward your sincerity. He has sent me to lead you to the Way of longevity. I am an immortal official. Are you willing to follow me?”\n\nYi then kowtowed and struck his breast, saying: “From my youth, I have cherished the pursuit of longevity. Now, by good fortune, I have met a divine immortal. I beg to serve and attend you.” Master Ma Huang then took Yi into Mount Tongbai, where he transmitted to him the Eight Arts of Concealing the Earth and the method of ingesting the essence of the Five Stars. He later bestowed upon him the name Donghua. Upon arriving in the grotto, Yi was appointed Left Director of the Central Bureau of the Register of Destiny.\n\n*(The* Book of Han *states: Yi, styled Zixiang, was a native of Yingyin. His family was immensely wealthy, and he was always generous in his aid, though he did not regard it as a personal favor. Once, while traveling in Runan, he encountered Zhang Jizha of Chenliu, who was hastening to his teacher’s funeral. Zhang had met with cold and ice, and his carriage had broken down, leaving him stranded on the road. Yi saw him and said: “You are diligent in fulfilling your duty to the end and hastening to righteousness—your journey should not be delayed.” He then dismounted, gave Zhang his carriage, and departed without revealing his name, urging his horse onward. Zhang suspected it was Yi. Later, when he deliberately passed through Yingyin to return the borrowed carriage, Yi shut his gates and declined to see him, pleading illness. He remained steadfast in his resolve, refusing all official summons.)*\n\nIn Henan, he was appointed as *gongcao* in Linjun. Later, when the Yellow Turban rebels rose, Yi provided relief to those in dire need, sustaining hundreds with food. When clansmen or villagers perished, he arranged their burials; when widows or widowers lacked means to marry, he aided their unions. When Emperor Xian relocated the capital to the Western Capital, Yi was recommended as *shangji yuan*. At the time, the roads were beset by bandits, so he traveled by night and hid by day, eventually reaching Chang’an. The emperor commended his loyalty and diligence, appointing him *yilang* and later promoting him to Prefect of Chenliu. Yi then distributed his treasures, keeping only his carriage and horses. Loading these, he set out eastward. Hundreds of *li* beyond the pass, he encountered a scholar-official who had fallen ill and died by the roadside. He exchanged his horse for a coffin and removed his own robes to shroud the body. Soon after, he came upon an old acquaintance starving and stranded on the road. Unable to bear leaving him, he slaughtered the ox pulling his carriage to feed him. Others urged him to stop, but Yi said: “To see the dying and not save them is no act of a man of resolve.” Thus, they perished together from hunger. These accounts differ only in minor details, so both are recorded here in full.\n\nYi, styled Zixiang, follows the pattern of matching given names with their meanings, for *xiang* (相) also signifies \"mutual.\" *Xiang* is pronounced *xiliang* (息亮切). It remains unclear which of the two is the correct interpretation.\n\nThe *Liexian Zhuan* by Ma Huang records that during the Yellow Emperor’s reign, there was a horse-master named Ma Shi. The *Dinglu Fu* lists a *Dianbing Zhifa Lang* (典柄执法郎), who was Chunyu Zhen, styled Shuxian, overseer of trials for those pursuing the Dao. Zhen was a native of Shangyu in Kuaiji. During the reign of Emperor Huan of Han, he served as magistrate of a county in Xuzhou, and later, during Emperor Ling’s reign, as an aide to the Grand General. From youth, he was devoted to the Dao, skilled in arts and calculations, and practiced the ingestion of sesame and *huangjing* (黄精). Later, he retreated into the Wu Mountains of Wumu to live in seclusion, where he encountered the immortal Huiche Zi, who transmitted to him the *Hongjing Dan Jing* (虹景丹经). Through cultivation, he attained the Dao and now resides in the grotto as *Dianbing Zhifa Lang*.\n\nThe *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* states: \"During Emperor Huan’s reign, Chunyu Shutong of Shangyu received arts from Xu Congshi of Qingzhou. Observing the celestial patterns, he divined disasters and anomalies, often with accurate results. Due to his mastery of these arts, the commandery recommended him as a *fangshi* (方士), and he was later promoted to Market Director of Luoyang.\" These accounts differ only in minor details.\n\nThere is no Wumu Mountain in Wu; however, both Lou and Wuxing have Tianmu Mountains, which may be the same. Huiche Zi does not appear prominently elsewhere.\n\nOn the night of the first day of the twelfth month, the *Dinglu Jun* (定录君) spoke of the Northern River Controller of Destiny, whose post had long been vacant and was temporarily filled by Tao Jun. Jun appeared to be a native of Qiantang. In his youth, he served as an administrative aide in the commandery, later carrying his satchel to the Imperial Academy to study. He was well-versed in classical arts, disasters, and anomalies. In his later years, he became Governor of Jiaozhi. At the end of the Han, he abandoned worldly life and entered Zengcheng Mountain to study the Dao. There, he encountered Dongguo Youping, a man from the Qin era who had long lived in seclusion in Zengcheng and attained the Dao. Youping taught Jun the arts of ingesting the Nine Essences, refining *qi*, and aligning the heart with the auxiliary stars. Jun cultivated these practices and achieved the Dao, now residing in the grotto.\n\nAs Northern River Controller of Destiny, he oversees the examination and punishment of the Water Office. Though this post falls under the jurisdiction of the Court of Fixed Records, it ultimately receives its directives from the Eastern Flowery Palace. Tao Jun, styled Wengzhong—(The *Book of Han* makes no mention of this; his tomb now lies at Linping in Qiantang, its mound and altar still distinct, his descendants yet remaining. Locals have at times heard the sounds of drums and horns near the site, so none dare encroach or damage it, all knowing it as the Tomb of Tao, Controller of Destiny. The recluse Du of Qiantang, who served Jing Chan, once composed poems with a fellow hermit in praise of his virtue; these are collected separately.)—Dongguo Youping likewise left no other notable traces.\n\nZhang Jizi was to become the Immortal Marquis of the Supreme Ultimate. Jizi was Zhang Feng of Henei, styled Gongxian. In his youth, he was known simply as Jizi. This man, too, gained renown early. The Grand Tutor Yuan Wei admired his lofty conduct and married his daughter to him. The daughter’s attire was extravagant and splendid, yet Feng regarded her no more than a stranger. Only after she changed her garments did they become husband and wife. Later, he abandoned the world and entered the mountains, where he encountered the Mountain Chart Noble Scion, a transcendent and former grandee of King Ai of Zhou. The Noble Scion taught Jizi the method of refining the Nine Cloud Waters and strengthening the *qi* through osmanthus refinement. Jizi cultivated this practice and attained the Dao, now residing in the Eastern Flowery Palace as an appointee of the Supreme Ultimate. He sometimes serves as Minister of the Nine Palaces, jointly managing water governance and examinations with the Northern River Marquis. The Northern River Controller of Destiny may also hold the title of Marquis of Prohibitive Protection, as their duties overlap. The Northern River Controller of Destiny likewise governs within a grotto-heaven, presiding in tandem with Zhang Jizi. (The *Book of Wei* states...)\n\nZhang Fan, styled Gongyi, was a native of Xiuwu in Henei. His grandfather [pronounced *qian*] served as Minister over the Masses in the Han, and his father, Yan, as Grand Commandant. Yuan Wei sought to marry his daughter to Fan, but Fan declined. Naturally serene and devoted to the Dao, he declined all summons to office. Later, he served as Gentleman Consultant and participated in the military affairs of Chancellor Wei Wu, earning profound respect. Fond of relieving the destitute, he kept no surplus wealth at home. He died in the seventeenth year of Jian’an.\n\nHis younger brother, Cheng, styled Gongxian, was also renowned. Appointed Gentleman Consultant for his upright conduct, he later served as Remonstrating Censor, Grandee of Zhao Commandery, and Prefect. He followed Wei Wu on a western campaign, falling ill and dying in Chang’an. The accounts of their names and styles vary greatly. Cheng and Feng appear similar but were not Yuan’s sons-in-law. If this were Fan, his style would differ. Upon close examination of their deeds, it seems more likely he was the elder brother.\n\nThe *Book of Wei*’s biography of Wang Xiu further states: Xiu frequently traveled to Nanyang, often lodging at Zhang Feng’s residence. When Feng’s entire household fell ill, Xiu tended to them. However, the Zhang brothers had once taken refuge in Yangzhou under Yuan Shu—never under Liu Biao—and thus should not have been in Nanyang. These inconsistencies cast doubt.\n\nThe Mountain Chart Noble Scion appears in the *Arrayed Transcendents’ Biographies*, as recounted by the Lady of Zhonghou. (Investigating the grotto affairs, all were described by these two lords. Yet in these two entries, only the Lady of Zhonghou is mentioned—likely because she was originally an official in the Eastern Flowery Palace.)\n\nI have heard from Dou Shi of the *Yi Qian*, who said: The Northern River Controller of Destiny, the Marquis of Prohibitive Protection, seems to have been modeled after someone. This must surely be the case.\n\n(This Dou clan refers to Qiongying. The phrase \"seems to have been modeled after someone\" likely points to the Prefectural Administrator. Thus, the Central Lord’s account states: the verification of the Northern River Controller of Destiny is confirmed. It is feared that after receiving higher teachings, she would no longer hold this position. Yet overseeing the seed-people accords with the role.)\n\nThe Protector of Destiny’s Office employs many female officials. Among the Three Offices’ staff, there are seven—four women and three men. The Seven Attending Gentlemen of the Bright Dawn serve in a capacity akin to the present-day Imperial Censor and Deputy Censor, all subordinate to the Eastern Flowery and Square Cauldron Palaces. The Protector of Destiny oversees them collectively. One of the Attending Gentlemen of the Bright Dawn, Zhou Yuanzi, was the daughter of Zhou Chang, former Prefect of the Han River South Commandery. Chang, a native of Ancheng in Runan, was devoted to hidden virtue, his merits imperceptible. Once, during a severe drought while serving as Prefect of the River South, he gathered and buried over ten thousand unclaimed remains of travelers who had perished beside Luoyang, erecting a charitable burial mound and offering sacrifices. Rain fell abundantly in due time, yielding a bountiful harvest. Many of his deeds were of this kind. The Supreme One, recognizing Chang’s hidden conduct, commanded Yuanzi to receive transformation in the Southern Palace and attain transcendence. She now resides in the grotto. Yuanzi, too, had loved the Dao from youth, consuming *fuling* for thirty years. Later, she encountered Shi Changsheng, who instructed her in the art of transformation and escape—transformation and escape being the highest form of liberation from the corpse. (Chang was the younger cousin of Zhou Jia. Of a kind and sincere disposition, he served as Prefect of the River South during the reign of a certain emperor.)\n\nIn the second year of *Yongchu*, a summer drought persisted, and despite prolonged prayers, no response came. Thereupon, (Chang) gathered and buried over ten thousand corpses, and timely rain fell in abundance. His rank later reached *Guanglu Xun*.\n\n*Mingchen Shilang* Zhang Taozhi was the mother of Zhu Yuyu, Han *Sili Xiaowei* of Pei. When Yuyu was executed alongside Chen Fan, his mother had long practiced hidden virtue. Upon hearing of her impending relocation, she was only then appointed *Shilang*.\n\n(Ju Yuyu was a native of Pei. Among the \"Eight Worthies\" of the *Huan-Ling* era, he was later implicated in the case of the partisans. Li Ying and Du Mi were both imprisoned and died, though not contemporaneous with Chen Fan.)\n\n*Mingchen Shilang* Xia Fu, styled Zizhi, was a native of Chenliu. From youth, he loved the Dao, consuming *zhu* and *er*, and harmonizing with *yunmu*. Later, he entered Mount Wu, where he received the *Lianhun* method from the Red-Bearded Master. He also encountered the True Man of Tongbai, who transmitted to him the *Huangshui Yunjiang* method. He attained the Dao and now resides in the grotto.\n\nIn his youth, Fu was summoned by the public office, yet he hung the summons on a mulberry tree and departed—such was his lofty and unyielding resolve.\n\n(Later Han records and the *Biographies of Lofty Recluses* both state: Xia Fu was a native of Yu in Chenliu. In his youth, he was a scholar. During Emperor Huan’s reign, he was recommended for his forthright speech but declined the post. Of upright character, he did not align with the partisans. Resented by the eunuchs, he was ensnared in the proscription of the partisans. To evade disaster, he cut his beard and hair, altered his appearance, and fled to the forests of Mount Linlü, where he worked as a laborer. Later, he returned home, shut his door, and refused to see anyone. He died before the partisan ban was lifted. The Red-Bearded Master appears in the *Liexian Zhuan*; Tongbai refers to the Right Assistant King.)\n\nThe remaining individuals cannot be recounted in full, but all were chosen for their steadfast integrity and uprightness, their embodied seclusion and spiritual clarity—qualities befitting a *Shilang*, regardless of gender.\n\n(As previously mentioned, there were seven in total; here, only two women and one man are described.)\n\nThe above was recounted by the Lord of Life-Preservation.\n\n(This likely follows the *Jie Zhonghou*’s announcement.)\n\nCommander of the *Tongchu* Prefecture, Liu Wenrao—Liu Kuan of Hongnong—loved the Dao from youth. He was once recommended as a *Han Fangzheng*.\n\nHaving been gradually promoted to Prefect of Nanyang, he regarded the people as his own children. His anger never showed on his face, nor did harsh words ever pass his lips. He practiced hidden virtue, rescuing the cold and destitute, so that the myriad people rejoiced and clung to him as to their own parents. Later, he became Minister of Education and Grand Commandant. The emperor bestowed wine upon him, but he prostrated himself and fell asleep. When the emperor inquired as to the reason, he replied: \"Your servant bears heavy responsibilities and grave duties, and I am constantly anxious as if drunk. This morning, I sent my servant to the market to buy vegetables. The servant stole the money to drink wine, and when evening came, he returned without vegetables. I lay down in the chamber, still without food. When I awoke, I cursed him as a dead dog. After scolding him, I immediately tied my sash and came to court, fearing the servant might take his own life afterward. This is why I was so preoccupied that I unknowingly fell asleep. I humbly beg your mercy and forgiveness.\"\n\nLiu Kuan’s heart was filled with benevolence and love, and all his actions were of this kind. At the age of seventy-three, he one day encountered the Master of Azure Valley, who descended into his bedchamber and bestowed upon him the method of the Staff of Release. He was about to depart for Mount Taihua, where he practiced the nine-breath qi-cultivation and was further instructed in the furnace-and-fire elixir formula. Through cultivation, he attained Daoist perfection.\n\nNow, he resides in the grotto as the Youthful Prime Marshal of the Upper Marquisate, overseeing those who first embark upon the study of the Dao.\n\n*(The* Hou Han Shu *states: Liu Kuan, styled Wenrao, was a native of Hongnong in Huayin. His father was named Qi. During the reign of Emperor Shun, he served as Minister over the Masses. Kuan was a man of prudence and sincerity. Once, a man who had lost his ox came to identify it among Kuan’s carriage oxen. Without a word, Kuan unyoked the ox and gave it to him, then walked home. Shortly after, a man of conscience found the ox and returned it. Overcome with shame and fear, the man was dismissed with thanks by Kuan. In the eighth year of Emperor Huan’s* Yanxi *era, he became Governor of Nanyang, where he consistently used whips of rushes. In the fifth year of Emperor Ling’s* Jiaping *era, he was appointed Grand Commandant. Once, while at the imperial seat, he dozed off drunk. The emperor asked, “Is the Grand Commandant drunk?” Kuan looked up and replied, “Your servant dares not be drunk. It is only that my burden is heavy and my responsibility great—my heart is as if drunk with worry.” Once, a guest arrived at Kuan’s home, and Kuan sent a servant to buy wine. The servant returned late and thoroughly drunk. The guest cursed him as a beast. Shortly after, Kuan sent someone to check on the servant, fearing he might take his own life. He said to his attendants, “This is a man, yet he was cursed as a beast—what greater humiliation could there be? This is why I feared for his life.” Later, he was enfeoffed as Marquis of Dai with six hundred households. He passed away in the second year of the* Zhongping *era at the age of sixty-six and was posthumously honored as General of Chariots and Cavalry. The court later bestowed the posthumous title* Zhaodao *Marquis. His son Song succeeded him. As this account differs in some respects, it is recorded here in detail. The Master of Azure Valley left no other notable traces. All these references to immortal teachings may belong to the lesser teachings’ limitations—otherwise, such discrepancies would not arise.)*\n\nThe affairs of Huayang will be further clarified later. Recorded on the twenty-third day of the first month.\n\nThe Venerable One of the Eastern Palace arrived to visit the grotto. At times, the Guest of Mount Gui would also gather with them—such were the days of grand assemblies of true immortals. How could one but briefly ascend to the realm of the Crouching Dragon to pay reverence at the sacred peak? It should be made known to Lord Xu. (This also appears to refer to the Middle Lord. As previously mentioned on the first day of the twelfth month, the Venerable One of the Eastern Palace is the Azure Lad, and the Guest of Mount Gui is the Queen Mother of the West. The earlier scroll also contains this instruction, bidding one to ascend the Crouching Dragon to gaze upon the mountain and perform obeisance—distinct from merely climbing a ridge. It is not necessarily a matter of proximity but rather what is fitting.)\n\nIn ancient times, there was a man who loved the Dao yet did not know the method of seeking it. He did nothing but bow and kneel morning and night before a withered tree, repeatedly pleading, \"Grant me long life.\" For twenty-eight years, he never wearied. One day, the withered tree suddenly burst into bloom, its flowers exuding a sap as sweet as honey. Someone instructed him to consume it, so he ate both the flowers and the sap. Upon finishing, he became an immortal. Such was the utmost sincerity of his devotion. If even a withered tree can produce purple blossoms and yield sweet nectar, how much more should the numinous terrace of the Three Radiant Ones and the Five Mushrooms’ abode respond to frequent reverence of the mountain peaks, washing away impurities? Truly, it is lamentable.\n\nThe reason worldly people so often fail to attain their desires is no different from why you fail to attain yours—how could it be otherwise?\n\nOnce, there was a man named Liu Shaoweng who frequently entered Mount Taihua, bowing in reverence toward the mountain. After twenty years of this, he suddenly beheld the Elder of the Western Peak, who bestowed upon him the Dao of immortality. (The *Prohibited Mountain Talismans* mentions the Lord of the Western Peak; it is unclear whether this Elder is the same.)\n\nAnother man would go to the riverbank every dawn to bow to the river. After ten years of this, the River Earl and the River Lord appeared to him, presenting him with ten pairs of white jade disks and teaching him the method of walking on water without drowning. This man later attained the Dao on the Central Peak. (The River Earl and the River Lord are likely two distinct deities.)\n\nWhen Zuo Ci first arrived, he too devoted himself to frequent bowing and reverence before the sacred mountains—for about five years.\n\nThus he attained profound advancement into the Eastern and Western Palaces of the Inner and Outer Courts. (Earlier it was said that entry came after three months—this differs greatly, perhaps because \"profound advancement\" is exceptional.)\n\nIn learning the Dao, one should be as steadfast as Shan Shiyuan, abandon worldly affairs like the Perfected One of Pristine Emptiness, and tread the deepest mysteries as did Zhou Ziyang. How could one fail to attain the Dao? (The *Traditions of Shiyuan* have not been transmitted. His renunciation of family to seek learning is recorded in the *Apocrypha*; he was a disciple of Yin Gongdu and later became the Perfected One of Mount Taihe. The Venerable Lord of Pristine Emptiness and Lord Zhou of Purple Yang each have their own hagiographies.)\n\nOne’s resolve must be steadfast and diligent; one’s spirit must be refined and empty. All actions and undertakings must be kept discreet. (The *Precepts of the Azure Lad* states: \"In learning the Dao, one must be diligent and discreet. Diligence means unceasing effort day and night; discretion means that none but oneself knows.\" The Central Lord reiterates this—truly the ultimate admonition, a single phrase that encompasses all.)\n\nThe above was dictated by Lord Dinglu for transcription. (This passage also appears in Yang’s writings.)\n\nAs for gazing toward the forest—does one not yearn for those who have already transcended, as one admires that disciple bathing in radiance? It may be said: \"Before your eyes, yet suddenly behind.\" (The wife of the Prefect has already transcended; now the Prefect gazes toward the forest peaks—how could he be without longing? Once he deemed himself her superior, yet now he lags behind. This is likely an exhortation meant to spur him on.)\n\nThe above was spoken by the Lady of the Southern Peak.\n\nZhang Jiangzi was a native of Xizhou and the younger sister of Zhang Ji. (Ji was a general under Dong Zhuo at the end of the Later Han, later a commander from Xiliang. He died in battle while attacking Rangcheng, struck by an arrow. He was the paternal uncle of Zhang Xiu. His sister’s marriage is not recorded in external sources, and it is unknown whether she was wed.)\n\nLi Huigu was a native of Qi and the wife of Xiahou Xuan. (Xuan lived at the end of the Wei dynasty and was executed along with Li Feng by Sima Zhao. It is unknown whether his wife died before or after him. Li Feng was from Fengyi, not Qi—it is unclear whose daughter this Li was.)\n\nShi Shunü was a native of Shanyang and the daughter of Shi Ji. (Shi Ji was from Wuxing. During the reign of Sun Hao, he served as General of the Cavalry and defended Xiling. Here it is said he was from Shanyang.)\n\nFearing that the daughter might have married out and taken her husband’s commandery as her designation—or else this would be discordant—Zheng Tiansheng was the mother of {Dengyi} Zhi. ({Dengyi} Zhi, styled Bomiao, was a native of Xinye in Nanyang. In Shu, he served as Liu Shan’s General of Chariots and Cavalry. Later, while traveling, he saw a {chongyuan} carrying its young and shot it dead. Stricken with remorse, he died. It is unknown whose daughter his mother was.)\n\nThese several women of former times were famed for their benevolent conduct and virtuous reputation, and all now dwell within the grotto. In the grotto are the Hall of Yiqian and the Terrace of Han Zhen—both names of palaces. It is reckoned that they now reside in the eastern chamber of the Hall of Yiqian. In this hall there are altogether eighty-three persons. There is also the Lady of Xiechen, a daughter of the Nine Palaces. The Supreme One once sent her to teach these methods, all of which preserve life and confer scriptures. The Lady of Xiechen oversees their instruction.\n\nThe Lady was Huang Jinghua, daughter of Huang Qiong, the Han Minister over the Masses. Han Zhong transmitted to her the cinnabar of Mount Min, and by ingesting it she attained transcendence. (Huang Qiong was a native of Jiangxia, styled Shiying. During the reign of Emperor Shun of Han, he served as Minister over the Masses, Minister of Works, and Grand Commandant. He died at the age of seventy-nine. His father, Huang Xiang, during the reign of Emperor Zhang of Han, was President of the Imperial Secretariat and saved over a thousand lives.)\n\nLady Jinghua’s son, Yuwan, served as Minister of Education and Grand Commandant. He was killed by Li Quan. The Lady herself had not yet married at the time. Among these persons here, some are called \"ladies,\" some \"wives,\" and some \"mothers\"—each name is chosen for its clarity, not necessarily because it reflects the merit or blessings they confer.\n\nThe Hall of Embracing Perfection is where women who have already attained the Dao reside, subordinate to the Eastern Palace of the Supreme Primordium. There are nearly two hundred of them. (The eighty-three persons mentioned earlier reside only in the Lodge of Easy Transitions. Since the Hall of Embracing Perfection is of higher rank, one must be promoted and transferred to enter it.) These two palaces are exclusively for women. There are also the Palace of Youthful Beginnings and the Hall of Leisurely Repose, where male disciples study. (The names of these men and women will appear later; these are merely abbreviated designations of the most eminent.)\n\nAmong those with whom she resides, she is closest to the mother of Bo Miao. Others are also on good terms with her. (The mother of Bo Miao is the Lady of Zheng.) She prepares a bed to await the spirits, a longing most sincere in filial children. She has already brought benefit to her son.\n\nEarlier, when I gave you that cup and cloth, it was merely a gift between us—something exchanged when I was about to enter the grotto-chamber. The regulations of the immortal officials forbid revealing the truth, so I had to disguise it as another favor. This, too, was an expression of deepest intent. She also wished to prepare a bed for repose, so that the refined *qi* of the departed might have a place to dwell. Keep this confidential. Her son’s Dao is like this.\n\n*(This is an instruction to the clerk. The matters here all have their intended significance and cannot be openly annotated. From the Office of the Record-Keeper, there are thirty-one entries in total, accompanied by one volume of clerkly transcriptions and annotations.)*\n\n*True Reports, Scroll Twelve. True Reports, Scroll Thirteen. The Pivot of Spirit Verification, Part Three.*\n\nAmong the rulers of the underworld, there are three ranks. Among the titles of ghostly marshals, there are likewise three ranks. All these are bestowed upon those who have accumulated merit and virtue in the world, whose deeds have ripened into fruition—whether through personal pursuit of longevity and attainment of the Dao, or through the virtuous conduct of descendants that glorifies their ancestors, or through recitation of the *Dongxuan* scriptures, whose transforming influence extends to ancestors seven generations prior. *(The *Dongxuan* refers to the *Great Dongxuan Scripture*; reciting it ten thousand times enables the refinement of the bodily essence in the Southern Palace for ancestors from the seventh generation onward, allowing them to receive the transformation into embryonic immortals. This is not the *Dongxuan Lingbao Scripture* as commonly referred to in the present age.)*\n\nThe paths to seeking transcendence are not singular, and the means of attaining it are manifold. In essence, it is through the accumulation of hidden deeds in the world that all may achieve this vast renewal of life. Ghostly marshals undergo martial liberation, while the rulers of the underworld undergo civil liberation—both are the beginnings of immortality. Their names are recorded in the Eastern Flower Registry, selected and inscribed by the Celestial Emperor, and they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Three Officials’ bureaus.\n\n*(It is also said elsewhere: Those who diligently attend to their duties while desiring to savor the purity of the Dao, or who outwardly conform to worldly customs while inwardly fearing death and yearning for immortality, may also become civil or martial liberation rulers.)*\n\nThe lowest rank of underworld rulers resides scattered in external dwellings, idly abiding without fixed duties.\n\nThose not subject to the teachings and regulations of the Nine Palaces, nor engaged in the practices of refinement and transformation, though dwelling within the grotto-heavens, are the lowest among these rulers. According to the Siming method, this rank requires one hundred and forty years before qualifying for a single promotion. Only upon this first promotion may one ascend the immortal ranks and receive the commands of the immortals.\n\n*(According to the Sword Classic, the rulers possess extensive hierarchies and promotion timelines, with vast disparities in duration. The numerical designations of these ranks differ from their titles, where greater numbers confer higher status—such is the structure of their hierarchy.)*\n\nThe second rank of underworld rulers may directly embark upon the immortal path, ascending through the immortal grades. After one hundred and forty years, they are promoted to fill the positions of the *Guanjin* (Custodial Offices), which resemble the scattered clerks of the mundane world. This rank represents the middle tier among underworld rulers. Li Dong and others currently belong to the first rank.\n\n*(Li Dong, a native of Qu’e, served as a household leader and libationer. His original documents still exist, and he followed the methods of Bao of Nanhai. Though Li Dong’s talents were mediocre, his heart and conduct were pure and upright, thus qualifying him as the lowest among the rulers’ attendants—one whom the Xu family regularly employed. In the first year of Yongchang, when the Master was twenty-three, he received from Li Dong the Six Jia Yin-Yang Traveling Kitchen Talismans. Since this account is closely related, it is briefly mentioned here.)*\n\nThe third rank comprises the highest of the underworld rulers. They may freely enter and exit the halls and chambers of the immortals, roaming the lands of the divine provinces. They are assigned to the *Tongchu* and *Erfu* lodges, and upon entering, they attend the Eastern Flower Upper Terrace. There, they study the transformation of form, bathe in luminous essence, and refine their qi. After twelve years, their qi gathers the spirit-soul; after fifteen years, their spirit binds the corporeal soul. After thirty years, the bones within the coffin reattach to their spirit and qi. After forty years, they are restored as living beings and return to wander among mortals. After fifty years, they are appointed to immortal offices. After sixty years, they may roam the Broad Cold Palace. After a hundred years, they enter the Palace of Kunying—such are the highest of the rulers, the leisurely attendants of the immortals.\n\nZhang Jiangzi and others were previously among the second rank, having only just gained entry to the *Yiqian* lodge. The hierarchy of ghost marshals follows this same order. (The ranks of the *zhuzhe* are not restricted by gender. According to these time limits, once the bones within the coffin are obtained, they may be reborn into the world—such cases do occur, though their transformations and concealments are difficult to fathom, verging on the inconceivable.)\n\nThe *Yiqian* and *Tongchu* lodges are the halls and chambers for both men and women. Within them, all is tranquil. The Green Lad of the Eastern Sea visits twice a year to inspect these palaces and observe their inhabitants. (The phrase \"twice a year\" seems to follow the transmitted records, though earlier texts state: \"On the twenty-third day of the first month, the Superior One of the Eastern Palace arrives\"—suggesting no fixed schedule.)\n\nZhao Sutai has resided in the *Yiqian* lodge for four hundred years and refuses to leave, claiming there is no greater joy in the world than this place. Zhao Sutai was the daughter of Zhao Xi, a Han-dynasty Inspector of Youzhou. She rescued the destitute from the rivers, saved Wang Hui and others from extermination, and performed dozens of hidden acts of virtue. Thus, her person was permitted to ascend to the Vermilion Mound, and her children now dwell within the Grotto Heavens. Xi frequently enters and exits the Bureau of Fixed Records, while Sutai often roams the paths and lanes in plain attire, finding contentment in the mountains and marshes. (Zhao Xi is not prominently recorded in the *Book of Han*. Her \"roaming in plain attire\" likely refers to her sojourns within the Grotto Heavens, not the mortal world.)\n\nAmong those in the *Yiqian* lodge, some are of lofty attainment yet live in quiet obscurity, such as Dou Qiongying and Han Taihua.\n\nLiu Chunlong, Wang Jinxian, Li Xizi, and Guo Shuxiang—these several individuals all possessed a celestial disposition of profound refinement, their bearing loftily transcendent, their talents rivaling the finest, their demeanor striking awe in the multitudes. These were the foremost among the masters, the most capable of the immortal officials. Next in rank were those such as Zhang Shanzi.\n\nLady Miaomu of Dengyi was renowned for her virtuous conduct, and thus later generations often revered and emulated her. Dou Qiongying was the younger sister of Dou Wu. Her seventh-generation ancestor, a man named Zhi, made it his vocation to gather abandoned bones and his calling to revive the dead. Thus, his blessings extended to Qiongying’s own lifetime.\n\n(Dou Wu, styled Youping, was the great-grandson of Dou Rong. Zhi was likely Rong’s grandfather. Wu, too, was ever generous, scattering his wealth to relieve the destitute throughout the realm. During the reign of Emperor Ling, he served as Grand General but was executed alongside Chen Fan. When his mother gave birth to Wu, she also bore a serpent, which slithered away at once to the southern mountains. It returned only when she passed, and then vanished again.)\n\nShe wept bitterly for a long while before departing—this too was deemed extraordinary. Yet it remains unclear why both brother and sister should inherit the blessings of seven generations: the brother executed while the sister attained transcendence—this cannot be the Northern Dipper of the Daoist tradition. The ghostly bureaucracy has its own Northern Dipper Lord, who governs life and death.\n\n(According to records, when Sun Hao’s defeated general Zhang Ti’s soldier Liu Rong fell ill and died, after three days he suddenly rose with a great cry, saying, “I reached the gates of the Northern Dipper, where I saw men binding Zhang Ti.” Startled, he faltered, and that very evening, Zhang Ti perished in battle. This would seem to correspond to the Fourth Palace. As for the Fifth and Sixth Palaces, whose domains remain obscure, they may well be the courts of judgment and retribution.)\n\nThe Supreme Emperor of the ghostly bureaucracy is the Northern Emperor, who presides over the First Heavenly Palace and governs all Six Heavenly Palaces. The remaining four palaces are each administered by the Four Luminous Lords.\n\n(Though each is said to govern one palace, their specific locations are not clearly defined. Since the palaces stand in parallel, they cannot be assigned to the four cardinal directions. Examining the hierarchy of the Lords, the Second Palace is governed by the Western Luminous Lord, the Third by the Eastern Luminous Lord, and the Fourth by the Northern Dipper Lord, with the remaining two following in sequence.)\n\nEach pair of heavenly palaces is overseen by one official, making three officials in total across the six heavens—akin to the offices of penal law, responsible for judgment and punishment. These are perpetually overseen by true immortals and the Lords of Life, who collectively govern them and share the duty of administering life and death. All major decrees and judgments issue from the immortal officials.\n\n(This is the \"Three Officials\" often invoked in Daoist tradition. The *Scripture on Dispelling Demons* states that Mount Tai has a Left Fire Official, a Right Water Official, and a Female Official, also called the Three Officials, all charged with punishment. Today, the Three Mao Lords oversee them: the Great Lord as commander, and the Lord of Life as inspector. Their subordination to the immortal officials stems from the fact that not all people in the world die; some attain true transcendence and thus fall outside the Northern Emperor’s jurisdiction. Others, though dead, may undergo spiritual transformation and regain form—such cases are recorded by the true immortals. Hence, the office of the Lord of Life governs and unifies these matters.)\n\nThe Northern Dipper Lord of the ghostly bureaucracy serves as the examining official for the Daoist Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper. This ghostly office is also subordinate to the essence of the Nine Stars and ultimately answers to the Jade Lord of the Northern Dawn.\n\n(The Northern Dipper in the heavens has its own overseers, so the ghostly bureaucracy mirrors this with a corresponding office. Its authority derives from the *Jade Rotating Square* and the *Jade Tablet*, thus it is ultimately subordinate to the courts of the Most High.)\n\n... [text missing] ... need not all come directly. I shall reveal to you one or two secrets, fellow kindred spirits, so you may know the tranquility of the Dipper’s hidden realm. How can one not be diligent in the Dao?\n\n(These three individuals are not mentioned in other texts. During the Later Han, there was a Li Yun, who also served as Magistrate of Baima and was executed for his forthright remonstrance. The phrase \"fellow kindred spirits\" refers to his address to the Chief Clerk and his subordinates.)\n\nOn the night of the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month, the Lord of Life delivered this message.\n\n(According to earlier records, though the Chief Clerk, Sima, and others were informed by the Register of Destiny, this appears to be the initial account of the grotto’s affairs, dated the eleventh month of the *chou* year. The present mixed account, however, should follow later and is instead dated the seventh month, though it does not correspond to the *yin* year. The sequence is difficult to reconcile. Fourteen entries in total were received from the subterranean authorities, transcribed by clerks into a single scroll.)\n\nThe Cavern of Embracing Reality exists within all grotto-heavens, not only here. This particular cavern belongs to the Supreme Prime Prefecture and is subordinate to the Lord of Life. Within it, two female transcendents preside: one is Zhang Weizi, daughter of Zhang Qing, Grand Minister of Works during the reign of Emperor Zhao of Han. Weizi was devoted to the Dao and, having mastered the method of corpse-liberation, entered this realm.\n\nShe had previously resided in the Grotto of Easy Transitions. Weizi regularly ingested mist-qi, claiming that mist-qi is the essence of mountains, marshes, water, and fire—the fullness of qi within metals and stones. Prolonged ingestion allows one to disperse the form and enter emptiness, merging the body with cloud-qi. Weizi stated that she received this method from Chun Wenqi, the Jade Consort of Eastern Florescence in the Eastern Sea, who is the younger sister of the Azure Lad. Once, Weizi concentrated her thoughts in secluded stillness, her sincere heart moving the numinous, and so Wenqi descended to her. She transmitted the Dao of ingesting mist.\n\nAfter receiving the Dao of mist-ingestion, Weizi also taught it at times to those studying in the Grotto of Embracing Reality and the Grotto of Easy Transitions. I once obtained this formula, which is excellent and practical. The method of ingesting mist is as follows:\n\nAt dawn, in a state of secluded stillness, sit or lie as you wish. First, close your eyes and inwardly visualize, faintly perceiving the five viscera. Then exhale through the mouth twenty-four times. Do this while keeping the eyes closed, so that you see the five-colored qi swirling and coiling around your face in a dense cloud. Next, inhale this five-colored qi through the mouth fifty times. Afterward, swallow saliva sixty times. Then softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Great radiance emits brilliance,\nNuminous mist shifts on all sides.\nBound qi coils and bends,\nFive colors fill the grotto-heaven.\nDivine smoke converges and opens,\nMetals and stones bloom with true essence.\nLush and deep, the purple void,\nRefining form to preserve wholeness.\nEmerging in light, hidden in seclusion,\nFive spirits transform and divide.\nUnited brightness fans the emptiness,\nAt times riding the six clouds.\nHarmonizing and gathering my body,\nAscending to the nine heavens.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, knock the teeth together seven times and swallow saliva seven times. Then open your eyes, and the practice is complete. This Dao is wondrously efficacious. Many in the Mystic Capital of the Divine Continent have mastered this art. Can you practice this method? With long practice, you will often ride clouds and mist in your travels.\n\n*(This method of ingesting mist has been transcribed separately for use.)*\n\nThe account is found in the third scroll. (It remains here in doubt, accompanying the main text.) One such true woman was Fu Lihe. Lihe was the daughter of Attendant-in-Ordinary Fu Jian, nephew of Emperor Huan of the Han, from Beidi. Her family devoutly practiced Buddhism with diligence. The daughter daily swept and purified the space before the Buddha, offering earnest prayers and vows, her heart set on transcendence. The divine spirits, observing her resolve, allowed her to come here. After long residence and gradual transformation, she has only now become the Mistress of the Terrace of Embracing the True. She attained the Dao by ingesting the qi of the Five Stars. Lihe was skilled in song; when she sang, birds and beasts would gather in flight to listen.\n\nThe Lord of the Register of Destinies spoke thus. (The accounts of Zhang and Fu are not prominent in external records; they may each be found in their family genealogies.)\n\nAnother entry records Yang Shu, transcribed by Yuan. Wang Yan served as President of the Secretariat under Emperor Wu of Jin. His daughter, styled Jinxian, became the consort of Crown Prince Minhuai. When Luoyang fell into chaos, Liu Yao and Shi Le abducted Jinxian. As they crossed the Mengjin Ford of the Yellow River, intending to take her as wife, Jinxian cursed them, saying: “I am the wife of the imperial heir, daughter of the Minister of Education. How dare you, barbarian dogs, presume to violate me?” With these words, she leapt into the river.\n\nThe maidservant, named Liuchu, then declared, “If the great may do so, the small should do likewise,” and likewise leapt into the river.\n\nAt that moment, the female immortal Han Xihua of Mount Songgao was traveling and took pity on them. She embraced and rescued the two, allowing them to receive inner salvation while outwardly appearing dead. Their bodies were secretly preserved, and she then took them into Mount Songgao. Today, they reside within the Hua Yang Palace Grotto, in the realm of *Yi Qian*.\n\nLiuchu was then about twenty-two or twenty-three years of age. Her form and countenance were also refined, and she possessed a steadfast heart and integrity. Her original surname was Tian, and she hailed from Yuyang. She was the granddaughter of Tian Feng, former magistrate of Junyi during the Wei dynasty. Feng had once performed deeds of hidden virtue, which extended to Liuchu.\n\n(*The* Jin History *states: Wang Yan’s eldest daughter was named Jingfeng, of great beauty. Empress Jia arranged for her younger brother, Mi, to marry her. His youngest daughter, named Huifeng, was wed to Crown Prince Minhuai, whom he resented. Thus, she was not particularly favored. In the sixth month of the fifth year of Yongjia, Wang Mi, Liu Yao, and Shi Le sacked Luoyang. When the bandits sought to force themselves upon the consort, she drew a blade and declared, “I am the daughter of the Grand Commandant and consort of the imperial heir. I would rather die than suffer humiliation at the hands of traitorous barbarians.” She was then killed. Her family later interred her northwest of Luoyang, north of the Luo River, and she was posthumously enfeoffed as Consort Zhen Ding. This account differs slightly from the above.*)\n\nFan Youchong was a native of Liaoxi. Having conceived through transformation and altered his form, he now dwells here.\n\nHe constantly ingests the Three Qi. The method of the Three Qi involves visualizing the blue qi, white qi, and red qi, each like {a thread extending}, descending from the sun in the east and entering directly into the mouth. {The hands press} ninety times. Once satiated, one stops. Practicing this for ten years, the three-colored qi naturally reside within the body, and one thereby attains transcendence as a divine immortal. This is the High Lord Yuan’s *Method of the Primal Inner Radiance* from the *Great Simplicity*. Perform it daily at dawn, conducting it with eyes closed. Gazing at the sun is also beneficial. Though the method is rarely transmitted, its effects are profoundly verified. Lord Xu may practice it. (This method was also transcribed in a duplicate text, found in the third chapter under \"Cultivation Practices.\")\n\nFan the Overseer is this very person. Formerly, he served as the Youthful Overseer of the Beginning; now he resides in Huayang. (Elsewhere it is said he once served as a Han dynasty Palace Attendant and was skilled in geomancy, taking grave sites and dwellings as his focus. This is also recorded in the third chapter.)\n\nThe three entries above are all from Yang’s writings.\n\nLi Zheng of Henei formerly received the *Method of Guarding the One* and the *Cavern Chamber* and attained the Dao. Initially dwelling on Mount Luoyang, he has recently entered Huayang. He also oversees matters of examining and exorcising malevolent influences among the people. Zheng once served as tutor to the Duke of Changdao Township. When he received the Dao and entered the mountains, he was already sixty years of age. (It is unclear what office Li held; he likely served in an overseer’s post. The Duke of Changdao Township was Emperor Yuan of Wei’s original enfeoffment.)\n\nTo the northeast of {Wangzheng} Mountain lies a cave that connects to the southern cave of Fang Mountain in the great Juqu region. Jiang Bozhen frequently ascended this mountain to gather *shinao*. The *shinao* lies beneath the northern cave of Fang Mountain. Master Fanyang also once gathered and ingested it. ({Wangzheng} Mountain is still part of the Great Horizontal Mountain. As later stated, “The aide constantly traveled with five individuals from Fang Mountain.” However, it is unknown whether a path leads into the grotto-heaven.)\n\nMaster Fanyang is He Miao of the Deer Track Cavern. This substance is also found in the northern Zhushan. (The location of Zhushan is unclear. North of Juqu, west of Deer Track Mountain, there is a place called Zhujiao Mountain, which is likely the site.)\n\n*Shinao* resembles stone but is slightly speckled in color and {coarse and large}. It is found in many places. One may ingest it.\n\nAt times, it causes one to feel heat. It also prevents thirst. Li Zheng, before entering the mountains, suffered from wind-bi illness, which took a long time to heal. This man had previously indulged excessively in bedroom affairs, so his illness then was not as mild as it is now. (Nowadays, *shinao* is also found east of Great Mao Peak. Its form is round and small, resembling *zengqing* but with a texture like stalactite beds. Its lower part is bright white, occasionally marked with black specks, and it is {coarse and large}. Ingesting it generates heat, and its therapeutic effects resemble those of stalactites.)\n\nIn the Great Huo Mountains of Luojiang, there is a Terrace of Flowers, where five-colored concealed *zhi* grow. (This is the domain governed by the Southern Perfected and the Deity of Fate.) The Huayang Cavern also harbors five kinds of night-glowing *zhi*. (These are the *zhi* that the Deity of Fate requested to cultivate within and beyond Juqu.)\n\nLiangchang Mountain bears {tomb-fire} fire *zhi*. This substance appears on the ground like {tomb-fire}, though its essence resembles grass rather than being so. It is as large as a bean, with purple blossoms, and emits light when viewed at night. Consuming one piece brightens one aperture in the heart; eating seven pieces brightens seven apertures, enabling one to write at night. It is calculated that consuming forty-seven pieces grants a lifespan of ten thousand years. (To date, no one has reportedly encountered it.)\n\n(For this is merely a matter of failing to seek with utmost sincerity.) Within Baoshan Mountain grows white *zhi*. There is also the water of Hidden Spring, a true purple in hue. (This is Mount Linwu, situated in the great Wu lake.)\n\nOn Huayang’s Mount Leiping lies the Field Lord’s Spring. Drinking its waters expels the three worms from the abdomen, and its flavor matches that of Hidden Spring. It is said to be the flowing essence of jade-sand. Used to launder clothes, it requires no lye—this being its singular marvel. (This water now wells up from the earth, resembling boiling water in appearance, yet its taste is surpassingly fine. When used to wash soiled garments, they become clean at once. This is the place now called Willow Vale, located roughly one *li* southeast of the Prefect’s residence.)\n\nIn the time of Gao Xin, there was an immortal named Master Zhan of the Upper Rank who planted plums upon the Earth of Crouching Dragons, filling the land with them. Master Zhan now serves as the Right Guardian of the Nine Palaces. He often tells others: “In former days, while dwelling beneath Huayang, I ate white plums of extraordinary sweetness. The memory lingers still, yet in an instant three thousand years have passed.” (Various chronologies record that from the first year of Yao’s reign—*wuxu*—to the *jimao* year of the Qi dynasty, 2,803 years elapsed. Gao Xin was Yao’s father, so this statement must date to the Jin era. To speak of three thousand years when only 2,800 have passed since Yao’s time suggests that external calendars may be imprecise. For instance, the *dinghai* count would already have been exceeded. The *Bamboo Annals* record a precise span of 2,643 years—an even greater discrepancy.)\n\nLater, Guo Sichao planted the Five Fruits in that same place. The land is also suitable for cultivating *mu-shi*—the *mu-shi* of Blessed Land, used to dispel calamities and the myriad ills. During the Qin, the Daoist Zhou Taibin and Jiang Shumao, the Marquis of Baling, came to reside beneath Mount Juqu. They also planted the Five Fruits and the Five Pungent Vegetables. Shumao was enfeoffed as marquis during the reign of King Xiao of Qin. The place is now named Jiangba after him, for the land took its name from Shumao. (The name remains to this day. A great road runs from behind Small Mao Peak to Yanling, and is called Jiangba Road. However, during the reign of Duke Xiao of Qin, the state had not yet annexed Chu to establish commanderies, and Baling County was only founded in the early Jin. It is unclear how there could have been a marquisate of Baling—likely it refers to the Ba of Bashu.)\n\nBoth men attained immortality and now serve as Left Ministers on Penglai. The various Jiangs of Nanzheng are descendants of Shumao. Shumao once wrote to the officials of the Supreme Ultimate Palace, saying: “Formerly, I studied the Dao in Guigu, attained it in Shaoshi, nurtured my *ge-yu* in Huayang, and awaited ascension in the Realm of Leisure. At times, I rode the whirlwind-chariot, feasting in Juqu. I awoke to the swift passage of time, how things endure while people perish—what toil is this?” Taibin was also a man of talent and skill, adept at playing the zither. He once taught Mi Changsheng and Sun Guangtian. Guangtian was none other than Sun Deng, who could play eight notes on a single string—a truly marvelous feat. (Sun Deng is the same “long-whistler” mentioned by Xi Kang of Mount Kuaiji, who also spoke of seeing him play the one-stringed zither. These words are not empty.)\n\nShumao cultivated the Five Pungent Vegetables and often sold them to purchase cinnabar for his use. Even now, among the mountains, leeks and scallions remain—perhaps his lingering seeds. (The place is now called Leek Mountain, west of Great Mao Peak, where large leeks grow in abundance. Garlic and scallions also appear elsewhere, not solely in Jiangba.)\n\nBefore the present dwelling lies a pond, constructed by Guo Sichao. He raised its embankments so the water would be deep. Yet over the long ages, the pond walls have crumbled. (The present dwelling seems to refer to the Prefect’s residence. Before it lies a pond, with a dike to the west—this dams the waters of Willow Brook. Yet it is far from Guoqian, which lies northwest of the Northern Grotto. There is a large reservoir there, where Sichao likely once resided. The meaning of “before the dwelling” is unclear; perhaps the Prefect established fields there. Further details may follow.)\n\nSichao often sailed a small boat upon the pond, striking the hull and singing:\n*“A clear pool girds the numinous peak,*\n*Long forests lush with verdant green.*\n*The dark bird hides in secluded wilds—*\n*In leisurely words, I speak my mind.*\n*I ply my oars upon the sacred waves,*\n*Bowing my head to seek the Morning Wind.*\n*Yet the hour of liberation eludes me,*\n*And I wander free among these hills and groves.”*\n\n*(The “Morning Wind” refers to the wind of the Jade Dawn of Supreme Purity, not the bird of that name in the *Mao Odes*.)*\n\n*“Beyond the Nine Abysses, the waves surge with gods,*\n*I refine the Dao and attain the Golden Perfected.*\n*This is the feather of the numinous phoenix.”*\n\n“Conceal my radiant dragon scales,\nLift high this inch of heart-matter.\nTen thousand breaths are but dust and grime—\nPity the morning-born mayfly’s grace.\nWho can exhaust your chariot wheels?\n*(Feminine favor does not outlast the mat,\nMasculine love does not wear out the wheels—\nThe mayfly lives but a morning,\nAn image of man’s fleeting world,\nSo easily dissolved.)*\n\nRoaming the void, I shed the whirlwind,\nMy spirit steps trace no fixed form.\nThe spherical light blazes with bright auroras,\nNine phoenixes sing to the morning sun,\nTheir radiant plumes fan the River of Heaven.\nAuspicious clouds soar in billowing flight,\nAnd I arrive at the Great Tenuity’s halls,\n*(I sip this golden nectar,)*\nWandering beyond the Dark Abyss.\nNeither existing nor ceasing to exist.\n*(The Dark Abyss and Nine Abysses lie beyond the Eight Extremities,\nAtop the peaks of the Nine Auroras.\nAscending the Wood Star,\nAlso called the Dark Radiance’s Eastern Sun Abyss—\nThus Ruoshi told Lu Ao:\n‘I and Hanman have our tryst above the Nine Abysses.’)*\n\nI ride the fiery chariot, dancing through Divine Empyrean,\nClad in auroras, girded with the nine suns,\nPeerless as the High Emperor’s dragon wheels.”\n\nThus I arrive at the Northern Florescence Chamber,\nWhere divine tigers roam through jade groves.\nWind and clouds merge as one,\nOpening and closing the gates of dark mystery.\nSpirit-transformations erase all traces of the profound.\n*(In the Four Courts, he served as Jade Terrace Canopy-Bearer,\nHence the saying: ‘Peerless as the High Emperor’s dragon wheels.’)*\n\nThe *Dinglu* states:\n*(The preceding twelve clauses were transcribed as one scroll.)*\n\nOf the Four Courts, he was a man of Yan State.\nFour brothers all attained the Dao—\nFour Courts was the eldest.\nIn truth, his dharma governed the Three Offices,\nSix hundred years without transgression.\nSeated, he transcended and ascended.\nWhen Four Courts’ term ended,\nHe was promoted to Left Immortal Duke of the Nine Palaces,\nOverseeing the Jade Terrace Canopy-Bearers.\nFor long the post lay vacant, unfilled,\nUntil Sihe succeeded Four Courts.\n\nThe villagers below the mountain\nStill call a level marshland “Guo Qian,”\nPreserving Four Courts’ surname in common speech.\nFour Courts once sent men to cultivate this land,\nAnd year after year, whenever he traveled,\nHe would pass by this mountain\nTo visit Sihe,\nWandering and gazing over the plains and hills.\n*(This is recorded in the Mao Tradition.\nAccording to such accounts...)*\n\nThe place called Guo Qian was merely where cultivation took place—it was not his residence. His dwelling must have been the estate of the Prefectural Scribe. Now that the embankments and walls have collapsed and water no longer pools deeply, people treat the land as fields. Yet the terrain remains low and expansive; even slight damming still forms a pond, allowing one to row a boat and sing. But none can trace the footsteps of that distant age—how lamentable!\n\nLater accounts say that Four Courts passed by each year to wander and gaze, for even after his promotion, he still cherished his former home, often feasting in the Eternal Realm and gazing fondly upon his old companions.\n\nZhang Xuanbin, a man of Dingxiang, was nominated as a Filial and Incorrupt Candidate during the reign of Emperor Wu of Wei. Returning to his hometown, he served as disciple to Ji of Xihe, consuming medicinal herbs and practicing the arts of the Cavern Chamber and White Prime. Later, he encountered the Perfected One Fan Ziming on Shaoshi Mountain, who transmitted to him the Dao of vanishing transformation and concealed radiance. Formerly on Mount Tianzhu, he now resides in the Hua Yang Grotto as the Warden of Prohibitions. The Warden of Prohibitions oversees the offices of waters and rains.\n\nThis man excels in discoursing on emptiness and nothingness. Scholars of discourse often uphold the principle of fundamental nonbeing, saying: Nonbeing is the dwelling of Great Being; from it, Lesser Being arises. Accumulating Lesser Being nourishes Lesser Nonbeing; perceiving Great Being reveals the root of Great Nonbeing. Being contains Nonbeing, and Nonbeing contains Being.\n\nThus, my eyes see no things, and things likewise do not see the absence. By lodging in Being, Nonbeing is accomplished; by lodging in Nonbeing, Nonbeing is attained. Here, Nonbeing has no dwelling—even the Great Void is but the dwelling of Nonbeing. Before I was born, the world knew no Nonbeing. Such is the foundation of his discourse.\n\nThe numinous ones of Tongbai could not refute him. He himself claimed: \"Formerly, I visited Song Chensheng of Penglai. Chensheng was the Left Duke of Penglai. When I discoursed with him on Nonbeing, he roughly grasped my meaning. Beyond this, he still could not fathom the root of Being—how then could he fathom the root of Nonbeing? When I discuss emptiness and nothingness with others, none in the world can match me.\"\n\nSuch is the loftiness of his qi and the firmness of his principle that even Dongqing Jun, Ziwei Xuanqing, could not contend with him. The Warden of Prohibitions also serves as the Regent of Life-Preservation. (This discourse on the principle of emptiness and nothingness uniquely attains the school of Nonbeing, yet its profound subtlety resists exhaustive scrutiny. Even among Perfected Ones, talent and understanding vary greatly. Dongqing of Tongbai and Ziwei Xuanqing are esteemed as the most eloquent debaters—hence they are cited as standards. According to the *Zuozhuan*, the heir apparent of a lord is called *fujun* when accompanying him and *jianguo* when acting as regent. The role of *jianguo* is that of a deputy; thus, this \"Regent\" may derive from *jiansi*.)\n\nZhao Weibo was a native of Dongjun. In his youth, he studied under Master Zhang of Handan, who was a man who had attained the Dao.\n\nIn his later years, he resided at Mount Song, where he transmitted the *Jade Pendant and Golden Bell Scripture* to Fan Qiulin. Qiulin was the wife of Wei Xingdao, the Han dynasty General of the Tower Ships. Having studied the Dao and attained immortality, she then imparted to Xingdao the Way of the Sun and Moon. She also ingested the *Ninefold Radiant Mirror Flower*, thereby achieving transcendence. Formerly, she had come to reside within Huayang, serving as Vice-Minister of Life-Preservation. The *River Chart* states: \"In Wu and Chu, many have witnessed the Great Peace.\" She would often tell others: \"These words are not empty; this verification will soon come to pass.\" (How can such scholars not redouble their diligence and effort?)\n\nThe preservation of the *Luminous Mirror* is no ordinary worldly method. According to the oral instructions received from Fan Qiulin: \"Master the art of whistling. Let your whistling resemble the mingled cries of a hundred birds, or the wind surging through a forest, or the sound of drums being struck.\" Once, at the Altar of the Celestial Market, she faced north with fervor and let forth a long whistle to summon the wind. In an instant, clouds gathered above, and surging qi stirred the forest. At times, dark mists converged in a whirlwind; at others, a fine rain descended in a mist.\n\nThe Ministry of Life-Preservation has four Vice-Ministers. This woman oversees torrential rains and waters, as well as the governance of the *Five Mushrooms of Gold and Jade* and the *Herbs of Metal and Stone*. Should one wish to summon a great deluge, one may present a petition to her. (The Warden of Prohibitions also governs rain and water; if seeking rain, one should petition both together.)\n\nOne of the Vice-Ministers was Le Changzhi of Xianyang, a fellow townsman of the Eastern Minister of Destiny. He was recommended for office by the Lesser Lord and served as Gentleman of the Palace during the reign of Emperor Huan of Han. In his later years, he followed Master Li of Mount Song in studying the Dao, practicing the *Sevenfold Primordial Method* and attaining immortality. (Though more than two hundred years had passed, he still enjoyed the grace of the Minister’s favor.)\n\nAnother was Zheng Zhizheng, an inner-chamber disciple of Master Meng. He was appointed by Master Meng. (Master Meng was a native of Jingzhao.)\n\nOne may also address him as Master Meng, though his name and rank remain unknown. Another was Tang Fang of the Western Mountains. (This is the figure recorded in *Accounts of Divine Transcendents*—a native of Shu who served Li Babai.) Le Changzhi oversaw calamities and disasters; Zheng Zhizheng was in charge of examinations and annotations; Lord Tang Fang governed life and death; and Zhao Weibo kept the registers of immortals. Together, they recorded the names of Dao cultivators and oversaw the manifestation of torrential rains, numinous mushrooms, and sacred herbs. (The officials of the Cavern Palace supervise and inspect the people of Wu and Yue, though no more than these four Vice-Ministers hold office. Below them are the Four Masters, whose affairs are detailed in the third scroll.)\n\nHere the *Register of Destinies* concludes. (To the right of this passage, a note in brush and ink refers to the preceding section, though a gap appears here—likely due to a later excision. It is feared that other matters may have been lost as well, a cause for deep regret.)\n\nDu 〈*qi*〉 [Guangping] was a native of Duling in Jingzhao. At the beginning of the Jian’an era, he crossed the Yangtze to the east and entered Kuaiji under Sun Ce’s patronage, accompanying him for a time. Later, he served Sun Quan as Commandant of Establishing Trust. In the second year of Huangwu, he gradually turned to the study of the Dao.\n\nHe encountered Master Jie {Yuyan}, who transmitted to him the arts of *xuan* and *bai*. Thereafter, he withdrew to the eastern slopes of Great Mount Mao, where he dwelt in seclusion. Those who mastered the *xuan* and *bai* techniques could conceal their forms, and he was often seen appearing in the markets and villages. Du 〈*qi*〉 [{Guidaida}] and Xu Zongdu, along with Yan Xiansheng, formed a trio who together resided within Mount Mao. At times, they entered its grottoes, or gathered herbs and firewood, trading them in Xuqu for clothing and provisions—unnoticed by others.\n\nNow, {Yuyan} was a disciple of the White Ram Master and presently dwells in Mount Fang in Jian’an. (According to the *Talisman of the Forbidden Mountain*, {Yuyan} was slain by Sun Quan but transformed his form and departed, journeying to Mount Fang in Jian’an to seek the White Ram Master. It was likely at this time that Du received the Dao.)\n\nThe pronunciation of 〈*qi*〉 [{Guidaida}] is *Xue*, identical to that of Shun’s minister. The character 〈*qi*〉 [{}] consists of four strokes, while *qi* (契) has three, differing in their regional variants.\n\nXu Zongdu was a native of Jinling and served as Left Chief Military Clerk under Sun Hao, with Lü Ti as his commander. He received the *qi*-restraining arts from Master Fenggu, which is how he came to associate with 〈*qi*〉 [{Guidaida}]. Yan Xiansheng was the nephew of Bu Zhi and a disciple of Zongdu. 〈*qi*〉 [{Guidaida}] had two disciples: one was Hanhua, the granddaughter of Sun Ben. In her youth, she secretly formed an attachment with 〈*qi*〉 [{Guidaida}], later studying the Dao and receiving the methods of Jie {Yuyan}, which she in turn transmitted to Hanhua.\n\nWhen Hanhua first departed, she initially fled to Jian’an and took refuge with Zhang Yi, the magistrate of Shaowu. Yi was a close relative of 〈*qi*〉 [{Guidaida}], which allowed her to escape unharmed. Once the situation stabilized, she returned to Mount Mao.\n\nHanhua practiced the Mysterious-White Method and maintained a measure of restraint. Even now, they sometimes lived together. The Mysterious-White Dao forbids sexual relations, yet from the time she received the Dao from 〈*qi*〉 [{Guidaida}], she was unable to engage in such conduct. (Sun Ben, Governor of Yuzhang under Wu, had a son, and Wangsun Xi of Shanyin had a son named Hanhua. Investigating these two, one finds they initially indulged in licentiousness without restraint, but upon entering the Dao and applying their resolve, they were able to restrain and sever such impulses. This is why they were deemed worthy of transmission. Ben was a cousin of Sun Quan through the same paternal line and had four sons, each named Lin, An, Xi, and Shu, though none were named Xi—perhaps this was a childhood name, or Xi may have been a royal surname.) Her younger brother’s only son was Chen Shijing. During the reign of Sun Xiu, Shijing served as Gentleman of the Palace and from youth was fond of the Dao. He frequently visited Buddhist temples and was a townsman of 〈*qi*〉 [{Guidaida}], which is why in later years he too received the methods. When 〈*qi*〉 [{Guidaida}] first brought Hanhua to Jian’an, Shijing accompanied them on the journey, and in truth, it was he who facilitated their secret plans.\n\nThese several individuals now dwell beyond Mount Mao, not as regular cave-dwelling guests. They occasionally enter [the mountain] and often visit the residences of the Prefectural Administrator for leisure. Yet they mostly remain among the Great Mao peaks. (From the beginning of Jian’an to the enthronement of Sun Xiu spans sixty-two years. When Du first followed Sun Ce, he was scarcely twenty; thus, by the time of his flight, he would have been over eighty. This cannot be so.) Shijing now ingests *zhu* and *zexie*, while Hanhua consumes nothing. (Mount Mao has no stone chambers, so they must have built huts. Since they take medicinal preparations, they require drug implements and still rely on clothing and provisions. They cannot be entirely secluded; rather, at that time, the forests were dense and secluded, with no one tracing their footsteps.)\n\nThey practiced the Way of Guarding the Mysterious and White, often sitting or lying at will. Within the *niwan* [mud-pill palace] was black *qi*; within the heart-mind was white *qi*; within the navel was yellow *qi*. The three *qi* together arose like clouds, covering the body. Thereupon, they transformed into fire, which encircled the body. The body became pervasively luminous, internally and externally as one. They cultivated this from dawn until midday, then ceased.\n\nThus, they performed the qi-ingestion one hundred and twenty times in total, completing the practice. The Dao is precisely thus—enabling one to attain longevity and immortality, warding off all harm. This is called \"knowing the white and guarding the black,\" whereby death cannot be sought; \"knowing the black and guarding the white,\" whereby all evil dissipates. They strictly avoided the meat of the six livestock and the five pungent vegetables. One should sleep separately and meditate in stillness, with particular aversion to sexual intercourse—engaging in it leads to death. This Way resembles the practice of Guarding the One, though it is a more direct and essential method, with even greater strictness regarding sexual abstinence. The prohibition in Guarding the One merely requires moderation. Initially, the stored qi emerges like a small bean, gradually expanding to pierce the heavens. The three qi intertwine like smoke, coiling around the body, merging into a single primordial chaos. Suddenly, fire arises within the threefold smoke, combining with the radiance to refine the entire body. Within the body, the five viscera become luminously transparent. This, too, is an essential Way.\n\nThese several individuals have already lived over three hundred years, owing precisely to the power of the Mysterious and White. They are all practitioners of the undying arts, though they have yet to attain the full Dao of immortality. *(The matters of the Mysterious and White have already been transcribed in detail in the third chapter on cultivation practices. Calculating from Du’s age of around twenty during the early Jian’an era to the third year of Xingning in the Jin dynasty, he has reached one hundred and ninety years.)*\n\nThese individuals began their studies late in life, yet this states they have all lived over three hundred years—perhaps the character \"three\" is an exaggeration, and \"two\" would be more plausible. For those who wish to practice the Mysterious and White, they should follow its scripture, which is but a brief text. It can be practiced alongside other methods to dispel the ten thousand evils and repel the thousand harms. After thirty years of practice, one may conceal the body and hide the form, traveling five hundred *li* in a day. (This Way is also called the *Fetal Essence Central Radiance Mysterious and White Method*.)\n\nOn the night of the fourteenth day of the eighth month, the Immortal Lord of Preserving Life spoke. (This transmission was surely meant for Ya, though it may have been a test to tease the Prefect.) Ya, in your practice of *guarding the One*, have you not yet risen from your separate chamber? (This discourse concerns the matters of the Mysterious and White and *guarding the One*. Suddenly recalling the *yin* beast, for the *yin* beast has yet to abstain from the bedchamber—hence this mention.)\n\nStill radiance veils the vast forest,\nDim dawn ascends the eastern clouds.\nMorning winds dance through sixfold smoke,\nLush and dense, the eightfold Dao surges.\nWhy must the Five Peaks alone be fair?\nNamed mountains, too, suffice to climb.\nWith outstretched hand, I grasp the cavern mounds,\nMy heart nests in hidden revival.\nExhaling and inhaling fetal essence,\nWho can surpass the Mysterious and White?\n\nThe above was often chanted in song by Du Guangping. Now recorded here for clarity.\nThe above was transmitted by the Perfected Lord of the *Dinglu*.\n\n(This should likewise correspond to the fourteenth-night discourse. From Du came nine passages, all transcribed by clerks, forming a single composition.)\n\nTowering, towering—Mount Cen’s peaks,\nFragrant the secluded crags and ridges.\nLofty, lofty—the Master,\nRiding harmony, comes soaring.\nHair unbound, brow at ease,\nHe tills the slopes himself.\nThree meals suffice,\nNo need for packed provisions.\nJade traces gleam in the east,\nPhoenix echoes resound in the west.\nDukes and marquises summon him—\nHe rides the wind, robes billowing.\nDwelling, he makes no boast;\nEmerging, he seeks no fame.\nClad in coarse cloth, he moves with leisure,\nStaff in hand, he strides freely.\n\n(This composition bears a different hand’s script, appended after the preceding poem, followed again by the matter of the secluded *bib* gate. Since the authentic text concludes with the prior piece—already marked as complete—this poem cannot be Du’s work, nor is its author known.)\n\nThe recently designated quiet abode lies here—\nThis is the innermost chamber of Jinxiang.\nWere it not for Magistrate Xu and his sons,\nWho could dwell here?\nIn later generations, only a worthy child of virtue\nShall reside in this land.\nYou, his descendants, keep this secret—\nDo not lightly disclose it.\n\nHere must be the very site where Magistrate Xu later built his dwelling. The land of Jinling is vast, yet this is its most excellent tract—only true immortals may reside here, and thus only the magistrate’s clerk could dwell in it. The \"worthy child of virtue\" remains unfathomable: he may bear the surname Chi, or be a great man, or one of the heroic worthies destined to rise in future times, who shall again come to live here. Since this concerns the affairs of later descendants, it is not fitting to speak of it prematurely. Moreover, this land bears profound fortune, and one must not broadcast it widely, lest others recklessly occupy it and bring defilement.\n\nThe dwelling Magistrate Xu now builds faces east toward a small mountain called Mount Leiping. In the Zhou era, the Lei clan raised dragons here. Later, Jiang Shumao the Field Elder also lived on this mountain. To its north flows Willow Water, also called Elder Tian’s Spring, for the man once dwelt on this mountain and drew from these waters.\n\n(Mount Leiping lies north of Little Mao Peak, its foundations adjoining. Elder Tian’s Spring still exists today. Willow trees grow thickly on either side, hence the name Willow Water. This spring is the very one earlier described as \"washing clothes without ashes.\" Since the magistrate’s residence fell into ruin, no one has known its location.)\n\nBy the early Song dynasty, Lady Tan, the Princess Dowager of Jing of Changsha, sponsored a Daoist surnamed Chen and established a Daoist residence northwest of Mount Leiping—this is the present Northern Residence. Later, there was Mount Jurong, and Wang Wenqing, as recorded in the annals, became its master. Learning that Magistrate Xu had once built his dwelling here, he extensively consulted the village elders. In the seventh year of the Daming reign, an elderly adept named Xu Ou mentioned that his ancestor had served Magistrate Xu and passed down knowledge that the magistrate’s residence lay just before the present residence, where the tallow trees stood, and that the well before the refectory hall likely remained. At the time, the site was overgrown with weeds and brambles. Wang then cleared the vegetation and searched, indeed discovering a brick well, its mouth nearly filled with earth. He excavated and repaired it, reinforcing it with tiles. Now it holds fine water, slightly white in hue, perhaps the very water earlier described as resembling that outside Phoenix Gate.\n\nThus confirming it as the former residence, which had long lain abandoned, with none daring to dwell there. Since it was said to be the \"golden chamber to the inner room,\" it must have been the most fertile ground for crouching dragons. To its northwest stretches a long ridge, called Mount Long Concealment.\n\nNortheast of Mount Leiping lies another mountain, commonly called Great Horizontal Mountain, though its true name is Mount Yu Ridge. The *Records of Famous Mountains* refers to it as Ridge Mountain. At its foot flows a spring where Li Ming once compounded the elixir of immortality and ascended to the Mystic Continent. The site by the water remains to this day. Due east of this mountain stands the ancient tomb of King Yeyi of Yue. (Originally written as *墓*, later generations changed it to *冢*. The mountain now extends far and wide. The later reference to an ancient immortal compounding the elixir likely refers to this place. Li Ming merely stated it lay in a certain region, so it may have been slightly south of here. No foundation traces remain by the water, perhaps gradually reclaimed by overgrowth.)\n\nKing Yeyi was the fourth-generation descendant of Goujian. Initially refusing to ascend the throne, he fled into a cave on Mount Jing. The people of Yue lured him out, and later, during the Wu dynasty, he was relocated back to Kuaiji. In the eleventh year of King Xuan of Zhou, he was killed by Sun Zhujiu, who was in turn slain by the people of Yue. How his tomb came to be so far away remains unknown—perhaps there was some numinous quality to this place. Though no definitive burial mound has been found, there appears to be a designated funerary precinct.\n\nThe above was spoken by the Lord of the *Dinglu*.\n\n(The following three entries were transcribed by an assistant.)\n\nThe jade inscription of Huayang lies west of Tongchu Prefecture, facing east—or, as some say, on all four sides. Its text reads:\n\nLoosening the sash, donning coarse cloth,\nOne seeks the principles of life and livelihood.\nNurturing and preserving the Three Also,\nPenetrating my jade scripture.\nGoverning the Eight Elders,\nAnd the Twenty-Four Perfected.\nSleepless, gazing inward,\nSubtle qi flows ceaselessly—grasping and recording the Great Simplicity.\nMysterious, yet again mysterious,\nThe spirit Dao exists in the present.\nWhen the disciple arrives, then shall it be attained.\n\n*Yi Qian* says: The Lady of *Dengyi* spoke these words to him. To unravel this is to attain immortality—these are the essential words of transcendence. *Yi Qian* did not comprehend them; perhaps the Marquis of Xu can elucidate them.\n\n(*Yi Qian* was the wife of the Prefectural Clerk. The Lady of *Dengyi* was the mother of *Dengyi* Zhi. This inscription is only roughly comprehensible—all pertains to the higher Dao. Yet the later lines are obscure and cannot be fully understood, hence the request for the Clerk’s interpretation. Or perhaps it was merely a playful test.)\n\nThe above entry was transcribed by So-and-so.\n\nThe recluse now resides in peace before the *Zhaoling* Terrace. He wishes to erect a small stone stele and inscribe upon it the *Fifteen Eulogies of Huayang*, all in praise of the events within and beyond this mountain grotto, so as to manifest sincerity to the numinous precinct and perpetuate it for distant ages.\n\nYet the stele has not been carved with *distinctive force*. For now, its text is recorded here as follows:\n\n**The River Chapter** traces the records of the past;\n**The Annals of Kong** illumine the names of old.\nThrice lodged, they adorn the celestial order;\nTwice metallous, they mark the earth’s glory.\n*Right: Pivot of the Realm.*\n\nThe dwelling arises from non-being to being;\nIn being, it returns once more to emptiness.\nThe numinous structure needs no craftsman—\nIts void-form achieves success of itself.\n*Right: Essence and Image.*\n\nThe spirits gather in the Three Treasuries;\nTheir paths diverge yet join the Five Conveniences.\nYin’s radiance greets the night’s brightness;\nDawn’s essence gazes upon the morning’s hanging.\n*Right: Form and Position.*\n\nThe southern peak towers like a dark tripod;\nThe northern ridge stretches like Qin’s jade disk.\nWithin and without, the Jade-Sand Ford;\nAll around, hidden wheel-tracks.\n*Right: Mark and Permeation.*\n\nTo the left, it is girdled by Willow Water;\nTo the right, it is scoured by the Yangvalley Stream.\nThe soil bears the hue of *Beiyang*;\nThe well is pure with Phoenix-Gate Spring.\n*Right: Regional Distinctions.*\n\nGuo’s thousand peaks stand as flowing banks;\nJiang and Ba stretch across distant traces.\nTemple visages may at times receive offerings;\nSeparate dwellings ever maintain reverence.\n*Right: Traces and Designations.*\n\nWu’s dwellers knew not this land;\nYue’s clansmen, *great in speech*, concealed their migrations.\nTree canopies cast only fleeting shade;\nStone hearths have never known smoke.\n*Right: Analogous Attachments.*\n\nFruit groves luxuriate in dense *mumu* trees;\nVegetable gardens trail lingering bitterness.\n*Ying* mushrooms may illumine the night;\nField springs ever wash away dust.\n*Right: Patterns of Things.*\n\nDismounting reins at Tortoise Mountain’s guest;\nUnbridling steeds before the Azure-Flower Lad.\nIn repose and feasting, the Hall of Embracing Reality;\nIn lofty gatherings, the Palace of Leisurely Ease.\n*Right: Wanderings and Assemblies.*\n\nClear songs soar with feathered flocks;\nLong whistles return with tumbling clouds.\nA lone string holds transcendent melodies;\nEmpty discourse admits no contention.\n*Right: Talents and Heroes.*\n\nThe marked abode lies below Thunder Flat;\nThe standing stillness joins Stone Shade.\nThe higher Dao has already stilled thought;\nSoaring blossoms align with the heart’s axle.\n*Right: Learning’s Endowment.*\n\nRoaming the jade blade of Square Corner;\nDwelling in reclusion at Huayang.\nIf the Double Brilliance should chance to resemble,\nThe Seven Origins will then support one another.\n*Right: Profound Correspondence.*\n\nThe numbered cycle is nearing completion;\nThe *Hai* count has not yet ended in *Ding*.\nThus inheriting the Tang era,\nThey shall attend as guests at the Sage’s court.\n*Right: Germination of Opportunity.*\n\nHaving crossed the spiritual, there is a place to be;\nGoing or staying follows what is fitting.\nHow could numinous traces be manifest or hidden?\nThe dark paths know one another of themselves.\n*Right: Course of Karmic Destiny.*\n\nCarving stone above the Dark Window;\nDisplaying sincerity at the Winding Stair Gate.\nIn movement and stillness, one attends with solemn record—\nNot betraying the grace of protection and recommendation.\n*Right: Sincere Aspiration.*\n\n*Right: These fifteen poems each bear two characters below, encapsulating the intent of their respective chapters. Every character within the poems carries meaning and purpose. Later readers may seek their significance within the text itself.*\n\n*Declarations of Perfected, Scroll Thirteen.*\n*Declarations of Perfected, Scroll Fourteen.*\n*Investigating the Pivot of the Numinous, Chapter Four.*\n\nTo the southwest of Great Maoshan lies Four-Flat Mountain, commonly known as Square Mountain. At its base is a grotto chamber called Square Terrace. The grotto has two entrances visible from outside the mountain, connecting with Huayang and designated as a secluded lodge of separate chambers. Those who attain the Dao dwell here.\n\n*(This mountain lies some twenty *li* from Great Maoshan. Six or seven *li* to the southwest, one grotto mouth is visible from outside. Recently, someone entered and saw a green serpent within, hence calling it Green Dragon Grotto. Near the summit and on the northern and western faces, there are also grotto cavities—none can determine which are these two entrances. The mountain also has springs that never fail in winter or summer. The mountain’s [text missing] is level, hence the names Four-Flat and Square Mountain. It abounds in southern candlewood; today, it is heaped east of Accumulated Gold Mountain. [Text missing] these trees all grow tall. The Daoists in the lodge rely on them for medicinal use.)*\n\nAmong those who first resided here were Zhang Zuchang and Liu Ping’a.\n\nLu Zihua, Cai Tiansheng, and Long Bogao—all dwelled upon Square Terrace.\n\nZhang Zuchang was a man of Pengcheng. During the Wu dynasty, he came from the north and gained entry to this chamber. Zuchang feigned death by falling from a carriage, thus concealing his form in this secluded lodge to cultivate the practice of *guarding the One*. He took as his master Bao Cha of Shangdang, fifth-generation descendant of Bao Xuan, the Han dynasty Minister over the Masses. Cha received the Dao from Master Wang. (Bao Xuan, Han dynasty Colonel-Director of the Imperial Secretariat, was slain by Wang Mang. Xuan’s son was Yong; Yong’s son was {Rili}; {Rili}’s son was [name missing].)\n\nLiu Ping’a bore no given name or surname, refusing to reveal them to others. At the end of the Han, he served as Chief of Ping’a in Jiujiang, hence his sobriquet. Skilled in the healing arts, he performed acts of virtue, curing others’ illnesses as if they were his own. While traveling, he encountered the immortal Zhou Zhengshi, who taught him the Dao of *concealment and preservation*. Assuming the guise of a hat-wearing traveler, he came to dwell in this chamber. He regularly ingested the *solar and lunar essences*, his complexion like jade, appearing no older than thirty. (How could the two masters not know his true name? Having once revealed it, they chose never to speak of it again. The origins of Dai Meng’s clan are recounted later.)\n\nLu Zihua was a man of Shanyang and a disciple of Master Yin. He had already consumed the *rainbow elixir* but had not yet studied the *Inner Canon*. He came to study under the Eastern Minister, receiving and reciting the *Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean*. He took delight in the seclusion of Square Terrace and had no desire to ascend to the rank of immortal.\n\nCai Tiansheng was a man of Shanggu. In his youth, he served as a whistling attendant to the Master of Whistles, selling assorted incense in the wilds to sustain himself. His nature was kind and sincere.\n\nCai Tiansheng never spoke ill of others. Once, while traveling to purchase incense, he encountered the River Earl’s daughter. Recognizing her as an extraordinary being, he bowed twice and offered her a full eave’s worth of incense. Moved by his sincerity, she taught him the method of paying homage to the Heavenly Emperor and the Jade Sovereign. Thereby he attained immortality, assuming the form of a staff-bearing recluse, dwelling in seclusion upon Square Terrace. The maiden still visits him to this day, and Tiansheng regards her as his master.\n\nLong Bogao was a man of the Later Han. When the Han general Ma Yuan, the Pacifier of the South, admonished his brother’s son, he praised this man as exemplary and worthy of emulation—this was none other than Bogao. Later, Bogao followed the immortal Daolin of the Knife and received the method of fetal ingestion. He also regularly consumed the *Azure Nourishment* formula. Assuming the guise of a drunken death, he concealed himself upon Square Terrace, becoming a disciple of the Master of the Fixed Record. (Bogao’s given name was Shu. A native of the capital district, he served as Magistrate of Shandu during the *Jianwu* era of the Han, rising to the post of Governor of Lingling. When Ma Yuan campaigned in the south, he wrote to his nephew Yan, saying: “Long Bogao is sincere, circumspect, and prudent, his speech beyond reproach. Modest, frugal, and upright, he is both incorruptible and commanding. I cherish and esteem him; may you and your peers take him as your model. Even if you fail to match Bogao, you will still be a man of caution and restraint—like one who carves a swan but falls short, yet still resembles a duck.”)\n\nTo the northeast of Thunderflat Mountain and the southeast of Constantgood Mountain lies Swallowmouth Mountain, so named for its three small peaks standing in close proximity. It is also called Squarecorner Mountain. In ancient times, men once compounded the Nine-Cauldron Elixir here. The Recluse delighted in dwelling here at that time, and still frequents the place. Beneath Squarecorner Mountain lies a grotto chamber called the Square Source Lodge, which has two entrances often visible from without. These five men now sojourn here together. (This mountain lies southwest of the Great Horizontal. Two earthen mounds, resembling a shield and a dragon, once stood nearby, though their names are no longer known. The earlier mention of Li Ming compounding the elixir refers to this place. The Recluse—after Yuan the Assistant departed the world and wished to conceal his name—took this title. Here, before receiving his official appointment, he paused to cultivate his practice in the grotto lodge. The mountain still has two small entrances, and the five men, including the four from Fourflat Mountain, come and go freely, often gathering together. Thus, when Master Yang dreamed of Yuan the Assistant, he said, “I have just come from Fourflat Mountain.” The six entries above were newly transcribed by hand, having been conveyed by the Master of Life Preservation.)\n\nWithin Deer Track Mountain lies an impassable ravine. The “impassable ravine” is a space of barely one or two *mu*, with no passage leading in or out—hence its name. The grotto chamber is surrounded on all sides by blue-white stone, which naturally radiates light like a silken canopy unfurled. The floor is perfectly level, with stone beds and stone couches of varying lengths, their partitions and divisions as though carved with precision, yet all in perfect order. To the northeast is a small opening, barely wide enough for a person to enter. Once inside, one may proceed two or three hundred paces.\n\nUpon reaching the grotto chamber, the entrance is initially narrow, but grows ever more spacious the deeper one proceeds. Outside the entrance to the south lie three piles of stone. Beneath these piles, a rope may be found. Alternatively, a small stone may be used to cover the cave’s opening. The size of the opening resembles the Three Convenient Gates of Huayang. These gates, too, are sealed with small stones. Without prolonged purification and fasting, the rope cannot be found. The Deer Track Grotto is likewise—it does not admit impure *qi*.\n\n(This mountain now lies within the borders of Southern Xuzhou, directly opposite Maoshan. From the north, it can be seen. Daoist adepts also dwell here. The deer tracks are upon the stone, hence the name. The entrance to the grotto is discernible, yet it is kept solemn and pristine, with none daring to profane it. As this text likens it to the Three Convenient Gates of Huayang, the southern and northern grottoes were originally open, while the remaining eastern, western, and southeastern passages were sealed.)\n\nWithin the Deer Track Mountain and its grottoes reside Xie Zhijian and Wang Boliao, also known as Fanyangzi. They are the younger brothers of He Miaoshuda, the Han-era Commandant of Yue Cavalry, born of the same mother, who from youth were fond of the Dao.\n\nThey once dwelled south of Fanshan in Hedong, practicing *fu-shi* (ingesting medicinal substances), hence their self-styled name, Fanyangzi.\n\n*(Zhong Jun, in response to Prefectural Scribe’s inquiry regarding Ge Xuan, stated: \"He resided on Gaizhu Mountain, constantly accompanied by Xie Zhijian. Now Zhijian is here—whether this is the same person coming and going, or if there are two individuals sharing the same name, remains unknown. The *Book of Later Han* records that He Miao was He Jin’s half-brother, serving as General of Chariots and Cavalry. He curried favor with the eunuch faction and, when Jin was assassinated, Miao was slain in battle at the Vermilion Bird Gate by Wu Kuang, one of Jin’s generals, and beheaded. Dong Zhuo later exhumed his corpse and dismembered it. Since he did not deliberately employ *bingjie* (liberation through a violent death) to depart, it is unclear how he came to reside here. Their mother was also executed. Moreover, Miao was not born of the same mother as Jin, and their official ranks differed. The record states his given name was Miao and his courtesy name was Shuda, which does not align with propriety. It is likely he was another brother, not necessarily the Miao who died in battle.\")*\n\nThere was also Feng Liang. Feng Liang, a soldier from Guanjun in Nanyang, began as a county clerk in his youth. At thirty, he became a commandant. While escorting an inspector, he felt ashamed of his lack of ambition. He destroyed his carriage and oxen, tore his robes and headscarf, and departed to study under a master, receiving instruction in the *Book of Songs*, the *Commentaries on the Classics*, the *Book of Rites*, and the *Book of Changes*.\n\nHe further studied Daoist arts and astrological divination. His family believed him dead, yet after fifteen years he returned. He refined his resolve and integrity, maintaining a stern and reverent demeanor. Though the province and commandery extended invitations with honors, he declined. An imperial edict specially summoned him as a worthy and eminent candidate, yet mid-journey he abandoned the post and returned home. At the time, the Three Dukes vied to yield their positions to him, but he would not descend to accept. At sixty-seven, he departed the world, crossing eastward into the mountains. Today he resides in the Deer Track Grotto.\n\n*(A man of the Later Han Emperor An’s reign; the* Han History\n\nShanxing was skilled in the arts of wind-angle divination, mastering the six-day, seven-division method. He could observe qi and foretell fortune or misfortune. He often earned his livelihood through divination. Emperor An summoned him for a policy debate, where he stood out among the scholars. Later, he was appointed magistrate of Wu County. One day, a sudden gale arose, and [Rang] Zong divined that the capital would suffer a great fire. He recorded the date and sent someone to verify—his prediction proved true. The nobles, upon hearing this, memorialized the throne, and he was summoned as a Academician. Zong, ashamed to be known for his divinations, upon receiving the summons, hung his official seal and cord in the county courtyard that very night and fled. He never served again.\n\nHis son, [Qi]ye, styled Zhiyuan, inherited his father’s arts and refined them further. His disciples often numbered in the hundreds. In the second year of Emperor Shun’s *Yangjia* reign, he was summoned to the palace. He submitted a memorial on eleven matters and was appointed Gentleman of the Palace. After returning home, he was murdered by a fellow townsman, Sun Li.\n\nAmong the others were Wang Shuming, Bao Yuanzhi, and Yin Gai’s wife, along with over twenty more. All dwelled in the Northern Mountains, though their names and deeds cannot be fully recorded here. These few were the masters of the secluded grottoes and mountains. The immortals of these secluded grottoes long for those who seek the Dao, wishing to share their cavern abodes, yet in this benighted age, such people are rare.\n\n(These grottoes, being entirely cut off from the world, serve as the dwelling places of earthbound immortals—far beyond the bounds of the thirty-six heavens.)\n\nThe Dao is lost to the adorned. How lamentable! To dwell in a household is to debase oneself.\n\n(*Adorned* refers to those who covet official rank and courtly attire, thus neglecting the Dao. The household is but a temporary lodging.)\n\nWithin these grottoes lies an eternal abode—yet to cling to it with such attachment is truly to debase and ruin oneself. (This, too, serves as a subtle admonition to the Chief Clerk.)\n\nThe Lord of Life-Preservation spoke thus. (The above three entries are Yang’s writings.)\n\nFan Shuai said: The Three Offices have prison officials, not called *Tingwei*, but *Dali*. Li Feng now serves as *Dali*. I still hold one vacant post, intending it for Wang Fuzhi, not to bestow upon Xu Hu. Holding office is like the Three Officials of the prison today. (Li Feng, styled Anguo, later changed to Xuanguo, was a native of Fengyi. Li Yi’s son, originally of humble birth, possessed talent and ambition. He served the Wei as Palace Attendant and President of the Board of Civil Office. Conspiring with Xiahou Xuan to depose the Prince of Jin, Jing Wang, their plot was exposed. Summoned to court, he was struck in the waist with a sword hilt by an attendant. *Dali* should be rendered as *Dali*—the ancient prison official. During the Former Han and Wei dynasties, the *Tingwei* was also called *Dali*. This office is, in fact, a celestial post. Wang Fuzhi is Wang’s childhood name; Xu Hu is Xu Yuya.)\n\nBao {Qingjian} remarked: Since I am now Chief Clerk to your esteemed office, and those rat-like underlings behave as they do, you may inform the Prefect.\n\nHaving thus returned to office, Ying is also under my charge. His family has declined in recent times—what can one do but preserve what remains of them as best one may? (It is likely that *Shuzi* was Bao {Qingjian}’s childhood name. Bao was of Nanhai Prefecture and later achieved liberation through transformation. His sons had not yet returned to the capital, which is why he entrusted them to me. Bao was, in fact, Master Xu’s teacher.)\n\nThe two preceding entries bear Yang’s handwriting.\n\nThe Daoist of Wudang Mountain, Dai Meng, was originally surnamed Yan, named Ji, styled Zhongwei, and lived at the close of Emperor Ming of Han’s reign. Those who cultivate life-concealment all hide their names and birth times, hence he changed his surname to Dai and claimed official appointment under Emperor Wu. Yet this man, from youth, cherished the Dao and virtue, never serving in the world. Orphaned young, he supported his mother; when she died, he observed mourning rites and buried her. Completing his mourning period, he entered Huayang Mountain, consuming *zhu* (atractylodes), rhubarb, Solomon’s seal, mica, realgar, cinnabar, and *zhi* grasses. He received the method from Perfected One Qingling—disciple of Pei of Jizhou—and attained the Way of deathlessness. The Perfected One Pei bestowed upon him a jade pendant, a golden cauldron, scriptures, and the Stone Essence Gold Radiance Talisman. Thereafter, he could move with a light body and vigorous step, traversing the famous mountains.\n\nDaily he could traverse seven hundred *li*, passing through many places. Yet he had still not attained the rank of immortal. (Dai then practiced with the jade pendant and golden cauldron, achieving only deathlessness, not transcendence as a divine immortal—this discrepancy in principle is somewhat difficult to clarify. Later accounts state that *Xuan Zhen* also contains its essential excerpts, and those who practice it become divine immortals who do not die, which again differs from the original scripture. As for the *Stone Essence Gold Radiance Talisman*, since it is not used as a sword, it serves only for liberation and transformation. Those who ingest a single talisman—this talisman governs concealment and reclusion, not vigorous travel. Cultivating the five grades of *zhi*—there are also methods for this in the world.)\n\nThe immortals Guo Zihua, Zhang Jilian, and Zhao Shuda, and later one named Shan Shiyuan, would come and go, journeying with him. Formerly dwelling on Mount Wudang, he now arrives at Great Mount Huo, desiring to receive texts from the Lord of Life-Command. Thus, he has not yet been permitted. (Shan had already attained the rank of Perfected One of Grand Harmony, so he should reside on Mount Taihe in Nanyang. The other three do not appear to have any other notable manifestations.)\n\nMaster Dai patted his belly, wherein lay over ten scrolls of scripture—these were the *Yellow Writ of the Grand Tenuity*. This man was the master of Xie Yun. (According to the oral transmission of the *Golden Register*, the eighth fascicle of the *Yellow Writ of the Grand Tenuity* has a catalog stating there are eight scrolls in total, yet only this one scroll has appeared in the world. Now Master Dai possesses over ten fascicles, which is also inconsistent. The meaning of \"patting the belly\" refers to constantly binding them at the waist. Other transmitted accounts are similar to this. Xie Yun, styled Daotong, was a man of Liyang. In his youth, he was abducted by others.)\n\nHe was sold to Dongyang. Later, he reported the matter to the authorities but was falsely accused and imprisoned in Wushang. The case nearly resulted in his execution. One night, an old man bestowed upon him a talisman, and a youth in yellow robes came and went. Thus, he was spared. During the Xiankang era, he arrived in Xiangyang and entered Mount Wudang, where he met Dai Meng—this was the same man who had previously been in prison with him. Thereupon, he received the Dao. He later took office as magistrate of three counties: Liyang, Xinfeng, and Xidao. Wherever he served, his spiritual efficacy was abundant. Though he lived past seventy, he showed no signs of aging. Eventually, he announced his departure from the world.\n\nThe youth in yellow robes was none other than the official of the Jade Pendant and Golden Bell. It is said that there was always one person seated beside him—*fu er* (likely *rou fu*, though its form is unclear)—who was the Perfected One of the Grand Ultimate, coming and going at times.\n\n(According to this account, it appears to answer a question about the youth in yellow. The meaning may also refer to the hour of *wu*. Since this concerns Xie, it likely stems from a face-to-face inquiry into the matter.)\n\nHaving received and practiced the *Scripture of the Jade Pendant and Golden Bell*, one naturally summons the Perfected One of the Grand Ultimate. As the saying goes: *\"Ingesting the Ninefold Radiance of the sun and moon, one is welcomed into the household of the Grand Ultimate.\"* This is what it means. Such is the method of the Mysterious Perfection.\n\nThis also constitutes its essential excerpts. Those who practice it attain immortality and do not die.\n\nThe Perfected Master Pei had thirty-four disciples: eighteen studied the Buddhist Dao, while the remainder pursued the Dao of immortality (*Beixu*—likely a miswritten form of *Pianhuyong*). (His disciples included Liu Xianlin, Xin Zhongfu, and Zhao Zichang.)\n\nThe Perfected Master Zhou had fifteen disciples, four of whom mastered Buddhist teachings. (His foremost disciples were Wang *Yuwei* Da, Li Jiandao, and Quan Fajian.)\n\nAt Mount Tongbai, there were twenty-five disciples, eight of whom studied Buddhism. (The foremost among them were Yu Hongzhi, Zhu Faling, Zheng Wencheng, and Chen Yuanzi. This list merely highlights the most eminent. Both Xin and Quan appear to bear foreign surnames, likely indicating Buddhist disciples.)\n\nThe above eight entries were transcribed by a clerk and compiled into a single connected record.\n\nIn the mountains of Huo, there were Daoist practitioners Deng Yibo and Wang Xuanfu, who received and practiced the methods of consuming *qingjing* stone-cooked rice and absorbing the solar cinnabar radiance of *danjing*. Through concentrated meditation in the Grotto-Chamber, after thirty-four years, they attained inner vision of the five viscera and the ability to write in darkness at midnight. On the fifth day of the first month of this year, the Supreme Emperor dispatched a feathered chariot to welcome Yibo and Xuanfu. On that very day, they ascended to heaven riding clouds and dragons in broad daylight. Now they reside in the Northern *Xuanpu* Terrace, where they have been appointed as Perfected Ones of the Central Marchmount. (Yibo was from Wu; Xuanfu was from Pei.)\n\nIn the mountains of Huayin, there were Daoist practitioners Yin Qianzi, Zhang Shisheng, and Li Fanghui.\n\nThese were all contemporaries of Emperor Wu of Jin. They received from the immortal Guan Chengzi the method of steaming cinnabar and consuming *Atractylodes*, and by partaking of these, gained longevity and vigorous movement. They further received from Su Men’s Zhou Shouling the Dao of consuming the radiance of *danxia*. Having practiced this for fifty years, they concentrated their minds on inner vision, no longer requiring food or drink. Their bodies became light and strong, their complexions like those of youths. On the twelfth day of the second month of this year, the Supreme Unity dispatched a summons to welcome them. On that very day, they ascended to heaven riding clouds. Now they reside in the Dark Realm, where they have been appointed as Perfected Ones of the Lofty Immortals. Zhang Shisheng was named Earl of the Eastern Source. In Mount Heng, there were Daoist practitioners Zhang Lizheng and Ye Mingqi. Lizheng, having entered the mountains during the late Han, consumed *huangjing*, his complexion remaining robust and youthful, perpetually like that of a man of forty. Mingqi entered the mountains at the end of the Wei and consumed pills of *zexie* and cypress seeds. Together they dwelled in a cave, later both receiving from the Western City Lord Wang the *hongjing* cinnabar formula. They had been consuming this elixir for forty-three years, though they suffered from the scarcity of cinnabar. Both emerged in Guangzhou, becoming Buddhist monks during the tenure of Teng Han as Prefect. Thereupon they attained inner and outer clarity, their eyes bright and bodies light, able to travel five hundred *li* in a day. They also practiced *shouyi*, having maintained this for thirty years. On the first day of the third month, the Eastern Florescence dispatched a summons to welcome them. On that very day, they ascended to heaven riding clouds. Now they reside in the Wind Chamber of the Square Cauldron, both having become Upper Immortals. (Teng Han served as Prefect of Guangzhou in the *jiayin* year of the tenth *Yonghe* reign [354 CE]. Their transcendence occurred in the *yichou* year, twelve years later, meaning they had already been consuming the elixir for thirty-two years before emerging once more.)\n\nIn Mount Qian of Lujiang, there were Daoist practitioners Zheng Jingshi and Zhang Chonghua. Both received oral instructions from the immortal Meng Deran at the beginning of the Jin and entered the mountains to practice the method of guarding the five viscera and containing the solar essence, while also consuming sesame. They further consumed the Dark Elixir. After a long time, they no longer required food or drink, their bodies becoming light and strong, their original forms transformed.\n\nOn the nineteenth day of the fourth month this year, the Northern Mystery Elder Taiyi welcomed him with clouds, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. He now resides in the Dark Realm.\n\nIn Mount Guacang, there was a Daoist practitioner named Ping Zhongjie, a man from Hezhong. During the great Hu turmoil in the Central Plains, he crossed the Yangtze and entered Mount Guacang. There, he received from his master Song Jun the *Way of the Mind-Mirror as a Repository*, mastering the hundred spirits and practicing the *Cavern Chamber* arts. After forty-five years of such cultivation, his meditative essence deepened, his form grew younger, and his body attained genuineness. On the first day of the fifth month this year, the Central Yellow Elder dispatched an envoy to welcome him. That very day, he rode clouds and mounted a dragon, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. He now dwells in the Cloud Terrace of Canglang.\n\n(The \"great Hu turmoil\" refers to the time of Liu Yuan and Liu Cong. Shi Le was the \"lesser Hu.\")\n\nIn Mount Xiaobai, there was a Daoist practitioner named Zhao Guangxin, a man from Yangcheng. At the end of the Wei dynasty, he crossed the Yangtze and entered these mountains. He received from Li Facheng the method of ingestion and from his master Zuo Jun the *Way of Guarding the Dark Center*, through which he perceived the five viscera and mastered the art of penetrating vision. After seventy or eighty years of such practice, he traveled among commanderies and states.\n\nAt times, he would sell medicines and move among the world of men, yet none recognized him. Often, he came to the capital’s markets to purchase cinnabar, from which he refined the *Nine-Flowered Elixir*. Upon completing the elixir, a single dose was taken, and the Supreme Unity Dao Lord dispatched an envoy on the seventeenth day of the sixth month this year to welcome him. After lingering three days to bid farewell to his fellow practitioners in the mountains, he then rode clouds and mounted a dragon, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. He now dwells in the Eastern Flower.\n\nIn the Wolf Five Mountains of the Eastern Sea, there was a Daoist practitioner named Yu Wengsheng, a man from Kuaiji. Formerly, he received from the immortal Jie Jun the method of ingesting solar essence. During the Wu dynasty, he came to conceal himself in these mountains, where he also practiced the *Way of Cloud-Turning and Form-Returning*. Through prolonged and concentrated refinement, his body grew ever younger, like that of a child. On the twenty-third day of the seventh month this year, the Eastern Supreme Emperor dispatched an envoy to welcome him. That very day, he rode clouds and ascended to heaven. He now resides in Mount Yanggu. (The Wolf Five Mountains lie in the sea, opposite the White Chapter Shore, and are now simply called Wolf Mountain.)\n\nIn Red Water Mountain, there was a Daoist practitioner named Zhu Ruzi. At the end of the Wu dynasty, he entered the mountains, where he ingested chrysanthemum and atractylodes. Later, he encountered Xi Gui Zi, from whom he begged the method of transcending the world. Xi Gui Zi transmitted to him essential instructions and the *Method of Visualizing the Mud-Pill Palace*. After thirty years of practice, he could summon clouds and rain within his grotto chamber. On the fifth day of the eighth month this year, the Queen Mother of the West dispatched an envoy to welcome him. That very day, he ascended to heaven in a five-colored cloud chariot. He now dwells on the Terrace of Accumulated Stones. (It is said that Red Water Mountain lies ten *li* south of {Jin Yi} County, accessible by entering three hundred *li* from Nanxi Mouth. The mountain is entirely red, fifty *li* in circumference, and over a thousand *zhang* in height. This should correspond to the Red Rock in the northeast of Yongjia in Linhai. The Red Mountain where Master Xu resided, also called Burning Mountain, is this same place.)\n\nIn the Five Sacred Peaks and other renowned mountains, Daoist practitioners number in the hundreds of thousands. This year alone, those who attained the Dao and ascended to heaven are too numerous to record by name. Every year, every month, there are those who depart. Such accounts cannot be exhaustively chronicled; here, only those who attained the Dao in a single year are briefly noted. Some, though unwilling to ascend as immortals, remain for long ages in the Five Peaks and famous mountains—their number is likewise beyond reckoning. Others serve as immortal officials, charged with overseeing the sacred mountains, and these, too, number in the thousands.\n\nOn the twentieth night of the ninth month, the *Record of the Pure Numinous* was issued. (The preceding eight entries were transcribed by an assistant and compiled into a single scroll. *Pure Numinous* here refers to Pei Qingling. This ninth month should correspond to the *yichou* year, recording those who attained the Dao within that year.)\n\nWu Mu was a man of Chang’an. In his youth, he served as a county clerk, abusing his office to extort the people. When the people brought suit against him, the law demanded his execution. Mu fled in panic, escaping deep into the mountains and forests. After days without food, he came upon a stone chamber where he found Master Sun engaged in reclusive study. Around the chamber, millet and sesame were planted, and the room was always filled with food. Mu arrived and begged for sustenance, remaining for over a month without leaving.\n\nSun the Master knew he was a fugitive but initially made no inquiry. He gave him food, tended to his needs, and taught him scriptures and the Dao, expounding on fortune and misfortune. Upon hearing this, Mu’s heart opened and his mind awakened. He knocked his head to the ground, striking his chest in remorse, confessing the origins of his deeds, the conduct of his life, and the facts of his crimes. He begged for a chance to reform. Thereupon, he remained in the stone chamber, sweeping and serving the Master. After forty years, the Master transmitted the Dao to him. Together they gathered herbs and consumed sesame, diligently cultivating the scriptural teachings. After three hundred and twenty years, he ingested the elixir and ascended to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nZhu {Quantu} was a man of Chenliu. He was lawless, devoting himself to robbery and banditry. Later, when his crimes were discovered and men came to seize him, {Quantu} escaped and fled far to another region. He arrived at Shaoshi Mountain in Runan, where he encountered Master Feng engaged in reclusive study. The Master said that after three years, he would transmit to him the Way of the Perfected Immortals. He remained in the mountains, consuming herbs and cultivating the Dao for thirty-eight years. Later, he entered the Eastern Mountains, living to the age of one hundred and forty-seven. An immortal descended and led him into the cavern of Dayou Mountain, where he became a Perfected One.\n\nGuo Jing was a man of Yingchuan. Orphaned in youth, he had no parents, and his brothers lived in poverty and hardship.\n\nWith nowhere to settle, he wandered without refuge. At sixteen, the county summoned him to serve as an official. Later, he committed an offense and fled into hiding, remaining concealed for two months without emerging. He encountered Master Zheng, who saved and delivered all beings, exhorting him with the Dharma. Jing then followed Zheng, carrying his eaves and tending to his needs for seven years without敢懈怠. He received the essentials of Daoist guiding and pulling, consuming mountain yam and poria. He attained a lifespan of three hundred years. Later, on Tianwei Mountain, Master Red Pine descended to transmit the true Dao to both of them. Now, he resides in the cavern of Dayou as a Perfected One.\n\nFan Boci was a man of Guiyang. His family originally followed worldly customs, but he suddenly fell into madness and evil influences, contracting a consumptive illness that confined him to his bed for over a year. His family invited physicians and expended their wealth, yet his condition remained incurable. Hearing that the Great Dao was pure and required no offerings, his resolve shifted. Learning of Shen Jing’s diligent cultivation as a Daoist and his efficacy in healing, he abandoned worldly affairs to follow him. After fifty days, all his ailments were cured. Later, he sought out Lu Wanzhi to receive the true inner Dao. Wanzhi could not enter the mountains, but Boci, discontent with the world, bid farewell and entered Tianmu Mountain. There, he consumed sesame and cultivated with focused intent for seventeen years. The Perfected Lord of the Great Cavern and Controller of Destiny descended to transmit the thirty-six-scroll scripture. Later, he ingested the returning elixir and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Now, he is the Perfected One of Mysterious Unity.\n\n*(The passages marked \"云云\" were omitted by the copyist, not due to any lacuna in the original. There are four entries, transcribed by someone in the eastern region who claimed them to be authentic texts, though their authorship and transmission remain unknown. As their content is meaningful, they are recorded here in continuation.)*\n\nThese four individuals each had their own circumstances: the first was a harsh official, the second a violent bandit, the third orphaned and destitute, and the fourth bound to worldly affairs—all enduring the meager fortunes of the mortal realm. Yet they attained the Dao, demonstrating that its realization depends on the mind’s creation, not on good or evil.\n\nSima Jizhu later entered the stone chamber of the Weiyu Mountain’s Dayou Palace, where he received the *Method of Transforming Form through Stone Essence and Golden Radiance* from Xiling Zidu. Xiling Zidu was the Celestial Maiden of Supreme Mystery. Among those who now reside in the Dayou chamber with him is Bao Shuyang of Guangning.\n\nThe men of Taiyuan, Wang Yangbo, and of Yingchuan, Liu Yuwei, as well as Duan Jizheng of Daijun, all received the Dao from their master, Xiling Zidu. As Jizhu prepared to depart, he left behind a simulacrum of himself upon his pillow and mat to serve as his likeness. His tomb lies south of Shengpan Mountain in Chengdu of Shu Commandery. In former times, Marquis Wu of the Zhuge clan erected a stele before Jizhu’s tomb to inscribe his virtue. At the end of the stele’s eulogy, it reads:\n\n*\"In the vast and silent mystery,\nYin and Yang merge as one.\nHeaven and Earth unite in balance,\nAnd the ten thousand beings flourish in clarity.\nThe Master’s principles are manifest—\nDiscerning softness and hardness.\nSpirits and gods bear witness,\nWhile the Six Perfections shine forth.\"*\n\n(*The* Zhen Gao *states that Jizhu swallowed rainbow essence, yet his head and feet came to rest in separate places. The commentary to the* Sword Classic *says, ‘He ingested the elixir blade, and worms flowed from his body.’ Now, according to the account of the Eastern Minister, he left behind a simulacrum upon his pillow and mat to serve as his likeness—this likely refers to his departure through the ‘spirit-pill transmigration’ method. Since the Han histories do not clearly record his end, there is no way to further discern the details of the matter.*)\n\nThe Guangning Master Bao Shuyang was a grandee under King Zhang Er and King Zhang Ao of Zhao during the reign of Emperor Gao of Han. From youth, he cultivated longevity practices. After ingesting cassia powder, he died suddenly in a privy. His tomb now lies on the northern mountain of Jicheng in Liaodong. (Emperor Gao established the Yan Commandery, with Ji as its seat—this likely refers to the time before its division.)\n\nThe Taiyuan Master Wang Yangbo was originally Wang Tan, a Palace Attendant and Zhonglang of Langye during the regency of Empress Lü under Emperor Gao of Han. From youth, he consumed *ze xie*. Together with the Marquis of Liu, Zhang Liang, he gathered herbs on Mount Zhongnan, but Wang Yangbo did not keep pace. He then became a disciple of Jizhu. (In the Former Han, Palace Attendants were not eunuchs, and Zhonglang was not an office of the Gentlemen of the Palace—this position may have been established later.)\n\nThe Yingchuan Master Liu Hui was originally Liu Feng, a Master of Public Carriages under Emperor Jing of Han. Later, he studied under Jizhu. In his later years, he ingested the essences of the sun and moon, becoming an inner-chamber disciple. After attaining the Dao, he returned to his hometown in his later years. Leaving behind his form in staff and sandals, he died beneath a mulberry tree. His tomb now lies on the western mountain of Ancheng County in Runan.\n\nThe Daijun Master Duan Jizheng was originally a recluse. No records exist of his ingestions. In his later years, he studied the Dao under Jizhu.\n\nCrossing the Qinzhou Reedy Waters, he was detained and drowned, his body recovered and buried by the riverbank. This is present-day Qinchuan in Nanzheng. This man was also an inner-chamber disciple of Jizhu. (Upon examining these four individuals, all employed the arts of the Spirit Pellet and miscellaneous liberations.)\n\nJizhu had one son and one daughter, both of whom attained the Dao. The son was named Fayu, and the daughter was named Jihua. Both now reside within Mount Weiyu. Jihua is presently reciting the Thirty-Nine Chapters, though she has yet to complete them. (This principle is also difficult to expound in detail.)\n\nJizhu recited the Jade Scripture and ingested the essence of Bright Cinnabar. His hands cradled the radiance of dawn, and his complexion today remains that of a twenty-year-old maiden. His beard measures three feet in length, black as ink. Yesterday, the Eastern Minister recounted this, just as I have set it down—truly a wondrous affair. Yet I know not how it may truly be. (This line was recorded by Master Yang in a letter to the Prefectural Governor. The phrase of uncertainty may indicate another meaning.)\n\nJizhu relinquished his form and concealed his light, hiding his traces in Mount Weiyu. The *Purple Yang Tradition* fully records these matters. Last night, the Eastern Minister arrived, and I ventured to inquire about Jizhu’s origins and later years. The Eastern Minister responded, instructing me to set it down separately, as presented above. I hope you will not take offense. Once read, consign it to the flames. (This is Master Yang’s letter to the Prefectural Governor. The *Biographies of Perfected Transcendents* compiled by Zhou Jun of present times records Jizhu’s affairs only briefly. No other authentic handwritten account has been seen. Judging by these words, it appears to be incorrect. It seems there was a preceding annotation, but one line is now missing.)\n\nWhat follows is the record of the Sagely Master Li. In general, it aligns with the foregoing, though the Eastern Minister has additionally provided annotations. The annotations approach ten thousand characters—a most extraordinary work. Recently, we have discussed many matters of divine transformation, and Jizhu’s case was briefly mentioned. Last month, I was further entrusted with the *Commentary on the Scripture of the Divine Tiger*. The commentary is unlike anything heard in the world, and I myself do not yet grasp its purport. Should I learn of others like Jizhu, I shall certainly report it in confidence. (This is also Master Yang’s letter to the Prefectural Governor. Since it concerns Jizhu’s affairs, I have placed it in sequence here rather than appending it to the lower scroll. The Prefectural Governor, compiling the *Biographies of Perfected Transcendents*, wished to place Jizhu first. Thus, Master Yang sought to inquire about his origins and later years. The two scriptures annotated by the Director of Destinies have yet to be revealed to the world.)\n\nThe above ten entries contain Yang’s writings. Fan Anyuan recently remarked, “Zhanzi did not serve the Qi.”\n\nThe Qi forces attacked him. The *Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"Zhan was without propriety.\" (This refers to an event in the *Zuozhuan*. The character {言甚} is written as 谭. Its pronunciation is *tan*. It is the name of a state. In the thirteenth year of Duke Zhuang’s reign, it was destroyed by Duke Huan of Qi. The reason for recounting this here is unclear, though it seems to allude to something.)\n\nZhuangzi studied under Master Changsang, who transmitted to him esoteric teachings, whence he was called Zhuangzi. He concealed himself on Mount Baodu, ingested the Northern Nurturing Fire Elixir, and ascended to heaven in broad daylight, whereupon he was appointed to the rank of Attendant Gentleman of the Gate of the Supreme Ultimate. (Master Changsang was the teacher of Bian Que, as recorded in the *Wei Chronicles* and the *Records of the Grand Historian*. If the world truly knew Zhuangzi to have been such a figure, his writings would be all the more esteemed.)\n\nShi Cun was a native of Qi who styled himself the \"Gentle Basin Master.\" He attained the Dao of escape, transformation, and luminous manifestation, and now resides on Mount Song. Some say that in the past, there was a Master Gourd on Mount Shaoshi—this was none other than he. However, he has not yet received the scriptures of the Most High, and thus has not yet attained Perfection. His practice of the Jade Axe and the Military Fire Talismans represents but a branch of what he has received. Shi Cun was among the three thousand disciples of Confucius. (That one of the three thousand should be such a figure, yet not numbered among the seventy-two, makes clear that the Master did not teach the Dao of immortality. Master Gourd was the teacher of Fei Changfang. The Military Fire Talisman remains extant in the world. The above three entries contain Yang’s writings.)\n\nHan Weiyuan, the Perfected One of Mount Jiuyi, once received teachings from Song Dexuan of Mount Song. Dexuan was a man of the Zhou King Xuan era.\n\nThose who ingest this *Lingfei Liujia* attain the Dao, gaining the ability to travel three thousand *li* in a single day and repeatedly transform their forms into birds and beasts. Having obtained the Way of the Dark and Numinous, they now dwell on Mount Songgao. Weiyuan followed them for a long time before receiving the method, and through its practice, he achieved the completion of the Way. He now resides on Mount Jiuyi. Among his female disciples were Guo Shaoyao, Zhao Aier, Wang Lulian, and others—several dozen in all—who likewise received this method and attained the Dao. Some roam the Dark Continent, while others dwell on the Eastern Florescence Terrace or the Square Cauldron Terrace; all remain present today.\n\nThe Lady of the Southern Marchmount spoke of this, saying: Guo Shaoyao was the daughter of Guo Jian, the Han general who crossed the Liao River and Duke of Dongping. From youth, she was deeply devoted to the Dao. The Perfected One thus transmitted to her the *Liujia*. Zhao Aier was the elder sister of Zhao Gai, the Prefect of Youzhou and Chief Clerk to Liu Yu, the Inspector of Yuyang. Fond of the Dao, she achieved liberation through the corpse and later received this talisman. Wang Lulian was the daughter of Wang Bogang, the City Gate Commandant of Fanyang during the reign of Emperor Ming of Wei. She too studied the Dao, and one day suddenly abandoned her husband, Li Ziqi.\n\nEntering the mountains of Luhun, the Perfected One transmitted this method to her. Ziqi was a man of Wei in Sizhou and tutor to the Prince of Qinghe. He often spoke of this woman’s mad flight, saying that one day she vanished without a trace. (This account appears in the *Scripture of the Numinous Flight and Six Jia*; the Chief Clerk copied it out.)\n\nThe Han Grand General Huo Guang had a slave in charge of his wardrobe named Huanche, who once observed two stars and thereby attained an age of six hundred years; he remains there still. (This account appears in the *Scripture of the Square Cauldron and Cavern Chamber*; the later Chief Clerk copied it out. According to the *Book of Wei*, in the first year of the Qinglong era, the Inspector of Bingzhou, Bi Gui, sent a Xian slave of the Han General Who Crossed the Liao, Fan Mingyou, aged three hundred and fifty years, who ate and drank like an ordinary person. The slave said: \"Huo Xian was the lesser wife of the Director of the Palace Banquet. Hu You’s wife was the former wife of the Director of the Palace Banquet.\" If one follows this wife, it is certainly not false.)\n\nThose who ingested the blossoms of langgan jade and then tended their graves at Yingqiu were Yanmenzi, Gaoqiuzi, and Master Hongya. Yanmenzi’s grave lies in Yuyang’s Shuilu County. (In Yuyang of Youzhou there is a Shuilu County; today in Shangdang there is also a Shuilu County. Yanmen is the same as Xianmen.) Gaoqiuzi’s grave lies in Wenxi County of Zhongshan. (In Zhongshan there is Anxi County; Wenxi belongs to Hedong.) Master Hongya’s grave lies in Guzang County of Wuwei. (The *Records of Liangzhou* call it Guzang County.) The people of these three commanderies all speak of this.\n\nThe ancient tombs of the dead are now empty. Yet it was not known that in Gaoqiuzi’s time, he achieved liberation through the corpse and entered the Six Radiance Mountains. Later, he ingested the powder of golden liquor and further received the blossoms of langgan jade in Zhongshan. Only then did he feign death, entering the Dark Realm, where he received scriptures and became the Perfected One of the Central Marchmount—and he remains there to this day. Yanmenzi now resides in the Golden Court of the Great Cavern of Mount Meng, where he received scriptures and became the Immortal Minister of the Middle Prime. Master Hongya is now the Perfected One of Qingcheng. Those who rinsed with dragon embryo and parted through death, or drank jade essence and knocked upon their coffins, were the former masters Wang Xicheng, Zhao Boxuan, and Liu Zixian. (Master Wang once used the sword for liberation, not the dragon embryo or various elixirs; perhaps \"jade essence\" refers to quchen.) Those who ingested golden elixirs and met their end were Zang Yanfu, Zhang Zifang, and Mo Dizi. Those who took nine cycles of the pill and left their corpses behind, or swallowed the *naogui* and had insects flow from their bodies, were Sima Jizhu, Ning Zhongjun, King Yan of Zhao, and Prince Jin. (Tongbo also used the sword for liberation; this should refer to those who swallowed the *naogui*, not the nine cycles. Sima Jizhu also employed divine pills for martial liberation, as the *Right Radiance* states: \"Head and feet in separate places.\")\n\nKing Yan of Zhao pursued immortality yet left no distinct traces. (Jingchun remarked: \"Had there been no efficacy, he would have investigated the matter earlier.\") King Mu of Zhou journeyed north to the slopes of Kunlun, where he personally drank the crimson marrow of Mount Jiang and partook of the fruit of the jade trees, yet his tomb lies in Jijun. (This account is recorded in the *Chronicles of King Mu*, from the time he met the Queen Mother of the West.) Great Yu visited Mount Zhong, where he consumed purple *mushi*, became intoxicated on golden wine, ingested the *Lingbao*, and practiced the Nine Perfections, yet he was still buried in Kuaiji. (This matter also appears in the *Five Talismans*; the *Teachings of Master Mao* further states he received and practiced the Way of Profound Perfection.)\n\nThe Great King of the Northern Rong, Changhu, presented Emperor Shun with the frost of white *lang* and the ten-cycle Purple Flower, elixirs that grant long life and flight to transcendence, aligning one with Heaven and Earth. Yet Shun consumed them and soon died, buried in the wilds of Cangwu. These lords had already ascended the numinous slopes with dragon hymns and stirred the cloud pools with phoenix drums, yet they still employed corpse-liberation and feigned death—seeking to sever the bonds of life and death, and to show the people the limits of beginning and end. How could this be the same as the decaying corpses in the Great Yin, flesh offered to ants? Their intent was simply to restrain those who defy the world and to block the aspirations of the vulgar.\n\n(Though among the sagely kings of antiquity, none have shown clear signs of Yao or Tang attaining the Dao, nor traces of their becoming spirit-officials—)\n\nAs for Master Qingjing, Peng Keng, Feng Gang, the Four Elders of Mount South, and the Eight Lords of Huainan, all consumed the supreme elixirs, yet not a single dose. They themselves chose their words and deeds, retiring in seclusion to the mountains and forests, delighting in roaming as immortals, grieving only at ascending the void. It was not that they could not ascend to Heaven—they simply chose not to. These lords wandered freely among the Five Peaks, altering their names and appearances, no longer resorting to the ultimate art of corpse-liberation.\n\n(Peng Keng is the name of Peng Zu. Qingjing also appears in Peng’s *Traditions* and the *Transmissions of Lord Wang* among the methods for consuming *shi-xun* rice. Feng Gang and the other immortals each have their own distinct manifestations.)\n\nThe Yellow Emperor himself mined copper from Mount Shou to cast the tripod, while tigers, leopards, and a hundred beasts tended the fires and assisted at the furnace. Once the tripod was completed, the Yellow Emperor suddenly passed away and was buried on Mount Qiao. Five hundred years later, the mountain collapsed, revealing an empty chamber with no corpse—only a treasured sword with a vermilion scabbard remained. One day, even that vanished without a trace.\n\n(The *Traditions of the Immortals* records: riding dragons while grasping their whiskers, and Prince Jin driving a swan—all differing accounts.)\n\n(This may also be a case of transformation followed by reappearance.) Master Jade was the father of Emperor Yao. He once journeyed to Mount Zhong, where he obtained the *Scripture of Nine Transformations and Ten Changes*, enabling him to conceal the sun and moon and wander among the stars. Later, he suddenly fell ill and passed away, his tomb established on Mount Bohai. During the decline of the Xia dynasty, someone opened the prince’s tomb, finding the chamber entirely empty—only a sword remained on the northern couch, emitting the roars of dragons and the howls of tigers. No one dared approach it, and afterward, it too vanished without a trace. (The father of Yao is written as 帝{人告} in some texts, while external records use the character {学告}.)\n\nThe tomb of Prince Wang Qiao lies in Jingling. During the Warring States period, it was opened again, revealing only a sword in the chamber. Just as someone attempted to examine it, the sword suddenly flew into the heavens. Luan Ba once achieved liberation through martial transformation, departing to reside in Mount Linlü. After thirteen years, he returned home and now dwells in Mount Chimei Redstone. (*The Book of Han* states that Luan Ba served as governor of Guiyang and Yuzhang before being imprisoned and executed—this was likely a case of using the *Lingwan* elixir for liberation, as also recorded in the *Transmissions of the Immortals*.)\n\nThese three accounts are all excerpted from the hand-copied *Sword Scripture*, a text not easily encountered. Since they describe the deeds of various immortals, I have carefully transcribed them here to supplement the categories. Where do the perfected ones reside? Radiant as the southern star, they embrace the myriad ages, ascending on light to revolve above. Transforming into the Three Ways, with the sun and moon as neighbors, they are truly profound, truly masters—known as the Primal Ones. Changing into the Three Elders, they befriend the ancestors of emperors. How could one know the perfected? They do not come to wander, observing the signs of transformation among mortals, blending with the world as companions. Casting off their feathers and sinking their bells, they rest in the southern lands—how could they delight in omens, lingering long among the俗?\n\nFrom the *Mysterious Records of the Seven Sages*: When the Red Lord descended to teach, he altered his traces and took the form of a śramaṇa, revealing the names of himself and his six disciples. Bound by the world’s defilements, he did not conform to the age’s destiny. The Red Omen lurked in terror, and the Three Pillars brought calamity. The worthy ones journeyed south, making for the Three Peaks. The Dark Lord came forth—who among men could know him?\n\n(The Red Omen is the delusive star of {tomb-fire}; the Three Pillars are three stars within the Five Chariots. *Step* is read *lǚ*, returning.)\n\nIn the Primal Realm, he is the Primal Lord; in the Dark Palace, the Dark Master; at the Southern Star, the Old Man of the Southern Culmen; in the Great Void, the Perfected of the Great Void; on the Southern Peak, Red Pine Master. He is the teacher of the Celestial Thearch’s Four Perfected Ones and the companion of the Great One.\n\n(These four passages were transcribed by the Senior Archivist. It is unclear from which scripture they originally derive, but all expound the teachings of the Red Lord of the Southern Peak—his titles as master and companion—with slight variations from other texts.)\n\nMount Tongbai rises eighteen thousand *zhang* high. Its eightfold ridges encircle over eight hundred *li*, appearing identical from all four sides. It stands at the eastern sea’s edge in Kuaiji, one end submerged in the ocean. Within Tongbai lies the Land of Immortality of Golden Court, forty *li* in circumference, veiled by yellow clouds. Its trees bear jade-teeth and sapphire fruits; its springs flow with stone marrow and golden essence. The mountain is wholly composed of five-colored gold. Journeying south along the Cinnabar River, one finds a cavern where paths converge—passing through it for over thirty *li* leads to the destination.\n\n(This mountain now lies within the borders of several counties, including Linhai. The submerged end is today called Kuocang, situated north of Ninghai County and south of {Jin Yi}. Golden Court is the place referred to by the former Right Assistant Minister. Though this site lies beyond the mountain, it resembles Golden Numen, yet its numinous wonders surpass it. Few today know its true location, though those gathering vines occasionally encounter and enter it.)\n\nThe {Tuwu} and {Fu'ao} abound here—naturally, one may seek them out. Yet since I have already settled in Wu, how could I again search for them in Yue? Thus, I set my heart at rest.\n\n(The office of the Perfected One of Tongbai is, after all, within the grotto-heaven.)\n\nThe Lady of Purple Tenuity said: The following passage is from a certain text:\n\nThe Eight Stillnesses Mountain rises five thousand *li* high and spans {seven thousand} *li* in circumference. It adjoins the Square Mountain of Canglang, and beneath it lies the Azure Sea. Upon the mountain stands the Dark Pool Mystic Palace of the Forest-Riding Perfected One, the domain governed by the Eastern King Father. This mountain is composed of numinous jades and jasper, bearing blue-green blossoms and crimson fruits, while flying gold issues forth from its crevices. It lies northeast of Canglang Mountain and southeast of Penglai Mountain.\n\n(This is the dwelling of the Great Thearch of Fusang. The Square Mountain is Mount Fangzhang, a renowned island in the sea, frequently mentioned in the *Preface to the Five Marchmounts*.)\n\nTo the northwest of Fangzhang stands the great Yin Completeness Mountain, and to the southwest of Canglang lies the great Yang Perpetuity Mountain. Each encircles fourteen hundred *li* and rises seven hundred *li* in height.\n\nThis mountain is the dwelling place of many perfected transcendents and immortals. These two mountains serve as the markers of the Yang Nine and Hundred Six kalpas. When the Hundred Six kalpa approaches, the waters of Yang Perpetuity Mountain recede, while those of Yin Completeness Mountain rise. When the Yang Nine kalpa approaches, the waters of Yin Completeness recede, while those of Yang Perpetuity rise. Recently, it has been the turn of Yin Completeness, and its waters have already risen nine thousand *zhang* above the mountain’s base. The arrival of the Hundred Six kalpa is not far off. (When the water’s edge of Yin Completeness emerges so high above the mountain, this should correspond to the Yang Nine kalpa, yet it is spoken of as the Hundred Six—this may be a misstatement. Alternatively, it could mean the water’s rise has reached such a height, not that the water first receded. Yet water seeks its own level and is not swift or turbulent. The two mountains are not far apart; how could one stand so abruptly isolated?)\n\nThe following two entries were transcribed by the Senior Scribe: Before reaching the first high mountain west of the temple, at the northern end of Dragon’s Tail, there is a great spring. It bursts forth from the earth, over six *zhang* in length and five *zhang* in width, penetrating six *chi* into the ground. Its flow strikes the earth for over two hundred *bu* before diverging three *li* from the road. Opposite the second high mountain west of the temple’s rear, there is another great spring. It emerges from the earth, over four *zhang* in length and three *chi* in width, penetrating four *chi* into the ground. Its force scours the earth for over three hundred *bu* before diverging two *li* from the road. Near the temple’s rear flank, there is yet another great spring. It issues from the earth, over five *zhang* in length and four *zhang* in width, penetrating slightly over two *chi* into the ground. Its flow converges inward, one hundred fifty *bu* from the temple.\n\nNorth of Jiang Mountain, there are three such erupting springs, their currents flowing northwest. These three entries record strange phenomena, yet as no eyewitness account exists, their veracity remains uncertain. It is also unknown when these eruptions occurred. To the south of the mountain, there are documented sites of such outflows, now blocked with piled stones and called \"Jiang Hou’s Watering Place.\" No such traces are found behind the mountain—perhaps these mark the appointed time of a future kalpa.\n\n*True Reports*, Scroll Fourteen.\n*True Reports*, Scroll Fifteen.\n*Revealing the Subtle*, First Chapter.\n\nMount Luo {lies in the northern *gui* region. (This *gui* region need not refer to the six directions but likely indicates a bearing from the Central Kingdom, directly facing the north of Youzhou and Liaodong, in the midst of the Northern Sea—its distance from shore is unknown, measured in tens of thousands of *li*.)} The mountain rises two thousand six hundred *li* in height and spans thirty thousand *li* in circumference. Beneath it lies a grotto-heaven, fifteen thousand *li* in circumference. Above and below, there are palaces of spirits and gods. On the mountain stand six palaces, and within the grotto are six more, each spanning a thousand *li* in circumference. These are the palaces of the Six Heavens’ spirits and gods. (If each palace were fifteen thousand five hundred *li* in circumference, there would be three hundred twenty-five such sites. Here, only six palaces are mentioned, leaving three hundred nineteen unaccounted for. Such a vast expanse seems implausible; perhaps there are errors or omissions in the text.) The palaces above are the outer courts, while those within the grotto are the inner courts, their systems being equivalent. (Since this mountain lies beyond human reach, its summit may accommodate such structures—though how many grotto-gates exist remains unknown.)\n\nThe first palace is named the Palace of Zhou’s Absolute Yin Heaven. Proceeding eastward in sequence...\n\nWithin the grotto, a straight passage extends three thousand seven hundred fifty *li* from east to west. Now, if one palace spans two thousand *li* in circumference, its diameter would be two hundred fifty *li*. Were the six palaces arranged side by side, they would occupy but one thousand five hundred *li*—leaving over twenty *li* to spare on either side. The distance to the south and north is far greater, for all must serve as protective barriers; otherwise, their purpose would remain unfathomable.\n\nThe second palace is named the Palace of Tai Liang’s Ancestral Heaven of Affairs. The third palace is named the Palace of Ming Chen’s Enduring Martial City Heaven. The fourth palace is named the Palace of Tian Zhao’s Sinful Qi Heaven. The fifth palace is named the Palace of Zong Ling’s Sevenfold Transgressions Heaven. The sixth palace is named the Palace of Gan Si’s Linked and Repeated Heaven.\n\n(These six heavenly palaces each must bear some significance, though their meanings can only be roughly discerned and ought not be lightly expounded.)\n\nThese six heavenly palaces constitute the governance of the spirits and gods of the Six Heavens. The six palaces within the grotto share the same names and are identical in form.\n\n(This should correspond to the dwelling where the Ghost King adjudicates the sins of the dead—a place the scriptures refer to as the abode of King Yama. This king is now the Northern Great Emperor. Yet it remains unclear which deities preside over the Five Paths. All living beings, upon death, fall under their jurisdiction. As for the locations of hells, they are not confined to a single place; Mount Tai, rivers, and seas each have their own. The outer palaces of this mountain likely serve as administrative offices, overseeing records and documents, while the inner palaces within the grotto are where the dead reside and undergo judgment. Accounts from scribes tell of those who died and revived, all reporting that they first journeyed northward to the palaces and courts for examination.)\n\nAt times, it resembles passing through city gates where documents are inspected—likely all occurring within the outer palaces atop this mountain. As with Humu Ban’s journey to the Lord of Mount Tai’s abode, one may unknowingly enter the grotto. Perhaps ghosts and spirits are illusory, preventing mortals from perceiving the truth.\n\nThose among the living who know the names of the Six Heavenly Palace Gates need only recite them thrice while facing north before sleep, in a low voice, and the hundred ghosts will not dare to harm them. (Earlier, they were called palace names; now, gate names. The gates derive their names from the palaces. The palaces are but empty titles, while the gates bear inscribed placards visible to all ghosts—and now to mortals as well, which is why they submit in awe.)\n\nThe incantation goes:\n*\"I am a disciple of the Most High, governing the Six Heavens below. The Six Heavenly Palaces are under my command—not only under my command, but under the authority of the Most High. I know the names of the Six Heavenly Palaces, and thus I attain longevity. Should any dare to transgress, the Most High shall sever your form.\"*\n\n(Here, \"governing the Six Heavens below\" means they are not governed by the Six Heavens. Not only do I command them myself, but the Most High has ordered me to oversee them, thus reinforcing my authority—much like officials in commanderies and counties who receive imperial appointments, not mere blank commissions.)\n\nThe first palace is named the *Zhoujue Yintian Palace*. Proceeding eastward in order, the second palace is named— (These two characters in Yang Jun’s manuscript appear at the bottom of the page, but the copyist, unfamiliar with them, rendered them as seven characters. All contemporary versions mistakenly list this as the seventh palace. This is an error, for there are only six palaces—how could there be seven? The incantation’s phrase \"proceeding eastward in order\" is meant to astonish the ghosts by demonstrating knowledge of their sequential positions.)\n\nContinuing in this manner through the sixth palace, one then taps the teeth six times before lying down, to ward off the qi of malevolent ghosts. (After reciting the incantation once and tapping the teeth six times, the process is repeated twice more before sleep.)\n\n(This method has already been transcribed in detail in the third chapter on cultivation practices.)\n\nWhen a person first dies, they all proceed to the *Zhoujue Yintian Palace* to receive their fate. Some may first go to famous mountains, Mount Tai, or rivers, but they do not necessarily go directly to the first heaven. Only on the day of their judgment—when their sins are examined and their fortune determined—must they come to this first heavenly palace. (This palace is governed by the Northern Emperor, and all matters must ultimately pass through it—like prefectural and county prisons, which, though initially under local jurisdiction, must eventually be sent to the capital for final sentencing.)\n\nThe *Tailiang Shizong Tian Palace* and its attendant ghosts constitute the second heaven. Those who die suddenly or violently also pass through here.\n\n(This palace is specifically responsible for their collection. Those who die suddenly or violently may have unresolved records or share names with others, so they first come here for verification and inquiry.)\n\nWhen virtuous persons and sages pass away, they first proceed to the *Mingchen Third Heaven Palace* to receive their fate. (Later texts mention the *Four Bright Lords*, each governing one palace—it is unclear which lord resides over these two palaces, *Tailiang* and *Mingchen*. Though those who die violently and the virtuous and sagely may temporarily pass through here first, they must still ultimately proceed to the *Zhoujue* for final judgment.)\n\nFortune and misfortune, blessings and calamities, the extension of life or the imposition of guilt—all are determined in the *Tianzhao Fourth Heaven Palace*, governed by the *Ghost Official* and the *Lord of Earthly Dipper*. (Here, the merits and transgressions of one’s former life are once more recorded. Yet Wu, who died for his utmost loyalty, must surely be ranked among the immortals.)\n\n*Han Taihua* was the sister of *Han Anguo* and the wife of *Li Guangli*, the Han general of the Two Armies. *Guangli* possessed accumulated merit from past lives, and now resides in the *Southern Palace* undergoing transformation. (Though *Guangli*, as a renowned Han general, killed many in his campaign against *Dayuan*, his merits from former lives enabled him to transcend this.)\n\nHan An Guo, styled An Guo, was of such blessed fortune that it should not have been tied to the Li family’s support. Yet as husband and wife share the same fate, there arose concern that others might suspect otherwise—hence the separate notation here. (This may also have arisen from karmic conditions.)\n\nLiu Chunlong was the daughter of Liu Fengxian, Han’s *Zongzheng* (Minister of the Imperial Clan). (Fengxian served as *Zongzheng* during the reign of a certain Han emperor.)\n\nLi Xizi was the grandmother of Li Zhong. (Zhong was *Taishou* of Dongping in the early Jin dynasty. His grandfather was a commoner, a farmer. Yet he practiced many hidden virtues: during heavy snow and bitter cold, he would not cover his stored grain, leaving it exposed in the courtyard, ever fearful that birds and sparrows might starve. Such was the depth of his care.)\n\n(Though Li Zhong does not appear in the *Book of Jin*, this account suggests that his wife’s transcendence may have arisen from her husband’s merit, while his own reward remains unseen—a matter difficult to explain in detail.)\n\nWang Jinxian was the daughter of Wang Yan. (Details follow below.)\n\nGuo Shuxiang was the mother of Wang Xiu. (Wang Xiu, styled Shuzhi, was a native of Beihai.)\n\nWang Xiu served as *Langzhong Ling* under Emperor Wu of Wei. At the age of seven, he lost his mother. She died on a *du* day, but her surname and family remain unknown.\n\nIn his youth, the prefecture office had three notable figures: Wang Shaodao, Fan Shusheng, and Li Boshan—all paragons of the prefecture in their time. Shaodao was fond of the Dao and was the same Wang Dun’er who had been *Taishou* of Shanyang during the Han. Fan Shusheng was a native of Beidi and later served as *Huangmen Lang* under Emperor Wen of Wei. Li Boshan was the father of Li Chong, who had been *Ling* of Baima during the Han and practiced hidden virtues. Some inherit the Dao across generations, their virtue accumulating through the ages—such was the case with these two prefectures’ transcendents, who advanced step by step to enter this rank.\n\nXiang Liangcheng composed the *Palace Chant*, which reads:\n*\"Zhou’s end severed the imperial dawn,\nIn truth, affairs entangled in layered deceit.\nFlaming as smoke in the vault of heaven,\nBursting like radiant brilliance.\nWuyang girds the divine blade,\nSerene and luminous, swallowing the Azure River.\nThe gates of Chang swing open to the cinnabar well,\nCloud gates rise in towering majesty.\nSeven wrongs traverse the wondrous canopy,\nLinked bends spread their enchantments.\nSix heavens bar the northern path—\nThis is the domain of ghosts and spirits.\"*\n\nThe chant comprises twenty thousand words; here, only the names of the Six Heavenly Palaces are excerpted. It may be recited softly at night to repel malevolent spirits.\n\n(Formerly, the third palace was named *Wucheng*; here it is called *Wu[BeiBei]*. Perhaps it bears two names. The *Biography of Su Shao* states that among the sagely was Xiang Liang the Righteous, and among the worthy, the virtuous Master Ji. Yet it remains unclear to which era Xiang belonged—some speculate he was Xiang Yu’s uncle, Xiang Liang, though he should not be ranked above Master Ji.)\n\nThe grain *zhongsi* has kernels like pomegranate seeds—exceptionally large and distinct, their color and flavor resembling water caltrop. It was also offered to the transcendents above.\n\n(There is a later account of *zhongsi*; since it appears in a different record, repetition is not a concern. The \"pomegranate seeds\" refer to the common pomegranate.)\n\nYan Qingjia was the ancient Flame Emperor, now the Northern Supreme Emperor and lord of all the world’s ghosts and spirits.\n\n(The Flame Emperor, Shennong, invented agriculture and tasted the hundred herbs—his sagely merit rivaled that of the Yellow Emperor. Yet he should not be the Ghost Emperor. Another *Flame Emperor* was the *Dating* clan defeated by the Yellow Emperor; this is likely the one intended, not Shennong. Moreover, external texts describe Shennong as ox-headed, and in Buddhist depictions, the lord of hell is also ox-headed—this further compounds the uncertainty. The *Four Illuminations Duke* was promoted.)\n\nSince the term of office has its set duration, the ranks and titles of the Supreme Emperor should also be elevated to their utmost. (Though this has already been over three thousand years, perhaps it is like the earthly emperors who remain unchanged while their ministers and assistants are frequently replaced.)\n\nKing Wu of Zhou now serves as the Ghost Official and Lord of the Northern Dipper. (King Wen’s son, King Wu of Zhou, surnamed Ji, named Fa, overthrew King Zhou of Yin and became the Son of Heaven. He reigned for two years before passing. The *Rites* state he lived to ninety-three; the *Bamboo Annals* say forty-five. According to later records, the Four Illuminations Duke was promoted to immortal rank, yet no mention is made of the Lord of the Northern Dipper. Since he is subordinate to the Jade Dawn, he should likewise have been included in the same rank of promotion.)\n\nXia Qi serves as the Eastern Illuminations Duke, leading the Lord of the Dipper’s teachers. (Son of Yu, surnamed *Si*. The *Bamboo Annals* state he reigned for thirty-nine years before his death at seventy-eight. From his collapse until the *jimao* year, it has been exactly two thousand four hundred and twenty-five years. An *An* Controller of Fate states that after two thousand four hundred years in office, he was promoted to fill the Nine Palaces above. By this reckoning, the fourth year of Yuanhui of the Song has already passed.)\n\nKing Wen serves as the Western Illuminations Duke, leading the Northern Emperor’s teachers. (King Wen’s name was Chang. The *Rites* state...)\n\nKing Wen died at ninety-seven. Though both father and son were esteemed for their sagely virtue, they could not escape the ranks of the *guan*-ghosts. While this may be due to the fault of their execution, it must also be because they did not cultivate the Dao of immortality.)\n\nDuke Shao serves as the Southern Illuminations Duke. (Duke Shao’s name was *Jia Baibai*. A bedchamber son of King Wen, he was enfeoffed at Shao and later established as lord of the state of Yan. According to records, the Duke of Zhou, Duke Shao, and the Grand Duke all assisted in the mandate to overthrow Zhou. Yet while the Duke of Zhou’s contributions were unparalleled, among the ranks of immortals and ghosts, none of his deeds stand prominently recorded. The Grand Duke, wielding the battle-axe and staff, enforced punishments with the greatest severity, yet he appears in the *Arrayed Transcendents*. Duke Shao’s virtue flowed like the sweet pear, yet he was instead appointed to a chief ghostly office—such matters remain difficult to fathom. All must stem from the karmic roots of their respective destinies. Among the Six Palaces, King Wen and his sons suddenly occupy three, demonstrating the profound eminence of Zhou’s virtue.)\n\nWu Jizha serves as the Northern Illuminations Duke. (Youngest son of King Shoumeng of Wu and uncle to Helü, he descended from Taibo and also bore the Ji surname. He yielded the throne and dwelt in Yanling, where the present Temple of Jizi stands. Though possessed of benevolent and worthy virtue, he was nonetheless secondary to the earlier sages, yet his case was exceptional. Examining these lords, their promotions have been irregular, for the Dao shifts with the times in its employment of persons. From the era of Xia Qi onward, over two thousand years passed before their ranks were altered—ten times the number of those who serve as lords below the earth. This clarifies the gradations of the immortal hierarchy, hence their exalted and wondrous status.)\n\nThe **Four Illuminations Duke** also had four distinguished guests. Yet these four lords would later all ascend to the immortal ranks.\n\nThe **Four Illuminations Master** commands the ghosts of the four quarters.\n\n*(The four guests—\ntheir deeds appear later.\nMoreover, according to the later *Record of Fixed Announcements*,*\n**Xiao [夹百百]** is the **Eastern Illuminations Duke**, advancing to the **Right Guardian of the Nine Palaces** in the **Upper Complement**. This is proof of the immortal hierarchy, differing from what came before. Since **Qi** has not yet departed, **Xiao** cannot yet attain immortality—likely an error in the text. If it is indeed the **Eastern Illuminations Duke**, then it should still refer to **Qi**. The matter of doubt is addressed later.)*\n\nThe **Western Illuminations Officer** has sixteen attendants, overseeing the blood and grain offerings for the ghosts of the state’s ancestral temples and halls.\n*(These officers should also be subordinate to the **Western Illuminations Duke**. The blood and grain offerings are for those who have received their mandates and hold their posts—not for malevolent spirits clinging to the living.)*\n\n**Zhou [岂页]** served as the **Ghost Official and Commander of the Mandate**. Now, **Dengyi [登邑] Yue** and **Cheng Xia** have succeeded him due to his many misdeeds.\n*(**Zhou [岂页]**, styled **Boren**, was from Ancheng, Ruzhou. After serving Jin and crossing the river, he rose to the rank of **Master of Writing and Attendant**. In the first year of Emperor Yuan’s **Yongchang era**, when Wang Dun marched south, Zhou was seized at the **Stone Head Gate** and killed at age fifty-four. He was posthumously honored as **Light-bearing Marquis** and granted the title **Lord of the Light Office**.\n**Dengyi Yue**, styled **Boshan**, was from Chen Commandery. He distinguished himself in the suppression of Guo Mo.)*\n\n「In the early years of the **Xianning era**, he was appointed as **General Pacifying the South** and **Governor of Guangzhou**. He died of illness in Yuzhou.\n\nLater, **Xin Yuanzi** said that **Dengyi Yue** served as **Chief Military Advisor** to **Xie Youyu**. This must be after his transfer.\n\n**Cheng Xia** succeeded the **Governor of Chen Commandery**, acting as a strategist for **Shi Le**. His sister became Le’s wife. He rose to the rank of **Right Master of Writing and Attendant**, holding the title **Governor of Chen Commandery**. Le was killed by **Shi Hu**.\n\n**West Capital’s** **Court Attendant** **Jia Yi** once failed to properly manage the **Fengshu** affair and was dismissed to guard **Mount Tai**. The **Lord of Mount Tai** recently appointed him as **Chief Military Advisor**, and this was accepted.\n\n**The Gate Keeper of South Gate**. Now, **Zhou Fu** succeeds **Xi Yue** as **Gate Keeper**. One household has two **Gate Keepers**, and there are four **Gate Attendants**. In total, there are eight **Gate Attendants** under the **Heavenly Gate**.\n\nThe **Gate Attendants** are subordinate officials to the **Heavenly Gate Gate Keepers**. This must refer to the **Northern Emperor’s Gate**.\n\n*(Later Han records state: \"The keys to the Southern and Northern Gates belong to one palace, meaning there are two **Heavenly Gates** in total. The **Su Shao** biography mentions there are eight **Gate Attendants**, referring to the divination of **Yan Yuan** and **Bu Shang**. Now we see them holding office, so perhaps this is not the case.\")*\n\n**Zhou Fu**, courtesy name **Dao He**, was from Chai Sang in Xunyang. He was the son of Zhou Fang. Initially, he served as a general under Wang Dun. When Dun marched east to attack the capital, the campaign failed, and Zhou Fu fled with **Xi Yue** into the lands of the Western Yang barbarians. After Dun’s execution, he was again appointed as a general to suppress Su Jun. Later, he conquered Shu and pacified Li Shi, receiving the title **Marquis of Jiancheng**. He was then made **General Pacifying the West** and **Governor of Yizhou**. This was when he was about thirty years old. He died of illness in the third year of Xingning. He was posthumously honored as **General Pacifying the West**, and his posthumous title was **Xiang Gong**.\n\n**Xi Yue**, courtesy name **Dao Wei**, was from Gaoping. He was the son of **Xin Yin**. In the first year of Yongchang, he led the various displaced peoples to cross the Yangtze into the eastern lands. Later, he helped suppress and defeat Wang Dun, receiving the title **Marquis of Gaoping**. He was then appointed **Grand General of Chariots and Cavalry** and **Governor of Dui Zhou**, garrisoning Guangling. He later garrisoned Xuzhou. After Su Jun was pacified, he was made **Sifang** and his title changed to **Marquis of Nanchang**. He still garrisoned Jingzhao City. He died of illness in the fifth year of Xiankang, at the age of seventy-one. He was posthumously honored as **Grand Master**, and his posthumous title was **Wencheng Gong**.\n\n**The Northern Dipper** governs the **Heavenly Gate Gate Keeper**. Now, this refers to **Zang Hong**, who succeeded **Wei Qiao**. Another person is **Wang Bo**, newly appointed. *(This is also the South Gate. The remaining four are the Four Bright Gate Keepers, who should also correspond to the Four Bright Gates. None of them are prominent.)*\n\nZang Hong, courtesy name Zǐyuán, was a man of broad-minded virtue and moral integrity from Sheyang, Guangling. In the late Han dynasty, he raised an army to overthrow Dong Zhuo. Later, he served as the **Taishou (太守)** of Qingzhou and Dong Commandery. He betrayed Yuan Shao, who besieged and surrounded him; when his supplies ran out, he was captured and executed.\n\nWei Qiao, courtesy name Jìmèng, was a native of Tianshui. He possessed both talent and virtue, and people naturally gathered around him. In the late Eastern Han dynasty, he seized control of Longxi and declared himself king. In the first year of Jianwu (建武), Emperor Guangwu launched an expedition against him. Wei Qiao, driven by resentment and starvation, died of illness.\n\nWang Bo was a man from Bohai. Jin Shangshu Jin Shi had talent and ability. He defected to Shi Hu and became **Zhongshu Sheng (中書監)**. *(He was later killed.)*\n\nJi Shàn originally served as **Fuhé Jiāngjūn (抚河将军)** and **Sima (司马)**. Now, he holds the position of **North Heavenly Gate Gate Keeper (北天修门郎)** and succeeds Tian Lù. Ji Shàn and Yu Tan take turns guarding the **Heavenly Gate (天门)** for one day each. *(The North Heavenly Gate corresponds to the North Emperor’s Gate.)* Ji Shàn, courtesy name Sīyuǎn, was from Jùróng, Danyang. He first served in Wu as **Zhōngláng Jiāngjūn (中郎将)**. After Wu’s fall, he returned to Luoyang and was recommended as a **Xiùcái (秀才)**. He gradually rose in rank to become **Taishou (太守) of Kuàijì (会稽)**, then **Shìzhōng (侍中)**, Shangshu (尚書), Púyè (仆射), and **Piàojì Jiāngjūn (骠骑将军)**. He died of illness in the third year of Tàiníng, at the age of seventy-two. He was posthumously honored as **Kāifú (开府)**.\n\nTian Lù was posthumously honored with the title **Mù Hóu (穆侯)**. During the reign of **Arcu Wu (魏武帝)**, he served as **Cāngūn (参军)** under **Chéng Rìlì (程日立)**. Later, he became **Taishou (太守) of Héjiān (河间)**. He rebelled and was defeated by **Yán Ròu (阎柔)**.\n\nYu Tan, courtesy name **Sī'ǎo (思奥)**, was from **Yúyáo, Kuàijì (会稽余姚)**. He was the grandson of **Yu (虞) [Mào] [Fān]**. His rank rose to **Yì Jiāngjūn (卫将军)**, **Yòu Guānglù (右光禄)**, **Kāifú (开府)**, and **Wǔchāng Hóu (武昌侯)**. In the eighth year of **Xiányáng (咸阳)**, he died of illness at the age of seventy. He was posthumously honored as **Guānglù (光禄)** and given the title **Xiàoliè Hóu (孝列侯)**.\n\n**Jīndāo (金刀)**, who led the title of **Lúshān Hóu (庐山侯)**, was courtesy named **Jūn Sī (君思)** and hailed from **Kuàijì (会稽)**. He served under **Jìn Chéng Mù Gōng (晋成穆公)** as **Zǔ Chángshì (左长史)** and **Dānyáng Yīn (丹阳尹)**. He later became **Zuǒ Mín Shàngshū (左民尚书)** and **Píngshòu Hóu (平寿侯)**. In the seventh year of **Yǒnghé (永和)**, he died of illness.\n\nGù Hé, after returning from garrison duty in **Liáodōng (辽东)**, was dismissed from service. The **North Emperor (北帝)** then appointed him as **Zhí Gài Làng (执盖郎)**. **Fàn Míng (范明)**, who had been **Zhí Gài Làng**, was promoted to **Diǎn Bǐng Hóu (典柄侯)**.\n\nGù Hé, courtesy name **Jūn Xiào (君孝)**, was from **Wú Jùn (吴郡)**. Orphaned young, he possessed resolve and integrity. He served the **Jìn (晋)** as **Shìbù Shìlàng (吏部侍郎)**, **Yùshǐ Zhōngchéng (御史中丞)**, **Shìbù Shàngshū (吏部尚书)**, **Lǐngjūn (领军)**, **Shàngshū Bùyè (尚书仆射)**, and **Shàngshū Lìng (尚书令)**.\n\nIn the seventh year of **Yǒnghé (永和)**, he died of illness, at the age of sixty-four. He was posthumously honored as **Zhìzhōng Shìtú (赠侍中司徒)** and granted the title **Mù Gōng (谥穆公)**. *[The text in brackets is unclear.]*\n\n**Fàn Míng (范明)**, whose name was recorded in the *Han* as **Fàn Míng Yǒu (范明友)**, may not have been the same person. *[The text in brackets is unclear.]*\n\nWhen the **North Emperor (北帝)** summoned **Xǔ Shìxiānsheng (许先生)** for a test, he was referred to as **Diǎn Bǐng Hóu Zhōu Páng (典柄侯周鲂)**. *[The text in brackets is unclear.]*\n**Zhōu Páng (周鲂)**, courtesy name **Zǐyú (字子鱼)**, was from **Yángxián (阳羡)** in **Wú Jùn (吴郡)**. He was the father of **Zhōu Chù (周处)**. Serving under **Wú (吴)**, he held the post of **Tàishǒu (太守)** of **Fǎn Yì (番邑)**—later known as **Yáng (阳)**—and was renowned for his **wēihuì (威惠)**. **Yán Báihǔ (严白虎)**, also from **Wú Jùn (吴郡)**, had gathered crowds in the mountains during **Sūn Cè’s (孙策)** time. When **Cè (策)** pursued him, he fled and died in **Yúháng (余杭)**. His younger brother was named **Yú (舆)**, equally brave and strong. **Cè (策)** feigned a meeting with him, and he was killed by a spear thrust.\n\n**Yīn Hào (殷浩)**, courtesy name **Yuānyuán (渊源)**, was from **Chángpíng (长平)** in **Chénliú (陈留)**. In the early years of **Kāng Dì’s (康帝)** reign, he was appointed **Shìshì (刺史)** of **Yángzhōu (扬州)**. In the sixth year of **Yǒnghé (永和)**, he was promoted to **Zhōngjūn Jiāngjūn (中军将军)** and **Dūdū Wǔzhōu (都督五州)**, leading a northern expedition against **Yáo Xiāng (姚襄)**. Though defeated, he was later removed by **Guàn Wēn (桓温)**, exiled to **Dōngyáng (东阳)**, and perished in the twelfth year of **Yǒnghé (永和)** from distress, at the age of sixty-four. Skilled in **tántǔn (谭论)**, he later engaged in debate with **Hé Yàn (何晏)**. **Yàn (晏)**, courtesy name **Píngshū (平叔)**, was the grandson of **Hé Jìn (何进)**. Proficient in **xiānlǐ (玄理)**, he rose to the rank of **Zhìzhōng Shàngshū (侍中尚书)** but was implicated in the **Cáo Shuǎng (曹爽)** faction and executed by **Sīmǎ Xuānwáng (司马宣王)**.\n\n**Wēn Táizhēn (温太真)**, courtesy name **Shānjiāo (山乔)**, was appointed **Jiāng Hǎi Guó Bó (监海开国伯)** and governed **Dōnghǎi (东海)**. He later recruited **Dù Yù (杜预)** as his **Chángshì (长史)**, granting him a rank comparable to that of a **Dàjiāngjūn Chángshì (大将军长史)**. **Wēn (温)**, from **Qí (祁)** in **Tàiyuān (太原)**, served under **Jìn (晋)** as **Píngnán Jiāngjūn (平南将军)** and **Shìshì (刺史)** of **Jiāngzhōu (江州)**, suppressing **Sū Jǔn (苏峻)**. He attained the position of **Piāoqí Jiāngjūn Kāifú (骠骑将军开府)** and was ennobled as **Shǐwǔ Gōng (始五公)**. He died of illness in the fourth year of **Xiānhé (咸和)**, at the age of forty-two, and was posthumously honored as **Zhìzhōng Dàjiāngjūn (赠太将军)** and granted the title **Zhōngwǔ Gōng (中武公)**.\n\n**Dù Yù (杜预)**, courtesy name **Fú Kǎi (符凯)**, was from **Dùlíng (杜陵)** in **Jīngzào (京兆)**. He was well-versed in knowledge and strategy, having annotated the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. Entering service under **Jìn (晋)**, he began as **Shàngshū Làng (尚书郎)** and eventually became **Dūdū Jīngzhōu (都督荆州)** and **Zhènyáng (镇襄阳)**. He contributed to the conquest of **Wú (吴)** and was ennobled as **Dāngyáng Hóu (当阳侯)**. In the fifth year of **Tàikāng (太康)**, he returned to **Luò (洛)** and died of illness in **Dēng Yì (登邑)** County, at the age of sixty-three. He was buried in **Luòyáng (洛阳)** and posthumously honored as **Zhìzhōng Zhēngnán Dàjiāngjūn (征南大将军)**. His title was **Chéng Hóu (谥成侯)**.\n\n**Hé Cìdào (何次道)**, whose given name was **Chōng (充)**, was from **Jiāngqián (庐江潜)**. He held the rank of **Shàngshū Lìng Piāoqí Jiāngjūn (尚书令骠骑将军)** and was later appointed **Yángzhōu Shìshì (扬州刺史)** and **Lù Shàngshū (录尚书)**, assisting in the governance of the **Zhèngshì (正世业)**. Devoted to **Fó (佛)**, he frequently practiced **shīhuì (施惠)** and established **gōngdé (功德)**. He was always engaged in **shànshì (善事)**. *[The text in brackets is unclear.]*\n*(Later, **Xīn Xiāozǐ (辛玄子)** also spoke of such matters.)\n\nIn the second year of **Yǒnghé (永和)**, on the **wùyín (戊寅)** day of the first month, he died of illness at the age of fifty-five. He was posthumously honored as **Sīgōng (司空)**, with the title **Wénmù Gōng (文穆公)**. According to this decree, he held a **guǐzhí zázhì (鬼职杂位)**—though not the **Sìmíng Gōng (四明公)**, he still received the transformation in the **Zhūfú Gōng (朱火宫)** and ascended to the rank of **xiān pǐn (仙品)**. This must be the result of profound **virtue/power (功德)**.\n\n**Wèi Wǔdì (魏武帝)**, as **Běijūn Tàifǔ (北君太傅)**, served under the **Běijūn (北君)**—the **Běidǒu Jūn (北斗君)**, who is also **Zhōu Wǔwáng (周武王)**. Since each **Sìmíng (四明)** has its own **bīnyǒu (宾友)**, there was fear that the **Běidǒu Jūn** might not establish this office. Thus, it was decreed that **Wèi Wǔdì Cáo Cāo (魏武帝曹操)**, a native of **Péi Guó (沛国)**, from the **Yánjiāo (言焦)** clan, would be appointed to this role. A hero who **bá luàn (拨乱)** and **kuāngdìng (匡定)** the world, he was封封 as **Wèi Wáng (魏王)** and granted the **jiǔxí (九锡)**. He died of illness in the first month of **Jiàn’ān 25 (建安二十五年)**, at the age of sixty-six. That same year, in the tenth month, **Wèi Wén (魏文)** received the **shàn (禅)**, and he was posthumously honored as **Tàizǔ Wǔ Huángdì (太祖武皇帝)**.\n\nThe rest cannot be fully recounted. After all, the affairs of **guǐshén (鬼神)** are not meant to be revealed to the world.\n\nThis is what **Xuān Gōng (荀公)**—that is, **Xuàn Zhōnghóu (荀中侯)**—said. Having been enrolled under **Sīmìng (司命)** and overseeing all **guǐguān (鬼官)**, he knew these matters thoroughly. However, his account is disjointed, with events interspersed and seemingly answered as questions arise, rather than presented in a natural sequence. Since most people doubt the existence of the **yōumíng guǐshén (幽冥鬼神)**, he warned against revealing these matters, lest they invite **suspicion and slander**, thereby causing further loss.\n\nThe preceding section does not record the year or month. When **Wáng Yìshǎo (王逸少)** later examined the records of **Wáng Xī (王羲)**, it was determined that this likely occurred in the year **yǐchǒu (乙丑)**.\n\nWhen a person lies in bed, the head must be raised high.\nIf raised high, the earthly *qi* will not reach upward,\nand the ghosts will not blow upon them.\nThe *qi* of ghosts invading humans\nalways ascends from the earth below.\n\nGhosts—being yin in nature—\noften rely on objects to disperse their *qi*.\nThey may attach to humans or beasts,\ncling to vessels or utensils,\nor lodge in food and drink,\nonly then unleashing their malevolence.\nOnce, a sick man lying on the ground\nsaw a ghost at the foot of his bed,\nusing its hand as a pipe to blow upon him—\nthis is the act of ghostly blowing.\n\nWhen lying in a chamber,\none must keep it clean and well-ordered.\nIf clean and well-ordered, it receives pure *qi*;\nif not, it receives impure *qi*.\nImpure *qi* disrupting a chamber\nwill cause undertakings to fail\nand actions to collapse.\nEven one’s own body—\nmust be washed and bathed in purity.\nOtherwise, there is no hope.\n\nFor ghosts and spirits are dust and turbidity incarnate,\nand these things follow human wickedness.\nSince they are restless and lack mastery,\nhow could the Dao be discussed?\n\nDo not speak of the Dao while studying it.\nIf one speaks of the Dao while studying it,\nghosts will assail them,\nand their undertakings will fail,\ncausing illness—\nfor their essence is not yet true.\n\n(*The True Instructments* often warn against this:\nEvery word and deed, if revealed, diminishes one’s *ling* [灵].\nHow much more so for sickness?\nWhat is called \"transcendent\" is achieved through sincere practice—\nwhy seek to speak of it?\nDemons lurk, ever watchful,\nlike echoes and shadows.)\n\nShān Shìyěn, after receiving the teachings of Master Mèng,\nwould lie down in the evening,\nfirst reciting the *Huángtíng Nèijǐng Jīng* once before sleeping,\nso that his soul and spirit might refine themselves.\nIf one practices this Dao for twenty-one years, they will become transcendent—\nthis is the fulfillment of ten thousand offenses.\nEven three or four recitations are beneficial.\nLady Jiāng of Běiyuè said:\nReading this scripture also keeps one free of illness—\nthis is the Dao of immortality.\n\n(These four principles are all worthy of adoption.\nTheir details are separately transcribed in the Third Section.)\n\nMaster Mèng—this refers to the gentleman Mèng from Jīngzhào.\nWhen it comes to practice, it is best to follow Zhèng Chéng’s method.\nIn the previous section, there was mention of Lady Jiāng of Xīyue.\nNow, the *Huǒtiān Xià* [Scripture] speaks again of Běiyue.\nI am uncertain whether these are two separate individuals,\nor if this is an error in transcription.\n\nAt night, one should habitually grind their teeth.\nThere is no fixed limit to how often this should be done.\nGhostly evils and malevolent spirits always fear the sound of grinding teeth—\nthus, they cannot harm a person.\nIf one combines this with rinsing the mouth and reciting incantations,\nthe result is even better.\n(For those who strike their teeth [in ritual], their spirit is preserved—\nthus, ghostly evils cannot interfere.\nNow, those who practice the higher Dao\nconstantly strike their teeth day and night—\nthis is why they can achieve longevity.)\n\nIn the past, there was a man named Báozhù from Jìběi.\n(His name is obscure; it does not appear in external records.)\nHe never studied the Dao.\nNor did he know magical techniques.\nAt the age of over forty,\nhe suddenly contracted *miànfēng* [a wind-related facial disorder].\nHis mouth and eyes became misaligned.\nWhen he opened his mouth, his upper and lower teeth would repeatedly strike against each other,\nproducing a loud sound.\nThis condition persisted day and night without cessation.\n\nHe lived to the age of one hundred and twenty-seven.\nLater, he encountered an extreme cold snap and fell into the River of Longevity, drowning.\nThe Northern Sovereign’s officials also dispatched ghosts and calamity-demons of the sun to seize him,\nyet these demons never dared approach him.\nThe Ghostly Bureau inquired as to why.\nThe Celestial replied:\n*\"This man was skilled in many magical arts,\nby which he constrained us.\nHe habitually struck his teeth,\nmimicking the thunderous beat of heavenly drums,\nto awaken the spirits within his body.\nThe spirits dared not scatter,\nand the ghostly *qi* could not penetrate.\nThus, he had no fateful connection to be taken.\"*\n\nBy this reasoning, had Báozhù not crossed the icy river,\nhe might well have lived beyond a thousand years.\nInstead, during the severe cold, he walked upon the ice,\nhis mouth closed and unable to strike his teeth again—\nthus, the ghosts seized him while he drowned in the river.\n\nEven those afflicted with *miànfēng* whose teeth chatter uncontrollably\nstill repel death and ward off ghosts—\nhow much more so for a Daoist adept who deliberately strikes his teeth,\nsounds the heavenly drums,\nand fully invigorates his bodily spirits!\n\n(The Daoist alchemical text states:\n*\"Constantly swallowing saliva and striking the teeth\nshortens one’s lifespan.\"*\nYet by this very account...)\n\nHuman life has no fixed limit—\nall that exists is premature death.\nIf one cultivates the Dao with diligence,\nlike Báozhù striking his teeth,\nwhy should one not attain eternal years?\nThe true peril lies in occasional slackness,\nwhen one is then seized by ghosts—\nperishing like one drowned in the river.\n\nAs for all ghosts, they lack true wisdom;\nthey rely on wind-illness as their craft—\nhow could they overcome such folly?\n\n---\nIn the **Doushan** [都山] realm,\ntrees, waters, and marshes resemble those of the mortal world.\nYet its rice grains are no larger than millet,\ntasting like water chestnuts.\nThe other four grains are not so.\nOnly rice is called *Chóngsī* [重思]—\na name of great significance.\n\nDu Qióng composed the *Ode to Chóngsī* [重思赋]:\n*\"Spring’s soft mist unfurls—\nlush and verdant, the sacred grain.\nThe divine canopy spreads,\ntimely blessings for the people’s feast.\nThe four seasons’ harvests rejoice,\nofferings made to the gods of grain.\nThe holy ears rise in abundance,\ntheir vast stalks bending my dark hall.\nHere, auspicious signs appear—\nthe Emperor’s radiance shines forth.\nThis is what is spoken of.\"*\n\n(Here, it further speaks of **Doushan’s** affairs,\nyet again returning to *Chóngsī*.\nIt says that those who worship the *Zhuren* [祝人]\nmust not partake in sacrificial feasting—\nfor this is the very act of offering to the Daoist officials, as previously stated.\nMoreover, when a ghost’s lifespan is fulfilled,\nit receives the remaining years of its host,\nand upon death, sacrificial rites are held in its honor.)\n\nDu Qióng, styled **Bóyú** [伯瑜],\na scholar from Shu [蜀],\nwas well-versed in learning and possessed literary talent.\nHe annotated the *Book of Songs* and mastered divination.\nHe could recall the events of the Wei dynasty as if they were contemporary,\nand served under Liu Bei’s regime as **Honglu [鸿胪]** and **Taichang [太常]**.\nHe died in the **Yanxi [延熙] era’s** thirteenth year,\nhaving lived past eighty.\n\nEight attendants served the Emperor at dawn:\nXu Shu, **Guanglong [广龙]**, Yuán Yú, Li Guang,\nWang Jia, Hé Yàn, Jié Jié, and Yīn Hào—\nall like the **Shizhong [侍中]** of the mortal world.\n\n(Li Guang, the **Xiáqí General [骁骑将军]** under Emperor Wu,\nwas accused by officials during his campaign against the Xiongnu.)\n\nXīn Guì [心貴] sighed and slit his own throat to die.\nWang Jia, a man of Shu Commandery,\nserved as a **Lángzhōng [郎中]** under Emperor Píng.\nBy the time of Wang Máng [王莽],\nhe abandoned his post and returned to his homeland,\nrefusing to submit to Sun Shù [孙述].\nHe died, sword in hand.\n\nXu Shu, styled **Fúzhí [符直]**\nof Yǐngchuān [颖川],\nrecommended Zhuge Liang to Liu Bei.\nLater, when Wei Wu [魏武] captured his mother,\nhe surrendered to the Wei.\nHe rose to the rank of **Zhōngchéng [中丞]**.\nIn the **Dàhé [大和]** era of Emperor Ming,\nhe died of illness.\n\nGuanglong [廣龍] Dé, styled **Lìngmíng [令明]**\nof Nán’ān [南安],\nfollowed Zhang Zhen [張鎮] in surrendering to Wei Wu.\nHe was appointed **Lìyì Jiāngjūn [立義将军]**\nand stationed at Fánchéng [樊城],\nbut was slain by Guan Yu.\nHe was posthumously honored as **Dú Hóu [杜侯]**\nand buried in **Yèyì [業邑]**\nwith his head and body intact, as if alive.\n\nYuán Yú, styled **Shìdū [世都]**\nof Píyáng [濮陽],\nwas eloquent and skilled in arts and techniques.\nHe served under Jin Wu [晉武],\nwas summoned to the **Sītú [司徒]** Wei Shu’s [魏舒] household,\nand reached the position of **Shìzhōng [侍中] Zhōngshū Shìng [中書令]**.\nJié Jié, styled **Zìlián [稚連]**\nof Jǐnán [濟南],\nwas his younger brother.\nHe once served under Jin as **Huángmén Shìláng [黃門侍郎] Zhōngchéng [中丞] Jīngyù Zhōuzhìshǐ [荊豫州刺史] Shàngshū [尚書]**.\nDuring the reign of Zhao Wang Lún [趙王倫],\nhe was killed by Sun Xiù [孙秀].\n\nHé and Yīn [何、殷], the two mentioned earlier,\nwere of the eight who served before—\nonly Dào [道] and Dé [德] remain.\nNow I must ask further:\nWho are these four who serve at dawn?\n\nAmong them are **Sìmíng Gōng [四明公]** and **Běidǒu Jūn [北斗君]**.\nThey are like the five who serve at dawn—\nthe eight from before were merely officials under the Northern Great Emperor.\nTheir selection and use were also the same.\n\n(The title *sìdì chén* [侍帝晨] also applies to the *xiān guān* [仙官].\nBoth hold the rank of *shìzhōng* [侍中].\nThis passage states their selection and use were identical—\nwhether it means only their titles and positions,\nor evaluating their talent and insight while also considering their merits and virtue,\nis unclear.\nThese individuals’ talents and stations\nwere forever unlike one another.\nPerhaps in the **Yōutú** [幽途] they are distinguished differently.)\n\nThere are also four **Zhōngláng Zhíshì [中郎直事]**, akin to the **Shàngshū [尚書]** of the mortal world:\nDài Yuān, Gōngsūn Dù [公孙度],\nLiú Fēng, and Guō Jiā.\nNow they are seen in office—\nLiú Fēng was the adopted son of Xuán Dé [玄德].\n(This office should be the **Tàidì Lǐngliáo [太帝領僚]**, now equivalent to the *sàncáo shàngshū* [散曹尚書].\nDài Yuān, styled **Ruòyú [若愚]**\nof Guǎnglíng [廣陵],\nserved under Jin, advancing through the ranks to **Hùjūn Shàngshū [护军尚书]**, **Pūshè [仆射]**, and **Piáojì Jiāngjūn [骠骑将军]**.)\n\nGuō Jiā.\n\nWith Zhou [Yè] together perished at the hands of Wang Dun.\nHe was posthumously honored as *Guānglù* [光禄], and his posthumous title was *Jiǎn Hóu* [简侯].\n\nPublic Sun Du, styled **Shūjì** [叔济], was of Liaodong.\nHe was the ancestor of Yuān.\nInitially, he served as Governor of Liaodong.\nDuring the *Jiàn’ān* era, he usurped the throne and proclaimed himself king,\nestablishing imperial insignia and passing the *zhuànguó* [传国] heir to his son, Kāng.\nHis grandson, Yuān, was captured by Sīmǎ Xuānwáng [司马宣王].\n\n**Liú Fēng**, originally of the Kòu clan of Luóhóu [罗侯],\nwas the adopted son of Liu Bei when the latter had no heir.\nBy nature fierce and bold, he possessed strength, martial skill, and qi.\nLater, he was granted a command and executed.\nThis was a case of an outsider inheriting the surname—\nyet he still managed to assume the lineage.\n\n**Guō Jiā**, styled **Fèngxiào** [奉孝],\nwas from Yǐngchuān Yǔ [颖川阳翟].\nA strategist for Wéiwǔ, he served as *jūn móu jìjiào* [军谋祭酒].\nHe died of illness at thirty-eight.\nHis posthumous title was *Zhēn Hóu* [真侯].\n\n**Xuán Dé** now holds the title *Běihé Hóu* [北河侯],\nruling alongside Hàn Suì.\nHe is now under the *Xiān Guān* [仙官].\n(The *Xiān Guān* also includes the *Běihé Sīmìng Jìn Bǎo Hóu* [北河司命禁保侯],\nwho oversees matters of the Three Officials [Sān Guān],\nbelonging to the *Dōnghuá Guān* [东华官], led by the *Bǎomìng Jūn* [保命君].\nThis must mean the *Běihé Hóu* is subordinate to them.)\n\n**Liú Bèi**, styled **Xuán Dé**, was of his native commandery.\nHe first raised an army in rebellion,\nlater seizing Shu and assuming imperial titles.\nAfter three years, he died of illness at sixty-three.\nHis posthumous title was *Zhāoliè Huángdì* [昭烈皇帝].\nAt the time, he was one of the Three Sovereigns alongside Wéiwǔ Sūn Céng.\nThough his rank was low, being under the *Xiān Guān*,\nhis merit may yet compare favorably.\n\n**Hàn Suì**, styled **Wén Jiǎo** [文纣],\nwas from [omitted].\nAt the end of the Han, he led armies and sowed chaos in the western lands.\nIn the twenty-fifth year of *Jiàn’ān*, Wéiwǔ launched a campaign against him.\nSuì fled to Jīnchéng, where he was killed by his own generals, including **Móu Yǎn** [麴演].\nThough bold and fierce, he could not escape calamity—\nyet he was granted the honor of serving alongside Liu Bei in the *Xiān Guān*,\nfurther elevated in rank.\n\nThere are also two *Dà Jìn Chén* [大禁晨], equivalent to the *Shàngshū Lìng* [尚书令].\nThese were held by Hàn Guāngwǔ and Sūn Wéntái.\n(Hàn Guāngwǔ, Liu Xiù, styled **Wénshū** [文叔],\nwas the eighth-generation descendant of the High Ancestor.\nHe raised armies to overthrow Wang Mang and the Chìmǐ,\npacifying the realm.)\n\nThe emperor reigned for thirty-three years before dying of illness at the age of sixty-three.\n\nSūn Jiān, styled **Wén Tái** [文台], was a native of Wú Commandery. He was the father of Sūn Quán. Clǎn Shù recommended him as the *Pò Lǔ Jiāngjūn Yùzhōu Shìshǐ* [破虏将军豫州刺史], leading the campaign against Dòng Zhuō. Later, he attacked Liú Biǎo. In the second year of *Chūpíng*, he was killed by an archer under the command of Liú Biǎo’s general, Huáng Zǔ, at the age of thirty-seven. Though loyal and valiant, his station was humble, yet he now shares rank with the Son of Heaven—much like Hàn Suì’s parallel with Guāndì [玄德].\n\nThere were also two *Zhōng Jìn Chén* [中禁晨], equivalent to today’s *Zhōngshū Lìng* [中书令] and overseer. These were held by **Yán Huái** and **Yáng Biāo**. Huái’s style was **Sī Jì** [思季], and Biāo’s was **Wén Xiān** [文先].\n\n(Yán Huái, styled **Sī Jì**, was a man whose worth was yet to be fully realized. Yáng Biāo, styled **Wén Xiān**, hailed from Hóngnóng. He was the father of Yáng Xíu, the Han *Sīkōng* [司空]. During the chaos of Dòng Zhuō’s rebellion, he supported and protected the Emperor Xiàndì. In times of peril, east and west, he endured three terms of office until his death in the sixth year of *Wéiwén Huángchū* [魏文黄初], at the age of eighty-four. The *Xù Zhǎngshì* [许长史]’s son now holds the title of *Dànfāng Hóu* [弹方侯]. There were two *Dànfāng Hóu*—one overseeing the south, the other the north. The *Xù Zhǎngshì* served as the *Nán Dànfāng Hóu*, with Liú Zàn as his *Sīmǎ* [司马]. Bào Yuànlì [鲍员力] was the *Běi Dànfāng Hóu*, with Wéi Zhūn as his *Sīmǎ*. Each commanded the keys to the southern and northern gates, with Xù leading a thousand soldiers of the southern command and Bào commanding a thousand of the northern. Their primary duty was to guard the gates and apprehend offenders. This resembles today’s *Yǔlín Jiān* [羽林监], with southern and northern forces akin to the Daoist *Tiāndīng Lìshì* [天丁力士] and armored troops.)\n\n(The two *Zhōng Jìn Chén* and the southern and northern *Dànfāng Hóu* were likely also officials under the *Běidì* [北帝]. At the time of this record, it may have been customary to invoke the name *Xù* [许], though it is possible Yáng [杨] himself was not dismissive of him. The *Běidì* incantation’s reference to \"threatening the south and north\" pertains to these troops, who were surely valiant warriors.)\n\nThe *Xù* lineage’s deeds are recorded in another chapter.\n\n**Liǔ Zàn**, courtesy name *Zhèngmíng*, hailed from Chángshān in Kuàijī. As a youth, he served as a county clerk, devoured military texts, and harbored grand ambitions. When he struck down Yellow Turban rebels, he injured his foot—so severely that one leg became permanently bent. He then severed his own tendon to restore its function. Later, he became Left Protector-General. While campaigning with Sūn Jǔn against Huáinán, he fell ill before reaching the front and was slain by Wèi’s general Jiǎng Bān. He was seventy-three years old.\n\n**Bào** *Chūyè* (courtesy name *Shùyè*), descendant of the ninth generation of Bào Xuān, was the son of Bào Xìn. Renowned for his integrity and noble conduct, he served as Middle Regulator and Yellow Gate Attendant during the *Jiàn’ān* era of the Han. Under Wén Dì of Wèi, he held the post of Grand Historian. Though he repeatedly remonstrated against imperial decrees, he was demoted to Chief of Documents and Law. Later, he was executed.\n\n**Wèi Zūn**, courtesy name *Gōngyì*, was from Wù. He was the grandson of Wèi Zhāo, a man of vast learning and literary talent, skilled in calligraphy. During the reign of Jìn’s *Chéng Mù*, he served as Left Minister of Civil Affairs, Yellow Gate Attendant, and Secretary of State. He succeeded Wáng Yìshào as Governor of Línchuān Prefecture, but died in mourning for his mother at the age of sixty-four.\n\n「孙策 was the guest and friend of the Eastern Command Prince. (The eldest son of Sun Jian, courtesy name Bó Fú, he inherited his father’s forces at the end of the Han and first pacified the Jiangdong region. Then he sought to stabilize the central lands of China, was appointed to lead an expedition against the rebel general, and was ennobled as the Marquis of Wú. While crossing the Yangtze River with a light cavalcade, he was struck by an arrow from an enemy. His wound festered and he died at the age of twenty-six. His younger brother Quán succeeded him in his duties. Later, he was posthumously honored as the Duke of Chángshā. Initially, when Sun Jian set out from the east, he saw a lucky omen of seven thousand soldiers. Later, when he looked in a mirror, he saw this same omen again, which enraged him. Thus, his wound broke out and he died. His martial prowess surpassed that of Xiàng Yǔ’s descendants, yet none could claim the title of king—only Sun Jian remained unparalleled in obscurity. Hence, through the ages, it was said that he was the King of the Ten Mountains of Wúxīng, forever dwelling in the prefectural hall. So the prefects dared not ascend, and those who did invariably died. A separate temple was also erected in his honor, where he was invoked as the **Conqueror King** [霸王].)\n\n**True Edicts** [《真诰》] Volume Fifteen. **True Edicts** Volume Sixteen. **Elucidating the Profound and Mysterious** [《阐幽微》] Second Section.

In the Wei, he served as Grand General and Grand Tutor. In Jiāpíng’s third year, he died of illness at seventy-two. Posthumously honored as Prince of Xiàngguó, with the temple name Xuānwén Hóu. Emperor Wǔ of Jin received the Mandate of Heaven and posthumously conferred the title of High Ancestor Xuānhuángdì.)\n\nXún [or variant] as the Northern Bright Prince’s guest and friend.\n(Xún [or variant], courtesy name Wénruò, of Yǐngchuān. In the late Han of Wǔ, he served as Grand Secretary. Possessing noble bearing and discernment, he initially became a strategist for Wèi Wǔ, intending to stabilize the Han dynasty. Suspected and fearful, he took poison and died at fifty. Posthumously honored as Jìng Hóu, with the posthumous title of Tàiyǔ. Among the guests and friends, his standing was akin to that of the Yánlíng match. Though his Four Bright rank was not inferior, his virtue and prestige were indeed superior.)\n\nAmong them, those whose ancestral fate had accumulated hidden virtue and mercy—\nAt their time, they were directly appointed to celestial offices,\nOr entered the Southern Palace to receive transformation,\nWithout regard to their earthly rank.\n\nThe extent of one’s sins and merits in life\nIs weighed and judged accordingly.\nGenerally, those who practiced hidden virtue,\nWho showed great compassion for the destitute and afflicted,\nWere swiftly summoned to the Southern Palace to become immortals.\n\n(Those who in life performed hidden deeds of virtue and profound merit,\nWho cherished the Dao and believed in immortality—\nTheir rewards varied in depth and weight,\nThus their retributions were not all the same.\nSome attained earthly immortality and did not die.\nSome departed through corpse dissolution, leaving their forms behind.\nSome, after death, entered the Cavern Palaces to study.\nSome first went to the Vermilion Fire Palace to refine their forms.\nSome first became lords of the underworld before ascending in rank.\nSome first passed through the Ghostly Bureau before being transformed.\nSome could not depart in life, but their merit extended to their descendants.)\n\nThose who in life were granted the Dao and thus plucked away to transcendence—\nAll

He rose to the rank of **Shìzhōng Tàiyè** (Chief Counselor and Grand Tutor),\n**Dūdū Shíbā Zhōu Jīngjiāng Èr Zhōu Shìshǐ** (Superintendent of Eight Commands, Upriver and Downriver Regions),\nand **Chángshā Gōng** (Duke of Changsha).\nIn the fourth year of the *Xiánhé* era, he returned to Changsha\nand died at **Fánxī** (樊溪) at the age of seventy-six.\nHe was posthumously honored as **Dà Sīmǎ** (Grand Commander-in-Chief),\nwith the posthumous title **Huán Gōng** (Marquis Huán).\n\n**Guǎngyú Liàng** (广臾亮) succeeded him.\nYet, **Guō Chángxiáng** (郭长翔) in his *Língyǔ* (灵语) stated:\n*\"Táo Gōng* (Lord Tao) was indeed exiled for his crimes and had not yet been reinstated.\"\nAnother record states:\n*\"After Táo Gōng’s death, a short time later, his spirit sent a messenger to deliver a message,\npassed down to his son, who said:\n'The Duke of Changsha and I once conversed in heaven about matters of fate.\nThat is why you now know.\nAt that time, Guǎngyú was still alive.\nHe died three or four years later.'*\n\n**Téng Hán** (滕含), son of **Téng Bìng** (滕并), was from **Nányáng Xī È** (南阳西鄂).\nDuring the *Yǒnghé* era, he served as **Píngnán Jiāngjūn** (General Pacifying the South) and **Guǎngzhōu Shìshǐ** (Governor of Guangzhou).\nHe died of illness in the province and was posthumously honored as **Dài Hóu** (Marquis Dai).\n\nTáo Kàn, due to his own merits and status, was further elevated.\n**Xú Níng** (徐宁), styled **Ānqī** (安期),\nwas from **Dōnghǎi** (东海), a descendant of **Xiàn Zhī** (羡之).\nInitially recommended by **Huán Yí** (桓彝),\nhe served alongside **Guǎngyú Liàng** (广臾亮) as **Hùfū Gōngcáo** (Functionary of Military Affairs).\nThey were renowned as *\"the clear scholars of the Eastern Seas and Tai Mountains.\"*\nLater, he rose to the rank of **Zhèngyuán Lìbù Láng** (Regular Official of the Civil Office Department),\n**Guànjūn Jiāngzhōu Shùnyáng Jiǎnhòu** (General of the Vanguard, Marquis of Shunyang in Jiangzhou).\nIn his youth, **Xiàn Zhī** (羡之) once encountered his spirit in person.»\n\n「He claimed, \"I am your ancestor.\" He warned him of good fortune and misfortune.\nLater, events unfolded exactly as he had spoken.\n\nCài Mó, styled **Dàomíng** (道明),\nwas from **Kǎochéng** (考城) in **Chénliú** (陈留).\nHe was the son of **Kè** (克).\nHe rose to the rank of **Governor of Yángzhōu** (杨州).\nHe was also appointed **Sìtú** (司徒), but declined.\nIn the twelfth year of **Yǒnghé** (永和), he died of illness at age seventy-six.\nHe was posthumously honored as **Sìkōng** (司空) and **Wénmù Gōng** (文穆公).\n\nThe reason this [unidentified person] was not captured by the rebellious general\nwas also due to ghosts—\nghosts cannot control one another.\nIt was because he was human.\nNo one is naturally subject to supernatural domination.\nEven the **xiānzhēn** (仙真, transcendent beings) still wield the reins and bells\nto discipline these [mortals].\nHow much more so for those of lesser rank?\n\nThe **Sì Zhèn** (四镇, Four Vanguards) each command a ghostly army of ten thousand.\nThe **Sì Guān** (四官, Four Officials) lead troops numbering no more than a few thousand.\nAmong the **Sì Zhèn**, there are:\n**Tàishān Jūn** (泰山君, Lord of Mount Tai),\n**Lúlóng Gōng** (卢龙公, Marquis of Lulong),\nand the **Dōngyuè Dà Jiāngjūn** (东越大将军, Grand General of Dongyue),\nthe **Nánbā Hóu** (南巴侯, Marquis of Nanba).\nEach of the **Sì Guān** leads ten thousand men.\n\n(The **Sì Zhèn** are not the Four Quarters [of the cosmos],\nbut rather the four cardinal directions within China.\nTheir return journeys span no more than a few thousand *lǐ* (里).\nElsewhere, there should be even greater numbers—\nthat is why, later, I spoke of hundreds of such places.)」\n\nThe **Nánbā Hóu** (南巴侯, Marquis of Nanba) was **Hé Céng** (何曾), whose style name was *Yǐngkǎo* (颖考). A native of **Yángxià** (阳夏) in **Chénjùn** (陈郡), he was the son of **Hé Zǐ** (何子). By nature, he was extravagant yet well-versed in learning, and practiced filial piety and fraternal respect. Initially serving under the **Wèi** (魏), he later rose to the positions of **Shàngshū** (尚书), **Zhēngběi Jiāngjūn** (征北将军), and **Sì Tú** (司徒). He was ennobled as **Lánglíng Hóu** (朗陵侯). In the **Jìn** (晋) dynasty, he held the titles of **Tàishǐ** (太尉), **Tàibǎo** (太保), and **Tàizǎi** (太宰) as **Lánglíng Gōng** (朗陵公). He died in the **Tàishǐ Sìnián** (太始四年) era, at over eighty years of age, and was posthumously honored with the title **Yuángōng** (元公).\n\n**Cáo Rén** (曹仁), whose style name was *Zǐxiào* (子孝), was **Wèi Wǔ** (魏武) Emperor **Cáo Cāo**’s (曹操) younger brother. Renowned for his valor and archery, he often accompanied campaigns with distinction. His rank eventually reached **Chēqí Jiāngjūn** (车骑将军) and **Dūdū Yángyǐng Yìzhōu Zhūjūn Shì Dà Jiāngjūn** (都督荆扬益州诸军事大将军). He was ennobled as **Chén Hóu** (陈侯). He died of illness in the **Huángchū Sìnián** (黄初四年) era, at fifty-six years of age, and was posthumously honored as **Zhōnghóu** (忠侯).\n\nAs for **Liú Táo** (刘陶) serving as **Dōngyuè Dà Jiāngjūn** (东越大将军), there were three such figures across the **Hàn** (汉), **Wèi** (魏), and **Jìn** (晋) dynasties. The **Hòuhàn** (后汉) one bore the style name *Zǐqí* (子奇) and was from **Yǐngchuān** (颖川). He served as **Língdì** (灵帝) Emperor’s **Shìzhōng** (侍中) and **Shàngshū Lìng** (尚书令). Later, he was imprisoned and died in confinement. The **Wèi** (魏) one bore the style name *Jìyǎo* (季冶) and was from **Huáinán** (淮南), the son of **Liú Yè** (刘晔). Though skilled in debate, he lacked moral conduct. **Cáo Shǎo** (曹爽) appointed him as **Xuǎnbù Láng** (选部郎), but he was later executed as **Píngyuán Tàishǒu** (平源太守) by **Jìngwáng** (景王). The **Jìn** (晋) one bore the style name *Zhèngyú* (正舆) and was from **Pìguó** (沛国). During the **Yǒngjiā** (永嘉) era, he served as **Yángzhōu Shìshǐ** (杨州刺史). It remains unclear which of these three was the **Dōngyuè Dà Jiāngjūn**, but by inference, it was most likely **Zhèngyú** (正舆).\n\nXún **Zǐqí** (荀｛岂页｝) served as **Tàishān Jūn** (太山君).\n\n(Xún **Zǐqí**, style name *Jǐngqiàn* (景倩), was the fourth son of **Xún Yú** (荀丕). He was well-versed in learning and possessed eloquence and logical reasoning. He assisted the **Jìn** (晋) dynasty’s establishment. Beginning from a lowly position, he became a **Huángmén Láng** (黄门郎), then successively held the offices of **Shàngshū Púshè** (尚书仆射), **Sìkōng** (司空), **Tàiyè** (太尉), and **Tàifù** (太傅). He passed away in the tenth year of the **Tàishǐ** (太始) era, at the age of seventy, and was posthumously honored as **Kāng Gōng** (康公). According to **Sū Yáo** (苏韶)'s *Transmission* (传云), **Liú Kǒngcái** (刘孔才) served as **Tàishān Gōng** (太山公) and plotted to rebel against the **Northern Dì** (北帝). He was later executed and eradicated. **Kǒngcái** (孔才) was none other than **Liú Shào** (刘邵).\n\nAdditionally, **Méi Yí** (梅颐) held the post of **Yùzhāng Tàishǒu** (豫章太守). In a dream, he was summoned to serve as **Tàishān Fǔjūn** (太山府君). Upon waking, he died shortly thereafter. It remains unclear whether these two positions were distinct from that of **Tàishān Jūn** (太山君).\n\nIt is also said that there existed a **Tàishān Lìng** (太山令), commanding a force of ten thousand soldiers to garrison a location—such garrisons numbered several hundred in total. Some commanded garrisons of several thousand soldiers, all subordinate to one another. Each had a **Chángshǐ** (长史) and **Sīmǎ** (司马).\n\n**Wáng Wéndù** (王文度) was stationed in **Guǎnglíng** (广陵). Suddenly, he saw a soldier appear and summon him, saying, *\"You are to be appointed as **Píngběi Jiāngjūn** (平北将军) and **Sìshǐ** (刺史) of **Xú** (徐) and **Dài** (兖) states.\"* **Wáng** (王) replied, *\"I have already been appointed to this office.\"* The soldier said, *\"This is a celestial appointment.\"* In a short while, the soldier vanished, and soon afterward, **Wáng** was led away and died.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** (天地间事理) of existence transcends human understanding and cannot be fathomed by mere conjecture. Even in the unseen and visible realms, there are three categories: **xiān** (仙, the celestial), **rén** (人, the human), and **guǐ** (鬼, the spectral). Those who cultivate virtue may ascend to become **xiān** (celestial beings). Those who are exiled from the celestial realm may reincarnate as humans. The wicked among humans may descend to become **guǐ** (spectral beings). The fortunate among **guǐ** may return to human form. **Guǐ** (spectral beings) emulate humans, while humans emulate **xiān** (celestial beings). This cyclical transformation follows patterns, with each category mirroring the others in kind. It is merely a subtle distinction between the hidden and the manifest.\n\nThe enlightened observe this **Dao/Way** (达者监之) and thus find no further cause for concern.\n\nXún took **Gù Zhòng** (顾众, *Gù Zhòng*, lit. \"Gù the Crowd\") as his **Tàishān** (太山, *Tàishān*) **jiāngjūn** (将军, *General*). He appointed **Cáo Hóng** (曹洪, *Cáo Hóng*) as his **sīmǎ** (司马, *Military Secretary*). **Huán Fàn** (桓范, *Huán Fàn*) served as his **chángshǐ** (长史, *Chief Clerk*).\n\n**Gù Zhòng** (顾众, *Gù Zhòng*, *Gù Zhòng*), courtesy name **Chángshǐ** (长始, *Long Begin*), was from **Wújìng** (吴郡, *Wu Commandery*). He was **Gù Xīn** (顾心, *Gù Xīn*)’s son, and **Gù Bì** (顾秘, *Gù Bì*)’s grandson. He held offices under the **Jìn** (晋, *Jin Dynasty*) as **Dānyáng** (丹阳, *Dan Yang Prefect*), **Lǐngjūn** (领军, *Commander-in-Chief of the Army*), **Shàngshū** (尚书, *Secretary*), and **Púshè** (仆射, *Attendant-in-Chief*). He died in the second year of **Yǒnghé** (永和, *Eternal Harmony*), at the age of seventy-three. He was posthumously honored as **Tèjìn** (特进, *Extraordinary Progress*), and his posthumous title was **Jìng Bó** (靖伯, *Pacifying Marquis*).\n\n**Cáo Hóng** (曹洪, *Cáo Hóng*), courtesy name **Zǐ Lián** (子廉, *Child of Integrity*), was a younger cousin of **Wèiwǔ** (魏武, *Wei the Martial*). Though his family was wealthy, he was stingy and frugal. He participated in many military campaigns and was appointed **Piāoqí** (骠骑, *Light Cavalry General*), granted the title **Lèchéng Hóu** (乐成侯, *Marquis of Joyous Achievement*). He died of illness in the sixth year of **Tàihé** (太和, *Great Harmony*).\n\n**Huán Fàn** (桓范, *Huán Fàn*), courtesy name **Fú Zé** (符则, *Symbol of Justice*), was from **Píguó** (沛国, *Pei Commandery*). He was skilled in strategy and administration. He served under the **Wèi** (魏, *Wei Dynasty*) and rose to the position of **Tàisīnóng** (太司农, *Grand Minister of Agriculture*). He was implicated in the **Cáo Shuǎng** (曹爽, *Cao Shuang*) case and executed.\n\nWhen **Wáng Yìshǎo** (王逸少, *Wang the Leisurely*) had some matter to attend to, he was imprisoned in the **jìnzhōng** (禁中, *Forbidden City*) for five years. He said, \"The matter has already been resolved.\" (This is **Wáng Yòujūn** (王右军, *Wang of the Right Army*), who, at the time, did not wish to call **Yáng Jūn** (杨君, *Lord Yang*) by his name, hence he referred to him by his courtesy name. **Yìshǎo** (逸少) was **Wáng Kuàng** (王旷, *Wang the Broad*)’s son, who was **Wáng Yòujūn**’s younger brother. He had a refined manner and was skilled in calligraphy. Later, he served as **Kuàijì** (会稽, *Huai Commandery*) **Tàiguān** (太守, *Prefect*).)\n\nThe Prefect of Kuàijì departed in the eleventh year of **Yǒnghé** (永和). He declared, *\"My spirit shall not return to office.\"* Earlier, he had frequented **Xǔ Xiānshēng** (許先生, *Master Xu*), and though he had some admiration for the Dao, by the fifth year of **Shēngpíng** (升平), in the year **Xīnyǒu** (辛酉), he died at the age of fifty-nine.\n\nIn the year **Yǐchǒu** (乙丑), it was said that five years had passed since his death. Yet, he was still imprisoned—though no record of his offense could be found. It was feared that his imprisonment was due to lingering resentment in his heart, and that his spirit had been exiled.\n\n**Jiǎng Jì** (蒋济), ennobled as **Nánshānbó** (南山伯, *Marquis of Nan Mountain*), led two thousand troops. **Jiǎng Jì**, courtesy name **Zǐtōng** (子通), was from Píng'é (平阿) in **Chǔ** (楚). Serving under the **Hàn** and **Wèi**, he rose to the position of **Tàiyè** (太尉, *Grand Tutor*). He followed **Xuānwáng** (宣王, *Prince Xuan*) in executing **Cáo Shuǎng** (曹爽), and died that same year, posthumously honored as **Jǐnghóu** (景侯, *Marquis Jing*).\n\nWhen he served as **Lǐngjūn** (领军, *Commander-in-Chief of the Army*), his wife dreamed that their deceased son appeared as **Tàishān Wǔbó** (太山五伯, *the Fifth Marquis of Tai Mountain*), coming to welcome the western grandson at the ancestral temple. The grandson was then the **Lǐng** (令, *Magistrate) of Tàishān**, and the dreamer begged him to intercede for a favorable transfer. **Jiǎng Jì** granted his request, and the grandson soon died as well. Later, another dream revealed that the transfer had already been recorded.\n\nSuch cases demonstrate that, though ghostly offices and ranks may roughly correspond to one’s earthly status, they are often wildly inconsistent. This disparity arises from the varying degrees of **virtue/power** (德) and **achievements** (业), as well as the weight of one’s merits and faults. Thus, their posthumous rankings are reassigned, no longer strictly adhering to their original foundations.\n\nThe King **Guǎng Yì** (广异) served as a **Ghostly General of a Department** (部鬼将军). **Guǎng Yì**, with the courtesy name **Shìjiāng** (世将), was from **Lángyǔ** (琅玉), the son of **Móuchéng** (修龄), and the father of the dreamer. He excelled in talent, arts, governance, and literature, skilled in composition and music. He rose to the rank of **General of Píngnán** (平南将军) and **Inspector of Jīngzhōu** (荆州刺史). At the age of forty-seven, he fell ill and died. He was posthumously honored as **Kāng Hóu** (康侯) and granted the title of **Chuàoqí** (骠骑).\n\nSuch cases reveal those with **posthumous recognition** (有识位者). They are roughly identifiable, but those without rank are countless and beyond full comprehension.\n\nThese are all matters discussed in later sections. For instance, **Xún Zhōnghóu** (荀中侯) was mentioned without a surname, yet later it was clarified—perhaps to distinguish him from others. The individuals discussed are mostly from recent times, likely due to the **transformation and variation** (代谢参差) of their **karmic records** (亿识), as well as the ease of recognizing those from the **Three Dynasties** (三代). Yet, the **Two Hán**, **Wéi**, and **Jìn** dynasties indeed had many talented and renowned figures, such as **Liú Xiàng** (刘向), **Dòng Zhòngshū** (董仲舒), **Yáng Xióng** (扬雄), **Zhāng Héng** (张衡), **Cài Xuān** (蔡川), **Zhèng Xuán** (郑玄), **Wáng Bì** (王弼), and **Ruǎn Qǐshān** (阮稽山) and their peers. They should not be **scattered without rank** (空散), nor should their **karmic calculations** (数术) be like those of **Guǎn Gōu** (管郭), who lack clear traces. Thus, they likely do not belong to the **Three Officials** (三官) but may instead be **assigned to Daoist/Immortal duties** (仙家驱任).\n\nIn the earlier discussion of **emperors and kings** (帝王), their posthumous status was also uneven. **Wéi Wén** (魏文) and **Jìn Wǔ** (晋武), though **Mandated Sovereigns** (受命之主), did not attain prominence. Conversely, **Wéi Wǔ** (魏武) and **Jìn Xuān** (晋宣) were celebrated, while **Sūn Quán** (孙权) should be ranked alongside **Liú Bèi** (刘备), yet neither was recorded in the **Celestial Strategies** (道策). These discrepancies arise from the **foundations of their earthly kingdoms** (启国之基) and the **joyous acknowledgment of their great achievements** (功高乐推). As for those who merely **inherited the throne and upheld the traditions** (继体守文之君), none were recognized.\n\nThe following two sections were recorded as per the **emperor’s decree** (受旨), all by **Yáng Jūn** (杨君). The texts were meticulously compiled, and later officials further transcribed them. Both versions are identical, each forming a separate volume, detailing the beginning and end of these matters.\n\n**Xǔ Zhào** (许肇), now the **Right Commander of Dōngmíng Gōng** (东明公右帅), holds a position akin to the **Chief Secretary** (世间中书监) of the mortal realm. Though **Xǔ Zhào** (许肇), with the courtesy name **Zǐ’ē** (子阿), is the seventh-generation ancestor of **Chángshǐ** (长史) and **Sìtú Jìng** (司徒敬), his **meritorious deeds** (赈救之功) were not of the **hidden virtue** (阴德) kind.\n\n「Hence, he had not yet received the **transformation of the Dao** (受化). Yet his blessings spread to later generations (福流后叶). Only then did the **Celestial Court** (上) elevate him, making him a **Nine Palaces Immortal** (九宫之仙) thereafter. Such was the office of **Right Commander** (帅晨), and **Sìmíng** (四明) also held this title.\n\n**Shào** (邵) served as **Dōngmíng Gōng** (东明公). **Yún Xíng** (云行) then became **Right Protector of the Nine Palaces** (九宫右保公) as a **Celestial Supplement** (上补). (Earlier, **Shào** was recorded as **Nánmíng Gōng** (南明公); now it is **Dōng** (东). If this is not an error in the title, then the difference between **Dōng** (东) and **Nán** (南) must be due to his **ascension and promotion** (迁擢). Thus, he must be the **Central Lord of the Nine Palaces** (启中君) who later took the name **Yún Shào** (云邵). He also possessed the **virtue of the Sweet Osmanthus** (甘棠之德), so his **lifespan and celestial tenure** (年月) were not restricted.\n\nOn the night of the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the **Celestial Records** (定录) were finalized as per the **Central Lord’s testimony** (君所告). These two entries were separately recorded (别受), unrelated to the **Ministry of Archives** (记部). **Xīn Yuànzǐ** (辛玄子), in his own account and verse (自叙并诗), states: (The following line is partially missing; the exact characters remain unknown.) Yuànzǐ, courtesy name **Yán Qī** (延期), was from **Dìnggǔ, Língxī** (陇西定谷人), a native of **Lǒuyáng** (上洛) in **Yúnzhōng** (云中) during the reign of **Emperor Míng of Hàn** (汉明帝). He was the son of **Sīn Yǐn** (辛隐), the **Prefect of Three Commanderies** (三郡太守) of **Zhào** (赵国) in **Lǒuyáng** (上洛).\n\n(Sīn Yǐn’s courtesy name is unclear; the **external records** (外书) do not provide this information. According to the **ancestral lineage of the Sīn clan** (诸辛旧开陇豪族), the **Former Hàn** (前汉) had **Sīn Qìngjì** (辛庆忌), and the **Later Hàn** (后汉) had **Sīn Lián** (辛缮), both men of **lofty integrity and uprightness** (高直之士). **Sīn Yǐn** (辛隐) was the **eighth-generation ancestor** (八世祖) of **Sīn Yuànzǐ** (辛玄子), with **Sīn Yǐn** (辛隐) being the **seventh-generation descendant** (七世孙) of **Sīn Tiánbǐ** (辛田比). This spans merely **one hundred and forty to fifty years** (一百四五十年中), making the eight generations seem too compressed.)\n\nFrom his youth, **Yuànzǐ** (玄子) was devoted to the **Dao** (道), diligently observing **precepts and vows** (法戒) and practicing **sincere and arduous cultivation** (至心苦行).\n\nFrom midday on, he subsisted on simple vegetables, refining his form and preserving his essence, untouched by external influences. Though the prefectures and governorships sought to recruit him, he never lowered himself to accept. He wandered the mountains and forests, abandoning worldly affairs and dust, his aspirations aligned with those of **Yú Jìn** (子晋) under **Sīhóu** (丝侯) and **Zēn** (岑), and his companionship with **Língyáng** (陵阳) in **Bù Xuán** (步玄). Thus, he changed his name to **Yuànzǐ** (玄子) and took **Yánqī** (延期) as his courtesy name.\n\nHe did not foresee that his ancestors had committed many transgressions, bringing calamity upon their descendants. He was ensnared by imperial edicts, his fate sealed by later generations, and his life did not last long—he perished at the **Chángliáng Ferry** (长梁之津). The **Western Queen Mother** (西王母) observed his arduous cultivation; the **Heavenly Sovereign of the Northern Dipper** (都北帝) pitied his **Dao-heart** (道心) and instructed the **Office of Fate** (司命) to send decrees to the **Three Officials** (三官), commanding them to seize his corporeal form, return his soul to its true nature, and grant him rebirth. Thus, he was endowed with **spiritual essence** (胎神), attaining the rank of **Língshén** (灵神). Over two hundred years have passed since then.\n\n(His death by drowning mirrors that of **Wang Yǎn’s daughter** (王衍之女), and it is feared that this corporeal form may never again be reborn, as it is but a **retrograde essence** (反质) and **spiritual embryo** (胎神). Though he possessed a Dao-heart, he lacked Dao-achievement, so he could not immediately ascend to the ranks of the immortals.)\n\nRecently, he received the **initiation name** (度名) **Nángōng** (南宫) and the **destined strategy** (定策) **Zhūlíng** (朱陵). Now he conceals his essence, awaiting the proper time, before officially ranking among the immortals. Meanwhile, the **Great Emperor** (大帝) has already seen fit to appoint him as the **Marquis of the Eastern Sea** (东海侯), replacing **Guǎngyú** (广臾). He is also now charged with the role of **Central Officer of the Imperial Guards** (禁元中郎将), overseeing the **ghosts and spirits of Wúyuè** (吴越). His duties in the **royal affairs** (王事) are endless—this is indeed laborious.\n\nThe **Morning Crown and Azure Sash**—\nthe rustling sleeves of feathered grace,\nthe chime of bells upon celestial steps,\nthe turning of jade halls—\n\nThough the heart remains pure yet the sun sets,\nI lament not yet ascending to join the **Mysterious True**,\nto rank alongside **Yùkūn** and **Tǔyōng** in serene repose.\nI hear the lingering strains of the **Divine Music**,\nplucking **spirit-mushrooms** from the hidden peaks,\nshaking my emerald robes in the Nine Heavens,\ndancing the **Dark Feathers** of the Ten Directions.\n\nNow I must govern the host of ghosts,\njudge right from wrong,\ndwelling amid the filth of mortals,\nmy voice mingling with the clamor of demons.\nMy deeds stray from **Dao and Virtue**,\nmy gaze falters before the True.\nYet I compare my stillness to the **Silent Void**,\nsoaring free in the **Primordial Beginning**.\n\nFor harmony unites like sounds,\nand kindred things share their nature—\nthus I am called to the **Upper Clarity**,\nmy name inscribed in the **Cinnabar Register** of the **Mysterious Seed**.\nThe **Qi of the Dao** merges with the **Virtue of the Spirit**,\nmy luminous form ascends in splendor—\nthat is why they come to follow.\n\nNow I present three poems,\nto express the depth of my esteem.\nThe verses read:\n\nIn the Nine Heavens, the **Dark Feathers** of the Ten Directions resound—\nnow I must govern the host of ghosts,\ncommand the spirits of the **Booming Register**,\nand preside over the **Silent Void**’s appointed duties.\nThus I first compose these verses to express my deepest reverence.\n\nThe **Ghost Script** differs in its mysteries,\nnot penned by my own hand—\nI must have received its words through the **Oral Transmission** of the **Cinnabar Register**.\n\nIn days past, I entered the **Land of Darkness**,\nmy carriage responding to the **Divine Summons** of the **Spirit Way**.\nThe **Ghostly Qi** dispersed with the **Void of Space**,\nand vanished like the **Celebratory Clouds**.\nMy form was not of **Luminous Jade**’s essence—\nhow could the **Dark Artisan** carve such perfection?\nYet my **feet like butterflies** drift in whispered verse,\nmy gaze uplifted to admire the **Resounding Bamboo**.\nThe **Forest Chamber** holds its own delight,\ncutting off all ties with the **Lofty Exchange** beyond.\nThe lingering **Effulgence** clings to the **Round Radiance**,\nbut the **Auspicious Sounds** are few and far between.\n\n*(This poem recounts the origins of my deeds.)*\n\nThe **Silent Void**’s **Dao** is a vessel for inspiration,\nits **Dark Art** a conduit for the **Moving Sounds** of the **Spirit Way**.\nThough the **High Wheels** may seem uneven,\nall things seek the **Ten Thousand Fathoms**’ path.\nThe **Playful Wind** attunes to the **Dao’s Child**,\nmy **Spirit** in perfect harmony with the **Divine Essence**.\nI submit to the **Waves of the World’s Transformation**,\nmy heart set upon the **Lofty and Elusive Forest**.\nWith **Kindred Souls**, I wander beyond the **External Reason**,\nand together we rest in the **Stillness of the Eastern [Garment] [Peaks]**.\n\n*(This poem explains the reasons for my esteemed arrival.)*\n\nMy **Spirit Way**’s **Virtue** extends far—\nmy **Playful Tracks** transcend the **Land of Darkness**.\nIn the **Void of Space**, there are things that exist,\nyet within them, there is no permanence.\nThe **Awakened Speech** bridges the **Boundaries of Having and Not Having**,\nand we meet again at the **Hao Bridge**.\nWith **Divine Vision**, I grasp the **Dark Art’s** revelation—\nthe **Ghosts and Spirits** forget their own **Dao’s Reason**.\n*(This poem explores the profound mysteries of human and ghostly interaction.)*\n\nThe **Dao’s Child** speaks thus:\n\n「In the time of the **Wei [state]**, there was **Sin [田比]**, courtesy name **Zu [佐]**. He was the grandson of the seventh generation. In the first year of Emperor **Jianwu [建武]** of the Han, he followed the relocation from **Longxi [陇西]** to settle in **Yingchuan [颖川]**, **Yang [阳]** County. **Sin [田比]** served under the **Wei [state]** and was appointed as the **Commander-in-Chief of the Great General [司马宣王]’s army**, **Superintendent of the Armory [衛尉]**, and granted the title of **Hou [封侯]**. His son was named **Chang [敞]**, who became the **Governor of Hebei [河內太守]** and **Minister of the Imperial Sacrifices [太常卿]**. (*All as said aligns with the records in the **Wei Book [魏書]**.*)\n\nThe **Dao’s Child [玄子]** says: **Guang [廣臾]** was born as the **Grand General of the Jin [晉]**. The **Northern Emperor [北帝]** once appointed him as the **Commander of the Pacification of the East [抚东将军]**. Later, he was transferred to become the **Eastern Sea Hou [东海侯]**. Now, he is again appointed as the **Left Attendant of the Emperor’s Morning Court [台侍帝晨右禁监]**—a position of great weight. Recently, **Feng [馮] Huai [怀]** was taken as **Commander of the Armory [司馬]**. The **Emperor’s Morning Court Attendant [侍帝晨]** is now like the **Chief of the Right Division [世右衛將軍]**, but with even greater importance. (*This differs greatly from previous accounts. It seems he was later promoted to **Chief Attendant [侍中]** while also leading the **Right Division [衛]**. This would make him the **Commander of the Right Division [衛]**, as there was no **Commander of the Armory [司馬]** at that time. **Feng [馮] Huai [怀]**’s courtesy name was **Zu [祖]**, and he was from **Changle [長樂]**. During the reign of Emperor **Cheng [成]** of the Jin, he served as **Scattered Cavalry of the Imperial Sacrifices [太常散騎]** and **Constant Companion [常侍]**. Upon his death, he was posthumously honored with the **Golden and Purple Light of the Imperial Sacrifices [金紫光禄階]**.*)\n\nThe **Left Attendant of the Emperor’s Morning Court [左禁监]** was **Xie [謝] Youyu [幼舆]**. He appointed **Deng [登] Yi [邑] Yu [岳]** as **Commander of the Armory [司馬]**. (*This is equivalent to the **Left Division General [左衛將軍]**. **Youyu [幼舆]** was named **Kun [鲲]**, the father of **Xie An [謝安]**’s elder brother **Xie Shang [謝尚]**. He served as **Chief of Staff for Wang Dun [王敦長史]** and **Governor of Yuzhang [豫章郡太守]**. At the age of fifty-three, he fell ill and died. He was posthumously honored as **Minister of the Imperial Sacrifices [太常]**, and his posthumous title was **Kang Hou [康侯]**. **Deng [登] Yi [邑] Yu [岳]** has already been mentioned earlier, but here it states that he was the one who replaced **Zhou [周] Gai [岂]** as **Commander of the Armory and Chief of the Guards [司馬帥]**.*)\n\n**Xi [希] Yi [邑]**, **Nanchang Gong [南昌公]**, first served as **Southern Zhuyang [南朱陽]** **Great Gate [大門]** **Spirit Pass Guardian [靈關侯]** for the **Northern Emperor [北帝]**. Later, he was transferred to become **High Official of Gaoming [高明司直]**. Once, he was seated and involved in a dispute with **Liu Qing Sun [劉慶孫]** over an official pardon.»\n\nNow he was about to resume his office once more. The **High Official of Gaoming [高明司直]** was akin to the **Worldly Grand Secretary [世尚书]** or **Grand Chamberlain [仆射]**.\n\n(Previously, it was stated that **Xi [希邑]** served as **Southern Gate Warden [南门亭长]**. The **Southern Gate Warden** was likely the same as the **Spirit Pass Guardian [灵关侯]** position. After **Zhou [周] Gai [岂]** took over his duties, he was then transferred to the **High Official of Gaoming [司直]**. The words of **Guo Changxiang [郭长翔]** also confirm this: *\"**Xi [希邑]** was greatly humbled when appointed as **Southern Gate Warden [天门亭长]**. In olden times, the selection often used **State Officers of Two Thousand Bushels [州征二千石]**—there were none who were **Three Dukes [三公]** in rank. This is why he was quickly promoted.\"*)\n\n**He Qidao [何次道]**, currently residing within the **Nanchang Palace [南宫]** at the **Cheng Hua Terrace [承华台]**, has already received the **Scripture [书]**. Upon reaching the **Southern Peak [南岳]**, this person was still alive. His deeds of benevolence were numerous, so he was able to regain his form early. (Previously, **Xun Gong [荀公]** spoke of **He [何]** first obtaining the **return of his red vitality [还朱火]**. Now it is said that he had already received the **Scripture**, meaning **He Xiangzi [玄子]**’s restoration came later.)\n\nZhou Bó-rén has recently been appointed as the **Central Protector of Ximing Gong [西明公中都护]**. The **Central Protector** is an office akin to that of the **Grand Tutor of the Realm [世太傅]**. However, **Yōu Bùpíng [攸不平]** was seated in selection—his promotion was unjust. He was demoted to **Central Guardian [中护]**, equivalent to the rank of **Minor Tutor [少傅]**.\n\n(Zhou originally held the post of **Marshal of Destiny [司命帅]**. He should have been succeeded by **Chéng Xí [程遐]** before being transferred to this office. **Yōu Bùpíng**, styled **Bódào [伯道]**, was from **Xiangling, Pingyang [平阳襄陵]**. He served under the Jin as **Master of the Imperial Heir’s Attendants [太子洗马]**, **Minister of Personnel [吏部郎]**, and **Governor of Hedong [河东太守]**. He was captured by **Shí Lè [石勒]** but later returned to the east, becoming **Governor of Wujun [吴郡太守]** and **Minister of Personnel [吏部尚书]**. He died of illness in the first year of **Xiánhé [咸和]**, aged forty-seven, and was posthumously honored as **Lord of Light [光禄]**. When **Yōu Bùpíng** returned from rebellion with the Hu, he abandoned his own son and brought only his younger brother’s child across the river. Thus, he had no descendants, leaving no heirs. **Xiè Àn [谢安]** sighed, *\"Heaven’s ways are inscrutable—why did **Yōu Bódào [攸伯道]** have no son?\"*\n\nThe above is what **Xīn Xuánzǐ [辛玄子]** spoke of—his accounts of the **Netherworld [冥中]** are numerous. Here, I have only roughly recorded the **fragmentary [鹿鹿鹿]** portions, without elaborating further. (Though this record is from **Xuánzǐ’s** teachings, it also includes words from **Yang Jun [杨君]**. Yang’s original text is lost, and only a copyist’s draft remains. The manuscript was later partially cut away, so the accounts may not be entirely complete.)\n\nThose of **utter loyalty and filial piety**, upon death, receive the **Scripture [书]** to become **Netherworld Rulers [地下主]**. After **one hundred and forty years**, they are granted instruction in **Lower Dao [下仙之教]** and taught the **Great Way [大道]**. From then on, they gradually ascend, eventually **supplementing the ranks of the Immortals [补仙官]**. After another **one hundred and forty years**, they are permitted a **trial advancement [试进]**. (These **Netherworld Rulers** are the same as those recorded in the **Cavern Texts [洞中所记]**—such as **Lǐ [李] (East)**—not separate ghostly officials appointed anew. Each **one hundred and forty years** marks a promotion to the next rank, where they serve as **Immortal Envoys [仙人使]**, only then beginning to receive Daoist teachings.)\n\nThe **filially pious** can move **ghosts and spirits**, causing **birds and beasts of the mountains** to guard their tombs **[巡其坟土延]**. The **utterly loyal** act with **unwavering rectitude**, their **essence piercing the sun [精贯白日]**, or even **severing their own bodies** to inspire their rulers. **Bǐ Gān [比干]** now resides at **Róngshān [戎山]**, while **Lǐ Shàn [李善]** is at **Shàoshì [少室]**. Many have undergone such **transmutations [变鍊]**, but these two serve as examples. (Bǐ Gān’s **severed heart** exemplifies **utter loyalty**, while accounts of filial sons moving spirits are also numerous. Yet here, only **Lǐ Shàn** is mentioned—his case seems misplaced, as his deeds align more with **loyalty than filial piety**. Perhaps it is because he preserved **Lǐ Yuán’s [李元] lineage**, ensuring succession, thus fulfilling filial duty. The merits of such acts need not be debated further. Figures like **Chéng Yīng [程婴]** and **Qí Sūn Qiújiù [齐孙杵臼]** should also be counted among the **filially pious**.)\n\n**Lǐ Shàn**, styled **Cìxùn [次逊]**, was originally a slave of **Lǐ Yuán [李元]** from **Yùyáng, Nanyang [南阳育阳]**. During the **Han Jiànwǔ [建武]** era, when **Lǐ Yuán’s** household perished and amassed great wealth, only one orphan, **Xùzǔ [续祖]**, remained—a baby in arms. The slaves conspired to divide the estate among themselves, but **Shàn** secretly carried **Xùzǔ** away, fleeing to **Xiáqiūshān [瑕丘山]**, where he nursed and raised him. When **Xùzǔ** was over ten years old, **Shàn** revealed him to **County Magistrate Zhōnglíyì [锺离意]**, who then recommended him, taking all the slaves under his care and establishing **Xùzǔ** as the heir. The **Emperor Guangwǔ [光武]** appointed **Shàn** as **Attendant of the Imperial Heir [太子舍人]**, later promoting him to **Governor of Jīnnán and Jiāngxi [日南九江太守]**. His deeds were as described, though **Zhōnglí’s** account differs slightly in places.)\n\nThose who possess **supreme sagely virtue [上圣之德]**, upon death...\n\n「All receive the **Three Officials’** scrolls as rulers of the underworld.\nAfter a thousand years,\nthey are then assigned to supplement the **Five Emperors** of the **Three Officials**.\nSome become the **Lords of the East, West, South, and North**,\nto govern the spirits and deities.\nAfter another thousand four hundred years,\nthey may attain the **Great Clarity** and roam freely,\nbecoming the **Middle Immortal** of the **Nine Palaces**.\n\n*(In terms of years, even this **sagely virtue** falls short of loyalty and filial piety.\nCalculating from death, a total of two thousand four hundred years\nbefore one may enter the ranks of the **Immortal Stage**.\nThis makes it clear that the earlier passage must refer to **Xià Qǐ [夏启]**, not **Míng Gōng [召公明]**.\nAfter **Jìzǐ’s** death, until the **Jìn** era of **Xīngníng [兴宁]**, it was only about eight hundred and eighty years—\nfar short of a thousand.\nI wonder if he had already become a **Lord**?\n*[The records from the capital mention none of the **Five Emperors** in this context.\nPerhaps this follows the precedent of the **Northern Emperor**, who also has five.\nThus, later mentions of **Heroes** as the **Five Emperors’** supreme ministers,\nwhile the **Northern Emperor** has **Qín Huáng [秦皇]**.\nThe **Sū Zhāo** transmission also states that **Yáng Xióng [扬雄]**, **Zhāng Hēng [张衡]**, and others are among the **Five Emperors**—\nbut **Yáng Xióng** and **Zhāng Hēng** are not **supreme sages**;\ntheir ranks are humble,\nand they should not be equated with **Yán Dì [炎帝]**.\nThere may also be lesser **Five Emperors** not listed here.\nThe accounts of **Yáng Xióng** and **Zhāng Hēng** may not be accurate either.)*\n\nThose who possess **boundless magnanimity** and **unrivaled prospects**,\nnurturing their **浩然** *Great Qi*,\nyet do not seek honor and wealth,\nupon death\nreceive the **Three Officials’** scrolls as the **spirit of benevolent clarity**.\nAfter four hundred years,\nthey may attain the rank of **ruler of the underworld**.\nFrom there, they advance in stages,\nwith three hundred years marking each **ascension to Immortal Officials**.\n\n*(This refers to the rank of **recluse-sage** and **eremitic virtuous ones**.\nFrom the **ruler of the underworld** onward,\nthis is entering the **Immortal Stage**,\nno longer serving as a **spirit-official**.)*\n\nThose with **uttermost integrity and utmost frugality**,\nupon death\nreceive the scrolls as **pure spirits** of the **Three Officials**.\nAfter two hundred and eighty years,\nthey may attain the rank of **ruler of the underworld**.\nFrom there, they gradually ascend\nto become **Immortal Officials**,\nwith two hundred and eighty years as one stage.\n\n*(This rank is slightly inferior to that of the **recluse-sage**,\nyet the years required are double those for loyalty and filial piety—\nthus, it is clear that **loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and frugality** are the most esteemed virtues in practice.)*\n\nAs for the **utterly frugal**,\nthey do not eat food not earned by themselves,\nnor wear silk or cloth not acquired by their own labor—\n**Wáng Yáng [王阳]** was such a man.\n*(This category should be measured against **Yí Qí [夷齐]** as the standard.\nThere are many examples among **recluse-sages**,\nyet today only **Wáng Yáng** is cited—\nhis natural purity was innate,\nnot a deliberate act of pristine virtue.\n**Wáng Yáng** was a person of the **Former Han** era.)*\n\nAs for the **utterly chaste**,\nluxury and splendor cannot sway their uprightness,\nnor can the might of a great kingdom shake their reputation and conduct.\nFor men, **Gù Guāng [务光]**’s deeds are similar.\nFor women, **Sòng Jīn Piāo’s** daughter is the example.\n*(The **chaste** are not merely those who avoid licentiousness in deed—\nthey also resist the **inflamed heart** of coveting honor and profit.\n**Gù Guāng** declined the **Tāng** dynasty’s offer of office,\nyet he carried stones and cast himself into the river.)*\n\nSòng Jīn Piāo’s daughter—likely the one **Zǐxú [子胥]** encountered\nwhile washing silk by the **Fèi Shā [浣沙]** ford on the banks of the **Piāo Shǔi [漂水]**.\nLater, when she returned his gift of gold,\nshe was thus called **Jīn Piāo [金漂]**.\n(The character *piāo* may also be written as *liáo* [漂], meaning \"water chestnut.\")\n\nHer ancestors had meritorious deeds before the **Three Officials [Sān Guān]**.\nThough their virtue extended through generations,\nsome descendants were reborn in altered forms—\nchanged surnames, new lives—\nthis was the **seven-generational hidden virtue**,\nits roots and branches intertwined.\n\nWhen death came,\nshe left behind **one bone** to return to the **Three Officials**,\nwhile the rest followed her body’s journey.\nMen’s remains were buried on the **left**,\nwomen’s on the **right**—\neach received a **scroll** to serve as **underground sovereigns**.\nAfter **280 years**,\nthey could ascend to the **Dao of Earthly Immortals**.\n\nAt the moment of death,\nher flesh remained supple as the living,\nand when she shed mortality,\nher corpse did not stiffen—\nher fingers stayed unblue,\nher limbs unwrinkled—\nthis was **preordained virtue**,\na natural **emaciation-death [shíjiě]**.\n\n(This was from **ancestral hidden deeds and profound virtue**,\nnot constrained by outward actions—\nnot something she herself could **argue or force**.)\n\nThus, she left **one bone** to repay the **Three Officials**—\nthis bone was likely the **corporeal bone**,\nnot the **spiritual bone**.\nOnce abandoned, it would again be reborn—\nthe *Great Capital* [Dàdū] discusses among the **Daoists and Ghosts** [xiān guǐ] those who in life practiced **self-mutilation** (kūfù) or **self-beheading** (fùjǐng),\nwhose bodies were split and shattered by death—\nthese were forever severed from their later forms.\nTheir **spirit** had already departed beforehand,\nso now their **flesh** could be killed, maimed, or mutilated—\ninitially, their **spirit** was not cut off.\nYet some in the world see **ghostly bodies** not fully intact—\nthese are merely **corporeal shells** [shǐpò] sheltering **spirits**,\nnot the **Great Spirit** [Dàshén] that governs their **true essence** [běnjīng].\nThe theory of **emaciation-death** [shíjiě] has many variations,\nalready recorded in the **Third Volume**.\n\nAll five of these cases\nwere those who cultivated **virtue/power** [dé] and attained **Daoist Immortality** [xiān],\nwithout study or effort—\nonly the difficulty of their **ranked stages** [jiējí] required time.\nOnce they attained the **name of self-liberation** [zìdù], they no longer followed the **Three Officials'** commands**.\n\n(Though these five cases encompass seven distinct **matters** [shì],\neach varying in **lightness and weight** [qīngzhòng],\nonly those of **unwavering resolve** [zhì] could achieve such examples.\nNow, even in the **grades of Daoist learning** [xué dào zhī pǐn],\nmere trifling **minor practices** [wēiwēi xiǎoyè] suffice to match them—\nhow much more so for true **mysteries** [zhēnmiào]?\nFrom this perspective,\none should not underestimate oneself!)\n\nAmong those with **heroic talents** [yīngxióng zhī cái],\nwho pacified the **four seas** [sìhǎi],\nslayed tyrants and ended chaos,\nexpanded the **Nine Regions** [jiǔzhōu],\nand established the **title of Emperor** [dìwáng],\nruling over the **four quarters** [sìhài] as **subjects and servants** [chénqiè]—\nafter death,\nthey received **scrolls** from the **Three Officials** and **Four Assistants** [sìfǔ],\nsome becoming **Prime Ministers of the Five Emperors** [Wǔdì shàngxiàng],\nothers **Guests of the Four Ming Lords** [Sìmíng gōng bīnyǒu],\nto aid in governing **a hundred ghosts** [bǎiguǐ],\nand overseeing the **administration of life and death** [zōnglǐ sǐshēng].\nThese ranks are forever bound to the **Three Officials**,\nwith no hope of ascending to **Daoist Immortality**.\nThey are **condemned** [zuò] for their **violent deeds** [fá] and **cruelty** [jǔ],\nwhich harm the **cycles of life and death** [sǐshēng duōgù].\n\n(Their **official duties** [gōngzhōng zhū rén zhí] are all accounted for—\nI suspect **Xun** [Xún] may have **omitted** [shì] one.)\n\nThe refined and virtuous—\nnot the domineering and cruel—\nonly those who devise sagacious schemes and strategies to assist **Wei Wu** [魏武]\nare granted the rank of **Guests** and **Friends**,\nand placed alongside **Han Gao** [汉高] in station.\nPerhaps there are deeper intentions here.\n\nAll who in this world possess talent, insight, or skill\nand are acclaimed in their time,\nafter death,\nare assigned their positions according to their merit—\nno need to dwell on their petty crimes in life\nbefore they are consigned to the **examinations of the dead** [zhū rén zhū zhí].\nIf their transgressions are extreme and unjust,\nthey are beyond reckoning.\nIf they are idle and frivolous,\nthey are not distinguished from ordinary souls—\n**no matter the size of their guilt, all are settled in their fate.**\n\n**Qin Shi Huang** [秦始皇] now serves as the **Prime Minister of the Northern Emperor** [北帝上相],\nwhile **Liu Bang** [刘季] is a **Guest of the Four Ming Lords** [南明公宾友].\nSuch figures are many—\nhere, I merely indicate their general ranks.\n(This is the principle for those who established imperial titles—\nthe **Northern Emperor** [北帝] having a **Prime Minister**, just as the **Four Ming Lords** [四明] have **Guests**.)\n\n**Qi Huan Gong** [齐桓公] now holds the post of **Chief Prohibition Officer under the Three Officials** [三官都禁郎],\noverseeing the **registers of life and death** [主生死之简录].\n**Jin Wen Gong** [晋文公] now serves as the **Water Official of the Three Officials** [水官司命].\nThe followers of **Chu Yan Gong** [楚严公] and **Zhao Jianzi** [赵简子], numbering hundreds,\nstill linger as **scattered spirits** [散息] within the **Three Officials’ Bureau** [三官府],\nyet none have been appointed to duty.\nThese ranks are merely the **offices of the Three Officials** [三官之寮]—\nthey have no connection to the **true affairs of the Daoist Immortals** [真仙家事].\n\n(The **Five Hegemons** [五霸] were also heroes of their age—\n**Qi Huan** and **Jin Wen** share key positions,\nwhile **Chu Yan Gong** [楚严公] was the **Zhuang King** [庄王].\nThough **Zhao Jianzi** [简子] did not reach the status of a **Hegemon** [霸限],\nhe wielded absolute authority over life and death.\nThe legend of his dream where **the Heavenly Emperor** [天帝] commanded him to shoot a bear\nmust be the **Northern Emperor’s Bureau** [北帝之府].\nThe **Sword Canon’s Preface** [剑经序] states that **Yan Zhao** [燕昭] also attained **Daoist Immortality** [得仙].\nAs a **sixth-century sovereign** [六国时英主], he thus escaped the **Three Officials’ jurisdiction**.\nThis shows that **pursuing alchemy alone** [鍊丹独往]\nis also an extraordinary distinction.\n\nFrom the discussion of **loyalty and filial piety** [zhōngxiào] onward, all these points\nare drawn from the **Scribe’s writings in the Sword Canon** [掾写剑经].\nThe words of **Lord Dongqing** [东卿司命] on **ghostly and divine matters** [鬼神事]\nare recorded below for verification.\n\nSince the **Three Dynasties** [三代],\nthe **virtuous sages** and **heroes** [贤圣及英雄] have ascended to **Daoist Immortality** [为仙],\nyet in the **ghostly realm** [鬼中], none are seen—\n**no Yi Tang** [殷汤], **no Zhou Gong** [周公], **no Confucius** [孔子].\n\n「King Fuchai—Hòu Lǘ—along with the ministers of the Spring and Autumn period, such as Gōu Jiàn, Wǔ Zǐxù, Sūn Wǔ, Bái Qǐ, and Wáng Jiǎn, and extending down to figures like Hán Xìn and Xiàng Yǔ, some attained the ranks of Daoist Immortality [仙品], yet the Immortal Way [仙家] does not acknowledge them.\n\nTake the tyrants Jié and Jiǔ, or the usurpers Wáng Màng and Dǒng Zhuó—those whose cruelty and depravity were extreme, lest they be denied even the lowest celestial offices [补职僚]. Even the fierce warriors of foreign lands, such as Mòdún, Shí Kuài, and Shí Lè, are omitted from mention [不预及言之].\n\nThe *Zhēn Gào* [真诰]—specifically its sixteenth and seventeenth scrolls—along with the *Wò Zhēn Fǔ* [握真辅], First Chapter of *Xiāo Jì* [萧寂门]—discusses **preserving the spirit and safeguarding the form** [研神保形], **harmonizing the soul and subduing the vital forces** [和魂夷], and **guarding the divine gate of life-nourishment** [守养神关].\n\nHow can such practices be compared to those who dwell in ornate halls, strike gongs and drums, feast upon five great cauldrons, and indulge in fine silks and embroidered garments?\n\nThe **Great Unity** [大罗] and the **common mortal path** [垄樊] are but one and the same.\n\nThus, the **ancient masters of the Dao** [古之高人] all abandoned the latter in favor of the former.」\n\nThe Master Lao remains in tranquil obscurity, unobservant of the clamorous and the keen.\nWhat then of we, the vulgar and unenlightened?\n*(Unknown whence this passage originates, yet containing Daoist speech—\nthus transcribed for reference alone, written by hand.)*\n\n**Xuān Xuān** then expounded, annotating:\n*\"Thus Xuān Xuān took the Eight Winds as the key to the [sacred] bag of stone and wood,\nthe heavens and earth as the [fortified] ramparts,\nthe Four Seas as the [ceremonial] vessel,\nand the Nine Isles as the millet of the [cosmic]

kinds diverging.\nInhaling and exhaling, containing and releasing,\n[the Dao] reveres and honors [life’s] splendor.\"*\n\nHe annotated further:\n*\"The Nine Absolutes—beasts, spirits, birds—\narise from this, yet remain unfathomable.\nTheir brilliance dazzles the eye,\ntheir marvels at their height—\na year insufficient to exhaust their transformations,\nmyriad forms insufficient to contain their depths,\nday and moon insufficient to illuminate their brilliance,\nthe Eight Marshes insufficient to traverse their paths.\nThe Azure Clouds are deemed lowly,\nthe Nine Expanse shallow,\nthe Eight Encompassings small,\nthe Four Poles near.\nThus, in their ceaseless change,\nthey perpetually enter the mustard seed’s interior—\nthe jade morn’s precious gem,\nthe Taiwei’s mighty spirit.\"*\n\n*(Xuān Xuān then expounded further,\ntuning the *gōngbǎi* and *róng* [musical instruments],\nlines drawn from the *Shén Hǔ Yǐnwén Huīshén Shī* [神虎隐文挥神诗].\nNow re-annotated:\nThese words are taken from Yang Xiong’s *Xuānwéi Lùn*,\nwith slight additions and omissions—\nthus aligning with principle and meaning,\nworthy of acceptance.)*\n\nThe heart and governance harmonize within the Great Unity—\nonly the Tang and Yu could fulfill this duty.\nThe spirit and transformation sway beyond all bounds—\nonly Fuxi could inherit this lineage.\n\nThus, the twenty-five-stringed instrument’s craft\nrequires Yajuan’s skill to wield its divine resonance.\nThe bow and arrow’s plain implements\nrequire [Houyi’s] Yǔ [or] Fēngmeng’s mastery to perfect their art.\n*(This passage too is from the *Xuānwéi Lùn*—\nyet unclear what metaphor it illustrates.)*\n\nLike the *Yǐn Bǎopǔ Wàipiān* in its broad metaphors,\nall divergent passages are marked in red for distinction—thus.\n\nAs for the wondrous and mysterious,\nthe strange and the cunning—\nboundless in their guile—\nnurtured by yin and yang,\nconcealed in rivers and marshes—\nthen there is **Hē** and **Hé** bathing the sun in the

City.\nThey now stand on Ba City’s main road to the south,\nwith an inscription on their chest:\n*\"In the twenty-sixth year of the Emperor,\nhe unified all the feudal lords under his rule,\nestablishing commanderies and counties,\nrectifying the laws,\nand standardizing measures and weights.\"*\n\nThe Great One came to take up residence beside the **Water Omen**.\n\nHis stature was five zhang in height.\nHis footprints measured six chi.\nThese were inscribed by Qin Chancellor Meng Tian and Li Si.\n*(The Qin character is missing.)*\n\nFour bronze bells hung in the temple.\nAll were in the Han High Ancestor’s Temple.\nEmperor Ming of Wei relocated two to Luoyang.\nThus, the remaining two stand in the Southern Copper **Masheng** Lane—\nthe **Northern Zhu** bell.\n\nIn Han Zhao’s tomb at Pingling,\nand in Han Xuan’s tomb at Duling,\ntwo bronze bells stood in Chang’an.\nGeneral Xiahou Zhengxi sought to relocate them to Luoyang,\nbut their weight proved insurmountable.\nNow they rest on the southern road of Qingmen.\nThe western one is the Pingling bell,\nthe eastern one the Duling bell.\n*(Here follows the matter of the First Emperor’s tomb.)*\n\nHongmen lies ten-odd li north of the First Emperor’s tomb.\nThe *Han Book* records:\nZhang Liang there resolved his crisis.\nAs Qin King (should be **Chu King**; a mistake, calling him Qin King),\nXiang Yu appointed Stipe’s Duke as **Han King**,\nestablishing his capital at Hanzhong.\nYet he divided Guanzhong into three:\nQin Zhāng Hán as **Yong King**, capital at Daqiu—\nnow Huáilǐ is its site.\nSīmǎ Xīn as **Sài King**, capital at Lìyáng—\nnow Wànyuán County is its site.\nDǒng Yì as the **Yù King**,\ncapital at Gāonú.\nGāonú County lay northwest of Xianyang—\nnow it is **omitted** (or **abbreviated**).\nThe High Ancestor, emerging from Hanzhong to the north,\nraided all three fronts and subdued them.\nThe *Han Book* records this.\n\nExploiting the opportunity to act,\nhe swept through the Three Qin—\nthis was his deed.\nThese three counties today still bear the sites of their ancient capitals.\n*(Hereafter, fifteen or sixteen items are missing—\nclearly lost or omitted.)*\n\n**Du Ling**—the Mausoleum of Emperor Xuan.\nEmperor Xuan, in his youth, took refuge with the Xu family in Du County.\nHe was buried in the Southern Mound,\nand a temple was erected to him north of Qu Pool,\nnamed the **Leyou Temple**—\ntaking its name from the nearby **Wanyuan** estate.\nForty-five noble clans from east of the Pass were relocated here\nto accompany the Du Ling Mausoleum.\n\nSima Xiangru, in his elegy for the Second Emperor, spoke of\nstanding on the **Qujiang’s** [mistaken character] isle—\nmeaning Qu Pool itself.\n*(This entry has been expanded and slightly altered.\nIt is unclear how it came to be thus.)*\n\nThe ten items preceding this\nare all taken from Yang Jun’s transcription of Pan Anren’s *Record of Guanzhong*,\nwritten in fine white paper with elegant cursive script.\nIt seems he merely copied these matters at random.\n\nWithin the Eastern Palace’s precincts,\nthere was a verse recited:\n*\"The small fish not yet cooked in the cauldron—*\n*I weep beneath this rock.\"*\n*(This is a song from the Donghua Palace.)*\n\n*\"The winds obey, the white road opens—*\n*The River Spirit leads the way ahead.\"*\n*(These two lines are from the *Huishen* poem.)*\n\n*\"The Wind Lord does not stir the branches—*\n*The Divine Tiger holds them fast.\"*\n\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month,\nin the blink of an eye,\na voice was heard from the **Dongfang Chamber**:\n*\"Within the crimson canopy,*\n*there sounds like a human voice,*\n*reading aloud like this.\"*\n*(This records the Three True Ones of the Dongfang Chamber,\nalong with the preceding entry—\nall from Yang Jun’s own recollections and experiences.)*\n\nUpon receiving the letter,\nhe knew his heart had been cleansed of guilt,\nand the words expressed deep humility.\nIn reply, he came again,\nZhang Sheng bowed his head.\nThe note was signed: *\"To Master Xu.*\n*I recently learned of your northern journey.*\n*I regret we could not meet in person.*\n*Now I send a single thread of Huang Zhang’s longevity.*\n*Will you truly not come again?\"*\nZhang Sheng bowed his head.\nThe note was signed: *\"To Master Yang.*\n*I dreamed of a woman-like figure,*\n*wearing a feathered robe,*\n*who brought these two folded letters.*\n*Upon opening and reading them,*\n*I awoke—*\n*I recall having heard these words before,*\n*yet much remains forgotten.*\n*Later, I dreamed of burning incense*\n*and entering the inner chamber.\"*\n*(All this records the dream of Zhang Tian Shi’s letter.\nZhang Sheng’s name is thus concealed—\nnow revealed to the Chancellor,\nso it is not openly displayed.\nIt also appears in the *Systematic Commentary on the Laozi*,\nwhere all refer to \"this humble servant bowing in reverence.\"\nPerhaps this too is from Master Xi’s letter.)*\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day of the fourth month, **Xingning** year,\nYang Jun dreamed of a man\nwearing red robes and a peaked cap,\nholding two tablets in his hands,\nand carrying two more in his arms.\nHe summoned Xu Yufu,\nwho stepped forward and presented the tablets—\nall inscribed in green characters.\nYang was then summoned to serve as **Chancellor**.\nIn a moment, Xu Yufu emerged.\nYang pointed and said, *\"This is Master Xu.\"*\nXu Yufu spoke for himself:\n*\"I am to be appointed in the thirteenth year.\nNow I am summoned early—\nI do not yet know the proper etiquette to address others.*\n*If you say so, I can act as a messenger.\"*\nXu Yufu then bowed in submission,\nstill uncertain of the proper rites.\nHe was studying the **Ten Thousand Words** [mistaken character],\nand it would take thirteen years before he could properly serve.\nHe then bowed to Yang and departed.\n*(This half-sheet is a transcription,\nwritten down as Yang Jun recounted his dream.\nThus, it remains within the Yang records.\nThe Chancellor’s position—\nthe one who attends the Emperor at dawn—\nthe tablets inscribed in green—\nthese are the **green bamboo slips and white tablets**.)*\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day of the fourth month, at midnight,\nhe dreamed of sitting beside Xu Yufu,\nthough he knew not where they were.\nAfter a long while...\n\nI saw the **Nanyue** Lady and the **Ziyang** True Person Zhou Jun together arrive.\nThey sat upon a single bed.\nThen I saw Xu Yufu.\nHe spoke to the True Person Zhou Jun, saying,\n*\"I have long heard of Master’s **Guard-One** method.\nI beg to request its transmission.\"*\n\nZhou Jun replied,\n*\"My former teacher, Master Su, once said to me,\n‘To seek the True through the Dao—is this not overly roundabout?\nLet me raise this point with you now.’\"*\n\nXu Yufu said,\n*\"My aspirations are shallow and limited.\nI covet the **Dao** and **virtue**,\nso I wish to beg for the **Guard-One** method.\"*\n\nBefore he finished speaking,\nZhou Jun again said,\n*\"What was once not transmitted through the **Dao**\nwas merely because of the **bounded exchanges** of mortal men.\n*(Zhou was from Ruyin. A seventh-generation descendant of Han Grand Commandant Bo. Hence, he is called a **bounded man**.)*\nYou are a **True Person**—\nand already possess great transmission.\nWhy would you seek to **Guard-One** further?\"*\n\nHaving spoken, he suddenly awoke,\nyet did not know where he was.\nThis dream was exceedingly clear,\nso I recorded it.\n**Fourth month, ninth day, on the night of the fourth watch,**\nI dreamed of traveling north and ascending a high mountain.\nLost and disoriented, I did not awaken.\nOnly when the sun rose four or five *zhang* did I wake.\nUpon waking, I recalled climbing the mountain for half a day,\nreaching the summit, where there were thousands of palaces,\nso vast they defied description.\nThe mountain’s four sides were encircled by great waters,\nyet I did not know where I was.\n\nI then looked upward,\nand in the sky saw a white dragon,\nits body tens of *zhang* long,\nflying eastward through the heavens,\nits radiance dazzling the sky.\nThen I saw, to the east, a fair woman in white robes,\nalso moving through the air,\nfacing west toward the white dragon.\nShe entered its mouth,\nemerged again,\nand did so three times before stopping.\nShe then returned to my right,\nfacing me.\nTo my left stood an old man,\nwearing embroidered robes and a lotus-crowned cap,\nleaning on a nine-jointed red staff.\nBoth gazed at the white dragon.\n\nI asked the old man,\n*\"What kind of woman enters the dragon’s mouth?\"*\nHe replied,\n*\"This is the **Taisu** Jade Maiden, Xiao Zifu.\nShe takes the dragon to refine her form.\nThis person appears to be **Fangxiang**, an official.\"*\n\nI asked again,\n*\"Who is this old man?\nWhy has he come to this place?\"*\nHe answered,\n*\"I am the **Penglai** Celestial Lord Luo Guangxiu.\nThis is **Penglai Mountain**.\nI govern its heights.\nThe **Fu Lord** came to visit,\nand thus we were able to meet.\"*\n\nI asked the old man again,\n*\"Can this dragon be ridden?\"*\nHe replied,\n*\"This dragon awaits the **True Person** Zhang Youshi,\nShi Qing’an,\nand Xu Yufu.\"*\n\nI asked again,\n*\"Is it one dragon that the four are riding together?\"*\nThe old man replied,\n*\"This is a dragon that serves the Morning Emperor.\nIt is like the world’s **Zhāochē** chariot drawn by the Vermilion Bird—\neach day, one rides it to ascend directly.\nIn a moment, the old man called these four worthies.\nBefore they arrived, I spread out a mat with you, the old man, and this maiden,\nand we sat together on the mountain, all facing north,\ngazing at the sea and the white dragon.\nThere was also wine and food set before us.\nThe wine was like pomegranate seeds,\nand we ate them together.\nThe **mùbàn** was also like the world’s **mùbàn**,\nand within the **mùbàn** was salmon.\nAfter a long while, the four arrived from the east,\nriding a fresh **niúcē** chariot,\nwith green oxen and green oil—\na grand carriage that came before us.\nThey bowed to the old man and to me,\nand spoke with us.\nAfter their words concluded,\nthe old man said, ‘The four men I spoke of earlier—\nthese are they.’\nI saw that Zhang Youshi was about fifty years old,\nShi Qing’an was very youthful, around thirteen or fourteen,\nXu Yufu was the same age as I saw him today,\nand Ding **Yùwéi** Ning was about thirty-four or five.\nAll wore fine single robes,\nwith **jīnzé** hanging down and **bān** sandals.\nOnly Qing’an wore an empty **jīnzé**.\"*\n\nI said, \"Not so.\"\nThe old man replied, \"Zhang Youshi is a man of Changshan.\nHe is my disciple.\nShi Qing’an is a man of Ji Province.\nHe is the disciple of the Lady Gouyi.\nTheir talents are equal, their virtue matched—\nboth are esteemed among men of letters.\nThe old man then addressed the four, saying,\n‘You may each compose a poem\nto display your skill before the Master.\nI too wish to hear your refined words of literary beauty.’\n\nAt this, the old man gave each a sheet of green paper,\nand a brush to each as well,\nto present to the four.\nThe four took them and said,\n‘We fear our haste may betray us.’\n\nThen Shi Qing’an composed his poem first.\nIts words were:\n*\"The Ling Mountain crafts the dawn’s radiance,\nThe upright cliffs pierce the celestial peaks.\nPurple mists drift across the land of gods,\nRiding the gale, harnessed to the white dragon.\nHand in hand, we four guests arrive,\nTo the eastern hall of the Master of Sanglin.\nThough my years are few, my heart is vast—\nWhat wisdom do I bring?\nI have not yet descended to yield the path.\nOnly in mutual reverence do we meet.\"*\n\nNext, Zhang Youshi composed his poem.\nIts words were:\n*\"To the north, I wandered beyond the Great Desert,\nTo climb the gates of Penglai.\nPurple clouds met the Ling Palace’s halls—\nFragrant mists, how thick they rise!\nAh, splendid is the Master’s virtue!\nLong have I dwelt in his Dao’s embrace.\nThe True Ones gather in their ranks,\nTogether observing the white dragon’s stride.\nWhen shall we four loosen our belts and part?\nI have a friend in whom I take delight—\nJoyful mornings we share in his company.\"*\n\nThen Xu Yufu composed his poem.\nIts words were:\n*\"I wander through mountains of marvelous height,\nRinsing in the clear currents of the Stygian Sea.\nFrom afar, I gaze upon Penglai’s realm—\nTowering peaks pierce the heavens’ depths.\nPurple mushrooms cloak the vermilion cliffs,\nFour steps planted with fragrant *linyu* [citrus].\nSwirling mists of divine splendor drift,\nGleaming radiance fills the halls of gods.\nBeyond the Seven Awakenings’ bounds,\nI freely grasp the mysteries of Heaven’s birth.\nSufficient lies within my heart’s measure—\nWhy seek the white dragon’s glory?\"*\n\nLast, Ding Yùwéi Ning composed his poem.\nIts words were:\n*\"The Black Mountain frames the Stygian waves,\nThe golden halls reflect the Ling Chamber’s light.\nThe Duke of Luo upholds his singular virtue—\nGraceful ease in all he does.\nHis form rests in the northern cold,\nThree divine ones dwell in the Nine Heavens.\nTogether we lodge, then journey forth,\nPraising your years of highest attainment.\nThough I was but youthful in my twenties,\nI did not yet revere the worthy.\nMocking the Master of Penglai,\nI called him ‘Broad Rest’ before.\nNow, Master, what shall you do?\nTo dismiss this youth’s brushstrokes?\nThe four finished their poems,\nand each presented his to the old man.\nAfter reading them, he laughed and said,\n‘Each poem reveals their unique talent and nature.\nShi Qing’an has an unconventional brilliance yet moves lightly.\nZhang Youshi’s verse is harmonious but hard to fathom.\nXu Yufu is cautious and full of doubt.\nDing Yùwéi Ning is naturally withdrawn but slow to express himself.\nTo move lightly is to lack depth.\nTo be hard to fathom is to not grasp the Dao.\nTo doubt excessively is to think without divine insight.\nTo express oneself slowly is to miss the soul’s brilliance—\nThese are the paths of difference.\nIf each could return from their confusion,\nAnd awaken to what they truly know,\nThey would not fall short.\nThe Master’s disciples—when they request to discuss doubts,\nDoubt is what blinds them from divine insight.’\n\nAfter the poems concluded,\neach took up their staff and descended the mountain.\nAs they descended...\n\nThe Master then saw this woman riding a white dragon depart to the north.\nI and the others walked southward.\nUpon reaching the mountain’s foot, each parted ways.\nThe Master said, *\"In twenty years’ time,\nwe shall meet again at the Seven Arts Hall—\nto wander this place once more.\"*\nAt these words, I suddenly awoke to understanding,\nmy brow beaded with sweat.\nFor the rest of the day, I could neither eat nor drink.\n\nHalfway down the mountain,\nI saw Xu the Clerk ascending.\nWe met between the cliffs.\nThe Master spoke to the Clerk, *\"Why do you come so late?\nI have set aside four pints of wine\nat the place where I sat on the mountain.\nGo drink it, then return to follow me.\"*\nThe Clerk immediately went up the mountain.\nIn a short while, he returned,\nmoving swiftly.\nBefore he reached the foot, the Master met him again.\nThe Master said, *\"Did you not drink the fine wine?\"*\nThe Clerk replied, *\"I still regret its sourness.\"*\nThe Master said, *\"This is wine from the House of Great Peace—\nit soothes the human intestines.\"*\nThe Clerk exclaimed, *\"If one seeks longevity,\nwhy should they drink the House of Great Peace?\nWhat sourness could there be?\"*\nThus, he is but a rustic child.\nHold fast to your single resolve,\ntake no heed of trifles.\nLater, I shall rely on you\nto assist and shelter me.*\n\nThe Clerk and I then went east together.\nThe Master returned to the mountain.\nThe other three departed westward fifty paces.\nThe Master sent a messenger to inform me:\n*\"Xu the Clerk will serve as my toothpick.\"*\nI replied, *\"I have no objection.\"*\n\nTo the tenth night.\nI first composed a memorial on this dream.\nThe Master reported it to the sages.\nUpon receiving this strange dream,\nthey were as clear as if they had not slept.\nThey did not discern what wish it might convey.\n\nOnly **Zǐwēi** Lady replied:\n*\"Your true nature is inwardly stirred—\nspirit seeks far and wide,\ndivinity descends from the Eight Mysteries,\nyour form soars with your soul.\nThis is indeed the omen of supreme attainment.\nThe matter reveals the hidden depths—\nnot a vain fabrication.\nAs the **Luó** Master spoke,\nyou may discreetly inform **Yùfǔzi** and the others.\nDo not widely proclaim the sacred intent within.\nThis is no small matter.\nTake great care.\n\nThe other sages laughed.\n**Qīnglíng** said:\n*\"It is through the **míng** of the **míng** that you perceive this.\nYour heart resonates with piercing clarity—\nthe power of **Nányuè** Lord.\"*\n\n(The matter of this dream was later written down in the eastern region.\nSince I did not see the original myself,\nI do not know who composed it.\nThe place mentioned is where **Yáng** Lord was to write this and present it to the **Chángshǐ**.\nThus, it is said to be *mine*.\nThis was in the fourth month, possibly the year **Yǐchǒu**,\nor it could also be the year **Yín**.)\n\nOn the twenty-third night of the tenth month.\n\nThe dream took place on a vast mountain.\nSomeone appeared and told me,\n*\"This is the Great Cave of Mount Móng.\nThe chamber is square, with seats facing each other.\nAll are made of cypress beds with dragon-scaled mats.\nThe walls are inscribed with countless texts, yet they cannot be deciphered.\nThe Chángshǐ is dressed in a coarse hemp robe and white undergarment.\nHe sits facing west, his back to the east.\nThere are three others, all in embroidered robes with flat caps.\nOne of them declares:\n‘I am the father of Zhào Shǔtái—\nyou once saw me in Wù.’\n(As recorded in the *Dìnglù*: ‘In the past, Zhào Shǔtái, known as Wáng Shìqīng, was said to be deeply learned.\nYet he never understood human intentions,\nand was summoned to serve the Northern Míng Lord’s court.\nThis seems to be his son,\nbut I do not know which era he belongs to.’)\nI sit facing south, my back to the north.\nThe Chángshǐ kneels before me.\nTaking up the brush, I begin to write,\nthen pause in deep contemplation.\nAfter a long while, I finish.\nHe immediately asks:\n‘May this writing be passed on?’\nI reply:\n*\"The Dao of the sun and moon—\nwith reverence, I bow twice.\nNow, I offer a fine painting, a wine cup, and a tray of food from the south.\nNext year’s sixth month,\nyou may enter the city.\"*\n\nThe matter of dispatching—\nhow excellent, how excellent!\nThe appointed time of water and fire\nseeks me on the day of the great tree.\n\n*(Shèng is still the sound of Chéng.\nIn the Han, there was also a man named this.)*\n\nThere are those who study yet fail to grasp it—\nnever has there been one who attained it without study.\nTruly, this saying is true!\n\nThe Chángshǐ then wrote it upon green paper\nand showed it to me.\n*(Within the text, it says:\n‘This writing is made\nto carve one’s name.’)*\n\nDēng Nán asked: ‘What is meant by *guō*?’\nThe Chángshǐ replied: ‘It is like a *guō* within the cave—\nnot the *guō* of a tomb.’\n\nAgain he asked: ‘Why *qián*?’\nThe reply came: ‘*Qián* is the beginning of reverence.\nBelow, there are characters—\nthe written form of reverence.’\n\nAgain he asked: ‘Why *shèng*?’\nThe answer was: ‘*Shèng* is the servant beneath the sun—\nthe sun completes, and the moon attains.’\n\nThe three men in brocade robes together exclaimed:\n‘Fortunate! Fortunate!\nStudy cannot deceive the coming and going of the Dao’s appointed time.’\n\n*(This entire passage is from what Yang Zì recorded in a dream—\nunknown which year it was.\nIt speaks of entering the *guō* in the sixth month,\nbut the omen remains unmeasured.\nThe upper half of this line was clipped away—\nit should be the naming of one’s own name.)*\n\nMaster Xù, in days past, concealed his brilliance and withdrew from the world,\nhis light hidden in the ninth heaven.\nIn the dark, he observed the divine—\nhis radiance illuminated the spirit’s hall.\n\nFortunate! Fortunate!\nIn days gone by, our intimate exchanges,\nour entwined oaths,\ntranscended the crowd—\na lone awakener, forging his own path beyond.\n\nMaster was then thirty years old when Great Yang was thirty.\nWhen Master first entered Dongshan, Yang was but sixteen.\nWhen he vanished from the world, Yang was nineteen—\nthus did Yang’s devotion to the Dao begin so young.\n\nSince parting from the radiant dust of the world,\ntoday I gaze eastward across the Milky Way,\ntears falling before words.\nI imagine the Mysterious Palace in harmonious fusion,\nits auspicious governance now complete.\nAt this moment, riding the Eight Winds,\nit sweeps away all dross and obscurity.\nThe Six Heavens exert their might,\ndispelling demonic *qi*.\nMay the true and authentic faith\nspread through the Three Epochs.\nThe boundless sentiment of the Void\ntransforms endlessly.\n\nBefore your departure, you often expressed concern,\nthinking of dreams you had seen.\nYou entrusted me with your handwritten traces as proof.\nSince then, I have felt the hidden communion—\nafter receiving the inscription,\ntime seemed to vanish in an instant,\nas if a thousand years had passed,\nyet I was able to obtain it.\nHow strange and inexplicable!\nTruly, how subtle and wondrous!\nTruly, how subtle and wondrous!\n\nThis is what I recently dreamed, as recorded in my sparse notes.\nI now reveal it in secret.\n*(This was written after Master was tested—\nYang sent it to him in reply.\nOn fine hemp paper, exquisitely preserved—\nthis is the original manuscript, hence its survival.)*\n\nXī respectfully bows, bows again.\nIn the cold darkness,\nI humbly inform you:\nYour body remains in harmony, bringing comfort.\nI have yet to pay my respects in person.\nRespectfully, I write no more.\nYang Xī respectfully bows, bows again.\nXī reports:\nYour third daughter came yesterday to offer a *jìngsài* rite.\nToday, she is slightly better,\nthough still not fully recovered.\n\nThe multitude’s mood is turbulent and restless.\nTheir movements and stillness alike bring news of distress.\nThe recent plague and pestilence are most dreadful,\nYet still they do not cease.\nThis only adds to my profound anxiety.\n\nTo the *Giving Officer* Xu, Lord of the Prefectural Household, *(these six characters written on the back of a folded paper)*\nXī respectfully reports:\nThe two minor official matters were recently settled due to the dismissal of the Chief Clerk, who was transferred to Zheng’s Western Chamber.\nZheng’s Western Chamber also happened to be where he was stationed.\nBut the affairs were not yet fully completed.\nOnce finished, they would be submitted to the superior.\nI now consider this a matter of personal sentiment.\nThis passage was composed for the descendants of Chen Zouwang and Rong Yi—\nIndeed, it was a well-crafted work.\n\nRespectfully, *(this letter lost its upper sheet)*\nXī bows, bows again.\nI humbly inform you:\nYour body remains in harmony, bringing comfort.\nLast night, a messenger from the Liu family departed.\nTheir concern seems like that of the bereaved in mourning.\nTomorrow morning, Xī will accompany the Chief Clerk to the tomb to pay respects.\nPerhaps later I may visit again.\nYang Xī bows, bows again.\n\nThe other day, I also received a carriage inquiry.\nI suspect it was not properly examined.\nAt least, it was sent with *heartfelt* urgency.\nThis is not the doing of one who delves into the Dao’s profound treasures,\nBut rather the natural course of things.\nTo the *Longshì* Xu, Lord of the Prefectural Household, *(these six characters written on the back of the paper as well)*\n\nXī respectfully reports:\nI received silk fabric,\nWhich I will use to make summer clothing for my aged mother.\nTruly, this is a gracious favor akin to the Western Marquis’s care for the elderly.\nYet Xī’s reception of kindness is excessive and beyond measure.\nThe honor flows far beyond what I deserve.\nI can only bear the debt of gratitude,\nWith nothing to offer in return.\nAs for the gift of silk and cloth,\nIt is not what I should accept.\nEven a modest offering of filial piety\nWould suffice for my own needs.\nRespectfully, I return it.\nI hope you will deeply understand.\n\nXī respectfully reports.\nXī respectfully reports.\nThis place was once pure and serene,\nNow free of dust and filth.\nMoreover, the residence of the young clerk is fine.\nBut Xī will soon depart,\nUnable to stay long and share company.\n\nI will report again later.\nXī respectfully reports.\n*(These two entries were written on the same sheet, and it seems the upper sheet was lost.)*\n\nXī bows, bows again.\nIn the cold hours of the night,\nI humbly inform you:\nYour body remains in harmony, bringing comfort.\nThis is my final report after returning from the visit.\nYang Xī bows, bows again.\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nI received a letter from the Chief Clerk:\n\"Strange affairs in the wilderness.\nThe *Xīyì* letter was answered separately.\nI paid respects on the 2nd day of the 2nd month.\nRespectfully reported.\"\n*(The back of this letter has no inscription. Fear the lower sheet may be lost.)*\n\nXī bows, bows again.\nToday’s report again fails to dispel the *wind-dryness*.\nI humbly inform you:\nYour body remains in harmony, bringing comfort.\n\n---\n\nI humbly submit a letter in response to your earnest inquiry.\nI do not presume to elaborate further.\nYang Xī bows, bows again.\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nThe *Cloud Zhi* Dao is not to be entrusted with this letter to be delivered.\nXī will personally attend to it.\nRespectfully reported.\nTo the Honorable Chief Administrator Xu, Sir.\n\n*(Attendant reports: These nine characters are inscribed on the back of a folded sheet. The letter from the Master and Yang Xī: The upper sheet bears repeated bows, while the lower sheet includes the single petition and the respectful report. Moreover, the self-reference to \"Your body\" is used, which may be explained by the irregularity of the ritual. It is neither the intent of a subordinate nor the proper conduct of a teacher and disciple. This is simply the expression of deference to one's superiors in age or rank, and the attendant's title reflects their duty. It is not a fixed rule that one must always adhere to—it should be adapted according to circumstances and cannot be strictly taken as [standard] practice.)*\n\nXī bows, bows again.\nOn a fortunate day, my wishes are fulfilled.\nThough I have not yet paid my respects, I am deeply moved.\nI humbly inform you:\nYour body remains in harmony, bringing comfort.\nXī has now finished burning incense.\nYou should temporarily return home to rest in stillness.\nIn the evening, I will personally open [the letter].\nRespectfully reported, without further elaboration.\nYang Xī bows, bows again.\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nThere has been no recent inquiry about the wilderness.\nYet the new wife of Hua is indeed well.\nI still hang my heart on the 2nd day of the 2nd month for paying respects.\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nI am grateful for today’s gift of rice.\nYesterday, I already dispatched Chen [with provisions] for food and drink.\nThey will remain to guard and observe [the matter].\nRespectfully reported.\n\nLong History Master, Lord Xu:\n\n*(These six characters inscribed on the folded paper’s reverse—\nto be answered while in the mountain retreat. The fifth day of the tenth month.)*\n\nXī respectfully reports:\nThe official reply has been completed, yet I forgot to send it.\nJust as I was about to dispatch a messenger,\nI received word and now seal it for delivery.\nA proper copy will also be transcribed and submitted separately.\n\nI am uncertain whether the prescribed *chóngwán* (虫丸) remedy has been taken as directed.\nIf it remains unfinished, should the course begin anew upon the coming year?\nAs for what I previously obtained,\nI divided and took it daily as usual—no irregularities were observed.\nOnly at the outset, for six or seven days,\nI felt a warmth in the head and a surging heat in the abdomen.\nBeyond that, nothing else.\nPerhaps the effects are gradually taking hold.\nRespectfully reported.\n\nXī respectfully reports:\nThe Chief Clerk, the virtuous scholar-official,\nremains here under my care, though only slightly comforted.\nThe junior clerk, alone in that distant place,\nmust surely feel deep longing.\nThese past days, my thoughts have followed him,\nmy yearning beyond words.\nThe household affairs are, for now, manageable.\nI humbly request your continued concern.\n\nXī respectfully reports:\nYesterday and today, there were replies to be answered,\nyet I was in a distracted state.\nOnly now, having just received your handwritten letter\nand heard the full account,\nwill I present it properly.\nUpon opening it, I will make it known.\n\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nXī respectfully reports:\nI humbly inform you of all recent developments,\never awaiting your guidance.\nYour labor has kept me restless in thought.\nXī respectfully reports.\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nThe colored papers remain with the young scholar.\nI dare not let them be lost.\nXī respectfully reports.\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nTomorrow I shall go to East Mountain.\nThe Chief Clerk says he will accompany me.\nThere is also a matter of the kitchen staff to resolve.\nThe young scholar also lacks a horse.\nXī will answer the Master today.\nThe Master instructs that tomorrow I should first think of arranging a carriage together to deliver the matter.\nI do not know if Your Honor’s horse can be obtained to send me here.\nThe grass here is easier to manage than in the capital.\nMay he be fortunate and not need it.\nI am now arranging the *Three Virtues* (三秀).\nIt is a matter of several days.\nXī respectfully reports.\n*(The following five letters are all previous responses to the Prefect while in the county.\nSome are single petitions, others may have lost the original letter.)*\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nThe Master’s household, Xī heard, yesterday and today hosted a visit from Master Xu.\nThe Master’s household was still modest in its arrangements.\nHe did not even realize how long I should have been departing.\nZhang Hong continued to arrive.\nAt that time, the day was still manageable.\nXī humbly informs:\nEntering the gate to support the Master’s affairs,\nthis was indeed a rare and unusual matter.\nBecause Xī could not properly restrain myself in drink and food,\nI failed to measure the appropriate time to send guests away.\nI am deeply ashamed and fearful.\nI hope Your Honor will again examine and pardon me.\nXī respectfully reports.\n*(This matter was addressed in the capital to the Prefect,\nwhile I was still in the Military Protectorate.)*\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nI have now compiled and collected about fifty people.\nI have also drafted the *True Record* (叙真).\nThis should be seen as a benefit.\nThe followers of *Mystic Depth* (味玄),\nif they can encourage and exhort me,\nI am truly moved.\nXī heard that this should be far more than what I have done.\nIn the evening, I will overturn my bundle to search for materials,\nand send those I obtain.\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nI have already prepared paper and writing implements.\nWhen finished,\nI will personally write one copy.\nI wish to send it to Master Shi.\nI wish it not to be seen by others.\n*(This should be the case of the *Shi’s Rectification* (白石耳).\nOr perhaps it is the *Five Officials’ Fat Law* (五公腴法).\nFrom this letter onward, Master Yang’s records are all matters after the Clerk’s death.\nI do not know who collected and preserved them—\nperhaps it was Huang Min from his elder’s household.)*\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nThe *Han Records* (汉书) mention the *Chief of the Season* (季主事),\nyet do not describe his difficulties.\nThe *Master of the Hills* (稽山公) composed the *Biographies of High Scholars* (高士传).\nIf they are as refined and modest,\nI will copy the *Master of the Hills’* draft of the *Chief of the Season*’s biography\nand present it as though it were separate.\nXī respectfully submits.\nThe *Scriptures of the Secluded Chamber* (洞房先进经) have already been written.\nI will deliver them as Your Honor commands, requesting Master Wang Edict (王旷) to retrieve them.\n*(Alternative: \"I have already reported.\")*\nFor fear of forgetting, Xī respectfully reports again.\n*(The red paper and books I now possess are these.)*\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nI received Your Honor’s letter yesterday during the rain,\nand could not visit.\nI thought tomorrow I would surely be able to comply.\nIf the weather clears, I will temporarily pay my respects before reporting.\nXī respectfully reports.\n*(These three letters seem to have lost the original letter;\nall were written in the capital.)*\nXī respectfully bows, respectfully bows.\n\nIt is still cold and clear.\nXī humbly informs:\nI am relieved to hear Your Honor’s body is in harmony.\nI will again personally open and read the letter upon my return.\n*(Incomplete.)*\nYang Xī respectfully bows, respectfully bows.\n\nPrefect Xu, Lord of the Allowance (长史许府君侯).\n*(Attendant reports.)*\n\nThis letter of nine characters (written on folded paper, backside):\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nMaster Jì excels in profound learning,\nand his Dao/Way is most sublime.\nThus, should he not be placed at the very beginning of the scroll?\nThe Honorable Lord of the Eastern Prefecture sighed greatly at Master Jì’s character,\nand also admired his lofty and daring spirit.\n\nThe collection is now roughly complete.\nIt should soon be ready for viewing.\nThough I have not yet seen the Honorable Lord’s letter,\nI already rejoice and marvel at it.\nI will humbly present it in one or two days.\nXī respectfully reports.\n\n*(The text I wrote on the Eastern Prefecture’s praise of Master Jì’s deeds\nwas originally inscribed on separate green paper,\nnot included with this letter.\nIt is now found in the fourth section.)*\nThe collection should ideally be completed for seventy-two individuals.\nI do not know how many have already been recorded.\nIf the number is few,\nI should also consider invoking the unseen (冥中)\nto seek their likenesses.\nHowever, I have only drafted a portion.\nI will proceed gradually.\nIt cannot yet be finalized.\nI also wish to personally copy one complete draft\nto present to the Honorable Lord.\nThe Honorable Lord has always cherished this endeavor,\nhoping to fulfill it with sincere devotion.\nXī respectfully reports.\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nKǒng Ānguó compiled the seventy-two disciples of Confucius.\nLiú Xiàng compiled the seventy-two immortals (列仙).\nHuángfǔ Shì’ān compiled the seventy-two high-sage masters (高士宗).\nChén Chángwén compiled the seventy-two elders (耆旧).\n*(These are the elders of Chénliú. This book is complete in form but lacks a title—likely sealed in an envelope.)*\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nI recall another matter on separate paper—\nit is most excellent.\nIt can be included in the transmitted records (传中).\nI await the Honorable Lord’s command\nto inquire and request the names and surnames.\nI must also see the Honorable Lord of the Eastern Prefecture.\nThis month, I should complete it without fail.\nXī will report as circumstances allow.\n*(This letter also lost its original paper.\nThe words were written in response to the initial sending of the *Godly Immortals’ Records*.\nThe Honorable Lord’s command must await his arrival.\nAgain, this seems written while in the county,\nnot in the capital.)*\n\nThe *Godly Immortals’ Records* still lack proper revision.\nI must await the Honorable Lord of the Eastern Prefecture’s arrival\nto present them respectfully.\nYesterday, I again humbly read them,\nrepeating them three times,\nso I could name them properly.\nI was moved by their grandeur.\nThe messenger awaits clear weather to deliver them.\nXī respectfully reports.\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nThe *Records* have not yet been inscribed to Master Wáng.\nThe reason for this is\nthat I wish to present them to the Honorable Lord of the Eastern Prefecture.\nSince he has not yet arrived,\nI cannot yet begin this.\nI will present them upon his later visit.\nYour Honor’s office already has a copy.\nI do not know if this copy should be kept here.\nI also wish to submit further records.\nOnce all are submitted,\nI will humbly return them all together.\nXī respectfully reports.\n\n*(This *Godly Immortals’ Records* by the Prefect’s attendant\nwere never revealed to the world.\nI do not understand how this came to be.\nPerhaps the Honorable Lord forbade me to disclose the true matter,\ncausing me to conceal and abandon it.)*\n\nI do not know if the reclusive scholar (方隅山中幽人) in the distant hills\nhas already arranged a seat for me at the Easy Migration’s household (易迁户).\nXī humbly inquires.\n*(The reclusive scholar refers to the county magistrate.\nThe Honorable Lord has set up a symbolic seat in his mother’s home.)*\n\nThe messenger still requires a cow.\nTomorrow, after the meal is finished, I will send him away.\n*(This letter lost its original paper—likely sealed in an envelope.\nIt was written while in the county.)*\nXī respectfully bows.\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nI have taken the Honorable Lord’s medicine for three days,\nand my body feels at ease.\nThis is a great relief.\nI wish Your Honor’s body to remain harmonious\nand free from further strain.\nRecently, I have been busy with both public and private affairs,\nso I humbly presented this brief report.\nYang Xī respectfully bows, respectfully bows.\n\nI have been troubled by an illness for two years.\nRecently, I received the *Sutra of the Lion’s Roar*.\nIt does not mention any ailment.\nThis must be a minor affliction.\nI will send a messenger to inquire about it on a clear day.\nXī respectfully reports.\n\nI have accepted Master Shí’s visit.\nXī now recognizes him.\nRecently, there have been many sudden deaths.\n*(This letter also lacks a title—likely written in the capital.)*\n\nYang Yi respectfully bows, respectfully bows.\nI humbly report.\n\nI have seen the *Dream Commentary* and the full account of the memorial.\nUpon careful reconsideration,\nthe dream is indeed a matter of *qi* disturbance,\nand the memorial has also reached its conclusion.\nI am deeply moved by this.\n\nI suspect this is the work of malevolent spirits.\nThey will soon disperse and vanish.\nRecently, I have been attending court.\nYang Yi respectfully bows, respectfully bows.\n\nThe separate memorial should not be shown to others.\nThe grievances you mentioned—\nI have humbly reported a few in my memorial.\nAs for the *Dream Commentary*,\nit should now be resolved.\n\nHowever, fundamentally, this is a disturbance of *qi*.\nI respectfully report.\n\nRecently, I too dreamed of a minor official.\nHe spoke of something,\nbut it was nothing of consequence.\nI also no longer trust dreams to enlighten me,\nso I did not report it.\n\nYour illness—though precious as jade—remains unresolved.\nIt is likely due to minor disturbances of *qi*.\nThe memorial’s foundation is complete,\nand it should be sufficient to dispel this.\n\nI respectfully report.\nI report.\n\nEarlier, I received fine white silk, blue paper, and fragrant beads from the minor official.\nHowever, these are mere superstitions of leftist heresies.\nThus, I no longer speak of them.\n\nThe appointed time for this matter shall indeed be the *jiashen* year.\n\nAll the grievances—\nMy pen cannot fully express them.\nI respectfully report.\n\n*(Since the minor official departed,*\n*Yang has often experienced supernatural communications.*\n*The Longshi has always remembered him,*\n*so Yang has repeatedly encountered him.*\n*In this world, many do not believe in the hidden and manifest.*\n*Thus, I did not wish to speak of it fully.*\n*Since then, it has been the ninth year of Taiyuan and the twenty-first year of Yuanjia—*\n*two jiashen years have already passed.*\n*I do not know which jiashen year this refers to—*\n*is it the jiashen year after four cycles of dinghai?)*\n\nI humbly bow, bow again.\nI respectfully inform you:\n\nYour body remains unwell,\nand my own ailments—precious as jade—\npersist in their disturbances.\nMy concern burns intensely.\nI suspect this is due to occasional harm.\nYou wish to submit a memorial to explain yourself,\nwhich would also suffice to sever the harm of malevolent *qi*.\n\nDreams should not be blindly trusted—\none must only steady the mind to calm them.\n\nLater, I recovered and returned to normal.\nYang humbly bows, bows again.\n\nI received news that the *jiyezhe* has returned.\nI rejoice.\nYou have already met with him.\nI inquire about the details—\nI respectfully report.\n\nSince the minor official’s passing,\n*(cough)*[omitted]—\nnot a month passes without dreams.\nI have dreamed of him ten times.\nEven in sleep,\nhis form appears with grievances.\nHis words and deeds\nare as if he were still alive.\nYet, since I no longer believe,\nnear and far mock me.\nI dare not speak of it again.\n\nNow, I fully recount the dream,\nmerely to inform you again.\nI hope you will not take offense.\nIf you believe this to be mere delusion,\nI hope you will return it to me,\nand I will immediately burn it.\n\n*(This letter has no title.\nIt was also sealed in an envelope.\nThe minor official would often come in person to record it with me,\nusing sleep and dreams as a pretext.\nAt the time, among the noble guests,\nsome heard that Yang could commune with spirits.\nBelievers often sought his answers,\nwhile skeptics ridiculed him.)*\n\nThus, this account is recorded in *Zhenyue* Scroll Seventeen, *Zhenyue* Scroll Eighteen, and *Wozhenfu* Chapter Two. On the nineteenth night of the third month, I dreamed that a junior clerk came and sat quietly here. After a long while, he spoke of the Three Meetings at the waters of Xiaomao Mountain—how splendid the performances were. He said he had come from the Four Flat Mountains, and along the way, he saw his uncle holding a torch in his hand, intending to create mischief. He told me, *\"Master, you should instruct Alang: such ghostly flames make people’s mouths shut tight, unable to speak. This thing transforms into wind. Do you know this?\"*\n\nThe junior clerk further said, *\"The grass on Fang Mountain is truly excellent—unusually fine. Its leaves are vast. I took much of it yesterday, but recently lost the cloth wrapping. I wish to beg this cloth from you, Master.\"* (The junior clerk and his younger brother both died early. I do not know who this might be. Fang Mountain is the Four Flat Mountain, where the leisurely retreat of Fangyuan was once shared with Long Bohao and others. After gathering the southern torchgrass, he also begged for the cloth wrapping—those in the caves still require clothing and food, hence the saying.)\n\nDu Guangping likewise cut firewood to trade for grain. How much more so the scholars dwelling above the caves? Truly, they would not fail to know the practice of fasting to abstain from grains—it is simply that they ought not to do so.\n\nThe junior clerk further said, *\"The burial site is now unauspicious. Cutting off the tomb’s *mai* brings many ill omens.\"* (This was dreamed on the nineteenth evening. Thus, what was recorded earlier in the text—what was written in white—was as follows: the clerk also returned to bury his remains in the old tomb, though it was an empty grave, yet still requiring a propitious site.)\n\nThis is the end of the letter to the *changshi* (Master of Records). What remains of the true handwritten text concludes here. (One line is missing before this, and the two preceding characters are also lost.)\n\nMy heartfelt sentiments cannot be fully expressed. Upon reflection, I received word and roughly agreed. I soon went to visit, and our reunion is near. Recently, I have been in a state of anxious anticipation—truly beyond words.\n\nThe *jishì* (Assistant Minister) An He (who is the *changshi*) will depart from Nanzhou on the nineteenth day and return on the twenty-second. The *gongcao* (Functionary) has already entered the capital. Yesterday, we met and comforted each other’s hearts. (The *gongcao* is the clerk’s elder brother, whose childhood name was Kui.)\n\nAt that moment, my mind was wandering—my return had not yet been completed. Shall I invoke the *yin* virtue of the zither strings? Let me offer a lighthearted smile instead. (The zither strings matter is from the *Peng Su Jing*—a text on the *fangzhong* arts.)\n\nThis is all for today. Tomorrow, the *gong* (my lord) will again depart for Nanzhou to bid farewell to the *dà sīmǎ* (Grand Marshal). The *dà sīmǎ* will set out on the twenty-sixth. The seventh seems unlikely to join the campaign. (The *gong* is Simwen, serving as *sītú* (Grand Tutor). The *dà sīmǎ* is Huan Wen, stationed in Juxu, preparing to launch a northern expedition against the Murong. The seventh is likely the clerk’s younger brother, whose childhood name was Sìbó, then serving as *shàngshū láng* (Secretary of State). This was in the third month of the fourth year of *Tàihé*—the year *jǐsì*.)\n\n「Thus he sends me far away with the rice.\nIs it to prepare for the *dòngzhāi* (Great Cavern Ritual)?\nIf the Master were to refine the *xiánjìng* (Mystic Mirror) in distant lands,\nto purify the voice and ascend the lofty tones,\ndwelling in the depths of the forest,\nfar from worldly affairs,\nthen this matter would never come to pass.\nBut now I hear it—truly, the *dharma* is complete.\n\n（The *dòngzhāi* refers to the *Dà Dòngzhāi Fǎ*—the Great Cavern Ritual. The *xiánjìng* is likely a metaphor for the *Tàihé* or *Tàihé* Ritual texts, which the clerk now possesses in full as the *shàngpǐn qījuàn* (Seven Volumes of the Supreme Grade).）\n\nI believe my writing is finished.\nLet me polish it further.\nBy autumn and winter,\nI shall again reveal the *sūtra*.\n（Unknown which *sūtra* this refers to. Next year, the clerk will depart into seclusion.）\n\nHence, I do not take the *shíxùn* (Stone-and-Rice).\nWhen spring grass grows,\nthis matter is easy to find.\nI imagine often wandering at the *xiánshuǐ* (Mystic Waters).\nThis month, I must go.\nSpeak of our brief reunion.\n（The *Nánzhú* [Southern Incense] is not carved in winter,\nbut its flavor and hue are finest in spring.\nSince it is called *shíxùn*,\nit must be the clerk’s method of combining stone and rice.\nAs recorded: “The next dose is a meal of rice,\nwith grains unobstructed—\njust one prescription for a thousand years of life.\nThe method differs, that’s all.”\nThus, I still don’t know where the *xiánshuǐ* is.）\n\nI also do not trouble the *Lǐ* (Lee) family.\nThe *Lǐ* are ill and cannot attend to matters.\nI’ve already burdened *Yì* (Yi) with labor.\nThe *shàngshū* (Secretary) has ordered me—\nif it’s like this, there will surely be an autumnal gathering.\nThis is truly trifling—\nnot worth your slightest concern.\nBut the *Gěishì* (Palace Attendant) says:\nUpon returning to *Nánzhōu* (Southern Prefecture),\nI must also hasten.\nBy mid-April,\nI wish to reach *Dōngshān* (Eastern Mountain).\nI hope there will be no mistake.\n\n（The clerk later notes:\n*\"Chá yī bù\"* (Tea, one scroll)—\nthough the meaning isn’t clear, it’s likely a gift for the clerk.\n*Chá* here refers to *míngchá* (green tea),\nwhich the clerk needs for his *dàn yǐn* (dietary regimen of abstinence),\nand also to aid in light sleep.）\n\nA day without seeing you,\nI constantly fear my vulgar and stingy heart has already arisen.\nCould you still emerge from the dust of *fēngchén* (worldly affairs)\nwith such carefree ease?\n\n（The following eight entries are from *Yángshū* (Yang’s Records),\nall concerning the Master’s return to the mountains and the clerk’s affairs.\nThe original paper is lost—\nthese are letters between teacher and disciple,\nclearly framed as Master and servant,\nwritten in ancient style.）\n\nI follow the *Gěishì*’s manner and spirit as before,\nyet he is still so deferential.\nIn my haste to leave the *shìchéng* (Palace Secretariat),\nI tremble with anxiety.\nBurning incense and entering stillness,\nI compose a nocturnal petition to lay bare my concerns,\nso that the full *dànkǔ* (Elixir of Great Bitterness) may be revealed—\nits principles distinct in motion and repose.\nI await further inquiry.\n（This is a brief note,\nlikely written from the county.\nIt concerns the illness of the *Hǔyǎ Dàoshì* (Tiger’s Claw Commandant).）\n\nThe *Gěishì*’s letters before and after,\nI present to the *Shénmǔ* (Divine Mother).\nThrough them, I address the *xiǎoyuàn* (Junior Clerk).\nI also submit my replies to the *Shénmǔ* before and after.\nThe *xiǎoyuàn* intercepted the *Gěishì*’s letters,\nleaving only this one to be returned.\n（This also pertains to the *Hǔyǎ*—\nevents after the clerk’s departure.\nThe *Shénmǔ* is likely *Nánzhēn Fùrén* (Southern True Lady).\nThe following are Yang’s external letters and his own recorded dreams,\nalong with his replies to the Commandant and other clerks,\nas well as preserved notes.\nThere are also separate records of exchanges with the *Zhēnrén* (True Person),\nalready mentioned in earlier volumes.）\n\nThe *Dàoshì*’s letter states:\n*\"In the year of *Yǒu* (the Ox), I studied.\nIn the year of *Xū* (the Dog), I shall return.\nIn the year of *Xū*, the Dao will traverse the world.\nIt says that from the year of *Xū*, I shall receive the law.\"*\n（This entry is from the clerk’s later records.\nHe notes that in the year *gēngwǔ* (Regnal Year *Gēngwǔ*),\nhe departed—\nthis *Xū* (Dog) refers to the years *guǐyǒu* (Year of the Ox) and *jiǎxū* (Year of the Dog),\nwhen he received the *fǎ* (law)—\nthat is, the *Dàoshì*’s teachings on the *sūtra*’s two *bèn* (leaps/phases),\nand his attainment of *Zhēn* (Perfection) in the eleventh year.\nThus, the records say:\n*\"After sixteen years, I shall see you at *Dōnghuá* (Eastern Flower).\"*）\n\nThe *sūtra* says:\n*\"The Master of all *guān* (passages) begins with the *jìng* (Mirror) of clarity.\"*\n\n（This is from the *Huángtíng Jīng*—the Yellow Court Classic.）\n\nThe dates are as follows:\nSeptember 17th—190 days passed.\nOctober 21st—200 days passed.\nOctober 26th, November 1st, 8th, 11th, 15th, 17th, 20th, 23rd, 30th.\nNovember 2nd, 6th.\n（This

**one chi two cùn (yīchǐèrcùn)** in height,\nstretching **nine chi six cùn (jiǔchǐliùcùn)** in length,\nand **six chi five cùn (liùchǐwǔcùn)** in width.\nMats are arranged according to the **seasons and months**,\nturning with the **lunar phases (yuèjiàn)**.\nThe **walls are plastered thick—one chi (yīchǐ)**—\nand smoothed meticulously.\nThis method suits **remote mountains, great marshes, or uninhabited wilds**,\nunfitting for human dwellings.\n\nUpon entering the chamber,\n**each of the four seasons has its own method**.\nYet this is but **inherited from the Dao/Way’s tradition**—\na single affair of the **Daoist school**,\nnothing extraordinary.\n\n**Essentially, it is known thus:**\n*\"This, and so forth—*\n*(The Daoist **static chamber method (jìngshìfǎ)** differs.\nPerhaps it was passed down separately,\nyet without careful verification.\nNow, when visualizing entry into the chamber,\none may follow it as well.\nSome say there should be a **sutra** as well.)\"*\n\nOn the **fifteenth day of the first month**,\nwhile **on duty in the Secretariat (Shàngshūshěng)**,\nI prayed for dreams of extraordinary **numen (língxiān zhēnxìang)**—\nmany revealed blessings for my descendants.\nOn the **second day of the intercalary month at dusk**,\nI again dreamed of **celestial assemblies (xiānlíng gònghuì)**,\nand begged for auspicious responses.\nI also saw **(a missing character) of extraordinary splendor**.\nAt the **midpoint of the month**,\nsuddenly, I encountered **Nine Elders (Jiǔlǎo xiānsheng)**,\nwho summoned me in **chariots (chēzhào)** and led me along.\nWe met with joy, and they said:\n*\"We have been in Xuānchéng for forty days and shall return.\"*\nThey inquired after my affairs and said:\n*\"We shall reach Wúhú by the twenty-third day,\nthen return to visit you.\nWe shall be delighted to see you again.\"*\n*(This was when I was **Magistrate of Yùyáo**,\nlater serving as **Secretary of the Secretariat**.)*\n\nOn the **fourth day of the intercalary month at dusk**,\nI dreamed of **colorful banners (cǎiwù)** in the shape of **flags (yángxíng)**,\nall spread out upon the mats—\nsome like **paintings (huà)**, some like **embroidered brocade (jǐnxiù)**,\ntheir **characters bright and radiant (wénzì huànbǐng)**,\nas if **speaking yet unspeakable**.\nThe more they unfolded, the more wondrous they became.\nThey said it was **Yang’s household treasures (Yángshè wùwù)**.\nYet I did not see **Master Yang** at the time.\nThey urged me to **record them**,\nsaying: *\"Only one skilled in **ordering figures (zhěngdùn)**—\nsomething I have never seen—\nshould undertake this.\nThere will be about ten such banners.\"*\n\nOn the **fourth day of the intercalary tenth month of the [Great] Yonghe era**—\nwhen **Master Yang** was twenty-three years old,\nand **Emperor Xiànwén** had just become **Grand Tutor**,\nthough he had not yet been **Secretary of the Secretariat**—\n*(perhaps this was the following year’s intercalary month as well)*\n\nOn the **twelfth day of the eleventh month**,\nI dreamed of a **coffin and funeral implements** exposed with water.\n\nOn the **eighteenth day of the twelfth month**,\nI dreamed of piercing **Xuánwǔ with an iron hairpin**.\n*(This Xuánwǔ was likely the **Xuánwǔ of the tomb**—\nnot the tortoise and serpent I had kept.)*\n\nOn the **twenty-first day**,\nI dreamed of seeing the **Son of Heaven**,\nwho appeared to be about sixteen or seventeen years old,\nstanding upon the **hall’s platform**.\n*(This must have been during the reign of Emperor Kāng—\nthough I do not know which year.)*\n\nAgain, I dreamed of being in the same place,\nwhere a **hanging mountain chest** released itself,\nfalling from a **precarious peak**.\nFrom afar, I saw **Liú Shēng** conversing with someone.\nFrom that point, I was to **return home**—\nbut the **road back was perilous**.\nI obtained a **fine knot** and threaded it through a **handkerchief**.\nI saw my **native city** offering support,\nand thus I was able to **turn and retreat**.\n*(The above six entries are all recorded by the Prefect himself from his dreams.)*\n\nOn the **ninth day of the tenth month**,\nthe **five officials of the kitchen** were ordered to **hunt in the southern mountains**.\n*(This is also recorded by the Prefect himself—\nwhere \"ordered\" should be read as **\"pointed out\"**.)\n\nThe decree pointed to the **oath of thunder** to pacify the residence and purify the dwelling.\n\n**Yá** visited the **lady** (the empress).\nThe decree should use **double gold rings**.\nYou have none.\nI shall prepare **exchange gifts** to repay the favor.\nIf **Hòu** has a **golden thread**, present it to the lady.\nSay it is to repay the **officials and soldiers**.\nWhen **Huá Gōngcāo** arrived,\nhe secretly whispered to the **newly wed** (omitting \"newly wed\" in the original),\n*\"Keep it secret, keep it secret!\"*\nIf not, then present **two double gold rings** with a kneeling offering.\nDo not hesitate, do not hesitate.\nIf you wish to obtain the treasures from the **imperial person’s** adornments, that would be best.\n*(Huá Gōngcāo seems to be Huá Jiào.\nLater, it mentions \"Yang’s decree,\" which may be incorrect.\nHòu appears to be the **Tiger-Tooth Lady**.)*\n\nRecently, I wrote to you in detail about the two **decrees** that should be issued.\nThat very night, there was an imperial edict stating:\n*\"We two officials and soldiers—\nif the decree is not carried out,\nour descendants will no longer serve as messengers.\"*\n\nWithin **Yang’s decree**, it states that a **hairpin** may be used.\nThe **younger lady** said that the hairpin is used to **guide and open pathways**—\nit can certainly be used.\nThe newly wed has a **gold hairpin**,\nwhich can be used as a substitute.\nIt can be stopped and threaded.\nFirst, present it to the lady.\nThen, present it to the **two spirits**.\nYou measure it accordingly.\nYou shall seek a **bell-shaped ornament** as per the earlier decree.\n\nThe newly wed may also use a **silver hairpin**.\n\nIf there is none,\nthen the **bell-shaped ornament** should be used.\nI have stopped your letter awaiting the **decree**.\nThe **decree** should follow beneath it.\nDo not make another separate one.\n\n(This book touches upon prior matters.)\nTo obtain a **favorable and tranquil** state,\nit says: *\"We command you to study the **Inner Canon**.*\nThis is **preservation of life**.\nYou respond indifferently, **without reply**—\nthis is not proper.\nYet these are not ordinary teachings;\nthey all arise from **mysterious profundity**.\nYou should compose them as **root and branch**.\nYour response should follow this intent.\nIf you speak nothing aloud,\nit is **unacceptable**.\n(The **Inner Canon** perhaps refers to the *Huangting Jing*—\nor else it should be the **natural laws** within the nuptial chamber.)\n\nTao Xiu gave you **two hundred sheets**—\nI retain **one hundred**.\n(Checking the *Tao* register,\nthe **Chief Clerk’s wife’s** relatives\ndo not appear with the name *Xiu*.)\n\nThe **white rice** for the **axe** has already been prepared.\nYou shall **provide it**.\n(This is for **dyeing** to make it **blue** {*to eat* **Zhen**}.)\n\n*Yi* warned: *\"You should be slightly less than perfect.*\n**Guard against this**.\"\n(*Yi* is **Changing the Chief Clerk’s wife**—\nthese seven items\nare all from the **Chief Clerk’s and the Tiger-Tooth Lady’s** book.)\n\nRight, the **Chief Clerk** Xu in his lifetime copied and recorded matters from the *Memoirs of Affairs* and dreams.\nAll that which was also recorded in the books given to his sons is concluded here.\nAs for what was recorded in the *True Spirit Canon*,\nit has already been separately listed in the earlier volumes.\nThe **Master** himself entrusted his spirit,\ncasting his form into the **Eastern Grove of Shadows**.\nHe bathed in the **Leisurely Hill**,\nyet strayed from my shared heart.\nEach time he gazed east toward the **Azure Sea**,\nhe sighed at the swift passage of time.\nWhen he turned west toward the **Cloudy Peaks**,\nhis sorrow welled from within.\nHe longed for his homeland,\nbut its barriers loomed ever higher.\nHe intended to return his body to the **Muddy Path**,\nyet only twisted his feet and stilled his ears.\n\nThen, with a tranquil mind and single thought,\nhe leaned upon the **Spirit’s Void**,\nascending rugged cliffs.\nHe raised his head to behold the **Mysterious**,\nsealing his consciousness behind the **Threshold of Darkness**.\nHe wandered among the clouds,\nand his **True Form** stood erect—\nonly then did he realize his body was not his own.\nThus, he abandoned his **corporeal shell** and returned to his **spirit**,\nhis heart free as the **wild winds**,\nhis path through the world forever severed.\nHe found joy in the **secluded groves**,\nand all external hardships were blocked away.\nWith unwavering resolve,\nhis **sincere essence** was never wasted.\nHe then encountered a **brilliant teacher**,\nreceived **marvelous techniques**,\nand heard **pure lectures** of profound mysteries.\nHis **jade voice** revealed **cavernous secrets**.\nThrough **breath regulation**, his countenance became serene,\nhis **soul refined** and his **bones preserved**.\nHis **qi** surged and was smoothed away—\nno longer was there any distinction between inner and outer.\n(This is the method of **elixir ingestion** taught by Wang Shilong and others.)\n\nYet I regret that I met my **good teacher** too late.\nMy **nature** was hindered, and my **progress** was not early.\nThe **difficulties** of attaining the **Dao**,\nthe **arduous trials**—\nthese were already recorded by **True Lord** Dinglu,\nand I have set them down as well.\nThe **venerable** and the **reliant**,\nthe **covering** and the **rescuing**—\ntheir **virtue/power** cannot be altered by heaven and earth.\n(It should read *yú* instead of *yù*. This is the **ordeal** spoken of by Dinglu.)\n\nI hear that my younger brother has journeyed far to attain the **upper laws**,\n(referring to the **Dao of Supreme Clarity**)\nencountering the **True** and the **profound**,\n(meaning the **Cloud Forest Descent**)\nhis mind observing the **Spirit’s Origin**,\n(referring to the **Xie Method**)\nand **refining the Five Spirits**.\nHe ascended the **Seven Gates’ towering grandeur**,\n(meaning the **Flying Heaven** technique)\nand savored the **Three Celestial Bodies** to accumulate **transformation**.\n(referring to the **Sun, Moon, and Five Stars**)\nHis **spirit** fell void beyond the **clouds**,\nand his **essence** lingered in the **Nine Abysses**.\nThis **Dao** is lofty,\n(its **advancement** is sublime).\nNot something my disciples could ever hope to hear.\nIt is also because my **foundation** is shallow,\nand I have not yet reached it.\n\nBut those who pursue the **highest practices** must always beware of **peril**.\nThose who find **delight** in the **Dao** often risk losing it.\nThe **clarity** of **fortune and misfortune** is applied here.\nThe **Dao** is close to those who **strive diligently**,\nand the **spirit** returns to those who **cultivate sincerity**.\nA **red heart** awaits the **True**—\nif one harbors **a hundred distractions**,\nnarrowing one’s focus on the **Dao**,\neven if one exerts oneself for a **hundred years**,\nthere will still be no hope.\n\nThe **Three Officials** face **urgent trials**—\nI have spoken of this before.\n(In the **heavy discourse** on dispelling and overcoming **ordeals**)\nThis was already explained to you earlier.\n\nThe **Seven Tests’ blessings** have been spread to posterity.\n(As for **your brother’s merits**,\nthey will extend to the **Chief Clerk’s father and son**.)\nThe **fate’s course** is swift—\nhow could it not be?\nNearly completed yet ruined,\nself-made and self-destroyed—\nall these **thousand trials** arise from **evil influences**.\n\nThink of the **good**—\nhow much **bitter effort** and **labor** to refine one’s **form**,\nto **cultivate merits**—\nyet all things drift like clouds.\nWhat use is it?\n\nThe axe’s *shuāoshuāo*—\nhow enviable its fate!\nEach fails to awaken—\nyet must meet this trial.\nWho but the axe alone\nenjoys such lofty heights?\n*(Sighing at its singular transcendence)*\n\nThe bonds of master and friend—\ngain and loss, the objects of reverence—\nleaning on shadows to seek the true,\nall rests in this act.\n\nI now dwell in spirit’s mountain retreat,\nshading my form in deep forests,\nplucking the reclusive herbs of the valleys,\n*(handcrafting)* the elixir grasses to attain the true.\n*(Lofty words of attainment—\nsomewhat exaggerated for effect.)*\n\nEarlier, when the Dao was perfected, I would return to deceive trust.\nThough not yet fully illuminated,\nroughly resembling the likeness,\nI also wished to rest in the hollow wilds,\nvisiting ancestral mounds.\nUnplanned, I went—\nhoping to see my younger brother once more.\nCircumstances were brief,\nand as I wrote, my longing deepened.\n*(From my ancestor’s given name, Yìng,\nI changed it to Yuǎnyóu—\nthis ten-character inscription honors my brother.)*\n\n*(Note: The following entry—\nAfter the Master faced the trials,\nhe served as Chief Clerk.\nAt that time, he was already in Gàizhú Mountain.\nThe record states:\nIn the Year of the Dragon, he would temporarily return to deceive the people’s trust.\nThus, this must be the correspondence from the years of the 3rd Heavenly Stem—Bing-Yin or Ding-Mao.)*\n\nServing as a minor official in the first year of the **Taihe** era (827 CE), I wore the **Six Jia Talismans** *(a method of the Lingfēi Six Jia School—\nseparate scriptures exist for this.)*\nIn the second year of **Taihe** (828 CE).\n\nThe **Yearly Star** was in **Ding-Mao**.\nIn the first month, I practiced the **Returning to the Origin Dao** *(this is the Method of Atonement; there is a separate scripture for it)*.\n\nIn the second month of **Taihe** (828 CE),\nI performed the **Empty Constant** *(this is a distinct Flying Step method)*.\n\nIn the fourth month,\nI wore the **Green Fang** *(this is the Green Fang’s nascent method; the world has yet to see its scripture)*.\n\nIn the seventh month,\nI practiced the **Sun and Moon in the Heart Mud Pill Dao** *(the following five entries were recorded together on one sheet of paper)*.\n\nPreserving the **Sun and Moon in the Mud Pill method**—\nin the sixth month of **Taihe** (828 CE), I performed it *(previously noted as the seventh month; there must be an error in the characters—this is the method of wearing the Sun and Moon Fang)*.\n\nIn the fifth month of **Taihe** (829 CE),\nI performed the **Dashing Between Two Scenes Dao** *(this is the method of the *Yùlín* School; though there are copies, no grand scripture has been seen. Again, the following two entries were inscribed separately on another sheet of paper in red ink, not connected to the previous records)*.\n\nOn the third night of the second month... *(two characters lost).*\n\nIt seems to be called **\"Dreaming of Lady Zheng Bai\"**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of exchange has those who are intimate within yet distant without.\nZheng’s modest concerns—\nthis is precisely the case now.\nI should come together with **Mountain-Zeng’s** aunt.\n\n*(Zheng refers to the mother of Dengyi’s wife.\nShe consorted with Lady Yiqian, hence the dream of the clerk to forge a bond across the misty ford.\n**Mountain-Zeng’s** aunt remains unclear—\nthe exchange in dreams should also be in the second month of the second year.)*\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day of the fourth month, at midnight,\nI dreamed of a woman\nwearing upper and lower layers of green silk robes.\nShe met with me and introduced herself, saying,\n*\"I am the younger sister of Wang Mi-Shou.\"*\n\nWhen we met,\nit seemed as though we were in a mountain forest.\nShe said, *\"Tomorrow, I may briefly step out beyond the West Gate.\nThe oxcart with a white cow and a leather headwrap for the driver is mine.\"*\n\nLater, we parted and met again at **Gui Jie**.\nShe spoke and composed a poem as if bidding farewell:\n*\"Crossing the **Shuilu** ford,\nGathering herbs atop the central peak.\nUnveiling the heart’s luminous thoughts,\nEthereal and boundless—no words to grasp.\nI wish to wander with one of noble virtue.\nWith matched steeds, we ride the threads of fate.\nWhat use are the dusty honors?\nSwiftly, I urge you toward pure clarity.\nIf you can seize the subtle vision,\nInhaling and exhaling will prolong life.\"*\n\n*(Wang Mi-Shou’s younger sister—\nthe **Zhonghou Lady**.\nSince the clerk has not yet encountered her in truth,\nhe uses the dream to convey his meaning.\nYet the line about \"dusty honors\" suggests\nshe may not be the clerk’s intended.)*\n\nOn the fifth day of the sixth moon in the first year of **Taihe**,\nI suddenly heard celestial **golden bells and drumming** from above.\nThen, looking upward, I saw **rainbow-like** **colorful clouds**,\ntheir **qi** form bright and refreshing—\nspreading across the sky, moving straight from east to west.\nIn my mind, I thought it was the **female spirit** passing by.\nSome called her **Yuanjun**.\nSuddenly, she appeared as if walking along a road,\nand in a flash—**as if a spark**—she had gone.\n\nThe **jade ax** then chased after the **clerk**,\nbut only saw a **palace carriage**,\nfollowed by a **red-robed attendant**.\nAll returned to pay respects.\nBeside the road stood one man,\nin white robes like a **fortune-teller**.\nHe spoke, saying:\n*\"Your body is frail and cannot endure toil.\nYou should focus solely on your **Dao/Way**.\nDo not mix in other matters.\nIf you do not focus, you will fall ill.\nYou do not yet believe—\nbut you will surely dream of this.\nThis man claims his surname is **Zhuó**.\"*\n\nToward the end of the seventh moon,\nthe **jade ax** dreamed of his body soaring upward,\nand with a sudden clarity—**as if a great opening**—\nit entered beneath a house.\nStacked beds faced south, and he sat there,\nsaying: *\"I am the **harmonizing light of the sun**,\nthe **Dao/Way** that reverses the five stars’ course.\"*\n*(These words come from the **Sutras for Dispelling Illusions**,\nthe speech of the **Highest Sovereign**.)*\n\nA man stood facing east, extending his hand to unroll a scroll.\nThe images revealed were like painted landscapes—\nmountains and valleys in vivid detail.\nBelow the scroll were written words,\nand he conversed with the man holding the scroll for quite some time.\n\nOn the third evening of the eighth month,\nhe dreamed suddenly of a man in tattered robes,\ntall and gaunt—\nfollowing a small boy, as if **hustling wares** *(a peddler’s cry, meaning like one calling out to sell things)*.\nHe sat and spoke with the Jade Ax.\nThen he spoke of **Highest Dao/Way** matters.\nThe Ax was startled, sat upright in alarm.\nAfter a moment, as he was about to enter the inner gate,\nhe expounded on the **Highest Dao/Way**.\nHe looked back at the small boy:\n*\"Do not let anyone see me outside the drum.\"*\n\nThe Ax asked, *\"Is it the **Celestial Hook Music**?*\n*(referring to the lofty melodies of the **Upper Pure** realm)*\nThe man replied, *\"No.\nI have come only to take what can be taken.\nYou yourself will surely obtain the **Celestial Hook Music**.\"*\n\nThe Ax then asked how many were needed for the **Celestial Hook**.\nThe answer came:\n*\"Ten for one **Celestial Hook**.\nThe Great Law extends even to ten thousand.\"*\n\n*(He did not know it reached as high as a hundred thousand.)*\nThen he awoke again, drifting back into sleep.\nOnce more he dreamed of a scroll—\nthe Jade Ax’s book first unfurled,\nbut only the later sections revealed **Lord Wang’s** affairs,\nlike the **Four Ministers’ Transmission**.\nAll were gathered above,\ndiscussing Lord Wang’s years of **Dao/Way** study—\nthe visions and dialogues of his **Dao/Way** practice.\n*\"It will take two or three years,\"*\nhe thought, with great reverence.\n\nThis man had not yet paid his respects\nwhen he awoke.\nAt last, he saw the **Chief Clerk** also seated among them.\n\nOn the thirtieth night of the eighth month, **Taihe** Year 1,\nhe dreamed of receiving a scroll with four small volumes.\nIt was said to be the **Divine Mother’s** book,\nor perhaps a **Transmission**.\nAll were bound with fine blue silk,\nwith red ends.\nThe pages were blank.\n\nAt the time, the **Master** was also present.\nHe then inscribed the **Jade Ax’s Transmission**—its preface—\nupon a white wall outside the door,\nits characters resembling **talismans**,\nor like beastly forms.\nThe scroll’s wrapping did not resemble ordinary silk.\n*(Recorded with care.)*\n*(The Master refers to **Lord Yang**.)*\n\nOn the twenty-fifth night of the third month, **Taihe** Year 3,\nthe Jade Ax dreamed he was walking in the heavens.\nWhite clouds swirled and coiled,\nlow-hanging yet not high.\nGazing upward through the clouds,\nhe saw an empty space\nshaped like a mountain cave.\nMoving eastward several steps,\nhe perceived a great **Dao/Way** to the northeast.\nFollowing it, he entered a deep chamber—\nlike a stone hall.\nA radiance emerged from within,\nor perhaps a surging watery mist,\ncrowning the Jade Ax’s body.\nHe sat up abruptly,\nyet felt no fear.\n\nThe mist then suddenly dispersed.\nWithin the chamber, a bed and mat were seen—\nits utensils and furnishings most orderly.\nIn his mind, he deemed it the dwelling of a **numinous being**.\nHe bowed and kowtowed before the chamber,\nthen begged and entreated.\nInside, there was a hole.\nThe Jade Ax advanced further through it,\nbut the passage was narrow and constricted—\nhe could not proceed.\nYet in his resolve to advance,\nsuddenly he saw a man outside the chamber,\nwho spoke to the Jade Ax: *\"You must not enter yet.\nYou shall soon reach the front.\"*\nHe bowed again, saluted, and withdrew.\nThen he was seen escorted to the Dao/Way,\nurged to receive the scriptures.\nHis words were earnest and meticulous:\n*\"You must diligently preserve this.\"*\nThe **Southern True Lady** dispatched three attendants\nto guide the Jade Ax across the **Board Bridge**.\nAt first, he emerged\nand saw within an ox-cart two youthful figures,\ntheir heads exposed,\nlaughing and conversing with the man.\nBefore reaching his dwelling,\nhe awoke—\ndelighted, yearning for enlightenment,\nas if the dream had conveyed a message.\n*(Recorded with care.)*\n*(The following seven entries are all self-recorded dream accounts.\nAt that time, my humble thoughts—\nwhat difference did they make from today’s recluse?)*\n\nThe **8th day of the 3rd month**, the Jade Ax presented a memorial.\n\nThe Jade Ax spoke:\n*\"The Zheng [family] has returned. By imperial command,\nYour Reverence still suffers from lingering drink-induced pain.\nI dare not approach—my body trembles in reverence.\nI pray Your Reverence’s meals are now without ailment.\nThis very day, I have received Your favor.\nThe tooth [i.e., the tooth-ache] has reached this point—\nI wish to depart westward and arrive early.\nRespectfully, I submit this memorial.\nThe Jade Ax bows twice.\"*\n\nThe Jade Ax spoke:\n*\"Your Reverence seeks the *Liujia* talisman.\nIt seems to be at the *Yá* [official’s] residence in Jùróng.\nThe Ax has not yet received word from the mountain.\nI pray to examine it from the *Yá*’s collection.\nRespectfully submitted.\n*(This *Liujia* talisman is not a *Língfēi* [divine flight] talisman—\nit must be in the *Yòuxuán Lù* [Left Mysterious Register].)\"*\n\nThe Jade Ax spoke:\n*\"I received the *Liúbēi* gathering three days ago.\nYour Reverence also composed poetry.\nI trust the letter will soon be returned.\nRespectfully submitted.\nThe salt tea arrives soon.\nI pray for a gift of betel nut—I must consume it daily.\nRespectfully submitted.\n*(One must always have tea and betel nut—\nthis is also to dispel phlegm and dampness.\nThus it is said one may bathe frequently,\nto wash away the illness when free from labor.\nThis letter’s weight and size differ slightly.\nIn this age, calling one’s father ‘Your Reverence’ is proper—\nancient rites were often thus.)\"*\n\nThe Fourteenth Day of the Fourth Month, respectfully submitted:\nThe Jade Ax spoke:\n*\"The heat is gradually increasing.\nI do not know how Your Reverence’s body fares—whether at rest or in motion.\nI pray for a gift of **gradual-awakening tea** to dispel it.\nFar from home, I tremble with fear—\nI urgently request permission to depart.\nThis very day, I have received Your Reverence’s favor.\nRespectfully submitted with the letter.\nThe Jade Ax bows twice.\nThe Jade Ax spoke:\n‘I have **betel nut**. I pray for a gift of it.\nFor now, I temporarily borrow Xu Shen’s services to escort me until my return.\nRespectfully submitted.’*\n\nThe Fifteenth Day of the Fourth Month, respectfully submitted:\nThe Jade Ax spoke:\n*\"Yesterday, Xu Shen promised to escort me immediately.\nThe heat is gradually increasing.\nI do not know whether Your Reverence’s body is now at ease or otherwise.\nI pray for a gift of **gradual-awakening tea** to dispel it.\nFar from home, I tremble with longing.\nThe **Yá** remains as usual.\nAt the appointed time, I was granted permission to depart.\nThe Jade Ax has crudely received Your Reverence’s favor.\nRespectfully submitted with Feng Ling’s letter.\nThe Jade Ax bows twice.\n*(Xu is the elder brother of the **Shù**.)\"*\n\nThe Eighteenth Day of the Fourth Month, respectfully submitted:\nThe Jade Ax spoke:\n*\"The heat is oppressive and stifling.\nI do not know how Your Reverence’s body fares—whether at rest or in motion.\nI pray for a gift of

pray for safe travels.\nLittle Hist is within the hall.\nTo prevent him from venturing far,\nor being delayed by the floods.\nRespectfully submitted with Chen Hui’s letter.\nThe Jade Ax bows twice.\n*(This is also the **Míngzhēn** Retreat**—**\nonly to keep outsiders from being delayed by the floods.\nLittle Hist is likely his name,\nyet he still sends the young attendant inside to serve.\nThe noble cannot personally attend to such trivial matters.)\"*\n\nThe Jade Ax spoke:\n*\"Xu and the **Yá** have also been granted temporary permission to return here.\nI pray for safe travel.\nRespectfully submitted.\"*\n\nApril 23rd, the day of the bowing memorial:\nThe Jade Ax speaks: *\"By imperial command, I arrived last night.\nThe heat and chill have been soothed.\nMay Your

arrived.\nRespectfully submitted with the memorial.\nThe Jade Ax bows twice.\"*\n\nThe Jade Ax speaks: *\"Yang’s younger brother, the official’s sibling, lies gravely ill.\nI am deeply concerned.\nI trust his recovery will soon be favorable.\nRespectfully submitted.\"\n(Previously, Yang’s letter spoke of his aged mother;\nnow it speaks of his brother—\nonly these two matters are made clear.\nThe

its sixteen volumes, twelve are the True Person’s decrees,\nand four are worldly records.)\n\nIn reverence, I trace the Dao scriptures—\nthe *Upper Clarity* of the highest grade,\nattaining the utmost true immortality.\nThe *Lotus Sutra* of the Buddha’s wondrous law,\ncomprehending the singular vehicle.\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s Inner Chapters of the Immortal’s writings,\nfathoming the realm of boundless mystery.\n\nThese three Dao suffice to encompass all phenomena,\nembodying both the subtle and manifest,\neach comprising twenty volumes.\n\nAt this time, the *Yù Xuán Fāng* and *Yù Jǐ*—the seven celestial officials—\nwere aligned to harmonize the eight directions.\n\nThe *Hidden Residence’s* method for ascending to true transcendence,\nalso structured in seven precepts.\n\nNow, in recounting this *True Announcement*,\nit again forms seven days—\nthe five-sevens tally,\nand all cosmic principles are complete.\n\nThe True Person’s intent\ndiffers from worldly conventions.\nWith reverence, I follow the *Fǎnwéi* and *Hòu*—\nselecting their thematic correspondences,\nand framing them in triplets—\njust as the *Zhuangzi* does,\nfor it reflects the subtle teachings of the *Chángsāng* Master.\n\nCommon scholars, observing this, fail to grasp its purpose.\n\nThe *True Announcement* is the True Person’s own decree—\nas if the Buddhist scriptures all state, *\"Thus did the Buddha speak.\"*\nYet *Gù Xuánpíng* mistakenly termed it *\"true traces.\"*\nIt should be called the True Person’s handwritten decrees,\nor the True Person’s recorded deeds.\n\nIf taken as handwritten, the True Person could not have written in clerical script.\nIf taken as recorded deeds, then these traces do not belong to the True Person.\nMoreover, at the time of their inscription, the True Person had not yet attained transcendence.\nSince this contradicts their essence, it is unfit as a designation.\n\nThe *Southern Peak Lady’s Transmission* records the *Qīng* [*bamboo slips*] text:\n*\"In the year *Jiǎzǐ*, on the first day of the month, the hour *Xīnhài*.\"*\n\nThe *Xian Nong* feast began at dawn.\nIn the year *Jiǎyín*, *Yǔshuǐ* [羽水]—the *Yǔ* [羽] being rain—\narose with the *An* [安] and the *Qǐ* [启] of the year.\nThe transmission then commenced.\n\nThe child of the *Dao*-attained one\nshould practice the *Yùwén* [玉文] script.\nCarefully tracing the *Jìn* [晋] calendar,\nthe *Aìdì* [哀帝] *Xīngníng* [兴宁] year of the *Tàisuì* [太岁] *Jiǎzǐ* [甲子],\nthe first day of the month, *Xīnhài* [辛亥] at the new moon.\n(Though the auspicious date could be used to honor *Xian Nong*)\nOn the fourth day, *Jiǎyín* [甲寅], *Yǔshuǐ* [羽水] descended.\n(Within the first month, *Yǔ* [羽] means rain.)\n\n*Qǐ* [起] is *Xīng* [兴], *An* [安] is *Níng* [宁].\nThus, the name is veiled in ambiguity.\nTherefore, by the *Xīngníng* [兴宁] year’s first month,\nthe *Nán Zhēn* [南真] had already descended and granted the *Yáng Jūn* [杨君] the scriptures.\n\nNow, examining the records of the *Zhēnshòu* [真授],\nthe earliest year and month are:\nthe *Yǐchǒu* [乙丑] year, sixth month, twenty-first day,\nwhen the *Dìnglù* [定录] was granted the inquiry.\nFrom this month and day onward,\nthere were gradual descents and transmissions.\n\nFurthermore, the *Zhōngshǐ* [中侍] *Fūrén* [夫人] revealed:\n*\"Let the bamboo slips be planted beside the northern lodgings,\nto bring forth successors.\"*\nShe also said:\n*\"The *Fúhé* [福和] will bear two sons,\nwith great virtue destined to rule the world.\"*\n\nThis was during the time when *Jiǎnwén* [简文] was the *Xiàngwáng* [相王],\nand due to his lack of sons, he made the request.\nThus, *Lǐ Fūrén* [李夫人] bore the *Xiàowǔ* [孝武] and the *Guìjì Wáng* [会稽王].\n\nWhen *Xiàowǔ* [孝武] passed away at age thirty-five,\nit was in the *Rénxū* [壬戌] year,\ntwo years before *Jiǎzǐ* [甲子].\nThus, the *Zhēnshòu* [众真] had long been descending upon *Yáng Jūn* [杨君].\n\nAgain, in the *Yǐchǒu* [乙丑] year, sixth month,\nthe *Dìnglù* [定录] likened the scriptures to *Yáng Jūn* [杨君],\nsaying: *\"I once obtained the writings of the previous year,\nthe eighth day of the third month.\"*\nThis should also be the *Guǐhài Jiǎzǐ* [癸亥甲子] year.\n\nMoreover, *Yìng Lǜ* [愕绿华] descended in the *Shēngpíng* [升平] year,\nwhich was the *Jīwǔ* [己未] year,\nfive years before *Jiǎzǐ* [甲子].\nThough this descent was not for *Yáng Jūn* [杨君],\n*Yáng Jūn* [杨君] knew of it and recorded it.\n\nIn the *Yǐchǒu* [乙丑] year,\nthe *Ān Fēi* [安妃] told *Yáng Jūn* [杨君]:\n*\"In twenty-two years,\na worthy ruler will ascend to the clouds and ride the dragon.\nThe *Shàngqīng* [上清] of the Northern Court\nshould be marked by the *Tàiyuán* [太元] year, *Dīngxū* [丙戌].\"*\n\nThus, over twenty years of recorded transmissions,\nmany matters were not fully accounted for.\nWhat remains today is but a few years.\nUpon examining the beginning and end,\nnot a single detail is omitted.\n\nBefore the *Zhēnshòu* [众真] descended upon *Yáng Jūn* [杨君],\nthey had already commanded *Huá Jiào* [华侨] to transmit the *Yīnyì* [音意].\n*Huá Jiào* [华侨] having been slandered and dismissed,\nthe *Zhēnshòu* [真] thus ordered *Yáng Jūn* [杨君] to take charge.\n*Huá Jiào*’s [华侨] writings and traces did not emerge in his time.\n\nThough *Èr Xū* [二许] were of noble bearing and refined talent,\ntheir nature was incompatible with the *Shìjì* [世迹].\nThus, they did not attain the *Zhēnshòu* [真授].\nMost of what was transmitted\nwas established for *Èr Xū* [二许],\nall decreed by *Yáng Jūn* [杨君].\nThe *Shū* [疏] were shown to *Èr Xū* [二许].\nOnly the *Ān Fēi*’s [安妃] few records were *Yáng Jūn*’s [杨君] own.\n\nNow, when people see the titles:\n*\"On such a day, such a month, such a lord [口受] granted to *Èr Xū* [二许] and *Yòu Yǐng* [右掾]...\"*\nThey claim it was *Èr Xū* [二许] who personally received the *Yīnyì* [音旨].\nThis is far from the truth.\n\nThe books written by *Èr Xū* [二许]\nare all copies of what *Yáng Jūn* [杨君] instructed them.\n\nMoreover, *Yòu Yǐng* [右掾] recorded:\n*\"In the *Tàihé* [泰和] year, I practiced the *Dào* [道].\nThe two *Lù* [录] were received in the second year.\nAfter the third year,\nthere were no further *Shū* [疏].\"*\n\nThe *Zhōngshǐ*’s [中侍] calligraphy was not skilled,\nand his transcriptions were few.\nToday, one matter may have two or three versions,\nall being *Èr Xū*’s [二许] repeated copies,\nwith no discrepancies.\nYet *Yáng Jūn*’s [杨君] writings all lack duplicates,\nclearly indicating that only *Yòu Yǐng*’s [右掾] records were preserved.\n*Yáng Jūn*’s [杨君] own records have vanished beyond measure.\n\nAfter *Yáng Jūn* [杨君] departed, six or seven years passed,\nbut no traces of the *Zhōngshǐ* [长史] emerged.\n\nRegarding the recorded years and months today,\nthe *Yǐchǒu* [乙丑] year has the most entries,\nwhile the *Dǐngyín* [丙寅] and *Dīngwǔ* [丁卯] years each have several.\nThe first volume still retains some semblance of order,\nbut the remaining volumes have dates and events jumbled,\nnot fully aligned in sequence.\n\nAs for the recorded dates of transmissions,\nmost do not specify the year.\nI have now arranged them sequentially,\nassuming their order based on precedence.\nSome matters are interrupted,\nbut not all must be accounted for.\nWhen no year or month is recorded,\nor when the recipient is not specified,\nthey are left as originally omitted.\n\nThe *Zhēnshòu* [真授]’s teachings on others’ likes and dislikes\nwere all inquiries made by the *Zhōngshǐ* [长史] on behalf of *Yáng Jūn* [杨君],\nand the answers were given accordingly.\nThey were kept secret within *Èr Xū*’s [二许] circle,\nand at that time, not all were necessarily aware.\n\nMoreover, *Bìng Jǐn* [并衿] received the *Jǐngyáng Ān* [景阳安],\nwhich was clearly and distinctly explained.\nAll the poems of *Xīng* [兴] with or without waiting,\nas well as the *Cí* [辞], *Yù* [喻], *Fěng* [讽], and *Zhǐ* [旨],\nwere all descended by *Yúnlín* [云林] upon the *Pínxiān Hòu* [嫔仙侯].\nTheir meaning and purpose were also manifest.\nThe *Nán Zhēn* [南真] was the teacher who instructed,\nwhile *Zǐwēi* [紫微] was the artisan of the lower teachings.\nThey were not bound by the *Liǔjié* [俦结] rules.\nHowever, *Zhōnghòu Zhāolíng* [中侯昭灵] seemed to have a separate domain.\nSince the matters were not all from one time,\nthe records are not entirely precise.\n\nThe other male *Zhēn* [真]\neither accompanied or were assigned by those cited,\nsuch as the two *Jūn* [君].\nThey were the primary leaders.\nIf people read these transmissions\nwithout understanding this principle,\nthey will never grasp their true meaning.\nHence, I briefly mark the general intent,\nwhich should be kept in strict confidence.\n\n*Èr Xū* [二许] should have been practicing the scriptural arts.\nSince they did not attain the *Zhēnshòu* [真授],\nthey had no way to see the scriptures.\nThus, the *Nán Zhēn* [南真] first instructed *Yáng Jūn* [杨君],\nthen ordered him to transmit.\nThe transmission then became the teacher.\nThat is why the *Zhōngshǐ* [长史] and *Yòu Yǐng* [右英] wrote:\n*\"The *Nán Zhēn* [南真] in pity,\nlast spring sent the teacher to instruct in the *Dòngfáng* [洞房].\"*\nYet *Èr Xū* [二许] were separated by worldly conventions\nand did not revere or respect the teachings.\n\nYang dared not presume to act on his own.\nHaving violated the true precepts,\nhe declared:\n*\"To receive the scriptures is to have a teacher—\nshould I then be ashamed of this?\"*\n\nYet the *Nán Zhēn* [南真] was the *Xuán Zhōng* [玄中] teacher.\nThus, Yang and the *Zhǎngshǐ* [长史] alike called her the *Xuánshī* [玄师].\nIt was further stated:\n*\"The afflicted should first inform the *Xuánshī* [玄师].\nOtherwise, their condition will not improve.\"*\n\nYet the letters from the *Zhǎngshǐ*, *Yòu Yǐng* [右英], and the assembled *Zhēn* [真]\nmerely expressed their trembling reverence—\nthis was but the form of a teacher’s manner,\nnot the true transmission itself.\n\nMoreover, in Yang’s writings, there are many drafts marked with *\"[人巉]\"*—\nthese were all written during the reception of instructions.\nSince they were hastily composed and later revised,\nhe would recall earlier words and then add or subtract accordingly.\nFor those who wrote carefully and neatly,\nhe would rewrite them entirely\nto present to the *Zhǎngshǐ*.\n\nNow, regarding the three *Jūn* [君]’s handwritten letters—\nsince their originals are no longer extant,\nthe texts have been indiscriminately copied without distinction.\nThus, each entry is annotated below.\nIf a letter’s authenticity as a true original is uncertain,\nit is marked *\"[某书]\"* [so-and-so’s letter].\nThere are also four or five letters from different hands—\nit is unclear whether they were written simultaneously by scribes\nor later additions by others.\nSince no names are attached and their authenticity cannot be verified,\nthey are all transcribed here,\nwith annotations distinguishing them as *\"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" \"D\"* for verification.\n\nFurthermore, within the texts, there are variations in handwriting—\nadditions, deletions, and corrections marked *\"[人巉]\"*—\nmost of which were made by *Èr Xǔ* [二许] and his descendants.\nSome were to invoke auspicious names,\nothers to align with contemporary conventions,\nbut they were all baseless fabrications.\nYet they were unable to discern this,\nand thus uncritically adopted them.\nSince these are not originals,\nthere is fear of further confusion—\neach alteration is therefore annotated.\nIf a text was personally revised by the original author,\nno further distinction is made.\n\nAs for the handwriting of the three *Jūn* [君],\nYang *Jūn*’s script was the most refined—\nneither too modern nor too archaic,\ncapable of both bold and delicate strokes.\n\nUpon closer examination, though the three *Jūn* [君] imitated the *Xi* [希] *Yì* [邑] [法] script,\ntheir strokes adhered to strict proportions,\nyet their names were not renowned—\nlikely due to their humble origins,\nand also being overshadowed by the two *Wáng* [王].\n*Yáng Jūn*’s [杨君] calligraphy was a study of *Yáng*’s [掾],\nwith sharp and vigorous strokes,\nparticularly skilled at copying *sūtras* [经] and drawing *fú* [符].\nIt bore resemblance to *Yáng*’s [杨],\nyet its bold and dynamic brushwork\nwas beyond human skill alone.\n*Yù Bó* [郁勃] excelled in *zhāngcǎo* [章草] script,\nbut his *zhèngshū* [正书] was awkward and crude,\nand his *fú* [符] lacked finesse—\nthus he never copied *sūtras*.\nIn the past, *Yǐn Jū* [隐居] once observed *Zhāng Dào’ēn* [张道恩]’s ability to distinguish authentic script,\nadmiring his divine insight.\nNow, upon seeing the three *Jūn*’s [君] works,\none could recognize their styles\nby even a single stroke—\na revelation beyond mere skill.\nIt was as if Heaven granted this discernment,\nallowing one to perceive their true nature.\n\nAgain, the three *Jūn*’s [君] calligraphic styles\ndiffered from those of the present age.\nThey followed conventions of exaggerated elegance—\nwriting *guī* [龟] as *lóng* [龙], *xū* [虚] as *huá* [华],\ndisplaying ornate attire (*xiànfú* [显服]),\nand omitting the closing stroke (*yǐqián* [阙关]).\nAll three adhered to these norms.\nAs for *Yáng Fēi* [杨飞] (also *Yáng Wǒ* [掾飞]),\n*Yáng Wǒ* [杨我] (also *Yáng Wǒ* [掾我]),\n*Yáng Líng* [杨灵] (also *Yáng Líng* [长史灵], *Yáng Líng* [掾灵]),\n*Yáng Zhēn* [杨真] (also *Yáng Zhēn* [长史真]),\nand *Yáng Shī* [杨师] (also *Yáng Shī* [掾师]),\n*Yáng È* [杨恶] (also *Yáng È* [长史恶]),\nthese were their self-imposed variations.\n\nMoreover, they wrote *guǐmó* [鬼魔] as *mó* [摩],\n*jìngjié* [净洁] as *shèngjié* [盛洁],\nand *shèngzhù* [盛贮] as *qǐngzhù* [请贮].\nSuch deviations were broadly consistent—\nthough not all can be exhaustively recorded,\nfearing later generations,\nin transcribing these works,\nwould inevitably alter them to suit contemporary styles.\nThus, their examples are marked here,\nso that successors may adhere to them diligently.\n\nThese discrepancies and similarities\nare all thoroughly documented in *Dēngzhēn Yǐnjué* [登真隐诀].\n\nFurthermore, among the three *Jūn*’s [君] scripts,\nsome characters were not properly formed—\nby principle, they should be simplified (*yìng zhì yì* [应治易]),\nyet their original traces must be preserved intact.\nAlterations should not be made arbitrarily—\ncareless changes would only lead to confusion,\nlosing the authentic essence.\nThus, all suspect characters are now encircled in red (*jūguō* [朱郭]),\nwith annotations beneath them.\n\nAdditionally, the three *Jūn* [君] frequently wrote on *Jīngzhōu* [荆州] white paper,\nwhich, over time and exposure,\nsometimes became frayed or damaged at the edges.\n\nSometimes the paper would rot or tear away,\nleaving fragments lost to time.\nEarlier hands, unable to fully reconstruct the missing parts,\nhad merely patched them together.\nNow, I have taken the original characters,\ndiscarding the damaged sections entirely.\nWhere the text was lost—no longer the authentic hand—\neven if later scribes filled in the gaps,\nthe original intent must be preserved.\nThus, I have recorded them as they are,\nwithout further dissection.\n\nAmong the three *Jūn*’s works, some scrolls survive intact—\nonly those copied by the two *Xǔ* under Dao transmission.\n(*The \"Dūgōng Jì\" is attributed to Yang Jí and his clerk’s hand,*\n*and these too remain whole in form and content.*\n*The rest—whether five sheets, three sheets,*\n*or even a single scrap—*\n*were later patched together by others,*\n*not arranged in their original order.*\nNow, I have extracted (*bá* [拔])\nthe dated entries and those of similar themes,\nno longer following the sequence of the earlier scrolls.)\n\nAs for the collected sayings of the *Zhēn* masters,\neach bears profound meaning—\nsome in verse, some in admonition,\ninterwoven in dialogue.\nYet their compiled manuscripts,\nwhen categorized by topic,\nlose their original coherence,\nmaking their intent obscure.\nNow, I have restored them to their original context,\ngrouping them by date, paper, and ink,\nto preserve their natural flow.\n\nRegarding the rituals of *Qǐjū Bǎoshén* and the *Míngtáng* dream-prayers,\nthe ten-odd recorded methods\nare mostly copied from scriptures,\nlacking proper beginnings or endings—\nlike the *Rìmáng* (日芒), *Rìxiàng* (日象), *Xuánbái* (玄白), or *Fúwù* (服雾) rites.\nYet they were never properly compiled,\nleading to their neglect and loss.\n\nNow I have compiled and annotated them all,\neach according to its proper form.\n\nAs for those texts whose original manuscripts remain unseen,\nand whose transmission—whether extant or lost—cannot be verified,\nI dare not hastily omit or discard the inconsistencies and discrepancies recorded therein.\nInstead, I have annotated my doubts in each case,\nlisting them under their respective entries.\n\nRegarding the recorded lineages of the *Dònggōng* (洞宫) and the immortal clans of the various mountains,\nI intended to cross-reference them with external texts for detailed annotation,\ntracing their origins and lineages.\nYet fearing that such exposition might reveal their essence too plainly,\ncontrary to the hidden Dao,\nI have only marked the discrepancies and ambiguities.\n\nAs for the *Gōngguǐ Guān* (宫鬼官),\ntheir accounts may be disclosed as circumstances warrant.\n\nNow, concerning the origins of this book,\nthe accounts of divine descents take precedence,\nfollowed by the subsequent records of events.\nThe descent of the divine occurred at *Jiǔhuá*,\nyet the compilation concludes with these matters last.\nMoreover, the deeds of the Master were not yet at the level of the divine,\nand thus should not be included in this section.\nYet the records of *Wáng Yòujūn* (王右军) and his descendants were mistakenly included,\ncontrary to proper order.\nNow, I have placed the *Ānjì* (安记) first,\nremoved the *Xǔ Chuán* (许传),\nand added them to the external texts under the category of immortals.\nOnly the letter the Master wrote to his younger brother after attaining immortality\nremains in the later volumes.\n\nThe *Chángshǐ* (长史) letter pertains to the *Huáyáng* (华阳) affair,\nwhile the *Huáyáng* affair is in response to the *Chángshǐ* letter.\nForcing them into two separate sections disrupts their natural sequence.\nNow, I have restored them to their original order.\n\nAs for the recorded years of the two *Xǔ* (许),\nthey were inconsistent and erratic.\nI have now carefully cross-checked them with the divine revelations,\nand annotated the discrepancies in names,\nappending them after this volume.\n\nRegarding the writings of the Three Masters,\nsome were not directly received from the divine,\nsome were copies of secular texts,\nsome were personal dream records,\nand some were private letters—\nnone of which should be mixed into the *Zhēn Gào* (真诰) canon.\nYet, as these texts are precious in ink and brushwork,\nI have compiled them together as the sixty-first volume.\n\nThere remain a few additional entries,\nwhich I have also included according to the same standard.\n\nWithin the *Zhēn Gào*,\nall texts written in purple ink with large characters\nwere secretly transcribed by the recluse from the Three Masters’ handwritten copies,\ninterspersed with miscellaneous events,\neach cross-referenced and categorized for verification.\nSince these scriptures are not casually accessible,\ntheir separation in the original examples would obscure their study.\nNow, they are compiled together here for easier examination.\n\nAmong these six texts, those written in red ink with small characters\nare all annotations by the recluse,\nserving as supplementary notes.\nThe black-ink small characters remain the original text.\n\nThe beginning and end of the *Zhēn Jīng* (真经) trace its origin to the *Shàngqīng* divine scriptures,\nwhich first emerged in the *Jìn* dynasty during the *Āiníng* era (哀帝兴宁二年),\nwhen the *Tàisuì* (太岁) year was *Jiǎzǐ* (甲子).\nThe *Zǐxū Yuánjūn* (紫虚元君), the *Shàngzhēn Sīmìng* (上真司命),\nand *Nányuè Wèi Furen* (南岳魏夫人) descended,\ninstructing their disciple, the *Lángyè* (琅琊) *Wáng Sītú* (王司徒),\nthe palace attendant *Yáng* (杨某),\nto transcribe in clerical script and pass it to the military protector *Jùróng Xǔ* (句容许某),\nalong with the third son, the *Shàngjì Yuàn* (上计掾) *Xǔ* (许某).\nThe two *Xǔ* further transcribed and refined them,\npracticing Dao and attaining transcendence.\nThe handwritten texts of the Three Masters that survive today\ninclude over ten large and small scriptural transmissions,\nmostly copied by the *Yuàn* (掾),\nand over forty volumes of divine revelations,\nmostly written by *Yáng* (杨).\n(The *Lángyè Wáng* (琅琊王) was the *Jiǎnwén Dì* (简文帝) when he served as Crown Prince in the Eastern Palace.)\n\nThe *Chángshǐ Yuàn* (长史掾) established his residence at the rear of *Xiǎomáo* (小茅),\nwest-north of *Léipíng Shān* (雷平山).\nThere, he transcribed and refined the texts for practice.\nHe ascended in seclusion during the *Tàihé* era (泰和五年).\n\nThe *Chángshǐ* departed again in the first year of the *Tàiyuán* era (泰元元年).\nHis son, *Huáng Mín*, then seventeen years old,\ncollected and preserved the transcribed scriptures and secret bamboo records over the years.\nAt that time, several volumes had also scattered among relatives and acquaintances—\nthese are the ones now held by *Jùróng*.\nIn the third year of *Yuánxīng* (元兴三年),\nas turmoil raged in the capital region,\n*Huáng Mín* carried the scriptures inward\n*(the Chángshǐ’s father had once served as a county magistrate,\nrenowned for his virtue and benevolence;\nthe Chángshǐ’s eldest brother also resided there,\nhence his refuge there)*,\nand was supported by *Dōngchǎn Mǎ Lǎng*’s household\n*(Lǎng was also called Wēngōng)*.\nLǎng’s junior cousin, *Hǎn*, assisted in their sustenance.\nThe people all recognized *Xǔ* the Master’s attainment of the Dao,\nand his grandfather’s reputation as well,\nso they honored him with filial reverence.\n*Duàodǐ* *Dù Dàojū* of *Qián’táng*\n*(the father of the *Shísì Jīngchǎn* resident)*\nwas wealthy and of noble standing,\nand frequently invited them.\nAt that time, none of the others yet knew how to seek or examine the scriptures’ teachings—\nthey merely received and revered them.\nBy the *Yìxǐ* era (义熙中),\n*Kǒng Mò* of *Lǔguó*, a devout adherent of Daoist teachings,\nserved as *Jìnan* Prefect.\nAfter his dismissal, he returned to *Qián’táng*.\n\nHearing of *Xǔ Láng*—his ancestors having attained the Dao,\ntheir scriptures preserved in full—\nhe went to visit *Xǔ*.\nBut *Xǔ* refused to meet him.\n\n*Kǒng* knelt in obeisance, bowing repeatedly,\nremaining for a span of ten moons,\noffering gifts with earnest devotion,\nhis sincerity profound.\nAt last, *Xǔ* yielded and taught him.\n\n*Kǒng* then ordered *Jìn’ān* Prefectural clerk *Wáng Xīng* to copy the texts.\n(*Xīng* was diligent and skilled in calligraphy,\nso the task was entrusted to him.)\nWhen *Kǒng* returned to the capital,\nhe treasured only the records,\nnever practicing them himself.\n\nDuring the *Yuánjiā* era, he was again appointed Governor of *Guǎngzhōu*.\nAfter his death, his son *Xuī* passed away first.\n*Xuī* was quick-witted and learned,\nsecretly perusing the texts.\nHe found the *Dà Dòng Zhēn Jīng* stating:\n*\"If recited ten thousand times,\none may attain immortality.\"*\nHe scoffed at this, declaring it absurd,\nasserting that Daoist transcendence required elixirs and alchemical refinement of the form—\nhow could mere chanting yield feathered robes?\n\nMoreover, other Daoists joined in disparaging the method,\nsome advising against keeping such texts.\nThus, in a moment of haste, they were burned away,\nleaving no trace behind.\n(*This was likely a hidden intent to prevent their spread in the world.*)\n(*Later, Xuī [Guāng] and others were executed alongside Fàn Yè in a conspiracy.*)\n\n*Wáng Xīng*, who had copied them for *Kǒng*,\nprivately made another set,\nlater intending to return east to study.\n\nAfter crossing the Zhejiang River,\nhe was soon caught in a storm and drifted adrift,\nonly preserving a single copy of the *Huángtíng* text.\nWang Xing then chastised himself severely\nand remained in the mountains,\ngradually devoting himself to reading and recitation.\nThe mountain spirits burned his dwelling in flames.\nAgain, while studying on an open platform,\na sudden downpour ruined his scrolls and ink,\nso he could not complete his repetitions.\nDeeply aware of his transgression,\nhe severed all human ties,\nrecording only dates in his book\nand trading grain to sustain himself.\nHis son, Dao Tai, served as a Jin’an maritime supervisor,\nwealthy and generous,\noften visiting to offer gifts\nand sending two slaves in attendance.\nYet Xing accepted nothing\nand remained steadfast in the mountains.\n\nThus, the two copies written by Kong and Wang\nwere all destroyed—\nnever circulating in the world.\n(*This was likely due to Xing’s unauthorized copying and use,\nleading to such consequences.*)\n\nThere was also Wang Lingqi,\na man of brilliant intellect and refined talent,\nwhose ambition was to propagate the Dao.\nSeeing Ge Chaofu construct the *Língbǎo* framework,\nwith its teachings spreading widely,\nhe grew deeply resentful and envious.\n\nThus, Wang Lingqi went to Xu Cheng to request the transmission of the *Shangjing*.\nXu Cheng refused him.\n\nWang endured frost, dew, and snow,\nnearly risking his life.\n\nMoved by his sincerity, Xu Cheng finally granted it.\nUpon receiving the scripture, Wang rejoiced and returned to study it deeply.\nHe realized the sacred law could not be openly propagated,\nand the essential teachings could not be fully revealed.\n\nThus, he secretly added and altered passages,\nembellishing them with elaborate rhetoric.\nFollowing the titles of the Wang and Wei traditions,\nhe expanded and fabricated new works\nto complete his collection.\n\nHe further exaggerated their authenticity,\nelevating the Dao’s prestige.\nIn total, he produced over fifty additional texts.\nThose eager to compete heard of his vast knowledge\nand flocked to revere and learn from him.\nAs his transmissions spread widely,\nbranches and offshoots proliferated,\nnew and old versions became confused,\nmaking them difficult to distinguish.\n\nUnless one had seen the original scripture,\nit was impossible to verify or discern the truth.\n(*Some of his annotated copies still survive today.*)\n\nJú Shīsheng, the monk Biāo, and Gōng Bǒyù—\nmen of refined talent—\nhave said:\n*\"The world contains many men of brilliance and eloquence.\"*\n\nThus, he severed ties with all others.\nI and King Lingqi set sail together from the capital.\nBy the time we reached the Dùnpò Gāng [Tonpogang],\nI had already composed two volumes of the Upper Scripture—\ntruly astonishing!\n\nEven before King Lingqi’s time,\nthe Upper Scripture had already been repeatedly corrupted.\nYang Xǐ of Hóngnóng, in the year *Gēngzǐ* of the fourth year of *Lóng’ān* (Hè),\nreencountered me in hiding at Hǎilíng.\nAmong the twenty-odd chapters of the Upper Scripture—\nsome spanning several volumes—were not genuine.\nHe claimed that since his search for the scriptures,\ntwelve years had passed.\nBut this was after Yang Jun departed,\nwhen I began my own work.\nThus, within the *Língbǎo* Scripture,\nI incorporated what I had composed—\nnot all of it was created by King Lingqi alone,\nbut much of it was my own creation.\n\nNow, throughout the world, this is what is transmitted and spread.\nIn the capital and the several prefectures of Jiangdong,\nthere is scarcely anyone who does not possess it.\nYet in the southern regions, it is still not widespread.\n(*This must be because the Dao’s true subtlety cannot be openly proclaimed,\nso it was arranged for King Lingqi to disseminate it in this manner.*)\n\nSince King Lingqi monopolized these novel teachings,\nthe world revered and followed him.\nThus, he falsely claimed that the transmission came from the True One.\n\nThe original text was not the true one.\nThe *Língbǎo* Scripture’s volumes—though lost and scattered—\nwere seen in abundance by Xu Guang.\nHis faith was deep and his wealth plentiful,\nhis disciples numerous and prosperous.\nGold and silk filled his halls—\nyet no one could fathom why.\n\nThen he closed his own books,\nand instead sought copies from King Lingqi.\nThus, the traces of both were spread together,\ntheir voices in harmony, mutually praising.\nSo it came to pass that Xu Guang and King Lingqi\ntraveled in tandem—\ntrue and false, their paths intertwined.\nFollowing the current, they rode the wind,\nand people came from a thousand *li* to seek them.\n\nLater, there was a man named Cai Mai,\nwho also received these ten-odd volumes from Xu,\nsome of which were genuine.\nHe copied and transmitted them widely,\nbut their traces are no longer preserved.\n(*Cai Mai practiced the Dao with sincerity,\nyet the scriptures did not spread widely.*)\n\nWhen Ma Lang saw the *Língbǎo* Scripture transmitted by Xu,\nthe number of volumes had increased.\nHe wished to receive them again,\nand prepared offerings with deep faith,\nplanning to depart on a set day.\nSuddenly, he dreamed of a jade basin descending from heaven,\nshattering upon striking the earth.\nAwakening, he pondered:\n*\"This scripture must be a heavenly treasure—\nonce on earth, it can no longer be used.\"*\n\nThus, he ceased his pursuit.\n(*Though Ma Lang did not study diligently,\nhis reverence was profound.\nHis dream was extraordinary,\nand his interpretation was wise—\nhe was surely a Daoist adept.*)\n\nIn the sixth year of *Yuánjiā*,\nXu Cheng wished to relocate to Jiāngtáng.\nHe sealed the original *Língbǎo* Scripture in a chest,\nand entrusted it to Ma Lang’s purified chamber,\ntelling him:\n*\"This scripture bears the traces of the ancient sages.\nOnly I may retrieve it myself.\nEven if letters arrive, do not give it to anyone.\"*\n\nHe then took with him the transmitted scriptures\nand miscellaneous books—\nten-odd volumes in all—\nand traveled to Dùjiā.\nHe stayed there for several months,\nfalling ill.\n\nXu Cheng feared that the request might not be fulfilled.\nHe sent someone to retrieve the scripture,\nbut Ma Lang treasured the books,\nand also adhered to the original instructions.\nHis close kin, having received the imperial edict,\nhow could he dare to hand them over lightly?\nThus, he did not send the reply.\n\nThen, Xu Cheng suddenly passed away.\nThe transmitted scriptures he had carried remained with the Dù family.\nThese are the very scriptures now found throughout the world.\n\nXu Cheng’s eldest son, Róng, returned to their homeland\nto bring back his father’s remains.\nAfter the mourning period was complete,\nhe went to Ma Lang to seek the scriptures.\nMa Lang was skilled in managing affairs,\nbut refused to give him the scriptures.\nXu Cheng, feeling ashamed,\nno longer pressed for their retrieval,\nand stayed on.\n\nLater, Ma Lang taught the *Língbǎo* scriptures\nto be recited and expounded,\nand also wrote out the original texts.\nHe appended notes to each scripture, stating:\n*\"In such-and-such year and month,\nthe Immortal [某真人] transmitted the scriptures to Xu Cheng for his pilgrimage.\"*\n\n(*At that time, most people knew that the Master had ingested elixirs and ascended into the mountains by the Daoist Way,\nbut they did not inquire into the deeds of the Prefect and his son.*)\n\nMa Lang also did not doubt the true meaning of the scriptures.\nAfter several years, Xu Cheng’s son obtained two or three volumes of the original scriptures from Ma Lang,\nand began to disseminate them.\n(*These are the very scriptures that people like Wang Huì and others now possess.*)\n\nIn the twelfth year of *Yuánjiā*.\n\nAfterward, he remained there.\n\nHe was then buried at White Mountain.\n(*His younger brother was still alive, but he indulged in licentious extravagance, taking no interest in scriptural learning. This is why Master He was able to quickly obtain and copy the texts from the Ma family.*)\n\nThe Ma Lang and Ma Han reverently tended to the scriptural treasures.\nWhen they transgressed against their parents,\nthey habitually employed two devoted servants—\n(*one named Whitehead, the other Flathead*)\n—to constantly attend the incense and lamps,\nsweeping and polishing with devotion.\nOften, divine luminosity and sacred qi manifested within their halls.\nLang’s wife was particularly adept at perceiving these wonders,\noften seeing green-robed celestial maidens ascending and descending through the air,\ntheir forms like soaring birds.\nThus, the Ma family grew wealthy and prosperous,\ntheir wealth numbering in the millions.\nWhen they grew old and died,\nLang’s son Hong, Hong’s brother Zhen,\nand Han’s son Zhi and others\nstill continued in their ways.\nIn their later years, they turned to Buddhism,\nand their devotion waned.\n\n(*This was surely the result of the scriptures’ karmic influence manifesting.*)\n\nMaster He Daojing of Shanyin was a man of steadfast resolve from youth,\nskilled in calligraphy and painting.\nHe had once wandered the mountains\nand was taken into service by the Ma family,\nwho entrusted him with all matters of scripture and ritual.\nSeeing the radiant and vivid talismans—\nunlike any worldly texts—\nin the eleventh year of *Yuánjiā*,\nhe began to copy them.\n(*The character \"Mo\" is illegible here.*)\nSince Ma Han resided in another estate,\nHe was also commissioned to compose several additional passages,\nwhich were later combined into two volumes\nand kept in Han’s household.\nLater, He frequently exchanged copies of the original texts,\nreturning to live at his Eastern Villa on Qingtan Mountain.\nThere, he recorded the true events of the scriptures—\na few sheets in total.\nBut He was of coarse and sluggish nature,\nunable to refine his lofty studies.\nLater, most of these texts were lost,\nthough a few volumes remained.\n\nNow, the scriptures are preserved in the household of his female disciple, **Zhang Yujing**, in the **Shihfeng Houfang** estate on **Mountain Zhang** (i.e., *Zhangshan*).\n\n*(Zhang Yujing often used plain white paper for her work. She was coarse and unsophisticated, yet the recluse **Gu Ju** heard of her obtaining the scriptures and thus went to visit her. Upon arrival, he found her returning home from toiling in the fields with a hoe. Gu mistook her for a servant and asked whether the Master **He** was present. She replied that she did not know. Gu then returned to his own home and never saw her again. Gu lingered there for several days, feeling remorseful for his oversight, but ultimately did not seek further contact. People at the time universally regarded He’s vulgar nature and his failure to recognize talent as shameful, lamenting the loss of such an opportunity.)*\n\nAfter He had divided and distributed the scriptures, he also revealed their teachings. **Ma Lang** was enraged and thus cast the bronze keys of the kitchen into molten copper, binding his household servants with an oath never to open them again. In the seventh year of *Dàmíng*, famine struck the **Three Wu regions**, and the county suffered from severe scarcity. **Lou Reshù Huiming**—who had previously been there—returned with his female disciple, **Zhang Yujing**, her attendant **Zhong Yishan**, and several others from the **Yanyuan** region to seek sustenance in this land. Since Lou was skilled in **talismans** and **Five Phases/Elements** (*Wǔxíng*) as well as **hostile destinies** (*sùmìng*), he also interpreted and elucidated their meanings.\n\nMa Hong once again devoted himself to the Dao, entering and exiting the Hall of Serenity with reverence. He witnessed the scripture kitchen firsthand and had already seen what He had recorded. His heart was deeply covetous of the treasures, yet the **golden oranges** (jīnjú) were strictly guarded, and there was no way to examine them thoroughly.\n\nIn the first year of *Jǐnghé*, he left the capital and ordered **Cāijìng Shìjì Zhēn** to open and retrieve the sealed texts from Jiaxing. Cāijìng, however, was reckless and unrestrained. Lou declared that the true scriptures should not be exposed to the world, so he selected and copied the genuine scriptures and genuine transmissions, along with about ten miscellaneous **oral transmissions** (*kǒushòu*), leaving them in Zhong’s care. Only the **unrestricted talismans** (*huòluò fú*) and about twenty small oral transmissions were taken, along with the two records **He** had **not personally inscribed** (*mòshǒu*), to be brought back to the capital. Cāijìng then presented them to Cāijìnghé, who briefly opened them in the **Huálín Garden** before entrusting them to the Daoists of the rear hall.\n\nAt the beginning of the *Qín* [*Tàishǐ*] era, Cāijìng attempted to take out his private annotations. **Lù Xiūjìng** then traveled south, establishing the **Chóngxū Hall**. He also took possession of the texts there. After Lù’s death, they were returned to **Lúshān**. Later, **Xú Shùbiāo** brought them down to the capital. Upon Xú’s death, they remained with Lù’s nephew, **Yùhuái Wén**. (Within these texts were the true transmissions written by the three masters. Later, they were carelessly bound together, divided into twenty-four sections. This occurred in the third year of *Jiànyuán*.)\n\nThe emperor commanded **Dòng Zhòngmín** to construct a **meritorious hall** at **Lúshān**. Dòng sought divine marvels, and **Xú** therefore divided one *Yáng* text into two volumes and gave them to Dòng. Upon returning to the capital, Dòng presented them to **Gāodì**. The emperor entrusted them to **Dài Qìng**, the scholar of the Five Classics. When Dài Qìng departed, he took the texts with him. After Xú’s death, his disciple **Lǐ Guǒzhī** again took one volume and the *Huò* [*Luò*] text away. Only twenty-one volumes remained, all of which were returned to the **Sealed Bright Platform**.\n\n**Lóu Cóng** returned from the capital and settled there, then sought from **Zhōng** the true scriptures left behind. Zhōng refused to return them, so Lóu had them copied. After much time, he obtained several volumes. He bore a grudge against **Mǎ Hóng** and relocated to **Chángshān** in **Dōngyáng**. Later, Mǎ secretly came to take them but mistakenly obtained other scriptures. Meanwhile, some volumes were lost within Lóu’s collection. Still, one or two volumes should remain today. (The second volume was already returned to the Sealed Bright Platform.)\n\n*Zhēn Yuè*, Volume Nineteen.\n*Zhēn Yuè*, Volume Twenty.\n*Yì Zhēn Jiǎn*, Section Two.\n\nDuring the time of **Kǒng Yùcāo** (the humble one), **Dú Jūshì** (the recluse) took the scriptures and settled at **Nánshè Dàhú**.\n\nLóu Cóng initially, together with **Gù Huān**, **Qī Jǐng Xuán**, **Zhū Sēng Biāo**, and several others, jointly examined and assessed the scriptures. Gù had already copied some of the scriptures kept by Lóu, and though he only roughly recognized the true scriptures, they were still selected and sorted. In total, there were four or five volumes of *jīng* and *zhuàn*, and seven or eight *zhēn* (transmitted orally) texts. Some of these still remain in Dú Jūshì’s household. (The two volumes of *jīng* and the *zhēn* (transmitted orally) texts have already been returned to the Sealed Bright Platform.)\n\nIn the late years of the **Sòng Dàmíng** era, **Dài Fǎxīng**, elder brother of **Yán Xīng**, served as county magistrate and was also fond of the Dao. Along with the celestial masters of **Tiānmù Shān** in **Wúxīng**, he also obtained many copies of Dú’s scriptures. Lóu Cóng’s younger brother, **Dào Jì**, and **Fǎ Zhēn**, along with **Zhōng Xīng’s** daughter **Fù Guāng**, all obtained copies of the scriptures from Lóu and Zhōng. Though they exchanged them freely, none could perfectly replicate the originals, yet they often embellished and refined them, making the calligraphy smooth and elegant—utterly devoid of rigid structure or sharp edges. Their copied scriptures were also rife with errors.\n\nBy the year **Gēngwǔ**, the hidden retreat entered the Dao of **Dōngyáng**. Later scholars gradually refined their craft. **Pán Wén Shèng** of **Shānyīn**, **Dú Gāoshì** of **Jiǎngtáng**, **Jiǎng Hóngsù** of **Yìxīng**, and **Xǔ Língzhēn** of **Jùróng** were all skilled in this art. Though people today admire the calligraphy of the \"Two Wangs,\" they fail to recognize the true scriptures. The authenticity of the scriptures stems from the hidden retreat’s hand—there is no need for all to be filled in by **Guō** (i.e., meticulously traced). A single stroke captures the essence, and the power nearly equals the original. As for the seals, regardless of size, they should all be filled in accordingly.\n\nThis ended in the **Qín Tài** era’s fourth year, when the scriptures were moved back to **Shǐníng Shān**. **Mǎ Zhìwǎn**, under pressure from the monks, converted to Buddhism and handed over dozens of Daoist scriptures to Zhōng—all of which **Hé Gōng** had originally written for his father. There were also miscellaneous scriptures by **Wáng Língqī**, but only four or five volumes and six or seven *zhēn* (transmitted orally) texts were in the true handwriting, unrelated to what Lóu had obtained. (The two volumes of scriptures, including the *zhēn* (transmitted orally) texts, have all been returned to the Sealed Bright Platform. After Zhōng’s death, the remaining scriptures should still be with his siblings, his daughter, and **Qī Jǐng Xuán.**)\n\nThe ancient **Chén Léi** of **Dōng Yáng** was a disciple of **Xǔ Zhǎngshǐ**. He was diligent and devout, and **Xǔ Zhǎngshǐ** often entrusted him with the duty of copying and overseeing sacred texts, frequently instructing him in their meaning. **Chén Léi** also transcribed some scriptures himself and obtained **Xǔ Zhǎngshǐ**’s personal copy of the *Bùqǐ Qīyuánxīng* (Seven Elements of the Step Diagram).\n\nAfter **Xǔ Zhǎngshǐ** departed, **Chén Léi** returned to **Dōng Yáng**. In the **Yìxǐ** era’s thirteenth year, he joined forces with two nephews of **Wèi Xīn**, the Prefect of **Dōng Yáng** (from **Rènchéng**), in the alchemical practice of **hédān** (elixir fusion). Upon its completion, the three consumed it in succession, each experiencing extraordinary spiritual effects—ascending to transcendence, embodying transformation, and vanishing into **huàdiàn** (mystic retreat).\n\n**Chén Léi** had a grandson named **[missing name]**, with the sobriquet **Chánglè**. Now residing at **Héngjiāng Qiáo** north of **Yǒngkāng**, he is a **Qīngshān Dàoshì** (Daoist of **Qīngshān**). The **Fán Xiān** (Immortal Fán) also frequently sought out the scriptures **Chén Léi** had transcribed. However, the *Bùqǐ* (Step Diagram) remains in his possession.\n\nWhat is currently practiced is the original version itself. From this point onward, all scriptures found in his collection have their own distinct titles and volumes. If only a few scattered sections or one or two volumes remain, their original titles and chapter listings are now revealed as follows:\n\n**Yángshū Língbǎo** (Scripture of the Soul’s Treasure) with five *fú* (talismans) and one volume—originally held by **Gě Cǎn** in **Jùróng**—from the **[missing year]** of the **Tàishǐ** era.\n\nGě showed these to **Lǔ Xiānsheng**. After Lǔ had expounded the true scriptures—the *Zhēnwén Chìshū*, the *Rénniǎo Wǔfú*, and other teachings—his practice spread widely. Though he no longer wished to display extraordinary miracles, he gave Gě silk offerings in return for the texts, carefully concealing them. When **Gù Gōng** heard of this and earnestly sought to see them, Lǔ refused. He passed them only to **Nányáng Sūn Yóuyuè** and his female disciple **Méi Lìngwén**. After Lǔ’s death, they returned to **Lúshān**. Later, **Xú Shūbiāo** intended to take them out, but he died before doing so, leaving them with **Lǔ Yùhuái Wén** (already returned to **Fēng Zhāotái**).\n\nThe *Yángshū Língbǎo* transmitted by **Wáng Jūn**, one volume—originally held by **Jùróng Gě Yǒngzhēn**—later passed to **Wáng Wénqīng’s** household, then to the **Máoshān Dàoshì Gě Jǐngxiān** (already returned to **Fēng Zhāotái**).\n\nThe *Yànshū Fēibù Jīng*, one volume—originally in the household of **Jùróng Yán [Chóngyǐ]**. In the **Dà Míng** seventh year (1429), during a famine with scarce grain, **Wáng Wénqīng** of his village fed Yán with money in exchange for the text, keeping it thereafter (already returned to **Fēng Zhāotái**).\n\nThe *Yànshū Xīyuè Gōng Jìnshān Fú* and the *Yángshū Zhōnghuáng Zhìhǔbào Fú*—two short volumes—originally obtained by **Shàngyú Wú Zhàbá** from **Xǔ Chéng’s** miscellaneous Daoist texts in a gourd (*Lúguā*). Wú gave these two volumes to **Yīzhě Xiānsheng Bóyù**, who resided in **Nánhè**. While wandering the mountains, he always carried them with him.\n\nThe **Yīzhě** [Xiānsheng] passed away. The texts remained with his disciple **Zhū Sēngbiāo**.\n\nLater, the **Yīzhě’s** fifth brother’s grandson, named **Zhòngyǎn**, again obtained them from **Zhū** (already returned to **Fēng Zhāotái**).\n\n**Wú Zhàbá** of **Shàngyú**, though of the **Jiémǐ** clan, was a man of talent. Initially, he became a Daoist priest. **Xǔ Chéng** gave him a gourd (*Lúguā*) of texts—all minor Daoist techniques and incantations for practical use. Later, he took Buddhist vows and dispersed them all to beggars, exhausting them. Afterwards, he abandoned Buddhism and returned to lay life, dying in obscurity. The texts (*jié*) were never traced thereafter.\n\nThe *Yànshū Tàisù Wǔshén Èrshísìshén Jīng*, along with the *Huíyuán Yǐndào Jīng* (one volume), and the *Bā Sù Yīnyáng Gē* (one volume)—all originally obtained by **Zhāng Língmín** of **Dōngyáng** when he left the capital. At the time, **Zhāng** did not recognize the true scriptures, only saying they were common Daoist texts. He returned to **Dōngyáng** and showed them to **Gù**, but **Gù** did not immediately take to the Dao. He kept them, dividing the *Huíyuán* into two volumes. Later, when **Zhāng** came to recognize them, he sought them out and now holds them. The second volume, the *Jǐng Gē*, **Zhāng** has already given to **Sūn Gōng** (already returned to **Fēng Zhāotái**). **Zhāng** said:\n\nAt that time, there were also several volumes of *Qū Sù Jīnzhēn* (or *Shè Jīnhuá*), now rotted and decayed. Since the true transmission was not yet understood, the scriptures were merely copied by their characters alone, and the original texts were all buried.\n\nAmong the *Yànshū* texts was a short volume of *Lièjì Huángsù Shū*, originally entrusted by Xu Chéng to his disciple Sū Dàohuì. Sū Dàohuì passed it to Shàngyú Hé Fǎrén, who then transmitted it to Zhū Sēngbiāo. Zhū Sēngbiāo offered it to Zhōng Fǎshī. Lóu Jūshì saw it and sought to obtain it—now it should still be in his possession.\n\n*Zhāng* also copied the *Wèi Chuán Zhōnghuángjīng*, along with several sheets of the *Fùzhēn Shòu*. These were once kept by Shānráng Huìlǎng. After Ráng’s death, they should now be with his female disciple or fellow student, *Zhāng Língmín*. In Yǒngxīng, there was a family named Jiě, who in the past also provided offerings to Xu Láng. They also obtained some minor texts. Later, the female Daoist *Fán Miàoluó* of Jīngshān, through connections, acquired the *Yángshū* (a volume on *Gōngshì*). After Fán’s death, it was passed to her female disciple, Shěn Ōu, who then gave it to Kǒng Zǒng of Sìmíngshān. (He has since returned to *Fēng Zhāotái*.) The remaining texts from the Jiě family have now vanished without trace.\n\nIt is also said that in Shānyīn and Qiántáng, several families possess ancient scriptures—likely mixed with genuine texts. From the beginning, they have never been properly investigated. Those who are earnest in learning and devoted to the Dao should diligently seek them out. If any are found, even a glimpse would distinguish the precious from the worthless.\n\n(Additionally, when Wèi Fūrén was in *Xiǎoxī* [or *Xiá*] in Kuàijī, she carried a *zhōngxiāng* [perfumed box] containing ritual robes and scriptures, which she personally offered.)\n\nAfterward, he remained in Shānyīn, where the lineage still exists today. *(Yet it has not yet been properly sought and investigated.)*\n\nThe **True Genealogy of the Descendants** *(This is the account as it stands today, hence it may be called the **True Genealogy**)*. According to careful examination, **Xǔ Chángshǐ**’s sixth-generation ancestor was named Guāng, with the courtesy name Shǎozhāng. He was the fifth son of **Sītú Xǔ Jìng**. During the reign of Emperor Líng, his elder brother Xùn and Xùn’s son Xiàng both sought favor with the eunuchs and prospered in their power. Guāng feared calamity and, in the year **Yōngjiàn** of **Zhōngpíng** (Middle Peace), *i.e.*, the second year of **Zhōngpíng** (184 CE), he crossed the Yangtze River and settled in **Jùróng County**, **Dānyáng**, within **Dūxiāng**’s **Jíyáng Lí**. Later, during the early **Wú** dynasty, he served as **Guānglùxùn**. The tomb of **Xǔ Guānglù** is still there today.\n\nAt that time, his seventh-generation ancestor **Zhào** still resided in **Rǔnán’s Píngyù**. *(Métú Yún states that **Jùróng’s Zǐ’ā** is incorrect.)* The **True Annals** *(or **Zhēn Gāo**) say that **Chángshǐ**’s seventh-generation ancestor **Zhào**, with the courtesy name **Zǐ’ā**, had the merit of **Zhèn Huì** (Reviving Benevolence). However, upon checking the genealogical records, the seventh-generation ancestor’s name was **Jìng**, with the courtesy name **Hóngqīng**. During the **Hòuhàn** (Later Han) reign of Emperor Āndì, he held the post of **Guānglù** (Illustrious Official). In **Yǒngjiàn** (Eternal Construction) Year 1 of Emperor Shùndì, he was appointed **Sītú** (Grand Tutor). His name and courtesy name differ from the **True Annals**; the reason for this discrepancy remains unclear.\n\nIn **Yǒngchū** (Eternal Beginning) Years 2 and 3 of **Āndì**’s reign, there was a great famine. A *dòu* (peck) of rice cost 2,000 *wén* (copper cash), and people resorted to cannibalism. If **Zhào** indeed saved and revived 480 people, as the **True Annals** claim, it must have been during this time.\n\nAccording to the **Hàn** (Han) dynastic **Gūnyí** (Official Rites), as recorded in **Cuī Yùhuàn’s** (Cui Yuhuan’s) memorial, **Xǔ Jìng** was over a hundred years old yet still held his official position. Thus, not only did his **yīndé** (shady virtue) benefit future generations, but his **zìyáng** (self-illuminating merit) also left a lasting mark upon the world. This is why his life was long and free from misfortune, and his position reached the heights of the **táidǐng** (imperial court).\n\nIn **Yǒngchū** (Eternal Beginning) Years 2 and 3 of **Āndì**’s reign, there was a great famine.

The **yìshì** (deliberate succession) of the family was grandly upheld. Thus, they attained the **shénxiān** (immortal/transcendent).\n\n(Shu **Sītú** (司徒) **Xǔ Jìng** (许靖), courtesy name **Wénxiū** (文休), was the eleventh-generation ancestor of the **Chángshǐ** (长史) clan. **Hàn** (Han) **Zhēngshì** (征士) **Xǔ Shào** (许劭), courtesy name **Zǐjiàng** (子将), was the tenth-generation ancestor. **Wú** (吴) **Chéngxiàng** (丞相) **Xǔ Yàn** (许晏), courtesy name **Xiàorán** (孝然), was the ninth-generation ancestor. All three descended from **Guāngwǔ** (光武) Emperor’s **Xǔ Jiāozhōu** (许交州) lineage in the **Hàn** (Han) dynasty. Later, the descendant of the **Jiāoxiàng** (交相) clan bore the name **Shèngqīng** (圣卿). The **Xǔ** (许) lineage originally sprang from **Jiāngshì** (姜氏), a clan of **Yāndì** (炎帝)’s time. During the reign of **Zhōu Wǔwáng** (周武王), **Xǔ Shū** (许叔) was granted the fief of **Xǔ** (许), now known as **Xǔchāng** (许昌) in **Yùzhōu** (豫州). By **Zhōu Jìngwáng**’s (周敬王) fifteenth year, it was destroyed by the **Zhèng** (郑). The family then migrated to **Chāngyī** (昌邑) in **Shānyáng** (山阳). They adopted the state as their surname, and later settled in **Jiāozhōu** (交州), finally moving to **Rǔnán Píngyú** (汝南平舆).\n\n**Xǔ Jìng**’s (许靖) father was named **Fǎng** (方), a **yàn** (attendant) of the **Gōngfǔ** (imperial bureaucracy). **Xǔ Jìng**’s (许靖) fifth son was named **Guāng** (光), courtesy name **Shàozhāng** (少张), who served as **Shàngshū Láng** (尚书郎), **Jùlú Tàishǒu** (巨鹿太守), and **Shàofù Qīng** (少府卿). He crossed the river to the south.)\n\nDuring the early **Wú** (吴) dynasty, he served as **Guānglù Xūn** (光禄勋).\n*(His wife was of the Dài clan; they were interred together in present-day Jùróng’s Ānchéng Lǐ. The tomb was the first of the \"井刀\" [well-shaft] style, and locals still call it the \"Tomb of Xǔ Guānglù.\" The mound and stele remain clearly visible today.)*\n\n**Guāng**’s second son, **Xù Quē** (许阙), courtesy name **Jìyōu** (季优), was a man of talent and learning. He held the post of **Wú Shàngshū Láng** (吴尚书郎) and **Chángshuǐ Jiàowèi** (长水校尉).\n*(His wife was of the Dài clan; they were interred together beside the first tomb.)*\n\n**Quē**’s third son, **Xù Xiū** (许休), courtesy name **Wénliè** (文烈), cultivated the **Dao/Way** in leisure and refined his **qi**. Though offered the post of **zhōu pì biéjià** (州辟别驾), he declined.\n*(His first wife was of the Huá clan from Jìnlíng; his second was a **Gě** of the same county—daughter of the **Shìzhòng Gě Xiàng** (侍中葛相). They were interred together beside the second tomb.)*\n\n**Xiū**’s eldest son, **Xù Shàng** (许尚), courtesy name **Fǔfǔ** (符甫), was a man of talent and renown. In the third year of **Fènghuáng** (凤凰) under **Wú**, he was appointed **Zhōngshū Láng** (中书郎). He died at fifty.\n*(His wife was of the **Táo** clan from the same commandery—the daughter of **Jīngzhōu Shìshǐ Táo Jùn** (荆州刺史陶浚). They were interred together beside the third tomb.)*\n\n**Shàng**’s second son, **Xù Fù** (许副), courtesy name **Zhòngxiān** (仲先), was a **regenerated son** (庶生)—the father of the later **Chángshǐ** (长史). He was gentle, virtuous, and well-regarded by the state and commanderies. He served as **Jìn Yuāndì’s** (晋元帝) **Āndōng Cānjūn** (安东参军), then **Zhēngběi Cānjūn** (征北参军), and held the post of **Tàishǒu** of **Xià Pǔyì** (下丕邑). Later, he was appointed **Níngshuò Jiāngjūn** (宁朔将军) and, alongside **Kǒng Tǎn** (孔坦), campaigned against **Shěn Chōng** (沈充), earning the title **Xīchéng Xiànhòu** (西城县侯). He later served as a magistrate, known for his moral influence.\n\nXù Fù associated with the **Xiè Yì** brothers in scholarly exchanges. When **Sū Jùn’s** rebellion erupted, he again took his kin and fled. After the unrest settled, he was reinstated as **Fèngchē Dūwèi**. He died at seventy-seven.\n\n*(His first wife was **Jìnlíng Huá** of the **Huá** clan, named **Zhuǎn**. She was the younger sister of **Yùshǐ Zhōngchéng Huá Yùqí**. His second wife was **Yìng Lái** of the **Yìng** clan, daughter of **Jìnglíng Tàishǒu Yìng Yànhuī**. Both were interred together in the great tomb to the north of the county.)*\n\nXù Fù had eight sons. The first was **Fèn**, whose given name was **Shǒu**, courtesy name **Xiàofāng**—a **regenerated son**. He possessed both literary and martial talent and was held in esteem. He was adopted by his uncle **Cháo** and served as **Hé Cìdào Cānjūn**. Later, he was falsely accused by his younger brother **Yíwú**, who succeeded him, and was executed by **Kāngdì** at thirty-six.\n\n*(His wife was of the **Wáng** clan. They were interred together in the great tomb to the north of the county. His great-grandson was **Huìzhī**, who rose to the rank of **Sānfǔ**.)*\n\nThe second son, **Huǒzhào**, courtesy name **Xíngmíng**, was a **legitimate son** who inherited the title. He was well-versed in statecraft and possessed the foresight of his age. He also served as **Hé Cìdào Cānjūn**, then as **Nántái Shìyùshǐ**, and later as **Huáilíng Tàishǒu**.\n\nDied at seventy-one. *(His wife was of the **Yóu** clan. Buried separately in Héliú Village, east of the county.)*\n\nThe third son, **Qún**, courtesy name **Tàihé**, was a legitimate son, bright and capable. He served as **Yú Tán Cānjūn**. He died at forty-four. *(His wife was of the **Lìyáng Shào** clan. Buried together in the great tomb to the north of the county.)*\n\nThe fourth son, **Mài**—that is, the aforementioned gentleman—\nThe fifth son, **Mǒu**—that is, the **Chángshǐ**—\nBoth were legitimate sons, recorded separately later.\n\nThe sixth son, **Mǎoxuán**, was a regenerated son, who died young. *(His mother was of the **Chén** clan.)*\n\nThe seventh son, **Shí Huò**, courtesy name **Yìxuán**, with the childhood name **Sìbó**, was a regenerated son. *(His mother was of the **Zhū** clan.)* He was adopted by his paternal uncle **Jié**. He was broad-minded and magnanimous, fond of learning. He served as **Húan Wēn’s Yángzhōu Cóngshì**, then as **Xiè Ān’s Wèijūn Cānjūn**. He accompanied **Xiè Xuán** in campaigning against **Fú Jiān**, earning merit. He was ennobled as **Dūxiāng Hóu**. Later, he held the posts of **Shàngshū Cāngbù Jiàbù Láng**, **Zhèngyuán Láng**, and **Tōngzhí Chángshì**. In his later years, he suffered from windstroke and lost his speech. He died in the second year of **Lóng’ān**, at seventy. *(His wife was of the **Xuānchéng Jǐ** clan. Buried together in the great tomb to the north of the county.)*\n\nThe eighth son, **Língbǎo**, was a regenerated son, who died young. *(His mother was also of the **Chén** clan.)*\n\nHe had four daughters:\nThe eldest, **Jiāng**, was a legitimate daughter, who died young.\nThe second, **Éhuáng**, was a legitimate daughter, who married **Huáng Yǎn**, the **Jiànkāng Lìng** of the same county.\nThe third, **Xiūróng**, was a regenerated daughter. *(Her mother was of the **Zhāng** clan.)*\n\nThe fourth daughter, **Huìróng**, was a legitimate daughter, who married **Jìnlíng Hóngshēng**, the **Āngù Lìng** of the same county. *(She was born alongside **Shí Huò**.)*\n\nThe younger brother, **Cháo**, styled **Yángxiān**, was renowned for his courage and bold **qi** *(as a man of virtue/power)*. He successively served as **Tàishǒu** of **Xiāngyáng**, **Xīnyě**, **Nányáng**, and **Wéngyáng**. Later, he conspired with **Gān Zhuó** to suppress **Wáng Dūn**. When the plot was uncovered, **Zhuó** was executed, and **Cháo** took his own life at the age of fifty-three. *(He was later buried in the great tomb to the north of the county. His wife was **Gě Dí**’s daughter, the sister of **Fèn**. Initially, he adopted **Fèn** as his son, but later had **Yíwú** and **Gāozǐ** by his own wife, both of whom also died young. He left no descendants.)*\n\nThe eldest brother, **Mài**, styled **Shūyuán**, with a childhood name of **Yìng**, cultivated purity and embraced the **Dao**. He lived in seclusion beyond the world. Hence, he later changed his name to **Yuǎnyóu**. He engaged in scholarly exchanges with **Wáng Yòujūn** and his son. When his son **Yóu** was born, he paid homage at **Sānzhī**’s shrine, pressing his hand upon the tablet to receive the **Six Jiǎ** and **Yīnyáng** symbols of the **Dao**. He was born in the year **Gēngshēn** of **Yǒngkāng** (i.e., the first year of **Yǒngkāng**), which corresponds to **Yǒnghé**’s fourth autumn in the **Pǔ** records.\n\n「Retired from the world in the **Xīshān** of **Lín’ān**. At the age of forty-eight—this was the year **Yǒngníng** (i.e., **Xīn yǒu** of **Yǒngníng**), which would make him a year younger. Now, I take his own account as correct. At the time of his seclusion, he was forty-nine years old. He married the daughter of **Sūn Hóng** (字 **Yàndá**), of **Wú Jùn**, who was the granddaughter of **Piāojì Xiù** (i.e., **Mài**). After parting ways, he returned without descendants to his ancestral clan.\n\n**Mài** attained the **Dao**. His deeds are recorded in the second volume, as referenced in the *Yùlù* during the **Shìshì** examinations. His records are already documented.\n\nThe **Chángshǐ** (i.e., **Mù**), styled **Sīxuán**, with another name **Mù**, was born in **Zhèngshēng**. As a child, he was well-known. He was refined and virtuous, embracing the **Dao** with scholarly grace, possessing vast learning and literary talent. The **Jiànwén Diàndà** (i.e., **Emperor Mu of Jin**) long held him in esteem, and he formed many bonds with contemporary sages and scholars. In his youth, he served as **Yùn zhǔng bù** and **Gōngcáo shǐ** of his native district. Though **Wáng Dǎo**, **Cài Mò**, and **Línchuān** sought to appoint him as **Cóngshì**, he declined. Later, he was selected as a **Tàixué Bóshì**, then served as **Yúmiáo Lìng**, **Shàngshū Láng**, **Jùnzhōng Zhèng**, **Hùfū Chángshǐ**, **Jǐshì Zhōng**, and **Sǎnqí Chángshì**. Though outwardly engaged in secular affairs, inwardly he cultivated **Zhēnxué**. He secretly transmitted the **Jiàojì**, adhering to the **Shàng Dào** and distributing what he had received. Thus, he became the **Shàngqīng Zhēnrén**. His rank ascended to **Hòubó**, and his position was listed among the **Qīngshì**. He governed as a **Xiānzhě**, aiding the **Shèngshèng** in their rule, and assisted the **Sages** in guiding the people.\n\nAccording to the **Sīmìng**’s revelation in the year **Dīngmǎo** of **Tàihé** (i.e., **Yǒngxīng**’s second year, **Yǐchòu**), it was said that in the year **Bǐngzǐ**, he would depart. At that time, he was seventy-two years old. This would make his birth year **Yǒngxīng**’s second year, **Yǐchòu**, and his departure in **Tàiyuán**’s first year. However, the records state that he passed away in **Níngkāng** of **Xiàowǔ** (i.e., **Yǒnghé**’s fourth autumn), at the age of seventy-one. This would make his birth year **Guǐhài** of **Tài’ān**, which is two years more. Now, I take the **Zhēnxué** account as correct. (As **Gù** said, in the year **Níngkāng** of **Xiàowǔ**...)»\n\n「Seven-two (i.e., seventy-two). Though he mingled with the common folk in outward affairs, inwardly he cultivated **Zhēnxué** (i.e., **true learning**). His wife was **Táowēi**’s daughter from the same district, named **Kēdòu**. She passed away during the **Xīngníng** era. He then entered the **Yì** (i.e., **Chángshān**) and received instruction in the **Yìguān** (i.e., **Palaces of Transformation**). (They were buried together in the old tomb two *lǐ* northwest of the county.)\n\nHe had three sons and one daughter by **Lǐngshǐ** (i.e., **Count Long**). The eldest son was named **Tiánchuān**, with the diminutive **Kuì**. He was born of a concubine. He served as the district **Gōngcáo** (i.e., **Clerk of the Public Records**). His wife was of the **Liú** clan. The second son was named **Fèngyóu**, who served as the district **Zhǔmù** (i.e., **Chief Clerk**). **Fèngyóu**’s son was **Dàofú**, with the courtesy name **Míngzhī**. **Míngzhī**’s youngest son was **Jìngtài**, with the courtesy name **Yuánbǎo**. He became the **County Magistrate of Hǎipíng**. For long he resided on **Yǔjǐng** Mountain in **Kuàijì**. He diligently followed the family tradition, transmitting the **Scriptures** (i.e., **Daoist texts**) through **Mòshǒu** (i.e., **handwritten copies**), no more.\n\n**Jìngtài**’s wife was of the same district, the **Gě** clan. They had but one son, named **Língzhēn**, born in the year **Wùmǔ**. He still lives in **Kuàijì**. He also reveres the **Dao/Way** and its pursuits, skillfully composing **fúshū** (i.e., **auspicious talismans**).\n\nFrom **Count Long** onward, only this sixth-generation grandson—**Língzhēn**—remains.\n\nThe middle son was named **Lián**, with the courtesy name **Fúhuī**. His diminutive was **Hǔyá**. He was born of a proper wife. He was earnest and trustworthy. He served as both the district **Zhǔmù** and **Gōngcáo**. **Xiè’ān** appointed him as **Hùfūjūn** (i.e., **General Who Guards the Army**), and later as **Gōngcáo**. He was also commissioned as **Magistrate of Yǒngkāng**, **Assistant to the Marshal of the Household**, and **Governor of Jìnkāng**. He did not assume office. He was later named **Fǔguó Sìmǎ** (i.e., **General of the Auxiliary Forces**). In the third year of **Yuánxīng** under Emperor **Āndì**, he died at home, aged sixty-eight. Thus, he was born in the year **Dīngyǒu** of **Xiánkāng**’s third year. (As **Gù** said: *He was born in the third year of Xiánkāng.*)」\n\nHis elder brother **Zǐyōng** (i.e., **Master Righteous**) was also of great error. His wife was the granddaughter of **Huá Yùqí** from **Jìnlíng**. She bore him a son named **Zǐróng**. (They were buried together in **Jiāngchéng**’s **Xīn’ān** village within the **Jiéyuán** boundary.)\n\nHis son, **Zǐchì** (with the courtesy name **Xuánzhēn**), was earnest and sincere, harmonious and reclusive. He served as both the district **Zhǔmù** and **Gōngcáo**. At the age of seventy-four, he died. He had four sons and grandsons, all of whom died early. Thus, there were no descendants left.\n\nThe younger son was named **Suìyǔ**, with the courtesy name **Dàoxiáng**. His diminutive was **Yùfǔ**. He was born of a proper wife. From his youth, he displayed the uprightness of **jī** and **zhāng** (i.e., the virtues of integrity and nobility). The **Zhǔngshǐ** (i.e., **Prefect of a Commandery**) admired his talent, and he was recommended as **Shàngjì Yuàn** (i.e., **Assistant Superintendent of Finance**), **Zhǔmù**, and **Gōngcáo**, though he never took up these offices. He was of refined and luminous bearing, yet he shunned worldly affairs like chaff and husks. Dwelling beneath **Léipíng Shān** (i.e., **Mountain of Tranquility**), he devoted himself diligently to his studies, always wishing to retire early to the **Dòngshì** (i.e., **Hollow Chamber**, a Daoist term for the body after death or the state of transcendence). He did not desire to linger long in the mortal world.\n\nHe then went to **Běidòng** (i.e., **Northern Grotto**) and declared his intent to depart. He resided in the **Fāngyú** mountain grotto and **Fāngyuán Guǎn** (i.e., **Hall of the Square Enclosure**). Often he would travel to the **Sìfāng Píngtái** (i.e., **Four-Square Terrace**), a sacred Daoist site. Hence, **Zhēnshì** (i.e., **True Edict**) said: *\"The recluse, while alive, always took joy in dwelling here.\"* And **Yáng Jūn** wrote in his letter to the **Zhǔngshǐ**: *\"I do not know if the recluse in **Fāngyú Shān** has already set aside a seat for me in a dwelling that is easy to move to.\"* After his death, sixteen years later, in the year **Dīngmǎo** of **Tàihé**, he was promoted to **Shàngqīng Xiān Gōng** (i.e., **High Clarity Daoist Official**) and **Shàngxiàng Dìchén** (i.e., **Supreme Attendant of the Imperial Court**). According to the records, he was thirty years old at the time, though he did not remember the year of his passing.\n\nCross-referencing the two registers, in the year **Dīngmǎo** of **Tàihé** (i.e., **Tàihé’s second year**), he was twenty-seven. Thus, he was born in the year **Xīnmǎo** of **Xiánníng’s seventh year**. (As **Gù** said: *\"He was born in the sixth year of Xiánhé. Again, it is said that the **Sītú** (i.e., **Grand Tutor**) appointed him as **Yuàn**, but this was not true.\"*)\n\nFrom the third year of **Tàihé** onward, there were no further traces of him. According to the records, he died at thirty, which would be the year **Gēngwǔ**. (Again, **Zhēnshì** said: *\"He followed **Zhāng Zhènán** in his nightly ascension.\"*)\n\n---\n*(Note: \"玉奇\" (Yùqí) and \"岁羽\" (Suìyǔ) appear to be names; \"珪璋标挺\" (jī zhāng biāo tǐng) refers to the uprightness of the *jī* and *zhāng* vessels, symbols of virtue in ancient Chinese culture. \"洞室\" (Dòngshì) and \"洞\" (Dòng) are Daoist terms for transcendence or the state after death. \"四平方台\" (Sìfāng Píngtái) is a specific Daoist site, often associated with immortality practices.)*\n\nWhile the method of **Zhāng Zhènán’s** nightly ascension remains unverified, the elders recount that **Yuàn** was found upon the northern stone altar in the **Běidòng**—there he burned incense, paid homage, and lay prostrate without rising. On the following dawn, his form appeared as in life. This altar still stands today, unaltered, proving his early transcendence and withdrawal from mortal affairs. (Further details are recorded in the second volume.)\n\nHis wife was the daughter of **Huáng Yǎn**, the **Jiànkāng** prefect, who was the son of **Gū Xiānghuáng**—her name was **Jìngyí**. She bore **Huáng Mín**, who was then sent back to his family. Later, she separated and remarried to **Dài Qí**, the prefect of **Yuànlíng**, by whom she had a daughter named **Sùxiān** (a concubine’s child). This daughter married **Huá Yīng**, son of the **Yuèqí** cavalry officer from **Jìnlíng**, whose name was **Guǎng**.\n\n**Yuàn’s** son, **Huáng Mín** (courtesy name **Xuánwén**), was born in the fifth year of **Shēngpíng** (a year of the **Xīnyǒu**), when **Yuàn** was twenty-one. He served as a county magistrate’s assistant, was recommended as a **xiàolián** (filial and incorruptible scholar), held the post of **Sīnóng Chéng**, and later became a **Nánmán** military officer and the prefect of **Línzhú**. He died in the sixth year of **Yuánjiā** in the **Sòng** dynasty, at the age of sixty-nine. His wife was the daughter of **Gě Wàn’ān**, the prefect of **Xīyáng** (who was the second grandson of **Bàopǔ Zǐ**). **Huáng Mín’s** eldest son was **Róng** (or **Yùzhī**), who died in the twelfth year of **Yuánjiā**.\n\nThe lineage is unknown in age. There was a daughter named **Dàoyù** (道育). Born in the **Dīngyǒu** (丁酉) year of **Lóng’ān** (隆安) Year One. In the **Jiǎwǔ** (甲午) year of **Xiàojiàn** (孝建) Year One of the **Sòng** (宋) dynasty, she died on **Rén** (任) Mountain (also called **Tǔdì** (土棣) Mountain). *(The world called her the Elder Mistress of Xǔ (许大娘). Her body lay in a stone tomb, unburied, yet often emitted fragrant qi.)*\n\n**Huáng Mín’s** younger son was named **Qìng** (庆). In the **Jiǎwǔ** (己酉) year of **Tàishǐ** (泰始) Year Five of the **Sòng** (宋) dynasty, he also died on **Rén** (任) Mountain (also called **Tǔdì** (土棣) Mountain). Unknown in age, there was a daughter named **Shén’ér** (神儿), also known as **Qiónghuī** (琼辉). Born in the **Jiǎsì** (己巳) year of **Yuánjiā** (元嘉) Year Six, she died in the **Bīngyín** (丙寅) year of **Yǒngmíng** (永明) Year Four of the **Qí** (齐) dynasty. *(The world called her the Younger Mistress of Xǔ (许小娘). Many Daoists in the Eastern Gate recognized her.)*\n\nTo the right, these are the descendants I inherited from the **Chángshǐ** (长史). Now only **Jué Xuán’s** (揆玄) great-grandson **Língzhēn** (灵真) remains.\n\n**Yáng Jūn** (杨君), whose name was **Xī** (羲), was born in the ninth month of the **Gēngyín** (庚寅) year of **Chéng Dì’s** (成帝) **Xiánhé** (咸和) Year Five. Originally, he seemed to be from **Wú** (吴). Later, he settled in **Jùróng** (句容). When **Língzhēn** (灵真) passed away, he still had his mother and younger brother alive. **Yáng Jūn** (杨君) was a man of purity and virtue, with a graceful appearance and pleasant demeanor. He excelled in conversation and laughter, as well as in calligraphy and painting. As a youth, he loved learning and reading books, being well-versed in the classics and histories. His nature was profound and dignified, with a deep and sincere disposition. Even as a child, he possessed an extraordinary insight. Though his age differed greatly from that of the late **Chángshǐ** (长史), he early formed a bond with the **Shénmíng** (神明) [Divine]. **Chángshǐ** (长史) recommended him to **Xiàng Wáng** (相王), who appointed him as a **Gōngfǔ Shèrén** (公府舍人) to serve personally. After **Jiǎnwén** (简文) ascended the throne, **Yáng Jūn** (杨君) was no longer seen in public. *(**Gù Yún** (顾云) said: \"He was **Jiǎnwén’s** (简文) teacher.\" Others said he was a **Bóshì** (博士).*\n\nYang was ten years younger than Emperor Jiǎnwén. *(All feared this might not be true.)*\n\nAccording to the *Zhēn Yùn* (真诰), he should have departed in the year *Tàiyuán* 11 (太元), in the year *Bīngxū* (丙戌). It was also said: *\"If one cannot endure wind and fire, one should cultivate the Dao of the sword’s sharpness and master the art of termination.\"* Thus, he likely passed away early—it need not have been in *Bīngxū*.\n\nUpon receiving his true office, his duties were roughly as described by Jiǔhuá (九华): to assist the *Dōnghuá* (东华), fulfilling the role of *Sīmìng* (司命). He oversaw and governed the spirits of *Wúyuè* (吴越), both gods and ghosts, all under his dominion.\n\nYang first received the *Zhōnghuáng* (中黄) *Zhìhǔbào* (制虎豹符) in the year *Yǒnghé* 5 (永和), *Jǐyǒu* (己酉). In the sixth year, *Gēngxū* (庚戌), he again received the *Língbǎo* (灵宝) *Wǔfú* (五符) from *Wèi Fūrén* (魏夫人), the eldest son of *Liú Pú* (刘璞). At that time, he was twenty-one years old. In the year *Xīngníng* 3 (兴宁), *Yǐchǒu* (乙丑), the *Zhēn* (真) descended upon him *(through oral transmission)*. He was thirty-six years old. The place of the descent was not fixed—sometimes in the capital, sometimes in his home, or in his mountain retreat.\n\nThe mountain retreat was still the **Léipíng Shān** residence of **Xǔ Chángshǐ** (许长史). Yang Heng often came to serve as his assistant—not from his own mountain dwelling.\n\nTo the right: the affairs of **Master Yang**—roughly as described above. Must be passed down and remembered further.\n\nAccording to the *Zhēn Gào* (真诰), it is said: *\"Fèng cháo gāo mù, sù yī shān\"* (凤巢高木，素衣衫然者)—this refers to **Chángshǐ’s** given name, **Kàng** (况).\n*\"Zēng Shēn chū tián\"* (曾参出田)—this refers to **Liéhé’s** (离合) courtesy name.\n**Xǔ Xiān Hóu** (许仙侯) and **Xǔ Qīng** (许卿)—these denote his attainment of the **True Rank** (得真位).\n**Jǐshì Chángshì** (给事常侍)—his secular office in this life.\n\nIt is also said: *\"Xǔ Zhāo\"* (许朝)—this is **Chángshǐ’s** uncle from **Nányáng** (南阳).\n*\"Yín shòu bái chǐ\"* (寅兽白齿)—this refers to **Hǔyá** (虎牙). It is also simply called *\"Yín shòu\"* (寅兽), *\"Yín kè\"* (寅客), or *\"Xǔ Hǔ\"* / *\"Xǔ Yá\"* (许虎/许牙).\n**Xǔ Zhǔbù** (许主簿)—this is the **Hǔyá’s rank**.\n**Huá Xīnfù** (华新妇)—this is **Hǔyá’s wife**, seemingly named **Hòu** (厚), also called **Xǔ Hòu** (许厚).\n**Huá Hóu** (华侯) and **Huá Shūlì** (华书吏)—these are **Hǔyá’s wife’s younger brothers**.\n*\"Qióng Rèn\"* (琼刃)—this is a metaphor for **Yuàn’s** (掾) childhood name, corresponding to *\"Ruò Fēng\"* (若锋) in the *Qīng Lù* (青录).\n*\"Qǐwàng rén fēi\"* (企望人飞)—this is the official title of **Liéhé Yuàn** (离合掾).\n\nIt is also said: *\"Xǔ [Quǎn Tuō] zǐ\"* (许｛犬托｝子)—this seems to be **Kuí’s** (揆) childhood name.\n*\"Yì Qiān Fūrén\"* (易迁夫人) and *\"Dǒu\"* (斗)—these refer to **Yuàn’s mother**, **Táo Kē** (陶科).\n*\"Wù yōu sì bó zhī guǐ\"* (勿忧嗣伯之诡)—this is **Chángshǐ’s younger brother’s** childhood name.\n*\"Lái zǐ suī shàn yú ěr\"* (来子虽善于尔)—this refers to **Chángshǐ’s stepmother**.\n*\"Dāng nài Zhāng zě hé\"* (当奈张者何)—this refers to **Chángshǐ’s concubine**.\n\n*\"Huáng É\"* (黄娥)—this is **Yá Yuàn’s mother-in-law**, originally named **Éhuáng** (娥皇), who married into the **Huáng** (黄) family, hence *\"Huáng É\"*.\n*\"Yǎn xiǎo zǐ ěr\"* (演小子耳)—this is **Huáng Yǎn** (黄演), **Éhuáng’s** son-in-law.\n*\"Chì Sūn\"* (赤孙)—this refers to **Hǔyá’s son**.\n\n**Three ascended** (登升者): *(Master, Chángshǐ, and Yuàn)*\n**Five who transcended the world** (度世者): *(Hǔyá, Huáng Mín, Róng Dì, Dàmā, Xiǎomā).*\n\nThe search for **Hǔyá** revealed that he attained immortality and surpassed the *Rénchén* limit—this must be the fate of one who transcends the world. The others left no visible trace.\n\n**Huáng Mín** transmitted the Dao’s teachings and scriptures, yet his lineage perished. There were strange omens, suggesting he might have foreshadowed his own example. The two others may also reappear among later descendants. If indeed seven generations mark the limit, then the blessed offspring of the Immortal True One shall truly be the bearers of this blessing.\n\n**Chángshǐ’s wife**, daughter of **Táo Wēi**, though she entered the **Yì Qiān** family, likely inherited the fortune of the **Táo** lineage alone—this need not concern the five of the **Xǔ** clan’s count.\n\nThere is mention of **Lǐ Dōng**—a ritual wine-pourer often employed by the **Xǔ** family, who was also **Master’s** teacher. His family hailed from **Qǔ’ē**. **Dōng** received the title of *Left Divine Sacrificial Wine-Pourer* from the Celestial Master **Jíyáng**. **Huá Xiáng**, a noble scion of **Jìnlíng**, tended to secular prayers. Initially, he was skilled in spirit-medium arts, often dreaming of feasting with the divine. Each time, he would sleep soundly without awareness, only to wake in a drunken stupor, vomit scattered about. The vulgar deities frequently employed his talents and directed his actions—before and after, numbering over ten such instances.\n\nThe **Zhēn** lineage’s son, **Zhuìzhōng**, was the one who bore this blessing—\n　　the **Chángshǐ**’s wife, **Táo Wēi**’s daughter. Though she entered the *Yì* sect, it was feared that this fortune was her own inheritance from the **Táo** family alone—no need to count among the five of the **Xǔ** clan’s descendants.\n\nThere is mention of **Lǐ Dōng**—a ritual wine-pourer often employed by the **Xǔ** family, who was also **Master’s** teacher.\n　　His family hailed from **Qǔ’ē**. **Dōng** received the title of *Left Divine Sacrificial Wine-Pourer* from the Celestial Master **Jíyáng**.\n\n**Huá Xiáng**, a noble scion of **Jìnlíng**, tended to secular prayers. When he transgressed, he was immediately punished for it. **Xiáng** grew resentful and vexed, and thus entered the Dao. He gained mastery over the ghostly arts, and gradually, true immortals began to visit him in dreams. At first, it was only in sleep, but after years, he would see their forms at midnight. When **Péi Qīnglíng** and **Zhōu Zǐyáng** arrived, they all sent him to relay their messages to the **Chángshǐ**. Yet **Xiáng** was of a hasty and reckless nature, often failing to convey the divine decrees accurately, and was thus reprimanded. He was then replaced by **Yáng Jūn**. Later, **Xiáng** became the magistrate of **Jiāngchéng** County (or **Jiāngshèng**), and his family settled there. Today, all the **Huá** of **Jiāngchéng** (or **Jiāngshèng**) are his descendants.\n\n（The **Huá** and **Xǔ** clans were related by marriage, hence the **Chángshǐ**’s letter to **Péi Qīnglíng**, urging him to extend warm invitations. If, as in the previous chapter, there was a warning to preserve life, then **Xiáng** would have been held guilty. Now, the tradition of **Zhōu Zǐyáng**’s transmission is what **Xiáng** established, hence its connection to the **Zhēn** revelations. Thus, the twenty-second scroll of the **Zhēn** revelations is linked to this account.）",

      "translated_text": "On the night of the tenth day of the eleventh month in the third year of the Shengping era, she descended. (Two characters here are cut off; they should be \"Yang Quan.\") From then on, she came and went, visiting as many as six times in a single month. She stated her original surname (one character is cut off; it should be \"Yang\") and presented (this character was originally \"Quan,\" later altered) a poem, along with a fire-washed cloth handkerchief, a gold *tiaotuo*, and a jade *tiaotuo*. The *tiaotuo* were exceptionally large and exquisitely crafted. The divine woman said (this character was originally written as \"Quan\" in cursive, later changed to \"see,\" with the stroke order adjusted): \"Sir, be careful not to reveal my presence. If you do, both of us will incur guilt.\" Upon inquiring, this person was said to be Luo Yu, a woman who attained the Dao in the Nine Doubt Mountains. In a past life, she had been poisoned to death by her master’s wife while serving as a wet nurse. As her previous sins had not been absolved in the Dark Realm, she was sent down to this foul and turbid world to atone for her transgressions. She gave (this \"Quan\" is also in cursive, resembling the previous form but not identical) the elixir for *shijie* to Yang Quan. Now, she resides in the mountains east of the Xiang River. (Originally, a small section was missing here.) This woman is already nine hundred years old.\n\n(Investigating this, it should be the descent to Yang Quan. Quan, styled Daoyu, was the youngest son of Yang Zhen. Later, he became the Yellow Gate Attendant for Emperor Jianwen of the Jin. He was also the grandfather of Yang Xin, who likewise practiced Daoist arts and ingested elixirs. This account was written by a certain Yang, likely because they shared the same surname, and thus inquired as if it were Yang Quan, recording the matter in detail in response.)\n\nIn the third year of Shengping (a *jiwei* year), six years before *yichou*, none of the Perfected had yet descended.\n\n---\n\nThe above three entries were hastily written by Yang on paper. The Lady of Southern Peak spoke to her disciple, recording the details as follows. (The disciple refers to Yang herself. This gathering of the Perfected seems to have taken place in the Grotto Palace, which is why the Director of Destinies is listed first, serving as the host. The Lady explained the ranks and titles to Yang in this manner, not during the descent to Yang.)\n\nThe Perfected Lord Director of Destinies of the Eastern Peak,\nThe Perfected Lord of the Nine Essences of the Eastern Palace, Grand Minister of the Golden Portal, the Great Lord Green Lad,\nThe Right Immortal Duke of Penglai, Jia Bao’an (a native of Zheng; from here onward, all are referred to by the *zi* of the Perfected, not their given names, with their clans and lineages also found in secular Daoist texts and records),\nThe Celestial King of Qingxu Xiaoyou, Wang Zideng (as the Green Lad holds a lofty and revered position, his given name is not dared to be mentioned; this Qingxu is the master of the Southern Peak, yet his *zi* is still used.

      "translated_text": "From this point onward, only the Registrar of Destinies’ transmission on the fifteenth day of the sixth month—a response to Director Xu’s letter discussing matters of Mount Mao—is recorded. Prior to this, there was another transmission, the date of which is not noted, both of which are contained in the fourth scroll. No earlier records exist before these.\n\nThe Northern Bright Lord’s Palace (the central administrative office of the celestial bureaus) once roamed the expanses of Heavenly Ford and gathered blossoms on Crimson Mound. At that time, its radiant presence stirred the sleeves of the numinous, and its dust-mantled splendor graced the lofty pines. (This refers to the initial descent upon the Huaqiao immortal.) From the resplendent peaks, its lofty discourse reached the distant clouds. It deemed itself stirred by the resonance of the mysterious, believing no path would remain obstructed. Bathed in the waves of the numinous, it truly hoped to share its glory with all things. Yet, unable to fully unfold its flourishing enterprise or wander freely among the peaks, it came to realize that in the moment of awakening, the response of the mysterious was minimal. Thus, it turned its carriage and returned, resting in stillness upon the kudzu terrace.\n\nFor the blade of the mysterious makes no partial distinctions, and the mirror of flowing insight eludes the untrue. If one assumes that a single ascent to the cloud-walled heights suffices, or that solitary strides alone achieve parity, then even the most humble beginnings may be cleansed, and every movement may subtly align with the hidden and the recondite. Only then will we all share in joy and sighs alike.\n\nIn the past, I saw that your intentions were deeply aligned with mine. The closing of your letter states: *\"I prostrate myself to behold the sagely record, its events profound and wondrous. The golden tally is plainly inscribed, the azure register divinely fixed. Thus, you transcend the dust of the mundane and wander freely in the Purple Yang. How pure and distant is your clarity, how exalted and rare your true nobility! Such is the mark of one who has attained the Way. I humbly request to borrow this as an analogy.\"*\n\nIt further states: *\"The steps to attaining the Dao are interwoven with the myriad spirits. To quiet the self and lodge in sincerity, to wash clean the heart and seek compassion—\"*",

      "translated_text": "Now let us set forth the origins of writing. When the creation of script first began, it was the time when the five colors first sprouted and the patterns of literature were fixed in form. It distinguished the intercourse of humanity and marked the division of yin and yang. Thus arose the Three Origins and Eight Convergences—the script of the myriad directions that soars through the heavens—and also the luminous chapters of the Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal. Later, in the age of the Two Sovereigns, the script of the Eight Convergences was expanded into the patterns of dragons and phoenixes. The traces of the Cloud Seal were refined to form the compliant shapes of Brahmi script. The two paths were sundered, the true and the mutable were separated, and the branches were matched to their roots, giving rise to the sixty-four kinds of writing. These were then disseminated across the thirty-six heavens and the ten directions above and below. Each took its own section and type, differing in use. Though their phonetic canons were uniform, their written traces diverged widely. Comparing and discussing them, the script of the Eight Convergences is the most authentic of writings, the progenitor of literary patterns. The Cloud Seal and Luminous Script are its root and origin, the beginning of all writing. The script of the Three Origins and Eight Convergences is now used by the august Highest Ultimate and the pure transcendents of the highest heavens. The chapters of the Cloud Seal and Luminous Script are what we now see as the characters of divine talismanic writing.\n\nYet in the later flourishing age, false and chaotic inventions arose. Together they crafted clever but trivial forms, pursuing shortcuts in inferior script. All were but flowing corpses of defiled literature and licentious, perverse characters—abandoning the root to imitate the false, mere clamorous and filthy dead traces. Why would a true transcendental being discard the authentic and essential script to draw with their own hand the licentious and disordered characters of the lower realms? One who has attained the rank of true person has mastered the real in every matter. How could they alone indulge in the trivial arts of the vulgar, the corrupt practices of superficiality, clinging to them without change and delighting in them without transformation?",

      "translated_text": "When a person is in the world, those who were first skilled in writing and adept in affairs—once they attain true transcendence—will find that even the transformations of external script naturally reverse themselves along with their person. Those whose true affairs are all near at hand no longer discard the defiled script they have already mastered; rather, they first receive instruction in the superior script and only afterward come to know the true writing anew. The way of ghosts is likewise, though their characters may slightly deviate.\n\nMoreover, with the numinous brush and true hand, they dare not descend to commune with fleshly beings. Even when there are those who have attained the Dao but whose bodies have not yet transcended the world, they still dare not lower their hands to display inked characters, revealing them in written traces. As for talismanic texts and divine verses—those sought and worn—they have been crafted from the very beginning. The reason for this is that worldly people fundamentally cannot fathom their origins, and it also prevents us from concealing anything. In the unseen realm, they are mutually understood; within and without, they are reciprocally connected.\n\nFurthermore, the luminous statutes of the Four Poles and the prohibitions of the Most High are weighty, and they naturally do not permit us to again produce ordinary script for the world. Since I have already set my hand to this, and you surely do not comprehend, why would we pursue both paths and invite superfluous trouble? This, too, should be discerned in silence as to its propriety—it is hardly worth reproach. I imagine it may slightly ease the congestion in your heart, fully distinguishing you from those who do not write of themselves.\n\nThe Supreme Perfected Controller of Destinies, the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, transmitted this command as follows:\n\nWhen one casts the cloud-wheel aloft, reins in the vast emptiness, hands guiding the celestial net, feet ascending the Jade Court, body rising to the imperial palace, parting the jeweled canopy of azure—above, discoursing on the transcendent measures of the Nine Mysteries; below, recording the great life of the myriad kalpas—then one startles the lightning of radiance into solemnity, and a thousand rosy clouds blaze with brilliance. True words surge like dark waves; lofty discourse resounds in the Jade Clarity. Crimson lips unleash flowing splendor; the sun’s qi scatters in droplets. Then one exhales beacons to repel smoke, strikes gold to play jade, where luan-bird songs bloom in radiance and phoenix chants resound in fine harmony.\n\nYet if one merely descends in response to the scene, turning back to the dust of the mortal realm, riding in a tattered carriage through the morning market, coming to perfect true talent and instructing my disciples—then jade chimes fall in muted resonance, and jasper bells are inwardly restrained. The eyes survey the Five Defilements; the heart contracts in the chamber of transgressions. The spirit labors amidst foul stench; the nose fills and the breath is held. Thus, the orchid tones of the Central Prime are sealed, and one retreats to strike the golden sounds, faint and faltering, to be heard.\n\nThe words of the divine are subtle when near, yet they reach across ten thousand leagues. Though rare melodies may touch the ear, the mirror of reflection remains unobstructed. Thus, once the principles of the true are distinguished, hearing from afar, the Dao ascends in lofty progression. Unpolished jade does not display its luster, yet it may still give rise to base and trivial perceptions.\n\nNow you have arrived at the utmost of awakened intention, yet you entertain thoughts of suspicion and resemblance. Externally, you observe the responses of the vulgar; internally, you harbor hesitations and realizations. If you do not act in accord with what is fitting, you have already gone astray. What you should aspire to is the Dao; what you should ponder and chant is the wondrous. Once the Dao and the wondrous are attained, the sounds of high and low will surely become level.\n\nThis is not a matter for deliberation. You, my disciple, should apply the deepest consideration, dispersing these thoughts. Be cautious in this.\n\nThe three clauses above were written by Yang. On the night of the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, the Lady of the Southern Marchmount bestowed this command. Previously, on the evening of the twenty-second day, there was a discussion on the Dao in a separate chamber. The Ladies of the Purple Tenuity and the Southern Marchmount spoke in voices and tones markedly inferior, their intent incomprehensible.",

Only after the transmission was complete did I, the disciple, perceive that my complexion alone bore disquiet—nothing else could be spoken of. (This passage is also recorded by Master Yang as his own account.)\n\nThat evening, the Lady of the Southern Marchmount addressed me, saying: \"Tomorrow I shall journey to the Qingxu Palace on Mount Wangwu. Let this be known to you as my destination.\" Later that same night, she added: \"On the western slope of Mount Tongbai by the Eastern Sea, a landslide has just collapsed some two hundred zhang.\" The Lady of Purple Tenuity, Wang, remarked: \"How could the thoughts and concerns of worldly people ever attain true clarity in every matter? Should one not simply respond to what their hearts seek?\" The Lady of the Southern Marchmount spoke in jest, intending to affirm and establish it.\n\nIn the third year of the Xingning reign, the year *yichou*, on the night of the twenty-fifth day of the sixth month—(This marks the beginning of the Lady An’s descent, recorded separately in another scroll; hence the reign year and cyclical sign are noted anew)—the Lady of Purple Tenuity, Wang, descended once more, accompanied by a divine maiden. The maiden wore a cloud-brocade robe, its upper part cinnabar-red and lower part azure, resplendent with luminous patterns. At her waist hung a green embroidered sash, from which dangled over ten small bells, their colors alternating between azure and yellow. On her left side she bore a jade pendant, similar to those worn in the mortal world, though slightly smaller. Her garments, though dark, gleamed with a radiance that illuminated the chamber, as if sunlight were reflecting upon mica.\n\nHer hair—(this should read *fazhen*, denoting lustrous black tresses)—was arranged with unparalleled precision: coiled into a topknot at the crown, with the remaining locks cascading down to her waist. Her fingers bore golden rings, and white pearls adorned her arms. She appeared to be about thirteen or fourteen years of age. Flanking her were two attendants.\n\nOne attendant wore crimson robes and carried a green-patterned satchel, in her hands a brocade pouch measuring one or two *chi* in length, containing some ten scrolls.

      "translated_text": "The white casket resembled one made of ivory. The two attendants appeared to be about seventeen or eighteen years of age, exquisitely adorned. The goddess and her attendants bore radiant complexions, lustrous and translucent as jade, suffused with the fragrance of five incenses—like the scent of *xiangying* (a foreign incense known as \"infant fragrance\") burning.\n\nAs they entered the chamber, they followed behind the Lady of the Purple Tenuity. Once the lady had stepped inside, she announced, \"Today, a noble guest has come to visit and converse with us.\" Thereupon, I rose to my feet. The lady said, \"There is no need to stand. We shall simply sit together and exchange courtesies.\" The Lady of the Purple Tenuity sat facing south, while I, that evening, first sat beneath the dais, facing west. The goddess then joined us on the same couch, facing east. Each of us performed the greeting with our left hands. Once the courtesies were complete, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity said, \"This is the youngest daughter of the Golden Terrace Lady Li, the Supreme Perfected of the Great Void. The Supreme Perfected of the Great Void once sent her to Mount Gui to study the Dao of the Highest Clarity. After mastering the Way, she received the scriptures of the Most High and was appointed as the True Consort of the Nine Florets of the Purple Clarity Upper Palace. Thus, she was bestowed the surname An, the given name Yupin, and the style Lingxiao.\"\n\nThe Lady of the Purple Tenuity then asked me, \"Have you ever encountered such a person in the mortal world?\" I replied, \"Her divine grace and lofty refinement defy comparison.\" The lady laughed heartily and asked, \"And what of you?\" I made no further reply.\n\nThe True Consort of Purple Clarity sat for a long while without speaking. In her hand, she held three dates, their color like dried jujubes but larger in form, without pits and lacking the taste of dates—rather, they resembled the flavor of pears. She first offered one to me, then gave another to the Lady of the Purple Tenuity, keeping the last for herself. She instructed us to eat them, and once we had finished, after a short while, the True Consort asked my age and the month of my birth. I promptly answered, \"Thirty-six, born in the ninth month of the *gengyin* year.\"\n\nThe True Consort then said, \"Your teacher, the Lady of the Southern Perfection, holds authority over the Director of Destinies and possesses a Dao of sublime and perfect attainment—truly the paragon of noble virtue. I have long heard of your virtuous reputation and never imagined we would meet today to forge this joyous karmic bond. May our connection endure through the unseen workings of fate, like intertwining pine and vine.\"\n\nThereupon, I gave my name in reply, saying, \"I am mired in the dust of the vulgar world, my essence tainted by its filth. Though I aspire to rise, I am unworthy to receive such divine favor, which I have so undeservedly been granted.\"",

Mao,\nAnd another person—\nYoung in years, of extraordinary refinement,\nWearing a lotus crown and crimson robes,\nWith white pearls sewn along the seams,\nA sword at his waist, the like of which had never been seen.\nThis person often spoke of matters concerning Mount Jinting,\nConversing with the host of Perfected Ones.\nThere were also words beyond comprehension.\nHe bowed in reverence to the Three Perfected Ladies of Purple Tenuity, Purple Clarity, and the Southern Marchmount,\nWhile with the others he spoke as equals.\nHe was said to be Wang Ziqiao, the Perfected of Mount Tongbai.\nThroughout, he did not exchange a word with [Your] Master.\n\nMoreover, when Perfected Ones first descended in earlier encounters,\nThey likewise did not immediately engage in conversation.\nEach sat for a long while.\nThen the Perfected Consort of Purple Clarity said,\n\"I wish to trouble your hand once more to record something,\nThat I may dispel lingering thoughts and

the Purple Sovereign,\nAnd wielded the jade axe of the Heavenly Emperor.\nI received texts from the Consort of the Upper Perfected,\nThat I might wander the Jade Clarity.\nOften, I personally opened the ninefold gates of Luo,\nTrod the dark chambers with my feet,\nSoared through the numinous void,\nGazed upon the roots of the sun,\nEntered the feasts of the seven palaces,\nAnd emerged driving cloud chariots.\nI gathered the three luminaries to ascend together,\nScattered radiant clouds to fly my carriage.\n\nNot that I could not have chosen a lofty chamber,\nSought among the purple youths,\nOr found a worthy companion in the Jade Palace,\nTo pair with a transcendent spirit and form a union,\nJoining the marvelous and guiding the wondrous,\nBecoming a companion to the Imperial Lad.\nYet it was I who followed the turning of the mechanism and entrusted myself to fate,\nAnswered the reckoning of destiny,\nStooped to the dust and foam,\nDescended with the dragons,\nSummoned the hidden and sought the heroic,\nPursued those who matched my company.\n\nFrom the beginning, our karmic bond was destined,\nAnd so there was an inked pact to fix our names,\nA pristine covenant in the Jade Realm,\nA shared governance of twin blessings.\nWe journeyed side by side like wild geese,\nShared the gourd cup’s flavor,\nBound our robes with the wine-stained sash,\nAnd attended to the inner chamber’s duties.\nSuch was the treasury of true methods.\nProceeding thus, our fates were already inscribed in the unseen records,\nOur names written in the Azure Books of the Upper Prime.\nTherefore, the heart’s inclinations toward refinement or vulgarity were already equal,\nAnd the bounds of affection in the face of beauty were already set.\nHaving attained our wishes, we roamed with joy surpassing past intentions—\nWas this not the workings of nature’s spontaneity?\nThis, again, is the great principle of the two images,\nThe appointed roles of inner and outer union.\n\nTruly, it is not that I sought to alter the unchanging or return to simplicity,\nTo congeal emotions with the blade of emptiness,\nTo wield the numinous knife sevenfold,\nTo abandon the task of the Great Plain,\nTo preserve the true and open the jade,\nOr to speak of the solitary radiance of the eight voids.\nRather, it is the flourishing stillness of lofty purity,\nThe luxuriant chariot of flowing clouds,\nWhere phoenixes sing on the paths of heaven,\nDragons chant and tigers roar,\nThe celestial sovereigns of twin radiance,\nFar ascending the starry towers,\nFlying stars casting their light,\nSun and moon illuminating the body,\nMouth exhaling dark mist,\nEyes flashing lightning.\nAbove, I repose in the jade chambers,\nWandering through the Jade Clarity,\nHand grasping radiant clouds,\nFeet treading Mount Jinting.\n\nIf, from this time onward,\nAt the moment of attaining the Dao,\nShould one thoroughly exhaust both inner and outer,\nHarmonizing principle with the unyielding like metal and stone,\nEntwining affections in dual devotion,\nUniting hearts within the bed curtains—\nOr must one embrace the shared quilt and equal care,\nYet still have fleeting encounters,\nDefiling the seven spirits,\nGrieving the soul and burdening the hun and po?\n\nThis is merely my inquiry to you, O Illustrious One, regarding lineage—\nThere is no impropriety in it.\nNow, having realized our aspirations and embraced the true,\nOur hearts are as one.\nWe shall soon join our chariots in the Jade Void,\nJourney together to the Northern Mystery,\nPluck the crimson fruits in the Jade Orchard,\nGather the cinnabar blossoms in the [Gate of Goodness] Garden,\nShare the waters of the Purple River,\nBathe together on the banks of the Azure Stream.\nClad in

The meaning of embodying worthiness is made manifest in the unseen workings of fate. Guard your heart against the doubts of the Yellow and the Red.”\n\nThe Lord of Mao Peak bestowed a writ, saying: “The mysterious standard touches the luminous scene; bowing low, it harmonizes with the dust and mist. The jade chime sounds in the chamber of transgression; the pure wind soars free. Can you not be exhorted to this?” With these words, the perfected ones departed. The True Consort lingered briefly behind, saying: “I trouble you, Illustrious Lord, to compose one more verse.” And she bestowed a writ, saying:\n\n“Forget the orchid’s purity, and let your radiant heart align in perfect accord. Soon you shall frequently and reverently purify the celestial precincts, where your virtue will merge with the flowing light. It is fitting that joy arise from the principle of union. Lead the flourishing and submit to the measure. Illustrious Lord, your lofty spirit shines—cast aside stagnation and forget baseness.”\n\nWith these words, she took his hand and stepped down from the couch. Before they reached the doorway, she suddenly vanished.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month, eight perfected ones descended: the Lady of the Left of Purple Tenuity, first; the True Consort of the Nine Flowers of the Upper Clarity Palace, second; the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, Controller of Destinies and Perfected of the Upper Realms, third; the Perfected of Purple Yang, fourth; the Perfected of Pure Numinosity, fifth; the Lord of Mao Peak, sixth; the Lesser Lord of Mao, seventh; and one other, very young and poised, wearing a lotus crown and a crimson robe with a sword at her side—one never before seen. It was surmised she might be the Perfected Wang Ziqiao of Mount Tongbai. Much was discussed of matters on Mount Jinting, though many words were unintelligible.\n\nThe Perfected of Purple Tenuity and the Upper Perfected of the Nine Flowers Consort were revered. All bowed and addressed themselves as “your subordinate.”\n\nThe Upper Perfected said: “Yesterday, I went with Shushen to the Palace of Pure Emptiness to review the gains and losses of the perfected as immortals. Recently, forty-seven were abruptly removed, and only three were restored. We also reviewed the registers of your names, and all is well now. Xu is listed among the foremost ranks.” (Xu was the name of the Prefect; Yang Jun had submitted a memorial, so the name was not recorded.)\n\n“I did not initially realize it was like this—how much better it is! His diligent refinement of the heart, his devotion to principle, his heart like cinnabar and intent exhausted—he treads as though upon ice and fire. If he persists thus, even the perfected cannot escape, nor can the Dao of immortality remain hidden. He must only sever all thoughts of lust and desire, and we shall soon be able to meet. This should be made clear to him.” These were the words of the Lady of the Southern Marchmount.\n\nThe Lord of Mao Peak said: “Boju is in my charge. The Great Venerable One will surely take note. In the lands east of the Yangtze, none has been seen so devoted to the Dao. Yet do not rely on Boju’s rank and forget the Way. Falsehood is the sickness of virtue; ostentation is the calamity of the body. Stagnation is the first loss; shame is the lock of the body. Dispel these four difficulties, and only then may one inquire of the Dao.”\n\nThen the numinous chariot’s traces resounded, and the day grew faint. “If there is any thought of transgression, do not practice the Way of the Upper Perfected. Yesterday, I saw the Palace of Pure Emptiness strike these names from the rolls, and they were then subjected to examination and punishment, their fates handed over to the Three Bureaus. Can one not be cautious?”\n\nThe words to the right are those of the Lady of the Southern Marchmount: “Prefect Xu, be mindful during the year of mourning for the deceased.

Though Prefect Xu has already been {temporarily} removed, he must be repeatedly purged again and again.\" (These are the words of the Pure Numinous One.)\n\nThe Eastern Minister of Destiny knows well Prefect Xu’s reverent solemnity. The Lesser Heavenly King inquired yesterday: \"Where does this man now reside? What Dao does he cultivate?\" The Eastern Minister replied: \"He is a scholar of my native region.\" (By \"native region,\" this refers to Jurong and Mount Mao sharing the same territory—not that he is originally from Xianyang.) \"Inwardly, he is enlightened and upright; outwardly, he blends with worldly affairs. Truly a man of fine talent. Now he cultivates the Dao of the Upper Perfected.\" These words accord with human sentiment, though they bear a trace of ostentation.

Seven times he has ascended in trailing robes; rapt, he congeals in the Grotto Chamber. Once inner burdens are dissolved, both hun and po grow supple. Guard this without weariness; accumulate it without cease. The Five Difficulties dispelled, he shall be enfeoffed as a marquis. (The sevenfold ascent refers to the practice of flying paces; the Grotto Chamber, to the affairs of the Cavernous Chamber.)\n\nThe above is what the Lady of the Purple Tenuity conveyed, to be shown to Prefect Xu.\n\nThe following entry was written by the Prefect himself:\nThe Lady of the Purple Tenuity instructed: \"Unfurl the side-clouds of the flowery canopy...\" (This matter appears in the third scroll.)\n\nOn the night of the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month, this was written. The following entry bears Yang’s calligraphy:\n\nWhen accumulated essence evokes response, the myriad things all answer. If subtle sincerity is not yet complete, then the radiance of form remains imperfect. If the radiance of form is imperfect, then within the Grotto Chamber, clarity shall not be immediately attained. When I first received this method, I would always visualize it toward the northwest. Visualizing the northwest as small makes it easier to perceive. This may be clearly demonstrated thus. (The northwest is the luminous axis of Heaven and Earth, the mysterious gate of inner illumination.)\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month, this was conveyed by the Purple Yang.

Lord Pei’s follower bore a staff adorned with green tassels, and one attendant carried an embroidered satchel. Lord Zhou’s follower bore a staff adorned with yellow tassels (without a satchel). These two passages were written in Master Jia’s own hand.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month, the Perfected Consort of Ninefold Splendor bestowed this writing, saying:\n\nWhen twin luminaries shine in response, clouds gather and the mysterious descends. The dragon flourishes in the five voids, plucking jade upon the {Gate of Goodness} Terrace. A long chant in the numinous {scarf’s silence}, the jade portals open in radiance. How distant are the affairs left behind, forever parted from the world! Crimson waves bear the rosy chariot, lightning hastens to the purple abode. Together we carry the resonance beyond purity, roaming the cloudy peaks and boundless cliffs. Is this not excellence? Is this not joy?\n\nThe sun is the fruit of the rosy clouds; the rosy clouds are the essence of the sun. You have only heard of the method for ingesting the sun’s fruit, yet have not seen or known the art of consuming the clouds’ essence. The Scripture of Cloud-Consuming is most secret, but the Way of Attracting Clouds is most easy. This is called the method of embodying life so that jade radiance and rosy clouds illumine the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe eyes are the body’s mirrors; the ears are the body’s {leaf-gates}. Gazing excessively dims the mirrors; listening too much seals the {leaf-gates}. I possess the stone for polishing mirrors and the technique for unsealing {leaf-gates}. With these, one may penetrate the myriad spirits and subtly perceive the most distant echoes. Is this acceptable?\n\nThe face is the courtyard of the spirit; the hair is the blossom of the brain. When the heart grieves, the face {scorches}; when the brain diminishes, the hair whitens. Thus the inner essence is lost, and the cinnabar fluids are depleted. I possess the Scripture of Youthful Countenance and the method for restoring whiteness. Is this acceptable?\n\nEssence is the spirit of the body; clarity is the treasure of the self.

      "translated_text": "The Nineflower Perfected Consort descended together with the Lady of the Purple Tenuity and the Lady of the Southern Marchmount. After the Perfected Consort had sat for a long while, she commanded her attendant maidens to open the brocade satchel and produce two scrolls, which she presented for transcription. Their titles are as follows:\n\n*The Esoteric Writ of the Jade Radiance and Purple Glow: An Inner Vision*\n*The Scripture of Returning to Dawn and Rejoining the Sun’s Light: The Central Mystery of the Youthful Brilliance*\n\n(These two titles should properly belong to the scriptures of the Three Origins and Eight Convergences. Since Master Yang has thoroughly mastered the true characters, they are now rendered in clerical script for clarity.)\n\nOn the night of the first day of the seventh month, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity, the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, the Nineflower Perfected Consort, Ziyang, Tongbai, the Three Perfected Ones of Pristine Emptiness, and the Second Lord of Mao descended together. After a long while, I humbly presented myself before the assembled spirits, seeking the art of securing my person, desiring to know the distinction between noble and base, the convergence of lifespan and destiny, and the fixed limits of longevity. Thereupon the Perfected Consort smiled. After a long pause, she bestowed upon me this writing, which states:\n\nThe illustrious lord possesses a nature of serene simplicity, his mind untrammeled and bright. His virtue flows like an orchid spring, his pure resonance echoes through the golden palace. Truly, he is one who treasures hidden marvels, whose inner radiance shines with the light of secluded perfection. His spirit soars through the numinous scriptures, riding the numbers to harmonize with life. His pristine power dwells in the divine garden, his cinnabar record inscribed in the Jade Purity. He ascends in mist, seizing the light, his dark drum sounding afar. He is destined to become one of the Three Excellencies, attending the Celestial Emperor at dawn, a lofty assistant to the Four Counsels, bearing the commands of the Sagely Lord. He shall govern life and sever death, reward and punish spirits, command the thousand numina, seal mountains and summon clouds. He shall oversee the harmonious qi of yin and yang and be appointed as the Lord of the Ghosts and Spirits of Wu and Yue.\n\nAs for me, I was born of the flowering essence, my destiny congealed in contemplation. I soar through the nine heavens on the wings of the void, my ethereal voice riding the whirlwind chamber. Following the turning of the Four Awakenings, I ascend the mysterious ladder in unison with the image. My purple name is recorded in the Supreme, my pure script among the Eight Effulgences. My spirit illumines the western glow, my power shines within the inner ranks. Thus, I received the scriptures and rode the qi, attaining the office of Perfected Consort.\n\nMoreover, I am to assist you in unifying the Three Huos, governing the myriad spirits, facing the North Emperor to receive your mandate, and issuing decrees to the mountains. We are also fated to join sleeves in the numinous chamber, riding the mist of the Seven Origins, gathering in the rare grove, our inner thoughts intertwined in karmic affinity. Therefore, your surname is Yang, and I am named An. I descended from the mysterious origin, while you received the scriptures in the Western Palace.

When I witness your leisurely ascent, I am truly overjoyed; when I observe your setbacks, my countenance darkens with sorrow. These two emotions manifest upon my face, yet they are hardly sufficient to give rise to profound lament or enduring grief.\n\nAs for the hidden depths where kindred spirits meet, where black-haired companions share a love for the mysterious, where the light wheel of dust and mist intermingles with the forms of the worldly abode—how could I, on account of fleeting transgressions or the lowly bonds of youthful stagnation, bring shame upon the steadfast essence of one destined for transcendence? For yin and yang stand in opposition, and fortune and misfortune reverse their course. The two images being arrayed, gain and loss intertwine—these are but the paths of coming and going.\n\nNow, those who dwell in the flourishing respite of the windblown dust are often the sinful ghosts of the lower realms, the doomed essences hastening toward death. Only by abiding in uselessness amid the clamor of the world does one attain the uncarved simplicity of the true; only by embracing the ordinary within and gazing inward does one plant the root of numinous immortality. Wealth and nobility, indulgence and splendor—these are the axes and saws that break the bones, akin to the carts and boats that bear the condemned. Glory and pride, contention and the pursuit of fleeting advantage—these are but the means to invite transgression and humiliation, the weapons that sever the thread of life. They are no fine thing.\n\nThus, the lofty ones of antiquity, perceiving the difficulty of foreseeing faults and the impossibility of enjoying wealth and honor, retreated into the depths of secluded forests, dwelling in the radiance of renowned mountains. They chewed the harmonious qi, rinsed and bathed in pure streams, seeking to distance themselves from these evil traces and secure their own abundant blessings. They soared freely, preserving their pristine essence.\n\nWhy, then, should you hasten after the distinctions of noble and base in the human realm, casting yourself into the marketplace of glory and disgrace? Moreover, the days of clashing armies draw near, and the three disasters approach. Divine winds sweep away the foul, and putrid vapors rise to the heavens. Bright metal is born in filth and mire, precious jade is cast into dung to attract dust. Cold garments are shaken free of blood, impure essence depletes the true.

      "translated_text": "After speaking at length, on the night of the sixth day of the seventh month, the Lord of Life descended again. Following a long interval, he instructed the scribe, saying:\n\n\"If one must model oneself upon Fan Xuan, grasping the celestial patterns in purity rare among the age, then one may pluck the hidden blossoms of the deep and soar to lofty perches, tasting the resonance of supreme accord. Like still waters mirroring a mountain’s steadfast peak, the jade-like script lies desolate—yet to those who play with the treasures of the spirit, it awakens. Casting off worldly attachments, one tunes the zither of the pure and numinous, clarifying the luminous scene within emptiness. The Five Ways unfold in clarity, their hues transcending the waves of transformation. Desires merge with the insipid; emptiness unites with the obscure thoroughfare. Without sight, without hearing, one then approaches the subtle truth of the perfected. Profound awakening arises anew, inner virtue rounds into completion, and the spirit’s banner stands replete without. In the end, one may spur the clouds to ascend the heavens, inscribing the cinnabar records of the Lord of Life.\n\nYet if essence scatters amid ten thousand thoughts, life cannot be made firm. Drifting with the dust and waves, the heart fails to unite in truth—sufficient only to weary body and spirit among the crags. This would indeed mislead those who come to learn. Is the Way subtle and easy to seek, or is it arduous and difficult to attain?\n\nLet this also be shown to Attendant Xu. (These two entries were again transcribed by the Attendant.) Attendant Xu desires to dwell in the mountains. Those who honor the Dao prize freedom from perversity; those who nestle in truth find peace in tranquil joy. Profound stillness is not the host of grand compliance, nor is fiery zeal the master of instruction. Thus, one must employ the vexations of the world to comprehend the absence of them. Is this not the meaning?\n\nChange and decay—why must they follow the four seasons? Qi flows like breath; a thousand years pass like a lodging. Should Master Zhao not be concerned? One who trusts without doubt has already ripened in heart.\"\n\nThe Lord of Life spoke thus to the Lady of South Mountain: \"Those who cultivate the Way ever dwell in profound tranquility and solitude, each time settling the spirit to wander in leisure. Content in their sustenance, they find sufficiency.\"",

Radiant with luminous splendor, they gathered and absorbed the five numina, roamed the nine paths of the Dao, ascended the primordial to purify their forms, and cast their thoughts beyond the void. With no worldly affairs to entangle them, they sealed and stored the three qi, refined the wondrous essences—thus reversing the years of the sun’s decline and reverting to the state of infancy.\n\nYet if one’s affairs pile up like grains of sand, if carriages clog the roads, and if one’s resolve cannot be steadfastly upheld—how can the trials and verifications be brought to a halt?

      "translated_text": "The flowery canopy follows the clouds in their tilt,\nmy tranquil rest surpasses ninefold measures.\nRight and wrong do not occupy my mind—\nembracing truth, I dwell in the Great Stillness.\n\nGolden *zi* (here corrected to \"form\")—how could it compare\nto the filth and foulness of the world,\nwhere life is bleak and without solace?\n\nOn the night of the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month,\nCloud Grove’s Right Radiance Lady composed and transmitted this.\n\nThree reins raise the purple carriage,\nclouds tilt toward the eastern forest’s slope.\nRight Radiance chanted this Dao,\nand from the right, thirteen soaring verses came—\nall in Yang’s hand, with some passages transcribed by scribes.\n\nTo dispel stagnation and stinginess,\none must rely on exhausting virtue’s practice—\nis this not most excellent?\nDo not fear that virtue will go unrewarded,\nbut rather that the planting of blessings is too meager.\nThis single line may well be a field of fortune.\nAll matters are thus—\none may infer the rest by analogy.\n\nOn the third day of the twelfth month,\nCloud Grove’s Right Radiance Lady spoke.\nThis passage is in Yang’s hand,\nwith another version slightly variant.\n\nMu, humbly and with awe, says:\nYour boundless benevolence,\ngraciously bestowing new poems—\ncloud-like elegance woven in brocade,\ngolden tones and jade-like brilliance—\ntruly the rarest bloom of the literary grove,\nthe grandest display of embroidered splendor.\nTheir meaning runs deep and subtle,\ngazing upward, one finds no limit.\nI wear them in my cinnabar heart,\ncherishing them in every turn.\nThough my merit is shallow and crude,\nthe unseen recompense is already weighty.\nThe metaphor of the field of fortune—\nhow dare I not rouse myself?\nRelying on your noble guidance,\nmy gratitude is as vast as mountains and seas.\nIn movement and stillness, I seek enlightenment—\nI hope you will deign to record my plea.\n\nMu, humbly and with awe, says:\nPresented before the loom of Cloud Grove’s Right Radiance Lady.\n(This is the reply to the letter on dispelling stagnation and stinginess,\nwith a draft preserved.)\n\nThe Azure Lad often chants:\n\"To plant the roots of extinction,\none must uproot the seeds of life and death.\nBrooding, one sinks into the nine springs—\nall for clinging to this bodily frame.\"\n\nThe Master of the Great Void often chants:\n\"Observe when spirit bears form—\nit is like a cart following a horse.\nWhen the cart breaks, the horse bolts and flees,\ndragging along this transient union.\nAlas, the world does not recognize this—\nall they cherish is the wind and fire.\nPlanting sins in the heavenly net,\nthey suffer poison in the hells below.\"\n\nThe Perfected of Western City, Lord Wang, often chants:\n\"Spirit is the boat that ferries form,\nbut the shallow shore is where they must part.\nForm is not spirit’s eternal abode,\nspirit is not form’s constant bearer.\nWandering the wheel of life and death,\nthey suffer only from hesitation of heart.\"\n\nThe Perfected of Lesser Existence, Lord Wang, often chants:\n\"Losing the Dao, one follows the ford of death,\nthe three souls stray from the path of life.\nThe day of life grows ever distant,\nthe day of death arrives all too soon.\nAlas, the sorrowful face of suffering—\nroots and blossoms already inverted.\nRising to meet the kalpa’s fall,\nhow can one know the return to withered age?\"\n\nOn the autumn equinox of the previous month,\nat the Jade Terrace Grand Assembly,\nthe four lords each chanted these words,\nharmonizing with the strings of the *Xuanjun Guangshao*.\n(In the tenth month, it was said \"the previous month\"—\nhere corrected to \"between,\" for the autumn equinox must fall in the eighth month,\nthus \"the previous month\" naturally makes sense.)\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the tenth month,\nRight Radiance Lady spoke this and ordered it recorded.\nThese five passages are in the scribes’ hand.\n\nThe four luminaries shine in the void,\nthe vermilion carriage flies over the numinous mound.\nThe jade canopy shades the seven radiances,\ndrums and feathered banners float above the clouds.\nThe nine tones resound through the purple void,\njade echoes pierce the Great Nonbeing.\nFeasting and chanting in the palace of the three luminaries,\nsinging and calling to our companions—\nunaware that the *chun* tree has already come,\nhow could we know the flow of the two effulgences?\nThough the fair one may forget both,\na hundred sorrows are not yet released.\nThe long forest is truly still,\nin the cliffs, there is much delight.\n\nOn the seventeenth day of the tenth month,\nCloud Grove Lady composed this for Lord Xu.\n\nGrasping the jade flowery canopy in her left hand,\nshe rides the radiance, treading the seven origins.\nThe three luminaries gleam with purple brilliance,\nshe rises and gazes, caressing the bright Perfected.\nIn an instant, she leaps and transforms—\nall four sides are already divine.\nHer numinous hair knows no bounds,\nearnestly pondering the scriptures of the Upper Clarity.\nWhy does this random *shuiyu* arise,\ncausing you to lose focus?\nLosing the *xuan* mechanism in a flash—\nunaware that the years have parted.\n\nOn the eighteenth day of the tenth month.",

      "translated_text": "The Lord of Life Preservation addresses this.\n\nThe two preceding passages from Yang’s letter are indeed most truthful. In response to the missive of the twenty-ninth day of the eleventh month: those who attain the Dao do so by their ability to cast off all encumbrances and advance directly toward it. Thus, all affairs become purified of themselves, and every duty disperses like clouds. For those already endowed with excellence, this is no labor; for those who struggle through hardship, it may serve to manifest the heart. In the first month, a guest from Mount Gui will surely come to the Eastern Mountain. At that time, could you not lend your full strength?\n\nHaving read your noble command, my joy is boundless. Since the beginning of this month, both public and private matters have pressed upon my hand, preventing me from following my heart’s desire. Once the *zanzu* arrives in the capital, I shall reckon the days for the return journey, bathe, and personally attend court to pay homage—all within this month. If the auspicious day has not yet passed, I humbly request your instruction.\n\nMoreover, regarding the conduct of the worthy, it warrants further scrutiny. Before receiving the supreme Dao, there were those who sought to sway others’ minds and those who claimed to be capable of refinement and encouragement. After receiving the hidden scriptures, such schemes all vanish into obscurity.\n\n*(Here two characters are damaged, and a line has been trimmed away. Later, it appears there was further text. This discussion of the worthy’s conduct seems to continue from the previous letter, responding to the missive of the twenty-ninth day of the eleventh month. That earlier letter is no longer extant, and its wording differs. It also mentioned the guest from Mount Gui arriving in the first month. This reply may thus correspond to the Perfected Record Keeper’s later address, or perhaps such words were also included in Lady Youying’s letter. The record is incomplete, and clear evidence is lacking.)*\n\nThe two preceding pieces are copies in the Long Historian’s own hand. Let the diligent be diligent in their affairs, and let them immerse themselves in the profound subtleties. The cautious, too, may draw parallels and act accordingly. The difficulty of studying the Dao cannot be put into words. Those who feel shame at vulgarity are still far from the Way. Only after thorough cultivation may one attain true worth.\n\nThe worthy’s conduct must begin anew. For now, one should inwardly forget.\n\nThe Purple Tenuity Lady spoke these words.\n\n*(This is the Purple Tenuity’s response to the Long Historian’s reply to Lady Youying regarding the worthy’s conduct. After the Long Historian’s wife passed away, he wished to take a concubine and attend to the affairs of the Seven Primes household, both of which are strictly forbidden. Hence, the matter is repeatedly addressed.)*",

One must set one’s heart truly upon this deliverance.\n\n**Record of the Register of Destinies.**\n\n*(This is the Central Lord’s response to the Long Historian’s reply to Lady Youying, further praising his words.)*\n\nThe heart has already arrived—there is no need to journey to the mountains. Those who empty their minds to face the Real, who offer single-minded sincerity to float upon the Dao—though they may wish not to be taught, how could it be so? Gazing toward the mountains and marshes is but an afterthought. Yet those utterly devoid of longing truly leave one disheartened. Now, let it cease.\n\n**On the first day of the twelfth month, at night, the Register of Destinies addressed Lord Xu.**\n\n*(Upon examination, this seems to respond to the matter of his arrival in the capital and inability to come.

They all met one another there. The practices of these several men all surpassed Ying’s. Ying thus became a disciple of Shilong, receiving the Dao of untying the bonds and cultivating the methods of reverse practice. He ingested the Jade Fluid, refined the essence of the brain, and within two or three years, his face radiated luminous splendor, his complexion reverted to youth, and he attained the utmost in Daoist accomplishment. Yet he regretted that his endowment was not abundant, preventing him from achieving the highest rank of transcendence.\n\nThereupon, the Director of Destinies commanded me to recommend him, submitting a memorial to the Upper Palace. His name was transferred to the Registers of the Eastern Direction, and he was appointed an Earthbound Transcendent. At that time, the Left Minister of the Three Offices’ General Prohibition dispatched the Keeper of the Handle, Hou Zhou Fang, and the Envoy of the Unorthodox, Yan Baihu, to the Red Mountain, intending to seize him and take him away, interrogating him regarding his transgressions.

Though this intention was indeed aided by Shi Long of the world, I also admired his bold words.\n\nThereupon, they were granted transcendence and recorded in the Eastern Palace, destined to become middling immortals. Yet within their bodies lingered unresolved karmic debts from past lives, which they would gradually atone for and resolve before the Most High. They were to receive scriptures and official appointments—no longer subject to the trials of the Three Bureaus, their names already fixed in the register of the deathless.\n\nNow they have been relocated to Zhuye Mountain, also called Gaizhu Mountain. On its eastern face, two ridges rise to the west. Between them lies a stone bridge over a well. North of the bridge, a narrow path leads inward. There stand six clusters of cedar trees; within three hundred paces to their left and right is a deep stone chamber. Before it flows a spring, where Ying and three others now dwell.\n\nIn the *chen* year, they will briefly emerge to partake of mortal food and visit their native mountains near their hometowns, allowing their families and brothers to see them. At that time, they will inform their younger brothers of their whereabouts. They also send word to their disciples, urging diligence: if one seeks Ying at Zhuye Mountain, they may yet meet him. Ascend the eastern stone bridge of Zhuye Mountain; north of the bridge, the path is smooth and easy. Do not take the southern route up the mountain, for it is perilously steep.\n\nAmong the immortals of Zhuye Mountain are Chen Zhonglin, Xu Daoju, Yin Linzi, and Zhao Shudao—all of whom entered this mountain at the end of the Han. Shudao has already attained the rank of Lesser Perfected One. Zhonglin has just passed his great trial and will soon depart. These are the elder immortals of Zhuye Mountain.\n\nAs for Wang Shilong, Zhao Daoxuan, Fu Taichu, and Xu Ying (also called Xu Yuanyou), they arrived only four years ago. The record from the twelfth day of the fifth month to this point is based on Yang’s transcription of the imperial decree.\n\nThe venerable ones, resplendent in inner radiance, have cast off their former burdens and are no longer their old selves. Through purification and refinement, they have attained the essence of the Dao. Their spirits harmonize with their hearts, gazing up at the numinous clouds, beholding the dawn’s splendor.

      "translated_text": "The above five entries were transcribed by Director from Yang’s manuscript in two copies.\n\nThe *Scripture of Preserving Life* states: “Master Xu was thus able to entrust his form to the hidden transformation—his nocturnal liberation following Lord Zhang of Zhen’nan. Thereby he nurtured his hun-soul in the Grand Yin, concealed his po-soul within the earth, with the Four Numinous Ones guarding his essence and the Five Elders preserving his store. After sixteen years, he nearly beheld me in the Eastern Flower. Once attaining the hidden and unobstructed, none perceived him as unreal.”\n\n(Master Xu here refers to the Attendant. According to records, Master Zhang served as General Zhen’nan and died in the twenty-first year of Jian’an. Buried east of Ye, forty-four years later—during the fourth year of Ganlu in Wei—his water-sealed coffin opened, revealing a body as if alive. It was lifted onto a bed, whereupon he raised a fly-whisk to cover his face, laughed loudly, and died again, necessitating reburial. External accounts describe the event thus, though the method of nocturnal liberation remains unclear. In Master Xu’s case, it appears not to have involved sword or staff.)\n\nThe above was spoken by Perfected Ying: “From antiquity to the present, life and death possess their ford; the manifest and the hidden meet differently. Concealing the past and extinguishing knowledge—those who align with the world in this—all practice the conduct of Dao attainment. As for those who ride the jade elixir once, make the ninefold blossoms take flight thrice, revel in cloud-liquor at dawn, or wander amidst flowing yellow; who swallow golden nectar and chew jade sprouts—these ascend at once, riding the light into the void, darkly ascending to the Supreme Subtlety. Yet when worldly affairs stray from the mysterious, and this work remains unfinished, one ought to tread the Grand Yin for a time, conceal life in the hidden realm, and cast off the outer form, discarding the bodily husk.”",
      "overlap_context": "n by the Pure Numinous Perfected…” Yang’s text omits these four characters, likely because Yang conveyed it orally to Director—this being Director Pei.)\n\nThis marks the moment of Dao attainment through diligent effort, the time of receiving the scriptures—the initial names determined and set forth. It also signifies the allotted destiny of attaining the Dao and being entrusted with its transmission.\n\nThose who 〈rely〉 and then abandon it will find no path forward.\nWe must together 〈cherish〉 this.",

If the eyes remain undamaged, indistinguishable from a living person, it is likewise *shijie*. If the hair falls out entirely yet the bones lose their form, it is still *shijie*. Those who achieve *shijie* in broad daylight are transcendents, not subject to the usual examples of *shijie*.\n\nThe following entry is transcribed in Jia’s hand:\nIf one temporarily dies and enters the Great Yin, passing provisionally through the Three Bureaus, the flesh may turn to ash and decay, the blood settle, and the pulses disperse—yet the five viscera continue to live. The white bones become jade-like, the seven *po* spirits attend, the three *hun* souls guard the dwelling, the Three Primes suspend their breath, and the great spirit seals itself within.

      "translated_text": "**Initiation into Destiny and Transmission of the Dao, Chapter One**\n\nThe Dao is transmitted.\n\n*(This section was copied by both the Chief Clerk and the Secretary, with the title as given. It is unclear whether this is an ancient Daoist text or a revelation delivered during Yang’s descent. Its principles align perfectly with the true scriptures, and it is suspected to be the teaching of Master Pei. The reason for this is as follows: According to the *Scripture of Treasuring the Spirit*, the Dao states, \"My master is the Red Pine of the Southern Marchmount.\" Moreover, the practices of the bedchamber were only received and cultivated by Master Pei in his youth. The *True Records* contain the words, \"I once regretted that this [understanding] came too late.\" This phrase also seems to echo the speech of the pure and numinous.)*\n\nThe Master said:\nThe Dao is the undifferentiated origin of life. When the origin is perfected, then the Supreme Ultimate arises. The Supreme Ultimate is the parent of Heaven and Earth, the mystery of the Dao. Thus, the Dao has a great return—this is called Pristine Reality. Without the Dao, reality cannot be perfected; without reality, the Dao cannot be fulfilled. If the Dao is not fulfilled, how can its pristine nature be perceived? Therefore, it is called the great return. Perceived, it is called the Wondrous; fulfilled, it is called the Dao; put into practice, it is called nature. Nature and the Dao share the same essence. The essence delights in the perfect Dao, for the Dao causes it to be so.\n\n*(This explains that the human body naturally harmonizes with the Dao. Thus, Heaven’s mandate is called nature; following nature is called the Dao; cultivating the Dao is called teaching. Now, using the Dao to teach and refine nature into reality is to become one with the Dao.)*\n\nThe Master said:\nThe Most High is the descendant of the Dao, who discerns the Dao’s root and penetrates the Dao’s foundation. Thus, they are the Perfected of the Highest Clarity and the teacher of the Old Lord.\n\n*(This refers to the Most High, the August and Numinous, the Great Dao Lord of the Jade Dawn, who is the teacher of the Left Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate and the Central Yellow Old Lord.)*\n\nThe Master said:\nThe Old Lord is the disciple of the Most High. At the age of seven, he grasped the essentials of longevity. Thus, he is the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nThe Master said:\nThe Supreme Ultimate has four Perfected. The Old Lord resides on its left, bearing the talisman of the divine tiger, girded with golden bells, holding the purple-feathered staff, and wearing the headscarf of golden essence. When he travels, he is attended by the canopy of flowering dawn and rides the cloud of the Three Primes.\n\n*(These two passages are drawn from the *Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, discussing the Central Yellow Old Lord. The Yellow Old Lord is the teacher of the Perfected of the Grand Void and the Red Lord of the Southern Marchmount.

Weidao’s countenance showed no change, his heart was at ease, and his body at peace as he lay beneath it for twelve years. The immortal tested him repeatedly, sparing no trial, yet Weidao awakened to them all. Thereupon, he was bestowed with divine elixir and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. (This man likely lived in the Han era.)\n\nThe Master said:\nLong ago, there was Lord Green Crow, who received the teachings of an enlightened master and thoroughly grasped the wondrous principles of immortality. He entered the Hua Mountains to study the Dao and spent four hundred seventy-one years there. Though he underwent the twelve trials, three remained unpassed.

The two younger brothers set aside their scrolls to watch it, but the eldest, Zhou Jun, never ceased his recitation.

Zhou Jun recited the scripture ten thousand times, while his brothers completed nine thousand seven hundred and thirty-three.

Fortunately, he awakened swiftly and preserved the visualization of the Seven Stars of the Supreme One to repel it, thereby escaping harm. Later, he was again deluded by malevolent spirits, losing his left eye. Thus, he failed to attain the Dao and perished in the mountains.

Then, pure tones softly resound, and harmonious winds arise in unison. The twin luminaries shine with radiance, and the clouds of dawn await no invitation. They cradle the sprouting of the uncarved, blocking the myriad sources at the loom’s outset. All life returns to the true, and every kindred spirit conceals its beginnings.

Gazing upward at the misty qi, one sees the numinous clouds coiling through the void. Looking down upon the Six Pitches, one perceives the Eight Winds fanning their might. The Great Void emits the howl of the hidden depths, and the circular luminaries cast their radiance upon the empty sky. Then, purple mists gather in beauty, waves surge against crumbling peaks, floating vapors shape the landscape, and the clear light flees in flight. The Five Phases engage in mutual destruction, the Four Seasons clash and cast aside. Metal and Earth draw close, while Water and Fire form enmity. Forests and grasses halt their growth, and the hundred rivers open and close. Thunderous lightning rages and boils, thunder shakes east and west, splitting and shattering. Heaven is in turmoil—this is the calamity of the Yang Ninth. Earth is obstructed—this is the convergence of the Hundred Sixth.

The August Thearch bestows the purple leaps of exalted joy, the Supreme Perfected grants the fiery bells of flowing gold. Divine youths open the carriage shafts as the Nine Phoenixes cry in unison. Heavenly pipes startle the void, morning bells chime in scattered resonance. Raising the body and lowering the banner, the Eight Effulgences float in the sky. Dragon carriages and tiger banners fan out across the eight directions, ascending to the utmost tips of Eternal Yang, descending to repose in the orchid halls of inverted shadows. Moon consorts harness their teams of four, sunlight illumines the visage; spirit maidens embrace the quilts as incense smoke overflows the windows. A glance and a turn—how the circular net strides beyond! What need to speak of the ninety thousand li?

      "translated_text": "Consuming it as food renders the spirit supple and pervasive, bestowing radiance and lightness. Taking it in pills or powders dispels the hundred diseases, and the five viscera brim with fluid—thus vision endures long and grows ever clearer. The ancients called it the \"crimson essence of mountain spirits\" and the \"quintessence of *Alpinia*.\" The *Tai Shang Daoist Inscription on Immortality* states: *\"If you desire long life, consume the mountain essence. If you desire to soar lightly, consume the mountain ginger.\"* Such is its meaning.\n\nI do not claim that all other substances should be reduced in favor of *Atractylodes* for benefit. Yet the efficacy of *Atractylodes* qi is precisely what this age requires. In this latter age, illness abounds—it is fitting to take and employ it. Though the Dao may be inwardly sufficient, one still fears the calamities of external affairs. Even when the form is outwardly replete, there may yet be the flaw of inner collapse. The extremes of Zhang and Shan serve as warning enough.\n\n*Atractylodes* can grant long life and enduring longevity, and secondly, it can repel the myriad afflictions of malevolent demons. I have seen recluses in the mountains and forests who, having mastered this Way, live for eight hundred or a thousand years, standing shoulder to shoulder with the Five Peaks. Yet people, burdened by excessive writing, cannot even record one or two methods to demonstrate it.\n\nNow I compile several formulas for taking *Atractylodes* to enlighten those who cherish secrecy. If one truly believes and employs them, they may avert sudden and violent disasters. When great peace arrives, the four directions will harmonize, the celestial weave will nurture life, calamitous fumes will vanish, the five poisons will conceal their forms, the two luminaries will ever watch over, and the myriad things will flourish of themselves. At such a time, you may act as you will—no more will there be untimely ruin.\n\nWhat I have spoken of *Atractylodes* is meant to urge those with intent to take and use it, thereby averting these disasters and ailments.\n\nOf late, however, lesser scholars have vied with one another in confusion, often employing indiscriminate concoctions and the methods of the *Yellow Writ* and *Red Realm*. These indeed contain the true essentials of harmonizing the two complementary forces of life. If one unites in the Dao, breaks free from the snares of the world, aligns with the six directions, follows the seasonal nodes, averts disasters, dispels misfortunes, congeals essence, and treasures the embryo—above, the spirits of the brain will not wane; below, the three fields will overflow. Advancing and retreating in proper measure, calamities will be dispelled; warp and weft will align, and health will endure. Enemies will grasp the reins without faltering, and the six armies will march far and return whole—such are its benefits. Yet this is not the grandest affair of the immortals’ tradition.\n\nAlas, how perilous! Though these are arts of mutual generation and methods of transcendence, they resemble driving an ice chariot through the fiery regions or sailing a fire boat upon drowning waters. Without true rectitude, failure is all but certain.",

Whether from wind-cold binding the Passes or flowing swellings and chronic afflictions, misfortunes have assailed without warning, and illnesses have arisen beyond expectation—day by day, they gather in throngs.\n\nNow, *Atractylodes* qi checks demonic fluids, exhaled smoke subdues and breaks the joints of evil.

      "translated_text": "Some may defy celestial patterns, harbor slanderous malice and envy, causing the spiritual root to stagnate and block, the cycles of fortune and misfortune to diverge. They violate sacred vows and offend the luminous, incurring the wrath of the Three Officials. Or they provoke enmity and chain disasters, leading royal armies to defeat. Or they bury captives alive and slaughter the surrendered, soaking the fields with blood. Or they exhaust their horses’ strength yet still press onward—if they then plunge deep into the northern frontier without resistance, will they not surely perish beneath the Xiongnu blades? Their bodies will die abroad, their families be executed at home. How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?\n\nI have witnessed many such cases—few gain benefit, only vain strivings for survival, sighing endlessly over the cycle of rebirth. How much better to guard the cinnabar truth within the Crimson Palace, summon the primordial spirit to the Mud Pill, preserve the vital fluids without loss, seal the hidden arts at the Gate of Destiny, ingest sacred herbs to nurture life, rinse the mouth with flower-streams in clear rivers, study the profound and wondrous secret formulas, and recite the hidden chapters of the Most High. Then one may dwell high among the peaks and ridges, reckoning time alongside gold and stone. What lord could claim such a one as friend? What emperor could make them a subject? Far from the Five Turbidities of the dusty world, ever in purity awaiting the true.

From birth to old age, from old age to sickness, guarding the body until death—its sufferings are boundless. The vexations of the heart and the accumulation of sins perpetuate the cycle of birth and death, its bitterness beyond words. How much more so for those who fail to live out their natural span?\n\nTo pursue the Dao is bitter: maintaining purity to preserve the true, guarding the mysterious to contemplate the numinous, seeking teachers through hardship, enduring hundreds of trials, diligently keeping the mind from lapsing, resolutely focusing the will—this is the utmost bitterness. To regard the rank of lords as transient, gold and jade as mere bricks and stones, and fine silks as rags—only then can one be said to truly inquire into the Dao.\"\n\nThe Azure Lad of the Directions further states: \"One who cultivates the Dao and severs the roots of love and desire is like a hand grasping a string of pearls—one by one, they will eventually be exhausted. Gradually removing external evils will also reach an end. When all is exhausted, the Dao is attained.\"",

Those who study the jade-classic treasured scriptures shall surely achieve immortality. As for those who stand at my left side, their intentions incline toward perverse conduct; they shall never attain the Dao.\n\nWhen one pursues the Dao—reading the Daoist scriptures and performing Daoist deeds—it is like tasting honey: the entire mouth is sweet, the six viscera are delighted, and a lingering savor remains. Those who can act thus shall attain the Dao. *(The Supreme Minister has no descending Yang matters; this refers only to absorbing the radiance of the sun and moon.)*\n\nThe Perfected of Great Emptiness, the Red Lord of South Mountain, declared: “When a person commits many evils yet does not repent, suddenly restraining their heart, their sins return to them as rivers flow to the sea, daily growing deeper and wider. But if one recognizes their wrongs, repents, and turns to goodness, their sins vanish and virtue accumulates—thus may they attain the Dao.\n\nWhen others bring misfortune upon you, meet it with blessing. Thus, the qi of fortune and virtue ever arises from this. The qi of harm and heavy calamity returns instead to them. This is the conduct of one who studies the Dao.”\n\nHe further declared: “When the wicked harm the worthy, it is like spitting toward the sky—the spittle does not [reach] the sky but returns to [strike] oneself. *(All instances of ‘刑’ should be ‘形’.)* To cast dust against the wind is to have it not [reach] the other but instead drench one’s own body.

      "translated_text": "The Red Lord also had no further separate instructions to impart.\n\nThe Lady of Purple Prime declared: “There are five difficulties in the world. The first is that poverty makes bestowing alms difficult. The second is that great wealth makes studying the Dao difficult. The third is that controlling one’s fate to avoid death is difficult. The fourth is that obtaining and beholding the Cavernous Scriptures is difficult. The fifth is that being born in the sagely age after the *ren-chen* cycle is difficult.\n\nLong ago, I asked the Most High: ‘By what means may one come to know one’s past lives?’ The Most High replied: ‘The Dao and virtue are formless; knowing them brings no benefit. What is essential is to guard one’s resolve and practice the Dao. It is like polishing a mirror—once the grime is removed, clarity remains, and one’s own form becomes visible. Sever the six passions, guard emptiness and purity, and you will both perceive the truth of the Dao and know your past lives.’\n\nHe further said: ‘Contemplate the Dao, practice the Dao, and have faith in the Dao, and you will attain the root of faith. Its blessings are measureless.’\n\nThe Lady of Purple Tenuity declared: “One who practices the Dao is like one who carries fire into a dark room—the darkness vanishes, and only light remains. When one who studies the Dao preserves correctness, ignorance is extinguished, and correctness alone endures. Wealth and sensual pleasure in relation to oneself are like a small child coveting the honey on a blade’s edge—its sweetness is insufficient to delight the mouth, yet it brings the peril of a severed tongue.”\n\nThe Lady of Mystic Clarity declared: “The entanglements of a man with wife, children, and treasured home are more grievous than imprisonment in shackles. Imprisonment in shackles may yet be pardoned, but the passions of wife and children—even when they bring calamity as dire as a tiger’s maw—one still willingly casts oneself into them. Such transgressions admit no pardon. Emotional attachments ensnare a person as surely as one who grasps a torch and walks against the wind. The fool who does not release the torch will surely burn his hand. The poisons of greed, anger, and ignorance dwell within the human body. If one does not swiftly remove this disaster through the Dao, peril is certain. This is what it means for the ignorant to burn their hands.\n\nOne who practices the Dao is like wood upon the water, following the current as it flows. It neither strikes the left bank nor the right bank. It is not seized by men, nor is it obstructed by ghosts and spirits. Nor does it rot and decay. I guarantee it will reach the sea. When a person practices the Dao, is not deluded by filthy desires, is not deceived by manifold evils, and advances with unflagging resolve and no doubt, I guarantee they will attain the Dao.”\n\nThe Lady of the Southern Culmen said: “From love arises sorrow; when sorrow arises, fear follows. Without love, there is no sorrow; without sorrow, there is no fear. Once there was a man who recited scriptures late into the night with such grief that his emotions were deeply stirred, and suddenly he was overcome with longing for home. The Perfected of the Most High then appeared in the guise of an ordinary man and went directly to ask him: ‘Have you ever played the zither?’ The man replied: ‘When I was at home, I used to play it.’ The Perfected said: ‘What is it like when the strings are slack?’ The man replied: ‘They do not sound, nor do they evoke sorrow.’ The Perfected asked again: ‘What is it like when the strings are too taut?’ The man replied: ‘The sound breaks, and it becomes mournful.’ The Perfected asked once more: ‘What is it like when slackness and tension are balanced?’ The man replied: ‘All notes harmonize, and the eight tones resound in wondrous concert.’ The Perfected said: ‘Studying the Dao is the same. When the mind is properly attuned, it is like playing the zither—the Dao may be attained.’\n\nOf all great desires, none is greater than sensual pleasure. Its transgressions know no bounds, and its consequences admit no pardon. Were it to have even one more counterpart, not a single person under heaven could practice the Dao.\n\nThose who study the Dao—no act of hidden virtue is greater than bestowing kindness and delivering salvation, and no resolve is greater than guarding the body and serving the Dao. Their blessings are vast, and their lives are firmly established. If someone bears ill will toward me, I do not accept it; the ill will returns to its source. Disaster will return to their body as surely as a shadow follows form and an echo follows sound.”\n\nThe above are the teachings and admonitions of the assembled numinous beings.

Lose life, and the four images also perish. It is not that the four images perish, but that the perishing of life destroys them.

Enduring life can even generate that which casts no shadow—what need to reckon with the four images?\n\nDisaster strikes, calamity arises, form decays, qi scatters—what manner of affair is this? It seems to arise from much speech without holding to the One, from many schemes seeking mere escape. Thus the lofty nest collapses and its branches fall; a hundred victories are lost in a single defeat.

Those who wielded cunning gave rise to the calamity of drifting and dissipation; those who coveted and sought brought upon themselves the burden of self-aggrandizement.

Human sentiment is ever thus moved—weeping and mourning are but the sorrow of parting, the rites of hastening to the bier. Internally, they express emotion; externally, they accord with ritual. This is what the worthy and the common alike uphold, and none may transgress it. Though I, Mu, inwardly cultivate the Dao, outwardly I remain bound to the customs of the world. I have not yet cast off my robes to dwell in the mountains, nor girded myself with rope to wander alone. Thus I cannot but follow the rites that harmonize emotion and propriety, aligning inner and outer in perfect accord. Should I one day violate this, not only would I fail to bear the weight of affection, but I would also fear the harm that would befall me.\n\nYour words, my lady, are tender and attuned to feeling, yet vast in their guidance of the Dao and enduring in their instruction—truly far-reaching. I shall humbly heed your admonitions, ensuring that sorrow does not turn to harm, that weeping does not exceed restraint. I will dwell in the Dao as I please, without daring to transgress.

My luminous guidance shines forth in the eight directions of clarity. I yield to the numinous root, treasuring and refining the three measures. Nurturing the fluids and harmonizing the hun-soul, even should a rushing wind howl and rage, it could not assail my true nature. Though a tempestuous gale may surge and darken, how could it disturb my pure and unadulterated essence?\n\nThus I empty myself and chant in stillness, with a void heart awaiting the gods. I tend and gather the hundred absences, dwelling in the utmost truth. Let no cares or burdens intrude upon the mysterious abode; let no sorrowful thoughts disturb the crimson ford. In serene detachment and distant contemplation, I rejoice in the shared radiance of light. Then the supreme joy naturally resounds in both ears, like jade chimes ringing in the empty pavilion.

Now, the Hua family—father and son—are being examined by the Water Bureau. Hua Qiao’s deviation from the Dao stems from Hua Qi’s flattery and disorder, which corrupted his resolve. As for Hua Tuan and Hua Xigu, the Three Bureaus used them for testing, but the trial proved unsuccessful. Thus, Qiao was sentenced to death, his name promptly stricken from the registers and his scalp delivered to the Water Bureau. Secretly inquire whether anyone in his household bears this name—and if so, who it is. *(The preceding all responds to inquiries about the Hua family’s affairs, though it remains unclear whether this refers to the Year of the Ox or the Year of the Rat.)*\n\nXu Chao brutally murdered Zhang Huan, the Merit Officer of Xinye Commandery, and wrongfully demanded a dragon-horse. These men all await opportune moments to act, having already reported to the Water Bureau. The Bureau has pressured Xu Dou to restore his ancestral tombs and observe his household, seeking the son of the declining line to appease the accusers. The appointed day of his death falls on the lost day of the lost month—by then, his retribution shall arrive.

On the thirteenth day of the sixth month, the Lesser Mao Lord temporarily assumed the form of a jade axe and appeared in a dream to Hu Ya, commanding the couple to clearly deliver these four kinds of offerings in recompense to the four marshals who had captured ghosts. Why do you no longer recall this so that I may ask you further? *(My question means: \"Let us both be attentive.\" It was not that these four ghost marshals were originally Daoist libationers, who, having mastered the arts of release from below, received scriptures and became ghost marshals.)*\n\nSince there were recompenses in the form of deceptive pledges, they would long serve one’s own purposes with diligence. The reason for appearing in a dream in the form of a jade axe was that Hu Ya’s hun and po had yet to connect with the perfected immortals. The jade axe is pure, bright, and cleansing; after prolonged fasting and purification of the po, the heart draws near to the immortals, thus borrowing its image to communicate through dreams. Though the dream was communicated, if one still fails to awaken, it may be said that faith is not sincere. Or if one awakens yet forgets the pledges, it may be said that sincerity lacks reflection.\n\nAs for deceptive vows, all receive their mandates in secret exchange—one must be cautious not to let others know. The outer scripture says: *\"I have heard the mandate; it cannot be shown to others.\"* *(The \"Yang Zhi Shui\" chapter of the Mao Odes states: \"I have heard the mandate; it cannot be told to others.\" This refers precisely to such matters.)*\n\nThe night of the thirtieth day of the sixth month.",

Yufu, defiled by corpse impurity and tainted flesh, has received the sagely compassion of deliverance. Each edict of admonition bestowed is a profound grace upon his descendants. He constantly looks up in reverence to the numinous beneficence, forever relying on the celestial {vast shade}.\n\nYufu, with his dull and stubborn inferiority, is by nature difficult to instruct. Though he strives day and night, he remains plagued by transgressions and faults. This night, in a dream, he awakened to this realization. Reflecting on this, all is Yufu’s own culpability. Overwhelmed by shame and dread, he has no ground to stand upon.\n\nThe numinous Dao is lofty and empty; a man of flesh cannot yet grasp the true Dharma. He can only hold fast to sincerity and reverence, cultivating the precious mysteries. Yet he fears the numinous decree is too profound, the admonitions too subtle. Yufu, dull and benighted, cannot fully comprehend. Such sins accumulate day by day, and his violations of the precepts and commandments number in the thousands and tens of thousands.\n\nIf the Divine Mother, in her benevolence, would deign to pardon and absolve him once more, then today his anxiety and distress would be profound, his liver and gall shattered. He can only {break} his bones in remorse for his faults, though it does nothing to amend past wrongs. To repeatedly submit petitions and cause such trouble is unseemly, and his shame and fear compound.\n\nYufu pledges his sincerity and begs to swear an oath. From this day forward, he will purify his heart and renew his devotion, making covenant before Heaven and Earth. He will guard his form in stillness and follow the teachings with discipline. He begs for the pardon of his father Mu, his elder brother Huya, and all their transgressions, great and small. If Yufu has failed in his duties, he begs to bear the punishment himself. May all, great and small, be absolved.\n\nIf the Divine Mother would show mercy and permit Yufu to reflect on his faults and amend his errors, then his entire household, in perfect unity, would receive her grace. Thus, they would forever behold the Three Luminaries and be granted life anew.\n\nRespectfully submitted.",

This year, the ancestral spirits of the Xu clan have stirred in minor disturbances, yet no great suffering has arisen.

There is no cause for worry.\n\nThe juncture of departure or stay, the matter of life and death—these are secrets guarded by the Three Offices, not to be revealed to outsiders. That I speak of them now is only because you have already embraced the Supreme Dao within your heart-mind. For now, you may retain your official post; it is not yet time to resign. Whether to leave or remain—we shall deliberate further when the moment comes.\n\nThis was relayed by Zhonghou of the Right Division last night, and so I write it down to share with you.\n\nWhen a household encounters illness, death, decline, or misfortune—when strange lights appear, dreams trouble the mind, or wealth dwindles—these may be averted through rites of exorcism. Yet the most urgent matter is to resolve disputes over graves and ancestral curses. If these remain unresolved, calamity will persist without end.\n\nThis is the reply from Baoming to Attendant Xu.\n\n*True Instructions, Scroll Seven*\n*True Instructions, Scroll Eight*\n*Transmission of the Destined Mandate, Fourth Chapter*\n\nThe wanderings of spirits and the illusions of the unseen may not be trusted, yet excessive toil, excessive affairs, excessive thoughts, and excessive distractions wear down the spirit, scatter the true self, and disturb the Three Passes, thereby harming one’s luminous virtue. Thus, for those like Master Xu, to contain the inner radiance and restrain the four excesses, to refine emptiness and infuse the numinous—only then may immortality be hoped for. The Register of Fixed Destiny declares:\n\nPurify your bed and its surroundings, keep them clean and serene. Arrange your clothing and bedding with care, assigning a constant attendant.

Composed by the Lady of Purple Tenuity: \"Fortune and Harmony shall bear two sons, their abundant virtue destined for the age.\" *(Fortune and Harmony seems to have been the humble childhood name of Lady Li; in the *Book of Jin*, she is called Junrong. The two sons are Emperor Xiaowu and his younger brother, Daoji.)*\n\nThat same night, the Mid-Candidate spoke again:\n*(The following three entries are in Yang’s hand, later transcribed by an aide.)*\n\n\"Since the virtuous artisan has already concentrated his spirit and the profound model descends from Heaven, matters of safety or peril ought not yet be inquired into. The lord’s devotion is most earnest; that I have not yet reciprocated is because foreknowledge of events is difficult to discuss.\"\n\nOf late, the celestial *qi* has surged wildly, and the shadows of yin have shifted repeatedly. Venus has sundered its form between the two celestial markers, its turbulence seething beneath the Purple Chamber. The king detests this; the Son of Heaven has cause for concern. The seat of the Grand Minister stirs. Now I offer a cryptic verse in secret counsel:\n*(The following passage and the cryptogram were transcribed by an aide, appended to his own record of revisions on the same sheet. The original text is woven in a circular pattern, making it difficult to decipher.

This is called \"the qi of mountains and rivers flowing freely, ever full and never depleted.\" First, rub the palms together until hot, then wipe both eyes.

Repeat this three or four times to harmonize the essence, circulate the blood, and prevent wind-qi from entering. With long practice, one will neither die nor fall ill.

If practiced constantly, the hair will not fall but instead grow daily. Frequently change combs, combing often but without causing pain. One may also have an attendant comb the hair thoroughly. Thus, blood and fluids will not stagnate, and the roots of the hair will remain firm.\n\nThe above was taught by An Jiuhua for practical use.\n*(These two passages concern halting graying and preventing hair loss, and were also given in answer to the Prefect.)*\n\nLady Ziwei further instructed:\n\"Beneath the canopy of blossoming splendor, extend harmony to the celestial perfected.\nEnter the valley of mountain streams, fill the source of the celestial mountain.\nThen the numinous and ethereal become visible, and the myriad ghosts destroy themselves.\nThis is what is meant by ‘looking up to harmonize with the celestial perfected, looking down to press the mountain source.’\"\n*(The blossoming canopy is also called the blossoming court.)*\n\nThe celestial perfected is between the two eyebrows, at the corners of the brows. The mountain source is the base of the philtrum beneath the nose, slightly recessed into the valley. The blossoming court lies below the two eyebrows—it is the thoroughfare of penetrating vision. The celestial perfected is the upper chamber for drawing in the numinous. At dawn, noon, and dusk, constantly swallow saliva twenty-seven times, and urgently press with the fingers twenty-seven times in the yin manner as a regular practice. This will enable one to attain numinous clarity of vision and block the path of the myriad evils. Perform this thrice daily.\n*(Lady Ziwei said: When a person suddenly falls ill and is near death, worldly physicians only know to needle the philtrum, unaware of needling the valley of the mountain source—this is a grave error. The original annotation begins here, as Yang appended it to the Prefect’s letter.)*\n\nPress while reciting:\n\"Open and clear the celestial court,\nLet me attain long life.\nPenetrate vision for ten thousand miles,\nLet soul and spirit return to infancy.\nDestroy ghosts and repel demons,\nSummon a thousand numinous beings.\nAscend to the Supreme,\nMerge with the sun.\nObtain the rank of perfected person,\nInscribed in the register of the mysterious.\n[As in the time of Duke Zhuang of Chu.]\"",

      "translated_text": "(This refers to King Zhuang of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period.) Market chief Song Laizi constantly swept the entire marketplace. After a long time, a beggar appeared, wandering the market to beg for food day after day. He would often chant:\n\n*\"The celestial court blooms with twin flowers,\nThe mountain source reveals yin’s evil.\nAt dawn, press the heavenly steed,\nCome to the abode of the Supreme Perfected.\nThe perfected person cannot hide,\nThus vanquishing the hundred demons.\"*\n\nSong Laizi chanted this while begging, yet none in the market understood his song. Only Laizi suddenly realized the beggar might be an immortal, though he still did not grasp the meaning of the verses. He then became the beggar’s disciple, abandoning his post to follow him. After thirteen years, the beggar transmitted to him the Dao of the Middle Immortals. Laizi now resides on Central Marchmount.\n\nThe beggar was Feng Yanshou, a Perfected One of Western Marchmount and a court historian during the reign of King Xuan of Zhou. The \"heavenly steed\" refers to the hands, and the \"mountain source\" to the area beneath the nose. Written on the night of the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month. *(Yang Jie concludes his transcription here.)*\n\nLady Yunlin Wang said: The Dao of the immortals and perfected ones takes the ears and eyes as its foundation.

      "translated_text": "Only those who fail to practice it find the practice difficult. To achieve supreme clarity and luminous perception, and to observe spirits and deities at will, one must purify the heart and sever all distracting thoughts, abandoning dissipation and excess. This is called \"strictness at the outset.\"\n\nAt night before sleep, first tightly close the eyes and face east. With the base of each thumb, press and wipe from the eyes toward the ears, so that both palms meet at the nape of the neck—perform this twenty-seven times. Visualize three colored qi—purple, azure, and crimson—emerging before the eyes. This is the inner pressing of the Three Primordial Clouds, which irrigates and unites the Celestial Lads.\n\nRecite the following incantation in silence:\n*\"Celestial Lads of the Three Clouds,\nTrue Lords of the Two Eyes,\nRadiant and luminous, you infuse essence,\nOpening and clearing the spirit.\nGreat Mystery’s cloudy forms,\nSpiritual steeds soaring lightly—\nGuard and benefit the twin gates,\nUnseal and penetrate the nine portals.\nA hundred joints respond in resonance,\nMorning fluid ascends to the Mud-Pill Palace.\nThe body ascends to the Jade Court,\nRanked among the Supreme Perfected.\"*\n\nThese forty-eight characters recited, swallow saliva fifty times, then open the eyes. This may be practiced as a regular routine, whether sitting or rising, not limited to night. If performed at the hour of birth for about a year, the ears and eyes will grow keen and bright. With prolonged practice, one may see clearly for a thousand miles, perceive spirits and deities, and hear sounds beyond ordinary reach. This is indeed a lofty Dao of the true immortals—not merely for brightening the eyes and opening the ears.\n\nThose who aspire to study the Dao should strive to keep their practices and perceptions unknown to others in all matters. As the song in the Supreme Palace of the Most High declares:\n*\"Hands grasp the qi of the Eight Clouds,\nRadiance guards the Two Lads.\nThe Supreme Perfected holds the bright mirror,\nIts reflection unites the edge of sun and moon.\nCloudy forms brush the high gates,\nOpening the Mud-Pill Palace.\nTen thousand sounds enter a hundred passages,\nThe Proud Maiden sits in the Dark Chamber.\nThe more one practices, the more vibrant and flourishing—\nThe numinous power naturally flows through.\"*",

Adjust the temperature and bathe the body, and all filth will be dispelled. This not only removes impurity but also prevents damp impediment, sores, and itching. Bamboo is hollow, plain, and internally white, while peach repels evil and breaks filth—thus these two substances are used to purge the turbidity within the body. When celestial beings descend to wander the earth and return, they invariably use this water to cleanse themselves.

Then softly intone:\n\n*\"Great Cavern of the True and Mysterious,\nRefine and forge the Three Hun Souls:\nThe First Hun swiftly guards the Seven Po,\nThe Second Hun swiftly guards the Mud-Pill Palace,\nThe Third Hun receives the heart’s command.\nSwiftly invoke the Supreme Lords of the Three Origins.\nI have encountered an inauspicious dream—\nThe Seven Po and the wandering corpse\nHave conspired with the source of myriad evils.\nHasten to summon Peach-Kang, Guardian of Life,\nTo report above to the Imperial Lord.\nThe Five Elders and Nine Perfected\nAll stand guard at the gates of the body.\nThe Yellow Chamber’s Divine Masters,\nThe Purple Gate Generals,\nWielding halberds and shaking bells,\nDispel and extinguish the malign influences.\nTurn misfortune to fortune,\nSevering all ties to life and death.\"*\n\nConclude. If you lie down again, you will assuredly receive an auspicious response. As for the baleful *qi* of ill dreams, it will be sealed beneath the Three Passes. After three years, only spiritually resonant dreams will manifest, and all dreams will become clear reflections of future events, utterly free from inauspicious omens or ill portents.\n\n*(The character for \"evil\" [恶] as written by the Chief Scribe places* xin *beneath* you*. Its meaning is akin to* xin *beneath* xi*, signifying the harsh and malevolent heart of Metal in the West.)*\n\nIf you encounter an auspicious dream in the night—a good dream that your heart deems favorable—this is a sign of blessed resonance. Upon awakening, rub your eyes thirty-four times and gnash your teeth thirty-four times. Then softly intone:\n\n*\"Supreme High Essence,\nThree Emperors of Cinnabar Spirit,\nThe Crimson Palace shines with clarity,\nBlessed resonance conveys its message.\nThe Three Origins’ gentle *po* souls,\nThe Heavenly Sovereign bestows the scriptures.\nAll endeavors harmonize,\nAscending as flying immortals to the Upper Clarity,\nEver in the company of Jade Perfected,\nTogether assembling in the Purple Court.\"*\n\nConclude.

He dispatched envoys—Zhang Qian, the Feathered Forest Captain Qin Jing, Academician Wang Zun, and eleven others—to the Great Yuezhi Kingdom to procure and transcribe the *Forty-Two Chapters of the Buddha’s Sutra*, which were later stored in the fourteenth chamber of the Orchid Terrace’s stone repository. At once, he ordered a Buddhist temple built north of the road outside the western gate of Luoyang. He also commissioned a Buddha statue and a depiction of Hariti at the Cool Terrace of the Southern Palace. The Emperor was deeply moved, and even before constructing his own mausoleum, he had a Buddha image installed in the palace hall. At that time, the realm prospered and the people lived in peace; distant barbarians, admiring the transformation, willingly submitted as vassals.

      "translated_text": "Now, desiring to speak of the various minor *fangzhu* where the Buddha is revered, it is fitting first to recount these matters.\n\nAccording to records, the Zhang Qian mentioned here was not the one from the Former Han—perhaps only their names coincided. Fu Yi, styled Zhongwu, is attested in the *Book of Han*. The Qin princes Jing and Zun are obscure. This temple is called the White Horse Temple. Emperor Ming was later interred at the Mausoleum of Manifest Virtue; what is called here the \"Longevity Mausoleum\" refers to the practice of Han emperors, who, while still reigning, prepared their tombs in advance—much as people today construct their own burial mounds—rather than naming an actual mausoleum. External records also state that the court dispatched Attendant Gentleman Zhang Kan (or, as some say, Gentleman of the Palace Zhang [Xin]) to Tianzhu to copy and bring back scriptures and images, along with śramaṇas. Yet even this account may not reflect the true transmission, for it likely derives from the old notes of Master Yang. Nevertheless, in the authentic scriptures and pronouncements, references to Buddhist matters appear frequently.\n\nThe *fangzhu* are aligned with the four directions, hence their name. Each face measures one thousand three hundred *li*, and the four faces together span five thousand two hundred *li*. Its height reaches nine thousand *zhang*. There stands the Ever-Bright Mount Tai, and the Moonlit Mound, each encircling four hundred *li*. The minor mountains and rivers resemble those of our world, yet their grasses and trees flourish more luxuriantly, and their blossoms and fruits are more resplendent. The herb of immortality abounds, as do springs of sweet water; those who partake of them do not die.\n\nThe Palace of the Azure Lord is situated atop the Eastern Florescence Mountain, covering two hundred *li* in extent—entirely the abode of celestial immortals and highest perfected beings. Its halls and chambers are wrought of gold, jade, and luminous jasper. There is also the Dark and Frigid Mountain, upon which stands a separate outer palace, its structures spanning two hundred *li*. To the east and west of the great *fangzhu* lie smaller *fangzhu*, each three thousand *li* distant. These minor *fangzhu* also measure three hundred *li* on each side, encircling one thousand two hundred *li*, and each possesses its own Palace of the Azure Lord.\n\nMoreover, they teem with middle-ranking immortals, numinous birds, and sacred beasts. The great *fangzhu* lies opposite the southeast of Kuaiji, yet from the shore of Kuaiji it appears seventy thousand *li* away. Gazing northeast, one sees the Scalding Vale and the Land of the Fusang Tree, which are another sixty thousand *li* distant from the *fangzhu*. (The *fangzhu* is the *yi* region, the Scalding Vale the *jia* region; thus from *yin* to *chen* spans ten thousand *li*. The five corners and seven directions are spoken of in terms of diagonal angles, totaling fourteen thousand *li*—hence the seventy thousand *li* from Kuaiji.)\n\nTo the west of the great *fangzhu*, atop the minor *fangzhu*, many follow the Dao of the Buddha.",

      "translated_text": "Amidst these lands stand pagodas, intricately carved from gold and jade. Some rise a hundred *zhang* in height, their towers numbering in the dozens. Those who dwell above are all filial and deathless, for they partake of the deathless herb. They ingest the essence of the Five Stars and study the *Xia Gui Zang Jing*, employing its methods to traverse the skies. (Note: The *Xia* canon is called *Lian Shan*, the *Yin* canon *Gui Zang*—this differs from the present text. Though they follow the Buddha’s Way, they do not adopt the form or robes of *bhikṣus*. The world calls them the true household of bodhisattvas.)\n\nTo the east of the great *fangzhu*, atop the minor *fangzhu*, lie many rare and numinous treasures. There is white jade wine infused with golden nectar, and the Azure Lord stores celestial treasures here in abundance. Many immortals also dwell here, partaking of the deathless herb and drinking this wine. Their bodies take on the luster of gold and jade. They often play the Nine Numinous Flutes for their own delight. The sound of the flute carries forty *li*, its thirty holes carved into bamboo two or three *chi* long. When the nine flutes play in unison, the hundred beasts dance, and dozens of phoenixes arrive to harmonize with the melody.\n\nThe Palace of the Great *Fangzhu* is the Azure Lord’s constant abode. Those who dwell above are celestial perfected ones and lofty immortals, where the lords of the Grand Ultimate, the ducal ministers, and the various Directors of Destinies reside. Some practice the method of ingesting the rays of the sun and moon. Though they have already attained the Dao and become perfected, they continue this practice. (Mount Huo and Red City are also bureaus of the Directors of Destinies. Only the Grand Prime Perfected, the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, resides there. Li Zhongfu is in the West, Han Zhong in the South, and the remaining thirty-one Directors of Destinies are all in the Eastern Flower Capital. The Azure Lad serves as the Grand Director of Destinies, overseeing all. Master Yang also states: the Eastern Dipper’s attendant—it is unclear which rank he holds.)\n\nDirect your attention inward and visualize a symbol within the heart, as large as a coin, glowing red. Then visualize the sun with nine rays rising from the heart, ascending through the throat to the teeth, where the rays linger before returning to the stomach. After a long while, with eyes closed, clearly perceive the heart and stomach, then exhale and rinse the mouth with saliva thirty-nine times before stopping. Perform this thrice daily. After a year of practice, illnesses will vanish. After five years, the body will radiate light. After eighteen years, one will surely attain the Dao, casting no shadow at noon, repelling a hundred ghosts and a thousand malign influences. Constantly visualize the sun within the heart and the moon within the Mud Pill Palace. At night, ingest the moon’s essence as you do the sun’s. Visualize the moon’s ten white rays descending from the brain into the throat, where the rays do not pass the teeth but return to the stomach.\n\nThis is the method of the perfected ones of *Fangzhu*, recorded in the *Sutra of Great Wisdom*, upper and middle chapters. Those who practice it steadfastly will witness the Great Peace. (This likely corresponds to the seventh section of the *Seven Chapters of Wisdom for Dispelling Demons*.)\n\nThe above was imparted by the Lady of the Southern Culmen. Practicing the Way of the sun in the heart and the moon in the Mud Pill Palace is said to be simple and easily grasped. Those who persist without interruption will expel the Three Corpses from the body, cure a hundred illnesses and a thousand afflictions, and master the Way of refining the hun and restraining the po. When the sun and moon perpetually illuminate the body, ghosts will have no place to hide. The Azure Lord still practices this method. I am one such practitioner and now reveal it to you. You may discreetly share it with those of sincere intent.\n\nPracticing this Way does not hinder the methods of ingesting the sun and moon as prescribed in the precious scriptures; combining them is even better. Immortals accomplish a thousand tasks in a single day and night without feeling weary. How diligently they cultivate the Dao! Life must not be squandered.\n\n(The \"precious scriptures’ sun and moon\" refer to those used in the Purple Texts.)\n\nThe above was imparted by the Lord of Western City. (This was also told to Master Yang, who was instructed to share it with the various Xu.)\n\nTo pursue the Dao is like shooting an arrow: one must aim straight and not waver to hit the target. Enter the mountains with unwavering resolve, and you will attain the true Perfection.\n\nSo instructed the Mysterious Clarity. (Note: The two lofty perfected ones, Mysterious Clarity of the Southern Culmen and Western City, should not have further revelations. Only one precept and one poem each remain. It is unclear when this teaching was imparted.)\n\nThe above eight passages are from Yang’s writings. Practicing these four Ways, according to the superior methods of the Jade Mystery, will astonish the senses within a year. One may then diligently pursue them without doubt.\n\n(The Central Lord’s records on this matter lack the preceding pages, so the exact method is unknown.)\n\nSo says the Perfected One of the Grand Ultimate.",

      "translated_text": "Reading the *Daodejing*’s five thousand characters ten thousand times will summon the cloud chariot to receive you. If after completing ten thousand recitations it has not yet arrived, read it twice a month. You must depart only when the cloud chariot comes.\n\nThe above two passages are from a certain master’s writings.\n\nShanshi Yuan received the method from Master Meng: at dusk, first recite the *Huangting Neijing* once before sleep, so that one’s hun and po may be naturally refined. Practicing this for twenty-one years will also lead to immortality—this is equivalent to ten thousand recitations. Reciting three or four times each evening is excellent.\n\nThe Lady of Northern Peak, Jiang, said: \"Reading this sutra also keeps one free from illness. It is the Way of not dying.\" (This [second] method of twenty-one years, one recitation per evening, does not amount to ten thousand recitations. Perhaps \"one\" should be \"seven\" or \"eight.\" Otherwise, two or three recitations per evening would suffice.)\n\nWhen visualizing the Five Stars, one must carefully follow the *Eight Purities*, beginning with the King Star. Visualize it at the time when generative qi arises. If the King Star does not appear first, do not visualize it first. As for observing the stars, one may do so freely within the chamber. Diligence and sincerity are paramount—it is not necessary to see all the stars clearly before swift communion is achieved. Observation should be precise.\n\nThe Lord of Pure Numinosity instructed: The essential method of visualization is to perceive the Five Stars with the eyes, each descending toward you upon its radiant beam. Then, following the descent of the King Star, visualize it. Swallow one beam, then proceed to the Star of Stability, visualizing it in turn. After a long while, swallow one beam from each of the Five Stars, drawing them all into the mouth and swallowing them, matching the number of the Star of Stability. (This is an alternate method not found in the sutras.)\n\nIf suddenly visualizing the Five Stars, follow the usual method without focusing on their descent. (By this account, the latter is a solitary cultivation method.)\n\nOn the first night of the sixth month, the Perfected One of Azure Numinosity spoke. (The above four passages are from Yang’s writings. \"Azure\" should be \"Pure.\")\n\nThe five celestial script characters of the Sun’s essence are: \"Sun’s soul, Pearl Radiance, Shining Veil, Green Reflection, Swirling Rosy Clouds, Crimson Youth, Mysterious Flame, Whirlwind Image.\" These sixteen characters comprise the Way of the Golden Watchtower’s Sage Lord, who gathers and ingests the flying root. Formerly received from the Celestial Emperor of the Great Tenuity, it is also called the *Sutra of Cinnabar Gold Essence, Stone Radiance, Water Mother, and Jade Embryo*.\n\nThe Right Florescence said:\n*\"Pearl rounds and gathers brilliance, the green veil congeals,*\n*The sun’s rosy clouds blaze bright, the crimson youth holds numen,*\n*Mysterious flame scatters light, the whirlwind’s image stirs the clear.\"*\nSuch is the Sun’s power, the might of its spirit.\n\n(According to the *Purple Text*, this concerns the Sun’s soul, though its meaning is not entirely proper and must be inferred.)\n\nThe above two passages are from a certain master’s writings.\n\n*\"At dawn’s first glow, purple clouds map the dark ridge,*\n*Resplendent, the round light flourishes,*\n*Dazzling, it washes the radiant net.*\n*Vast and distant, the numinous scene’s origin,*\n*Forestalling the empty clarity’s splendor.*\n*The Nine Heavens host jade guests,*\n*In golden chambers, mist and dawn sing.\"*\n\nThe above is from the middle chapter of the *Sutra of the Great Cavern*. Here, several lines are excerpted. (These four lines also appear in the present *Cavern Sutra*.)\n\nForeign lands call the sun *Zhuoyaoluo*. The Perfected One of Square Cauldrons calls it *Round Radiance*. Dreaming of this *Zhuoyaoluo* is the Sun’s response. One who appears amid purple clouds is a spirit of the womb palace—this is the Way of the Mysterious Perfected.\n\nThe Sun’s virtue {broad and yin} is the symbol of long life. Purple clouds at dawn bring peace to the hun and po, health to the body, and tranquility to the spirit. This is where it begins.\n\nWhen the four verses have been presented, the qi and intent become calm and harmonious. (These are Master Yang’s own words in a letter to the Chief Clerk.)\n\nThe Right Florescence’s commentary on the *Sutra of the Great Cavern* explains the meaning of dreaming of *Zhuoyaoluo*.\n\nFarewell. (This is also his own remark. The Chief Clerk’s dream is not clearly described.)\n\nThe above four passages are from Yang’s writings.\n\n*True Reports, Scroll Nine*\n*True Reports, Scroll Ten*\n*Second Harmony of the Auspicious Epoch*\n\n*\"Subtle sincerity moves through principle to stir the hidden Perfected,*\n*Accumulated essence pierces the dark truth.*\n*Gracefully riding cloud hues,*\n*The numinous image leans on purple mist.*\n*Vast and distant, it washes the round net,*\n*Swiftly driving the flying wheel.*\n*Mysterious wings open the dim,*\n*Gazing back, grace renews itself.\"*",

The Lesser Lord now copies this talisman to be worn together. It appears in the *Scripture of the Jade Horse*, also named the *Northern Emperor’s Writ*. (Among the *Seven Primal Talismans*, one lacks a title; tradition holds this to be that talisman, though the *Jade Horse Scripture* has never been seen in the world, and thus no certainty can be claimed.)\n\nOne part realgar, two parts orpiment, three parts massicot. These are the Three Yellow Flowers. First add one part cinnabar to a vessel and grind thoroughly. Next add realgar and grind thoroughly. Then add orpiment and grind thoroughly. Finally add massicot and grind together until well blended. (Mix with clarified glue while grinding.) The term “one” here denotes a single portion by intent, regardless of quantity. (This explains the method of preparing the Three Yellows for talisman-drawing; true talismans often employ this.)\n\nThe above three clauses were written by Yang. When compounding the medicine, one must be precise. Those who lack precision blame the formula’s inefficacy rather than their own failure. Such a person is truly at fault. One may copy the formula and prepare it thus: use five *liang* of calamus (though some use ten *liang*—this is merely the practice of those unfamiliar with the Daoist lineage). Use two *liang* of evodia root bark and three *liang* of purple cloud-lichen blossoms. This is the oral instruction of Lord Zhou. (This concerns the preparation of the initial divine pills; the formula appears in Su’s transmission, having been composed by Zhou Ziyang, and was thus imparted to the Prefect.)\n\nThe above clause was written separately. Prepare one *hu* of processed *atractylodes*. Wash thoroughly with clean water and soak until plump. Then pound finely into powder. Combine with two *hu* of clean water and cook over (gentle fire) until soft. Place in a silk bag and squeeze to extract the liquid. Pour into a bronze vessel and steam over boiling water. Add one (dou) of white honey and a quantity of large dried jujubes, pitted and pounded until skin and flesh are fully blended. Take one (dou) of this jujube paste and mix into the *atractylodes* and honey. Squeeze until thoroughly combined, forming a paste like *bu*. Consume three or four pellets the size of a bullet daily.

Should one wish to pause, the heart will ache for three days, and one must drink in measured portions. This formula may also be used by an entire household. The *Cloud-and-Mist Robe* of nine *liang* is its chief ingredient. (The origin of this passage is unknown; it likely refers to the *White Membrane Powder*. The formula has not been seen in the world.)\n\nThe above passage should not be mixed with those who are not in a state of purification, nor with those who have not embodied the true Dao. Later generations ought to correct this. The highest of the Dao is found in the *Divine Tiger Scripture*. Unless one has received transmission, none may be permitted to see the paper upon which it is written. This is yet another failure to embody the truth.\n\nThe Southern Perfected One said: If the writing of the *Divine Tiger* text is not precise, the myriad things will not serve one’s use, and the heart’s labor will be in vain. When receiving the paper, take care; write with reverence, burn incense, and first inscribe the opening text. One should constantly burn incense beside the written text, ensuring the smoke remains pure and unbroken. Sincerity must be unwavering; the pursuit of the Dao depends solely on tirelessness. Is this not also close to neglect?\n\nThose who attain the Dao always regret not having heard and received it sooner. Those who lose the Dao always regret not having been diligent and earnest. What is meant by *precision*? It is single-minded devotion to the matter. What is meant by *earnestness*? It is reverent cultivation of one’s practice. If one adds to this vigilance and caution, and guards it with the intent to evoke resonance, then one draws near to the truth. You must attend to this without forgetfulness.\n\n(The preceding five passages all seem addressed solely to Lord Yang.)\n\nTo receive the scripture is to take a teacher—yet is this not a cause for shame? Since true sincerity is never exhausted, those who undergo examination are not few. You, sir, once studied *Guardian of the One* under Master Su Lin. You should first purify yourself and receive the precepts. If you can attain this means of transcending the world, the possibilities are beyond measure.",

There is also the *Scripture of the Crooked and the Winding*, stored in the residence of the Western Duke of Clarity. (King Wen of Zhou was the Western Duke of Clarity.) Zheng Zizhen was the grandson of Zheng Kangcheng. He now resides on Yangzhuo Mountain. In his early studies, he suffered for years from unresponsiveness in both legs. In his later years, he used acupuncture and moxibustion, combined with the incantatory method of the Crooked and the Winding, and within a hundred days, all ailments were dispelled. (Zheng Xuan had only one son, who was killed by bandits. He had a posthumous son named Xiaotong. This son neither entered the mountains nor suffered from leg ailments. This Zizhen is also not the one from Gu Valley—his comings and goings are contradictory, and no reliable evidence can be discerned.)\n\nTang Lan now resides on Mount Hua. He obtained the *Method of the Rainbow Elixir* and, having compounded and ingested it, attained immortality. (From the preceding passage to this point, all should be considered *Instructions for Preserving Life*.) Thirteen rounds of acupuncture and three rounds of moxibustion cure all ailments. The left hand surpasses the right. The meridian of the Lesser Yang winds within the left elbow, so thirteen rounds of acupuncture are appropriate to regulate the internal meridian and enter the Lesser Yang. Moxibustion warms the qi, causing it to float upward; when the arm’s blood is afflicted by wind-numbness, three rounds of moxibustion are appropriate to supplement and stabilize the flow of fluids, ensuring the sinews remain unobstructed. Moxibustion should be applied to the *Youguan* of the hand, the *Fengxian*, and the *Five Streams*—these three locations are critically important. One must await an auspicious day.",

He stated: *\"My present tomb holds the Green Dragon’s commanding qi. Above, the Dark Mystery repels misfortune. The Black Warrior extends its form. Tigers roar across the eight directions. It is nearly a cave of immortals, a归宿 for those refining their forms—truly an auspicious tomb of the highest order.\"* Such were his words.\n\n(This refers to the same Fan Jian who earlier adhered to the Three Qi.

Though you have connected with the luminaries and ingested auroral mists, it has brought no true benefit to your body.\" Thereupon, Zhongfu began to take medicinals to treat his illness while continuing his practice. After another eighteen years, he too ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Now he resides in the Dark Realm, where he received scriptures and was appointed Perfected of Central Marchmount, presiding over the Nine Mysteries’ bureau—a post he still holds today. (This account closely aligns with essential matters. No further distinction is made between Zhongfu and his son.)\n\nThe student of the Dao must first pacify the heart and nurture the spirit, ingesting medicinals to treat illness so that the brain palace is filled to fullness and the primordial essence remains unspilled. Only then may one preserve the spirit and ingest auroral mists, drawing in and exhaling the twin luminaries. If one frequently engages in sexual congress, leaking and discharging essence, then qi becomes foul, the spirit flees, and the numinous essence withers to exhaustion. Even if one were to receive the Dark Stave, Jade Records, Golden Scriptures, or the Great Ultimate, how could one escape the bonds of non-life?\n\nOf old, former masters often warned of this matter, saying: \"For the student of the Dao, one act of congress dissipates a year’s medicinal potency; two acts dissipate two years’ potency.

      "translated_text": "Surely, one will attain spiritual resonance. (This also follows the example of morning stillness.)\n\nWhenever one constantly visualizes and recognizes their own form, striving to make it vividly present before them, let there always be the radiance of the sun and moon upon the face, illuminating the entire form. Place the sun to the left and the moon to the right, nine inches from the face. Once visualized, click the teeth three times and softly pray:\n\n*\"Primordial Womb, Supreme Perfected,\nTwin Effulgences, Two Mysteries,\nTo the right, embrace the seven po;\nTo the left, restrain the three hun.\nMay my spirit and luminosity\nEver abide with my form.\"*\n\nAfter the prayer, click the teeth twenty-one times and swallow the saliva seven times. This is called \"The Dao of the Celestial Lord’s Form-Refinement, Hun-Restraint, and Po-Control,\" which renders one spiritually radiant as an immortal, attaining long life without death. If the prayer is not recited, one may simply perform the visualization. (This method includes form-recognition but lacks the prayer in the transmitted teachings.)\n\nMoreover, those who study the Dao must first regulate the hun and po, dispelling the corpse-demons. On the last day of the lunar month, the first day of the new moon, the days of *gengshen* and *jiayin*, one should purify oneself, enter the chamber, bathe to cleanse the dust, and sit upright upon the mat. It is best to remain sleepless. With a cinnabar brush, mark the left corner of the eye, and with a realgar brush, mark the right side beneath the nose, allowing a small portion to enter the valley (philtrum).

Simultaneously, press the second finger of the right hand beneath the right nostril and the second finger of the left hand beneath the left eye, each seven times. Maintain the pressure without lifting the hands. These two points are the gateways through which the seven po and wandering corpse-demons roam, the thoroughfares of thieving essence and malevolent qi. Thus, they receive the essence of cinnabar and realgar, sealing the path of corpse-demons, drawing the fragrance of the Twin Effulgences to suppress licentious chaos.\n\nThis is the Supreme Ultimate’s highest method. Practicing it regularly will harmonize the hun and po, disperse corpse-filth, and ensure long life as an immortal with penetrating vision. After three years of practice, lustful thoughts will entirely vanish. (This closely resembles the method of the Supreme Numinous Perfected and may be cultivated alongside it.)",

They must not be practiced in a disordered or mixed manner, lest the true spirits become confused. Tapping the teeth summons the spirits of destiny; swallowing harmonizes the true. Harmony is received and circulated through the Six Fluids. To govern the spirits, one must sound the drum and proceed in orderly ranks.\n\nIn all practices of the above methods, when performing rituals and invocations, one should first tap the teeth—upper and lower striking each other, not left and right. With each inhalation and exhalation, three taps are ideal. Only after the ritual and invocation are complete should one tap the teeth again before swallowing the various fluids. This is called \"summoning the spirits and harmonizing the true,\" a practice for those who seek ascension as immortals.\n\nI have repeatedly observed that those of false and vulgar habits often misinterpret the scriptural texts, jumbling the sequence and disrupting the order.

The Three Hun will lose their guard, the spirit will wither, and the qi will depart—accumulating until death follows. The reason these days are taboo is not merely to restrain licentiousness or prevent the loss of fluids. It is to pacify the Female Palace, which resides in *shen* (the ninth earthly branch), while the Male Palace resides in *yin* (the third earthly branch). *Yin* and *shen* clash in mutual punishment, and this punitive force intensifies. On these days, the male and female Three Corpses emerge within the pupils of the eyes: the female corpse beckons the male, and the male corpse beckons the female. Disaster and harm flow between them, depleting the spirit and corrupting the true. Though one may not perceive it, the form is already damaged—blood flows from the *Niwan* Palace as the Three Corpses wage war within the eyes. On these days, even the most beloved of women or the most cherished of wives must not be faced. My former master attained immortality solely by cultivating this Dao, without extending exceptions even to the closest kin who might be without intent. You must be vigilant in this.\n\n---\n\nThe *Zhen’gao*, Scroll Ten and Scroll Eleven, and *Jishen Shu*, First Chapter, state: The region of Jinling is the rich marrow of the Cavernous Void, the earthly lung of Juqu. Countless tread its soil, yet none comprehend it.\n\n(These words were orally transmitted by the Lord of Life-Preservation. According to oral tradition, this should have been recorded before the sixth month of the *yichou* year, during the *jiazi* era, when the discussion of this mountain’s blessed origins began. Its soil is fertile, hence called \"rich marrow.\" When waters rise, it floats, hence called \"earthly lung.\" Though generations have traversed it, none have known its true location.)\n\nThe source of Mount Juqu curves to embrace, thus it is named the Village of Juqu. It lies one hundred and fifty *li* across the river; seek, and you shall find it.\n\n(All passages hereafter in large purple script are records from the transmissions of the Three Lords Mao. As these transmissions are treasured and closely guarded, few have seen them. Here, I have carefully transcribed the accounts of the mountain to corroborate and clarify. The mountain’s form bends and winds, extending east and west in meandering turns, hence the name Juqu. The mountain’s ridgeline divides its boundaries: west and north belong to Jurong County, while east and south belong to Yanling. Since Jurong was established as a county, its village no longer exists. In ancient times, it likely lay near Shuxu. Today, the mountain is one hundred and fifty to sixty *li* from the Jiang River at Stone Gate, measured by footpath.)\n\nEast of the Jiang River, amidst the small marshes near Jinling, lies Mount Juqu.\n\n(Here, Jinling refers to Moling, not the \"earthly lung\" of Jinling. The small marsh is today’s Chishan Lake. Gazing directly from the Jiang River toward the mountain, its position aligns east and west as described.)\n\nThis mountain is a cavernous void of inner vision, containing a numinous abode. Its grottoes open in four directions, its caves and peaks stretch long and unbroken. The ancients called it the Void Terrace of Jintan, the Convenient Chamber of the Queen Mother, the Eastern Window of Qingxu, and the Secluded Depths of Linwu. Its caverns interconnect, forming yin paths that lead in all directions—seven routes, nine springs, and four crossroads—making it a true cavern-palace of the immortals.\n\n(This describes the interconnectedness of the grotto-heavens. The Queen Mother resides in the Linwu Grotto beneath Baoshan in Taihu, where the Dragon Might Elder entered and obtained the Five Talismans of Lingbao. Qingxu is the name of the Wangwu Grotto-heaven, indicating that Huayang is linked to this site.)\n\nThe mountain’s shape resembles the character *si* (巳), hence its name, Juqu.\n\n(Today, standing atop the Xuan Ridge of Middle Mao Peak, one gazes before and behind at the ranges and ridges. They coil and curve, with Great Mao as the head, winding east, then north, then west, then north again, then east-northeast to the Great Transverse, folding back and forth like the leftward-written character *si*.)\n\nJinling cannot be harmed by war or flood, nor afflicted by plague or disaster. The *Yellow River Chart*, *Zhong Yao Yuan* Chapter, Scroll Forty-Four, states: \"The altar of Jujin contains a mound where neither war nor sickness treads, nor do surging waves ascend.\" This is the very blessed land. If your heart awakens to this, it is your fortune. Yet know: from whom did this awakening arise?\n\n(This *Yellow River Chart* was received by Shun and Yu, along with the *Luo Book* and its kind. Over forty scrolls remain today. These words were also meant for the Director of Records, signifying that his enlightenment came from the teachings of Lord Yang, which I have further expounded.)\n\nWithin Mount Juqu lies the land of Jinling, spanning thirty-seven or thirty-eight *qing*. This is the earthly lung of Jinling. Its soil is fertile, its well water sweet and pure. To dwell here is to attain transcendence and witness the Great Peace. The *Yellow River Chart’s Inner Yuan Classic* states: \"The earthly lung has good soil and clear water. The mountain of Juqu, the mound of Jintan—here one may transcend the world and ascend to the Curved City.\" The *Yellow River Book’s Middle Chapter* also says: \"The mountain of Jujin contains a mound where neither war nor sickness treads, nor do surging waves ascend.\" This is the meaning.\n\n(The *Yellow River Chart* mentioned later refers to the same passage from the *Zhong Yao Yuan* Chapter. Though the characters for \"mountain\" and \"altar\" differ, the principle remains the same. This specifically describes the earthly lung of Jinling—a single tract of land with such properties. Other places may not share these exemptions.)\n\nJinling was anciently called the Land of Crouching Dragons. The *Yellow River Chart* examines the inverse, and thus records the turning of the kalpas.",

      "translated_text": "The designation \"to come\" is but a provisional name. As for the name \"Jinling,\" it has already endured for over two hundred years. (Tracing the name \"Jinling,\" it originated in the time of Chu. When the First Emperor of Qin crossed the river, he found the qi oppressive and thus renamed it Moling. Since the Han dynasty, the old county seat lay at Small Danyang, still called the \"former seat\" today. In the third year of Taikang of Jin, the lands south of the Huai River were apportioned to it. In the ninth year of Yixi, the seat was moved to 〈missing〉 [Dou]chang. In the first year of Yuanxi, it was relocated to its present site. This is the Jinling east of the river. The \"over two hundred years\" mentioned in tradition refers to when Sun Quan of Wu sent men to mine gold and encamped at Crouching Dragon Mountain, whence the name \"Jinling\" arose—a natural resonance. Thus does one marvel at the *Yellow River Chart*’s inverse omen.)\n\nIn Qin times, Juqu Mountain was called the Altar of Jugold, for within its grotto-heaven stood a hundred-zhang gold altar, whence the name derived. Beyond it lay Mount Jijin, likewise named for its accumulated gold altars. In Zhou times, its source and marsh were called the Cavern of Curved Waters. Observing the mountain’s sinuous form, later generations combined the names into Juqu Mountain. In the Han, the Three Mao Lords came to govern there, and the elders renamed it the Mountain of the Mao Lords. The Three Lords once each rode a white crane, alighting in three separate places on the mountain, seen by many at the time. Thus arose folk songs, and the mountain was further divided into the Three Mountains of the Great, Middle, and Lesser Mao Lords, corresponding to the cranes’ perches. In sum, all remain but a single mountain—Juqu—without other names. The Three Mao Mountains, though linked in sequence, are but one name: Juqu. Later generations, interpreting events, have since branched it into dozens of alternate names, though originally it was not so. (Today, the southernmost and highest is called Great Mao Mountain, its central ridge crowned by three peaks standing like tripods. The next highest, nearer the rear, is Middle Mao Mountain. To the north, a solitary peak with clustered rocks is Lesser Mao Mountain. Between Great and Middle Mao lies Chang’e, its eastern extension reaching Yanling and Juqu, its western leading to Jurong Lake, forming a continuous stone ridge. Mount Jijin and Horse Ridge encircle it like a rampart. Between Middle and Lesser Mao lies Xiao’e, its eastern and western extensions mirroring the same pattern, linked by a small Horse Ridge. Beyond Lesser Mao Mountain’s rear stretch Lei Ping, Swallow’s Beak, Square Peak, Great Horizontal, and Constant Mountain, all connected in unbroken succession, descending to Po[net] Du. South of Great Mao lie Scallion Mountain, Bamboo Wu Mountain, Square Mountain, and beyond them, a chain of ridges reaching to the mountains of Wuxing, extending to Luofu and ending at the Southern Sea.)\n\nThe mountain yields gold.

By the time of Sun Quan, he again dispatched palace guards to extract gold and regularly deliver it to the authorities.

As the *Hetu* foretold in ancient times, it was indeed most wondrous.\n\n(To this day, south of Great Mao Mountain, several deep pits and large hollows remain, traditionally called \"Gold Wells,\" said to have been excavated during Sun Quan’s reign. In the eastern foothills of this mountain, fragments of stone often contain grains of gold. The military commander and his garrison once settled in Fulong, but no trace remains today. Only to the west lies Shuxu, formerly known as Zhuxu, now inhabited by common folk. Some ten *li* ahead of Shuxu, near Great Mao, stands Wu Xu Village, whose name appears similar but bears no connection to Jinling.

      "translated_text": "(Though no fixed landmark may serve as evidence,) in high antiquity this mountain was called Gang Mountain. The *Record of Confucius’ Blessed Lands* states: “Between the ridges of Gang Mountain lies the Hidden Dragon’s Domain, where one may escape floods, ward off illness, and attain long life.” The reason it was originally named Gang is that its substance resembles that of a golden altar. Thus, though a hundred generations have passed and its name has changed a hundred times, it is no longer called by its original name—truly lamentable.\n\n(According to present accounts, a long and massive mountain northeast of Xiao Mao is called Da Heng Mountain, originally named Yu Gang Mountain. This mountain lies east of what is now called the Hidden Dragon’s Domain. The world also refers to the Hidden Dragon’s land as Dead Serpent Ridge, which roughly corresponds to the old name. Observing its length and increasing height, it is also called Chang Yin. *Yin* is pronounced *yu jin* [隱, rhyming with 觐], meaning “to conceal and shield.” Though this Gang Mountain is strewn with small stones, it remains habitable. From the southeast near the Prefect’s residence to the area around Lei Ping, there are many suitable dwelling places. Jiang Yuanchu of Yixing and others have now established fields and homesteads at the foot of the ridge, roughly four or five *li* from the Prefect’s residence.)\n\nBeyond the Golden Court of Tongbai and the Golden Mound of Wu’s Juqu, it is a blessed realm for nurturing the true and a numinous site for attaining the divine. When the waters of the five Yaos poured eastward into the sea, all people fell ill and died—what could the soldiers of Wu’an do to me? For I dwell near the secluded gate of the Terrace of the Sun, relying on this to wander at ease.\n\n(The above was orally transmitted by the Perfected Lord Wang of the Right Assistant [Wang Zhenren] and secretly shown to Lord Xu. This refers to the lands of Wu and Yue spoken of by the Divine Lord of the Dawn of Tongbai. Of these, only the two golden sites are the most blessed. *Wu’an* refers to the Qin general Bai Qi, who attacked Zhao at Changping and in a single day buried alive four hundred thousand men—no military slaughter in antiquity was more brutal. Hence, it is cited here as an analogy. This is what is meant by “soldiers and plague do not come, and great waves do not ascend.” Since it lies near a grotto-heaven and is guarded by divine immortals, it can ensure that the three disasters do not encroach. The preceding five entries are from Yang’s writings.)\n\nWithin the great heavens lie thirty-six grotto-heavens of the earth’s center, the eighth of which is the grotto of Juqu Mountain, encompassing one hundred fifty *li* in circumference. It is named the Golden Altar of Huayang Heaven.\n\n(According to the transmitted records, up to the tenth heaven, these include the five sacred peaks, the eight seas of immortals, and the grottoes of distant barbarian lands. Since these fall outside the present scope, they are not enumerated here.)\n\nThe grotto’s walls are entirely of stone on all four sides, above and below. The flat upper area lies beneath the soil, emerging above ground only after thirteen or fourteen *li*.\n\n(This refers to reaching the summit of the great mountain.) It spans forty-five *li* east to west and thirty-five *li* north to south, perfectly square and level. Its hollow interior measures one hundred seventy *zhang* in height, while the lower part is one hundred *zhang*. Below, the land still rises in mounds and recumbent *earth dragons*, while the upper vault is perfectly flat.\n\n(As previously stated, the high part is one hundred seventy *zhang* and the lower part one hundred *zhang*, meaning the center is elevated and the four sides gradually slope downward. The present statement that “the upper vault is perfectly flat” refers to its surface being level without depressions or protrusions, not that it is flat like a board. It may also mean that when one ascends the mounds, one is lower relative to the heavens.)",

The yin radiance governs the night, and the sun’s essence governs the day. Their forms are round like the sun and moon, flying within the dark void.\n\n(According to the various grotto-heavens, each has these names, though with slight differences. They are likely the sun and moon of the great heavens, their essence divided to shine here. Since they govern day and night, they must rise and set, their brightness and dimness matching the sun and moon of our world. At the edge of the great heavens, one cannot reach the end, but the boundaries of this small heaven may nearly be touched and seen. The rising and setting of its sun and moon must therefore have limits, appearing and vanishing suddenly rather than through any aperture. Yet their size remains unknown.)\n\nThe Grotto-Palace of Juqu has five gates: two side gates to the south, side gates to the east and west, and the great northern side gate—altogether five auxiliary gates.\n\n(Today, the great cavern on the mountain’s south side is the western side gate of the southern face. The eastern gate seems to lie within the ridge of cypress branches. The Liangchang Cavern is the great northern side gate, though the eastern and western gates are not apparent. The Middle Lord stated that the eastern side gate lies at the mouth of Small Mao, east of Middle Mao, and that entering here brings one closest to the grotto-heaven, though the outer opening is very small and blocked with stone. Details follow later. Thus, the western side gate should be similarly concealed, likely at the place now called the Stone Tomb. The cypress ridge has two or three cavern mouths, but the true gate may not open there. If one seeks these three gates with pure devotion, they may yet be found. Though the southern side gate’s outer entrance remains wide open, the inner passage is blocked, likely due to excessive defilement. The great northern cavern still sees the comings and goings of spirits and gods, but true immortals do not enter or exit through the five gates—they pass through all barriers as if they were nothing. These gates exist to show the structure of the mountain grotto or perhaps for those from outside who are meant to enter.)\n\nWithin the void, stone steps wind outward to meet the gateways, allowing passage up and down. Those who come and go in haste do not realize they are within the grotto-heaven and assume they tread an outer path. Since the light of the sun and moon is no different, and the plants, trees, waters, and marshes are indistinguishable from those outside, with birds flying to and fro and winds and clouds thickly gathering, there is nothing to arouse suspicion.\n\nSuch is the divine palace of the grotto-heaven—its numinous wonders boundless, beyond discussion or delusion.\n\n(Those who gather herbs in the world often mistakenly enter such grottoes, where all appears thus, and so they do not find it strange.)",

Upon investigation, the burial of the jade discs occurred prior to the Three Mao Brothers’ attainment of the Dao, yet the full account appears only afterward—thus the Perfected One is revealed to be without obstruction or concealment. According to the traditional account, this event coincided with the imperial ascent of the mountain, though it mentions only a single pair as extraordinary.

The auspicious omens of praise and music were all deemed excellent. Thereupon, the northern ridge of Mount Gouqu was renamed Mount Liangchang, its name derived from this very meaning.\n\n*(According to apocryphal records: In the thirty-seventh year of the First Emperor of Qin, in the first month, he set out on a tour to Yunmeng, Danyang, and the Zhe River, ascending Mount Kuaiji to sacrifice to the Great Yu and gaze toward the Southern Sea, where he inscribed a stele to record his achievements. On his return, he passed through Wu, crossed the river, and traveled along the northern sea until he reached Langye. In Pingyuan, he fell ill, and on the *bingyin* day of the seventh month, he died at Shaqiu. In the ninth month, he was buried at Mount Li. At that time, no defilement had yet occurred. Thus, he took the path from Yanling, ascending through Jurong, and the route along the river still passed through the place where the feast was held—it was not necessarily a deliberate visit to Mount Gouqu. The reason for halting and staying at the northern foothills was not to proceed further over the ridge. Moreover, at that time, the mountain’s numinous marvels had not yet been verified. The purpose of the jade disc offering was to establish a connection with the mountain in view, as the sovereign had declared: *\"All mountains and rivers trodden shall be honored with jade discs.\"* Names follow their owners, and designations arise from the land itself. Later, during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, a minor sovereign received an oral transmission of a purple text stating: *\"Governance shall be established in the northern cavern of Liangchang.\"* This likely became the basis for the name’s adoption.\n\nAnother examination of records shows that upon the First Emperor’s death, his passing was not announced. Instead, his carriage was laden with salted fish to conceal the truth. This corresponds to the sixth month of summer, aligning with apocryphal accounts. However, according to transmitted records, it was the tenth month of the thirty-sixth year, the *jianhai* month, which served as the first month of the Qin calendar. Thus, his tour extended only to Yunmeng. Otherwise, he would have died in the autumn of the thirty-eighth year. Since the Qin calendar was not yet established, it is impossible to definitively determine which month the *guichou* day fell in. This matter requires further detailed verification.)*\n\nIn the third year of Wang Mang’s *Dihuang* reign, on the *wushen* day of the seventh month (the twenty-fourth day of the month), he dispatched the emissary Zhang Chuan with a gift of one hundred *yi* of gold and five bronze bells to present to the Three Immortals of Mount Gouqu. *(Wang Mang’s system used gold as currency, calling it* yi*, shaped like coins but without holes, each weighing one tael and worth one thousand coins. One hundred* yi *thus equaled one hundred taels.)* In the seventh year of Emperor Guangwu’s *Jianwu* reign, on the *dingsi* day of the third month (the twenty-fourth day of the month), he sent the emissary Wu Lun with fifty *jin* of gold to offer to the Three Lords. These gifts were buried together at the highest point of Mount Xiaomao, where the earth had subsided, forming a mound of stones three to four *chi* deep. *(This refers to the present-day highest point of Mount Xiaomao, where the piled stones are located. These two events are not clearly recorded in oral transmissions.)*\n\nIn the second year of Emperor Ming’s *Yongping* reign, an imperial edict commanded prefectures and counties to repair and maintain the shrine of the Perfected Ones of Danyang’s Mount Gouqu. *(Upon the Three Lords’ initial attainment of the Dao, they rode white cranes and appeared on the mountain’s summit, witnessed by villagers who, moved by their efficacious responses to prayers, jointly established a shrine on the mountain’s eastern side, naming it the White Crane Shrine. During sacrifices, voices were sometimes heard, white cranes were seen within the curtains, or the sounds of music and performances were perceived. Thus, the people competed to serve and attend them.)*",

(Today, this ridge is strewn with many large stones, though no steady streams flow on either side of the summit. To the southeast, near the base, lies a long ravine, while to the southwest, near the base, there is also a small stream. South of the ridge, where recluses dwell, a gushing spring near the summit flows ceaselessly through winter and summer, though its water does not appear distinctly red. The level areas are habitable, with the best locations being near the ravine on either side. Zuo’s request for cinnabar likely occurred when he entered the grotto, intending to refine the Nine-Splendor Elixir in the furnace.)\n\nGreat Mao and Central Mao are connected, and within the long vale between them lies a continuous outcrop of stone, anciently called Mount Accumulated Gold. This mountain abounds in golden substances, and the area is well-suited for habitation. One should seek out watered sites to build quiet dwellings—this would be ideal. Any of these several locations will suffice for elixir refinement and the cultivation of the supreme Dao.\n\nBefore Central Mao and behind Great Mao, at the base where a long ravine extends east and west, the mountain opens outward to face a lodge. (This is the east-west ridge where recluses now dwell. The ridge is composed entirely of stone, its forms remarkably strange, with many perforations and side cavities winding deeply downward, some bottomless. When brittle objects are cast in, they produce prolonged, resonant echoes. The claim that the area abounds in golden substances likely refers to items cast here by transcendents over time. To the southwest stands a great stone cliff, split open to reveal a grotto within. After entering several *zhang*, the passage narrows until it no longer accommodates a person, though a rushing wind howls within. Just a few steps outside, a gushing spring flows year-round, providing water for those below. Near the ravine’s mouth, another spring surges upward, its waters swift—warm in winter and cool in summer. Directly opposite, slightly downslope, lies yet another aperture with an extraordinary gushing spring. Neither great floods nor severe droughts alter its flow; its water is slightly white, sweet, soft, and gentle, pouring forth endlessly. The only regret is its location on the mountain’s western side, preventing it from flowing east. One could, however, channel it separately to flow eastward for use.\n\nCrossing this ridge to the southeast, a stone grotto’s water flows eastward, exceptionally fine. The site is secluded and sheltered, highly suitable for elixir refinement.)",

The only regret is their remoteness and openness. Moreover, this entire mountain is free from venomous creatures—no centipedes, vipers, or scorpions. Though green snakes appear from time to time, they harm nothing. Tigers are also rare, and since ancient times, no one has been harmed here. Whether Daoist or lay, those who dwell in these mountains seldom suffer from febrile illnesses. The mountain’s virtue is vast and accommodating, never harsh or perilous.

      "translated_text": "Of late, I have wandered alone with my staff, hoping to record in detail all that I hear and see.\n\nOn the eastern side of Middle Mao Mountain lies a small cave. Its mouth is no larger than a dog’s burrow, barely wide enough for a person to enter. Yet the deeper one goes, the more spacious it becomes. A massive boulder seals the entrance, leaving only a small opening the size of a cup, guarded by the mountain spirits. This boulder occasionally opens of its own accord—it is called the Hidden Palace’s Lateral Gate. After purifying myself through fasting, I sought it out and found the way in, easier to traverse than the entrance to the Good-and-Constant Grotto. Within, many sandy paths twist and turn, and where they cross streams, passage is not always smooth. The route is also long, less convenient than the small Lateral Cave’s entrance. Descending straight down for three or four *li*, one arrives directly at the Hidden Palace’s Eastern Mysterious Side Gate. Two hundred paces inside the cave’s mouth, the darkness suddenly gives way to daylight. (This is the grotto-heaven’s eastern gate, its hidden dimensions now discernible. Yet I have not dared to venture in lightly. Earlier accounts claim the cavern palace extends thirteen or fourteen *li* beneath the earth, whereas this passage reaches the Side Gate in only three or four *li*. This is because the entrance lies near the mountain’s base, and the gate itself is not level. One must descend several more *li* after entering to reach the palace proper. The instant brightness within is due to inner light illuminating the space, not sunlight from outside.)\n\nGreat Mao Mountain also has a small cave on its southern face, nearly identical to the first. It is called the Southern Convenient Gate, its mouth likewise sealed by stone. However, if one purifies the heart with sincere fasting and directs devotion to the Controller of Fate, ascending the mountain on the second day of the month to extend invitations and offer prayers, one will naturally be granted an audience. If sincerity is absolute, how could the Hidden Palace remain unseen? What manner of man was Zuo Ci?

      "translated_text": "Those who regularly ascend the mountain on these two days to extend their welcome, offer prayers, and make entreaties—referring specifically to the second day of the twelfth month—rarely observe the eighteenth day of the third month, though it has occasionally fallen in the first month. Nowadays, the second day of the twelfth month is often bitterly cold with snow, and few from near or far come to the mountain. Only on the eighteenth day of the third month do officials and commoners gather in throngs, with hundreds of carriages and four or five thousand people, both Daoists and layfolk, men and women, their numbers resembling the crowds of a bustling city. They ascend the mountain together, chanting the *Lingbao* hymns of praise, and once the rites are concluded, they disperse. How can there be any among them with profound sincerity or secret communion, yearning to behold the divine Perfected? Even if one or two truly devoted souls appear, they are hindered by the clamor and defilement, unable to focus their minds or express their devotion. Thus, those who seek to be drawn near and receive favor have no means of attaining their goal.\n\nOnly in the secluded dwellings of the central cliffs, where access is restricted and the years kept pure, can one avoid the mingling of crowds. Since these places lie beyond the grotto and across the ridge, people naturally remain unaware of them.\n\nOn the southwestern slope of Mount Liangchang, there are habitable sites—former residences of the Lord Controller of Fate—where one may also compound the elixir. (When the Lord Controller first crossed the river, he established his dwelling here to purify himself and confront spirits and ghosts. Now, the term \"slope\" [*chui*] suggests a boundary or edge, and this location should properly lie west of the great ridge behind the Director’s residence. Yet elders today claim it is the flatland northwest of Great Mao Peak, among the pear trees of the low-lying area called *Xiabo*, said to be the former abode of the Lord Controller. The soil there is rich from cultivation, and many bricks, tiles, and relics of former habitation are unearthed, confirming it as a place once dwelt in. It is also said that the site is potent and must not be defiled. If this is indeed the case, then it should be described as west of Central Mao Peak, not so far as Liangchang. The statements of the Great Perfected are generally imprecise, mentioning whatever location they happen to cite.)\n\nIn former times, the forests and thickets at the foot of the mountain stretched far and wide, obscuring the sky and blocking the sun, offering countless secluded retreats. Now, with logging and farming, the land is open and accessible in all directions, and even the mountains have become exposed. Times change, and circumstances differ—no longer can the past serve as a standard. Yet these claims are not of long ago.",

      "translated_text": "Such conditions have only grown more severe over the past fifty or sixty years. To the southeast of Liangchang, there is another habitable site. Among these places, one may find piled stones resembling the shape of a stove. Within the stove, there may grow a *jisheng* tree, its form curved like a canopy. This site is most excellent—only regrettable for its shallowness. Yet it remains sufficient in itself. (This place still exists today, though no longer with the *jisheng* tree of curved form. It lies near the northern cave’s flowing waters, and on either side, it borders the main road—hence its shallowness. Now, it has become desolate and remote, no longer a place one might go.)\n\nTo the northwest of the cave’s entrance lies a small, precarious plot of land, unstable and unsafe. Yet it would suffice for building a quiet retreat outside. (Today, much of this area has fallen into ruin, gradually encroached upon by villages. It is no longer fit for dwelling. In former times, it was said to be somewhat near the county, making travel convenient, and close to the cave’s entrance—hence its frequent mention. The outer quiet retreat was meant to accommodate traveling guests for rest, not as a place for one’s own cultivation. This further confirms the intent to keep proximity in mind. In the version compiled by Layman Gu, the section on the hermitage sites near this area was originally placed here. Yet in the copy reviewed by the scribe, it was not included in sequence but instead appeared separately before the residence built by the Prefect. In the Prefect’s later reply, he spoke of the northwest land’s instability and then proceeded to discuss Jun Mountain, ignoring the earlier mention of the Golden Village retreat—clearly indicating that the original was transmitted orally.)\n\nWithin the Juqu Mountains lies a place called Jun Mountain.

When I was about to depart, I once buried gold here—those who wish to ingest gold may go and retrieve it. However, one must not use it to pursue private gain and thereby incur burdens.\n\n(Nowadays, people no longer recognize the name Jun Mountain. Examining its form, it should resemble a mushroom standing alone, or perhaps it is [oral corruption of] \"Cang\" [苍], shaped like [ ]. According to the records, behind Great Mao Peak and east of Chang’a, in the valley where gold accumulates, there stands a solitary hill, towering like a Boshan incense burner. Moreover, it lies near the Gold-Accumulating Mountain, so this may well be the place. Today, it is overgrown with rocks and trees, and though the gold’s location is indicated in one or two spots, it would be difficult to search for. Only if you deign to grant permission would it be possible—no question of that. If one intends to undertake the work of refining and transmutation, this mountain’s front faces a long ravine where eastward-flowing water runs deep and secluded, possessing a favorable topography. Should construction ever be planned, I will provide further details.)\n\nOn Great Mao Mountain, there is a bronze tripod from the time of the Dark Emperor. (The ancient character for \"tripod.\") The tripod can hold four or five *hu* or so. Its casting and engravings are exceptionally fine, and it lies in the mountain’s highest spot, buried eight *chi* deep. A slab of stone covers it. The Dark Emperor commanded the Spirit of the Eastern Sea to conceal it here. (This was likely buried when the Anxi stone was relocated. Today, the highest point is strewn with rocks, and on auspicious days, Daoists from near and far all ascend to burn incense and pay homage. No grass or trees remain, only a small altar built of piled stones. There once stood a small tiled hut, but it collapsed in the wind.

In recent generations, some have come to dwell here. Only in the early Song did the Daoist nun Xu Piaonü, supported by Prefect Lu Hui of Guangzhou, live for many years before her passing. Her disciple, surnamed Song, was a woman of lofty purity, untouched by worldly concerns. She grew old and died, and was buried south of the mountain. Song’s disciple, surnamed Pan, then inherited the residence and remains there to this day. During the Yuanhui era, several men also came to dwell in the area. By the early Qi dynasty, an edict was issued to Wang Wenqing of Jurong, who established a lodge here called Chongyuan. Halls, chambers, and side corridors were built, making it quite grand. Typically, seven or eight Daoists resided there, all supported by official stipends. For over twenty years, men and women from near and far have gathered here in succession, their dwellings stretching for several *li*, with over ten compounds.

(The Prefect’s later reply to this was also rather artful and evasive.) These letters and documents must be kept from the sight of common folk. Should any layperson see them, they would dig up and desecrate the sacred mountain—your offense would be grave indeed. (This fears that cunning and avaricious men, learning of these golden treasures, would be capable of tunneling into the mountain, thus spreading the secret. Such a transgression would be no light matter. Not only would it violate the present admonition, but it would also leave an endless legacy of harm, burdening future generations. All must keep this strictly concealed.)\n\nThe above is the Lord of the Register’s reply to the Prefect’s earlier letter, concluding the discussion of matters concerning Mount Juqu. The Prefect’s original letter is no longer extant; only this later response remains, arranged here in order of the topics addressed.\n\nThe preceding twenty-one items were all transcribed by clerks. In my youth, around ten years of age, I heard elders in Xuxu (this should be written as *xu* [墟], though it has long been rendered as *xu* [虚]—the name of a village in present-day Shanxi) speak of how Mount Mao was once home to immortals and even had a marketplace, though they had long since departed. Later, when I asked Lord Bao about the mountain’s condition, he replied that the immortals still resided there and had not moved away. This mountain is the western gate of the Dongting Grotto-Heaven, connected to the Baoshan range within Lake Tai, which is why the immortals dwell within it. However, he mentioned only the Middle Immortal Lord by name, making no reference to his three brothers, nor distinguishing their seniority, nor noting that the Lord of Life holds a more exalted rank and governs separately in the Eastern Palace. As no records of this have been seen, it becomes clear that there are distinctions in rank and hierarchy.\n\nI now respectfully heed your instruction and amend my understanding accordingly. (The Prefect later added in another reply: “I have drafts of this letter preserved, which is why I was able to compile and record it. However, the opening section of the previous page is missing, so this does not begin at the original start.” Lord Bao was Bao Qingjian of Jurong, universally called “Bao.” By the time of this reply, he had already received the transmitted records—this was the beginning of the *yichou* year.)\n\nProceeding three or four *li* directly down from the mouth of Little A, one arrives at the Eastern Dark Gate of the Yin Palace. Entering two hundred paces into this cavern mouth, the interior becomes as bright as daylight. I wonder whether this distinct radiance of the grotto-heaven is drawn from the sunlight to illuminate the cave, or if it possesses its own luminosity. Within this grotto-heaven, the palaces and bureaus are vast, said to comprise hundreds of halls and chambers. The officials here include the two Immortal Lords, brothers, as well as other immortals—how many men and women reside within? Are these merely stone chambers, or are there also halls of gold and jade? Are the palaces connected to Dongting and Baoshan? Did Lord Bao and his sister, Lady Zhu, ever enter this palace while in the mortal world? Were the two of them not yet deemed worthy of ascension and thus appointed as subterranean lords? Where is their seat of governance?\n\nI, dull and ignorant, venture these questions, fearing they may give offense. (The matter of Lord Bao and his sister was not mentioned in the Middle Lord’s earlier letter; this must have been separately conveyed. Now, these questions are raised again, along with inquiries about the grotto, to which the *Dinglu* has provided further replies.)\n\nThe market’s stone platform and the name of the marketplace endure because of this. Today, I remain steadfast in my devotion to the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "So too do the host of spirits earnestly urge and encourage—it is told that Great Mount Mao likewise has a small cavern on its southern face, nearly identical to the first, called the Southern Convenient Gate. Joyful to receive your awakening counsel, I delight in this virtuous instruction. With single-minded devotion, I shall purify myself and renew my resolve. Having learned of the auspicious day, I shall arrive in secret at the appointed time. Though my sincerity be humble, the numinous powers will surely witness and reflect it. (This is the eastern gate of the southern face of the Dao, resembling the small eastern gate of the hidden palace.)\n\nAs for the identity of Zuo Ci—these words of praise and exhortation, this gracious regard extended even to one so lowly, only deepen my admiration. (Earlier records also mention this matter.)\n\nIt is told that at the southwestern edge of Mount Liangchang lies a place fit for dwelling, once the separate residence of the Lord of Life and Death, where elixirs may also be compounded. As I have seen in the transmitted records, my heart secretly aspires to seek out the former abode of the Lord of Life and Death, a lofty retreat. Yet I fear I cannot ascertain it with certainty. Now I shall quietly assess and seek a suitable place, and when the time comes, I shall seek further guidance. (Earlier records also mention this. The foundations have long since crumbled, making exact knowledge difficult—hence this request for further instruction.)\n\nIt is further told that to the southeast of Mount Liangchang lies another dwelling place, marked by piled stones like a stove and a *jisheng* tree resembling a curved canopy. One should seek out this site when the time comes.\n\nIt is told that northwest of the cavern’s mouth lies a small, precarious, and unstable plot of land, where an outer meditation hut may be built. My original intent was to establish both inner and outer meditation huts, and I shall now carefully consider what is most fitting. (I have never heard of such an outer meditation hut being built before, yet now there stands a clearly visible altar of piled stones. Tradition holds that an official once vanished here in a transformation—whenever I visit and pay my respects, I am moved to sigh with lingering emotion.)\n\nIt is told that Mount Jun is most excellent. Before departing, the Lord of Life and Death buried gold there, which those who wish to ingest gold may retrieve. I myself have long harbored the intention to compound golden liquid, though I dare not yet pursue this. If I dwell on the mountain for years, advancing daily in cultivation and learning, then in time, if the matter may be undertaken in secret, I shall seek your counsel at the proper moment. (The Writ of the Middle Lord states: \"Before I departed, I buried gold,\" without specifying the Lord of Life and Death. The Prefect’s answer here is mistaken.)\n\nIt is told that on Great Mount Mao lies the bronze tripod of the Dark Emperor’s time, buried eight *chi* deep in the highest part of the mountain. This is an imperial site—□□□□□, the vessel left to instruct later generations. I am all the more grateful for this instruction, which may also serve as a place to establish a meditation hut. Deeply moved, I record this for my enlightenment.\n\nAs for the buried bronze and coins of the former Qu clan—this is entirely unrelated to our present purpose. Hearing of such distant matters, of eras long transformed, how can one not sigh with sorrow?\n\nWhen I first received your letter on the eighth day of the eighth month, I set out at once to the empty village (this was still the former hamlet) and stayed briefly with my family. Then, upon receiving a letter from home, I learned that the response was that I should not yet ascend the mountain.

Having received your gracious examination, I find my words at odds with the matter—nothing remains but awe and trepidation.\n\n*(Prefect Xuanting’s every movement is thoroughly known; even the slightest of my words, once uttered, is promptly reported and met with a response. Perhaps this was conveyed by Master Yang. Xu Fan’s household still remains. The later reference to \"Xu Ou\" should indeed be \"Fan\" afterward. Thus I know the location of the well and residence—his ancestor was once a disciple of the Prefect.)*\n\nLong ago, I claimed the fields at Red Stone, which lie near the foot of the mountain and serve as a path for coming and going. This was my sincere intent. But soon after, a drought struck: the tenants reaped no harvest, and the embankment collapsed. Mu was then employed to oversee repairs, yet my strength has not sufficed to complete the task. It is not that I have abandoned the endeavor. Now that I dwell at the mountain’s base, I must resume cultivation. The distance from the cave’s entrance is the only reason I hesitate to settle there.\n\n*(These fields lie west of the Greater and Lesser Mao peaks, close to the great mountain. The view for gazing upward and paying reverence is excellent. Yet when I say the cave’s entrance is distant, I mean specifically the northern entrance. Though the fields are fed by the ravine’s waters, in times of drought the flow dwindles, and building an embankment is difficult. I do not know whether I will ever reclaim them. The embankment still breaches; repairing it would require hundreds of laborers, but could then irrigate ten or so qing of land. The disciples at the hermitage also sow and plant here as the water allows. I have long wished to restore this embankment, both to honor the legacy of the past and to bestow a boon upon the people.)*\n\nMy letters are crude and artless—how could I cease writing them?

      "translated_text": "Here begins the translation:\n\n---\n\nI was initiated into the mysteries at the Golden Portal of the Primal Register, transcending worldly traces and ascending to the pure void. How vast and distant is the mark of the mysterious! How deep and remote the abyss of wondrous caverns! To master oneself and purify the heart, to bathe in the fragrant streams—if one can achieve this, now is the time.\n\nYour last letter spoke of glimpsing essential principles and cultivating the Five Spirits. You claimed to have journeyed west to the gardens of *Menliang* and roamed east to the Mystic Isles, yet without striving to the utmost, seeking only to be guided and drawn forth. Such words, if truly rooted in the heart, may indeed open the way. The cultivation of the Five Spirits, too, has reached my ears. Yet the Dao drifts upon external traces, untouched by inner truth. Thus, the cloud chariot’s sacred shafts, though aligned, remain distant.\n\nIn ancient times, Zeng Shen and Hua Qiao (from this, we know Hua Qiao was once graced by the descent of the Perfected) responded to the summons of the age, for matters may arise unexpectedly. The waters need not be still; if one has the destiny but lacks the resolve, it is the very affliction Shen Gong lamented—meeting the ultimate yet failing to act, like spilled water that cannot be gathered again. Thus, the ancients said: *\"When the time comes, do not hesitate; the mountain recluse claps his hands in joy.\"*\n\nThose who study the Dao must not rely solely on their innate endowment but must preserve and uphold purity and wholeness. Then may they gallop toward the age of the pine, turn the wheel through the Purple Clarity, where the numinous vision resounds on all sides, and the mysterious tones harmonize in chorus. Jade chimes resound through the clouds, attuned without deliberation—this may be called the hidden treasure of the secret Dao, the supreme flourishing of true radiance.\n\nYou, Jian, have long held such aspirations; now I merely return to your former intent. (This letter appears to be Master Pei’s words, while Yang’s letter does not connect to the later questions of the Mystic Emperor. It may not be Master Zhong’s reply. Moreover, the original four letters of the Chief Clerk no longer survive.)\n\nAs for the Mystic Emperor: of old, the Yellow Emperor’s son, Changyi, wed the daughter of Mount Shu, and she bore Gaoyang, whose virtue was titled *Ruipian* and *Yupian*. *Ruipian*’s father dwelled in the land of Weak Waters, while *Yupian* himself was tempered at the ford of the Seven Rivers—this is the Mystic Emperor. Wielding the trust of the myriad spirits and overseeing the host of gods to guide all things, he commands the hundred qi, summons thunder and lightning. Thus, riding his chariot of primordial union, he journeyed north to Youling, south to Jiaozhi, west across the Flowing Sands, and east to the Coiling Tree. All beings, great and small, all gods within the light of sun and moon, were subject to him. Traversing the four directions and circling the eight extremities, wherever there were mountains of jade terraces or mounds of yin palaces, he transported the stones of Anxi to seal and fill them. Casting bronze from Mount Yu into precious tripods, he offered one each to the divine peaks of the Grotto Mountains—not merely Mount Juqu alone. This is the so-called Mystic Emperor.\n\n(What follows is Master Zhong’s reply to the four inquiries posed earlier, written on the blank space above. The account of *Ruipian* and *Yupian* aligns with the *Five Talismans*, except the latter omits the matter of burying the tripods.)\n\nBao *Qingjian* and his sister were both seventh-generation descendants of Li Zhan and Zhang Lü, originally from the northern village of Duling. They kept an inn at the Wei Bridge, accumulating hidden virtue and yearning for the Dao in hopes of transcending life.\n\n---",

      "translated_text": "Thus did their blessings extend to Bao *Qingjian* and his kin, enabling them to undergo transformation through kalpas, to alter their surnames and renew their lives—united as brothers. Though their ancestral roots differed, the shade of virtue they shared was the same, and so they were destined to be born into the same clan. Now, both serve as lords of the underworld, dwelling within the Grotto Palace.\n\nWhat Bao *Qingjian* studied was originally shallow and meager, and his nature was further hindered by entanglements, so his attainment was not great. Should you wish to know the matter, it is thus: it resembles your own seventh-generation ancestor, Xu Zhao, styled Zi’a, who possessed the benevolence of rescuing the dying and the virtue of relieving the starving. Thus did his cloud-like shade flow to posterity, his hidden merit casting its blessing downward. It is for this reason that you now harbor a heart inclined toward the immortals and the perfected—this, too, arises from a cause. All things have their convergences of conditions; none attain them idly.\n\n(At the time of this writing, the Master’s instructions had not yet been transmitted, which is why the discussion touches upon Zi’a’s meritorious shade. Bao was also versed in the numinous, yet he esteemed the arts of the bedchamber, hence the term “entanglements.” Later, he employed the *Tai Xuan Yin Sheng Fu* of the Yin Lord as the method of Great Purity’s corpse-liberation—this must be the highest rank among the lords of the underworld. Thus do the threads of fate and affairs intertwine in this manner. As for the good and evil of people today, how could they be said to arise without cause?)\n\nAs for Ge Xuan: he was skilled in transformations and illusions but clumsy in the mastery of his own body. Now, he has merely attained undying life, not true immortality. Initially dwelling on Mount Chang, he later entered Gai Zhu.

He exchanged his horse for a coffin and removed his own robes to shroud the body. Soon after, he came upon an old acquaintance starving and stranded on the road. Unable to bear leaving him, he slaughtered the ox pulling his carriage to feed him.

During the reign of Emperor Huan of Han, he served as magistrate of a county in Xuzhou, and later, during Emperor Ling’s reign, as an aide to the Grand General. From youth, he was devoted to the Dao, skilled in arts and calculations, and practiced the ingestion of sesame and *huangjing* (黄精).

Appointed Gentleman Consultant for his upright conduct, he later served as Remonstrating Censor, Grandee of Zhao Commandery, and Prefect. He followed Wei Wu on a western campaign, falling ill and dying in Chang’an. The accounts of their names and styles vary greatly. Cheng and Feng appear similar but were not Yuan’s sons-in-law.

His father was named Qi. During the reign of Emperor Shun, he served as Minister over the Masses. Kuan was a man of prudence and sincerity. Once, a man who had lost his ox came to identify it among Kuan’s carriage oxen. Without a word, Kuan unyoked the ox and gave it to him, then walked home. Shortly after, a man of conscience found the ox and returned it. Overcome with shame and fear, the man was dismissed with thanks by Kuan. In the eighth year of Emperor Huan’s* Yanxi *era, he became Governor of Nanyang, where he consistently used whips of rushes. In the fifth year of Emperor Ling’s* Jiaping *era, he was appointed Grand Commandant. Once, while at the imperial seat, he dozed off drunk. The emperor asked, “Is the Grand Commandant drunk?” Kuan looked up and replied, “Your servant dares not be drunk. It is only that my burden is heavy and my responsibility great—my heart is as if drunk with worry.” Once, a guest arrived at Kuan’s home, and Kuan sent a servant to buy wine. The servant returned late and thoroughly drunk. The guest cursed him as a beast. Shortly after, Kuan sent someone to check on the servant, fearing he might take his own life. He said to his attendants, “This is a man, yet he was cursed as a beast—what greater humiliation could there be? This is why I feared for his life.” Later, he was enfeoffed as Marquis of Dai with six hundred households. He passed away in the second year of the* Zhongping *era at the age of sixty-six and was posthumously honored as General of Chariots and Cavalry. The court later bestowed the posthumous title* Zhaodao *Marquis. His son Song succeeded him. As this account differs in some respects, it is recorded here in detail.

At times, the Guest of Mount Gui would also gather with them—such were the days of grand assemblies of true immortals. How could one but briefly ascend to the realm of the Crouching Dragon to pay reverence at the sacred peak? It should be made known to Lord Xu. (This also appears to refer to the Middle Lord. As previously mentioned on the first day of the twelfth month, the Venerable One of the Eastern Palace is the Azure Lad, and the Guest of Mount Gui is the Queen Mother of the West. The earlier scroll also contains this instruction, bidding one to ascend the Crouching Dragon to gaze upon the mountain and perform obeisance—distinct from merely climbing a ridge. It is not necessarily a matter of proximity but rather what is fitting.)\n\nIn ancient times, there was a man who loved the Dao yet did not know the method of seeking it. He did nothing but bow and kneel morning and night before a withered tree, repeatedly pleading, \"Grant me long life.\" For twenty-eight years, he never wearied. One day, the withered tree suddenly burst into bloom, its flowers exuding a sap as sweet as honey. Someone instructed him to consume it, so he ate both the flowers and the sap. Upon finishing, he became an immortal. Such was the utmost sincerity of his devotion. If even a withered tree can produce purple blossoms and yield sweet nectar, how much more should the numinous terrace of the Three Radiant Ones and the Five Mushrooms’ abode respond to frequent reverence of the mountain peaks, washing away impurities? Truly, it is lamentable.\n\nThe reason worldly people so often fail to attain their desires is no different from why you fail to attain yours—how could it be otherwise?\n\nOnce, there was a man named Liu Shaoweng who frequently entered Mount Taihua, bowing in reverence toward the mountain. After twenty years of this, he suddenly beheld the Elder of the Western Peak, who bestowed upon him the Dao of immortality. (The *Prohibited Mountain Talismans* mentions the Lord of the Western Peak; it is unclear whether this Elder is the same.)\n\nAnother man would go to the riverbank every dawn to bow to the river. After ten years of this, the River Earl and the River Lord appeared to him, presenting him with ten pairs of white jade disks and teaching him the method of walking on water without drowning. This man later attained the Dao on the Central Peak.

All actions and undertakings must be kept discreet. (The *Precepts of the Azure Lad* states: \"In learning the Dao, one must be diligent and discreet. Diligence means unceasing effort day and night; discretion means that none but oneself knows.\" The Central Lord reiterates this—truly the ultimate admonition, a single phrase that encompasses all.)\n\nThe above was dictated by Lord Dinglu for transcription.

      "translated_text": "She wept bitterly for a long while before departing—this too was deemed extraordinary. Yet it remains unclear why both brother and sister should inherit the blessings of seven generations: the brother executed while the sister attained transcendence—this cannot be the Northern Dipper of the Daoist tradition. The ghostly bureaucracy has its own Northern Dipper Lord, who governs life and death.\n\n(According to records, when Sun Hao’s defeated general Zhang Ti’s soldier Liu Rong fell ill and died, after three days he suddenly rose with a great cry, saying, “I reached the gates of the Northern Dipper, where I saw men binding Zhang Ti.” Startled, he faltered, and that very evening, Zhang Ti perished in battle. This would seem to correspond to the Fourth Palace. As for the Fifth and Sixth Palaces, whose domains remain obscure, they may well be the courts of judgment and retribution.)\n\nThe Supreme Emperor of the ghostly bureaucracy is the Northern Emperor, who presides over the First Heavenly Palace and governs all Six Heavenly Palaces. The remaining four palaces are each administered by the Four Luminous Lords.\n\n(Though each is said to govern one palace, their specific locations are not clearly defined. Since the palaces stand in parallel, they cannot be assigned to the four cardinal directions. Examining the hierarchy of the Lords, the Second Palace is governed by the Western Luminous Lord, the Third by the Eastern Luminous Lord, and the Fourth by the Northern Dipper Lord, with the remaining two following in sequence.)\n\nEach pair of heavenly palaces is overseen by one official, making three officials in total across the six heavens—akin to the offices of penal law, responsible for judgment and punishment. These are perpetually overseen by true immortals and the Lords of Life, who collectively govern them and share the duty of administering life and death. All major decrees and judgments issue from the immortal officials.\n\n(This is the \"Three Officials\" often invoked in Daoist tradition. The *Scripture on Dispelling Demons* states that Mount Tai has a Left Fire Official, a Right Water Official, and a Female Official, also called the Three Officials, all charged with punishment. Today, the Three Mao Lords oversee them: the Great Lord as commander, and the Lord of Life as inspector. Their subordination to the immortal officials stems from the fact that not all people in the world die; some attain true transcendence and thus fall outside the Northern Emperor’s jurisdiction. Others, though dead, may undergo spiritual transformation and regain form—such cases are recorded by the true immortals. Hence, the office of the Lord of Life governs and unifies these matters.)\n\nThe Northern Dipper Lord of the ghostly bureaucracy serves as the examining official for the Daoist Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper. This ghostly office is also subordinate to the essence of the Nine Stars and ultimately answers to the Jade Lord of the Northern Dawn.\n\n(The Northern Dipper in the heavens has its own overseers, so the ghostly bureaucracy mirrors this with a corresponding office. Its authority derives from the *Jade Rotating Square* and the *Jade Tablet*, thus it is ultimately subordinate to the courts of the Most High.)\n\n... [text missing] ... need not all come directly. I shall reveal to you one or two secrets, fellow kindred spirits, so you may know the tranquility of the Dipper’s hidden realm. How can one not be diligent in the Dao?\n\n(These three individuals are not mentioned in other texts. During the Later Han, there was a Li Yun, who also served as Magistrate of Baima and was executed for his forthright remonstrance. The phrase \"fellow kindred spirits\" refers to his address to the Chief Clerk and his subordinates.)\n\nOn the night of the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month, the Lord of Life delivered this message.\n\n(According to earlier records, though the Chief Clerk, Sima, and others were informed by the Register of Destiny, this appears to be the initial account of the grotto’s affairs, dated the eleventh month of the *chou* year. The present mixed account, however, should follow later and is instead dated the seventh month, though it does not correspond to the *yin* year. The sequence is difficult to reconcile. Fourteen entries in total were received from the subterranean authorities, transcribed by clerks into a single scroll.)\n\nThe Cavern of Embracing Reality exists within all grotto-heavens, not only here. This particular cavern belongs to the Supreme Prime Prefecture and is subordinate to the Lord of Life. Within it, two female transcendents preside: one is Zhang Weizi, daughter of Zhang Qing, Grand Minister of Works during the reign of Emperor Zhao of Han.

Weizi regularly ingested mist-qi, claiming that mist-qi is the essence of mountains, marshes, water, and fire—the fullness of qi within metals and stones.

Weizi stated that she received this method from Chun Wenqi, the Jade Consort of Eastern Florescence in the Eastern Sea, who is the younger sister of the Azure Lad. Once, Weizi concentrated her thoughts in secluded stillness, her sincere heart moving the numinous, and so Wenqi descended to her. She transmitted the Dao of ingesting mist.\n\nAfter receiving the Dao of mist-ingestion, Weizi also taught it at times to those studying in the Grotto of Embracing Reality and the Grotto of Easy Transitions.

First, close your eyes and inwardly visualize, faintly perceiving the five viscera. Then exhale through the mouth twenty-four times. Do this while keeping the eyes closed, so that you see the five-colored qi swirling and coiling around your face in a dense cloud. Next, inhale this five-colored qi through the mouth fifty times. Afterward, swallow saliva sixty times. Then softly recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Great radiance emits brilliance,\nNuminous mist shifts on all sides.\nBound qi coils and bends,\nFive colors fill the grotto-heaven.\nDivine smoke converges and opens,\nMetals and stones bloom with true essence.\nLush and deep, the purple void,\nRefining form to preserve wholeness.\nEmerging in light, hidden in seclusion,\nFive spirits transform and divide.\nUnited brightness fans the emptiness,\nAt times riding the six clouds.\nHarmonizing and gathering my body,\nAscending to the nine heavens.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, knock the teeth together seven times and swallow saliva seven times.

The method of the Three Qi involves visualizing the blue qi, white qi, and red qi, each like {a thread extending}, descending from the sun in the east and entering directly into the mouth. {The hands press} ninety times. Once satiated, one stops. Practicing this for ten years, the three-colored qi naturally reside within the body, and one thereby attains transcendence as a divine immortal. This is the High Lord Yuan’s *Method of the Primal Inner Radiance* from the *Great Simplicity*. Perform it daily at dawn, conducting it with eyes closed. Gazing at the sun is also beneficial. Though the method is rarely transmitted, its effects are profoundly verified. Lord Xu may practice it. (This method was also transcribed in a duplicate text, found in the third chapter under \"Cultivation Practices.\")\n\nFan the Overseer is this very person. Formerly, he served as the Youthful Overseer of the Beginning; now he resides in Huayang. (Elsewhere it is said he once served as a Han dynasty Palace Attendant and was skilled in geomancy, taking grave sites and dwellings as his focus. This is also recorded in the third chapter.)\n\nThe three entries above are all from Yang’s writings.\n\nLi Zheng of Henei formerly received the *Method of Guarding the One* and the *Cavern Chamber* and attained the Dao. Initially dwelling on Mount Luoyang, he has recently entered Huayang. He also oversees matters of examining and exorcising malevolent influences among the people. Zheng once served as tutor to the Duke of Changdao Township. When he received the Dao and entered the mountains, he was already sixty years of age. (It is unclear what office Li held; he likely served in an overseer’s post. The Duke of Changdao Township was Emperor Yuan of Wei’s original enfeoffment.)\n\nTo the northeast of {Wangzheng} Mountain lies a cave that connects to the southern cave of Fang Mountain in the great Juqu region. Jiang Bozhen frequently ascended this mountain to gather *shinao*. The *shinao* lies beneath the northern cave of Fang Mountain. Master Fanyang also once gathered and ingested it. ({Wangzheng} Mountain is still part of the Great Horizontal Mountain. As later stated, “The aide constantly traveled with five individuals from Fang Mountain.” However, it is unknown whether a path leads into the grotto-heaven.)\n\nMaster Fanyang is He Miao of the Deer Track Cavern. This substance is also found in the northern Zhushan. (The location of Zhushan is unclear. North of Juqu, west of Deer Track Mountain, there is a place called Zhujiao Mountain, which is likely the site.)\n\n*Shinao* resembles stone but is slightly speckled in color and {coarse and large}.

      "translated_text": "(For this is merely a matter of failing to seek with utmost sincerity.) Within Baoshan Mountain grows white *zhi*. There is also the water of Hidden Spring, a true purple in hue. (This is Mount Linwu, situated in the great Wu lake.)\n\nOn Huayang’s Mount Leiping lies the Field Lord’s Spring. Drinking its waters expels the three worms from the abdomen, and its flavor matches that of Hidden Spring. It is said to be the flowing essence of jade-sand. Used to launder clothes, it requires no lye—this being its singular marvel. (This water now wells up from the earth, resembling boiling water in appearance, yet its taste is surpassingly fine. When used to wash soiled garments, they become clean at once. This is the place now called Willow Vale, located roughly one *li* southeast of the Prefect’s residence.)\n\nIn the time of Gao Xin, there was an immortal named Master Zhan of the Upper Rank who planted plums upon the Earth of Crouching Dragons, filling the land with them. Master Zhan now serves as the Right Guardian of the Nine Palaces. He often tells others: “In former days, while dwelling beneath Huayang, I ate white plums of extraordinary sweetness. The memory lingers still, yet in an instant three thousand years have passed.” (Various chronologies record that from the first year of Yao’s reign—*wuxu*—to the *jimao* year of the Qi dynasty, 2,803 years elapsed. Gao Xin was Yao’s father, so this statement must date to the Jin era. To speak of three thousand years when only 2,800 have passed since Yao’s time suggests that external calendars may be imprecise. For instance, the *dinghai* count would already have been exceeded. The *Bamboo Annals* record a precise span of 2,643 years—an even greater discrepancy.)\n\nLater, Guo Sichao planted the Five Fruits in that same place. The land is also suitable for cultivating *mu-shi*—the *mu-shi* of Blessed Land, used to dispel calamities and the myriad ills. During the Qin, the Daoist Zhou Taibin and Jiang Shumao, the Marquis of Baling, came to reside beneath Mount Juqu. They also planted the Five Fruits and the Five Pungent Vegetables. Shumao was enfeoffed as marquis during the reign of King Xiao of Qin. The place is now named Jiangba after him, for the land took its name from Shumao. (The name remains to this day. A great road runs from behind Small Mao Peak to Yanling, and is called Jiangba Road. However, during the reign of Duke Xiao of Qin, the state had not yet annexed Chu to establish commanderies, and Baling County was only founded in the early Jin. It is unclear how there could have been a marquisate of Baling—likely it refers to the Ba of Bashu.)\n\nBoth men attained immortality and now serve as Left Ministers on Penglai. The various Jiangs of Nanzheng are descendants of Shumao. Shumao once wrote to the officials of the Supreme Ultimate Palace, saying: “Formerly, I studied the Dao in Guigu, attained it in Shaoshi, nurtured my *ge-yu* in Huayang, and awaited ascension in the Realm of Leisure. At times, I rode the whirlwind-chariot, feasting in Juqu. I awoke to the swift passage of time, how things endure while people perish—what toil is this?” Taibin was also a man of talent and skill, adept at playing the zither. He once taught Mi Changsheng and Sun Guangtian. Guangtian was none other than Sun Deng, who could play eight notes on a single string—a truly marvelous feat. (Sun Deng is the same “long-whistler” mentioned by Xi Kang of Mount Kuaiji, who also spoke of seeing him play the one-stringed zither. These words are not empty.)\n\nShumao cultivated the Five Pungent Vegetables and often sold them to purchase cinnabar for his use. Even now, among the mountains, leeks and scallions remain—perhaps his lingering seeds. (The place is now called Leek Mountain, west of Great Mao Peak, where large leeks grow in abundance. Garlic and scallions also appear elsewhere, not solely in Jiangba.)\n\nBefore the present dwelling lies a pond, constructed by Guo Sichao. He raised its embankments so the water would be deep. Yet over the long ages, the pond walls have crumbled. (The present dwelling seems to refer to the Prefect’s residence. Before it lies a pond, with a dike to the west—this dams the waters of Willow Brook. Yet it is far from Guoqian, which lies northwest of the Northern Grotto. There is a large reservoir there, where Sichao likely once resided. The meaning of “before the dwelling” is unclear; perhaps the Prefect established fields there. Further details may follow.)\n\nSichao often sailed a small boat upon the pond, striking the hull and singing:\n*“A clear pool girds the numinous peak,*\n*Long forests lush with verdant green.*\n*The dark bird hides in secluded wilds—*\n*In leisurely words, I speak my mind.*\n*I ply my oars upon the sacred waves,*\n*Bowing my head to seek the Morning Wind.*\n*Yet the hour of liberation eludes me,*\n*And I wander free among these hills and groves.”*\n\n*(The “Morning Wind” refers to the wind of the Jade Dawn of Supreme Purity, not the bird of that name in the *Mao Odes*.)*\n\n*“Beyond the Nine Abysses, the waves surge with gods,*\n*I refine the Dao and attain the Golden Perfected.*\n*This is the feather of the numinous phoenix.”*",

Chensheng was the Left Duke of Penglai. When I discoursed with him on Nonbeing, he roughly grasped my meaning. Beyond this, he still could not fathom the root of Being—how then could he fathom the root of Nonbeing?

Qiulin was the wife of Wei Xingdao, the Han dynasty General of the Tower Ships. Having studied the Dao and attained immortality, she then imparted to Xingdao the Way of the Sun and Moon. She also ingested the *Ninefold Radiant Mirror Flower*, thereby achieving transcendence. Formerly, she had come to reside within Huayang, serving as Vice-Minister of Life-Preservation. The *River Chart* states: \"In Wu and Chu, many have witnessed the Great Peace.\" She would often tell others: \"These words are not empty; this verification will soon come to pass.\" (How can such scholars not redouble their diligence and effort?)\n\nThe preservation of the *Luminous Mirror* is no ordinary worldly method. According to the oral instructions received from Fan Qiulin: \"Master the art of whistling. Let your whistling resemble the mingled cries of a hundred birds, or the wind surging through a forest, or the sound of drums being struck.\" Once, at the Altar of the Celestial Market, she faced north with fervor and let forth a long whistle to summon the wind. In an instant, clouds gathered above, and surging qi stirred the forest. At times, dark mists converged in a whirlwind; at others, a fine rain descended in a mist.\n\nThe Ministry of Life-Preservation has four Vice-Ministers.

      "translated_text": "By the early Song dynasty, Lady Tan, the Princess Dowager of Jing of Changsha, sponsored a Daoist surnamed Chen and established a Daoist residence northwest of Mount Leiping—this is the present Northern Residence. Later, there was Mount Jurong, and Wang Wenqing, as recorded in the annals, became its master. Learning that Magistrate Xu had once built his dwelling here, he extensively consulted the village elders. In the seventh year of the Daming reign, an elderly adept named Xu Ou mentioned that his ancestor had served Magistrate Xu and passed down knowledge that the magistrate’s residence lay just before the present residence, where the tallow trees stood, and that the well before the refectory hall likely remained. At the time, the site was overgrown with weeds and brambles. Wang then cleared the vegetation and searched, indeed discovering a brick well, its mouth nearly filled with earth. He excavated and repaired it, reinforcing it with tiles. Now it holds fine water, slightly white in hue, perhaps the very water earlier described as resembling that outside Phoenix Gate.\n\nThus confirming it as the former residence, which had long lain abandoned, with none daring to dwell there. Since it was said to be the \"golden chamber to the inner room,\" it must have been the most fertile ground for crouching dragons. To its northwest stretches a long ridge, called Mount Long Concealment.\n\nNortheast of Mount Leiping lies another mountain, commonly called Great Horizontal Mountain, though its true name is Mount Yu Ridge. The *Records of Famous Mountains* refers to it as Ridge Mountain. At its foot flows a spring where Li Ming once compounded the elixir of immortality and ascended to the Mystic Continent. The site by the water remains to this day. Due east of this mountain stands the ancient tomb of King Yeyi of Yue. (Originally written as *墓*, later generations changed it to *冢*. The mountain now extends far and wide. The later reference to an ancient immortal compounding the elixir likely refers to this place. Li Ming merely stated it lay in a certain region, so it may have been slightly south of here. No foundation traces remain by the water, perhaps gradually reclaimed by overgrowth.)\n\nKing Yeyi was the fourth-generation descendant of Goujian. Initially refusing to ascend the throne, he fled into a cave on Mount Jing. The people of Yue lured him out, and later, during the Wu dynasty, he was relocated back to Kuaiji. In the eleventh year of King Xuan of Zhou, he was killed by Sun Zhujiu, who was in turn slain by the people of Yue. How his tomb came to be so far away remains unknown—perhaps there was some numinous quality to this place. Though no definitive burial mound has been found, there appears to be a designated funerary precinct.\n\nThe above was spoken by the Lord of the *Dinglu*.\n\n(The following three entries were transcribed by an assistant.)\n\nThe jade inscription of Huayang lies west of Tongchu Prefecture, facing east—or, as some say, on all four sides.

While traveling, he encountered the immortal Zhou Zhengshi, who taught him the Dao of *concealment and preservation*. Assuming the guise of a hat-wearing traveler, he came to dwell in this chamber. He regularly ingested the *solar and lunar essences*, his complexion like jade, appearing no older than thirty. (How could the two masters not know his true name?

      "translated_text": "Cai Tiansheng never spoke ill of others. Once, while traveling to purchase incense, he encountered the River Earl’s daughter. Recognizing her as an extraordinary being, he bowed twice and offered her a full eave’s worth of incense. Moved by his sincerity, she taught him the method of paying homage to the Heavenly Emperor and the Jade Sovereign. Thereby he attained immortality, assuming the form of a staff-bearing recluse, dwelling in seclusion upon Square Terrace. The maiden still visits him to this day, and Tiansheng regards her as his master.\n\nLong Bogao was a man of the Later Han. When the Han general Ma Yuan, the Pacifier of the South, admonished his brother’s son, he praised this man as exemplary and worthy of emulation—this was none other than Bogao. Later, Bogao followed the immortal Daolin of the Knife and received the method of fetal ingestion. He also regularly consumed the *Azure Nourishment* formula. Assuming the guise of a drunken death, he concealed himself upon Square Terrace, becoming a disciple of the Master of the Fixed Record. (Bogao’s given name was Shu. A native of the capital district, he served as Magistrate of Shandu during the *Jianwu* era of the Han, rising to the post of Governor of Lingling. When Ma Yuan campaigned in the south, he wrote to his nephew Yan, saying: “Long Bogao is sincere, circumspect, and prudent, his speech beyond reproach. Modest, frugal, and upright, he is both incorruptible and commanding. I cherish and esteem him; may you and your peers take him as your model. Even if you fail to match Bogao, you will still be a man of caution and restraint—like one who carves a swan but falls short, yet still resembles a duck.”)\n\nTo the northeast of Thunderflat Mountain and the southeast of Constantgood Mountain lies Swallowmouth Mountain, so named for its three small peaks standing in close proximity. It is also called Squarecorner Mountain. In ancient times, men once compounded the Nine-Cauldron Elixir here. The Recluse delighted in dwelling here at that time, and still frequents the place. Beneath Squarecorner Mountain lies a grotto chamber called the Square Source Lodge, which has two entrances often visible from without. These five men now sojourn here together. (This mountain lies southwest of the Great Horizontal. Two earthen mounds, resembling a shield and a dragon, once stood nearby, though their names are no longer known. The earlier mention of Li Ming compounding the elixir refers to this place. The Recluse—after Yuan the Assistant departed the world and wished to conceal his name—took this title. Here, before receiving his official appointment, he paused to cultivate his practice in the grotto lodge. The mountain still has two small entrances, and the five men, including the four from Fourflat Mountain, come and go freely, often gathering together. Thus, when Master Yang dreamed of Yuan the Assistant, he said, “I have just come from Fourflat Mountain.” The six entries above were newly transcribed by hand, having been conveyed by the Master of Life Preservation.)\n\nWithin Deer Track Mountain lies an impassable ravine. The “impassable ravine” is a space of barely one or two *mu*, with no passage leading in or out—hence its name. The grotto chamber is surrounded on all sides by blue-white stone, which naturally radiates light like a silken canopy unfurled. The floor is perfectly level, with stone beds and stone couches of varying lengths, their partitions and divisions as though carved with precision, yet all in perfect order.

He curried favor with the eunuch faction and, when Jin was assassinated, Miao was slain in battle at the Vermilion Bird Gate by Wu Kuang, one of Jin’s generals, and beheaded. Dong Zhuo later exhumed his corpse and dismembered it. Since he did not deliberately employ *bingjie* (liberation through a violent death) to depart, it is unclear how he came to reside here. Their mother was also executed. Moreover, Miao was not born of the same mother as Jin, and their official ranks differed.

Having practiced this for fifty years, they concentrated their minds on inner vision, no longer requiring food or drink. Their bodies became light and strong, their complexions like those of youths. On the twelfth day of the second month of this year, the Supreme Unity dispatched a summons to welcome them. On that very day, they ascended to heaven riding clouds. Now they reside in the Dark Realm, where they have been appointed as Perfected Ones of the Lofty Immortals. Zhang Shisheng was named Earl of the Eastern Source. In Mount Heng, there were Daoist practitioners Zhang Lizheng and Ye Mingqi. Lizheng, having entered the mountains during the late Han, consumed *huangjing*, his complexion remaining robust and youthful, perpetually like that of a man of forty. Mingqi entered the mountains at the end of the Wei and consumed pills of *zexie* and cypress seeds. Together they dwelled in a cave, later both receiving from the Western City Lord Wang the *hongjing* cinnabar formula. They had been consuming this elixir for forty-three years, though they suffered from the scarcity of cinnabar. Both emerged in Guangzhou, becoming Buddhist monks during the tenure of Teng Han as Prefect. Thereupon they attained inner and outer clarity, their eyes bright and bodies light, able to travel five hundred *li* in a day. They also practiced *shouyi*, having maintained this for thirty years. On the first day of the third month, the Eastern Florescence dispatched a summons to welcome them. On that very day, they ascended to heaven riding clouds.

Often, he came to the capital’s markets to purchase cinnabar, from which he refined the *Nine-Flowered Elixir*. Upon completing the elixir, a single dose was taken, and the Supreme Unity Dao Lord dispatched an envoy on the seventeenth day of the sixth month this year to welcome him.

Some, though unwilling to ascend as immortals, remain for long ages in the Five Peaks and famous mountains—their number is likewise beyond reckoning. Others serve as immortal officials, charged with overseeing the sacred mountains, and these, too, number in the thousands.\n\nOn the twentieth night of the ninth month, the *Record of the Pure Numinous* was issued.

Later, he committed an offense and fled into hiding, remaining concealed for two months without emerging. He encountered Master Zheng, who saved and delivered all beings, exhorting him with the Dharma. Jing then followed Zheng, carrying his eaves and tending to his needs for seven years without敢懈怠. He received the essentials of Daoist guiding and pulling, consuming mountain yam and poria. He attained a lifespan of three hundred years. Later, on Tianwei Mountain, Master Red Pine descended to transmit the true Dao to both of them. Now, he resides in the cavern of Dayou as a Perfected One.\n\nFan Boci was a man of Guiyang. His family originally followed worldly customs, but he suddenly fell into madness and evil influences, contracting a consumptive illness that confined him to his bed for over a year. His family invited physicians and expended their wealth, yet his condition remained incurable. Hearing that the Great Dao was pure and required no offerings, his resolve shifted. Learning of Shen Jing’s diligent cultivation as a Daoist and his efficacy in healing, he abandoned worldly affairs to follow him. After fifty days, all his ailments were cured. Later, he sought out Lu Wanzhi to receive the true inner Dao. Wanzhi could not enter the mountains, but Boci, discontent with the world, bid farewell and entered Tianmu Mountain. There, he consumed sesame and cultivated with focused intent for seventeen years. The Perfected Lord of the Great Cavern and Controller of Destiny descended to transmit the thirty-six-scroll scripture. Later, he ingested the returning elixir and ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Now, he is the Perfected One of Mysterious Unity.\n\n*(The passages marked \"云云\" were omitted by the copyist, not due to any lacuna in the original.

      "translated_text": "Crossing the Qinzhou Reedy Waters, he was detained and drowned, his body recovered and buried by the riverbank. This is present-day Qinchuan in Nanzheng. This man was also an inner-chamber disciple of Jizhu. (Upon examining these four individuals, all employed the arts of the Spirit Pellet and miscellaneous liberations.)\n\nJizhu had one son and one daughter, both of whom attained the Dao. The son was named Fayu, and the daughter was named Jihua. Both now reside within Mount Weiyu. Jihua is presently reciting the Thirty-Nine Chapters, though she has yet to complete them. (This principle is also difficult to expound in detail.)\n\nJizhu recited the Jade Scripture and ingested the essence of Bright Cinnabar. His hands cradled the radiance of dawn, and his complexion today remains that of a twenty-year-old maiden. His beard measures three feet in length, black as ink. Yesterday, the Eastern Minister recounted this, just as I have set it down—truly a wondrous affair. Yet I know not how it may truly be. (This line was recorded by Master Yang in a letter to the Prefectural Governor. The phrase of uncertainty may indicate another meaning.)\n\nJizhu relinquished his form and concealed his light, hiding his traces in Mount Weiyu. The *Purple Yang Tradition* fully records these matters. Last night, the Eastern Minister arrived, and I ventured to inquire about Jizhu’s origins and later years. The Eastern Minister responded, instructing me to set it down separately, as presented above. I hope you will not take offense. Once read, consign it to the flames. (This is Master Yang’s letter to the Prefectural Governor. The *Biographies of Perfected Transcendents* compiled by Zhou Jun of present times records Jizhu’s affairs only briefly. No other authentic handwritten account has been seen. Judging by these words, it appears to be incorrect. It seems there was a preceding annotation, but one line is now missing.)\n\nWhat follows is the record of the Sagely Master Li. In general, it aligns with the foregoing, though the Eastern Minister has additionally provided annotations. The annotations approach ten thousand characters—a most extraordinary work. Recently, we have discussed many matters of divine transformation, and Jizhu’s case was briefly mentioned. Last month, I was further entrusted with the *Commentary on the Scripture of the Divine Tiger*. The commentary is unlike anything heard in the world, and I myself do not yet grasp its purport. Should I learn of others like Jizhu, I shall certainly report it in confidence. (This is also Master Yang’s letter to the Prefectural Governor. Since it concerns Jizhu’s affairs, I have placed it in sequence here rather than appending it to the lower scroll. The Prefectural Governor, compiling the *Biographies of Perfected Transcendents*, wished to place Jizhu first. Thus, Master Yang sought to inquire about his origins and later years. The two scriptures annotated by the Director of Destinies have yet to be revealed to the world.)\n\nThe above ten entries contain Yang’s writings.

When the Hundred Six kalpa approaches, the waters of Yang Perpetuity Mountain recede, while those of Yin Completeness Mountain rise. When the Yang Nine kalpa approaches, the waters of Yin Completeness recede, while those of Yang Perpetuity rise. Recently, it has been the turn of Yin Completeness, and its waters have already risen nine thousand *zhang* above the mountain’s base. The arrival of the Hundred Six kalpa is not far off. (When the water’s edge of Yin Completeness emerges so high above the mountain, this should correspond to the Yang Nine kalpa, yet it is spoken of as the Hundred Six—this may be a misstatement. Alternatively, it could mean the water’s rise has reached such a height, not that the water first receded. Yet water seeks its own level and is not swift or turbulent. The two mountains are not far apart; how could one stand so abruptly isolated?)\n\nThe following two entries were transcribed by the Senior Scribe: Before reaching the first high mountain west of the temple, at the northern end of Dragon’s Tail, there is a great spring. It bursts forth from the earth, over six *zhang* in length and five *zhang* in width, penetrating six *chi* into the ground. Its flow strikes the earth for over two hundred *bu* before diverging three *li* from the road. Opposite the second high mountain west of the temple’s rear, there is another great spring. It emerges from the earth, over four *zhang* in length and three *chi* in width, penetrating four *chi* into the ground. Its force scours the earth for over three hundred *bu* before diverging two *li* from the road. Near the temple’s rear flank, there is yet another great spring. It issues from the earth, over five *zhang* in length and four *zhang* in width, penetrating slightly over two *chi* into the ground. Its flow converges inward, one hundred fifty *bu* from the temple.\n\nNorth of Jiang Mountain, there are three such erupting springs, their currents flowing northwest. These three entries record strange phenomena, yet as no eyewitness account exists, their veracity remains uncertain. It is also unknown when these eruptions occurred.

Beneath it lies a grotto-heaven, fifteen thousand *li* in circumference. Above and below, there are palaces of spirits and gods. On the mountain stand six palaces, and within the grotto are six more, each spanning a thousand *li* in circumference. These are the palaces of the Six Heavens’ spirits and gods.

      "translated_text": "At times, it resembles passing through city gates where documents are inspected—likely all occurring within the outer palaces atop this mountain. As with Humu Ban’s journey to the Lord of Mount Tai’s abode, one may unknowingly enter the grotto. Perhaps ghosts and spirits are illusory, preventing mortals from perceiving the truth.\n\nThose among the living who know the names of the Six Heavenly Palace Gates need only recite them thrice while facing north before sleep, in a low voice, and the hundred ghosts will not dare to harm them. (Earlier, they were called palace names; now, gate names. The gates derive their names from the palaces. The palaces are but empty titles, while the gates bear inscribed placards visible to all ghosts—and now to mortals as well, which is why they submit in awe.)\n\nThe incantation goes:\n*\"I am a disciple of the Most High, governing the Six Heavens below. The Six Heavenly Palaces are under my command—not only under my command, but under the authority of the Most High. I know the names of the Six Heavenly Palaces, and thus I attain longevity. Should any dare to transgress, the Most High shall sever your form.\"*\n\n(Here, \"governing the Six Heavens below\" means they are not governed by the Six Heavens. Not only do I command them myself, but the Most High has ordered me to oversee them, thus reinforcing my authority—much like officials in commanderies and counties who receive imperial appointments, not mere blank commissions.)\n\nThe first palace is named the *Zhoujue Yintian Palace*. Proceeding eastward in order, the second palace is named— (These two characters in Yang Jun’s manuscript appear at the bottom of the page, but the copyist, unfamiliar with them, rendered them as seven characters. All contemporary versions mistakenly list this as the seventh palace. This is an error, for there are only six palaces—how could there be seven? The incantation’s phrase \"proceeding eastward in order\" is meant to astonish the ghosts by demonstrating knowledge of their sequential positions.)\n\nContinuing in this manner through the sixth palace, one then taps the teeth six times before lying down, to ward off the qi of malevolent ghosts. (After reciting the incantation once and tapping the teeth six times, the process is repeated twice more before sleep.)\n\n(This method has already been transcribed in detail in the third chapter on cultivation practices.)\n\nWhen a person first dies, they all proceed to the *Zhoujue Yintian Palace* to receive their fate. Some may first go to famous mountains, Mount Tai, or rivers, but they do not necessarily go directly to the first heaven. Only on the day of their judgment—when their sins are examined and their fortune determined—must they come to this first heavenly palace. (This palace is governed by the Northern Emperor, and all matters must ultimately pass through it—like prefectural and county prisons, which, though initially under local jurisdiction, must eventually be sent to the capital for final sentencing.)\n\nThe *Tailiang Shizong Tian Palace* and its attendant ghosts constitute the second heaven.

Fan Shusheng was a native of Beidi and later served as *Huangmen Lang* under Emperor Wen of Wei. Li Boshan was the father of Li Chong, who had been *Ling* of Baima during the Han and practiced hidden virtues. Some inherit the Dao across generations, their virtue accumulating through the ages—such was the case with these two prefectures’ transcendents, who advanced step by step to enter this rank.\n\nXiang Liangcheng composed the *Palace Chant*, which reads:\n*\"Zhou’s end severed the imperial dawn,\nIn truth, affairs entangled in layered deceit.\nFlaming as smoke in the vault of heaven,\nBursting like radiant brilliance.\nWuyang girds the divine blade,\nSerene and luminous, swallowing the Azure River.\nThe gates of Chang swing open to the cinnabar well,\nCloud gates rise in towering majesty.\nSeven wrongs traverse the wondrous canopy,\nLinked bends spread their enchantments.\nSix heavens bar the northern path—\nThis is the domain of ghosts and spirits.\"*\n\nThe chant comprises twenty thousand words; here, only the names of the Six Heavenly Palaces are excerpted.

Yet while the Duke of Zhou’s contributions were unparalleled, among the ranks of immortals and ghosts, none of his deeds stand prominently recorded. The Grand Duke, wielding the battle-axe and staff, enforced punishments with the greatest severity, yet he appears in the *Arrayed Transcendents*. Duke Shao’s virtue flowed like the sweet pear, yet he was instead appointed to a chief ghostly office—such matters remain difficult to fathom. All must stem from the karmic roots of their respective destinies.

Examining these lords, their promotions have been irregular, for the Dao shifts with the times in its employment of persons.

He was well-versed in learning and possessed eloquence and logical reasoning. He assisted the **Jìn** (晋) dynasty’s establishment. Beginning from a lowly position, he became a **Huángmén Láng** (黄门郎), then successively held the offices of **Shàngshū Púshè** (尚书仆射), **Sìkōng** (司空), **Tàiyè** (太尉), and **Tàifù** (太傅). He passed away in the tenth year of the **Tàishǐ** (太始) era, at the age of seventy, and was posthumously honored as **Kāng Gōng** (康公). According to **Sū Yáo** (苏韶)'s *Transmission* (传云), **Liú Kǒngcái** (刘孔才) served as **Tàishān Gōng** (太山公) and plotted to rebel against the **Northern Dì** (北帝). He was later executed and eradicated. **Kǒngcái** (孔才) was none other than **Liú Shào** (刘邵).\n\nAdditionally, **Méi Yí** (梅颐) held the post of **Yùzhāng Tàishǒu** (豫章太守). In a dream, he was summoned to serve as **Tàishān Fǔjūn** (太山府君). Upon waking, he died shortly thereafter. It remains unclear whether these two positions were distinct from that of **Tàishān Jūn** (太山君).\n\nIt is also said that there existed a **Tàishān Lìng** (太山令), commanding a force of ten thousand soldiers to garrison a location—such garrisons numbered several hundred in total. Some commanded garrisons of several thousand soldiers, all subordinate to one another. Each had a **Chángshǐ** (长史) and **Sīmǎ** (司马).\n\n**Wáng Wéndù** (王文度) was stationed in **Guǎnglíng** (广陵). Suddenly, he saw a soldier appear and summon him, saying, *\"You are to be appointed as **Píngběi Jiāngjūn** (平北将军) and **Sìshǐ** (刺史) of **Xú** (徐) and **Dài** (兖) states.\"* **Wáng** (王) replied, *\"I have already been appointed to this office.\"* The soldier said, *\"This is a celestial appointment.\"* In a short while, the soldier vanished, and soon afterward, **Wáng** was led away and died.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** (天地间事理) of existence transcends human understanding and cannot be fathomed by mere conjecture. Even in the unseen and visible realms, there are three categories: **xiān** (仙, the celestial), **rén** (人, the human), and **guǐ** (鬼, the spectral). Those who cultivate virtue may ascend to become **xiān** (celestial beings). Those who are exiled from the celestial realm may reincarnate as humans. The wicked among humans may descend to become **guǐ** (spectral beings). The fortunate among **guǐ** may return to human form. **Guǐ** (spectral beings) emulate humans, while humans emulate **xiān** (celestial beings). This cyclical transformation follows patterns, with each category mirroring the others in kind.

For instance, **Xún Zhōnghóu** (荀中侯) was mentioned without a surname, yet later it was clarified—perhaps to distinguish him from others. The individuals discussed are mostly from recent times, likely due to the **transformation and variation** (代谢参差) of their **karmic records** (亿识), as well as the ease of recognizing those from the **Three Dynasties** (三代). Yet, the **Two Hán**, **Wéi**, and **Jìn** dynasties indeed had many talented and renowned figures, such as **Liú Xiàng** (刘向), **Dòng Zhòngshū** (董仲舒), **Yáng Xióng** (扬雄), **Zhāng Héng** (张衡), **Cài Xuān** (蔡川), **Zhèng Xuán** (郑玄), **Wáng Bì** (王弼), and **Ruǎn Qǐshān** (阮稽山) and their peers.

Thus, they likely do not belong to the **Three Officials** (三官) but may instead be **assigned to Daoist/Immortal duties** (仙家驱任).\n\nIn the earlier discussion of **emperors and kings** (帝王), their posthumous status was also uneven. **Wéi Wén** (魏文) and **Jìn Wǔ** (晋武), though **Mandated Sovereigns** (受命之主), did not attain prominence. Conversely, **Wéi Wǔ** (魏武) and **Jìn Xuān** (晋宣) were celebrated, while **Sūn Quán** (孙权) should be ranked alongside **Liú Bèi** (刘备), yet neither was recorded in the **Celestial Strategies** (道策). These discrepancies arise from the **foundations of their earthly kingdoms** (启国之基) and the **joyous acknowledgment of their great achievements** (功高乐推). As for those who merely **inherited the throne and upheld the traditions** (继体守文之君), none were recognized.\n\nThe following two sections were recorded as per the **emperor’s decree** (受旨), all by **Yáng Jūn** (杨君).

Though the prefectures and governorships sought to recruit him, he never lowered himself to accept. He wandered the mountains and forests, abandoning worldly affairs and dust, his aspirations aligned with those of **Yú Jìn** (子晋) under **Sīhóu** (丝侯) and **Zēn** (岑), and his companionship with **Língyáng** (陵阳) in **Bù Xuán** (步玄). Thus, he changed his name to **Yuànzǐ** (玄子) and took **Yánqī** (延期) as his courtesy name.\n\nHe did not foresee that his ancestors had committed many transgressions, bringing calamity upon their descendants. He was ensnared by imperial edicts, his fate sealed by later generations, and his life did not last long—he perished at the **Chángliáng Ferry** (长梁之津). The **Western Queen Mother** (西王母) observed his arduous cultivation; the **Heavenly Sovereign of the Northern Dipper** (都北帝) pitied his **Dao-heart** (道心) and instructed the **Office of Fate** (司命) to send decrees to the **Three Officials** (三官), commanding them to seize his corporeal form, return his soul to its true nature, and grant him rebirth. Thus, he was endowed with **spiritual essence** (胎神), attaining the rank of **Língshén** (灵神). Over two hundred years have passed since then.\n\n(His death by drowning mirrors that of **Wang Yǎn’s daughter** (王衍之女), and it is feared that this corporeal form may never again be reborn, as it is but a **retrograde essence** (反质) and **spiritual embryo** (胎神).

The **Central Protector** is an office akin to that of the **Grand Tutor of the Realm [世太傅]**. However, **Yōu Bùpíng [攸不平]** was seated in selection—his promotion was unjust. He was demoted to **Central Guardian [中护]**, equivalent to the rank of **Minor Tutor [少傅]**.\n\n(Zhou originally held the post of **Marshal of Destiny [司命帅]**. He should have been succeeded by **Chéng Xí [程遐]** before being transferred to this office. **Yōu Bùpíng**, styled **Bódào [伯道]**, was from **Xiangling, Pingyang [平阳襄陵]**. He served under the Jin as **Master of the Imperial Heir’s Attendants [太子洗马]**, **Minister of Personnel [吏部郎]**, and **Governor of Hedong [河东太守]**. He was captured by **Shí Lè [石勒]** but later returned to the east, becoming **Governor of Wujun [吴郡太守]** and **Minister of Personnel [吏部尚书]**. He died of illness in the first year of **Xiánhé [咸和]**, aged forty-seven, and was posthumously honored as **Lord of Light [光禄]**. When **Yōu Bùpíng** returned from rebellion with the Hu, he abandoned his own son and brought only his younger brother’s child across the river. Thus, he had no descendants, leaving no heirs. **Xiè Àn [谢安]** sighed, *\"Heaven’s ways are inscrutable—why did **Yōu Bódào [攸伯道]** have no son?\"*\n\nThe above is what **Xīn Xuánzǐ [辛玄子]** spoke of—his accounts of the **Netherworld [冥中]** are numerous. Here, I have only roughly recorded the **fragmentary [鹿鹿鹿]** portions, without elaborating further. (Though this record is from **Xuánzǐ’s** teachings, it also includes words from **Yang Jun [杨君]**. Yang’s original text is lost, and only a copyist’s draft remains. The manuscript was later partially cut away, so the accounts may not be entirely complete.)\n\nThose of **utter loyalty and filial piety**, upon death, receive the **Scripture [书]** to become **Netherworld Rulers [地下主]**. After **one hundred and forty years**, they are granted instruction in **Lower Dao [下仙之教]** and taught the **Great Way [大道]**. From then on, they gradually ascend, eventually **supplementing the ranks of the Immortals [补仙官]**. After another **one hundred and forty years**, they are permitted a **trial advancement [试进]**. (These **Netherworld Rulers** are the same as those recorded in the **Cavern Texts [洞中所记]**—such as **Lǐ [李] (East)**—not separate ghostly officials appointed anew. Each **one hundred and forty years** marks a promotion to the next rank, where they serve as **Immortal Envoys [仙人使]**, only then beginning to receive Daoist teachings.)\n\nThe **filially pious** can move **ghosts and spirits**, causing **birds and beasts of the mountains** to guard their tombs **[巡其坟土延]**. The **utterly loyal** act with **unwavering rectitude**, their **essence piercing the sun [精贯白日]**, or even **severing their own bodies** to inspire their rulers. **Bǐ Gān [比干]** now resides at **Róngshān [戎山]**, while **Lǐ Shàn [李善]** is at **Shàoshì [少室]**. Many have undergone such **transmutations [变鍊]**, but these two serve as examples. (Bǐ Gān’s **severed heart** exemplifies **utter loyalty**, while accounts of filial sons moving spirits are also numerous.

*Jiǎzǐ* [甲子],\nthe first day of the month, *Xīnhài* [辛亥] at the new moon.\n(Though the auspicious date could be used to honor *Xian Nong*)\nOn the fourth day, *Jiǎyín* [甲寅], *Yǔshuǐ* [羽水] descended.\n(Within the first month, *Yǔ* [羽] means rain.)\n\n*Qǐ* [起] is *Xīng* [兴], *An* [安] is *Níng* [宁].\nThus, the name is veiled in ambiguity.\nTherefore, by the *Xīngníng* [兴宁] year’s first month,\nthe *Nán Zhēn* [南真] had already descended and granted the *Yáng Jūn* [杨君] the scriptures.\n\nNow, examining the records of the *Zhēnshòu* [真授],\nthe earliest year and month are:\nthe *Yǐchǒu* [乙丑] year, sixth month, twenty-first day,\nwhen the *Dìnglù* [定录] was granted the inquiry.\nFrom this month and day onward,\nthere were gradual descents and transmissions.\n\nFurthermore, the *Zhōngshǐ* [中侍] *Fūrén* [夫人] revealed:\n*\"Let the bamboo slips be planted beside the northern lodgings,\nto bring forth successors.\"*\nShe also said:\n*\"The *Fúhé* [福和] will bear two sons,\nwith great virtue destined to rule the world.\"*\n\nThis was during the time when *Jiǎnwén* [简文] was the *Xiàngwáng* [相王],\nand due to his lack of sons, he made the request.\nThus, *Lǐ Fūrén* [李夫人] bore the *Xiàowǔ* [孝武] and the *Guìjì Wáng* [会稽王].\n\nWhen *Xiàowǔ* [孝武] passed away at age thirty-five,\nit was in the *Rénxū* [壬戌] year,\ntwo years before *Jiǎzǐ* [甲子].\nThus, the *Zhēnshòu* [众真] had long been descending upon *Yáng Jūn* [杨君].\n\nAgain, in the *Yǐchǒu* [乙丑] year, sixth month,\nthe *Dìnglù* [定录] likened the scriptures to *Yáng Jūn* [杨君],\nsaying: *\"I once obtained the writings of the previous year,\nthe eighth day of the third month.\"*\nThis should also be the *Guǐhài Jiǎzǐ* [癸亥甲子] year.\n\nMoreover, *Yìng Lǜ* [愕绿华] descended in the *Shēngpíng* [升平] year,\nwhich was the *Jīwǔ* [己未] year,\nfive years before *Jiǎzǐ* [甲子].\nThough this descent was not for *Yáng Jūn* [杨君],\n*Yáng Jūn* [杨君] knew of it and recorded it.\n\nIn the *Yǐchǒu* [乙丑] year,\nthe *Ān Fēi* [安妃] told *Yáng Jūn* [杨君]:\n*\"In twenty-two years,\na worthy ruler will ascend to the clouds and ride the dragon.\nThe *Shàngqīng* [上清] of the Northern Court\nshould be marked by the *Tàiyuán* [太元] year, *Dīngxū* [丙戌].\"*\n\nThus, over twenty years of recorded transmissions,\nmany matters were not fully accounted for.\nWhat remains today is but a few years.\nUpon examining the beginning and end,\nnot a single detail is omitted.\n\nBefore the *Zhēnshòu* [众真] descended upon *Yáng Jūn* [杨君],\nthey had already commanded *Huá Jiào* [华侨] to transmit the *Yīnyì* [音意].\n*Huá Jiào* [华侨] having been

bearing and refined talent,\ntheir nature was incompatible with the *Shìjì* [世迹].\nThus, they did not attain the *Zhēnshòu* [真授].\nMost of what was transmitted\nwas established for *Èr Xū* [二许],\nall decreed by *Yáng Jūn* [杨君].\nThe *Shū* [疏] were shown to *Èr Xū* [二许].\nOnly the *Ān Fēi*’s [安妃] few records were *Yáng Jūn*’s [杨君] own.\n\nNow, when people see the titles:\n*\"On such a day, such a month, such a lord [口受] granted to *Èr Xū* [二许] and *Yòu Yǐng* [右掾]...\"*\nThey claim it was *Èr Xū* [二许] who personally received the *Yīnyì* [音旨].\nThis is far from the truth.\n\nThe books written by *Èr Xū* [二许]\nare all copies of what *Yáng Jūn* [杨君] instructed them.\n\nMoreover, *Yòu Yǐng* [右掾] recorded:\n*\"In the *Tàihé* [泰和] year, I practiced the *Dào* [道].\nThe two *Lù* [录] were received in the second year.\nAfter the third year,\nthere were no further *Shū* [疏].\"*\n\nThe *Zhōngshǐ*’s [中侍] calligraphy was not skilled,\nand his transcriptions were few.\nToday, one matter may have two or three versions,\nall being *Èr Xū*’s [二许] repeated copies,\nwith no discrepancies.\nYet *Yáng Jūn*’s [杨君] writings all lack duplicates,\nclearly indicating that only *Yòu Yǐng*’s [右掾] records were preserved.\n*Yáng Jūn*’s [杨君] own records have vanished beyond measure.\n\nAfter *Yáng Jūn* [杨君] departed, six or seven years passed,\nbut no traces of the *Zhōngshǐ* [长史] emerged.\n\nRegarding the recorded years and months today,\nthe *Yǐchǒu* [乙丑] year has the most entries,\nwhile the *Dǐngyín* [丙寅] and *Dīngwǔ* [丁卯] years each have several.\nThe first volume still retains some semblance of order,\nbut the remaining volumes have dates and events jumbled,\nnot fully aligned in sequence.\n\nAs for the recorded dates of transmissions,\nmost do not specify the year.\nI have now arranged them sequentially,\nassuming their order based on precedence.\nSome matters are interrupted,\nbut not all must be accounted for.\nWhen no year or month is recorded,\nor when the recipient is not specified,\nthey are left as originally omitted.\n\nThe *Zhēnshòu* [真授]’s teachings on others’ likes and dislikes\nwere all inquiries made by the *Zhōngshǐ* [长史] on behalf of *Yáng Jūn* [杨君],\nand the answers were given accordingly.\nThey were kept secret within *Èr Xū*’s [二许] circle,\nand at that time, not all were necessarily aware.\n\nMoreover, *Bìng Jǐn* [并衿] received the *Jǐngyáng Ān* [景阳安],\nwhich was clearly and distinctly explained.\nAll the poems of *Xīng* [兴] with or without waiting,\nas well as the *Cí* [辞], *Yù* [喻], *Fěng* [讽], and *Zhǐ* [旨],\nwere all descended by *Yúnlín* [云林] upon the *Pínxiān Hòu* [嫔仙侯].\nTheir meaning and purpose were also manifest.\nThe *Nán Zhēn* [南真] was the teacher who instructed,\nwhile *Zǐwēi* [紫微] was the artisan of the lower teachings.\nThey were not bound by the *Liǔjié* [俦结] rules.\nHowever, *Zhōnghòu Zhāolíng* [中侯昭灵] seemed to have a separate domain.\nSince the matters were not all from one time,\nthe records are not entirely precise.\n\nThe other male *Zhēn* [真]\neither accompanied or were assigned by those cited,\nsuch as the two *Jūn* [君].\nThey were the primary leaders.\nIf people read these transmissions\nwithout understanding this principle,\nthey will never grasp their true meaning.\nHence, I briefly mark the general intent,\nwhich should be kept in strict confidence.\n\n*Èr Xū* [二许] should have been practicing the scriptural arts.\nSince they did not attain the *Zhēnshòu* [真授],\nthey had no way to see the scriptures.\nThus, the *Nán Zhēn* [南真] first instructed *Yáng Jūn* [杨君],\nthen ordered him to transmit.\nThe transmission then became the teacher.\nThat is why the *Zhōngshǐ* [长史] and *Yòu Yǐng* [右英] wrote:\n*\"The *Nán Zhēn* [南真] in pity,\nlast spring sent the teacher to instruct in the *Dòngfáng* [洞房].\"*\nYet *Èr Xū* [二许] were separated by worldly conventions\nand did not revere or respect the teachings.",

      "translated_text": "Lóu Cóng initially, together with **Gù Huān**, **Qī Jǐng Xuán**, **Zhū Sēng Biāo**, and several others, jointly examined and assessed the scriptures. Gù had already copied some of the scriptures kept by Lóu, and though he only roughly recognized the true scriptures, they were still selected and sorted. In total, there were four or five volumes of *jīng* and *zhuàn*, and seven or eight *zhēn* (transmitted orally) texts. Some of these still remain in Dú Jūshì’s household. (The two volumes of *jīng* and the *zhēn* (transmitted orally) texts have already been returned to the Sealed Bright Platform.)\n\nIn the late years of the **Sòng Dàmíng** era, **Dài Fǎxīng**, elder brother of **Yán Xīng**, served as county magistrate and was also fond of the Dao. Along with the celestial masters of **Tiānmù Shān** in **Wúxīng**, he also obtained many copies of Dú’s scriptures. Lóu Cóng’s younger brother, **Dào Jì**, and **Fǎ Zhēn**, along with **Zhōng Xīng’s** daughter **Fù Guāng**, all obtained copies of the scriptures from Lóu and Zhōng. Though they exchanged them freely, none could perfectly replicate the originals, yet they often embellished and refined them, making the calligraphy smooth and elegant—utterly devoid of rigid structure or sharp edges. Their copied scriptures were also rife with errors.\n\nBy the year **Gēngwǔ**, the hidden retreat entered the Dao of **Dōngyáng**. Later scholars gradually refined their craft. **Pán Wén Shèng** of **Shānyīn**, **Dú Gāoshì** of **Jiǎngtáng**, **Jiǎng Hóngsù** of **Yìxīng**, and **Xǔ Língzhēn** of **Jùróng** were all skilled in this art. Though people today admire the calligraphy of the \"Two Wangs,\" they fail to recognize the true scriptures. The authenticity of the scriptures stems from the hidden retreat’s hand—there is no need for all to be filled in by **Guō** (i.e., meticulously traced). A single stroke captures the essence, and the power nearly equals the original. As for the seals, regardless of size, they should all be filled in accordingly.\n\nThis ended in the **Qín Tài** era’s fourth year, when the scriptures were moved back to **Shǐníng Shān**. **Mǎ Zhìwǎn**, under pressure from the monks, converted to Buddhism and handed over dozens of Daoist scriptures to Zhōng—all of which **Hé Gōng** had originally written for his father. There were also miscellaneous scriptures by **Wáng Língqī**, but only four or five volumes and six or seven *zhēn* (transmitted orally) texts were in the true handwriting, unrelated to what Lóu had obtained. (The two volumes of scriptures, including the *zhēn* (transmitted orally) texts, have all been returned to the Sealed Bright Platform.

According to careful examination, **Xǔ Chángshǐ**’s sixth-generation ancestor was named Guāng, with the courtesy name Shǎozhāng. He was the fifth son of **Sītú Xǔ Jìng**. During the reign of Emperor Líng, his elder brother Xùn and Xùn’s son Xiàng both sought favor with the eunuchs and prospered in their power. Guāng feared calamity and, in the year **Yōngjiàn** of **Zhōngpíng** (Middle Peace), *i.e.*, the second year of **Zhōngpíng** (184 CE), he crossed the Yangtze River and settled in **Jùróng County**, **Dānyáng**, within **Dūxiāng**’s **Jíyáng Lí**.

However, upon checking the genealogical records, the seventh-generation ancestor’s name was **Jìng**, with the courtesy name **Hóngqīng**. During the **Hòuhàn** (Later Han) reign of Emperor Āndì, he held the post of **Guānglù** (Illustrious Official). In **Yǒngjiàn** (Eternal Construction) Year 1 of Emperor Shùndì, he was appointed **Sītú** (Grand Tutor). His name and courtesy name differ from the **True Annals**; the reason for this discrepancy remains unclear.\n\nIn **Yǒngchū** (Eternal Beginning) Years 2 and 3 of **Āndì**’s reign, there was a great famine. A *dòu* (peck) of rice cost 2,000 *wén* (copper cash), and people resorted to cannibalism. If **Zhào** indeed saved and revived 480 people, as the **True Annals** claim, it must have been during this time.\n\nAccording to the **Hàn** (Han) dynastic **Gūnyí** (Official Rites), as recorded in **Cuī Yùhuàn’s** (Cui Yuhuan’s) memorial, **Xǔ Jìng** was over a hundred years old yet still held his official position. Thus, not only did his **yīndé** (shady virtue) benefit future generations, but his **zìyáng** (self-illuminating merit) also left a lasting mark upon the world.

The **Jiànwén Diàndà** (i.e., **Emperor Mu of Jin**) long held him in esteem, and he formed many bonds with contemporary sages and scholars.

He served as both the district **Zhǔmù** and **Gōngcáo**. At the age of seventy-four, he died. He had four sons and grandsons, all of whom died early. Thus, there were no descendants left.\n\nThe younger son was named **Suìyǔ**, with the courtesy name **Dàoxiáng**. His diminutive was **Yùfǔ**. He was born of a proper wife. From his youth, he displayed the uprightness of **jī** and **zhāng** (i.e., the virtues of integrity and nobility). The **Zhǔngshǐ** (i.e., **Prefect of a Commandery**) admired his talent, and he was recommended as **Shàngjì Yuàn** (i.e., **Assistant Superintendent of Finance**), **Zhǔmù**, and **Gōngcáo**, though he never took up these offices. He was of refined and luminous bearing, yet he shunned worldly affairs like chaff and husks. Dwelling beneath **Léipíng Shān** (i.e., **Mountain of Tranquility**), he devoted himself diligently to his studies, always wishing to retire early to the **Dòngshì** (i.e., **Hollow Chamber**, a Daoist term for the body after death or the state of transcendence). He did not desire to linger long in the mortal world.\n\nHe then went to **Běidòng** (i.e., **Northern Grotto**) and declared his intent to depart.

Hence, **Zhēnshì** (i.e., **True Edict**) said: *\"The recluse, while alive, always took joy in dwelling here.\"* And **Yáng Jūn** wrote in his letter to the **Zhǔngshǐ**: *\"I do not know if the recluse in **Fāngyú Shān** has already set aside a seat for me in a dwelling that is easy to move to.\"* After his death, sixteen years later, in the year **Dīngmǎo** of **Tàihé**, he was promoted to **Shàngqīng Xiān Gōng** (i.e., **High Clarity Daoist Official**) and **Shàngxiàng Dìchén** (i.e., **Supreme Attendant of the Imperial Court**). According to the records, he was thirty years old at the time, though he did not remember the year of his passing.\n\nCross-referencing the two registers, in the year **Dīngmǎo** of **Tàihé** (i.e., **Tàihé’s second year**), he was twenty-seven. Thus, he was born in the year **Xīnmǎo** of **Xiánníng’s seventh year**. (As **Gù** said: *\"He was born in the sixth year of Xiánhé. Again, it is said that the **Sītú** (i.e., **Grand Tutor**) appointed him as **Yuàn**, but this was not true.\"*)\n\nFrom the third year of **Tàihé** onward, there were no further traces of him.
