Those who received them were granted the Upper Kitchen, with twenty-four worthy ones to partake in the feast.\n\nTo the left: the Balanced Qi of the First, Yangping and Lutang;\nTo the right: the Balanced Qi.\nTo the left: the Senior Qi of the Second, Heming and Liyuan;\nTo the right: the Senior Qi.\nTo the left: the Metropolitan Overseer of the Third, Gegui and Gengchu;\nTo the right: the Metropolitan Overseer.\nTo the left: the Divine Overseer of the Fourth, Qinzhong and Zhenduo;\nTo the right: the Divine Overseer.\nTo the left: the Metropolitan Supervisor of the Fifth, Changli and Lishang;\nTo the right: the Metropolitan Supervisor.\nTo the left: the Divine Supervisor of the Sixth, Yongquan and Jushan;\nTo the right: the Divine Supervisor.\nTo the left: the Inspector of the Seventh, Choujing and Benzhu;\nTo the right: the Inspector.\nTo the left: the Merit Overseer of the Eighth, Mengqin and Pinggai;\nTo the right: the Merit Overseer.\nTo the left: the Merit Supervisor of the Ninth, Yuntai and Jinkou;\nTo the right: the Merit Supervisor.\nTo the left: the Metropolitan Qi of the Tenth, Houcheng and Gongmu;\nTo the right: the Metropolitan Qi.\nTo the left: the Tribute Qi of the Eleventh, Pinggang and Zhubu;\nTo the right: the Tribute Qi.\nTo the left: the Inspecting Qi of the Twelfth, Yuju and Beimang;\nTo the right: the Inspecting Qi.\n\nThe twenty-four qi officials of the Yin-Yang Libationer ranks were conferred upon Daoling on the same day. The qi had only two original versions, with *Wan Tong* as above, while the remaining three versions followed the Senior Qi onward, each disordered and impossible to collate. Now, *Wan Tong* is deemed correct, and thus marked in red to clarify the sequence, each paired with its respective abbey in order.\n\nAt the conclusion of this, the Yin names pertain to women, and the Yang titles to men. Men occupy the left Balanced Qi, women the right Balanced Qi. The accumulation of old conflicts in transmission has led to this origin—how could it be otherwise? As the *Official Rites* states: the twenty-four qi of men and women make clear that men and women share these twelve, doubled left and right to form twenty-four. The evidence is sound; there should be no doubt.\n\nSome say: Yangping is assigned to the left, Lutang to the right—how could a man receive Lutang without a Yin name, or a woman bear Yangping, usurping a male title? Such reasoning is decisively incorrect; other texts follow this pattern.\n\n1. **Ganghu Abbey**\n\nThe Master of Fire governs the Upper Realm of the Starry Lodge, located within the boundaries of Hanyang County.\n\n**2. Baishi Abbey**\nThe Master of Metal governs the Upper Realm of Zhang Lodge, located within the boundaries of Hanyang County.\n\n**3. Zhongmao Abbey**\nThe Master of Water governs the Upper Realm of Yi Lodge, located within the boundaries of Fukou County.\n\n**4. Jushan Abbey**\nThe Master of Earth governs the Upper Realm of Han Lodge, located within the boundaries of Guangyang County.\n\nIn the third year of Jian’an, the Celestial Master, in the *Taizhen Code*, stated: On the seventh day of the first month of the first year, the four Lower Abbeys were bestowed, transmitted to the Heir Master, and from the Heir Master to the Lineage Master, to complete the twenty-eight lodges. Upon receiving an abbey, eighteen worthy individuals were to be feasted.\n\nThe *Taizhen Code* states: Those outside are called Separate Abbeys; those within are called Supplementary Abbeys, totaling twenty-four and completing twenty-eight. The Separate Abbeys correspond to the three eights.\n\n**1. Liyuan Abbey**, Master of Metal, paired with Changli Abbey.\n**2. Lilǐ Abbey**, Master of Wood, paired with Lishang Abbey.\n**3. Pinggong Abbey**, Master of Water, paired with Yongquan Abbey.\n**4. Gongmu Abbey**, Master of Earth, paired with Chougeng Abbey. (Note: Gongmu shares its name with the fourth of the Lower Eight Abbeys.)\n\n**5. Tiantai Abbey**, Master of Wood, paired with Benzhu Abbey.\n**6. Laixiang Abbey**, Master of Water, paired with Mengqin Abbey.\n**7. Zunling Abbey**, Master of Water, paired with Pinggai Abbey.\n**8. Daiyuan Abbey**, Master of Metal, paired with Yuntai Abbey.\n\nOn the fifth day of the tenth month of the first year of Jian’an, at sunrise, the Celestial Master bestowed the eight paired abbeys, transmitting them to the Heir Master, who then passed them to the Lineage Master. Upon receiving an abbey, fourteen worthy individuals were to be feasted. One version states fourteen, another twelve, and another omits the feasting of worthies. If following the previous convention of descending by fourteen, twelve would be appropriate; the discrepancy is likely an error.\n\nAmong the four versions, all include Stone Chambers, but none include Zunling or Stone Hall. The *Taizhen Code* also omits Stone Hall but includes Zunling; thus, Zunling is now confirmed as correct.\n\nThese are all paired with the Middle Eight, yet Jushan is uniquely absent, and Yuntai is irregularly paired among them. This creates a deficiency of one, deepening the confusion. Moreover, their locations within commanderies and counties remain uncertain, and their exact placements are unclear.\n\n**1. Emei Abbey**, Master of Metal, in Shu Commandery.\n**2. Qingcheng Abbey**, Master of Water, in Shu Commandery.\n**3. Taihua Abbey**, Master of Wood, in Jingzhao Chang’an. (Note: One version mistakenly writes \"Wood Leaf\"; the *Taizhen Code* also places Taihua here.)\n**4. Huangjin Abbey**, Master of Wood, in Quyang County of Shu Commandery.\n**5. Cimu Abbey**, Master of Metal, in Chengdu Commandery.\n**6. Afeng Abbey**, Master of Fire.\n**7. Pingdu Abbey**, Master of Water, in Jianwei Commandery.\n**8. Jiyang Abbey**, Master of Earth, in Ye County of Wei Commandery.\n\nThe above eight abbeys were established by the Lineage Master and disseminated on the fifth day of the tenth month of the third year of Jian’an. Upon receiving an abbey, twelve worthy individuals were to be feasted. These are called the Itinerant Abbeys, and their sequence is now confirmed in alignment with the *Taizhen Code*. Some texts, however, list Jiyang as the seventh and Pingdu as the eighth, which is incorrect.\n\nLeft: **Lingjue 1**, Emei’s Right: **Lingjue**.\nLeft: **Xuanwei 2**, Qingcheng’s Right: **Xuanwei**.\nLeft: **Gongping 3**, Taihua’s Right: **Gongping**.\nLeft: **Lianping 4**, Huangjin’s Right: **Lianping**.\nLeft: **Xingjiao 5**, Cimu’s Right: **Xingjiao**.\nLeft: **Weiyi 6**, Afeng’s Right: **Weiyi**.\nLeft: **Chengqi 7**, Pingdu’s Right: **Chengqi**.\nLeft: **Jianyi 8**, Jiyang’s Right: **Jianyi**.\n\nThe above sixteen Official Libationers were established by the Lineage Master. Only two versions preserve the sequence as above; three others are disordered and difficult to clarify.\n\nSince these officials were established by the Lineage Master, they should correspond to the abbeys disseminated by the Lineage Master, such as Emei and others. Now, each abbey is annotated below. If pairing abbeys, the preceding *Du Jian* and subsequent qi should be used; if separating, *Jian Gong* and subsequent qi should be applied. Each should be paired according to its proper sequence.\n\nIn total, there are four ranks and forty-four abbeys. According to the abbey rituals, from the earliest to the most revered, the order is: first the Itinerant Abbeys, second the Separate Abbeys, third the Paired Abbeys, and fourth the Three Eights’ Principal Abbeys—these are the four ranks of abbeys.\n\nThe *Taizhen Code* lists them as: first the Separate Abbeys, second the Itinerant Abbeys, third the Paired Abbeys, and fourth the Unified Abbeys. Reasoning from the code, this would imply the Itinerant Abbeys outrank the Separate Abbeys, which is incorrect. How do we know this? The Itinerant Abbeys were established by the Lineage Master, while the Separate Abbeys were bestowed by Heaven, embodying the principle of supplementing the lodges for the spring and autumn seasons. A child does not precede the father; how could a grandson’s establishment surpass the grandfather’s? This is decisively incorrect. Following the principles of Rong’s exegesis, the Itinerant Abbeys are subordinate to the Separate Abbeys; this is the true and correct understanding.\n\nThe **Gongping** office governs the qi and numbers of Heaven and Earth, ranks alongside the Master, oversees all abbeys, and manages the affairs of spirits.\n\n**Original Destiny Talismans**\n*Primary Abbey of the Azure Emperor’s True Talisman, Dongyue Master [Name], age [number], born in the [month] of [year].*\n\n**Original True Talismans of the Five Emperors**\n- Original True Talisman of the Azure Emperor: azure script on red ground.\n- Original True Talisman of the Vermilion Emperor: vermilion script on yellow ground.\n- Original True Talisman of the Yellow Emperor: yellow script on white ground.\n- Original True Talisman of the White Emperor: white script on black ground.\n- Original True Talisman of the Black Emperor: black script on azure ground.\n\n**Heaven-Soaring, Earth-Anchoring Talismans**\n- **Three Sovereigns’ Tablet Talisman**: yellow ground, tablet wrapped in purple silk, seven feet in length.\n- **Shangqing Tablet Talisman**: yellow ground, tablet wrapped in azure silk, seven feet in length.\n- **Five Talismans’ Tablet Talisman**: white ground, tablet wrapped in crimson silk, seven feet in length.\n- **True Script Tablet Talisman**: yellow ground, tablet wrapped in crimson silk, twelve feet in length.\n- **True Script Depository Tablet Talisman**: yellow ground.\n\n**Inner Talismans of the Staff**\n- Vermilion ground, azure script.\n- Yellow ground, vermilion script.\n- White ground, yellow script.\n- Black ground, white script.\n- Azure ground, black script.\n\nThe ritual sequence and protocols for receiving registers conclude here.",

The qi had only two original versions, with *Wan Tong* as above, while the remaining three versions followed the Senior Qi onward, each disordered and impossible to collate. Now, *Wan Tong* is deemed correct, and thus marked in red to clarify the sequence, each paired with its respective abbey in order.\n\nAt the conclusion of this, the Yin names pertain to women, and the Yang titles to men. Men occupy the left Balanced Qi, women the right Balanced Qi. The accumulation of old conflicts in transmission has led to this origin—how could it be otherwise? As the *Official Rites* states: the twenty-four qi of men and women make clear that men and women share these twelve, doubled left and right to form twenty-four. The evidence is sound; there should be no doubt.\n\nSome say: Yangping is assigned to the left, Lutang to the right—how could a man receive Lutang without a Yin name, or a woman bear Yangping, usurping a male title? Such reasoning is decisively incorrect; other texts follow this pattern.\n\n1. **Ganghu Abbey**",

If following the previous convention of descending by fourteen, twelve would be appropriate; the discrepancy is likely an error.\n\nAmong the four versions, all include Stone Chambers, but none include Zunling or Stone Hall. The *Taizhen Code* also omits Stone Hall but includes Zunling; thus, Zunling is now confirmed as correct.\n\nThese are all paired with the Middle Eight, yet Jushan is uniquely absent, and Yuntai is irregularly paired among them.

(Note: One version mistakenly writes \"Wood Leaf\"; the *Taizhen Code* also places Taihua here.)\n**4. Huangjin Abbey**, Master of Wood, in Quyang County of Shu Commandery.\n**5. Cimu Abbey**, Master of Metal, in Chengdu Commandery.\n**6. Afeng Abbey**, Master of Fire.\n**7. Pingdu Abbey**, Master of Water, in Jianwei Commandery.\n**8. Jiyang Abbey**, Master of Earth, in Ye County of Wei Commandery.\n\nThe above eight abbeys were established by the Lineage Master and disseminated on the fifth day of the tenth month of the third year of Jian’an. Upon receiving an abbey, twelve worthy individuals were to be feasted. These are called the Itinerant Abbeys, and their sequence is now confirmed in alignment with the *Taizhen Code*. Some texts, however, list Jiyang as the seventh and Pingdu as the eighth, which is incorrect.\n\nLeft: **Lingjue 1**, Emei’s Right: **Lingjue**.\nLeft: **Xuanwei 2**, Qingcheng’s Right: **Xuanwei**.\nLeft: **Gongping 3**, Taihua’s Right: **Gongping**.\nLeft: **Lianping 4**, Huangjin’s Right: **Lianping**.\nLeft: **Xingjiao 5**, Cimu’s Right: **Xingjiao**.\nLeft: **Weiyi 6**, Afeng’s Right: **Weiyi**.\nLeft: **Chengqi 7**, Pingdu’s Right: **Chengqi**.\nLeft: **Jianyi 8**, Jiyang’s Right: **Jianyi**.\n\nThe above sixteen Official Libationers were established by the Lineage Master. Only two versions preserve the sequence as above; three others are disordered and difficult to clarify.\n\nSince these officials were established by the Lineage Master, they should correspond to the abbeys disseminated by the Lineage Master, such as Emei and others. Now, each abbey is annotated below. If pairing abbeys, the preceding *Du Jian* and subsequent qi should be used; if separating, *Jian Gong* and subsequent qi should be applied. Each should be paired according to its proper sequence.\n\nIn total, there are four ranks and forty-four abbeys. According to the abbey rituals, from the earliest to the most revered, the order is: first the Itinerant Abbeys, second the Separate Abbeys, third the Paired Abbeys, and fourth the Three Eights’ Principal Abbeys—these are the four ranks of abbeys.\n\nThe *Taizhen Code* lists them as: first the Separate Abbeys, second the Itinerant Abbeys, third the Paired Abbeys, and fourth the Unified Abbeys. Reasoning from the code, this would imply the Itinerant Abbeys outrank the Separate Abbeys, which is incorrect. How do we know this? The Itinerant Abbeys were established by the Lineage Master, while the Separate Abbeys were bestowed by Heaven, embodying the principle of supplementing the lodges for the spring and autumn seasons. A child does not precede the father; how could a grandson’s establishment surpass the grandfather’s? This is decisively incorrect. Following the principles of Rong’s exegesis, the Itinerant Abbeys are subordinate to the Separate Abbeys; this is the true and correct understanding.\n\nThe **Gongping** office governs the qi and numbers of Heaven and Earth, ranks alongside the Master, oversees all abbeys, and manages the affairs of spirits.\n\n**Original Destiny Talismans**\n*Primary Abbey of the Azure Emperor’s True Talisman, Dongyue Master [Name], age [number], born in the [month] of [year].*\n\n**Original True Talismans of the Five Emperors**\n- Original True Talisman of the Azure Emperor: azure script on red ground.\n- Original True Talisman of the Vermilion Emperor: vermilion script on yellow ground.\n- Original True Talisman of the Yellow Emperor: yellow script on white ground.\n- Original True Talisman of the White Emperor: white script on black ground.\n- Original True Talisman of the Black Emperor: black script on azure ground.\n\n**Heaven-Soaring, Earth-Anchoring Talismans**\n- **Three Sovereigns’ Tablet Talisman**: yellow ground, tablet wrapped in purple silk, seven feet in length.\n- **Shangqing Tablet Talisman**: yellow ground, tablet wrapped in azure silk, seven feet in length.\n- **Five Talismans’ Tablet Talisman**: white ground, tablet wrapped in crimson silk, seven feet in length.\n- **True Script Tablet Talisman**: yellow ground, tablet wrapped in crimson silk, twelve feet in length.\n- **True Script Depository Tablet Talisman**: yellow ground.\n\n**Inner Talismans of the Staff**\n- Vermilion ground, azure script.\n- Yellow ground, vermilion script.\n- White ground, yellow script.\n- Black ground, white script.\n- Azure ground, black script.\n\nThe ritual sequence and protocols for receiving registers conclude here.",
      "overlap_context": "gin—how could it be otherwise? As the *Official Rites* states: the twenty-four qi of men and women make clear that men and women share these twelve, doubled left and right to form twenty-four. The evidence is sound; there should be no doubt.\n\nSome say: Yangping is assigned to the left, Lutang to the right—how could a man receive Lutang without a Yin name, or a woman bear Yangping, usurping a male title? Such reasoning is decisively incorrect; other texts follow this pattern.\n\n1. **Ganghu Abbey**",
