  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Great Mystery Nine Yang Illuminations**\n*Composed by Master Great Mystery of the Grotto, Divine Abode of Mount Gushe*\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Great Mystery Nine Yang Illuminations*\n*Compiled by Jin Hou Shanyuan*\n*One scroll.*\n\n**Source of Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era, Section of Grotto Realms, Category of Numinous Diagrams*\n\n**Preface**\nThe Dao is fundamentally wordless; words are provisionally established to clarify the Way.\nThe divine is inherently imageless; images are provisionally employed to seek truth.\nWithin, it harmonizes yin’s corporeal soul; without, it refines yang’s ethereal spirit,\nAccordant with the principle of being and non-being, responsive to the mechanism of movement and stillness.\nOne ascent, one descent—transforming the wondrous origin of the Three Palaces;\nOne floating, one sinking—guiding the soaring mystery of the Six Caverns’ flying qi.\nNon-action as action perfects the nature of the One True;\nNon-doing as doing tempers the elixir of the Nine Yang.\nWhen the elixir attains the pearl’s coagulation, essence flows as celestial water;\nMeeting the sun, it ascends in rosy clouds, transcending the myriad forms at their very inception.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nBefore awakening, one must rely on the myriad methods;\nOnce the heart opens, not a single thing remains.\nWithin, the Mystery Pearl manifests—\nSilent, companionless, vast as the Void.\n\n**The Great Mystery’s Chaos Diagram**\nNow, chaos is the void’s expanse, the dark abyss without light;\nMysterious essence unmanifest, heaven and earth undivided.\nThe body is pure, profound, and nonexistent—\nNot knowing the *how* yet thus it is.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nProfoundly still, without sound or hue,\nSilent, boundless, obscure, and dark.\nBefore the forms of heaven and earth emerged,\nThe essence of the Great One lay deeply concealed.\n\n**Chart of Principles:**\n*Qingleng* (Pure Cold)          *Wuwei* (Non-Action)\n*Daode* (Virtue/Power)         *Ziran* (Spontaneity)\n\n**The Unseen Diagram**\nNow, the unseen arises from the cultivator of truth who has not opened the eye of the Dao. Though facing the brightness of sun and moon, one cannot know one’s own nature. Day and night pass in movement, yet the myriad existences remain obscure. Thus, the clarity of things depends on the essence of the *mao*-blurred.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nUnseen, the eye bears flaws and disease;\nOnce the heart opens, the Dao’s vision is cleansed.\nAwakened, the Dipper appears at noon;\nDeluded, the Mystery Pearl is lost in waves.\n\n**The Great Mystery’s Spirit-Restraining Diagram**\nWithin, no form is visible—luminous, void, and still. The image resembles dark frost, for it is the root of life’s fixed stem.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nGentle, weak, and utterly empty—supreme virtue,\nHumble, hidden, and selfless.\nClosing the eyes, refining thought, forsaking reflection,\nSilent, inwardly guarding true compassion.\n\n**The Great Mystery’s Spirit-Refining Diagram**\nThe Dao is not seen by ordinary sight but by true vision.\nWondrously, the spirit transforms, radiant in all directions,\nBrilliant as the mingled yang-soul,\nRoaming before the Emperor of Images.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nEyes bright beneath brows, light resplendent,\nPiercing the hollow wall of Mount Jing.\nDazzling, the numinous treasure grows pure,\nPervading the subtle vastness of the Great Void.\n\n**The Great Mystery’s Movement and Stillness Diagram**\nThe Dao is without intent, profoundly still and unmoving.\nSilent and mysterious—this is stillness.\nThe spirit responds when stirred, connecting through resonance,\nDispersing in wondrous subtlety—this is movement.\nOne movement, one stillness—thus the true Dao is accomplished.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nShattering Mount Jing to seek jade,\nRending the world’s net to search for the Mystery.\nTwo points of pure light, luminous and clear,\nA single wheel of the red sun fills the sky.\n\n**The Great Mystery’s Being and Non-Being Diagram**\nThe Great Dao acts without acting yet lacks no action.\nActing, it has being; in essence, it is non-being.\nNon-being in function yet possessing being.\nPenetrating the mysterious to enter the wondrous,\nRevealing the Dao’s numinous power—\nThis is the principle of being and non-being giving rise to one another.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nJade cassia hidden in the moonlit sea,\nJewel forests gleaming with cold light.\nMysterious illumination, perfectly one,\nEmbracing the boundless, vast and without limit.\n\n**The Great Mystery’s Ascending and Descending Diagram**\nGazing upward, it grows ever higher—\nThe spirit ascends, revealing the floating signs of celestial images.\nDelving deeper, it grows ever firmer—\nThe spirit descends, responding to earth’s sinking principles.\nBalanced in emptiness and applied,\nRising and falling in harmony,\nCommuning with the myriad mechanisms,\nEffortlessly shifting between above and below.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe spirit transforms, ascending and descending,\nThe Dao’s mechanism floats and sinks.\nWithin the mystery, the numinous treasure grows wondrous,\nIts light illuminating the heart of heaven.\n\n**The Great Mystery’s Three Essentials Diagram**\nThe origin of the Great Beginning—\nThe Dao of emptiness and non-being.\nThe pervading radiance—\nThe brightness of the Emperor of Images.\nThe congealing of fetal light—\nThe illumination of the primordial spirit.\nThe three as one, perfectly blended,\nManifesting the principle of true emptiness.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe Golden Elixir is like the red sun,\nThe supreme Dao resembles the blue sky.\nAs long as the eye’s light remains undimmed,\nWhy seek the Mystery outside?\n\n**The Great Mystery’s Six Harmonies Diagram**\nThe Dao of heaven and the Dao of humanity commune—\nEmptiness containing emptiness.\nThe harmonious and the primordial merge—\nQi containing qi.\nWisdom’s light and the Emperor of Images congeal—\nSpirit containing spirit.\nThe six caverns fly in mystery—\nThis is the Dao of the threefold union.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nSunlight piercing the dark yang, penetrating all,\nWind splitting the summit, heaven opening.\nThe land fills with dragon-light, advancing in splendor,\nThe spirit’s work soars on two wings.\n\n**The Great Mystery’s Nine Yangs Diagram**\nAs in the principles above, all mingle as one.\nThe transformation of the One True—\nShaping the formless form.\nBrilliant, flowing light,\nIlluminating the eight directions,\nInner and outer luminous and clear—\nThis is the truth of the nine yangs’ mysterious image.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nIlluminating the true, observing earth and heaven,\nStars flying, awakening to the profound mystery.\nEven here, subtle obstructions remain—\nHow could it compare to the state before all beginning?\n\n---\n\n**According to the *Golden and Azure Ancient Scripture* on the Cultivation Diagrams of Truth:**\nOn the third day of the lunar month, the moon emerges at the *geng* position, corresponding to the *Zhen* trigram, rising with one

dawn and dusk.\n\n**The *Gen* Diagram**\nOn the twenty-third day, the last quarter moon resides at *bing*, corresponding to the *Gen* trigram, with two yin lines returning.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe *Xun* trigram transforms into *Gen*,\nOn the twenty-third day, the last quarter.\nThe *Jing* says: Over thirty days,\n*Kun* gives rise to *Zhen*, *Dui*, *Qian*,\n*Qian* gives rise to *Xun*, *Gen*, *Kun*.\nThe spirit’s work shifts and moves,\nEndless as a ring.\nThe eight trigrams arrayed,\nNever failing in their timely use.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe Central Origin exchanges *Kan* and *Li*,\nSuddenly, perception and knowledge appear.\nWater and fire conceal the sacred,\nYin and yang pair in wondrous union.\nThe heart congeals, merging with plain substance,\nThe form dissolves, transcending the subtle.\nBlending with the *Qian*-primordial image,\nStarlight gleams in the Milky Way.\n\n**The *Zhen* Diagram**\nOn the third day, the moon emerges at the *geng* position, corresponding to the *Zhen* trigram, rising with one yang line.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe first nine transforms into *Zhen*,\nOn the third day, the moon gradually appears at *geng*.\nThe clear eye opens to reflection—\nThe

*Kun*,\n*Kun*’s primal qi veils the image.\nPure yin arises from *yi*’s earth,\nThe utmost Dao awakens without end.\n\n**The *Li* Diagram**\n*Li* holds emptiness within: in heaven it is the sun, in

earth stretch boundless and level.\n\n**The *Kan* Diagram**\n*Kan* holds fullness within: in heaven it is the moon, in man the ear—hearing and knowing is sageliness.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*Kan* conceals the

civilized splendor.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nOne nature, pure and steadfast,\nMyriad transformations embrace the numinous.\nTrue primal essence, refined and perfect,\nTruly crystallized as luminous stars.\n\n**The Nine Yangs of Supreme Mystery: Cultivating True Perfection**\n\n**Song:**\nAt the dawn of primordial chaos,\nPrimal harmony transformed the Great Beginning.\nThree palaces divide above and below,\nSix caverns respond to sinking and floating.\nBrahmanic qi circulates boundlessly,\nPrimordial radiance pervades being and nonbeing.\nHeaven and earth serve as the precious crucible,\nThe cosmos becomes the elixir furnace.\nThe Emperor of Images holds the numinous essence,\nRound and bright, harmonizing the Great Void.\nSpirit congeals as the phoenix’s marrow,\nQi crystallizes as the azure toad’s essence.\nRefined into true purity,\nPure yin is wholly eradicated.\nThe nine yangs gather as sacred fire,\nTransforming into the Pearl of Chaos Primordial.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTransmitted as a model,\nWithin it discerns being and nonbeing.\nBeing and nonbeing shine through to the depths,\nThe mysterious image transmutes into the elixir pearl.\n\n**The Twelve Hours of Supreme Mystery**\n\n**Midnight (*Zi*)**\nAt midnight, the Mysterious Origin’s Sage Ancestor imparts his teaching.\nYang’s essence shines with the wind of remote antiquity,\nThe Celestial Vault delights in the Unfettered Master.\nEach claims ability—why exhaust yourself?\nForget the one mechanism, and all lies herein.\nZigao’s feathers descend as divine birds,\nYet why seek the monstrous roc when none appears?\n\n**Second (*Chou*)**\nAt cock’s crow, in dreams one awakens the luminous primal head.\nYang’s light has yet to emerge, yet the eyes open early,\nHeavenly water returns the numinous to the Dipper’s mouth.\nUnlock the Mysterious Pass,\nConnect the mechanism at the elbow,\nSilently release nonbeing—clarity arises from within.\nOnly then does one grasp the art of escape,\nThe great sound’s simplicity—how could it roar?\n\n**Third (*Yin*)**\nAt dawn’s first light, numinous yang has yet to appear, yet things renew.\nThe perfect bamboo’s brightness is hard to voice,\nThe ignorant chatter ceaselessly.\nForget the turbid form,\nExchange the defiled body,\nThe Dao’s companion dwells among immortals, choosing the loftiest neighbor.\nThose who cannot distinguish truth from falsehood are madmen,\nStolidly contending in the dust as \"I\" and \"others.\"\n\n**Fourth (*Mao*)**\nAt sunrise, the cinnabar phoenix soars without entanglement.\nResplendent, its radiance embraces the vast sky,\nBrilliant, it illuminates the minutest twigs.\nThe immortal’s mechanism,\nSuddenly comprehended,\nThe mysterious and true, subtle and pure—yet not trifling.\nThe cracks in the vessel release the Central Flower’s principle,\nHeaven’s luster, dustless, transmits the Six Treasures.\n\n**Fifth (*Chen*)**\nAt breakfast hour, the dense celestial light illumines the Valley Spirit.\nAbundant and vast, it fuses into oneness,\nEntering the year through the subtle breath, discussing the Three Bodies.\nThe Dao is empty and still,\nNature attains itself.\nChaos primordial congeals, things grow rich and pure.\nDo not equate the demonic *taowu* with the jade grove,\nBetween the maples, the numinous *chun* emerges anew from the old.\n\n**Sixth (*Si*)**\nAt mid-morning, the Dao naturally abides: from the Three-in-One, the Two arise.\nThe *zi* bell’s bamboo is dim-witted, lacking deep thought,\nYet it extends and contracts, grasping the Sage’s intent.\nAwaken to true emptiness,\nIlluminate the teaching’s essence,\nOne numinous awareness pervades heaven and earth.\nDwelling in vast solitude within the Great Void,\nWho can reveal this return to the origin?\n\n**Seventh (*Wu*)**\nAt noon, the celestial light blazes, dazzling the earth.\nThe *shu* child dwells deep within the *shu* chamber,\nFace serene and pale, forgetting bitterness and sweetness.\nAwakening and delusion,\nEach finds its place,\nAssisting the upright, expelling the perverse—measurement is needed.\nThe Enlightened Emperor of Images emerges from prior heaven,\nWielding the pure wind of remote antiquity.\n\n**Eighth (*Wei*)**\nAt afternoon decline, the courtyard is silent, the golden mastiff ceases its bark.\nSilently guard the divine work’s supreme mechanism,\nThe numinous waves surge to the depths, filling heaven and earth.\nAbide in the subtle and mysterious,\nTruly pure and lovely,\nThose who have not awakened must proceed with care.\nUnveiling the jade gate, the starry eyes appear,\nYet who can fathom the Dao’s single character as \"good\"?\n\n**Ninth (*Shen*)**\nAt evening meal hour, delight in heaven and know fate, free from hardship.\nNo envy for Qi’s three offices of beauty,\nNo desire for Lin Lei’s hundred springs.\nThe Dao as master,\nNature as guest,\nThe two qi congeal, uniting in utmost truth.\nGazing upward, one borrows the toad’s palace shadow,\nAlready encountering floating wood emerging from the wave’s ford.\n\n**Tenth (*You*)**\nAt sunset, solitary and expansive, still and friendless.\nLofty peaks, the moon rises, scattering jade flowers,\nBy the stream, the wind gently sways golden willows.\nThe Dao arises of itself,\nSpirit and thought guard,\nRound and bright, profound and limpid—within nonbeing, being.\nEssential yang bursts forth in the Great Void,\nDriving back yin demons beyond the heavens.\n\n**Eleventh (*Xu*)**\nAt dusk, twin painted candles illuminate the empty chamber.\nChildren play within its radiance,\nThe red child’s work is complete in this brilliance.\nWield nature’s light,\nSpirit’s majestic power,\nForm dissolves, the heart congeals—extending and withdrawing.\nTruly, the single flavor of supreme yang’s essence,\nThe wise master’s nourishment—sweet as honey.\n\n**Twelfth (*Hai*)**\nAt human rest, the screen is lowered, the door closed, forgetting love and hate.\nSelf-content, serene, beyond the world’s mechanism,\nCarefree and unconstrained, nothing hinders stillness.\nThe Dao flourishes in talismans,\nTrue origin abides,\nHeaven and earth’s fullness and emptiness reveal fortune and misfortune.\n*Zhun* and *Meng* receive the hexagrams, bestowing life and completion,\nMyriad sages and thousand perfected all rely upon this.\n\n**The Supreme Mystery’s Nine Yangs Diagram of the Upper Clarity is complete.**",

ford.\n\n**Tenth (*You*)**\nAt sunset, solitary and expansive, still and friendless.\nLofty peaks, the moon rises, scattering jade flowers,\nBy the stream, the wind gently sways golden willows.\nThe

heavens.\n\n**Eleventh (*Xu*)**\nAt dusk, twin painted candles illuminate the empty chamber.\nChildren play within its radiance,\nThe red child’s work is complete in this brilliance.\nWield nature’s light,\nSpirit’s majestic power,\nForm dissolves, the heart congeals—extending and withdrawing.\nTruly, the single flavor of supreme yang’s essence,\nThe wise master’s nourishment—sweet as honey.\n\n**Twelfth (*Hai*)**\nAt human rest, the screen is lowered, the door closed, forgetting love and hate.\nSelf-content, serene, beyond the world’s mechanism,\nCarefree and unconstrained, nothing hinders stillness.\nThe Dao flourishes in talismans,\nTrue origin abides,\nHeaven and earth’s fullness and emptiness reveal fortune and misfortune.\n*Zhun* and *Meng* receive the hexagrams,
