Nurture with gentle fire until red, then refine with great fire for one night. It yields white sulfur, resisting fire to form a molten essence.\n\n**Bright Moon Herb**\nThe **Water Red Herb** bears red blossoms, is pure in nature, with crimson stems.\nHeaven names it *Water Red*; its intent to subdue mercury is not weighty.\nYet it uniquely subdues white sal ammoniac and serves the great crucibles of yin and yang.\nThis herb may also be ingested, greatly treating diseases of water qi.\n\n**Red Flame Herb**\nThis herb grows within water, bearing red blossoms, green leaves, and a pungent taste.\nIt is said that herbs congealing cinnabar, as well as all stones forming cinnabar, when placed within the **Red Flame Herb**, are fully subdued without loss.\n\n**Earth Banana Herb**\nRed blossoms, black seeds, green stems and leaves.\nIts power to subdue medicines is unmatched in clarity and excellence—none surpass the **Earth Banana**.\nNot only does it draw forth true mercury, but it also subdues saltpeter within stones.\nThe **Earth Banana** subdues saltpeter and extracts mercury.\n\n**Treasure Mountain Herb**\nRed blossoms, green leaves.\nThis numinous herb is called *Treasure Mountain*, dwelling within great forests.\nImmortal families guard it in secret; its worth is ten thousand coins.\nIts juice boils mercury into hardened cinnabar, also subduing and revealing treasure cinnabar.\n\n**Lesser White Fortune Herb**\nRed blossoms, stems, calyxes, and leaves all green.\nThis herb bears red blossoms and green leaves, growing upon high ridges.

It subdues and governs mercury and lead, worthy of the *Yongquan* crucible.\n\n**Sea Pomegranate Herb**\nRed blossoms, green leaves.\nSeeking mercury knows no rest—none surpass the **Sea Pomegranate**.\nWithout encountering this numinous herb’s root, one’s life nears its end!\nIts taste is bitter, yet the seeds it bears are sweet. When alive, mercury clings to its juice and withers—thus it is also called the *Withered Mercury Herb*.\n\n**Red Indigo Herb**\nThe **Assembled Treasure Herb** has green stems and leaves.\nHeaven bestows the name *Assembled Treasure*; its leaves remain verdant through all four seasons.\nMost people do not recognize it, though it resembles gold within the palm.\nIngesting it lengthens life; consuming it raw effectively treats the heart.\nWere this not the true immortal’s root, few in the world would know its melody.\nThis herb grows upon sandy ridges. Its taste is sweet and can refine all medicines without loss.\n\n**Sea Peach Herb**\nNuminous branches are called **Sea Peach**; ingesting it effectively treats consumptive illness.\nNot only does it lengthen life, but it also softens mercury and tin.\nThis herb grows within great forests, greatly treating consumptive diseases. It bears yellow blossoms and green leaves, with a bitter taste, and can soften the five metals.\n\n**Golden Lamp Herb**\nThis herb’s taste is pungent; immortal families call it **Golden Lamp**.\nIngesting it cures illness; after one year, the body becomes light.\nIt whitens *pīpī* and congeals mercury, renewing it.\nOtherwise, it saves lives and extracts lead from within mercury.\nThis herb’s taste is pungent, growing upon high slopes.

It bears red blossoms, green leaves, and a sweet taste.
