  "full_translation": "The *Annotations on the Inner Chapters of Zhuangzi*\n*By Kuanglu Yisou of the Ming Dynasty; Commentary by Hanshan Shi Deqing*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* is a commentary and exegesis on the *Laozi*. I have often said that Zhuangzi’s relation to Laozi is like Mencius’s to Confucius. If one fully awakens to the Dao of Laozi and then reads this book, one sees that it emerges entirely from transformations within that Dao. Yet because its author possessed vast talent and expansive eloquence, his words surge and flow with unrestrained freedom—so much so that readers grasp at them like chasing the wind or clutching at shadows. Only by thoroughly perceiving the intent behind his words can one avoid being deceived by them.\n\nThe entire work consists of thirty-three chapters, but the seven inner chapters alone exhaust its meaning; the outer chapters are merely elaborations and embellishments. If scholars penetrate the inner chapters with precision, they will attain boundless joy and cease to be ordinary worldly people.\n\nThe origins and influences of its learning, as well as the elucidation of its theories, have already been thoroughly expounded. I urge you to study them carefully.\n\n**Volume One: \"Free and Easy Wandering\"**\nThis is the first chapter of the book. Zhuangzi himself said: \"Words have their source; affairs have their ruler.\" This is precisely the foundational principle of his discourse.\n\n\"Free and easy\" (*xiaoyaoyou*) conveys the meaning of vastness and unconstrained freedom, akin to the \"unobstructed liberation\" (*apratihatā-vimokṣa*) in Buddhist scriptures. The Buddha attains liberation by severing all afflictions, while Zhuangzi achieves it by transcending the physical form, dissolving cunning and knowledge, and not being burdened by the pursuit of fame and achievement for the sake of one’s own life. He points to the void and the natural as the homeland of the Great Dao, the realm of *xiaoyaoyou*—as seen in later phrases like \"the land of nothing whatsoever\" (*wuheyou zhi xiang*) and \"the vast and boundless wilds\" (*guangmo zhi ye*). This implies that only the true person (*zhenren*) can wander in this vast and unconstrained expanse—namely, the \"Great Master\" (*dazongshi*) referred to below.\n\nOrdinary people fail to attain such freedom because they are shackled by the notion of the self (*wo*). Thus, all their actions are directed toward their own lives, seeking merit and fame. From ancient times to the present, the entire world has been tormented by these three concerns throughout their lives—when have they ever experienced a moment of true joy? Only the great sages, having forgotten these three things, attain boundless freedom and unconstrained delight.\n\nHow pitiful are worldly people, so deluded and confined, acting only for the sake of their own selves! Their vision is narrow, and not only do they fail to comprehend the wonder of the Great Dao, but even when it is spoken of, they do not believe it—just as the text says, \"lesser knowledge does not reach greater knowledge\" (*xiao zhi bu ji da zhi*), which expresses this idea.\n\nThe central intent of this chapter is to establish the framework of \"the perfected person (*zhiren*) has no self, the sage (*shengren*) has no merit, the spirit-like person (*shenren*) has no fame.\" This guiding principle is only fully revealed at the end, demonstrating the transformative and exhilarating nature of his prose. If scholars grasp the foundational intent of his words, the essence of the entire book will become clear.\n\nIn the Northern Darkness (for the Northern Sea is the abyss of the Dark and Mysterious), there is a fish—its name is Kun. The Kun is so vast that none know how many thousand *li* it spans. It transforms into a bird—its name is Peng. The Peng’s back is so broad that none know how many thousand *li* it measures; when it rouses itself to flight, its wings hang like clouds draped across the sky. This bird, when the sea surges, will journey to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond.\n\nZhuangzi declares that in his words, \"ninety percent are parables, seventy percent are reiterations, and his impromptu speech flows daily, harmonizing with the natural grain of things.\" The entire book’s discourse does not stray from these three forms. The Kun and Peng, for instance, are parables—employing things to convey meaning, to illuminate the Dao, as in what is called analogy. The intent of this passage on \"free and easy wandering\" (*xiaoyaoyou*) is simply to depict the sage who has attained vastness and transformation. Only the sage achieves true freedom. Thus, he fashions the Kun and Peng to illustrate the meaning of \"vastness and transformation.\"\n\nThe Northern Darkness is the Northern Sea, a remote and unseen place, symbolizing the profound and obscure Great Dao. The Kun within the sea represents the embryo of the great sage nurtured within the body of the Dao. Just as the vast Kun could only be reared in the boundless Northern Sea, so too the sage’s potential is cultivated within the vastness of the Dao. The Kun’s transformation into the Peng directly symbolizes the sage who has attained \"vastness and transformation.\" Yet though the Kun is immense, it remains but a single inert thing—who would recognize its greatness? Only when it transforms into the Peng does its vastness become apparent. The Peng’s wings, like clouds hanging from the sky, make its magnitude even more evident than the Kun’s immensity in the sea.\n\n\"Rousing itself to flight\" describes how the Peng’s vastness makes flight no easy feat; it must muster its entire strength to take wing. This mirrors the sage, who, though possessing the fullness of the Dao, lies submerged in the profound stillness of the abyss, its power dormant. Only by exerting the full force of the Dao can it emerge from stillness into activity—just as the Peng must rouse itself to fly. Once the sage appears, its wings shelter all living things, hence the analogy of the bird’s wings like clouds draped across the sky—a magnitude beyond comparison with the Kun.\n\n\"When the sea surges\" refers to the movement of the sea’s *qi*, symbolizing how the sage emerges into the world borne by the great tide of *qi*—no ordinary occurrence. \"Will journey\" means to migrate. The Southern Darkness, akin to the Southern Light, signifies the direction of yang brightness, a metaphor for the sovereign who faces south. It suggests that when the sage responds to the turning of the times and appears in the world, they become a sagely emperor or enlightened king, facing south to govern all under heaven. The later chapter \"The Great and Venerable Teacher\" speaks of this same sage as \"responding to the emperor and king,\" embodying the intent of migrating to the Southern Darkness. This is what is meant by \"words having a source, affairs having a lord.\"\n\n*Qi Xie* is a record of anomalies. It states: \"When the Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, it beats the water for three thousand *li*, spirals upward on the whirlwind for ninety thousand *li*, and departs on the sixth-month gale.\" Zhuangzi’s intent is that the tale of the Kun and Peng’s transformation may seem fantastical, risking disbelief. Thus, he cites this as evidence, declaring that his account is not mere idle talk but something he found in *Qi Xie*. One might ask: What sort of book is *Qi Xie*? It is a record of strange and wondrous events. Hence, it states: \"When the Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, it beats the water for three thousand *li*.\" Its wings strike the sea, churning the waves for three thousand *li*—its vastness is thus revealed. The \"whirlwind\" is a great wind. Beating its wings against this wind, it soars upward ninety thousand *li* in a single ascent—its magnitude is further confirmed. The \"sixth month\" refers to the sixth month of the Zhou calendar, the fourth month of summer, when yang energy flourishes, and the winds grow strong and forceful, enabling the Peng to lift its wings. \"Gale\" here means wind, likening the winds of heaven and earth to the breath within the human body.\n\nThis passage is where his brushwork stirs with exhilaration, and with this evidence, his words become credible. \"The wild horses of the plains, the dust motes—all living things are blown about by the breath.\" Is the deep blue of the sky its true color? Or is it so distant that it has no end? When one looks down from above, it appears no different. This speaks to the meaning of vastness upon vastness.\n\nThe \"wild horses\" are the mirages of the marshlands, insubstantial things. The \"dust motes\" are the floating specks in the air, illuminated by sunlight streaming through crevices. \"Living things blown about by the breath\" refers to the birds and insects of the world. \"Blown about by the breath\" speaks to the subtlety of qi. The deep blue of the sky is not its true color, but rather the boundless expanse of the great void, where the eye’s power fails to reach. This suggests that the Peng bird’s magnitude may indeed be called great, yet when viewed from the vastness of the great void above, it appears no different from the wild horses or dust motes—how minute it seems! Even the mighty winds of the whirlwind that stir it are but like the breath that blows and puffs among living things—what greatness is there in that? Thus it is said: \"When one looks down from above, it appears no different.\" This implies that even the greatness of the sage, though vast, remains bound by form and still possesses shape and structure. Yet the formless, nameless great Dao transcends all such limitations—what comparison could there be? This is to say that the sage’s freedom comes from the Dao, not from form.\n\nMoreover, if water does not accumulate in great depth, it lacks the strength to bear a great boat. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the ground, and a mustard seed may serve as a boat; but place a cup there, and it will stick fast—for the water is shallow and the boat too large. If wind does not accumulate in great depth, it lacks the strength to bear great wings. Thus, only when the wind lies beneath at ninety thousand *li* can the Peng rise aloft (for the wind must be below and the wings above, lifting and bearing it, so that it may soar far). Only then does it ride the wind, its back bearing the blue sky, with nothing to obstruct or hinder its path (no midway collapse or stagnation). Only then does it dare to plan its journey south. This passage summarizes the transformation of the Kun into the Peng and its southward flight, subtly likening it to the great sage, who must cultivate deeply and amass profoundly before being put to use. It means that if the waters of the northern sea are not deep, they cannot nurture the great Kun; and even when the Kun transforms into the Peng, without the great wind to lift and bear it, it cannot reach the southern darkness. This is like saying that without the profound and vast depths of the great Dao, it cannot nurture the embryo of the great sage; even if the great form is cultivated, without transformation, it cannot achieve great use; and even with the sage’s power, without the great momentum of a flourishing world, it cannot emerge in response to the times to accomplish its vast and luminous work. Only by deep cultivation and awaiting the right moment can the full potential of the great sage be realized. Thus, the text speaks of water and wind to illustrate the need for profound accumulation. Yet the accumulation of water originally refers to the Kun. Here, instead of speaking of nurturing fish, the text shifts to bearing boats—this is a transformation in the writing, making it elusive. Had it remained fixed on the Kun, the prose would have been stiff and clumsy. The intent is to mock those of shallow learning, who lack deep virtue and yet dare to speak of great achievements.\n\nThe cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at it, saying: \"We exert ourselves in flight, striking the elm and sandalwood, and if we do not reach them, we simply descend to the ground—why go ninety thousand *li* to the south?\" Those who travel to the nearby wilderness return after three meals with their bellies still full; but those who journey a hundred *li* must pound grain the night before, and those who go a thousand *li* must gather provisions for three months. What do these two creatures know? This illustrates how petty knowledge cannot comprehend great knowledge. It means that those of limited vision in the world, unaware of the sage’s greatness, are like these two creatures whose flight is exhausted upon reaching the elm and sandalwood, and so they laugh at the Peng’s journey of ninety thousand *li*—what need is there for such a thing? This is to say that petty people, content with mere sustenance for body and mouth, see no use for the great Dao of the sage. Zhuangzi thus explains that the limited vision of worldly people, who do not understand the sage, stems from their lack of far-reaching aspirations, and so their cultivation remains shallow, each according to their capacity. Thus, those who travel to a place within sight need not store provisions, for a single meal suffices for the round trip, leaving them still satiated. This is like petty people, content with the present. Those who journey a hundred *li* have slightly greater aspirations, so they pound grain the night before; those who go a thousand *li* gather provisions for three months, for as their aspirations grow, so too does their preparation. Compared to these two creatures, born among the elm and sandalwood, utterly lacking in understanding and without any ambition for far-reaching flight, it is no wonder they laugh at the Peng’s flight. Such is the nature of the petty knowledge of the world. Petty knowledge cannot comprehend great knowledge, just as short years cannot comprehend long years (here, short and long years are used to further illustrate the difference between petty and great knowledge).\n\nHow do we know this is so? The morning mushroom (a fungus growing in dung and decay, sprouting at dawn and withering by dusk) knows nothing of the waxing and waning of the moon; the cicada (a summer insect) knows nothing of spring and autumn—these are short-lived creatures. South of Chu there is the Dark Spirit (a divine turtle), for whom five hundred years make a spring, five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity there was the Great Camphor, for whom eight thousand years make a spring, eight thousand years an autumn—these are long-lived beings. Yet Pengzu (a man famed for his longevity) is now singled out for his enduring years, and when common people compare themselves to him, is it not lamentable? This, then, is why the two insects fail to comprehend the Peng’s vastness, just as those of petty knowledge cannot grasp the boundless wisdom of the sage—each confined to their own measure, and no wonder. How could the morning mushroom or the cicada ever know of the lifespans of the Dark Spirit or the Great Camphor? Moreover, people speak only of Pengzu’s eight hundred years, as if he were unique in all of history, and yet they rarely aspire to match even his longevity. Compared to the Great Camphor, Pengzu’s years are but a fleeting moment—how much more tragic is the plight of common folk. Such is the limit of petty knowledge.\n\nTang’s inquiry of Ji (Tang’s worthy minister) illustrates this same truth: that petty knowledge cannot fathom great knowledge. Far to the north of the barren lands lies the Dark Sea, a celestial lake (for both the Northern and Southern Dark Seas are oceans, hence the term \"celestial lake\"). There dwells a fish, its breadth spanning thousands of *li*, its length unknown—its name is Kun. There is also a bird, named Peng, its back like Mount Tai, its wings like clouds trailing from the sky. It mounts the whirlwind, spiraling upward ninety thousand *li*, piercing through the clouds, bearing the blue heavens on its back, then sets its course southward, bound for the Southern Dark Sea. The quail (a small bird of the marshes) laughs at it, saying: \"Where does it think it’s going? I leap and flutter no higher than a few *ren*, soaring among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the height of flight! Where does it think it’s going?\" Such is the distinction between the small and the great.\n\nEarlier, I cited the *Qi Xie* to verify the tale of Kun and Peng; now I invoke Tang’s inquiry of Ji to confirm the matter of petty and great knowledge. What was said above about the limits of petty knowledge—that it cannot comprehend great knowledge—is precisely what Tang once asked Ji. Yet here, the example of Kun and Peng not only proves the vastness of fish and bird but also underscores the distinction between small and great. Thus, one citation serves a dual purpose: the events are the same, but the intent differs.\n\nTherefore, those who (in bearing the above in mind) deem their knowledge sufficient to serve in one office, their conduct worthy of comparison to one village, their virtue pleasing to one ruler, or their credibility trusted by one state—they regard themselves as if they were that quail. Yet Song Rongzi would still laugh at them (Song Rongzi was a worthy man of Song. His laughter was directed at those four types of people, who toil ceaselessly for talent, wisdom, and the fleeting renown of their own narrow pursuits). Moreover, though the whole world praises them, they are not spurred on; though the whole world condemns them, they are not disheartened (disheartened: cast down, their countenance fallen). They have settled the division between inner and outer, discerned the boundary between honor and disgrace—this is all. (Song Rongzi’s laughter at those who toil for fleeting fame stems from his own ability to forget renown. Thus, though the whole world praises him, he is not encouraged; though the whole world condemns him, he is not disheartened. He merely affirms that his inner virtue is his own, while external slander or praise belongs to others—thus, neither affects his resolve. He knows that honor and disgrace have no bearing on him. This is all there is to it.) In his dealings with the world, he is not restless. (The reason Song Rongzi can forget slander and praise is simply that he does not strive for the world’s empty renown.) Yet he has not yet established himself. (He has not yet firmly rooted himself, for though he can forget fame, he has not forgotten the self.)\n\nLiezi could ride the wind and travel, moving with effortless grace, returning after fifteen days. In his pursuit of fortune, he was not restless. Though he was thus spared the need to walk, he still depended on something. (Though Liezi could forget misfortune and fortune, he had not forgotten life and death. His form and bones remained bound, so he could not wander with the Creator through the infinite. He relied on the wind to ascend, and after no more than fifteen days, he returned—it was no eternal departure.)\n\nAs for one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth (constancy: the fundamental nature of Heaven and Earth, as in the constancy of each thing’s nature and destiny), who harnesses the transformations of the six qi (riding Heaven and Earth, the cosmos is within you. The six qi—yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and light—are the vital forces of creation. Harnessing the six qi, creation is born within the self, and one who thus rides the Great Dao is a true wanderer), and roams the boundless—what does such a one have to depend on? (The sage who rides the Great Dao and wanders, merging with creation as one, what external thing could he possibly depend on?)\n\nThus it is said: The Perfect One is without self, the Spirit-like One is without achievement, the Sage is without name. (The Perfect One, the Spirit-like One, and the Sage are but one—they need not be viewed as three. This describes the sage who has attained true freedom. The sage forgets form and transcends dependence, rising above life and death, dwelling beyond the myriad transformations, vast and unconstrained, delighting in the Dao, unburdened by things. Only such a one attains true freedom, which those of petty knowledge cannot comprehend.)\n\nZhuangzi’s fundamental intent in his writings is to declare that no one in ancient or modern times has ever attained true freedom—all are shackled by this flesh-and-blood form, ensnared by the self, and thus ceaselessly pursue achievement and fame, tormenting themselves through life without a single moment of ease. Clinging solely to the bodily frame, they know nothing beyond it; how could they ever glimpse the Great Dao? Only the sage who has transformed through the vastness of the Dao forgets the self, forgets achievement, forgets fame, transcends life and death, and wanders in the realm of the Great Dao—thus attaining boundless freedom and joy without end. How could those of narrow, petty understanding ever comprehend this? It is no different from the cicada and the quail mocking the roc. His central point is simply this: the sage’s realm is beyond the reach of small minds, and so he crafts the tale of the roc’s transformations to startle the eyes and ears of the world. Yet these are all allegories, meant to shock the vulgar. He begins with seemingly unrelated matters, only here revealing his true intent, concluding with a single phrase to tie it all together. Such is the artistry of literary composition—none but one of vast spirit could muster such force. Only those who have cultivated themselves can truly grasp its wonder.\n\nThe foregoing is allegory. What follows points directly to the sage who has forgotten the self, forgotten achievement, and forgotten fame, offering proof.\n\nWhen Yao offered the world to Xu You, he said: “The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—how can its light compare? The seasonal rains have fallen, yet I still irrigate—how exhausting is my labor in vain! If you, Master, were to stand forth, the world would govern itself, yet I remain in this seat. I see my own inadequacy. I beg to yield the world to you.” Xu You replied: “You have governed the world, and the world is already well governed. If I were to replace you, would I do so for the sake of fame? Fame is but the guest of reality—would I become a mere guest? The wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs only a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes only enough to fill its belly. Return, my lord, and rest! What use have I for the world? Even if the cook neglects his kitchen, the priest would not step beyond the sacrificial vessels to take his place.”\n\nBuilding upon the preceding passage, the discussion of Song Rongzi distinguishes three grades of individuals: those who forget themselves for fame, those who forget merit, and those who forget fame itself. Here, Yao’s abdication of the world, though it demonstrates forgetfulness of merit, still clings to the renown of abdication. Xu You’s refusal of the world, though it demonstrates forgetfulness of fame, remains self-satisfied—thus failing to forget the self. Only the divine person of Guye, described below, embodies the great transformation of the transcendent sage who has forgotten all distinctions, thereby revealing the true realization of freedom.\n\nJian Wu said to Lian Shu: “I heard Jie Yu speak words vast yet groundless, drifting away without return. I was alarmed by his speech—it seemed as boundless as the Milky Way, wildly extravagant, far removed from human sensibilities.” Lian Shu asked: “What did he say?” Jian Wu replied: “On the distant Mount Guye dwells a divine person. Her skin is like ice and snow, her grace like that of a maiden. She does not eat the five grains, but draws sustenance from wind and dew. She rides the clouds and qi, harnesses flying dragons, and roams beyond the four seas. Her spirit is concentrated, so that no blight or pestilence arises where she passes, and the harvests ripen in due season. Yet I deem this madness and do not believe it.”\n\nLian Shu said: “Indeed, the blind cannot partake in the spectacle of patterns, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums. Is it only the body that suffers deafness and blindness? The mind, too, may be afflicted. Your words reveal just such a condition—like a woman’s limited understanding. This person, this power, pervades the ten thousand things, merging with them as one. Were she to seek order in the world, who would trouble themselves with the wearisome business of governance? This person is untouched by harm, for things cannot injure her. Though the great floods rise to the heavens, she does not drown; though the fiercest drought melts metal and stone and scorches the mountains, she does not feel the heat. Even the dust and chaff of her virtue could mold and cast a Yao or Shun—who would deign to make worldly affairs her concern?”\n\nThis passage elucidates the power of the perfected ones—the transcendent, the divine, the sages—who ride the heavens and earth and master the six qi, revealing the true nature of the Great Ancestral Master. Were such a person compelled to engage with the world, she would become a sage emperor or enlightened king; yet if she remained unattached to governance, her mere leavings and remnants would suffice to transform the world. She would never deign to toil like Yao or Shun, exhausting herself in the affairs of state. This is the ultimate expression of governing through non-action—only such a person could achieve it.\n\nThe people of Song peddled ceremonial caps to Yue, where the people cut their hair and tattoo their bodies, finding no use for such things. This illustrates how Yao, valuing the world, offered it to Xu You, unaware that Xu You had no use for it—just as the Yue found no use for the caps. Yao governed the people and brought order to the realm. Yet when he visited the four masters on the southern slopes of Mount Guye by the Fen River, he was suddenly and utterly stripped of his attachment to the world.\n\nThis passage clarifies Yao’s abdication to Xu You and Xu You’s refusal: though Xu You declined the world, he could not free Yao from his attachment to it, nor could he relinquish the renown of refusal, for he had not yet forgotten the self. But upon encountering the divine person, Yao instantly lost all claim to the world—proof of the divine person’s effortless mastery in governance.\n\nThe intent behind this entire work culminates in this single passage—it is not merely the concluding lines of the *Free and Easy Wandering* chapter. Though Zhuangzi’s prose may appear unbounded, flowing freely and indulging in whimsy, its underlying structure is meticulously precise and unassailable. Even in the *Free and Easy Wandering* alone, the depth of its meaning is so profound. Having resolved the meaning of *free and easy wandering*, the text then employs *parables* and *weighted words*, followed by *unconstrained speech*—much like the spirit of jest and theater, through which the author expresses his own heart’s concerns.\n\nPeople dismiss Zhuangzi’s words as grand but useless, yet the fault lies not in the words but in their inability to grasp that the usefulness of the \"useless\" is the greatest use of all. Thus, he invokes Huizi to illustrate this point. Huizi said to Zhuangzi: \"The King of Wei bestowed upon me the seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to bear fruit weighing five *dan*. When I used it to hold water, its weight was such that I could not lift it alone. When I split it to make a ladle, its vastness left no place to store it. It was not that it wasn’t impressively large—it was simply useless, so I smashed it.\"\n\nZhuangzi replied: \"You are truly inept at putting great things to use. There was a man from Song skilled in making a salve that prevented chapped hands. For generations, his family earned their living by washing silk floss. A traveler heard of this and offered a hundred pieces of gold for the formula. The family gathered to deliberate: ‘For generations, we’ve washed silk floss and barely made a few coins. Now, in a single morning, we could sell this skill for a hundred gold—let us give it to him.’ The traveler acquired the formula and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue invaded, the King of Wu appointed the traveler as a general. That winter, they fought a naval battle against Yue, and Wu decisively defeated them. The king then granted the traveler a fiefdom. The ability to prevent chapped hands was the same in both cases, yet one man gained a fief while another remained a silk-washer—all because of how they applied it. Now, you have a gourd of five *dan*—why not consider making it into a great float and drifting upon the rivers and lakes? Instead, you fret that it is too large to contain anything. Clearly, your mind is as tangled as the heart of a *peng* plant!\"\n\nThis passage reveals Zhuangzi’s self-fashioned doctrine of the *free and easy* divine person, illustrating the great use of the \"useless\"—a reflection of his own sentiments, lamenting that the world fails to recognize true wisdom. Huizi was Zhuangzi’s closest friend in life, so he playfully teased him to convey his meaning. It also subtly suggests that even a sage requires a world that understands him before he can be put to use in his time. Though the words seem playful, the heart behind them is deeply earnest. Such writing must be appreciated for its spirit, not parsed literally—it possesses a distinct flavor, what one might call the \"separate delight of poetry.\" Many passages in later chapters employ similar allegorical intent, which scholars must not overlook.\n\nEarlier, the text addressed the failure to use greatness properly but had not yet expounded on the use of the \"useless.\" Thus, the following passage uses the great tree to develop this idea. Huizi said to Zhuangzi: \"I have a great tree—people call it the *chu*. Its trunk is swollen and gnarled, unfit for the carpenter’s line, and its branches are twisted, defying compass and square. Even if planted by the roadside, no craftsman would glance at it. Your words, too, are grand but useless, and so the world unanimously rejects them.\"\n\nZhuangzi replied: \"Have you never observed the wildcat or the weasel? They crouch low, lying in wait for their prey, leaping east and west without regard for height or depth. Yet they fall into traps and snares, dying in nets. Now consider the yak: vast as a thundercloud, it is too large to be caught in snares. But you have a great tree and fret over its uselessness—why not plant it in the land of nothingness, where you might wander in its shade, resting beneath it without care? It will not be felled by axes, nor will harm come to it. If it is of no use, what affliction can befall it?\"\n\nNow the yak of the southern mountains—its size is like a cloud hanging in the sky (though the yak may not truly be so vast, this is but a figurative expression). Such magnitude it possesses, yet it cannot catch a mouse (though the yak may loom as large as the clouds, even so vast a creature cannot seize a mouse—this speaks to the utter greatness that cannot stoop to petty trifles). You, sir, have a great tree and fret over its uselessness (since you already possess this great tree, why lament its lack of use? Let it remain useless). Why not plant it in the land of nothingness (this is Zhuangzi’s self-allusion—though vast and useless, if the world does not require its use, why not simply leave it in a place of no use?), the boundless wilds (this phrase, like \"land of nothingness,\" alludes to the realm of the Dao)? There you may wander carefree at its side, roam at ease beneath its boughs (the perfected person, though useless, wanders with the Dao, so that whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, joy abounds—what cause for concern is there?). It will not be felled by axes (the tree, being already useless, and planted where none tread, will not suffer the bite of blades—this mirrors the sage, who seeks nothing from the world and thus escapes its harm), nor will any thing bring it harm (being of no use and placed beyond the reach of men, what harm could befall it?). If it is of no use, where lies its affliction?\n\nThis passage uses Huizi to mock Zhuangzi’s uselessness, while Zhuangzi in turn mocks Huizi’s pursuit of fame and profit through petty cleverness—a pursuit as perilous as the wildcat that cannot escape the snare. But the perfected person, seeking nothing from the world, though deemed useless, finds joy in the Dao and lives out his natural span. Is this not the great use of preserving life and nurturing the Way? Thus, what appears useless may yet be free from affliction. Though these words are playful, they reveal Zhuangzi’s contentment with his own heart—how could those of petty understanding ever comprehend it?\n\n**On the Equality of Things**\nThe term \"equality of things\" refers to the debates and disputes of people across ages, where no true sage of great awakening exists, and each school clings to its own limited knowledge and narrow views, insisting on its own rightness. Since each person takes their own perspective as correct, all others in the world must be wrong, leaving not a single truth to be found. At the highest level, this manifests in the mutual refutations of the Confucians and Mohists; at the lower, in the clashing opinions of the various schools, each asserting its own rightness while condemning others. Thus, in the end, no one can rightly harmonize them. The difficulty of equalizing such debates has persisted for ages—all due to the failure to see clearly.\n\nZhuangzi’s intent in proposing the equality of things is that only a truly awakened person, one who has forgotten self and others, can perceive with true knowledge and true awakening, dissolving the distinctions between self and other, and merging with the great Dao. In this way, the debates over things need not be forcibly equalized, for right and wrong naturally vanish, leaving no trace of self, other, right, or wrong. This is the great purport of the equality of things.\n\nThe text begins by establishing the forgetting of self as paramount. If one does not cling to one’s own views or insist on one’s own rightness, one must awaken to the true master within, shedding the false self of flesh and form. Then one naturally merges with the realm of the Dao. This is the practice of equalizing things. Only when one reaches the great transformation where self and other are both forgotten—like the butterfly dream—does one attain the true realization of the equality of things.\n\nThe text opens with the three *lai* (sounds) to set forth its meaning. The *lai* are akin to mechanisms. The *earth-lai*—where all sounds arise in unison—is the mechanism of a single *qi*, its myriad tones and echoes devoid of right or wrong. The *human-lai*, though crafted by human hands (such as bamboo flutes), bends without cunning intent, and thus requires no further discussion. As for the *heaven-lai*, it is the speech of all people, arising naturally from the marvel of the heavenly mechanism. Yet most people cling to the self-view, making cunning the master, unlike the wind that blows through the *earth-lai*. Hence, the conflict of right and wrong arises. If one speaks without cunning, then there is neither affirmation nor negation—how could there be right or wrong between self and other? This is the foundational intent of its argument.\n\nLaozi said: \"Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows? Empty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it yields. Excessive speech leads to exhaustion—better to abide in the center.\" This passage from the *Qi Wu* (Equalizing Things) is clearly its annotation. By this, one grasps more than half its meaning.\n\nNan Guo Ziqi (a man of the Dao who dwelled in reclusion at Nan Guo), leaning against his armrest in seated stillness (sitting upright, suddenly forgetting his body, like Yanzi’s \"fasting of the mind\"—this is the first step in the practice of equalizing things), looked up to the sky and sighed (laughing at himself for forgetting his body), his form slackened (his body dissolved, as if he no longer perceived it), seemingly having lost his counterpart (this fleshly form is but the counterpart of the true lord; now, suddenly forgetting it, he seemed to have lost his counterpart).\n\nYan Cheng Ziyou (a disciple of Ziqi) stood attending before him and asked: \"What is this? (How can you be so at ease as to appear thus?) The body may indeed be made like withered wood, but can the mind truly be made like dead ashes? (Having forgotten the body, the mechanism of the mind ceases, so the mind becomes like dead ashes. Ziyou asks: Can body and mind truly be made like withered wood and dead ashes?) The one who leans here today is not the same as the one who leaned here before. (Before, when I saw you leaning, there was still vitality; now, you are like withered wood and dead ashes—vastly different from before.)\"\n\nZiqi replied: \"Yan (Ziyou’s name), is it not well that you ask this? (Your question is far from good!) Today, I have lost my self (I refer to my true self; *losing the self* means forgetting this fleshly form)—do you understand? (Do you grasp what it means for me to lose my self?)\" This *Qi Wu Lun* (Equalizing Things) begins with the loss of the self to reveal that the right and wrong of the world all stem from the self-view. To equalize things, one must take the forgetting of the self as the foremost principle. Thus, the sage of *xiaoyao* (free and easy wandering) must first forget the self, then forget merit, and then forget fame. This is the intent of its argument.\n\n\"You have heard of the *human-lai* (the sound of flutes and pipes), but not the *earth-lai* (as in the passage below, where the long wind rises and the myriad hollows roar in unison); you have heard of the *earth-lai*, but not the *heaven-lai* (the speech of the multitude, which arises spontaneously from the heavenly mechanism)!\"\n\nIn introducing the *Qi Wu Lun* with the three *lai*, the aim is to awaken people to the source of their own speech—its arising from the heavenly mechanism. If one can forget cunning and speak without intent, like the wind blowing through hollows, how could there be right or wrong? Understanding the purpose of these three *lai* reveals the greater meaning.\n\nZiyou said: \"May I ask the method (of the three *lai*)?\" Ziqi replied (first explaining the *earth-lai*): \"The great clod (heaven and earth) exhales *qi*, and this is called wind (the great wind is the exhalation of heaven and earth, like the *xiaoyao*—the wind of the sixth month is called *xi*, playing with the workings of creation). When it does not arise (when the wind does not stir), the myriad hollows remain silent. When it arises, the myriad hollows roar in anger. Have you alone not heard the *liu-liu* (the sound of the long wind as it first rises)?\n\nThe towering forests and rugged mountains, the hollows of great trees a hundred spans in girth (in the deep mountains, great trees with trunks a hundred spans wide are riddled with hollows)—some resemble noses (the shapes of the hollows below resemble the two nostrils of a human nose), some mouths (like a human mouth lying horizontally), some ears (like a human ear hanging askew), some beams (*ji*, with square holes resembling a beam’s mortise), some rings (with round holes like a ring), some mortars (with holes narrow inside and wide outside, like a pounding mortar), some depressions (with long holes like a water-filled depression), some puddles (with shallow holes like a muddy puddle. The above describes the forms of the hollows; below, their sounds):\n\nSome rush (like water dashing against stone), some *xiao* (resembling the sound of a whistling arrow), some scold (like a person scolding an ox), some inhale (like a person drawing breath, the sound faint as if withdrawing), some cry out (like a person shouting loudly), some wail (like a low, mournful howl), some whimper (like a dog’s faint, lingering bark), some bark (like a dog’s sharp bark. The above describes the sounds of the hollows).\n\nThe first gust (the leading wind) sings softly, and the following gusts respond in harmony. A gentle breeze (*ling* wind) elicits a faint chorus (as the wind blows, the myriad hollows sound in harmony), a whirlwind (*piao* wind) elicits a great chorus, and when the fierce wind ceases, the myriad hollows fall silent (the sounds of the hollows arise with the wind’s stirring;...\"\n\nWhen the great wind ceases, the myriad hollows fall utterly silent—this shows that sound has no intrinsic existence.\n\nYet have you alone not observed the *tiao-tiao* and *diao-diao*? (These are the lingering tremors of grasses and trees after the wind has stilled. Though the wind has ceased, the grasses and trees continue to sway without end. This subtly compares the world’s disputes: the one who sang is gone, yet people still cling to their threads of argument, each insisting on their own rightness.)\n\nThis parable of the long wind and the myriad hollows illustrates how the Great Dao, flowing with the Creator, disperses among the people like a long wind stirring the ten thousand hollows. Each person receives a different form and vessel, so their knowledge and perceptions vary, and their discourses diverge—just as the hollows, receiving the wind in varying degrees of strength and depth, produce sounds that differ in pitch, volume, and duration. This is why the multitude of opinions can never be uniform.\n\nThus, in ancient times, the one who sang first did so softly, while those who responded afterward did so with great vigor, each harmonizing according to what they heard—just as people inherit differing teachings from their masters. The one who sang first is already dead, yet those who follow still pursue the debate without end, like grasses and trees that continue to sway after the wind has stilled.\n\nYet the wind of heaven is but a single qi, arising naturally, with no cunning intent lurking within. Such are the words of the sage—uttered without premeditation. But alas, the multitude cling to their own views, speaking from cunning intent rather than from spontaneity, and thus is non born. The following passage states, *\"Words are not the blowing itself,\"* to clarify that the disparity in opinions arises entirely from cunning intent and self-attachment, a failure to perceive things clearly. This is the pivot of argumentation. Understand this, and you may grasp the *Qi Wu* (Equalizing Things).\n\nZiyou said: *\"The earthly *lai* (sound) is simply the myriad hollows; the human *lai* is the pipes of bamboo (since you already understand the earthly *lai*, the human *lai* must be the bamboo pipes—no need to elaborate further). May I ask about the heavenly *lai*?\"*\n\nZiqi replied: *\"The blowing of the ten thousand [hollows] differs, yet each finds its own resolution (the heavenly *lai* is the natural mechanism by which people utter words—the blowing of the ten thousand differs)... each takes what it will. Who then is the one that stirs them to anger?\"*\n\nGreat knowledge is broad and unhurried; petty knowledge is narrow and fussy.\nGrand words blaze forth; petty words chatter on.\nIn sleep, their spirits intertwine; in waking, their forms unfold.\nThey engage in contention, daily battling with their hearts.\nSome are slack, some are guarded, some are secretive.\nIn minor fears, they tremble; in great fears, they dissolve.\nTheir outbursts are like the release of a crossbow’s trigger—this is what it means to wield judgments of right and wrong.\nTheir persistence is like sworn oaths—this is what it means to cling to victory.\nTheir decline is like autumn and winter, speaking of their daily decay.\nTheir immersion in their doings makes them irrecoverable.\nTheir weariness is like a sealed vessel, speaking of their stagnation.\nThe heart near death cannot be revived.\nJoy and anger, sorrow and delight, anxiety and sighing, fickleness and fear, frivolity and indulgence, affectation and posturing—\npleasure arises from emptiness, steam gives rise to mushrooms.\nDay and night they alternate before us, yet none know where they sprout.\nEnough, enough!\nTo grasp this by dawn or dusk is to understand the source from which life arises.\nWithout that, there is no self; without the self, that has no place to abide (the form is but a borrowed vessel of the self, yet the true master has no place to lodge).\nTo grasp this is already close (as previously said, \"each takes what it will—who then is the one that stirs them to anger?\" Now, \"to grasp this\" refers to the \"this\" and \"that\" above, pointing to the true master. To recognize and grasp this true master is to draw near the Dao)—\nyet they do not know what moves it (the true master is the lord of the heavenly mechanism, its nature spontaneous, yet they do not know what moves it).\nAs if there were a true master (only now is the term \"true master\" explicitly raised, urging one to awaken to it—this is true knowledge),\nyet one cannot perceive its signs (朕兆: traces or omens. The true master resides within the human body, inherently formless, so seeking it yields no trace).\nIt can act (in daily conduct, nothing is not the true master’s doing) and is trustworthy (its true essence is real and reliable),\nyet its form is unseen (though sought, its form remains invisible—this echoes Laozi’s words: \"dim and dark, yet within it is essence; its essence is most real, within it is trust\").\nIt is real (substantial) yet formless (it has a true essence but no shape).\n\nEarlier, it spoke of differing understandings; this passage describes the varied states of people.\nYet people merely follow the impulses of their private emotions, unaware of the heavenly nature that governs them.\nLost in this true master, they pursue things without end, forgetting to return to the root.\nThus, what is most pitiable in people is this.\nEarlier, it said, \"each takes what it will—who then is the one that stirs them to anger?\" Here, it reveals the true master, urging one to awaken to it.\nWith true knowledge, one does not fall into the trap of right and wrong.\nThough the true master is formless, it governs the formed.\nTo awaken to it, one must see through this bodily frame, piece by piece, transcending form to perceive the wonder of the formless.\nThus, the following elaborates:\n\nThe hundred bones (the skeleton—humans have three hundred and sixty joints, collectively called the hundred bones),\nthe nine orifices (seven in the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose, plus two more, totaling nine),\nthe six viscera (the heart stores spirit, the liver stores the ethereal soul, the spleen stores intention, the lungs store the corporeal soul, the kidneys store will, and including the Gate of Life makes six—these encompass the entire body).\nAll are contained within, yet with whom do I share the closest bond?\n(赅: to encompass. The body is wholly contained, yet if all are considered \"me,\" which part is most intimately mine?\nIf one part is chosen, the rest are no longer mine;\nif all are cherished, there are many selves—who, then, is the true \"I\"?\nThis mirrors the Buddhist *Hīnayāna* method of analyzing form to reveal emptiness,\nand the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment*: \"The four elements separate—where now does this illusory body reside?\"\nThis is the first observation to break the attachment to self.)\n\nDo you delight in all of them? Is there partiality?\n(If every part of your body is cherished, partiality arises—there are many selves.)\nAre they all like servants and concubines?\n(If all parts are \"me\" yet lack a true ruler, they are but servants and concubines, mere instruments, not the master.)\nServants and concubines cannot govern one another (if all are mere instruments, who then manages them?).\nDo they take turns as ruler and subject?\n(If they alternate as ruler and subject, there is no fixed master.)\nIs there not a true lord within?\n(If no part is the master, this \"I\" is but an illusion—there must be a true lord within.\nSince the true lord resides in me, why do people not seek it?)\n\nIf sought and found, whether in feeling or not, it neither adds to nor detracts from its truth\n(the true lord is not bound to the bodily frame; it is naturally complete.\nIf one seeks and grasps its essence, the true lord gains nothing;\nif one fails to grasp it, the true lord loses nothing.\nThis is the unchanging, inherent nature—deluded, it does not diminish; awakened, it does not increase.\nThese words are precise, akin to the teachings of the inner school.\nYet they posit a true master, much like the Buddhist notion of the \"mind-consciousness.\")\n\nZhuangzi’s mind is vast, and thus his writing resembles the long wind stirring the hollows—its origin unknown.\nIn his words, from the first thought to the final construction, he encompasses beginning and end.\nYet his meaning is not immediately revealed, and his brush dances freely, leaving readers bewildered, unable to trace its thread.\n\nAt the outset of this chapter, speaking of the \"Heavenly Pipe,\" he declares: *\"The winds blow in ten thousand different ways, yet each finds its own resonance—who is it that stirs them to fury?\"* Here, he has already planted his feet firmly, urging the reader to look within and recognize the true master. Yet a single phrase cannot exhaust the matter, so from the earlier passage on *\"great knowledge, vast and unhurried\"* onward, he unfolds the meaning of *\"the winds blow in ten thousand different ways.\"* Only at *\"from dawn to dusk attaining this\"* does he begin to explain *\"each finds its own resonance—who is it that stirs them to fury?\"*—only then does he lift the veil to reveal the true master to others.\n\nThis passage now dismantles the notion of the bodily frame as the false self, urging one to cast it aside to perceive the true master—this is the true meaning of the chapter’s opening *\"mourning the self.\"* What follows laments the world’s delusion, chasing illusions instead of truth, a sorrow most profound, born of pity. *\"Once receiving its formed shape\"* (the true master is originally formless, yet upon taking this bodily shell as its form), *\"it does not perish until its end\"* (it does not briefly vanish but waits for this form to dissolve with transformation). *\"Clashing and grinding against things, its course runs like a gallop with no power to stop—is this not tragic?\"* (The true master, lord of this embodied self, knows not how to nurture itself, allowing it to engage with emotions, daily wrestling with the heart as if it were mere flesh and blood. Thus, it is wounded by external things, like a blade worn down by grinding, rushing forth without return—how can this not be tragic?) *\"A lifetime of toil without seeing success\"* (chasing desires, a lifetime of labor and exhaustion, yet never seeing what it has achieved, never knowing what it was all for), *\"wearily worn out, not knowing where it leads—how can this not be pitiful?\"* (Toiling for fame and profit, wearing out the body, a lifetime of drudgery until utterly spent, yet never knowing where it will end—human delusion runs so deep, how can this not be pitiful?) *\"People call it not dying—what good does it do?\"* (When people are so utterly lost, their form may persist, but if they are called \"not dead,\" what benefit is there?) *\"As the form transforms, the heart follows—can this not be called great sorrow?\"* (The heart races after illusions without cease, the bodily frame dissolves with it, and the heart drowns in delusion without awakening—can this not be called great sorrow?) *\"Is human life inherently so confused?\"* (Is human life by nature so devoid of understanding?) *\"Am I alone confused, or are there others who are not?\"* (Am I the only one lost in confusion, or are there those among others who are not? This is Zhuangzi’s stirring, impassioned plea.)\n\nThis passage speaks of the true master, once deluded by the bodily frame, wounded by desires, racing like fire without return, toiling without knowing rest, spending a lifetime in ignorance—can this not be called great sorrow? The deeper the delusion, the more one inverts right and wrong without realizing it. Thus, the following text reveals the words *\"right and wrong.\"*\n\n*\"If one follows the heart that is already formed\"* (the true heart that is originally present) *\"and takes it as one’s teacher, who is there who does not have a teacher?\"* (Everyone possesses this heart; all can seek it within and take it as their teacher.) *\"Why must it be those who know succession, whose hearts take themselves as their own?\"* (Why must it be the sages? For *\"those who know succession\"* are sages who recognize the bodily frame as a temporary vessel, thus forgetting form and taking the heart as their own.) *\"Even the foolish possess it!\"* (Even the foolish share in this!) *\"Before the heart is fully realized, there is right and wrong\"* (before one awakens to the originally present true heart, one establishes notions of right and wrong), *\"this is like arriving in Yue today when you set out yesterday\"* (claiming to have arrived when one has not—such is the self-deception of right and wrong). *\"Thus, taking what is not as what is\"* (claiming what is not attained as attained, pretending ignorance is knowledge). *\"Taking what is not as what is\"* (those who deceive themselves in this way), *\"even the divine Yu could not know\"* (though the sage Yu’s knowledge was vast, he could only know what he had truly attained; for those who take what is not as what is, how could he know them?) *\"What then can I do?\"* (If even Yu cannot know them, what can I do? This emphasizes how difficult it is to speak of the great Dao with such people.)\n\nThis passage speaks of the root of right and wrong, arising from those who deceive themselves, pretending ignorance is knowledge, clinging to their own views as absolute truth—thus, everything else is wrong. They have not awakened to the true knowledge that is originally present but cling to deluded knowledge as truth. Even sages can do nothing with such people. What a pity that the true heart, already present, is obscured and unrecognized—how lamentable! Because they do not awaken to the true heart, they cling to their own views as right and others as wrong—this is the root of the disease of right and wrong.\n\nWhat follows clarifies the central meaning of the *\"Discourse on Equalizing Things.\"* *\"Words are not the wind’s blowing\"* (earlier, he expounded on how people do not awaken to the true master but cling to their own views. Without following the originally present true heart but clinging to deluded perceptions, each person’s knowledge and views differ. Now he enters the *\"Discourse on Things,\"* saying that people’s words arise from the machinations of the heart, not like the wind blowing through hollows). *\"Those who speak have their words\"* (thus, what they speak does not come from the true master but from the words of a scheming heart). *\"What they speak is merely unsettled\"* (relying on one’s own biased views, what they speak is never definitively right or wrong). *\"Do they truly have words? Or have they never truly spoken?\"* (This urges one to turn inward: are these words originally present?)\n\nHave they never truly spoken? This single question alone suffices to make one realize. And thus, the work of the *\"Discourse on Equalizing Things\"* is briefly revealed here.\n\nIs it different from the chick’s cry? (The chick’s cry refers to the peeping of a bird about to hatch from its shell—this is the sound of Heaven’s mechanism, arising entirely without intention. Yet human speech, born of intention, differs from the chick’s cry. This urges one to reflect.) Is there then debate? Or is there no debate? (Debate here means contention between opposing views. It asks: when one regards speech as no different from the chick’s cry, does debate arise? Or does it not? This prompts one to observe the moment of speech and turn inward.)\n\nThis passage begins to clarify the inequality of things’ discourse. First, it points out that words and sounds are fundamentally without right or wrong. If one allows Heaven’s mechanism to express itself, then there is no debate over right and wrong. Yet the essence of equalizing things lies precisely in the absence of speech, and this principle has already been revealed here. It urges one to work at this point, to see through Heaven’s mechanism, and then right and wrong will naturally dissolve.\n\nFrom *\"Now, words are not like the wind’s blowing\"* onward, through to the end of the *\"Completion and Deficiency\"* chapter—*\"this is called illumination\"*—spans a single great section of over seven hundred and forty characters. Each passage brims with vitality, and the thread is most difficult to follow; only with careful and deep observation can one grasp its subtlety.\n\nWhat follows directly points out that those who engage in right and wrong are the kind who lose the true and cling to delusion. Where is the Dao obscured, that there should be truth and falsehood? (Obscured means hidden and unclear. The Great Dao is originally without truth or falsehood. Here, the question is posed: Why is the Dao unclear, giving rise to truth and falsehood?) Where are words obscured, that there should be right and wrong? (The words of the true person are originally without right or wrong. The question is: Why are true words obscured, giving rise to right and wrong?) Where does the Dao go that it does not abide? (If the Dao has no truth or falsehood, then there is nothing to accept or reject—where would it not abide?) Where do words abide that they cannot be spoken? (If words arise naturally, following Heaven’s mechanism, then what is there that cannot be said? Yet because the Dao is obscured, words become false; when words are partial, right and wrong arise from them.)\n\nThe Dao is obscured by petty accomplishments (The Dao is not inherently obscured, but it is hidden from those of limited understanding. What they accomplish is small, so the Great Dao remains unmanifest). Words are obscured by florid ornamentation (Florid ornamentation refers to empty, insubstantial speech. Because words do not convey the Dao but instead indulge in superficial embellishment, the profound is obscured). Thus arise the right and wrong of the Confucians and Mohists (Here, the origin of right and wrong is finally pointed out, as the discussion is directed specifically at the Confucians and Mohists. The Confucians advocate elaborate funerals, while Mozi rejects them, leading to mutual criticism. At the time, Zhuangzi was a contemporary of Mencius; Mencius refuted Yang Zhu, and Mozi said, *\"How could I delight in debate?\"* Thus arose the debate over right and wrong. Hence, Confucians and Mohists are addressed together). They affirm what the other denies and deny what the other affirms (The Confucians regard elaborate funerals as right, which Mozi denies—thus, they affirm what the other denies. Mozi regards frugal mourning as right, which the Confucians reject—thus, they deny what the other affirms). If you wish to affirm what the other denies and deny what the other affirms, then nothing is better than illumination (The Confucians and Mohists mutually affirm and deny, yet neither has grasped the Great Dao; each merely clings to their own views, without necessarily being truly right. If you wish to affirm what the other denies and deny what the other affirms, nothing is better than illuminating the Great Dao, and then the debate over right and wrong will vanish).\n\nThis passage directly identifies the origin of right and wrong as arising from the Confucians and Mohists. Though there were recluses who criticized them at the time, the Confucians and Mohists were the first to raise the issue. The implication is that while Yang Zhu and Mozi had already lost sight of benevolence and righteousness, the Confucians had also failed to grasp the Great Dao. Thus, neither school possessed an absolute truth. This serves as the foundation for the argument. For the debate over right and wrong originated with the Confucians and Mohists, spread to the various masters, and later focused specifically on Hui Shi—all of them people who failed to understand, and thus lost the Dao.\n\nBelow, it first clarifies that right and wrong are originally absent, yet people do not realize this and so cling to their own views, giving rise to right and wrong. There is nothing that is not the other (If one person in the world clings to their own views, then everyone else becomes \"the other.\" Hence, there is nothing that is not the other). There is nothing that is not right (If one person regards themselves as right, then everyone regards themselves as right, and thus nothing in the world is not right. Hence, there is nothing that is not right). From the other, one does not see (If one only sees the other’s wrong, then one does not see one’s own wrong). Through self-knowledge, one knows it (If one knows one’s own wrong, then one knows that nothing in the world is not right. Hence, *\"through self-knowledge, one knows it.\"*). Thus it is said: the other arises from the right (The other’s wrong arises from my right), and the right also depends on the other (My right also depends on the other’s wrong. Because people do not know themselves, they cling to their own right, and thus cannot dissolve right and wrong).\n\nThis passage speaks of how people suffer from not knowing themselves, and so regard their own rightness as absolute. If they were to exchange places and observe from the other’s perspective, then self and other would both be forgotten, right and wrong would dissolve, and one would see that right and wrong were originally absent.\n\nBelow, it further clarifies that right and wrong are fundamentally absent, arising only through opposition. The other (the other’s wrong) and the right (my right) are the theories that arise from opposition (Opposition here means comparison and contrast. Right and wrong are originally absent, arising only through the opposition of self and other). Nevertheless (the following turns to show that opposition has no end), as soon as there is life, there is death; as soon as there is death, there is life (The opposition of right and wrong is like life and death: life gives way to death, death gives way to life, endlessly cycling without end).\n\nIf one takes the word \"death\" as \"annihilation,\" this too is profound); as soon as there is approval, there is disapproval, and as soon as there is disapproval, there is approval (what is right is approved, what is not is disapproved. Thus, there is never a time when both are approved). This arises from that right, and that right arises from this wrong (this right exists because of that wrong, and that right exists because of this wrong—all due to the failure to know and see for oneself). Therefore, the sage does not follow the path of others but illuminates it by the heavens, and this too is \"right\" (the sage does not adhere to the world’s right and wrong but alone illuminates the natural great Dao, thus what is truly right is right, hence it is also called \"right.\" This means the sage’s \"right\" is the true right seen through illumination, unlike ordinary people who cling to their own views as right and falsely deem others wrong. This is Laozi’s \"modeling oneself after Heaven\").\n\nThis passage explains that the right and wrong of the world are deluded, obstinate illusions, ceaselessly clashing between self and other. Only the sage does not follow the crowd’s views but truly knows and alone illuminates the natural great Dao, clearly seeing what is truly right—hence it is also called \"right.\" This is vastly different from the multitude, so the word \"also\" distinguishes it. Earlier, it was said: rather than engaging in the mutual right-wrong disputes of Confucians and Mohists, it is better to be *illuminated*—*illumination* here means seeing through. Thus, the sage illuminates by the heavens, substantiating and clarifying it. This is the work of *equalizing things*, meaning that seeing through eliminates opposition. The following text elaborates on the meaning of *transcending opposition* and concludes with \"it is better to be illuminated.\"\n\n\"This is also that, and that is also this\" (following the sage’s work of seeing through, one realizes that my right is that wrong, and that wrong is also my right. Viewed thus, where is there right and wrong?). \"That also has its right and wrong, and this also has its right and wrong\" (viewed thus, right and wrong are both forgotten). Is there truly that (that wrong) and this (my right)? Or is there truly no that and this? (If right and wrong merge into the great Dao, is there truly right and wrong? Or is there truly no right and wrong?)\n\nWhen that and this find no counterpart, it is called the *pivot of the Dao* (when right and wrong are forgotten, all is level and unified, transcending all opposition—thus that and this find no counterpart. *Counterpart* means opposition. Transcending opposition is the wondrous pivot of the Dao). Once the pivot is grasped at the center of the ring, it can respond endlessly (a ring is not square; its emptiness at the center makes it lively and responsive, like the Dao’s emptiness. If one attains this empty pivot of the Dao, one can respond to endless change). \"This\" is also an endless, \"not-this\" is also an endless (when right and wrong dissolve into the great Dao, \"this\" is also the Dao, and \"not-this\" is also the Dao—like Zhuangzi’s disparagement of Yao and Shun, this is unity with the great Dao).\n\nThus it is said: \"It is better to be illuminated\" (earlier, it was said: rather than the right-wrong disputes of Confucians and Mohists, it is better to be illuminated. When the sage sees through, right and wrong vanish, and one roams with the Dao—then everywhere is the abode of the great Dao. Thus it concludes: it is better to be illuminated). This passage explains that when the sage sees through, right and wrong naturally vanish, harmonizing with the great Dao and responding endlessly. Its wonder lies entirely in *illumination*. This urges people to awaken to illumination as the true right, so that the judgments of things need not be equalized but equalize themselves. This is Laozi’s \"Heaven follows the Dao.\"\n\nBelow, the text uses pointing at a horse as a metaphor for the original absence of right and wrong. To take pointing as not pointing (using my pointing finger to illustrate that another’s middle finger is not my pointing finger) is not as good as taking not-pointing to illustrate not-pointing (not as good as using that middle finger to illustrate that my pointing finger is not that middle finger). To take a horse as not a horse (the horse in the game of *shuanglu*—horses are distinguished as black and white, yet both are horses. If one takes that black horse to illustrate that my white horse is not that black horse) is not as good as taking not-a-horse to illustrate not-a-horse (not as good as using that black horse to illustrate that my white horse is not that black horse).\n\nHeaven and earth are one pointing, the myriad things are one horse (if one views this from another perspective, pointing and horse are not two, and right and wrong naturally vanish. Through the sage’s illumination, viewing it broadly, not only do the right and wrong of self and others vanish, but heaven and earth are born with me, and the myriad things are one with me. Thus, heaven and earth are one pointing, the myriad things are one horse—where then is the debate of self and other, right and wrong? This expands on the phrase \"it is better to be illuminated,\" revealing the sage’s illumination of the natural great Dao and explaining the meaning of *illumination*. Thus, it concludes the work of seeing through, truly dissolving right and wrong and equalizing the myriad things, urging people to focus on this).\n\nThis passage elaborates that when the sage sees through, right and wrong vanish, and heaven, earth, and the myriad things merge into one. The following explains the reason for this unity.\n\nWhat is approved is approved (if others approve, I also approve accordingly), what is disapproved is disapproved (if others disapprove, I also disapprove accordingly). The Dao is realized in its course (to follow the Dao is to act without failing to accord with it. *Realized* and *naturally so* need not be distinguished). Things are called so and thus are so (what is called so is naturally so). How is it so? (What is the reason for its being so?)\n\nThe \"so\" is so within one’s own mind (referring to what one deems so in one’s own heart). Why is it not so (why do others deem it not so)? It is not so in their \"not-so\" (what others deem not so is merely their own refusal to accept it as so). Things inherently have their \"so\" (each thing has its own definite \"so.\" For example, with medicinal herbs like ginseng and aconite: when ginseng is used, aconite is not so; yet when aconite is used, ginseng is not so. Thus, each thing has its own inherent reality). Things inherently have their \"permissible\" (what is impermissible here may be permissible elsewhere). There is nothing that is not so, nothing that is not permissible (from this perspective, all things under heaven are so, and all are permissible).\n\nThus, take the example of a *ting* (rafter) and a *ying* (pillar), *Li* (a man afflicted with leprosy) and Xi Shi (a beautiful woman), the vast (*hui*), the deceptive (*gui*), the cunning (*jué*), and the strange (*guài*). The Dao unites them as one (the length of the rafter and pillar, the beauty and ugliness of Li and Xi Shi, the shifting forms of the vast, deceptive, cunning, and strange—judged by human sentiment, they appear disparate, making it difficult to escape right and wrong. Yet viewed through the eye of the Dao, distinctions of long and short, beauty and ugliness vanish, all merging into perfect equality. Without awakening to the great Dao, one cannot harmonize the judgments of all things under heaven).\n\nTheir division is their completion (when a great tree is cut to make vessels, the division of the wood is the completion of the vessel); their completion is their destruction (though the vessel is complete, the wood is destroyed—how can one cling to a fixed notion of completion or destruction?). All things have no completion or destruction; they reunite as one (viewed from one side, there seems to be completion and destruction; viewed comprehensively, there is neither. Thus, they reunite as one. Observing all things this way, what right and wrong can there be?). This explains the meaning of \"heaven and earth as one finger, the myriad things as one horse\"—only when viewed through the eye of the Dao do the appearances of right and wrong vanish. With right and wrong dissolved, the Dao unites all as one.\n\nThe following points to the return to the Dao. Only the enlightened (those who comprehend the Dao) know that all is united as one. Thus, they do not insist on their own views but lodge them in the common (only those who comprehend the Dao know that all things are fundamentally one, so they do not cling to their own rightness, hence \"do not use.\" Not using their own views, they merely align with the sentiments of the multitude, the common people, following the views of others). The common is the useful (to explain \"common\" as \"useful\"—to adopt the likes and dislikes of the multitude). The useful is the harmonious (by being useful, one harmonizes with the will of the multitude). The harmonious is the attained (one who can harmonize with the Dao attains effortless mastery; with such attainment, there is no clinging to right or wrong). To aptly attain is to approach the Dao (those who comprehend the Dao and aptly attain it draw near to the Dao).\n\nFollowing this is so (those who comprehend the unity of all things, though myriad changes arise, never lose the Dao—thus, there is nowhere they are not so. Following this \"so\" is true \"so\"). Yet not knowing why it is so is called the Dao (to reach a state where all is harmonized, right and wrong vanish, and one flows with things without attachment—this is called the Dao, following Laozi’s principle of the Dao as natural spontaneity).\n\nThis section emphasizes that to forget right and wrong, one must be a sage who comprehends the Dao, knowing all things as one body. Thus, there is no right or wrong, no situation that is impermissible, only natural spontaneity—this is called the Dao. After much elaboration and exposition, this finally points to the single word \"Dao.\" The *yi* in \"following this is so\" marks the utmost limit: the sage’s utmost limit is simply to accord with the natural Dao—nothing more. Accord with the Dao, and all naturally returns to unity.\n\nThe following text states that the foolish strive to force unity, yet ultimately fail to achieve it. They exhaust their spirit and intelligence in pursuit of unity, unaware of their inherent sameness—this is called \"morning three.\" What is \"morning three\"? It is said: The monkey keeper (one who feeds monkeys) distributed acorns, saying, \"Three in the morning and four in the evening.\" All the monkeys were angry (the monkeys insisted that mornings should have more, evenings less). He then said, \"Then four in the morning and three in the evening.\" All the monkeys were pleased (the keeper merely reversed the original numbers). Name and reality were unchanged, yet joy and anger were employed—this too follows the \"so\" (the names \"three\" and \"four\" were the same, and the actual numbers were unchanged, but the monkeys, clinging to their own views, took \"four in the morning\" as necessarily right. They did not examine the reality but merely rejoiced in the name. These are those who cannot forget right and wrong, like Boyi and Shuqi).\n\nThus, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong, resting in the celestial balance (the celestial balance is the naturally equal state, utterly free of right and wrong. As previously said, \"illuminated by heaven,\" this concludes with \"resting in the celestial balance\"). This is called \"walking both paths\" (to walk both paths means that what is right may be walked, and what is wrong may also be walked. When harmonized by the Dao, there is nothing that right and wrong cannot encompass).\n\nThis passage speaks of those whose cultivation has not yet reached the state of naturalness, who forcibly strive to unify right and wrong, yet fail to awaken to the marvel of profound sameness. Such people can only affirm what they deem right but cannot forget what they deem wrong. They resemble Boyi, Shuqi, and Jiezi—though their conduct is lofty, they cannot escape a heart that resents the world and detests世俗. Likewise, the Confucians and Mohists each cling to one extreme as right, able only to approve what they approve, yet unable to approve what they disapprove. Though they depart from right and wrong, they ultimately cannot unify right and wrong. What they grasp is not inherently wrong, nor is it outside the Dao—only by each clinging to their own views as right do they become inverted. Thus, like the monkey keeper’s count of seven, where name and reality are the same, yet joy and anger arise differently, this is merely exhausting one’s spirit to force unity, unaware of the great sameness.\n\nOnly the sage harmonizes right and wrong, resting in the celestial balance, forgetting both and walking both paths. Thus, they can blend their light and move with the dust, merging without distinction—then there is nothing that can or cannot be done.\n\nThe following passage means: the ancients knew the state of original non-being and profound sameness, where right and wrong fundamentally did not exist. Later generations gradually declined. The ancients’ knowledge reached a certain point (the above spoke of those who do not know the Dao, exhausting their spirit to force unity yet ultimately failing. Thus, this speaks of the true persons of old, who possessed true knowledge in its ultimate state. \"Ultimate\" refers to the state of original non-being. The following provides evidence). Where does it reach? There are those who hold that there has never been any thing—this is the ultimate, the utmost, beyond which nothing can be added (before the state of original non-being, this is the utmost of the Dao, unknowable)! Next are those who acknowledge the existence of things yet have never established boundaries (though they have entered the realm of form, their knowledge remains uncarved, like the primordial chaos just divided, when human hearts were simple and unadorned—yet they had not yet established the boundaries of self and other. \"Boundaries\" refer to the divisions between this and that). Next are those who acknowledge boundaries yet have never established right and wrong (though they recognized divisions between self and other, their customs remained unrefined, and they had not yet developed the heart of right and wrong—thus they were not far from the Dao). The manifestation of right and wrong is the reason the Dao is diminished. The reason the Dao is diminished is the formation of attachment (attachment is private attachment to oneself. \"Formation\" refers to what was previously called \"once receiving its completed form\"—from then on, one strays from true nature, clings to this bodily form as the self, and thus the great Dao is greatly diminished). Is there truly completion and diminution? Is there truly no completion and diminution (if viewed from the perspective of the great Dao, is there truly completion and diminution? Without completion or diminution, if one truly sees that there is fundamentally no completion or diminution, then right and wrong naturally vanish)?\n\nThis passage explains that by straying from the great Dao, one forms the self, and once the self is formed, the Dao is diminished. Earlier, it was said, \"once receiving its completed form, one does not perish until its end\"—here, it finally reveals the word \"attachment\" as the root of self-clinging. By completing one’s own self, what is completed is small, and the great Dao is obscured, clarifying the earlier statement that \"the Dao is hidden in small completions.\" The following passage means: because what is completed is small, the people of the world toil endlessly throughout their lives yet never see their success. Thus, it illustrates this with three figures.\n\nBecause there is completion and diminution, Master Zhao played the zither (following the above, which said attachment forms and the Dao is diminished, it now shows that there is fundamentally no completion or diminution, thus citing three figures. Master Zhao was skilled at playing the zither, completing the legacy of his school; later, his son could not play the zither, diminishing the family’s reputation). Because there is no completion and diminution, Master Zhao did not play the zither (if he had not boldly established the reputation of playing the zither, then his son would not have had the story of diminishing the family’s reputation). Master Zhao’s playing of the zither, Shi Kuang’s guiding with his staff (further citing Shi Kuang as evidence. Shi Kuang, a man of great wisdom, was made blind and could not see the staff he used to guide himself—this is where completion and diminution arise), and Huizi’s leaning against the parasol tree (Huizi was a contemporary and friend of Zhuangzi, known for his eloquence and skill in debate. Zhuangzi’s meaning is that though Huizi’s debates were completed, the great Dao was diminished, thus comparing the completion and diminution of these two figures. To be skilled in debate yet not understand the Dao is like Shi Kuang’s wisdom yet blindness—even his son could not inherit his debating legacy, just as Master Zhao’s son could not play the zither)—the knowledge of these three nearly reached perfection, and thus their achievements were recorded in their later years (meaning they devoted themselves to their pursuits until the end of their lives). Only because they cherished their pursuits did they differ from others (speaking of the three figures’ deep devotion, which set them apart from others). Because they cherished their pursuits, they wished to make them known. Others (speaking of those who admired the knowledge of the three figures, while the three believed themselves to be ultimate and wished to display their abilities to others, meaning to teach them) sought to illuminate what could not be illuminated, and thus ended their lives in the obscurity of \"hard and white\" (this sentence refers specifically to Huizi, who had not truly understood the Dao yet forcibly claimed to understand it, and further sought to illuminate it for others—thus he achieved no great success and ended his life in the obscurity of \"hard and white\"). And his son ended with the threads of Zhao’s zither (the above spoke of Huizi’s completion and diminution; this speaks of Master Zhao’s completion and diminution)—his life achieved nothing (Huizi ended in the obscurity of \"hard and white,\" thus his life achieved nothing).\n\nThe son of Master Zhao learned his father’s zither, yet likewise ended his life without achievement. If Huizi did not engage in disputation and Master Zhao did not play the zither, what completion or diminution could there have been? The reason their Way was diminished lay precisely in their small achievements. If this can be called completion, then even I, too, am complete. If this cannot be called completion, then neither things nor I have achieved anything.\n\nThus, the radiance of perplexing doubt is what the sage contemplates—this \"radiance\" refers to concealing one’s brilliance and blending with the dust, echoing Laozi’s \"dim and murky,\" meaning to harmonize with the world without flaunting one’s views. To shine without dazzling is what the sage seeks. It is not that he does not employ his wisdom, but rather lodges it in the commonplace. This is what is meant by \"illuminating with clarity.\"\n\nThis passage concludes a far-reaching intent. From the opening \"speech is not mere breath\" downward, through \"where is the Dao hidden that there is truth and falsehood?\"—where the Dao is obscured by small achievements and words are concealed by splendor—even to the point of affirming what one denies and denying what one affirms, the argument rises in layers. The first culminates in \"nothing is better than clarity.\" The second, from the pivot of the Dao attaining the center of the ring, again concludes with \"nothing is better than clarity.\" Next, the analogy of the horse is introduced to illustrate that the Dao is universally interconnected, leading to the assertion that only the enlightened know this unity. Then, by not employing one’s views but lodging them in the ordinary, the character of the Dao is subtly revealed. The passage then borrows the example of the monkey-keeper, whose name and reality were not diminished, to expound upon the theme of diminution. The diminution of the Dao arises from the completion of attachment. This phrase, \"the completion of attachment,\" reaches back to the earlier assertion that \"once one receives one’s completed form\" and \"follows one’s completed mind as a teacher.\" The two meanings of \"completion\" imply: if one receives one’s form, this is the completion of attachment, and thus the Dao is diminished—here there is both completion and diminution. But if one follows one’s completed mind as a teacher, then there is fundamentally no completion or diminution. It is because of the completion of form that the distinctions of right and wrong become manifest—this is the root of it. Thus, the two ideas of \"completed form\" and \"completed mind\" form the backbone of the argument. The obscuring of the Dao by small achievements and the concealment of words by splendor have long existed, all stemming from a failure to awaken to the great Dao. Therefore, it was first declared: \"nothing is better than clarity.\" Then, discussing the pivot of the Dao, it was again said: \"thus, nothing is better than clarity.\" Now, having argued to the end, the conclusion returns to completion and diminution, pointing out that Huizi was the foremost among the unenlightened, clinging to the disputation of \"hard and white\" and obscuring his entire life. Thus, in the end, it highlights the sage who embodies the \"radiance of perplexing doubt\"—one who does not insist on being right—and returns to the enlightened one who does not employ his views but lodges them in the ordinary. This concludes with: \"this is what is meant by 'nothing is better than clarity.'\" The text, beginning from \"speech is not mere breath,\" spans over seven hundred characters before reaching this grand conclusion. Its words and meaning are like a snake in the grass—only its undulations and meanderings are visible, while its form remains elusive. Without a true eye, it cannot be easily discerned.\n\nAs for the completion and diminution of the three masters: Master Zhao’s pertains to the completion and diminution of his craft; Master Kuang’s, to the completion and diminution of his form; and Huizi’s, to the completion and diminution of the Dao. The overarching conclusion is that the Dao is obscured by small achievements and words are concealed by splendor, ultimately returning to the sage. This sage is the one previously described as \"only the enlightened know the universal interconnectedness\" and \"not employing one’s views but lodging them in the ordinary.\" Gazing deeply, one perceives the boundless waves and vital currents of this old master’s prose, where its intricacies defy grasp. The phrase \"this is what is meant by 'nothing is better than clarity'\" concludes the chapter beginning with \"speech is not mere breath.\" From here, the discussion shifts to the sage who embodies \"perplexing doubt,\" launching into the theme of the sage’s absence of right and wrong, leading to the following passage: \"without preference, following what is so\"—over two hundred and thirty characters forming another chapter.\n\nNow, suppose there is someone who speaks thus—do his words resemble this kind? By \"this,\" I refer to the sage of \"perplexing doubt,\" who is without right or wrong. Does this speaker’s discourse resemble such a sage? Or does it not? Whether it resembles or does not resemble, if one joins with it as a kind, then it differs in no way from that sage. Here, \"that\" refers to the sage mentioned above. This passage concludes the discussion of the two sages, urging self-realization and the forgetting of one’s own rightness.\n\nThough this is so, let me attempt to speak of it. Though there is fundamentally no right or wrong, this has not yet been thoroughly penetrated. Therefore, let me try to discuss it.\n\nThere is that which has a beginning (this refers to Laozi’s \"The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth\"), there is that which has not yet had a beginning (here, even \"having a beginning\" is absent—meaning \"without beginning.\" This corresponds to Laozi’s \"These two emerge together but differ in name\"), and there is that which has not yet had \"that which has not yet had a beginning\" (here, even \"not yet having\" is absent, corresponding to Laozi’s \"Mystery upon mystery—the gateway of all subtleties.\" This speaks solely of the origin of the formless Dao).\n\nThere is that which is \"having\" (this \"having\" refers to heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things, as in Laozi’s \"The named is the mother of the ten thousand things\"), there is that which is \"non-having\" (from the existence of heaven and earth, one infers \"The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.\" This is to trace from the formed back to the formless origin of the Dao), there is that which has not yet had \"non-having\" (this means that the formed heaven, earth, and ten thousand things arise from the formless, yet within the essence of the Dao, neither \"having\" nor \"non-having\" is established, hence it is said \"not yet had\"), and there is that which has not yet had \"that which has not yet had non-having\" (the above speaks of both \"having\" and \"non-having\" as absent; here, even \"both absent\" is absent, utterly beyond all designation. Only then does one reach the realm of the Dao’s profound sameness, thus naming it the wondrous Dao of emptiness and non-being).\n\nSuddenly, there is \"having\" and \"non-having\" (within the essence of the Dao, there are no names or forms, not a single dharma established—hence it is forcibly called the vast and empty Dao. Yet suddenly, \"having\" and \"non-having\" arise, and none know what causes this. Earlier, it was said, \"as if there were a true master,\" yet one cannot discern its traces. Now, turning back to reflect, it subtly points to this), yet it remains unknown whether \"having\" and \"non-having\" are truly \"having\" or \"non-having\" (within the essence of the Dao, neither \"having\" nor \"non-having\" is established. Even now, who causes them to be \"having\" or \"non-having\"? This is what was meant by \"as if there were a true master,\" yet its traces cannot be found. Now, upon returning to observe this, even \"having\" and \"non-having\" are absent—how then could there be any debate over right and wrong?).\n\nNow, I have already spoken (if \"having\" and \"non-having\" are both absent, all names and forms are extinguished—how could there be any debate through words? Yet I have already spoken within the realm of wordlessness, though my words are fundamentally without words), yet it remains unknown whether what I have called \"speaking\" is truly speaking or truly not speaking (I have now already spoken, but my words are merely words of wordlessness, as in the earlier example of the fledgling’s cry, which arises from the celestial mechanism without any trace of right or wrong. People see only my wordless words—are they truly words? Or truly not words? If one awakens to these wordless words, then right and wrong naturally vanish).\n\nThe preceding explanation of words was not like the wind’s blowing—it was speech arising from a calculating mind. Now, Zhuangzi has spoken of the state of forgetting words and attaining profound sameness, meaning that though I have now spoken, my words arise from the true master and are words of wordlessness. If one comprehends my wordless words, then one forgets words and returns to unity.\n\nThe following passage further explains forgetting words and returning to unity, where great and small are the same, and right and wrong are utterly absent. Only thus is it truly so.\n\nIn the world, nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; nothing lives longer than an infant who dies young, yet Pengzu is short-lived (these two lines are exceedingly difficult to grasp. Having already discussed returning to the origin of the Dao, Zhuangzi now unifies right and wrong through the Dao. If one observes the formed through the formed, then great and small, long life and early death are fixed and unchangeable. But if one observes the formed through the Dao, then an autumn hair, though small, embodies the vastness of the void, while Mount Tai, though formed, is but a pebble within it. Thus, nothing is greater than an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small. An infant who dies young, though short-lived, shares the same origin as the beginningless, while Pengzu is but a single thing within it. Thus, nothing lives longer than an infant who dies young, yet Pengzu is short-lived. If one observes thus through the Dao, then the small is not small, and the great is not great; the short-lived is not short-lived, and the long-lived is not long-lived. In this way, heaven and earth share the same root, and the ten thousand things are one body—how could there be right and wrong?).\n\nHeaven and earth are born together with me, and the ten thousand things and I are one (observing through the Dao, the ten thousand things are one body, thus heaven and earth are born together with me, and the ten thousand things and I are one). Since we are already one, can there be speech? (Having become one, self and things are both forgotten—what more is there to say?) Since we have already called it \"one,\" can there be no speech? (Having already named it \"one,\" how could words not arise?) The one and words make two (the formless \"one\" is now named \"one,\" thus two \"ones\" become two), and two and one make three (now, with words describing these two \"ones,\" they become three through mutual dependence). From this point onward, even the most skilled mathematician cannot reckon it—how much less the ordinary person! (From the mutual dependence of words to become three, dependence continues endlessly. Even one skilled in calculation cannot exhaust it—how much less the ordinary person!)\n\nThus, from non-being to being, one reaches three—how much more from being to being! (From non-being just reaching being, one has already become three—how much more from being to being, which is boundless!) Do not proceed thus, but rest here (not proceeding means settling the mind before \"not yet having\" began, where it remains serene, constant, and unchanging. Earlier, it was said that the multitude follow \"this\" and thus have right and wrong, while the sage does not follow but illuminates it through heaven—this is also \"resting here.\" Thus, carrying the discussion to before \"not yet having things,\" heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things merge into one, never departing from the Dao. Only this is truly so).\n\nThe sage who \"follows this\" does so by taking non-proceeding as \"this\"—this is precisely illuminating it through heaven. (Here lies the textual correspondence!)\n\nThis passage elucidates the wondrous union with the mysterious, the shared root of heaven and earth, and the oneness of the ten thousand things. Settling the mind in the great Dao, without arising distinctions, one is utterly free from right and wrong—this alone is true. Thus it concludes: \"Do not proceed thus, but rest here.\"\n\nBelow, the text again raises the word \"this,\" the root of right and wrong. The Dao has never had boundaries (it originally lacks form or distinctions between self and others), nor has it ever had constancy (constancy here means rigid fixation, the source of right-and-wrong assertions. Following the Dao in speech, there is no \"can\" or \"cannot,\" no fixed right or wrong). Yet by taking \"this\" as real, boundaries arise (merely grasping a single \"this\" gives rise to the distinctions of right and wrong).\n\nLet us speak of these boundaries: there is left and right, there are relationships and righteousness, there are divisions and debates, there are competitions and conflicts—these are called the eight virtues (meaning that from non-being to being, the duality of being and non-being already forms opposition. Once being exists, there arises the order of left and right; with left and right, there are relationships and righteousness; with relationships and righteousness, there are divisions and debates; and from these, competitions and conflicts emerge. These arise in succession, fixed and unchanging. The root of the illness lies in the single word \"this\"—for example, taking left as right makes right utterly unchangeable. Worldly sentiments regard such distinctions as skill, hence calling them the eight virtues. Here, \"virtue\" means capability).\n\nEarlier, the discussion moved from delusion to awakening, reaching the root of the great Dao, and the phrase \"rest here\" concluded it. Here, it raises the point again: the great Dao originally has no right or wrong—how do these distinctions and attachments arise? It merely points to the word \"this\" as the root of the illness, urging people to see through it.\n\nBeyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss (the Dao encompasses heaven and earth, sharing the same body as the great void, originally without boundaries. Only because the multitude are deluded by the great Dao and cling to their own views as right do the debates of right and wrong arise. The sage’s mind merges with the Dao, so even beyond the six directions, they are not unaware; yet they preserve it without discussion, for it lies beyond the reach of ears and eyes, lest right and wrong arise). Within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not debate (within the six directions, the sage does not fail to comprehend all things, but only discusses their great principles—such as the heavenly constants and earthly duties—to establish the order of ruler and minister, father and child, without debating their details).\n\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* governs the world, embodying the intent of the former kings; the sage debates but does not argue (the *Spring and Autumn* serves as the great canon and law for governing the world’s rulers, ministers, fathers, and children. The sage merely debates the details of names and ranks without arguing the intricacies of right and wrong).\n\nThus, where there is division, there is also non-division (the Dao is one alone, originally undivided. Yet within the formed world of heaven and earth, the order of human relationships cannot but be divided. Though people and things are divided, the Dao is never divided—what is called \"nature is one alone\"). Where there is debate, there is also non-debate (though the world has countless debates, there are things that cannot be debated, for the great Dao of wordless understanding resides therein).\n\nWhy is this so? The sage embraces it (the sage is one with the Dao, clearly knowing the multiplicity of transformations yet never dividing them; clearly knowing the debates of many mouths, yet the Dao cannot be reached by words. Thus, they conceal their brilliance and hold it in their hearts without displaying it to others). The multitude debate it to display to one another (the multitude, in truth, have not grasped the origin of the great Dao, yet they feign knowledge, clinging to their own views as necessarily right, and with clamorous debates, boast to others—thus the great Dao is obscured).\n\nThus it is said: those who debate do not see (this quotes an ancient saying. Laozi said: \"The good do not debate; those who debate are not good\").\n\nThis passage explains that the sage who dissolves doubts is one with the Dao, reaching \"do not proceed thus, but rest here.\" It means the sage’s mind is like the great void: though they do not fail to know the affairs within and beyond the six directions, they embrace it without debate, revealing that those who love debate have not truly understood the great Dao. Below, the text further explains the meaning of non-speech and non-debate.\n\nThe great Dao cannot be named (the Dao originally has no name, so it cannot be designated). Great debate does not speak (the debate of non-speech makes right and wrong clear). Great benevolence is not benevolent (it is not a matter of deliberately being benevolent). Great integrity is not boastful (boastful means full. It does not take integrity as a source of pride). Great courage does not harm (harm means injury. Great courage arises from preserving the power of the Dao, not from injuring others).\n\nWhen the Dao is made manifest, it is no longer the Dao (when the great Dao is made evident, speech departs from it). When words debate, they do not reach it (the Dao is originally beyond words; even with verbal debates, they cannot attain it). Benevolence, when constant, does not succeed (if benevolence is constantly held with intent, it becomes partial love, thus failing to fully accomplish the ten thousand things). Integrity, when pure, is not trustworthy (trustworthy means real. To stand out with purity for the sake of reputation is to lack true virtue). Courage, when harmful, does not succeed (if courage harbors intent to harm others, it is mere blood and qi, not the courage of Dao and righteousness).\n\nThese five, though rounded, nearly verge on the square (though these five names may be practiced in the world, as they all arise from intent, they ultimately cannot be realized—thus they nearly verge on the square).\n\nThus, to know where to halt in what one does not know—this is perfection (the above five, though nearly square, cannot be practiced, for they stem from the fault of clinging to petty knowledge and self-interest, truly unaware of the origin of the great Dao. Hence, when the sage halts at the boundary of what he does not know, this is deemed perfection. This concludes the meaning of the preceding chapter, which traces back to the ancients and the limits of their knowledge).\n\nWho knows the eloquence of silence, the Dao that cannot be spoken? If one can know this, it is called the Heavenly Treasury (to say that the realm of the unknown is the origin of the great Dao—here, there is fundamentally no debate or discourse. If one knows this eloquence of silence, this Dao that cannot be spoken, it is like the pivot at the center of a wheel, responding endlessly. Thus, one who knows this is called the Heavenly Treasury).\n\nPour into it, yet it is never full (the body of the great Dao is empty; even the vast sea cannot compare to its capacity. Thus, the waters of heaven and earth arise within it, yet it is never filled); draw from it, yet it never runs dry (even if heaven and earth draw from it, it is never exhausted). Yet one does not know whence it comes (this is what is meant by \"empty yet inexhaustible, active yet ever-flowing, yet one does not know its source\")—this is called \"preserving the light\" (to preserve is to conceal without revealing. Earlier, it spoke of \"the radiance of doubt and confusion, which the sage takes as his model\"—here, it concludes by pointing to its meaning, saying this is called \"preserving the light\").\n\nEarlier, it spoke of \"the radiance of doubt and confusion, which the sage takes as his model,\" and thus presented matters within the six directions, both inner and outer. The sage knows all things but does not speak of them, for the great Dao is originally without knowledge or debate. The sage abides in the vast emptiness, roaming through the human world, harmonizing his light with the dust, shining yet not dazzling—this is called \"preserving the light.\" The sage’s work must reach this point to be complete, and thus it is said to be what the sage takes as his model.\n\nTherefore, long ago, Yao asked Shun: \"I wish to attack the states of Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao. Yet when I face south, I feel unsettled. What is the reason?\" (This \"unsettled\" means that in his heart, he was determined to attack them, yet afterward, he could not let it go, not knowing why.) Shun replied: \"Those three rulers dwell among the mugwort and reeds. Why should you feel unsettled? (This means Yao’s heart was not broad enough to embrace all things. Moreover, the three rulers occupied such humble positions, like mugwort and reeds, that they should not have troubled his heart. If you feel unsettled, why not expand yourself?) Long ago, when ten suns appeared together, all things were illuminated—how much more so for one whose virtue surpasses the sun? (This means Yao’s virtue had not yet reached its fullness. When ten suns appeared together, their light was vast and bright, illuminating all things—how much more so for one whose virtue surpasses the sun? If one’s virtue were already perfected, it would be vast and luminous, embracing all things—how could the insignificance of those three rulers trouble him?)\"\n\nThis illustrates that the sage who preserves the light has a heart as vast as the Heavenly Treasury—what the sage takes as his model is achieved only when his work reaches this point. If one’s work has not yet reached this level, the heart is not broad and cannot embrace all things. Thus, even the great sage Yao had his shortcomings. The image of ten suns appearing together serves as a metaphor for advancing virtue, summarizing the preceding meaning and concluding the intent from \"words are not like the wind\" onward.\n\nThe following passage reaffirms that the perfected one halts at what he does not know, revealing the sage’s accomplishment, and concludes with \"death and life do not alter him—how much less the beginnings of profit and harm?\"\n\nNie Que asked Wang Ni: \"Do you know what all things agree upon as right?\" He replied: \"How would I know?\" \"Do you know what you do not know?\" He replied: \"How would I know?\" \"Then do things have no knowledge?\" He replied: \"How would I know? Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it. How do I know that what I call knowing (this knowing is the knowledge of ordinary people) is not not-knowing? How do I know that what I call not-knowing (my not-knowing) is not knowing? (Does the sage’s knowing fundamentally differ from that of ordinary people? Yet ordinary people, habituated to delusive knowledge, cling to their own views as right—none of it is true knowledge.)\"\n\nMoreover, I once questioned you to illustrate that this is not true knowledge: When people sleep in damp places, they develop lumbar ailments and partial paralysis—yet does the loach fare so? When they dwell in trees, they tremble with fear—yet does the gibbon fare so? Among these three, which knows the proper dwelling? People eat the flesh of livestock, deer graze on grass, centipedes relish snakes, and owls feast on mice—among these four, which knows the true flavor? Gibbons mate with gibbons, deer couple with elk, and loaches swim with fish to conceive. Mao Qiang and Lady Li were beauties admired by all—yet fish seeing them plunged deep, birds seeing them soared high, and deer seeing them bolted away. Among these four, which knows the true beauty of the world?\n\nFrom my perspective, the origins of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and confused—how could I discern their distinctions? Nie Que said: \"If you do not know benefit and harm, does the perfected person likewise not know benefit and harm?\" Wang Ni replied: \"The perfected person is divine! Though great marshes burn, they cannot be scorched; though rivers and lakes freeze, they cannot be chilled; though thunder splits mountains and gales shake the seas, they cannot be startled. One who is thus rides the clouds and qi, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas. Death and life bring no change to them—how much less the beginnings of benefit and harm?\"\n\nThis passage elaborates on the earlier statement that \"the perfected person abides in what they do not know,\" showing how ordinary people mistake their partial knowledge for truth. With such judgments of right and wrong, how could I discern their distinctions? It concludes that the perfected person’s utmost unknowing transcends life and death—how could common understanding fathom this?\n\nBelow, it speaks of equalizing life and death, observing the world through the lens of dreams and waking to show that all under heaven are unawakened, and those who debate right and wrong are but dreaming within a dream. The prose is extraordinary, yet its meaning is perfectly sound.\n\nQuquezi asked Changwuzi: \"I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in worldly affairs, does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, and does not follow the Dao with intention. Without words, there are words; with words, there are no words. They roam beyond the dust and grime. The Master (Confucius) deemed these reckless words, but I consider them the practice of the wondrous Dao. What do you think?\" Changwuzi replied: \"Even the Yellow Emperor would be perplexed by your words—how could Qiu (Confucius) understand them? Moreover, you have judged too hastily. You see an egg and demand a rooster to crow at dawn; you see a slingshot and demand a roasted owl.\"\n\nThis is the metaphor of judging too hastily. I have spoken to you recklessly—speak of the virtue of the perfected person as I have—and you must listen recklessly in turn. How could it be otherwise? They embrace sun and moon, clasp the cosmos in their hands. Their lips align with all transformations, setting aside the muddled confusion of the world, treating all—from the Son of Heaven to the nobles, ministers, great officers, and scholars—as mere underlings vying for rank. The multitude toil endlessly, enslaved by their desires, while the sage remains as foolish and unformed as an un sprouted blade of grass. They merge with the ten thousand years into a single purity, for the sage, entering the realm beyond life and death, harbors no mind of right or wrong. All things are thus, yet people entangle themselves in this web of \"rightness.\" How do I know that delighting in life is not delusion? How do I know that hating death is not like a wanderer who, having lost their home in youth, does not know the way back?\n\nLady Li of Li was the daughter of the warden of Ai. When the state of Jin first took her, her tears soaked her collar. Yet once she reached the king’s palace, sharing his bed and feasting on fine meats, she later regretted her tears. How do I know that the dead do not regret their initial longing for life? If one knew the joy of death, might they not repent their former pursuit of life? This joy lies in being freed from the burdens of bodily existence—not the bliss of Buddhist extinction. From the Buddhist perspective, it is like one who, through cultivation, escapes the suffering of desire-realm rebirth and attains the joy of the first dhyāna heaven. It is not that worldly people take death itself as joy. The reader must discern its true meaning.\n\nOne who dreams of drinking wine wakes to weep; one who dreams of weeping wakes to hunt. This speaks of viewing the human world as a dream, and life and death as night and dawn. To wander thus through the world—this is the very conduct of men. The reversal of dream and waking arises from not yet awakening to the great dream, and thus taking life and death as cause for sorrow or joy. If one knew that dream and waking are one, then life and death would be a single thread.\n\nWhen one is dreaming, one does not know it is a dream. Within the dream, one may even interpret that dream. This is to say, the world lies wholly in delusion, yet remains unaware of its delusion—just as in a dream one does not know it is a dream. And men of the world take themselves to be wise and correct, debating with others. This is like interpreting a dream within a dream, yet truly not knowing one remains in delusion.\n\nOnly with a great awakening does one know this was the great dream. Yet fools take themselves for the awakened, smug in their supposed knowledge. These are the world’s fools—those who cling to debates over right and wrong, unaware they are still in delusion, yet priding themselves on their wisdom and flaunting it before others. This is the universal malady of ignorance across all ages.\n\nYou rulers! You shepherds! How rigid you are! And you, Qiu! You and you, Lady Changwu, are all dreaming. When I say you are dreaming, I too am but dreaming my words. Such speech is called *diào-guǐ*—\"arriving at the strange.\" *Diào* means \"to reach,\" *guǐ* means \"bizarre.\" This dream-speech is the most uncanny of discourses, and those dreaming cannot grasp its truth.\n\nEven after ten thousand generations, should a great sage arise who understands this truth, it would be as if we had met in the space of a single dawn and dusk. (This means: one must wait until ten thousand generations later for a fully awakened sage to recognize my words—yet for me, encountering such a one would be no different from meeting in the fleeting span of morning and evening. This old man’s heart has long known of the Buddha, certain that later ages would inevitably confirm his words. If not, then who else could be called \"the Great Awakened One\"?)\n\nThis passage clarifies how the perfected person transcends life and death to wander among the world: by seeing the world as a great dream, death and life as night and day, sorrow and joy as dream-events. Within delusion, debating right and wrong is like interpreting dreams in a dream; within delusion, what is taken for right and wrong is like recounting dream-events in broad daylight. In sum, all remains within the great dream. Without the perfected person’s insight, who would recognize this as the great dream? Fools secretly take themselves for the awakened—how shallow they are! Even the ancient sage-kings from Yao and Shun onward, along with their ministers, and Confucius himself, were but dreamers speaking in dreams. Zhuangzi declared that his own words, too, were spoken within a dream, with none to bear witness...\n\n[2 pages missing]\n\n\"Even if you and I were to debate, and you defeated me, or I defeated you—would you truly be right and I truly wrong? Or would I be right and you wrong? Or might we both be right? Or both wrong? Neither you nor I can know. Then all people are bound by their obscurity—whom could we ask to judge? If we asked one who agrees with you, how could they judge fairly, already sharing your view? If we asked one who agrees with me, how could they judge fairly, already sharing my view? If we asked one who differs from both of us, how could they judge fairly, already differing from us? If we asked one who agrees with both of us, how could they judge fairly, already agreeing with us? Thus, neither you nor I nor anyone else can know—must we then wait for another?\"\n\n\"What does it mean to harmonize with the heavenly equilibrium?\"\n\"It means: 'Is it so? Is it not so? So or not so.' If 'so' is truly so, then its difference from 'not so' requires no debate; if 'so' is truly so, then 'so' differing from 'not so' likewise requires no debate. The mutual dependence of changing voices—whether they depend on each other or not—harmonize with the heavenly equilibrium, following the boundless flow to exhaust the years. Forgetting the years, forgetting right and wrong, one soars into the boundless, thus dwelling in the boundless.\"\n\n[2 pages missing]\n\n...to reveal how the words and voices of worldly people arise from the heavenly mechanism, differing only in whether one is attuned to it or forgets it, thus distinguishing the sage from the ordinary. Hence the opening with the three winds, intending to compare earthly winds to the heavenly wind. Yet people possess lesser and greater knowledge, each clinging to their own views as absolute. Thus, having spoken of earthly winds, he describes how the mechanisms of greater and lesser knowledge differ, failing to align with the heavenly mechanism like the sound of wind through earthly hollows. Why is this? Because people have lost the true heavenly master within, mistaking the flesh-and-blood body for the self.\n\nThus, those who cling to the view of self and engage in contentious debates over right and wrong do so due to the error of delusion. Therefore, what follows points directly to the true master, urging one first to awaken to one’s original reality; to awaken to this original reality, one must first cast aside the bodily form. Hence the mention of the \"hundred bones and nine orifices,\" guiding one to see through the bodily form and recognize the true master. If one awakens to the true master, then naturally every word spoken aligns with the Dao, all arising from the celestial truth—this is what is called the heavenly wind. The inconsistencies in today’s debates stem from the words of the calculating mind, thus clinging to right and wrong. Therefore, the opening of the discourse on right and wrong begins with the phrase, *\"Now, words are not the blowing [of wind]\"*—raising this to generate the many subsequent descriptions of right and wrong, all unfolding from the two characters \"not blowing.\" Yet while ordinary people remain deluded and unawakened, the sage, having already awakened, is not swayed by the right and wrong of the multitude. Thus, whatever is spoken is reflected in heaven and earth. From this phrase, *\"reflected in heaven,\"* the public case for awakening is established. Hence, what follows argues that right and wrong need not be forcibly unified; one need only rest in the celestial balance, and without effort, all will naturally align. Through layer upon layer of discussion, it reaches the conclusion that in the end, no one can truly settle right and wrong. Like all the world, past and present, it is but a dream within a dream—only the great awakened sage can set it right. Even if one cannot await the great awakened sage, one need only realize the true master within each person, and the judgments of things and distinctions of right and wrong will become clear. Upon this awakening, right and wrong clarify themselves. Then, whatever is spoken arises from the celestial truth, no different from the earthly wind. Thus, the conclusion is drawn with the phrase *\"responding with transforming sounds.\"*\n\nIf one has not yet fully awakened, then whatever is spoken should be reflected in heaven, and the work lies in resting in the celestial balance. Hence, the closing words: *\"harmonizing with the celestial boundary.\"* This is the vital pulse and fundamental intent of the entire discourse. Yet the waves of the text surge boundlessly, making its depths difficult to fathom. If one can grasp its central meaning, then from beginning to end, it is coherent, rigorously structured, and not a single word is superfluous. This is what is meant by the *\"divine transformations of literature, like spirits and ghosts.\"*\n\nThe following section concludes with form, shadow, and dream as metaphors to reveal the true work of cultivation. The shadow’s shadow (the shadow beyond the shadow) asks the shadow: *\"Before, you were walking, now you are still; before, you were sitting, now you are rising. Why do you lack constancy?\"* (meaning, why is there no fixed principle in your movements of walking, stopping, sitting, and rising). The shadow replies: *\"Is it because I depend on something to be this way? Does what I depend on also depend on something else to be this way? Do I depend on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada?\"* (meaning, what I depend on is form, like the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada—mere things. What do they know?) *\"How could I know why it is so? How could I know why it is not so?\"* (meaning, that borrowed form is like an insensate clod, no different from a snake’s scales or a cicada’s wings, having nothing to do with the true master—it simply follows the movement of the celestial mechanism. How could one know whether it is so or not? The implication is that those who study the Dao and practice the work of forgetting the self must first observe this body as a shadow, like a snake’s scales or a cicada’s wings, and the attachment to self will naturally dissolve.)\n\nIn the past, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering happily as a butterfly. He was so content that he forgot he was Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, sprawled as Zhou. But was it Zhou who dreamed he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming it was Zhou? Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. (This speaks of the difference between dream and waking, yet it is all Zhou. How could the butterfly be Zhou, or Zhou the butterfly? Here, there must be clarity—one must see through this to regard life and death as dream and waking, and all things as one, thus eliminating the debates over right and wrong.) This is called *\"the transformation of things\"* (the transformation of things means all things merge into one. As it is said, *\"Great transformation is called sageliness\"*—the ultimate in aligning things can only be achieved by the sage of great transformation. When the myriad things blend and transform into one, then all distinctions of self and other, right and wrong vanish, and the inconsistencies of judgments naturally align. The alignment of things concludes with the metaphor of a dream, shattering the great dream of all the world, past and present. From this, we see that Zhuangzi’s learning is not easily attained—it is not merely about the text.)\n\nThis concludes the ultimate transformation in the alignment of things, thus presenting the indistinction of dream and waking, with the transformation of things as the highest principle. The general intent of this discourse is that to align things, one must first break the attachment to self as the foremost task. Hence, it begins with *\"I have lost my self.\"* Here, *\"I\"* refers to the true master, while *\"self\"* is the bodily form. Initially, it speaks of forgetting the self, not yet addressing the work; next, the work of forgetting the self requires observing that the bodily form is illusory, seeing through the hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera one by one, scattering them all—within them, who is truly the self? Only then is the true lord revealed. The implication is that if one awakens to the true lord, then the bodily form can be transcended; with the bodily form transcended, the self is naturally forgotten...\n\n[2 pages missing]\n\n**Chapter Three: The Preservation of Life**\n\nMy life has limits, but knowledge is without limit. To pursue the limitless with the limited is perilous! And to do so while already knowing this is perilous indeed! In doing good, avoid seeking fame; in doing evil, avoid approaching punishment. Follow the central path as your guiding principle—this can preserve the body, complete life, nourish one’s kin, and fulfill one’s years.\n\nButcher Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui. Where his hand touched, where his shoulder leaned, where his foot pressed, where his knee braced—*hua!*—the blade sang, *huo!*—each stroke struck true to rhythm, harmonizing with the dance of *Sanglin* and the cadence of *Jingshou*. Never was there haste or strain, only the effortless grace of a master.\n\nLord Wenhui exclaimed, “Ah! How marvelous! How has your skill reached such perfection?”\n\nButcher Ding laid down his knife and replied, “What your servant pursues is the Dao, which transcends mere technique. When I first began carving oxen, all I saw was the whole ox. After three years, I no longer saw the ox as a whole—for by then, I perceived its natural divisions: the head, horns, hooves, and flanks without; the five viscera, hundred bones, sinews, and joints within. Each part had its own principle, its own order, its own unforced pattern. Thus, I came to see that there was no ‘whole ox’ at all. Now, I encounter the ox with my spirit rather than my eyes. My senses stand still while my spirit moves, guided by the natural grain. My hand follows where it will, and the blade finds its way through the seams.”\n\nFollowing the natural grain—guided by the inherent patterns of flesh and bone—he cleaved the great seams and guided the blade through the great cavities, all by yielding to what was already so. Never once did his edge touch the knots where sinew binds to bone, much less the great bones themselves. For when the knife moves by principle, even the smallest junctures yield without resistance, let alone the massive bones that might obstruct.\n\nA skilled butcher wears out a knife each year, for he cuts by force. An ordinary butcher wears out a knife each month, for he hacks and chops. Yet my blade has served nineteen years, carving thousands of oxen, and its edge remains as keen as if newly whetted. For the joints have spaces, and the blade has no thickness. When what has no thickness enters where there is space, how ample the room for the blade to move! Thus, after nineteen years, my knife is still as if freshly honed.\n\nYet whenever I come to a tangled knot of sinew and bone, I see the difficulty. I grow wary, my gaze fixes, my movements slow. The blade moves with the slightest motion, and suddenly—*hua!*—the knot falls apart like clods of earth crumbling to the ground. Then I stand with knife in hand, look around in satisfaction, linger a moment to savor the achievement, wipe the blade clean, and put it away.”\n\nDuke Wenhui exclaimed, “Excellent! From Butcher Ding’s words, I have learned how to nurture life.”\n\nThis \"Nurturing the Life-Principle\" chapter establishes its meaning through the single episode of Butcher Ding’s dissection of an ox, which fully embodies the subtleties of nurturing life—nothing more than a grand metaphor. If one aligns each element precisely, its marvel becomes evident.\n\nButcher Ding represents the sage; the ox, the affairs of the world. From the vastness of the realm and the state to the minutiae of daily conduct, all are matters before one’s eyes. The skill of dissecting the ox is the art and wisdom of governing the realm, the state, and engaging with the world. The knife symbolizes one’s original nature, the master of life—acting in accord with one’s nature is like using the knife to dissect the ox.\n\nIt speaks of the sage who studies the Dao, awakening subtly to the truth of nature, then extending its threads to govern the realm and state, just as Butcher Ding first learned the Dao before applying it to his craft. Before awakening, one sees only conflict with the world, difficult to navigate—like Butcher Ding, who at first saw nothing but the whole ox. Yet as one deepens in the Dao and the wisdom of nature grows clearer, the affairs of the world are seen through, each possessing its own inherent, natural principle. Thus, no single matter appears before one as an obstacle, and \"the eye no longer sees the whole ox.\"\n\nHaving seen through worldly affairs, one acts solely in accord with Heaven’s principle, finding no difficulty whatsoever—this is what is meant by \"never encountering the knots of sinew and bone.\" By proceeding in harmony with principle, one avoids the exhausting pursuit of gain that harms the truth of one’s nature. Thus, like the knife’s edge after nineteen years, it remains as if newly whetted, entirely free from the slightest nick or flaw.\n\nWith the sage’s clarity and discerning wisdom applied to matters that accord with principle, even small tasks are met with vast capacity—like the blade gliding through ample space. If one encounters difficult, unprincipled matters, like tangled knots of sinew and bone, one need only proceed with caution, deliberating carefully, and they too will be easily resolved, their difficulty no longer apparent.\n\nHow could one so attuned to the world be wearied and worn, inviting harm to life and nature? Thus, the chapter concludes: \"From Butcher Ding’s words, I have learned how to nurture life.\" The intent lies in the sage’s alignment with nature, acting without excess, thereby preserving one’s nature and sparing the body from harm. One must deeply grasp this meaning, transcending the words themselves.\n\nSuch metaphors are found only in Buddhist sutras; they are utterly absent from secular texts, making them all the more worthy of careful reflection, for they contain profound significance.\n\nThe following passage speaks of those who fail to nurture life:\n\nGongwen Xuan, upon seeing the Chamberlain Right (an official title, referring to a one-legged man), exclaimed in shock, “What manner of man is this? How did he lose his foot? Was it Heaven’s doing, or man’s?” He replied, “It was Heaven, not man. Heaven gave him life to stand alone (meaning the Chamberlain Right was born with desires that corrupted his Heaven-endowed nature, thus incurring the punishment of amputation—Heaven’s penalty, leaving him solitary). Man’s form is bestowed by Heaven. Knowing this, one sees that his loss of a foot was Heaven’s doing, not man’s.”\n\nA marsh pheasant takes ten steps to peck, a hundred steps to drink, yet does not seek to be caged. Though its spirit may thrive, it finds no goodness in such confinement (the pheasant, though its sustenance is hard-won, willingly follows its nature and refuses to be kept in a pen. Though the pen’s provisions may nourish its spirit, it knows the suffering of constraint and finds no comfort in it, thus rejecting it. The Chamberlain Right, greedy and heedless of his form, was far inferior to the marsh pheasant. Thus, his amputation was truly Heaven’s punishment, though he remained unaware).\n\nThis passage speaks of those who fail to nurture life: they lose sight of their true nature, forget their form in pursuit of gain, and bring harm to life and spirit upon themselves, far less attuned than the marsh pheasant.\n\nNext, it speaks of even sages who, if they cannot forget emotion, also lose their Heaven-endowed nature. Thus, it invokes Laozi to illustrate:\n\nWhen Lao Dan died, Qin Shi came to offer condolences. He wailed three times and departed (showing no deep grief). His disciples asked, “Was he not your friend?” “Indeed,” he replied. “Then is it proper to offer condolences in such a manner?” they asked. “Yes,” he said. “At first, I thought him a true person (meaning when I first befriended him, I believed him to be one who had attained the Dao), but now I see he was not (after his death, I realized he had not). When I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping for him as if for their own children, and the young weeping as if for their mothers. Those who gathered to mourn must have shared unspoken bonds with him, their hearts unable to restrain themselves—thus their grief, though unsummoned, was so profound. This is fleeing from Heaven and doubling back on emotion, forgetting what one has received. The ancients called this ‘the punishment of fleeing from Heaven’ (punishment here means principle). Lao Dan, in his conduct, could not forget emotion while in the world, thus forming attachments to others, who in turn could not forget him.”\n\nThis is truly self-fleeing from Heavenly truth, forgetting one’s original endowment. The ancients called this ‘fleeing and losing Heavenly truth, injuring one’s nature’—such a one is no sage.\n\nAs for coming, Master, it was timely (to come into being is to follow the time); as for going, Master, it was in accord (to depart in death is the transformation of creation. Yet the Heavenly truth remains serene, never having known coming or going, life or death). Abiding by the time and dwelling in accord, sorrow and joy cannot enter (to live is to rest in one’s time; to die is to follow transformation—how then could death bring sorrow or life bring joy? For one who grasps the fundamental absence of life and death). The ancients called this ‘the Great Clod’s suspended release’ (the Great Clod is the lord of life. Nature is bound to form, like a man hung upside down. Now, transcending and following transformation, one releases nature from its suspension).\n\nThe point exhausts itself in being firewood, yet the fire is transmitted—one knows not its end (though form transforms, nature endures, like firewood consumed yet fire remaining. There is luminous mutuality, like firewood and fire passing on. Thus life is ceaselessly generated, transformation is without end. Like the transmission of firewood and fire, one knows not its exhaustion). This speaks of nature receiving its nourishment, so that Heavenly truth is preserved whole—then coming and going, life and death, are utterly without constraint. Thus the perfected one wanders in the world: though his form is the same as others’, his nature transcends things beyond, unaltered by the changes of life and death. This is truly due to having attained its proper nourishment. To nourish nature and restore truth is to be a true person.\n\nThus, in \"Among the World of Men,\" it speaks of the true person wandering without intent, using the analogy of Cook Ding carving an ox to show the effect of nourishing life’s master. Though the chapters differ, their meaning is fundamentally connected.\n\n\"Among the World of Men\"\nThis chapter expounds the Dao of the sage in the world. Yet \"Nourishing Life’s Master\" teaches not to harm life with worldly affairs, and the effort of nourishing life is gained through experiencing the world. If one can truly nourish oneself, then in engaging the world, one will naturally avoid the faults of flaunting talent, seeking fame, or forcing action without cause. In assisting a ruler or serving a command, one will avoid the suspicion of boasting of merit or exaggerating virtue. And this effort—through fasting of the mind, sitting in forgetfulness, and engaging the world with emptiness—can be free from harm.\n\nIt speaks at length of the difficulty of worldly affairs and human feelings: unless one is empty and awaits things, even a slight talent or desire for fame will inevitably lead to harm. Thus the chapter concludes that \"lack of talent\" is the ultimate principle. Only when one engages the world without harm does the mastery of nourishing life become evident, mutually illuminating the previous chapter.\n\nConfucius was a sage who served the world, and Yan Hui was the foremost disciple of the sagely gate—thus they are invoked to lend weight, making the teaching credible.\n\nYan Hui sought an audience with Zhongni and asked to depart.\n“Where are you going?” (Zhongni asked where he intended to go.)\n“I am going to Wei.”\n“What for?” (The implication being that even a humane person like Yan Hui should not force action without cause.)\n“I have heard,” said Yan Hui, “that the Lord of Wei (Kuaikui) is in his prime (in the vigor of his years), and his conduct is solitary (he is harsh, self-willed, rejects remonstrance, and acts recklessly). He treats his state lightly and does not see his faults (he is heedless and dismissive of his state, unaware of his errors). He treats the deaths of his people lightly (he is indifferent to the people, so the dead are many), and the dead are measured by the state as if a marsh, like reeds (the dead are heaped like reeds in a marsh when the state is compared to a marsh)—the people have nowhere to turn (the people are distressed, with nowhere to appeal).\n\nI once heard you say, Master: ‘Leave a well-ordered state (if a state is well-governed, do not seek office without merit); go to a disordered state (to quell disorder and support the endangered is to bring peace to the people). The gate of a physician has many sick’ (those who are good at saving their time are like a good physician whose gate has many sick people). I wish to apply what I have heard and consider its principles (Yan Hui had long heard the Master’s words, so he wished to apply what he had heard and consider its methods), hoping that the state might be cured (hoping to relieve the people of their suffering).”\n\nZhongni said, “Alas! You will likely go and suffer punishment! The Dao does not desire mixture (to study the Dao, one must focus the mind single-mindedly; one cannot allow the mind to be disordered). Mixture leads to multiplicity, multiplicity to disturbance, disturbance to sorrow, and sorrow cannot be saved (if the mind is cluttered, one disturbs oneself with many affairs; disturbance leads to sorrow, and sorrow cannot be remedied).\n\nThe utmost person of old first established it in himself before establishing it in others (the utmost person of old, in engaging the world, first established the Dao and virtue in himself, then applied what he had established to others. These two lines are the great principle of engaging the world—none but the Master could attain this). If what is established in oneself is not settled, how can one have leisure to reach the conduct of violent men? Moreover, do you know where virtue is scattered and whence knowledge emerges? Virtue is scattered by fame, and knowledge emerges from contention (virtue cannot be preserved because of fame’s scattering; when fame scatters, substance is diminished. Knowledge that is revealed externally provokes the beginning of contention).”\n\nNames are mechanisms of mutual grinding (the sound of a machine’s grinding—names are what people use to jostle one another, none able to claim sole possession). Knowledge is the tool of contention (once talent or knowledge is revealed, everyone envies it, leading to strife and unrest). These two are instruments of misfortune, not to be fully deployed (talent and virtue, knowledge and skill—these are the seeds of calamity, instruments of harm; how can they be put into full practice?).\n\nMoreover, when virtue is deep and trust is firm (solid and unshakable), it may not yet align with another’s qi (if I apply deep virtue and steadfast trust to others, I must first gauge whether their qi harmonizes with mine). When fame is known but not contested, it may not yet reach another’s heart (though I do not contend for fame, I have not yet penetrated the other’s mind to know whether they trust me). To forcibly display before violent men the language of benevolence, righteousness, and the carpenter’s inked line—this is to make others resent what they perceive as one’s own beauty, and it is called \"bringing harm to others.\" One who harms others will inevitably be harmed in return. You risk becoming a harmer of others (though you act with firm trust and humble yourself before them, you have not yet discerned their qi or reached their heart, yet you press upon them the language of benevolence, righteousness, and the carpenter’s line. You may suddenly arouse suspicion and disbelief, leading them to think you are exposing their faults to highlight your own virtue. This is what it means to lack trust and thus invite slander. Such is called bringing harm to others. All who harm others will be harmed in return. If you do not carefully assess them before acting, you will likely be harmed by them).\n\nFurthermore, if a ruler truly delights in the worthy and despises the unworthy, what need has he for you to seek distinction (if the Lord of Wei genuinely values worthiness and rejects unworthiness, his state already has worthy men—why must you go forth to display your difference)? If you go unbidden (if you insist on going without being summoned), the lords will surely exploit their power to vie for victory (if you go without a royal summons, those lords will use their authority to compete with you, refusing your counsel). Your eyes will be dazzled (faced with the lord’s imposing power, you will lose your composure, your gaze bewildered), your complexion will flatten (once your eyes are dazzled, you will seek to recover, your expression smoothing into appeasement), your mouth will babble (with your demeanor already lost, your words will stammer in self-defense), your bearing will conform (once your appearance and words falter, your whole body will unconsciously yield and adapt), and your heart will complete it (with your outward demeanor lost, your inner resolve will abandon itself, reinforcing their faults). This is like using fire to fight fire, water to fight water—it is called \"increasing the excess\" (your initial intent was to correct their faults, yet you end up reinforcing them, like using fire or water to combat fire or water, only multiplying the harm). To follow the beginning without end (if you begin by yielding, their faults will know no limit)—you risk, by offering unsolicited earnest words, meeting your death before violent men (if they do not trust you yet you press deep counsel upon them, speaking profoundly where the relationship is shallow, they will grow suspicious and turn your words into slander. Thus, you will surely perish).”\n\nThis passage speaks of the greatest matters in navigating the world, with admonishing a ruler as foremost. If the sovereign has long distrusted you yet you abruptly press loyal counsel upon them, not only will they refuse to heed it, but you may bring about your own execution. Who but the great sage Confucius, profoundly versed in worldly affairs and wise in preserving himself, could grasp this? Even Yan Hui had not yet attained such understanding. This is the foremost concern in human affairs, hence it is addressed first.\n\n“Moreover, in ancient times, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan—both had cultivated their virtue, humbling themselves to soothe the people and opposing their superiors. (Guan Longfeng and Bigan established their reputations through loyalty, yet were ultimately killed. As ministers, they bent their bodies to comfort the ruler’s people. *Yufu* means to bow and console the people, displaying a demeanor of compassion. When the ruler failed to cherish the people, the ministers instead took it upon themselves to do so, seeking renown by contradicting the sovereign’s will. This provoked their wrath and brought about their deaths—was this not a path to death through the pursuit of fame?) Thus, their rulers used their cultivation to cast them out. They were seekers of fame. (These two sought fame through self-cultivation, opposing their rulers, so their rulers used their very cultivation to harm them—this was the fault of their pursuit of fame.)\n\nIn former times, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xu’ao, and Yu attacked Youhu. Their states were left desolate, their rulers turned into vengeful ghosts, and their own bodies suffered execution. Their campaigns did not cease, their pursuit of substance knew no end. (These two sages believed themselves to be acting with benevolence, eliminating tyranny and saving the people. Their quest for the substance of benevolence was unending, hence their ceaseless warfare. This, too, was the pursuit of fame, only multiplying the slaughter.) They were all seekers of fame and substance. (They sought the reputation of benevolence while waging war—achieving fame but losing its substance.) Have you alone not heard of this?\n\nFame and substance are things even sages cannot fully master. How much less can you? (Even the two sages could not fully attain or preserve both fame and substance—how could you?)”\n\nThis is to say that if Yan Hui recklessly acts without cause, seeking the substance of fame, he will surely fail to preserve himself, demonstrating the inevitability of punishment. Moreover, even sages cannot fully master fame and substance—how much less can ordinary people?\n\nThe above passage teaches Yan Hui that he must not go. Below, Confucius further asks about the way to proceed if he must.\n\n“Nevertheless, if you must have a method, tell it to me.” (Confucius said: Though I have explained why you must not go, if the situation compels you, what means will you use? Tell me, and let us see.)\n\nYan Hui replied: “If I maintain integrity while remaining empty, and strive with singleness of purpose, would that suffice?” (Hui said: I have no other method. I would only uphold strict conduct, empty my heart of thoughts of success or failure, and focus my will without regard for gain or loss. Would this suffice?)\n\nConfucius said: “How detestable!”\n\n\"How detestable indeed! For one whose yang qi is already overflowing and ostentatious, whose countenance shifts unpredictably—such a disposition even ordinary attendants dare not defy, let alone one like you, who has yet to speak with him. If you attempt to influence him by appealing to what moves him, he will only press back to indulge his own satisfaction. This is called failing to cultivate even the gradual accumulation of virtue—how much less can great virtue be achieved! He will cling rigidly to his ways without transformation, outwardly compliant yet inwardly unyielding. How could this possibly succeed?\"\n\nThis passage speaks of those stubborn and defiant men who reject counsel—even if one serves them with utmost loyalty and reverence, it only serves to inflate their arrogance, contributing nothing to their virtue, and ultimately proves futile.\n\n\"Then let me be inwardly upright yet outwardly yielding, achieving success by emulating the ancients.\" (Upon hearing the Master’s words, Yan Hui, realizing that sincerity and single-minded devotion could not prevail, reconsidered and proposed: \"If I maintain inner uprightness, adopt an outward demeanor of deference, and align myself with the ancients, employing these three methods, surely my endeavor will succeed.\")\n\n\"Inward uprightness means aligning oneself with Heaven.\" (Yan Hui explained the meaning of these three methods: \"To be inwardly upright and align with Heaven is to recognize that human nature is inherently upright, for this nature is endowed by Heaven. Since both he and I share this nature, I say: 'To align with Heaven is to know that both the Son of Heaven and I are children of Heaven. Why should I alone seek that others deem my words good or bad? If I act thus, people will call me a childlike innocent—this is what it means to align with Heaven.'\") (For since our nature is fundamentally the same, the ruler and I are both children of Heaven. I need only speak from my true nature, without concern for whether he deems my words good or bad. If I fully express this sincere and unfeigned heart, he will regard me as a child without guile—what harm could come of this?)\n\n\"Outward yielding means aligning oneself with others. Bowing, kneeling, and curving one’s body are the rites of a minister. If all others observe these rites, how dare I not do the same? To act as others do is to avoid their reproach—this is what it means to align with others.\" (Outward yielding means fully observing the rites of a minister without lapsing in propriety—what fault could there be in this?)\n\n\"To achieve success by emulating the ancients means aligning oneself with antiquity. Though my words may instruct, their substance is reproof, for such words existed in antiquity, not in me. If I act thus, though my words may be direct, they will not be deemed offensive—this is what it means to align with antiquity.\" (To achieve success means to cite established precedents; to emulate the ancients means to measure oneself against them. Thus, though my words may reprove and clarify right and wrong, they are grounded in truth, being the words of the ancients, not my own empty discourse. In this way, though my words may be direct, since they do not originate from me, they will not be taken as an affront.)\n\n\"Would this approach then be acceptable?\" (With these three methods, might success be within reach?)\n\nConfucius said, \"Alas! How could it be? Your methods are too numerous and lack stability.\" (He lamented its impossibility: \"Your principles are too many and lack steadiness.\") (Here, *zhengfa* means \"principles\" or \"standards,\" while *die* means \"stable\" or \"secure.\" To employ these three methods is to rely on too many standards, and thus they remain unsteady.) \"Though you may hold firm, you will still be without fault.\"\n\nThough this may suffice, it is no more than this—how could it ever bring about transformation? It remains but the way of one who follows their own mind. (To say that these three methods, though not blameworthy, are no more than this, and cannot transform the heart of another—why? Because all three proceed from intention, failing to forget the self. And if one has not yet perfected oneself, how can one transform another?)\n\nThis passage speaks of the three methods, which derive from Confucius’ teaching that the noble person has three reverences: to walk with Heaven is to revere Heaven; to walk with others is to revere the great person; to walk with the ancients is to revere the words of the sages. Yet the discussion here is seamless, leaving no trace—these three matters do not reach the boundless transformation of the sage, but remain within the common ways of the world. The meaning lies beyond the words.\n\nYan Hui said, “I have no further progress to make. (My learning has reached this point and no more.) May I ask for your guidance?” (I beg to learn the method by which I may follow your teaching.)\n\nConfucius said, “Fast, and I will tell you.” (You must fast your heart in order to receive my teaching.) “If you act with intention, will it be easy? (If you act with a mind still untransformed, seeking to transform others, how could it be easy?) Those who deem it easy are not in accord with the vast Heaven.”\n\nYan Hui said, “My family is poor, and for months I have drunk no wine and eaten no meat. Might this be considered fasting?” (Here, Yanzi does not yet understand fasting of the heart.)\n\nConfucius said, “This is the fasting of sacrifice, not the fasting of the heart.”\n\nYan Hui said, “May I ask what fasting of the heart is?”\n\nConfucius said, “Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the heart. Do not listen with the heart but listen with qi. Listening ends in resonance. (This means the heart merges with principle.) Qi is that which is empty and awaits things. Only the Dao abides in emptiness. (Emptiness is the essence of the Dao.) Emptiness is the fasting of the heart.” (He teaches Yanzi that the fasting of the heart consists in dwelling in emptiness.)\n\nYanzi’s many methods had not yet departed from intention; all words proceeding from intention fail to forget contrivance. As long as contrivance is not forgotten, the self is not transformed. Thus, he is taught the fasting of the heart, taking emptiness as its ultimate state. In emptiness, self and other are both forgotten, the self is transformed, and things transform of themselves.\n\nYan Hui said, “Before I received this teaching, I indeed took myself to be Yan Hui. (Before instruction, I still clung to the notion of a self.) Now that I have received it, I no longer have a self—may this be called emptiness?” (Upon hearing the teaching of the fasting of the heart, he suddenly forgot himself—can this forgetting of self be called emptiness? Yan Hui’s sudden awakening upon a single word was thus.)\n\nThe Master said, “It is complete! (The principle of the fasting of the heart is fully realized here.) I will now tell you: (You are now ready to receive teaching.) If you can enter and wander within the world’s snares (the snares being the fences of the worldly net) without being moved by reputation (if you can move through the world, emptying yourself and forgetting all concerns, without using cunning to impress others and seek fame), then speak when there is resonance, and cease when there is none. (Do not cling to a fixed intention, but observe the other’s spirit and qi. If there is resonance, speak; if not, desist—do not force it.) Have no gate, no drastic remedy. (A gate means establishing a fixed doctrine. A drastic remedy is like a medicine that must cure—both are harmful and should not be used.) Dwell in unity and lodge in the unavoidable—then you will be near it. (Dwell in a single mind, free of duality. Respond to what is said, lodging your intent in the unavoidable, never acting with deliberate effort. Only then will you be near.)”\n\n\"To vanish without a trace is easy; to walk the earth without leaving a mark is difficult. (To escape others and withdraw from the world is still relatively easy when one remains alone; to engage with the world without intent, leaving no trace of form or action, is far harder—just as Laozi said, 'The skilled traveler leaves no tracks.') To be employed by men is easy to feign; to be employed by Heaven is difficult to feign. (When the sage responds to the world, it is as Heaven’s emissary. If one were merely an emissary of men, pretense might suffice. But the sage rides the true heart in governing things—how could pretense ever serve?)\n\nWe have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings. (This is a metaphor for acting with intent versus without. People may succeed in affairs when they act with intent, but to respond to things without intent, moving others as if flying without wings—this is unheard of.) We have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge. (People all know through having knowledge. The sage knows without knowledge, for he forgets form and transcends intellect, responding to things with a heart devoid of intent. This is the difficulty—something unheard of.)\n\nBehold that empty space: in a vacant room, brightness arises. (This is a metaphor for the emptiness of the heart. When a room is empty, even a small opening allows light to enter, and brightness fills the vacant space. Likewise, when the heart is empty, the light of Heaven naturally shines forth.) Auspiciousness comes to rest where it rests. (When one acts with intent, fortune and misfortune follow—so-called good and ill fortune, regret and shame, all arise from action. But if the heart is empty of things, not a single thought arises, and clarity shines of itself. Regret and shame vanish entirely, and only auspiciousness comes to rest. This empty heart is where auspiciousness abides.)\n\nYet if one does not rest here, this is called 'sitting while galloping.' (The human heart is originally empty and bright, but if one does not settle the mind here, private desires arise, and though the body sits still, the heart races elsewhere—this is 'sitting while galloping.') If one loses the pursuit of the ears and eyes, turning inward to unify them, and goes beyond the heart’s knowledge, then spirits and gods will come to dwell—how much more so men! (To lose the pursuit of the ears and eyes means to return to true seeing and hearing, hence 'turning inward to unify.' If this inward unity merges with the heart’s essence, the true light shines forth, and one no longer relies on deluded thoughts or false knowledge. Then, in emptiness and clarity, stillness and illumination, one’s virtue aligns with spirits and gods, and they will come to dwell—how much more will men be moved! This is flying without wings. This is the utmost teaching of return.)\n\nThis is the transformation of the ten thousand things. (To lose the ears and eyes is to forget form; to go beyond the heart’s knowledge is to extinguish intellect. When self and things are both forgotten, and the self forgets while things transform, then the ten thousand things all become the Dao.) It is the pivot of Yu and Shun, the lifelong practice of Fuxi and Jiqu, and how much more so for those of scattered minds! (When self and things are both forgotten and the ten thousand things all transform, this is returning to the origin of the great Dao. Even the divine sage Yu held it as his pivot, and the great sages Fuxi and Jiqu governed the world by it throughout their lives—how much more should ordinary people do so! Yan Hui could apply this in the world—what forced action would there be?)\n\nThis speaks of engaging with the world, first in serving one’s lord. This speaks of the difficulty of assisting a lord. If one does not forget both self and things, govern with an empty heart, and respond only to what cannot be avoided, one will never move the lord or avoid disaster. If one stubbornly clings to one’s own views, holds fast to unyielding intentions, and forces remonstrance, not only will it fail to benefit the lord, but it will bring about the calamity of death. This was the error that led to the deaths of Longfeng and Bigan.\n\nBelow, the difficulty of missions is discussed. When Viscount Zigao of She (Zigao was the courtesy name of Liang, a grandee of Chu) was about to be sent on a mission to Qi, he asked Confucius: 'The king’s charge to me is most weighty (implying matters of war and conflict). The way Qi treats envoys is outwardly respectful but inwardly slow to act (though Qi’s lord appears reverent toward envoys, his heart is negligent and cannot address urgent matters). Even a common man cannot be lightly moved—how much less a feudal lord! (The affairs of Chu are urgent, yet if Qi is slow, one dare not press them. Even a common man cannot be lightly moved—how much less a feudal lord!) I am deeply fearful of this. (Fearing that I will fail in the state’s affairs and incur punishment, I am greatly afraid.)\n\nYou once told me: 'In all matters, great or small, few succeed without joyful accord. (I recall your teaching that in all affairs, whether great or small, success requires joyful accord. If Qi is not joyful, the matter will be difficult to accomplish—this is why I fear.) If the matter does not succeed, there will surely be human-caused calamity. (If the matter fails, will the lord not punish me? There will surely be human-caused calamity.) If it succeeds, there will surely be calamity from the imbalance of yin and yang. (If Qi is slow, one must labor in many ways, seeking success through compromise—then the strain of anxiety will bring illness, a calamity of yin and yang.) Only one with virtue can succeed or fail without calamity. (One with virtue refers to a sage of complete virtue. Only the sage, who responds to the world with an empty heart and does not treat things as affairs, can succeed or fail without calamity.')\n\nMy food is coarse and not refined (not indulging in rich flavors), and my kitchen has no one seeking coolness. (My food is simple and plain, with little cooking, so those tending the stove do not seek coolness to escape the heat.)\"\n\nThis morning I received my charge, and by evening I am drinking ice—does this mean I suffer from internal heat? (I have long eaten plain food, so I should have no internal heat. Yet now, upon receiving my charge in the morning, I drink ice by evening, for the fire syndrome has flared within—this comes from anxiety, sorrow, and overthinking stirring the fire. Is this not the illness of internal heat?) I have not yet grasped the true nature of the matter (its reality), yet already I suffer from the affliction of yin and yang imbalance (I have not even begun the task, yet already I am stricken with the disorder of yin and yang and the illness of internal heat). If the matter fails, there will surely be human-caused calamity (if the matter fails, will the lord not punish me? This is the human-caused calamity one cannot escape). Thus I face two perils. As a minister, I am not equal to this burden (these two perils weigh upon me, and the matter lies beyond my control—thus a minister cannot bear it). Pray, sir, instruct me in how to proceed (I wish you would teach me how to act).\"\n\nThis speaks of the difficulty of a minister’s mission. For a minister, if he concerns himself only with his own reputation and success, he will inevitably seek achievement and completion, his mind entangled with endless calculations, his spirit worn by anxiety and overthinking. Yet all ministers in the world face the difficulty of such missions, utterly unaware of how to conduct themselves, and thus cannot escape calamity. Therefore, the Master teaches the way to conduct oneself: there is a fixed mandate and a fixed principle; if one accepts and follows them with equanimity, one will naturally avoid calamity. But if one clings to the certainty of success, one cannot escape it.\n\nConfucius said: \"There are two great precepts in the world (great precepts refer to the world’s great principles and laws, the unalterable commands of ruler and parent): the first is mandate, the second is duty. A child’s love for a parent is mandate—it cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is nowhere he may go that is not his lord’s (Zhuangzi criticizes benevolence and duty, yet when it comes to a minister’s service to his lord, he takes duty as primary, even deeming death in loyalty unworthy. Here, he says that in a minister’s service to his lord, there is nowhere he may go that is not his lord’s—this is the height of loyalty. How could Laozi have transcended worldly concerns?). There is no escape from them in heaven and earth. These are called the great precepts (the commands of ruler and parent cannot be escaped—these are the world’s great, unchanging principles and laws).\n\nThus, one who serves a parent does not choose a place to find peace—this is the height of filial piety (a child serving a parent has nowhere to go that is not the parent’s command; thus he does not dare choose a place to find peace—this is the height of filial piety). One who serves a lord does not choose the matter to find peace—this is the height of loyalty (one who serves a lord obeys commands without hesitation, never allowing difficulty or ease to divide his heart—this is the height of loyalty. Thus the ancients felt shame at serving their lords with a divided heart). One who serves his own heart does not allow sorrow or joy to alter what lies before him (filial piety demands exhausting one’s strength; loyalty demands fulfilling one’s mandate. The essence is to devote heart and mandate fully, never allowing difficulty or ease to sway one’s resolve. This is the greatest service to the heart—never allowing sorrow or joy to enter it). Knowing that something is beyond one’s control yet accepting it as mandate—this is the height of virtue (a minister’s duty is to know that a matter may be beyond remedy yet never allow a divided heart to regard it. One must accept it as mandate. Accepting mandate means forgetting difficulty and ease—this is the height of virtue).\n\nAs a minister or child, one is bound by what one cannot avoid. One acts according to the true nature of the matter, forgetting oneself (a minister or child is bound by unavoidable duties; one must fulfill one’s mandate, forgetting oneself in the task). How could one have leisure to delight in life and fear death (a minister or child fulfills their mandate—how dare they consider life and death in their choices)? You may proceed thus (teaching Lord She, one should act in this way—it is sufficient).\"\n\nThroughout the *Zhuangzi*, loyalty and filial piety are deemed mere reputation, harmful to natural integrity and unworthy of esteem. Yet in the \"Human World\" chapter alone, he exhausts their true essence, not a word of which can be altered. Who would say he was ignorant of worldly affairs, giving free rein to his own will? And in invoking Confucius’ words, did he ever disrespect the sage? For in learning, there is a distinction between the inner and outer ways.\n\n\"In the outer way, one must esteem unboundedness as lofty, yet it is essential to return to the great Dao. As for the inner way, in matters of ruler-minister and father-child relationships, not a single concession can be made—this is because the great norms and great laws of the world must not be violated. This is what is meant by the Dao of the worldly and the transcendent, which encompasses all without exception and exhausts all principles. How could one view them with a single perspective?\n\n'Let me reiterate what I have heard (having broadly spoken of the righteousness of ruler-minister and father-child relationships, I shall now further discuss the principles of diplomatic missions): In dealings with neighboring states, one must align with trustworthiness (靡 means compliance; 信 means verification. In interactions with neighboring states, verification is indispensable, leaving no room for mere rhetoric). In dealings with distant states, one must be faithful in speech (when engaging with distant states, one must employ faithful rhetoric to harmonize the joy of both nations). Words must be conveyed through messengers (meaning words must be transmitted orally by envoys). Conveying words that bring double joy or double anger is the most difficult task under heaven (the stakes of such words determine safety or peril, and fortune or misfortune follows). When both parties are pleased, there will be an excess of flattery; when both are angered, there will be an excess of slander (the flaw lies in excess). All excess is delusion (excessive praise or slander arises from overreliance on cunning, thus losing its original truth—hence, it is delusion). Delusion cannot be trusted (since the words lack sincerity, the listener remains unmoved and disbelieving). If not trusted, the messenger incurs misfortune (once disbelief arises, the fault lies with the messenger, who will suffer the consequences). Thus, the standard teaching says: \"Transmit the constant sentiments, do not transmit excess words (constant sentiments are truthful and unadulterated). Then one may nearly preserve wholeness.\"'\n\nThis passage speaks of the difficulty of diplomatic missions, where the interests of both parties rest upon the envoy’s shoulders. If words exceed reality, they breed doubt and disbelief in the listener, becoming the root of disaster, and the messenger will inevitably bear the calamity. Thus, truthfulness and absence of delusion are prized, for they may nearly ensure preservation.\n\nThe following text elaborates: though one may provisionally preserve the matter at hand, in the end, great harm will surely follow. Words are not easily spoken—one must be cautious from the very beginning.\n\n'Moreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin with harmony but often end in conflict; when taken to extremes, they resort to excessive cunning (this speaks of the principle of caution at the outset and the end). Consider those who initially engage in playful contests of skill and strength: at first, both parties are in good spirits, but as the contest intensifies, a desire to prevail arises, and each employs their own cunning. Once cunning emerges, injury is inevitable; once injury occurs, the matter becomes earnest and irresolvable, culminating in anger. Here, *yang* signifies joy, and *yin* signifies anger.'\"\n\n\"Those who drink wine with propriety begin in order but often end in chaos; when taken to extremes, they indulge in excessive merriment. All affairs are likewise (consider those who drink wine: at first, host and guest observe proper decorum, but as the wine flows and joy intensifies, chaos inevitably follows. Not only in contests of skill or drinking, but in all matters), beginning in good faith but commonly concluding in deceit (good faith means accepting without discerning right or wrong. Deceit refers to treachery. For instance, in human relationships, one may at first share mutual sincerity and trust without doubt; over time, however, deceitful intentions arise).\n\nWhat begins simply will surely become vast by its end (not only in human relationships, but in all undertakings: one must begin with simplicity and frugality, yet by their conclusion, they inevitably grow vast, becoming uncontrollable. Such is the nature of circumstances). Words are like wind and waves; actions determine gain or loss (no affair can be assured from beginning to end, but words and actions are especially perilous. Words, like wind and waves, give rise to right and wrong; actions spring from reality itself. When actions are complete, reality is lost. Thus it is said: words and actions are the pivot of the noble person, the arbiter of honor and disgrace. What must be guarded, then, could it be taken lightly?).\n\nWind and waves are easily stirred; gain and loss easily endangered (wind and waves may capsize one, while gain and loss may bring ruin and disgrace. Knowing this, one knows what must be guarded). Thus, anger arises from no other source than cunning words and biased speech (all human anger is provoked by cunning words and biased speech). When a beast dies, it does not choose its cries; its breath comes forth in a sudden fury, and from this, malicious intent arises (茀 means sudden; 历 refers to ghostly affliction. When cunning words and biased speech provoke anger, the person’s qi erupts uncontrollably, lashing out without regard, like a dying beast that does not choose its cries. The listener, taking it as truth, will likewise develop an untreatable malice).\n\nWhen scrutiny becomes excessive, it will surely evoke an unworthy response, though one may not realize it (when a person, provoked by words, acts in anger, they will unjustly condemn the object of their wrath, scrutinizing even the slightest detail without leniency. If such scrutiny becomes extreme, the targeted person will inevitably respond with unworthy intentions. Thus, the calamity between the two is sealed, yet neither understands why. The cause lies in cunning words and biased speech). If one remains unaware of the cause, who can foresee the outcome? (If one recognizes the fault in cunning words, there may still be resolution. But if one does not understand their origin, the calamity between the two will have no end).\n\nThus, the maxim states: ‘Do not alter commands; do not urge completion’ (since cunning words and biased speech are the root of calamity and the ruin of affairs, envoys must not exceed their words—do not alter their orders, do not urge completion, to avoid future disaster). Excess transgresses the proper measure (all additions exceed the proper limit. Altering orders or urging completion will inevitably spoil matters; it must not be done).\n\nTrue excellence requires time; evil, once formed, cannot be undone—can one not be cautious? (All affairs should not be rushed to completion; thus, true excellence takes time. If one forces evil to form, it cannot be corrected. One must be cautious!). Moreover, to ride the world with a wandering mind, entrusting oneself to necessity to nurture the center—this is perfection (this teaches the proper way of fulfilling a mission. Only the perfected person, forgetting self and others, follows the natural course of things, wandering the mind among them. Affairs cannot be forced with intention; one must respond to necessity, nurturing the Way of centrality without losing one’s integrity. Such conduct in the world may be called perfection).\n\nWhat action can be repaid? Nothing surpasses fulfilling one’s mandate—this is the most difficult (this concludes the preceding discussion. What can an envoy do to fulfill their duty? Nothing surpasses fulfilling their mandate. Whether an affair succeeds or fails is determined by fate. Even now, as one serves as an envoy, there is a fixed mandate from one’s lord. Knowing that fate cannot be defied, one must accept it and follow its natural course, neither exceeding one’s words nor seeking success through luck. Knowing that the lord’s mandate cannot be defied, one must not alter orders or urge completion, to avoid future disaster. This is the meaning of fulfilling one’s mandate. Only the perfected person can achieve this; for ordinary people, it is not easy—thus, it is the most difficult).\"\n\nThis passage speaks of the difficulty of navigating the world, with nothing surpassing the challenge of fulfilling a mission. Lord Ye’s concerns were indeed justified. The Master’s words capture the essence of missions, the pivot of fortune and misfortune, and the utmost depth of human nature. The saying that \"a scholar offers his life in the face of danger\" could only come from the Master, a sage deeply versed in worldly affairs.\n\nWhen Yan He was about to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei (Kuaikui), he consulted Qu Boyu (whose given name was Yuan, a worthy man of Wei and a friend of Confucius), saying: \"There is a man here whose virtue is decreed by Heaven (read as *jiang*, meaning lowly, referring to one born of inferior nature). If I deal with him without rules, it will endanger our state; if I deal with him with rules, it will endanger myself (if I measure him with laws and admonish him, he will surely reject them and resent me, endangering myself).\"\n\n\"His knowledge (read as *zhi*) is just enough to perceive others' faults but not their causes (meaning he is clever enough to pick out others' mistakes but unaware of his own). In such a case, what should I do?\"\n\nQu Boyu replied: \"An excellent question indeed! Be vigilant, be cautious—this man cannot be lightly provoked. First rectify yourself! In appearance, do not oppose him (for his nature is fierce and perverse; do not resist him directly, but rather follow his virtues to later correct his vices). In heart, do not conflict with him (for one must not oppose him with ill intent; instead, harmonize with him). Yet even these two approaches have their dangers (though you follow in appearance and harmonize in heart, peril remains. If you follow in appearance, you risk becoming like him; if you harmonize in heart, you risk pleasing him. Indulging him thus, you dare not admonish, hence the danger). Do not fully immerse yourself in following (though you follow in appearance, do not wholly surrender), nor fully display your harmony (to display would be to show your strengths and expose his flaws, which is undesirable). If you follow in appearance and immerse yourself, you will bring ruin, destruction, collapse, and downfall (if you flatter and indulge his vices, you will only amplify them, inviting calamity of ruin, destruction, collapse, and downfall). If you harmonize in heart and display it, you will invite fame and reputation, mischief and disaster (if you reveal even a hint of your integrity, he will twist your virtues into infamy, and his resentment will breed mischief and disaster. Thus, both approaches harbor peril).\n\nIf he acts like a child, then act like a child with him (a child, meaning he lacks understanding). If he abandons all boundaries, then abandon boundaries with him (boundaries, meaning no walls or restraints). If he becomes boundless, then become boundless with him (boundless, meaning no limits, utterly unrestrained). Guide him gradually into flawlessness (first, in all actions, avoid the slightest opposition to his will. Once he trusts you completely and harbors no doubt, then subtly lead him through circumstances toward a state without fault. This is precisely what it means to follow his virtues while correcting his vices, thus avoiding peril).\"\n\nWould you not know the mantis? It raises its arms in fury to block the wheel tracks, unaware of its own incapacity (this illustrates resisting without measuring one’s strength. The mantis, in its rage, raises its arms against the chariot wheel—its resolve may seem admirable, yet it knows not that its strength is unequal to the task). Such is the beauty of its talent (the mantis relies on the beauty of its talent, yet fails to gauge its own power. Though its talent is fine, when one exhausts all strength in serving a violent ruler, disaster is scarcely avoidable).\n\nBeware, be cautious: if you accumulate and boast of your fine talents, then boldly confront the ruler’s peril, you will be like the mantis raising its arms—death will be all but certain. Can you not take heed?\n\nDo you not know the keeper of tigers? He dares not feed it living creatures, for fear of rousing its killing rage (if given living prey, it will nurture its predatory instincts). He dares not offer it whole carcasses, for fear of provoking its tearing fury (if presented with an intact body, the tiger will rend it, unleashing its wrath; once enraged, its ferocity becomes uncontrollable). He times its hunger and satiety, appeases its angry heart. Though tiger and man are of different kinds, the tiger fawns upon its keeper—this is compliance. Thus, what brings about its killing is defiance (to raise a tiger without complying with its nature is to invite certain slaughter).\n\nNow, the lover of horses uses a basket to collect their dung and a clamshell to gather their urine. Should a gadfly or horsefly alight upon the horse, and the master fails to brush it away at the right moment, the horse will snap its bit (enraged, it will break its bridle), smash its headstall, and shatter its breastplate (when angered, the horse will destroy the harness binding its chest and head). Love may be profound, yet a single misstep can undo it (though one may love the horse deeply, an ill-timed touch can trigger its rage, snapping the reins and shattering the bridle—what then remains of that love?). Can one not be cautious?\n\n(The analogy of the horse is especially apt. These three parables serve as grave warnings for those who serve violent rulers.) Such is the difficulty of aiding a ruler.\n\nThe three examples above all illustrate the perils of navigating the human world. They teach that those who traverse this realm must empty their hearts, accept fate, adapt to the times, and exercise constant vigilance—neither clinging to \"can\" nor \"cannot\"—only then may they avoid calamity. Those who cannot empty their hearts, who rely on cunning and act recklessly without cause, are like Yan Hui. Those who cannot accept fate, who torment themselves with endless worries, who hesitate when action is required, are like Lord Ye. Neither path aligns with the sage’s way of engaging the world; one must take Confucius’ words as the standard.\n\nIf one must, out of necessity, engage with the world and serve a ruler, one must follow their virtues, correct their vices, and exhaust one’s loyalty. Above all, one must proceed with caution and trepidation, discerning change and seizing the moment—never acting carelessly, never relying on talent to provoke recklessly, lest one court destruction. In this, one should heed the words of Qu Boyu.\n\nThe twists and turns of human affairs are fully expounded here. Only by esteeming Confucius and Boyu can one avoid disaster.\n\nThe above speaks of the burdens of talent. Below, the untalented preserve their lives.\n\nWhen Carpenter Shi traveled to Qi and reached Quyuan, he saw an oak that served as a village shrine. Its girth could shade an ox, its circumference measured a hundred spans when embraced; its height rivaled the mountains, its branches appearing only after seventy feet. A dozen of its side limbs were large enough to make boats. Onlookers thronged like a marketplace (people marveled at its size and beauty, gathering in crowds). Yet the master carpenter paid it no heed and walked on without pause (he ignored the tree and continued without stopping). His disciple, sated with the sight, ran to catch up and asked, “Since I took up the axe to follow you, master, I have never seen timber so magnificent. Why did you refuse to look and walk on without pause?”\n\n“Enough,” he replied. “Say no more!”\n\nThe tree is but a worthless timber. If made into a boat, it would sink; if made into a coffin, it would rot swiftly; if made into vessels, they would break quickly; if used for doors and gates, it would ooze sap (its hinges would drip with moisture); if used as pillars, it would be eaten by worms. It is a tree of no use. Precisely because it is good for nothing, it has attained such longevity.”\n\nCarpenter Shi returned home, and the oak of the village shrine appeared to him in a dream, saying, “With what would you compare me? Would you liken me to the fine timber? Those crabapples, pears, oranges, and pomelos—fruit-bearing trees—once their fruits ripen, they are stripped and humiliated. Their great branches are broken, their small branches are torn. This is how their usefulness brings suffering to their lives. Thus, they do not live out their natural span but perish midway, felled by the world’s demands. All things are like this. As for me, I have long sought to be of no use! I nearly died before attaining this (for ordinary people, unaware of my worthlessness, nearly felled me many times. Now, by fortune, I remain whole). This is my great usefulness (to preserve my life by being useless). Had I been of use, could I have grown so large? Moreover, you and I are both things—why then do you judge me so (you and I are but things in this world; why do you, relying on your usefulness, deem me useless)? And you, a man nearly dead yourself, how could you know the worth of a worthless tree?”\n\nCarpenter Shi awoke and recounted his dream to his disciples. One disciple asked, “If it sought to be useless, why then did it become a shrine? What is the reason?” He replied, “Hush! Say no more! It merely lodges there (it is only by chance that the shrine is placed upon this tree, for the tree itself has no desire to be a shrine). It is those who do not understand who revile and slander it (ordinary people, not grasping the meaning of this lodging, take the tree to be truly sacred and thus harm it with such a name). Were it not a shrine, would it not have been felled long ago? Moreover, what it preserves is different from the rest, yet people praise it for its righteousness (the tree preserves its natural lifespan by being useless, thus differing from others. Yet people, not understanding, praise it for its utility in benefiting others, restraining violence, and eliminating wrongdoing)—how far this is from the truth!”\n\nThis speaks of the oak shrine tree, which by being useless preserves its natural years, safeguards its life, and avoids harm—this is the great usefulness of being useless. In contrast, those who rely on talent, act recklessly, seek favor from rulers, and court fame only bring harm upon themselves—how vastly different they are from this tree! This is Zhuangzi’s intent in scorning the world and giving free rein to his will. Below, he expounds on the idea of preserving oneself by being useless, illustrating his own resolve. This is the purpose of his discourse.\n\nNanbo Ziqi wandered in the hills of Shang and saw a great tree unlike any other: it could shelter a thousand chariots, its shade enveloping all who rested beneath its branches. Ziqi said, “What tree is this? It must possess extraordinary timber!” Looking up at its slender branches, he saw they were gnarled and unfit for beams; looking down at its great roots, he saw they were split and unfit for coffins. Tasting its leaves, his mouth blistered and burned; smelling them, he was struck with a madness like drunkenness that lasted three days without end. Ziqi said, “This is truly a useless tree, and yet it has grown so vast! Alas, the spirit-like person—it is through such uselessness that they attain sageliness.”\n\nIn Song, there was a region called Jing where catalpa, cypress, and mulberry thrived. Those trees that could be grasped with one or two hands were felled for monkey perches; those three or four spans around were felled for grand and ornate beams; those seven or eight spans around were felled by wealthy households for coffin planks. Thus, they did not live out their natural years but were cut down midway by axes—this is the calamity of being useful. Therefore, when performing expiatory sacrifices, they used oxen with white foreheads (their color impure), pigs with upturned snouts (their form unsightly), and men with hemorrhoids—none of these could be offered to the river (as human sacrifices to the river, or as shamans; the *Han Shu* records that for the River Earl, they selected beautiful boys and girls and cast them into the river, calling it “offering to the river”). The shamans knew well that these were inauspicious (for even these, with the slightest flaw, were enough to preserve their lives).\n\nYet how much more so for the spirit-like person who preserves themselves through uselessness! This is precisely what makes the spirit-like person supremely auspicious. Here, the extreme safety of worthlessness is made clear, just as the extreme peril of talent and beauty is evident. Only the spirit-like person understands that talent is a calamity, and so they sever sagacity, cast off cunning, remain dull and muddled, and hold no regard for worldly affairs. This is how their uselessness allows them to preserve their body, nurture life, and live out their natural years. Such a warning to the world runs deep indeed.\n\nTake \"Broken Branches\" (a hypothetical name—\"broken\" meaning to efface one’s form, \"branches\" to obscure one’s intelligence, a metaphor for forgetting form and abandoning knowledge): his jowls sink into his navel, his shoulders rise above his crown, his topknot points to the sky (his back so hunched that his neck cranes upward), his five viscera’s transport points face upward (the back’s acupoints now above), and his thighs press against his ribs (his body so contorted that his legs flank his torso). Mending clothes with needles and washing laundry suffice to feed himself; winnowing grain and sifting chaff (tasks suited to his twisted form) suffice to feed ten men (his crooked frame lends strength to winnowing, earning him enough to sustain ten). When conscription is called, Broken Branches waves his arms among the crowd (his deformity spares him fear of selection); when great labor is demanded, he is excused for chronic illness; when grain is doled out to the sick, he receives three bushels and ten bundles of firewood. If one so broken in form can still nourish his body and live out his years, how much more so one broken in virtue! This speaks of how deformity preserves life and averts harm—how much more so for one who relinquishes knowledge and forsakes form! Here, the meaning of Laozi’s words—\"dwelling where the crowd shuns, thus nearing the Dao\"—is expounded. Earlier, the parable of useful and useless trees was used; now, the analogy of man is even more incisive.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, Jie Yu, the Madman of Chu, wandered past his gate and sang:\n*\"Phoenix! Phoenix! How your virtue has waned!\nThe age to come cannot be awaited, the age past cannot be recalled.\nWhen the world follows the Dao, the sage achieves greatness;\nWhen the world loses the Dao, the sage merely survives.\nIn this present time, one barely escapes punishment.\nFortune is lighter than a feather, yet none know how to bear it;\nDisaster is heavier than the earth, yet none know how to avoid it.\nEnough! Enough! Cease this!\nTo govern others with virtue—how perilous!\nDangerous! Dangerous! To tread where one is barely safe!\nMark the ground and follow its lines—how deluded!\nDelusion upon delusion! Do not harm my path!\nI walk in crooked ways, lest I injure my feet.\"*\n\nMountain trees invite their own felling (the mountain nurtures them, yet they are cut down); fat fuels its own burning (fat gives light, thus hastening its consumption). Cinnamon is edible, so it is felled; lacquer is useful, so it is slashed. All know the use of the useful, but none know the use of the useless.\n\nThis sets forth the intent of \"Among the World of Men\": initially, it presents Confucius as a sage adept at navigating worldly affairs, thus framing the discourse through his voice. The implication is that even Yan Hui’s benevolence and wisdom are ill-suited for engagement with the world, for they risk the folly of forcing action where none is needed. Next, Lord She—himself a man of the world—proves unable to preserve his integrity, let alone others. Then there is Yan He, a mere recluse who, in his delusion, presumes to meddle in temporal matters, revealing his lack of self-awareness; thus, Boyi is invoked to rebuke him. All these are the faults of relying on talent, and none escape harm. Therefore, the text employs the parable of the useless oak and the mountain trees, and further clarifies with the tale of Master Disjointed. Such is the difficulty of navigating the world—hence, the chapter concludes with the madman of Chu mocking Confucius, suggesting that even a sage, if he fails to know when to stop, invites trouble. Here, the Old Master bares his heart and lays bare his true feelings, revealing the profound challenges of worldly existence. Thus, he transcends the mundane, preserving himself through the Dao, embracing poverty and lowliness, and withdrawing from the world without distress, composing texts to express his aspirations. This is the foundational intent of the discourse, and so it concludes \"Among the World of Men\" with this summation—truly, a self-portrait.\n\n---\n\n\"The Sign of Full Virtue\" establishes its intent thus: one whose virtue is fully realized within must be able to wander beyond the confines of the physical form, rather than remain shackled to the shell of the body. For one recognizes the body as the root of great affliction, and thus refrains from pursuing material desires, allowing the mind to roam with Heaven. Those who encounter such a person naturally find their spirits in accord, forgetting form and relinquishing cunning, unaware of how this comes to pass. Therefore, those who study the Dao must focus solely on cultivating full virtue within, without concern for hollow reputations displayed without. Though they do not seek recognition from the world, the world cannot fail to recognize them. Thus, the text invokes several exemplars to illustrate this, echoing Laozi’s notion of \"dwelling where the multitude shuns, and so drawing near the Dao.\"\n\nIn Lu, there was Wang Tai, a man who had lost his feet (the character *wu* here denotes one who has undergone foot amputation). Those who followed him were as numerous as those who followed Confucius. Chang Ji asked Confucius, \"Wang Tai is a man without feet, yet his followers rival yours in Lu (meaning half the state of Lu followed Wang Tai). He neither instructs when standing nor debates when seated. Yet those who go to him empty return full.\"\n\nIndeed, is there not a teaching without words, a shaping without form that perfects the heart? (This speaks of instruction that manifests not in appearance or speech, but only through heart-to-heart resonance.) What manner of man is this?\n\nConfucius replied, \"He is a sage. I merely follow behind and have yet to approach him. (This means I simply remain behind him, unable to advance to his level.) I would take him as my teacher—how much more should those inferior to me! Why limit myself to Lu? I would lead all under Heaven to follow him.\"\n\nChang Ji said, \"He is a man without feet, yet he surpasses others. The distance between you and him is vast. If this is so, his use of the heart must be singular. How is this possible?\"\n\nConfucius replied, \"Life and death are great matters, yet they do not cause him to change. Though heaven and earth should collapse, he would not be lost or burdened. (This means that even if heaven and earth were to overturn, he would not be troubled by such changes.) He abides in the unborrowed and does not shift with things. (Abides: to dwell. The unborrowed refers to the true Dao beyond the physical form, transcending all things, thus unaffected by their changes.) He names the transformations of things yet guards their root. (This means he stands beyond things, not shifting with them, allowing things to transform naturally while he guards the root of the supreme Dao.)\"\n\nChang Ji asked, \"What does this mean?\"\n\nConfucius replied, \"(I will show you the principle of forgetting form and guarding the true.) From the perspective of differences, the liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue. (This means that for one who cannot forget form to perceive the Dao, even the liver and gallbladder within the same body seem as distant as Chu and Yue.) From the perspective of sameness, the myriad things are one. (From the view of the great Dao, all things and I are one.) If this is so, he does not know what the ears and eyes should perceive, (Having forgotten the physical form, the six senses are of no use, thus effacing perception and hearing.) and his heart roams in the harmony of virtue. (This means he transcends the physical form and roams in the realm of great transformation, the境 of primordial harmony and original qi.) People see only what is unified in him and do not perceive what he has lost. (People, meaning others. Because he dwells in the midst of great transformation, others see only the truth of his Dao and do not perceive the loss of his form.) To him, losing a foot is like shedding dirt.\"\n\nChang Ji said, \"He has perfected himself. (Perfected: to stop, meaning he has reached this point and no further.) Through his knowledge, he has attained his heart; through his heart, he has attained the constant heart. (This means that through what he knows, he has attained his own heart, and through his heart, he has attained the heart common to all.) Why should things esteem him above others? (This means that the heart he has attained is possessed by everyone—why should it surpass others?)\"\n\nConfucius replied, \"People do not see their reflection in flowing water but in still water. Only stillness can still the stillness of others. (Confucius says that though everyone possesses this heart, the hearts of ordinary people are restless like flowing water, while the sage’s heart is as still as still water. Thus, the restless hearts of others can only be stilled by the sage.) Rooted in the earth, only the pine and cypress remain green through winter and summer. (The word *only* refers to the true unity of heaven and earth. Though the myriad things are many, this true unity resides only in the pine and cypress.) Endowed by heaven, only Shun was upright. (This means that only Shun received the upright mandate of heaven, embodying the correctness of life.) Fortunate to correct his life, he could correct the lives of others. (This means that having received the mandate of heaven, only Shun attained correctness, thus embodying the correctness of life. As one who has corrected himself, he could correct the incorrectness of others.) The proof of preserving the beginning lies in its fearlessness. (The beginning refers to the origin of the mandate, the root of the great Dao. The verification of the Dao lies in its true effect: fearlessness.) A single brave warrior can charge into nine armies. If one who seeks fame and can restrain himself is like this, how much more so one who governs heaven and earth, (The sage governs as the steward of heaven and earth,) gathers the myriad things, (Uniting all things into one,) lodges in the six senses, (Borrowing the six senses as a temporary abode,) treats the ears and eyes as mere semblances, (The ears and eyes are like puppets, what is called illusory,) unifies the knowledge of all knowing, (Knowing the unity of all transformations,) yet whose heart has never died? (Died: to lose. Ordinary people lose their original true heart, but the sage does not lose his inherent nature, thus seeing all things as one with himself.) He will choose a day to ascend on high. (On high: distant. He will choose a day to ascend far away, rising to the immortal realm and transcending the mundane.) People follow him in their affairs, (This means that those who follow him do so beyond the physical form.) but how would he deign to take things as his concern?\"\n\nThis chapter is titled \"Virtue as the Fulfilled Token.\" It begins with Wang Tai, the amputee, to expound this principle. Only in these final words is the true virtue inwardly fulfilled, thus manifesting outwardly.\n\nYet many follow him—not because he intends for them to do so. For when one forgets the bodily form and unifies the heart with knowing, this is what the Buddha calls breaking through the barrier of discriminating self. To break through this barrier is to attain the fruit of arhat, thereby gaining the transformations of spiritual powers. Here, however, Master Zhuang merely speaks from the human realm, showing how Laozi’s practice of forgetting form and releasing wisdom can reach this state—what is called the perfected person forgetting the self.\n\nThis relinquishing of the six senses, this making the ears and eyes mere images, this knowing of the one knowing, is what the Buddha calls the contemplation of the provisional. It is the wondrous key to emerging\n\nMany have mocked me for my incomplete feet, and I would bristle with anger. Yet when I came into your presence, Master, my resentment dissolved. I did not realize you had cleansed me with goodness. For nineteen years I have wandered with you, yet you never once saw me as maimed. Now you seek me beyond the body, while I move within it—is this not a mistake?\n\nZi Chan’s expression shifted, his face transformed, and he said, “You need say no more.”\n\nThis passage depicts the sage’s forgetting of merit, illustrated through Zi Chan’s awakening. When true virtue fills the inner self, the body becomes external, and one rests content in fate. When the Dao is mutually forgotten, all distinctions of self and other vanish. Such is the fruition of cultivating the Way.\n\nIn Lu there was a man named Shu Shan Wu Zhi, who had lost his toes. He came to Confucius on his heels and said, “You were careless before, and now you suffer this misfortune. Even now that you have come, it is too late!”\n\nWu Zhi replied, “I did not know what truly mattered and so recklessly used my body—thus I lost my feet. But now I come because what is more honorable than feet still remains, and I strive to preserve it whole. Heaven covers all without exception; Earth bears all without omission. I took you, Master, to be like Heaven and Earth—how could I have known you would still be so limited?”\n\nConfucius said, “I am indeed narrow-minded. Why do you not come in? Please share what you have heard.”\n\nWu Zhi departed. Confucius said to his disciples, “Take heed! Though Wu Zhi has lost his toes, he still strives to study and amend his past wrongs. How much more should one whose virtue is whole do so!”\n\nWu Zhi later said to Lao Dan, “Is Confucius not yet a perfected person? Why does he persist in treating me with such deference, as if I were his teacher? He seeks to be known for strange and marvelous feats, unaware that such pursuits are but shackles to the perfected person.”\n\nLao Dan replied, “Why not teach him to see life and death as a single thread, to regard right and wrong as one continuum, and thus free him from his shackles?”\n\nWu Zhi said, “It is Heaven’s mold—how can it be undone?”\n\nThis chapter expounds upon the sage’s forgetting of reputation, portraying Confucius as one who pursues empty fame rather than true virtue. Thus, he remains bound by rigid distinctions of right and wrong, good and evil, unaware that the perfected person transcends life and death, viewing worldly renown as mere shackles. For one who cannot forget life and death or unify right and wrong remains entangled in the common sentiments of the world. The sage, however, does not regard such attachments as true attainment.\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, “In Wei there was an ugly man named Ai Taituo. When men dwelled with him, they longed for him and could not bear to leave. When women saw him, they pleaded with their parents, saying, ‘I would rather be this man’s concubine than another’s wife’—and this was not just one or two. He never took the lead in anything, only ever harmonizing with others. He held no position of power to save others from death, nor did he amass wealth to fill their bellies. Moreover, his ugliness startled the world. He only followed, never led, and his wisdom did not extend beyond the ordinary. Yet when people disputed over right and wrong or victory and defeat, they turned to him to settle matters. There must have been something extraordinary about him. I summoned him to observe, and indeed, his ugliness startled the world. Yet after spending less than a month with me, I began to sense something admirable in his character. Before a year had passed, I trusted him completely. When the state had no chief minister, I offered him the governance of the realm. He responded with reluctance, as if unwilling, and when he spoke, it was with indifference, as though declining. I felt ashamed, yet in the end, I entrusted him with the state. Shortly after, he left me and departed. I grieved as though I had lost something, as though there were no one left to share the joy of ruling the land. What manner of man was he?”\n\nConfucius replied, “I once traveled to Chu and saw young [tun] apes feeding beside their dead mother. After a moment, they glanced at her unblinking eyes, then abandoned her and fled. They fled because they no longer saw themselves in her gaze, because she no longer resembled the mother they knew. What they loved in their mother was not her form but that which animated her form. The form is but a temporary vessel; that which animates it is the true master. The love of the [tun] apes for their mother is the love of Heaven’s nature. When she was alive, they fed beside her without ceasing to love her. But when she died, they first approached to feed, then saw her unblinking eyes and realized her spirit had departed. Thus, they abandoned her and fled—life and death are not far apart. They knew what they loved was not the mere body but the true master that animated it. Even the most foolish creatures understand this love of their Heaven-given nature—how much more should humans?\n\nWhen warriors die in battle, their burials are not adorned with *sha* banners (the great flags of generals). Though they once embodied courage, their bodies are lost, and such empty rituals lack substance. Likewise, a man who has lost his feet has no use for shoes, and no one cherishes them. Both examples illustrate the absence of what is truly essential. The attendants chosen for the Son of Heaven are not made to trim their nails or pierce their ears, for one does not mar the wholeness of the body to curry favor. A newlywed bride remains secluded and is not assigned further duties, lest her hands and feet become calloused. If even bodily wholeness is so valued, how much more so the person of complete virtue?”\n\nBut if merely preserving bodily wholeness is valued to such an extent, how much more so the person of complete virtue!\n\nThis is why the Lord of Lu loved Dai Ta—he forgot the form and cherished the root from which the form arises. There are things that defy verbal description, so the Master [Confucius] illustrated the lovableness of the root through three analogies.\n\nNow, consider Ai Dai Ta: though he had not spoken a word, he was trusted; though he had done no deeds, he was held dear. When others offered him the state, they feared only that he would not accept. Such trust without a word, such intimacy without merit, such willingness to entrust a kingdom—how could this be without reason? It must be that his talents were whole and his virtue unmanifest.\n\nDuke Ai asked, “What does it mean to have whole talents?”\n\nConfucius replied, “Life and death, existence and annihilation, success and failure, wealth and poverty, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of events and the workings of fate. They alternate day and night before us, yet knowledge cannot trace their beginnings. Thus, they are not enough to disturb harmony, nor can they enter the numinous abode. One who causes harmony and ease to flow freely without losing joy—this is to make day and night seamless, to interact with things as spring does, ever generating vitality in the heart. This is what it means to have whole talents.”\n\n“What does it mean for virtue to remain unmanifest?”\n\nConfucius said, “Stillness is the fullness of water at rest. It can serve as a model, for it preserves its inner state without external agitation. The completion of virtue is the cultivation of harmony. When virtue remains unmanifest, things cannot depart from it.”\n\nAnother day, Duke Ai told Min Zi, “At first, I believed that by facing south as ruler of the world, upholding the people’s order, and grieving over their deaths, I had attained the utmost understanding. Now, having heard the words of a perfected person, I fear I lack true substance, that I have treated my person lightly and lost my state. Confucius and I are not ruler and subject—we are friends in virtue.”\n\nThis chapter depicts the virtue of the sage, which must forget form to preserve nature, unify substance and function, harmonize inner and outer, and attain perfect equality and profound unity—only then is the work complete. Thus, the perfection of talent with unmanifest virtue is the ultimate attainment of the sage. For when talent is whole, inner and outer become one; when virtue remains unmanifest, self and others merge as one. This is the sage’s achievement, the sign of full virtue. Hence, the Lord of Lu, upon hearing this, could forget his rank, be moved and transformed, and befriend the sage.\n\nCrooked and crippled, his body incomplete, and armless, he persuaded Duke Ling of Wei. The duke was pleased with him and, looking upon whole men, saw their necks as slender. A man with a great goiter like a jar persuaded Duke Huan of Qi. The duke was pleased with him and, looking upon whole men, saw their necks as slender. Thus, virtue may excel while form is forgotten. These two men’s ugliness so delighted the two rulers that they came to see whole men as inferior—loving their virtue, they forgot their form.\n\nPeople forget what should be forgotten—nature—and remember what should not be forgotten—form. Now, if one does not forget what should be forgotten and forgets what should not be forgotten, this is called true forgetting. Thus, the sage wanders freely, while knowledge becomes a snare, restraint becomes glue, virtue becomes mere social engagement, and skill becomes commerce. The sage does not scheme—why use knowledge? He does not carve—why use glue? He suffers no loss—why use virtue? He does not trade—why use commerce? These four are artificial and corrupt true purity, so the sage discards them to preserve heavenly virtue.\n\nThese four are the nourishment of Heaven. What Heaven nourishes is Heaven’s sustenance. Having received sustenance from Heaven, why turn to man? One may have the form of a human but lack human emotions. Having the form of a human, one mingles with others; lacking human emotions, right and wrong do not cling to one. How minute and small—this is how one belongs to humanity. How vast and great—alone, one completes one’s Heaven.\n\nEarlier, though one may forget form through knowledge, knowledge still remains, and the subtlety of the Dao is not yet exhausted. Thus, this chapter speaks of forgetting even forgetting and knowledge. When knowledge is forgotten, virtue transforms naturally, aligning with spontaneity to fulfill heavenly virtue, and one’s virtue becomes full. Hence, the two rulers, seeing the two men, could overlook their form—this is the sign of virtue. The sage’s ultimate attainment of the Dao reaches its consummation here. Thus, this concludes the meaning of the entire chapter.\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi, “Do humans inherently lack emotions?”\nZhuangzi said, “Yes.”\nHuizi said, “If a human lacks emotions, how can one be called human?”\nZhuangzi said, “The Dao gives one appearance, Heaven gives one form—how can one not be called human?”\nHuizi said, “If one is called human, how can one lack emotions?”\nZhuangzi said, “This is not what I mean by emotions.”\n\nWhat I mean by lacking emotions is that one does not internally harm the body with likes and dislikes, but constantly follows one’s natural state without artificially augmenting life. Huizi said, “If one does not augment life, how can one possess a body?” Zhuangzi said, “The Dao gives one appearance, Heaven gives one form—do not internally harm the body with likes and dislikes. Now you externalize your spirit, exhaust your essence, lean against a tree chanting, and recline upon a withered catalpa zither in slumber. Heaven bestowed this form upon you, yet you clamor with ‘hard and white’—this is a great loss.”\n\nThis passage advocates forgetting emotions and eliminating desires to preserve the celestial virtue in its entirety—thus does one’s virtue become full. Having previously expounded the subtleties of preserving virtue whole, it concludes with the paradox that \"lacking emotions is not human,\" thereby thoroughly expressing the intent to eradicate emotions and preserve virtue, serving as a profound admonition to awaken the world and exhort the age.\n\n**Phonetic Annotations:**\n[穴欤] (*yú*, hollow)\n軱 (*gū*, large bone)\n謋 (*huò*, swift)\n蜃 (*shèn*, large clam used as a vessel)\n樠 (*mén*, oily secretion)\n[木且] (*zhā*, wooden fence)\n诊 (*zhěn*, divination of horses)\n藾 (*lài*, shade)\n咶 (*shì*, to lick)\n杙 (*yì*, stake for trapping beasts)\n[木单] (*chàn*, undivided side of a coffin plank)\n繲 (*xiè*, to wash clothes)\n翣 (*shà*, feathered ornaments on a coffin)\n謷 (*áo*, grand appearance)\n\n*Scroll Four: The Great and Venerable Teacher*\n\nZhuangzi’s writings declare themselves to have a guiding principle in speech and a sovereign in affairs—meaning that his words have a master and are not idle discourse. The division of his work into Inner and Outer Chapters reflects his teaching of the Dao of \"inner sageliness and outer kingliness.\" To grasp this great Dao in the heart is to become a sage within; when compelled by circumstance to engage with the world, one becomes an emperor or king without. This is a teaching of both essence and function, not empty words.\n\nMoreover, the seven Inner Chapters follow a sequential progression. *Free and Easy Wandering* elucidates the sage of complete embodiment—one who is \"great and transformed,\" serving as the foundational principle and central intent of the entire work. Next, *The Equality of Things* observes that throughout the ages, people fail to comprehend the origin of the great Dao and each clings to their own views as correct, thus engaging in mutual disputation. Beginning with the conflicts between Confucians and Mohists—both of whom, though unaware of the great Dao, insist on the absolute truth of their partial and biased teachings—all remain obstinate and unyielding, deluded about their true master and falsely asserting their own perspectives as right. Thus, from ancient times to the present, no one of great awakening has arisen to correct this, a lamentable confusion of the world born of clinging to self-opinion.\n\n*The Secret of Caring for Life* then explains that people, deluded about their true master, mistakenly take their flesh-and-blood bodies as themselves. Everyone seeks only their own advantage, pursuing fame, rank, and profit to nourish their form, unaware that they are harming their true master. This is the universal delusion of all ages—none know what truly sustains them. If one can nurture the master of life, one transcends the harms of material desire and does not live in vain. Truly knowing the life that sustains life, one may recover celestial authenticity and preserve the integrity of the Dao-body—this is attaining the essence of the sage.\n\n*Human World* addresses the learning of worldly engagement. It teaches that worldly affairs cannot be approached with preconceived intentions or reckless involvement. Those who seek reputation or rely on talent to act presumptuously invariably harm their lives and injure their natures. Even figures like Yanzi and Duke She, who acted without accepting fate or self-knowledge, exemplify this. Only the sage, forgetting the self and emptying the mind to wander through the world, responds only when unavoidable—thus avoiding calamity. The difficulties of worldly engagement are fully revealed here. To navigate the world without harm is the great function of the sage.\n\n*Signs of Full Virtue* clarifies that the sage, forgetting form and releasing wisdom, embodies both essence and function, moving with the Dao without intent toward the world—this is the sign of full virtue. *The Great and Venerable Teacher* synthesizes the six preceding themes: the Dao is complete, virtue is perfected, and all is harmoniously transformed. Self, merit, and fame are forgotten. Those called \"perfected persons,\" \"spiritual persons,\" or \"sages\" must be thus—only then can they be revered as teachers for all ages, hence the title *The Great and Venerable Teacher*. This is the great sage of complete embodiment, signifying that the learning of inner sageliness reaches its ultimate here—this is attaining its essence. When compelled by circumstance to engage with the world, one may become a sagely emperor or enlightened king. Thus, *Responding to Emperors and Kings* concludes the Inner Chapters.\n\nThe Outer Chapters expand upon and elaborate the ideas of the Inner Chapters. \"To know the workings of Heaven and the workings of humanity is perfection\" (here, \"know\" refers to true knowledge, meaning profound awakening. \"Heaven\" denotes the natural great Dao, the guiding principle of all things. \"Workings\" refers to the transformations of Heaven and Earth and the myriad things, which are the manifestations of the great Dao’s complete body—thus \"the workings of Heaven.\" For Heaven acts without intention, yet subtly completes the myriad things. \"The workings of humanity\" refers to humans, who receive the great Dao as one of the myriad things, yet are the most spiritually endowed. Endowed with the great Dao’s complete body as their nature, they govern their forms—this is the so-called true master. Thus, human perception, cognition, and daily activities are all governed by the true master; every moment is the wondrous function of the great Dao. To know humanity is to know Heaven. If one knows the unity of Heaven and humanity, this is the perfection of knowledge).\n\n\"To know the workings of Heaven is to be born of Heaven\" (to know the great Dao within humans, received at birth). \"To know the workings of humanity is to use what knowledge knows to nurture what knowledge does not know, thus fulfilling one’s Heaven-appointed years without premature death—this is the flourishing of knowledge\" (\"What knowledge knows\" refers to the knowledge of daily perception and cognition. \"What knowledge does not know\" refers to the originally inherent wondrous nature, which people, deluded, fail to awaken to, thus remaining unaware in daily life. Due to this unawareness, though it exists, they only know how to indulge desires to nourish the form, unaware of releasing wisdom and forgetting form to nurture their nature. Thus, the world is universally deluded by material desires, harming life and injuring nature, unable to fully realize their nature and complete their lives to fulfill their Heaven-appointed years. If one can, in daily life, abandon greed and detach from desires, illuminate the mind in every circumstance, turn the light inward to reflect, and recover one’s nature—this is using what knowledge knows to nurture what knowledge does not know. Such profound awakening is the flourishing of knowledge).\n\nYet there is a danger: for knowledge to be appropriate, it must depend on something, but what it depends on is not yet certain. (The phrase \"yet there is a danger\" means that while I speak of using what is known to nurture what is unknown, there remains a flaw. Why? Because people have long been deluded by false knowledge, relying on it to feign understanding where there is none, mistaking ignorance for awakening, and acting recklessly—thus harming their nature. Only when true awakening and true knowledge are attained can it be truly appropriate. Yet what one depends on to awaken may not be genuine awakening; if one clings to it as already awakened, it cannot be considered certain.)\n\nIf one truly awakens to the core, where Heaven and humanity merge in virtue and the original state is undivided, only then can it be called true knowledge.\n\nYet how can we be sure that what I call \"Heaven\" is not actually humanity? Or that what I call \"humanity\" is not actually Heaven? Only when there is a true person does true knowledge arise. (This means that when I speak of nurturing Heaven through humanity, I do not imply that there is some wondrous Dao beyond the daily activities of human life. For Heaven is humanity, and humanity is the Great. It is a matter of awakening to the original undivided state, where nothing is lacking. Only when one truly knows that Heaven and humanity are one can one be called a true person.)\n\nThis passage is the central thesis of the entire text, with the character \"knowledge\" (*zhi*) as its focal point. As the ancients said: \"The character *zhi* (knowledge) is the gateway to all wonders; the character *zhi* is also the gateway to all calamities.\" For only after profound awakening does true knowledge arise; one who possesses true knowledge is called a true person and may be revered as a teacher. Yet knowing Heaven and knowing humanity is the gateway to all wonders. Nevertheless, there is a danger: the very character *zhi* (knowledge) is also the gateway to all calamities. This refers to those who feign knowledge where there is none, relying on false understanding to act recklessly—thus turning knowledge into harm. This is the common affliction of the world’s clever.\n\nWhat, then, is a true person? (Here, the text invokes the true person to show that what they nurture is profound and far removed from the ordinary.) The true persons of old did not reject the few (the few refers to those of meager virtue and little wisdom; \"not reject\" means they did not spurn them), did not assert their own achievements (asserting oneself means relying on one’s own virtue; \"achievements\" refers to considering oneself complete in virtue; they did not use their own virtue to provoke the world), and did not scheme (scheming refers to plotting; this means they were without intention in matters, moving through the world with an empty mind, never allowing affairs to trouble their hearts). Such a one (a true person living thus in the world) does not regret mistakes nor take pride in correctness. Such a one ascends heights without fear, enters water without getting wet, and walks through fire without feeling heat—this is knowledge that can ascend to the Dao. (This means the true person moves through the world without intention, free from concerns of gain or loss, advantage or harm. Unattached to things in mind, water and fire cannot harm them. This is to abandon things and preserve one’s nature, where knowledge can ascend to the distant Dao.)\n\nIn this way (the true person, forgetting the world while in it), the true persons of old slept without dreaming (dreams arise from deluded thoughts; since the true person’s mind is unattached to things, deluded thoughts do not arise, and thus they sleep without dreams), awoke without worry (the true person moves through the world with an empty mind, free from concerns of gain or loss, and thus awakes without worry), ate without savoring taste (finding joy in the Dao, they do not delight in flavors), and breathed deeply (deep means continuous and unbroken. Coarse and shallow breathing indicates a restless mind; the true person’s mind is tranquil and unmoved by things, and thus their breath is deep). The true person’s breath reaches their heels (this explains the meaning of \"deep.\" The heel is the base of the foot, symbolizing the profound and unfathomable origin of the breath, where the mind is settled and undisturbed), while the breath of ordinary people reaches only their throat (the breath of ordinary people is at the throat, extremely coarse and shallow, and thus restless and deluded, their minds constantly chasing after things and unaware of the Dao).\n\nThose who are submissive and servile speak as if vomiting from their throats (a restless mind leads to hasty speech; words not arising from the center are easily bent to submission. The throat is the passage for speech; \"vomiting\" means shallow, coarse words are spat out without root). The deeper one’s cravings, the shallower one’s heavenly mechanism (this means that those who are so coarse and shallow are deeply mired in desires, which cloud their true nature and leave them entirely ignorant of their innate wondrous nature. They are trapped in false knowledge and lack true knowledge).\n\nThis passage describes how the true person’s profound awakening to their original nature constitutes true knowledge, and thus what they nurture is far removed from the ordinary. From the perspective of the common person, they appear entirely distinct. The earlier warning of danger refers precisely to the harm caused by those who have not awakened but cling to false knowledge as if it were true. Thus, the text clarifies both sides.\n\nThe true persons of old did not delight in life nor detest death (earlier, the text briefly described how the true person lives in the world, forgetting advantage and harm; here, it explains that the true person not only forgets advantage and harm but also transcends life and death. United with the great Dao, they awaken to the truth that life is fundamentally non-life, and thus do not delight in it; they awaken to the truth that death is fundamentally non-death, and thus do not detest it). Their departure brings no joy, their return no resistance (departure and return refer to life and death, as Laozi said: \"Birth is departure, death is return.\" Since they do not delight in life, they do not cling to it. \"Joy\" here means clinging. Since they do not detest death, they do not resist it. \"Resistance\" means clawing and refusing to enter). They come and go with effortless ease (effortless ease is like the sound of a crane taking flight, its wings brushing the air. This means the true person moves through the world without intention, coming and going through life and death as if wandering the vast emptiness, utterly free and unobstructed. Thus, it is said: \"merely thus\").\n\nThey do not forget their beginning nor seek their end (awakening to the truth that life is fundamentally non-life, they do not forget their origin; since life wanders with the Dao and does not see the world as something to depart from, merging the ten thousand things into one, they do not seek an end). They accept and delight in it, forget and return to it (ordinary people see life as a burden and thus suffer and do not delight in it. The true person carries the Dao in life and thus delights in receiving form. Though living in the world, their mind does not stray from the Dao, forgetting the world and returning at every moment). This is called not using the mind to abandon the Dao, not using humanity to assist Heaven—this is the true person. (The mind wanders with the Dao, and thus does not abandon it.)\n\nTo abandon is to cast away. Man is Heaven—no fabrication or cultivation is needed, thus one does not use man to assist Heaven. Only thus is one called a true person.\n\nThis passage speaks of the true person wandering in the world, forgetting not only profit and harm but also life and death. Though their body dwells among men, their mind transcends the realm of things. Without true knowledge and wondrous awakening, one cannot easily attain this, for it reveals the depth of their cultivation.\n\nThose who are thus—\ntheir will is serene,\ntheir countenance still,\ntheir brow broad and unconstrained.\n*(Those who are thus refer to the true person’s wandering in the world, their appearance unlike others. Their will is serene—*the *Bi Sheng* reads \"forgetful,\" meaning they are without worldly concerns. Their countenance is still, for within they are profound and without they are composed. Their brow is broad, signifying a bearing vast and magnanimous, free from petty restraint. This is what Laozi meant by \"the bearing of great virtue, following only the Dao.\")*\nChill as autumn *(their face stern and cold, like the solemnity of autumn air)*,\nwarm as spring *(when one draws near, their inner warmth and kindness make them endearing and lovable)*,\njoy and anger flow with the four seasons,\nharmonizing with things as they arise, yet none know their limit.\n*(They are without fixed joy or anger, responding only to what moves them, now glad, now angry, with no constancy within. Thus they flow with the seasons and harmonize with things, yet others do not perceive their absence of joy or anger. Hence, none know their limit.)*\n\nTherefore, when the sage employs arms,\nthey may destroy a state yet not lose the people’s hearts.\nTheir beneficence extends through ten thousand generations,\nyet they do not act out of love for men.\n*(The sage is without intent in governing, their virtue merging with Heaven’s dispensation. Even when compelled to use arms, though they destroy a state, they do not lose the people’s hearts, for they harbor no intent to kill. Though their grace extends through ages, it is not born of deliberate love. This is the meaning of Heaven giving life and Heaven taking it away.)*\n\nThus, one who delights in harmonizing with things is no sage *(to willfully seek harmony with things is not natural)*;\none who has favorites is not benevolent *(great benevolence is without partiality. Favoritism is a private affection, not true benevolence. Hence it is said, \"No greater thief of virtue than intent.\")*;\none who calculates the times is not worthy *(to weigh circumstances is not to follow destiny)*;\none who does not comprehend profit and harm is no gentleman *(the wise preserve themselves—this is what makes a gentleman. To be ignorant of profit and harm, acting recklessly, is no gentleman)*;\none who pursues fame at the cost of self is no scholar *(to feign virtue for empty renown is no true scholar)*;\none who loses themselves without authenticity is no master of others *(to sacrifice oneself for others is to command obedience; but to cling to self and die for fame is to be enslaved by things, not to master them).*\n\nLike Hu Bujie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di—these are slaves to others’ service, conforming to others’ paths, yet never walking their own.\n*(These men, though learned, lacked true knowledge. They died for fame and lost their essence, far from the sages.)*\n\nThis passage broadly states that without true knowledge, one cannot forget self or fame, cannot be free of intent for praise, cannot die for fame and lose essence—all are not the true knowledge of the sage. Below, it further distinguishes the true person’s true knowledge from the rest.\n\nThe true person of old—\ntheir bearing was upright *(neither affirming nor denying)* yet not partisan *(their heart harmonious yet not adrift)*,\nseeming insufficient *(utterly empty)* yet not submissive *(as if receiving nothing)*;\nthey were companionable *(at ease in the world)* yet angular without rigidity *(though distinct and unyielding, they were not inflexible)*,\nexpansive *(in conduct)* yet empty without ostentation *(though active, their center was void, not prizing splendor)*;\ncheerful *(radiant with joy)* yet without intent for joy,\nyielding *(humble and modest)* yet compelled *(though humble in dealing with others, it was but a reluctant response)*,\nplacid *(like still water)* in their countenance *(their inner calm manifesting in their face)*,\nharmonious *(in company)* in their virtue *(others could not bear to leave their presence)*,\naustere *(stern and unassailable)* yet worldly *(appearing grave like the world’s dignitaries)*,\nlofty *(beyond restraint)* yet ungovernable *(seeming beyond ritual and law, not to be bound by them)*,\nreserved *(restrained and composed)* yet seemingly withdrawn *(though restrained, they were not truly closed off)*,\nsubdued *(humble)* as if forgetting their words.\n\nWith punishment as their essence *(punishment here means no private attachments—no selfishness remained in their core)*,\nritual as their wings *(though forgetting ritual, they still used it to navigate the world)*,\nknowledge as their timing *(true knowledge of when to act or refrain)*,\nvirtue as their guide *(using virtue to follow the flow of circumstances)*.\nTo take punishment as essence is to be ample in their restraint *(ample means excess—cutting away all selfish desires, leaving none, yet still diminishing them)*;\nto take ritual as wings is to move through the world *(once wandering in the world, one cannot step beyond ritual and law)*;\nto take knowledge as timing is to act only when compelled *(responding only when unavoidable)*;\nto take virtue as their guide is to say, with those who have feet, they reach the heights. *(The heights refer to lofty places.)*\n\nTo speak of following the flow of circumstances is to guide and enlighten the ignorant, allowing all who possess understanding to ascend in the Dao. Thus it is likened to those with feet being led to the heights. These four phrases elucidate the earlier four—punishment, ritual, knowledge, and virtue.\n\nYet people truly mistake this for diligent practice (Laozi says, “Its use is never strained”—strained meaning laborious. The true person wanders through the world without intent, moving yet never toiling).\n\nThis passage depicts the wondrous state of the true person’s empty-hearted wandering in the world: though transcending the world, they never depart from it; though mingling with others, they do not flock with them. This is the essence of true knowledge.\n\nThus, whether they favor it or not, it is one and the same (The *thus* arises from the singularity of their wandering in the world, achieving the union of Heaven and humanity. To favor it is Heaven; not to favor it is humanity. Now both are one—this is called the union of Heaven and humanity).\n\nWhether unified or not, it is one (The *one* refers to the unity of Heaven and humanity. When Heaven and humanity unite and return to the Dao, then the myriad things, though diverse and not one, all merge into the Dao).\n\nThose who are one become companions of Heaven (When humanity unites with Heaven, humanity and Heaven become one, and humanity may thus become Heaven’s companion). Those who are not one become companions of others (Originally, Heaven and humanity were not one. Now, though humanity has united with Heaven, they still wander in the human world, moving with Heaven yet keeping company with others). Heaven and humanity do not overcome one another—this is the true person (If one were to transcend the world entirely, it would be Heaven overcoming humanity; if one were to lose their nature in pursuit of things, it would be humanity overcoming Heaven. But when Heaven and humanity unite in virtue, neither harms the other, and thus neither overcomes. Only thus is one a true person).\n\nThis passage concludes the earlier work of knowing Heaven and knowing humanity, achieving a seamless unity where Heaven and humanity merge. Only then can one follow their natural truth, being in Heaven as Heaven, in humanity as humanity—Heaven and Earth sharing the same root, the myriad things forming one body. Thus Heaven and humanity do not overcome one another. Only through such true knowledge, profound realization, and complete transformation can one be called a true person. How could this be grasped by forced understanding or deluded perception!\n\nThis is the full achievement of the true person’s true learning. Thus, the following chapter begins with “Life and death are fate” and continues through the “Hiding the Boat” chapter, urging people to study the Dao and engage in true practice.\n\nLife and death are fate (Hereafter, one is taught to master the work of life and death. *Fate* refers to what is natural and inescapable); their constancy is like night and day—this is Heaven (Human life and death are like the alternation of night and day, inescapable. Moreover, yin and yang have night and day, yet the great void remains eternally unchanged, without dusk or dawn. This illustrates that though the human form undergoes life and death, the true nature remains constant and unchanging, like the unchanging void—thus it is called Heaven).\n\nWhat humanity cannot intervene in (pronounced *yù*) is the nature of things (The true nature resides in humanity, inherently complete, with not a trace of human effort able to interfere. This is the true essence shared by all, what is called the true master or celestial ruler. This must be cultivated before it can be known).\n\nThey take Heaven as their father (All people receive their true nature and take form, naturally complete—thus they take Heaven as their father). Yet they still cherish their bodies—how much more should they cherish that which is transcendent! (This transient body of blood and flesh owes its existence to one’s worldly father, and one nurtures it with filial devotion to honor their father. How much more should one honor and cultivate the celestial ruler that bears one’s form, transcendent and not bound to the body!)\n\nPeople take having a lord as superior to themselves and are even willing to die for him—how much more should they do so for the true! (Moreover, people know they have a lord and wish to serve him with utmost loyalty, even to the point of death. How much more should they serve the true lord that governs their form, forgetting the body to attend to it with devotion! To fail to do so is the height of folly. These words are deeply stirring—who could read them and not awaken?)\n\nThis speaks of the true nature within us, which does not belong to life and death, being the everlasting nature. Yet people are deluded and do not awaken, their desires harming it while they remain unaware of its cultivation—is this not the utmost foolishness?\n\nWhen springs dry up, fish find themselves together on dry land, warming one another with moisture, moistening one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes (Laozi says: “Lose the Dao, then virtue; lose virtue, then benevolence; lose benevolence, then righteousness.” This takes fish out of water as losing the Dao and virtue, then benevolence and righteousness. Moreover, to uphold benevolence and righteousness is like moistening one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. This illustrates that one must forget benevolence and righteousness to wander in the realm of the great Dao).\n\nRather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, it is better to forget both and embody the Dao (Without praise or blame, good and evil are both forgotten, uniting with the Dao—this is the flourishing of true knowledge).\n\nThe great clod (Heaven and Earth) burdens me with form, wearies me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to be good to my life is to be good to my death (Human life in Heaven and Earth, the toil and ease of life and death, are all natural and inescapable—this is fate. This is what is called humanity. If one knows where fate is bound, the Dao is present. Thus, knowing humanity leads to knowing Heaven. If one understands that Heaven and humanity are originally not two, then one merges seamlessly with the Dao, not allowing humanity to harm Heaven).\n\nEmbracing emptiness, one roams the world to fulfill one’s great years, never forgetting the Dao in life. Thus it is said: \"To be good to my life is to be good to my death.\" Here, Heaven and humanity merge in virtue, death and life remain unchanged, and one follows the spontaneity of creation—this is the perfection of knowledge.\n\nThis speaks of how worldly people, ignorant of the great Dao, regard benevolence and righteousness as supreme. Thus they love their kin with benevolence and serve their lords unto death. Though this may seem good, it is not truly so—like fish in a dried-up spring, gasping and moistening one another with foam. If one could awaken to the great Dao in its wholeness, then the myriad things would form a single body, and good and evil would both be forgotten—like fish forgetting one another in the rivers and lakes. Only then can one be said to know Heaven and know humanity, merging Heaven and humanity in virtue, and transcending beyond life and death. In ancient times, whether in life or in death, there was nothing that was not good.\n\nHiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh may seem secure, yet in the dead of night, a strong man may carry them away, and the unwitting will not perceive it. (Hiding one’s celestial truth within form is like hiding a boat in a ravine; hiding form within Heaven and Earth is like hiding a mountain in a marsh. This may seem secure—such is the fixed view of ordinary people. Yet the subtle shifts of creation, though even Heaven and Earth are transformed by them, go unnoticed by the common folk, just as the unwitting do not perceive when a strong man carries things away.)\n\nEven when concealing the small within the great as is fitting, there is still escape. But if one hides the world within the world, there is no escape—this is the great truth of all things. (If one knows that this body, together with Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, is originally one with the Dao, merging seamlessly with the great transformation without distinction, then one hides the formless within the formless. In this way, there is no escape—like hiding the world within the world, where no escape is possible. This is the true reality of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, hence the great truth of all things.)\n\nYet people delight in possessing human form. If human form is but one of the myriad transformations, never reaching an end, how can its joy be measured? (Creation’s transformations are boundless, and humanity is but one among the myriad things. Yet people, unaware of this, take delight in having obtained a human body. If this is so, then all things possess their own joy—how can its measure be calculated?)\n\nThus the sage roams where things cannot escape, and all are preserved. Whether in premature death or long life, in beginning or end, all is good, and people emulate this. How much more so for that on which the myriad things depend and by which the one transformation is sustained? (The origin of the great Dao is the root and source of the myriad things, hence it is called \"that on which they depend.\" Without it, the myriad things cannot be harmonized into one, hence it is called \"that by which the one transformation is sustained.\" This is truly the great origin of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things—the very source that the sage venerates and takes as teacher. Can one fail to awaken to this?)\n\nThis elucidates that the great Dao is formless and is the root of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. Each person receives this formless great Dao and is born—this is the true master. If one awakens to this great Dao, then Heaven, Earth, the myriad things, body, mind, and world all dissolve and merge into one. One who thoroughly comprehends this principle is called the Great Ancestral Master—this is what is meant by \"great and transformed, one is called a sage.\" At this stage, there is no self, no merit, no fame; one roams freely above the myriad things, transcending the path of life and death.\n\nYet most people do not grasp the wonder of this great Dao, clinging instead to their petty knowledge and views, asserting their own rightness. Unable to roam freely, they each hold fast to their own opinions, mutually affirming and negating, thus losing the master of their own lives. Seeking fame and profit in the world, their virtue does not match their destiny. This is why the previous five chapters, though expounding these truths, did not fully reveal them. Thus, this chapter begins by establishing that knowing Heaven and knowing humanity, possessing true knowledge, one becomes a true person. It proceeds directly to this point, finally pointing to the Great Ancestral Master—precisely the teaching that Laozi and Zhuangzi took as their foundation. Only thus is the matter settled.\n\nThereafter, the text returns to the single word \"Dao\" to elaborate, demonstrating the coherence of its argument from beginning to end. Though the words may seem expansive, their meaning has a single source—this is evident here.\n\nThe Dao (the above describes the appearance of the Great Ancestral Master, concluding the previous meaning. The Great Ancestral Master is that which is revered. The great Dao, as mentioned earlier, is that which the myriad things preserve and by which the one transformation is sustained—what is this? It is the great Dao. Thus, what follows elaborates on the wonder of the great Dao, clarifying the meaning of \"that which the myriad things preserve\" and \"that by which the one transformation is sustained.\" The intent is drawn from Laozi’s \"Heaven obtains the One and becomes clear,\" etc.) has essence and trustworthiness (this speaks of the substance and function of the great Dao. The *Qi Wu* chapter says, \"It can be formed and is trustworthy\"—having essence without form refers precisely to this. This is drawn from Laozi’s \"Dark and obscure, within it there is essence; its essence is most true, within it there is trustworthiness.\" Here, \"having essence\" means that though empty, it has a real substance and does not lose its function—this is called \"trustworthiness\"), is non-active and formless (abiding in stillness, hence non-active; transcending names and appearances, hence formless). It can be transmitted but not received, can be attained but not seen (transmitted mind-to-mind, hence it can be transmitted and received; wondrously aligned beyond words, hence there is no receiving or attaining). It is self-originating and self-rooted (naturally so, not borrowed from elsewhere). Before Heaven and Earth existed, it was already eternally present (Heaven and Earth are established by it, hence it existed prior to them). It spiritually animates ghosts and gods, gives birth to Heaven and Earth (its transformations are unfathomable, making it the master of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things).\n\nEre the Great Ultimate it dwells yet is not exalted (Fu Xi drew the trigrams beginning with the Great Ultimate; yet when traced further upward, there is still something beyond—thus it is not deemed exalted). Beneath the Six Poles it abides yet is not profound (encompassing Heaven and Earth, containing the Six Directions, thus it is not deemed profound). Before Heaven and Earth were born it existed yet is not ancient (by its eternal presence, it is not deemed ancient). Older than high antiquity it endures yet is not aged (the myriad transformations shift imperceptibly, yet this Dao remains serene—thus it does not age).\n\nWhen Fu Wei (an ancient sovereign) attained it, he used it to lift Heaven and Earth (assisting in transformation and ordering the world). When Fu Xi (of the Three August Ones) attained it, he drew upon the Mother of Qi (to *draw upon* is to take; the Mother of Qi is the root of all life—*drawing upon the Mother of Qi* is as Laozi sought sustenance from the Mother). When the Northern Dipper (the pivot of Heaven) attained it, it never erred through all antiquity (erring means deviation; the Northern Dipper, Heaven’s axis, remains unmoving—thus it does not deviate). When the sun and moon attained it, they never ceased through all antiquity (moving without end, functioning without exhaustion). When Kan Huai (a divine being of Kunlun, shaped like a beast) attained it, he inherited Kunlun (here *inherited* means to uphold, signifying his stewardship of Kunlun). When Feng Yi (the River Earl) attained it, he roamed the great rivers. When Jian Wu (a mountain spirit) attained it, he dwelled on Mount Tai. When the Yellow Emperor (Xuanyuan) attained it, he soared through the cloudy heavens (riding a dragon to ascend as an immortal). When Zhuan Xu (one of the Five Emperors) attained it, he resided in the Dark Palace. When Yu Qiang (the god of the Northern Sea, described in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* as \"a spirit on the Dark Isle, with a human face and bird’s body, wearing two blue serpents as earrings and treading two serpents,\" named Yu Qiang) attained it, he stood at the Northern Pole (the extremity of the Northern Sea). When the Queen Mother of the West (the immortal sovereign of the Jasper Pool) attained it, she sat in the Lesser Expanse (the palace where the Queen Mother dwells).\n\nNone know its beginning, none know its end (these two lines summarize the foregoing: the sages and divine beings who govern Heaven, Earth, sun, moon, and stars all rely on the Great Dao—thus none know its beginning or end. This directly transforms the passage in Laozi where \"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear\").\n\nWhen Peng Zu (surnamed Qian, an ancient paragon of longevity) attained it, his years spanned from the age of Yu to the Five Hegemons (legend holds Peng Zu lived eight hundred years, thus ranging from the time of Yu to the Five Hegemons). When Fu Yue (the worthy minister of Wu Ding) attained it, he assisted Wu Ding, riding the Eastern Ridge and straddling the Tail of the Milky Way to join the ranks of the stars (the star Fu Yue lies above the Tail; this describes his position between the Eastern Ridge and the Tail of the Milky Way).\n\nThis clarifies that the Great Ancestral Master is what is revered—the Great Dao. For the Great Dao is the master of Heaven and Earth, the myriad things, and divine beings. Now, every person is endowed with this Great Dao at birth, dwelling within this bodily form as the master of life—what is called the innate nature. Since the form is borrowed while the nature is true, it is termed the True Sovereign. When one awakens to this Great Dao and thoroughly perceives the truth of nature, one can transcend the bodily form, directly merging with the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth, blending into oneness. Thus, one becomes the common ancestor of all beings in the world—hence the term *Great Ancestral Master*. This Great Ancestral Master is the divine being, sage, and perfected one spoken of in \"Free and Easy Wandering.\" The *having sentiment* and *trustworthiness* mentioned earlier are the True Sovereign of \"Equalizing Things\" and the Master of Life in the \"Nourishing Life\" chapter. If one does not awaken to this but engages with the world, one is inevitably beset by the great peril of the bodily form. Yanzi’s *fasting of the mind* teaches the method of awakening to it. Once the truth of nature is awakened, the bodily form can be transcended. Thus, in the preceding \"Signs of Full Virtue,\" all passages elaborate the states of delusion and awakening through the ages—only here is it clearly revealed. The entire discourse has now been laid bare. Thus it is said, \"Words have their source, affairs have their lord\"—this is precisely the meaning.\n\nThe foregoing has expounded the Great Dao, making it perfectly clear, but the work of entering the Dao has not yet been discussed. Thus, what follows describes the true practice of entering the Dao.\n\nNanbo Zikui asked Nü Gua (these are both double names; the author introduces these figures to set up a dialogue—there is no need to seek their historicity), \"You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like that of a child—how is this so?\" (He asks how, though aged, his countenance remains like an infant’s, using this to introduce the necessity of cultivation and to initiate the discussion of practice.) Nü Gua replied, \"I have heard the Dao.\" (This is meant to lead the other to study the Dao.)\n\nNanbo Zikui said, \"Can the Dao be learned?\" (Hearing that one has *heard the Dao*, he expresses astonishment, asking if the Dao can indeed be learned.) Nü Gua replied, \"Alas! How could it be so? (Both *alas* are read in the level tone, expressing surprise. The first *alas* laments the difficulty of speaking of the Dao; the second *alas* laments that the Dao is not easily learned—only the right person can do so.) You are not that person. (The Dao is not easily learned, much less by one who is not destined to learn it. How can this be known?)\n\nNow, Bu Liangyi possesses the talent of a sage (talent refers to one’s inborn endowment, akin to what is commonly called *natural disposition*) but lacks the Dao of a sage (he has fine qualities but no aspiration to enter the Dao). I possess the Dao of a sage but lack the talent of a sage (I have the Dao of a sage but lack fine qualities, thus I have endured much hardship). If I were to teach him, perhaps he might truly become a sage. (If I were to teach Bu Liangyi the Great Dao, he could be taught—but he lacks the aspiration.)\"\n\nCould his talent perhaps be cultivated to completion—yet who can say whether he might truly be shaped into a sage? If not, then to teach the Dao of the sage to one possessing the talent of a sage would be easy indeed. (Those who study the Dao and unite both talent and virtue in full measure are rare indeed. Yet with such complete endowment, learning comes easily.)\n\nI still persist in teaching him, and after three days he is able to put the world outside himself. (The world is distant and vast, thus three days suffice to set it aside. This describes the first stage of instruction.) Having put the world outside himself, I persist further, and after seven days he is able to put things outside himself. (Things are closer to the self, thus seven days are needed to forget them.) Having put things outside himself, I persist further, and after nine days he is able to put life outside himself. (Life is most intimate to the self, thus nine days of effort are required to set it aside.) Only after putting life outside himself can he attain morning clarity. (Morning is the break of day; clarity is radiant awakening. Having set life aside, he suddenly awakens as if from sleep, thus it is called morning clarity.) With morning clarity, he can then perceive the solitary. (The solitary refers to the awakening of the one true nature, no longer bound to the bodily form, thus it is called perceiving the solitary.) Perceiving the solitary, he can then transcend past and present. (Awakening to the one true nature transcends heaven and earth, thus it is no longer bound to past or present.) Transcending past and present, he can then enter the state of neither death nor life. (Having awakened to the true nature, transcending heaven and earth, and cutting off past and present, he perceives the original state of neither death nor life.)\n\nThat which kills life does not die. (Life is the burden of form. Having awakened to the true nature, the bodily form is set aside, and all worldly burdens dissolve, thus killing life leaves only the one nature, hence it does not die.) That which gives life to life does not live. (When form is transformed and nature is complete, it merges with the Dao in darkness and unity, giving rise to all living things. Yet the one true nature remains serene, thus it is said that which gives life to life does not live.)\n\nAs for this thing—(this refers to the essence of the Dao, which is neither death nor life)—there is nothing it does not carry, (This essence of the Dao undergoes endless transformations, thus there is nothing it does not carry. *Carry* means to bear or sustain.) nothing it does not welcome, (For the person who embodies it, every moment of daily life meets the source at every turn, thus there is nothing it does not welcome.) nothing it does not destroy, (This essence of the Dao refines all transformations, blunting sharpness and resolving entanglements, thus there is nothing it does not destroy.) and nothing it does not complete. (It manifests everywhere without need for contrivance.)\n\nThis is called *yīngníng*. (*Yīng* refers to the heart being disturbed by the dust of labor, chaos, and adversity; *níng* is the state of tranquility and serenity. The practitioner of the Dao emerges from all opposing and favorable conditions, reaching the point where no circumstance can disturb the heart, which remains settled and still.) *Yīngníng* is that which is completed only after enduring *yīng*. (This explains the meaning of *yīngníng*: it is achieved only through perseverance amid hardship.)\n\nThe preceding discourse on the Great Dao, though venerable and worthy of emulation, remains diffuse and without essential focus.\n\nThis passage now points to the method of learning the Dao. It means that although this Dao is inherent in everyone, since there are no born sages, one must cultivate it to achieve completion. For those who seek to learn, they must possess a fully refined root-capacity to be worthy of transmission and reception. The act of transmission and reception must not be careless; it requires the method of direct instruction, face-to-face guidance, and steadfast teaching. Nor can it be rushed; one must enter gradually, step by step. Thus, one awakens bit by bit: after three days, the world is transcended; after seven days, things are transcended; after nine days, life and death are transcended—only then does one perceive the solitary, attain clarity at dawn. Such is the effect of awakening.\n\nHaving awakened to this Dao, in every situation, in daily life at every turn, it manifests spontaneously, unobstructed in all directions. Though amidst the dust and toil of the world, the heart remains profoundly settled and serene, the ruler of the mind at peace, undisturbed and still. When practice reaches this point, it is called *yīngníng*. What is *yīngníng*? It is that which is accomplished only after enduring entanglements—thus it is said to be completed only after *yīng*.\n\nThough this elder’s words may seem diffuse, the work of cultivating the Dao all arises from perseverance amid hardship; it is not achieved lightly. How can those who read his words today regard them merely as literature?\n\nThe preceding discussion concerns the work of entering the Dao, while the following speaks of hearing the Dao—this, too, arises from awakening through words. Thus, it is expressed with reiteration.\n\nNanbo Zikui said, “Where did you alone hear this?” He replied, “I heard it from the son of *fumo* (*fumo* refers to writing—it means it first came from words). The son of *fumo* heard it from the grandson of *luosong* (*luosong* means reciting and studying texts—it implies that through long recitation and study, one naturally attains understanding). The grandson of *luosong* heard it from *zhanming* (*zhanming* means seeing where there is clarity—it refers to awakening through words). *Zhanming* heard it from *nieshu* (*nieshu* means hearing with the ears, where sound enters the heart and the heart assents). *Nieshu* heard it from *xuyi* (*xu* means waiting; *yi* means employing—it means that though the heart has awakened, one must wait to verify it in action, manifesting it clearly in all situations, aligning with the Dao, and only then attaining subtlety). *Xuyi* heard it from *yuu* (*yuu* means immersing and chanting). *Yuu* heard it from *xuanming* (through immersion and chanting, one merges with the profound in the heart—this is the ultimate attainment of the Dao). *Xuanming* heard it from *canliao* (*canliao* refers to the vast, empty, and boundless state—it signifies the true reality of the Dao). *Canliao* heard it from *yishi* (it means entering the beginningless—this is the ultimate return of the completion of learning the Dao).”\n\nThis passage explains that even the sage who attains the Great Dao does not do so without hearing. It arises from enlightenment through words and speech, extending to all actions, chanting, and even the slightest utterances, merging with the profound and obscure, entering the vast and boundless, and reaching the unknowable beginning. Only after such deep realization and verification does it end—this cannot be attained merely through words or hearing. Only then can one be called a great master.\n\nThe foregoing has elucidated the Great Dao as worthy of veneration, and those who awaken to it may be called masters. But has anyone truly attained this? Lest the world dismiss it as empty talk, the following introduces Zisi and others as genuine adepts of the Dao, serving as evidence.\n\nZisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai spoke to one another, saying, “Who can take non-being as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tail? Who knows that life and death, existence and extinction, are one body—with such a one, I would be friends.” The four looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord, and so they became friends.\n\nZiyu fell ill, and Zisi went to visit him. Ziyu said, “How mighty is the Creator, to make me like this—so constrained!” (Here Ziyu laments: the power of creation is great indeed, to shape me thus within the great transformation.) His body was bent and hunchbacked, his back covered in sores. Above were the five orifices (his body bent, so the tubes of the five viscera pointed upward), his chin hidden in his navel (his body curved, so his cheeks were concealed below his navel), his shoulders higher than his head, his topknot pointing to the sky (his chin hidden and neck contracted, so his topknot pointed upward). The qi of yin and yang were in disharmony (disharmony means disorder—though his form was received from the transformation of heaven, the disharmony of yin and yang qi caused his body to become so ruined and unbearable). Yet his heart was at ease, untroubled (though his body was ruined, his heart was free of care—this fully shows his ability to find contentment in the Dao, unburdened by his form).\n\nHobbling and dragging himself, he looked into a well (hobbling means leaning for support—fearing his self-knowledge was unclear, he looked into the well and saw his reflection like a shadow) and sighed, “Alas!”\n\nThe Maker of Things would yet again make me thus constrained and bound?\" (Gazing into the well and seeing his own form, he sighed: \"The Maker of Things has already shaped me in this cramped form—must it also make me so ruined and wretched in appearance?\")\n\nZi Si said, \"Do you despise it?\" (Seeing Zi Yu’s sigh, Zi Si asked: \"Do you despise this form?\")\n\nHe replied, \"No, why would I despise it? (No—absolutely not. Zi Yu meant that not only did his heart utterly lack aversion, but he was even transforming along with it.) If the gradual transformation turns my left arm into a rooster, I will thereby seek the cock’s crow at dawn (Gradual transformation refers to the creative process of the Dao. It speaks of moving from formlessness into form, so that if my left arm is transformed into a rooster, I will thereby seek the cock’s crow at dawn); if it turns my right arm into a crossbow pellet, I will thereby seek roasted owl (If my right arm is transformed into a pellet, I will use it to seek roasted owl—hunting owl with the pellet to roast it); if it turns my buttocks into a wheel and my spirit into a horse, I will thereby ride it—why would I need another chariot? (This speaks of the man of the Dao, who regards this body as a boil or sore, not worth observing, and even sees it as a shadow, impossible to grasp. Thus, not only is he unburdened, but he transforms along with it.)\"\n\nThus, one may borrow the illusory to cultivate the real, seeking practical utility through this process. Though this body may be transformed into strange forms, if one can truly master such transformation, both form and spirit become wondrous. The perfected person rides this through the human world—why would they need another chariot?\n\nMoreover, gain comes from timing; loss follows from compliance. Abiding in timing and complying with nature, sorrow and joy cannot enter—this is what the ancients called \"suspended release.\" (The perfected person forgets form to accord with the real, where form and spirit are both wondrous, undisturbed by gain or loss. Abiding in timing and complying with nature, they find contentment in all circumstances, so sorrow and joy cannot enter. This is what the ancients meant by \"suspended release\"—as if the burdens of life were like hanging upside down, transcending life and death to untie the suspension. Hence, it is called \"suspended release.\")\n\nThose who cannot release themselves are bound by things. (All people are originally unburdened and transcendent, naturally suspended and free; yet they cannot achieve this release because they bind themselves.) Moreover, things have long been unable to overcome Heaven—what then should I resent? (People are moved by the transformations of creation, for they cannot overcome Heaven. Since they cannot overcome it, they should simply comply—what is there to resent?)\n\nThis passage speaks of the true person’s true knowledge: form is originally formless, yet once it takes shape, it becomes a burden of life. Thus, the true person regards it as a boil or sore, not to be cherished, or as a shadow, not to be grasped. In this way, they simply follow wherever creation leads, without any thought of gain or loss. Therefore, life and death bring no change to them, and so they abide in timing, comply with nature, and sorrow and joy cannot enter. This is what is meant by \"suspended release.\" From this perspective, all people are originally and naturally liberated, but they torment themselves with the burden of form and ultimately cannot free themselves. This is not Heaven’s fault, but rather people who bind themselves. Moreover, at the boundary between Heaven and humanity, it has long been the case that humanity cannot overcome Heaven. I have seen through this for a long time. Though I possess this borrowed form, I have its true use—what then should I resent?\n\nThis is why they are called true persons, those worthy of reverence and emulation. Soon after, Zilai fell ill, gasping for breath as death approached. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Li went to see him and said, \"Shoo! Away! Do not be startled by transformation!\" Leaning against the doorframe, he spoke to Zilai: \"How wondrous is creation! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you into a mouse’s liver? Or an insect’s limb?\" Zilai replied, \"For a child, parents may send them east or west, north or south, and the child must obey. The forces of yin and yang are no less than parents to a person. If they bring me near death and I do not listen, then I am defiant—what fault is that of creation? The great earth bears me with form, wearies me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well. If a great smith casts metal, and the metal leaps up saying, ‘I must become Moye!’ the smith would surely deem it an inauspicious metal. Now, having merely chanced upon a human form, one says, ‘Human! Human!’ Creation would surely deem this an inauspicious person. If we take Heaven and Earth as a great furnace and creation as a great smith, where could one go and not be acceptable? Falling asleep, waking suddenly—life and death are but dreams and awakenings. Why then cling to or reject, delight in or loathe?\"\n\nThis passage shows that what the true person attains is far beyond the understanding of ordinary men and women, which is why Zili shouted at them to leave. Only those with true knowledge can be called true persons. One must be like Zilai, following transformation and roaming freely, unmoved by life or death, with nothing to cling to in life or resist in death. Only when one reaches such transcendent and singular mastery, pure and flawless, has one fully accomplished the work of learning. This is what it means to be a great master. Above, it was said that the true person can follow life and death, but how does one attain this? The following passage illustrates this through Zisang Hu and his three companions, who are those beyond the world who have attained the Way. This is the fruit of learning, not something those confined to conventional paths could understand.\n\nZisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Ziqin Zhang became friends, saying to one another, \"Who can join together in non-joining, act together in non-acting? Who can ascend to Heaven, roam in the mists, and wander boundlessly? Who can forget life while living, with no end or limit?\" The three looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord. Thus, they became friends.\n\nAfter a brief while, Zisang Hu died, and before he was buried, Confucius heard of it and sent Zigong to attend to the funeral rites. Some wove cords, others played the zither, and together they sang in harmony: \"Alas, Zisang Hu! Alas, Zisang Hu!\"\n\nYet you have already returned to your true nature, while I still remain a mere human—alas!\" Zigong hastened forward and said, \"May I ask: is it proper to sing before the corpse?\" The two looked at each other and smiled, saying, \"How could he understand the meaning of ritual?\"\n\nZigong returned and reported to Confucius: \"What manner of men are they? Their conduct is without refinement, they treat the body as external, and when singing before the corpse, their countenance showed no change. I cannot name them—what manner of men are they?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"They wander beyond the bounds of the world, while I wander within them. The outer and inner do not meet, and my sending you to offer condolences was indeed a vulgar error. They now assist the Creator in shaping humanity, roaming as one with the single qi of Heaven and Earth. To them, life is but an excrescence or hanging tumor, and death the bursting of a boil or the draining of an abscess. How could such as they know the sequence of life and death? Borrowing from strange elements, they lodge in a shared body, forgetting their liver and gall, neglecting their ears and eyes. They cycle through beginnings and ends, unaware of any boundary. Vaguely they wander beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action. How could they trouble themselves with the rituals of the vulgar world to display themselves before the eyes and ears of the multitude?\"\n\nZigong said, \"Then to what realm does the Master adhere?\"\nConfucius said, \"I am one punished by Heaven. My bonds remain unsevered—I am still bound by the fetters of the world.\"\n\nThough this be so, I share it with you—though I have not transcended, I am no different from you, and now I shall wander with you beyond the bounds.\"\n\nZigong said, \"May I ask the way to such a realm?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Fish are made for water, as humans are made for the Dao. Those made for water dig ponds to sustain themselves; those made for the Dao find stillness without effort. Thus it is said: fish forget one another in rivers and lakes, just as humans forget one another in the arts of the Dao. To dig a pond and tend to fish is still to labor; to be made for the Dao is to let go and find ease. Hence, without doing, one attains stillness.\"\n\nZigong said, \"May I ask about the *qi*-person?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"The *qi*-person is one who stands apart from others yet moves in harmony with Heaven. Thus it is said: what is a petty man in Heaven’s eyes is a noble man among men; what is a noble man among men is a petty man in Heaven’s eyes. The *qi*-person, though apart from the world, aligns with Heaven. The self-righteous gentleman, bound by his own constraints, cannot roam freely—he may be a noble man among men, yet in Heaven’s eyes, he remains small, for he has not merged with the Way.\"\n\nThis passage shows that even Confucius, a sage within the bounds of the world, could guide others toward the learning of the boundless. It suggests that even those who cling rigidly to conventions may yet be led to the great Dao. If Zigong, with all his wisdom, still stands far from the Way, how much more so others? Below, the text clarifies that the Way of the boundless is not beyond the reach of those within the bounds—only the vulgar fail to recognize it. Thus, it invokes Yan Hui to illustrate the point, as Confucius sought to dispel his confusion. For one like Yan Hui, who loved learning, true mastery and self-realization were indeed within grasp.\n\nYan Hui asked Confucius, \"Mengsun Cai, when his mother died, wept without tears, felt no grief in his heart, and showed no sorrow in mourning. Lacking these three, he yet won fame throughout Lu for his mastery of mourning rites. How could one gain such renown without substance to match it?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Mengsun Cai fulfilled the rites to perfection—he had advanced beyond mere knowledge. Most know only the rituals of the world, but Mengsun had grasped the truth of Heaven. To return to the root is the essence of ritual. He sought to simplify mourning but could not, for custom demands grief. Thus, though he wept, he did so without true sorrow—he had already cast off much of the burden.\n\nMengsun did not know why he lived or why he died. He did not cling to what came before or what came after. Having awakened to the truth of neither birth nor death, he moved through life as if unborn and faced death as if undying. He saw himself as but a thing in the great transformation, awaiting the change he could not know. For how could one who is about to transform know that he will not? And how could one who resists transformation know that he has not already changed?\n\nYou and I are but dreamers who have yet to awaken. He was startled by the form but untouched in spirit—like a piglet fleeing at the sight of its dead mother, yet its nature remained unshaken. His life was but a morning, his body a dwelling; though the form dissolved, the true master endured. Thus, there was a dwelling but no true death. Mengsun alone had awakened to this truth. He wept as others wept, yet his heart was not in it.\"\n\nMoreover, in this we are as one—what is mine is yours. For once one knows that death is not death, then seeing Mengzi’s mother who has died is no different from seeing Mengsun who has not. Thus, in comparing them, we are as one—seeing them as a single body.\n\nHow could you possibly understand what I mean by \"what is mine\"? The principle of life and death as a single thread—how could ordinary people comprehend this meaning of \"what is mine\"?\n\nLet me ask you this: if you dream of being a bird, you soar to the heavens; if you dream of being a fish, you plunge into the depths. Yet the bird and fish in the dream are no different from Yan Hui when awake. This is what I mean by \"what is mine.\"\n\nNow, is the one speaking to me now awake—or still dreaming? If you say it is Yan Hui, then you have already transformed into bird or fish. If you say it is bird or fish, you may yet appear as the unchanged Yan Hui. Examine for yourself this principle of life and death as a single thread—is it not precisely so? These words are most wondrous, yet most difficult to grasp.\n\nSeeking harmony, laughter does not follow (for when harmony reaches its perfect pitch, even laughter cannot keep pace); offering laughter, jest cannot keep up (as when one jests to provoke laughter, the moment of mirth arrives before one can clap in response). To arrange and then dissolve—only then does one enter the vast and singular sky of Dao (this \"vast and singular sky\" is the boundless, undifferentiated heaven of the Great Dao. At first, one’s efforts in Dao cultivation are deliberate, like an arrangement; but when purity is attained and the realm of great transformation is reached, sudden awakening occurs naturally, without contrivance, and one enters of itself).\n\nThis passage speaks of learning beyond the mundane—though even within the world, some may achieve it. Yet amid worldly customs, ordinary minds cannot recognize it; only a true person can truly know. Thus, the Master borrows Yan Hui to awaken the sage. Here lies the most awakening and earnest truth for the world.\n\nThe above speaks of transcending life and death as the ultimate attainment of Dao, which hinges on sudden enlightenment. Below, it says that if one wishes to learn the Dao, one must first cast aside all matters of benevolence and righteousness, reverence and self-importance, wisdom and skill, and long-ingrained habits—only then can one enter the Dao.\n\nYi’erzi went to see Xu You. Xu You asked, “How has Yao instructed you?” Yi’erzi replied, “Yao told me: ‘You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness and clearly distinguish right from wrong.’” Xu You said, “Then why have you come here? (Why have you come at all? This implies you have already been corrupted by Yao’s teachings.) Yao has branded you with benevolence and righteousness (meaning he has marred your original nature with artificial virtue) and mutilated you with right and wrong. How then will you wander in the boundless and carefree realm of transformation?” Yi’erzi said, “Though I cannot enter the depths of the Great Dao, I still wish to wander near its fence.” Xu You said, “Not so. The blind cannot appreciate the beauty of brows and eyes, nor the colorblind discern the patterns of blue and yellow embroidery (meaning your mind is already blind and colorblind, making the Great Dao inaccessible).” Yi’erzi replied, “Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, Ju Liang lost his strength, and the Yellow Emperor forgot his wisdom (speaking of how the perfect person’s skill in saving others can make each lose what they once possessed)—all within the crucible of transformation. How do I know that the Creator will not cease my branding and mend my mutilation, allowing me to ride upon completion and follow you, Master?” Xu You said, “Alas! It cannot yet be known. Let me tell you the general outline (not daring to reveal its full depth, I will speak only of its broad strokes): My teacher! My teacher! (My teacher is the Great Master, beyond comparison with Yao.) He grinds all things to dust yet does not call it righteousness; his blessings extend through ten thousand generations yet he does not call it benevolence (Yao tirelessly promotes benevolence and righteousness, taking the nurturing of all things as his achievement. But the Great Master grinds all things to powder without considering it righteousness, bestows blessings through ten thousand generations without considering it benevolence. In great benevolence, there is no benevolence; in great righteousness, there is no righteousness—this is the meaning of Laozi’s ‘giving life without possessing, acting without relying, growing without dominating’). He is older than high antiquity yet does not call it age; he covers and bears heaven and earth, carves and shapes all forms yet does not call it skill (the Great Dao gave birth to heaven and earth, nurtured all things without intention, thus not claiming any skill). This is the realm in which he wanders!”\n\nThis passage teaches that to learn the Great Dao, one must cast aside all deliberate striving for benevolence, righteousness, reverence, self-importance, wisdom, and skill—only then can one transcend the mysterious and enter the wondrous, wandering freely in the realm of the Great Dao. For benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, and skill are but the tools of fame and gain, the pursuits of the worldly, and true obstacles to the Great Dao.\n\nYan Hui said, “I have made progress.” Confucius asked, “What do you mean?” He replied, “I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness!” Confucius said, “Good, but not yet enough.” Another day, he saw Confucius again and said, “I have made progress.” Confucius asked, “What do you mean?” He replied, “I have forgotten ritual and music!” Confucius said, “Good, but not yet enough.” Another day, he saw Confucius again and said, “I have made progress!” Confucius asked, “What do you mean?”\n\nHui replied, “I have attained *zuowang*—sitting in forgetfulness.”\nConfucius, his countenance shifting, asked, “What do you mean by *zuowang*?”\nYan Hui said, “I dissolve (*hui*) my limbs and body (forgetting form), cast off (*chu*) my hearing and sight (erasing knowledge and perception), detach from form and abandon knowledge, and merge with the Great Thoroughfare (*datong*—where self and things are both forgotten, vast and empty, inner and outer as one). This is called *zuowang*.”\nConfucius said, “When merged, there are no preferences (for when self and world are both forgotten, things and I are both empty, all inclinations of acceptance and rejection vanish, hence nothing is favored); when transformed, there is no constancy (for when things and I are both forgotten, form and spirit are wholly transformed—transformed, there is no self, and nothing is not oneself. Thus, one does not cling to the self as constant). Truly (*guo*), you surpass me in virtue! I, Qiu, would follow after you.”\n\nThis passage shows that even those scholars confined to the mundane and partial learning, if they can diminish and forget themselves entirely to merge with the great Dao, will be deferred to even by sages and the wise. It means that such attainment cannot be entered through cleverness or skill. Thus, earlier, Zigong’s ignorance was noted, while now, only Yan Hui can enter.\n\nZiyu and Zisang were friends. After ten days of ceaseless rain, Ziyu said, “Zisang must be suffering (knowing he had nothing to eat)!” He wrapped rice and went to feed him. Arriving at Zisang’s gate, he heard something between singing and weeping (a mournful song), as Zisang plucked his zither and sang:\n*“Father! Mother! Heaven! Man!”*\nHis voice could not sustain the melody (weak from hunger, his voice failed), and he hurriedly recited his verse (breath short and disjointed, the words of the poem broken by gasps).\nZiyu entered and asked, “Why do you sing like this (why is your song so unmelodic)?”\nZisang replied, “I pondered who has brought me to this extremity, but I cannot find the answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers all without partiality; earth bears all without favor. Would heaven and earth single me out for poverty? I sought the cause, but it cannot be found! Yet to reach this extremity—it is fate (*ming*)!”\n\nThis passage concludes the chapter’s meaning. Yet the chapter discusses the Great Master, so why does it end with *ming*? It reveals this old man’s lifelong heart-matter, too profound for words. He means: I am one who embodies the great Dao, fit to be the great master of all ages. Yet born in this world, I am unknown to others and live in utter poverty and hardship—does heaven intend this for me? Yet being unrecognized in my time—it is fate. In this single phrase, boundless meaning is contained.\n\nYet this Great Master is none other than the Perfected One, the Spirit-Man, and the Sage of the \"Free and Easy Wandering\"—their \"not-knowing as knowing\" is the true knowledge of the \"Equalizing Things,\" the true governor, the master of nurturing life. All the figures in this chapter embody virtue in full measure. These meanings converge in the Great Master, completing the teaching of inner sageliness.\n\nThe following \"Responding to Emperors and Kings\" expresses the intent of outer kingship. In Zhuangzi’s thought, inner sageliness and outer kingship form the substance and function. The Perfected One, the Spirit-Man, and the Sage of the earlier \"Free and Easy Wandering\" are precisely what is meant here by the Great Master. Moreover, it is said that with mere dust, chaff, and husks, one may yet mold and forge a Yao or Shun. Thus it is said: the true Dao is for cultivating the self; its leftover scraps and dregs may be used for the world and the state. Governing the world is but the Sage’s incidental task.\n\nThe first six chapters expound the wonders of the great Dao, while the Great Master is one who has attained the Dao—this is the Sage’s complete embodiment, already realized within oneself. Where there is substance, there must be function; hence \"Responding to Emperors and Kings\" reveals the function of the great Dao. If the Sage’s time and fortune are about to emerge, compelled by necessity to answer the mandate, then he becomes a sagely emperor or enlightened king. Extending its leftover threads, he transforms through non-action, utterly free from deliberate effort or contrivance. This manifests the great function of non-action, and thus the chapter is so named.\n\nNie Que asked Wang Ni four questions, and four times received the answer \"I do not know\" (this chapter takes \"not-knowing\" as its key; this not-knowing is a heart unmoved by the world, indifferent and serene). Nie Que leapt with great joy and went to tell Pu Yi Zi. Pu Yi Zi said: \"Have you only now come to know this?\" (Do you only now realize the wonder of not-knowing?) The Lord of Yu does not compare to the Lord of Tai (hitherto, the world has known only the Lord of Yu as a Sage, unaware that he does not match the Lord of Tai).\n\nThe Lord of Yu still harbors virtue to entice others (this speaks of the Lord of Yu’s inadequacy. For he takes benevolence as goodness and thus deliberately uses benevolence to bind others’ hearts). Though he may win people, he has never emerged from the realm of the unperfected (the Lord of Yu, using benevolence to entice others, may win them, yet cannot forget his merit and fame—this remains a worldly practice, unable to transcend the human realm and awaken to the wonder of the true person’s Dao, thus attaining the state beyond the human).\n\nThe Lord of Tai, in repose, is leisurely and at ease (leisurely, unhurried, and carefree); in waking, he is content and self-possessed. Now he takes himself as a horse, now as an ox. His knowledge is genuine and trustworthy; his virtue is utterly true, yet he has never entered the realm of the unperfected (this speaks of the Lord of Tai’s transcendence over the Lord of Yu: emptying his heart to wander through the world, his mind at ease and self-content, forgetting both self and others. If people deceive him as an ox, he responds as an ox; if they call him a horse, he responds as a horse. Never clinging to his own views, he moves with all things. His knowledge is not delusion but awakening to the true nature of things).\n\nThe term \"genuine and trustworthy\" refers to the essence of the Dao. As previously stated, \"possessing genuineness and trustworthiness\" describes this essence. When its virtue and function are utterly true, they are not tainted by human artifice. Thus, one transcends mundane sentiments, abides in the realm beyond the human of the great Dao, yet does not fall into mere emptiness. Moreover, one harmonizes with the world’s dust and radiance without ever confining oneself to narrow self-restraint. Such is the marvel of the Lord of Tai. For he has grasped the essence of the great master, and in engaging with the world, merely extends its residual threads to deliver all beings. Hence it is said he has never entered the realm of the unperfected.\n\nJian Wu met the madman Jie Yu. Jie Yu asked, \"What did Ri Zhongshi tell you?\" Jian Wu replied, \"He told me that a ruler of men issues constant laws as standards and measures, employing rightness to regulate the people. Who would dare not listen and be transformed?\" Jie Yu said, \"This is deceptive virtue. If a ruler relies on his own ability to govern and deceives the people into compliance, it is as futile as crossing the sea to dig a river or commanding a mosquito to bear a mountain. The governance of the sage does not consist in external control. Only after rectifying himself does he act, enabling each to rectify their own nature. As Laozi said, 'In clarity and stillness, he rectifies all under heaven.' Truly, each is capable of their own affairs. Human nature is originally endowed by the great Dao, complete and self-sufficient, with no need for the slightest human intervention. If only each awakens to their true nature, they will naturally transform through tranquility and non-action—what need is there for deliberate effort?\"\n\nMoreover, birds soar high to evade the harm of arrows and nets, while moles burrow deep beneath the sacred mounds of the earth altars to escape the peril of fumigation and excavation. Yet are these two creatures truly without awareness? Birds and moles, by their inborn nature, act as they must; it is only human cunning that seeks to capture them, compelling them to flee aloft or hide below. How then can one claim these creatures lack understanding? The people’s nature is like that of birds and moles—if a ruler governs with deliberate intent, can they not but be startled and take flight?\n\nThe *Outer Chapters*’ \"Horse’s Hooves\" vividly illustrates this point. These two passages argue that governing the world cannot be achieved through deliberate effort, reliance on knowledge, or self-aggrandizement. If one instead embraces non-action, the people will naturally transform. As Laozi said, *\"I practice non-action, and the people transform of themselves\"* and *\"In clarity and stillness, he rectifies all under heaven.\"* If one imposes laws to control the people, they will not only resist but, like birds and moles, be alarmed and flee.\n\nTian Gen was wandering in Yin Yang when he reached the banks of the Liao River. There, he encountered an unnamed man and asked, *\"May I inquire how to govern the world?\"* The unnamed man replied, *\"Away with you! You are a crude man—why do you ask so hastily? I am about to become human through the Creator (abiding by the transformations of nature, not acting with worldly intent). If I grow weary, I shall ride the boundless bird of the Dao, soaring beyond the six directions to wander in the realm of Nothingness, the vast and limitless wilds. Why should governing the world trouble my heart?\"*\n\nTian Gen pressed further, and the unnamed man said, *\"Let your mind wander in stillness, harmonize your qi with emptiness, follow the natural course of things without imposing private designs, and the world will be governed. Only thus will all under heaven be well-ordered.\"* This passage directly reveals the subtlety of governing through non-action, urging rulers to emulate the effortless transformation of high antiquity.\n\nYang Ziju visited Lao Dan and said, *\"Suppose there were a man here who, in his eagerness to pursue the Dao, is swift and resolute, penetrating and clear-minded in all matters, and tireless in his studies—could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?\"* Lao Dan replied, *\"Such a man, when measured against a sage, is like a convict laboring in shifts, a craftsman bound to his trade, or a merchant shackled to the marketplace—his body toils and his heart trembles. A man so swift and resolute is like those forced laborers, endlessly occupied, his body and mind exhausted. How could such a one govern the people? Moreover, the patterns on tigers and leopards invite hunting; the agility of apes and the skill of hunting dogs bring them to be tethered. If such a man could be compared to an enlightened king, then apes and hunting dogs could be as well.\"*\n\nYang Ziju, his expression changing, asked, *\"Then may I inquire how an enlightened king governs?\"* Lao Dan said, *\"The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover all under heaven, yet he does not claim them as his own; he bestows transformation upon the myriad things, yet the people do not rely on him. His merit is too vast to be named, and he allows each thing to delight in itself, as if to say, ‘What has the ruler’s power to do with me?’ He stands in the unfathomable and wanders in the realm of Nothingness—this is the essence of Laozi’s ‘acting without presuming’ and ‘not asserting dominion.’\"*\n\nThis passage expounds upon the governance of an enlightened king, further clarifying Laozi’s intent to reveal the foundational principles of his teachings. It extols the Great Master, who manifests in the world as a sagely emperor or enlightened king, enacting the transformative power of non-action. Above, it was said that the enlightened king \"stands in the unfathomable and wanders in the realm of Nothingness\"—only thus can he respond to the world and govern all under heaven. Yet what is this \"unfathomable\" realm, and can one learn to attain it?\n\nThus, below, Master Huzǐ is introduced as a man of the unfathomable, and what he reveals to the spirit-diviner exemplifies the unfathomable state. When Liezi witnessed this, he desired to learn, for he was such a person.\n\nIn the state of Zheng, there was a spirit-diviner named Ji Xian, who could discern a person’s life and death, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early demise—predicting the year, month, or even the day with divine accuracy. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled in fear, dreading his revelations of ill fate. Liezi, however, was entranced upon meeting him and, returning home, told Huzǐ, his master: *\"At first, I believed your Way to be supreme, yet now I see there is something even greater.\"*\n\nHuzǐ replied: *\"What I have taught you is merely the outward form, not yet the true essence. Do you truly believe you have attained the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs? Just as creatures require both male and female to reproduce, so too do people’s fortunes arise from the interplay of opposing forces. If the mind could transcend such duality, how could a diviner read your fate? Yet you, in your eagerness to prove your mastery of the Dao, compete with the world, seeking validation. Thus, others can read you. Come tomorrow and bring him to me—let him observe me.\"*\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to meet Huzǐ. Afterward, the diviner emerged and said to Liezi in astonishment: *\"Alas! Your master is already dead! He cannot live! He will not last ten days! I saw something strange—his face was like damp ashes, utterly devoid of life.\"*\n\nLiezi entered, his tears soaking his robe, and told Huzǐ what he had heard. Huzǐ said: *\"Earlier, I showed him the ‘earthly pattern’—the state of stillness grounded in the most tranquil realm. Like a seed yet to sprout, it neither stirs nor manifests. This is akin to the Buddhist practice of *śamatha-vipaśyanā*, the method of calming the mind. The ‘earthly pattern’ is the mind settled in perfect stillness, where not a single thought arises, nor any movement or display. All mental activity is extinguished, which is why his face appeared like damp ashes, lifeless. He mistook my cessation of vital energy for death. Bring him again tomorrow.\"*\n\nThe following day, Liezi once more brought Ji Xian to see Huzǐ.\n\nHe emerged and said to Liezi: *\"How fortunate! Your master has met me—he will recover! He is fully alive again! I saw his suspended animation return to movement!\"*\n\nLiezi entered and reported this to Huzǐ. Huzǐ said: *\"Earlier, I showed him the ‘Heaven-and-Earth’—the realm of luminous clarity, where names and forms do not enter. Yet the mechanism arose from the very depths. This is akin to the practice of *śamatha-vipaśyanā* emerging from perfect stillness. He likely saw my most excellent mechanism.\"*\n\n*\"Bring him again tomorrow.\"*\n\nThe next day, Liezi once more brought Ji Xian to see Huzǐ. Ji Xian emerged and said to Liezi: *\"Your master is unsettled—his spirit wanders, his complexion shifts. I cannot read him. Let him compose himself, and I will observe him again.\"*\n\nLiezi entered and told Huzǐ. Huzǐ said: *\"Earlier, I showed him the ‘Great Thoroughfare’—the state of supreme emptiness where nothing prevails. This is the non-duality of movement and stillness, the simultaneous operation of *śamatha* and *vipaśyanā*, the undivided realm. He likely saw my balanced qi-mechanism.\"*\n\n*\"The loach coils in the deep mud—this is the abyss of stillness. Still water is the abyss of clarity, reflecting all things. Flowing water is the abyss of constancy, its nature undisturbed by movement. The abyss has nine forms; I have shown him three. Bring him again tomorrow.\"*\n\nThe following day, Liezi once more brought Ji Xian to see Huzǐ. Before he could settle, Ji Xian lost himself and fled. Huzǐ said: *\"Pursue him!\"* Liezi chased him but could not catch up. He returned and reported to Huzǐ: *\"He has vanished! He is gone! I could not reach him!\"*\n\nHuzǐ said: *\"Earlier, I showed him what has never departed from my root—Dao’s primordial source. I abided in utter emptiness, adapting to his presence like a shadow, yet he knew not who or what I was. He took me for drifting grass, for a surging wave—hence his flight.\"*\n\nThereafter, Liezi realized he had never truly learned. He returned home and did not emerge for three years. He cooked for his wife, fed the pigs as he would feed people, and no longer clung to affairs. Carved and polished, he returned to simplicity, standing alone like an unhewn block. Though enmeshed in the boundaries of form, he remained thus to the end.\n\nThis passage illustrates how the enlightened ruler abides in the unfathomable, transforming through non-action. Zhuangzi feared that people would not grasp what the unfathomable truly is, nor what manner of person embodies it.\n\nThus, he specially presented Master Huzi as the embodiment of such a person, and what was revealed to the spirit-diviner exemplified the unfathomable realm. Only one who abides in such a state of mind can engage with the world, be called an enlightened ruler, and transform through non-action—how could others even approximate this? Such false learning may be cultivated to attainment, but only if one truly believes and puts it into practice. Liezi was one who aspired to and trusted in the Dao. This exhortation to the world defies description.\n\nThe above speaks of Huzi merely to illustrate the unfathomable realm. What follows further elaborates on its application in engaging with the world:\n\nDo not be the steward of fame (for *shi* means \"to preside\"; the true person must first forget fame, hence the warning against becoming its steward). Do not be the repository of schemes (for *moufu* denotes the gathering place of cunning plans; one must act without intention, not making strategy one’s concern). Do not take on affairs as a burden (one must not forcibly assume responsibilities, for to bear them is to invite trouble; rather, respond to matters as if they arose from another). Do not make knowledge your master (for *zhizhu* means to take cleverness as one’s guide; one must follow things with a forgetful heart, not letting wit dominate).\n\nEmbody the boundless (to *ti* is to realize the great Dao, responding and transforming without end) and wander without trace (for *zhen* means \"sign\"; to wander in the origin of nothingness is to rest the mind where not a single thought arises). Fully enact what you have received from Heaven, yet perceive no gain (merely fulfill what Heaven has bestowed, preserving the whole without loss, and without any sense of attainment)—this is but emptiness (thus it returns to emptiness alone, with not the slightest addition).\n\nThe mind of the perfected person acts like a mirror: it neither anticipates nor welcomes, responds without retention, and thus can master things without harm (the perfected person’s mind is like a bright mirror, reflecting whatever comes before it without premeditation or anticipation. When things arrive, beauty and ugliness are clearly seen, yet no trace of them is retained, and no judgment of right or wrong remains. Responding to the world with such emptiness, one can master things, and nothing can ultimately harm them—for this is the perfection of emptiness).\n\nAll the preceding descriptions of the true person’s many states and practices culminate in the twenty-two characters from \"the perfected person\" onward. Herein lies the entirety of Zhuangzi’s learning, effort, efficacy, and application. All else he presents is but elaboration. The meaning of the Inner Chapters is fully contained here. For scholars seeking realization, there is no need for more—merely begin with these few words, and one may respond to things with a forgetful heart, reaping boundless benefit for a lifetime. This is what is called \"free and easy wandering.\"\n\nThe Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Central Realm was Hundun. Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s territory, and Hundun treated them very well. They conspired to repay his kindness, saying, “All people have seven apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only he has none. Let us try to bore them for him.” Each day they chiseled one aperture, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.\n\n(Shu and Hu represent the sudden arising of existence from nothingness—the moment when, at the beginning of the great transformation, one first receives form. Hundun signifies the state shortly after form appears, when consciousness and perception are still absent, a time of undifferentiated, unknowing simplicity. As the apertures of perception are daily chiseled open and knowledge awakens, primordial integrity is lost—hence the saying, “Each day they chiseled one aperture, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.” Some commentators associate Shu with fire, Hu with water, and Hundun with earth, which seems plausible but risks over-interpretation. The present explanation suffices.)\n\nThis chapter on Shu and Hu not only concludes the “Fit for Emperors and Kings” but in fact encapsulates the central meaning of all seven Inner Chapters. The earlier discussion of “free and easy wandering” ultimately returns to the “Great and Venerable Teacher.” The repeated references to petty knowledge harming life, to nourishing form while forgetting life’s essence, to being harmed by things—all these failures to attain freedom stem from the error of knowledge and cleverness. They all result from the chiseling open of Hundun and the loss of primordial integrity. Indeed, from ancient times to the present, in the vast expanse between heaven and earth, not a single person since Yao and Shun has avoided being one who chisels open Hundun. This is but a parable for the fact that all people in the world are deluded and ignorant, universally so. To the common eye, it may seem absurd, yet not a word of it fails to express a heart of salvation and compassion for the lost. How could one regard it merely as literature? The reader must perceive its intent.\n\nEven this interpretation is not forced or contrived, for it follows the text’s own principles to grasp its authorial purpose. If one cross-references it with the *zhiguan* of the human and heavenly vehicles in Buddhist teachings—as the *Zongjing lu* also states—what Laozi and Zhuangzi espoused as the Dao of natural purity and non-action corresponds to the luminous meditation of the first dhyāna heaven. May my fellow practitioners not mistakenly assume that I am improperly equating it with Buddhism.",

      "translated_text": "The *Annotations on the Inner Chapters of Zhuangzi*\n*By Kuanglu Yisou of the Ming Dynasty; Commentary by Hanshan Shi Deqing*\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* is a commentary and exegesis on the *Laozi*. I have often said that Zhuangzi’s relation to Laozi is like Mencius’s to Confucius. If one fully awakens to the Dao of Laozi and then reads this book, one sees that it emerges entirely from transformations within that Dao. Yet because its author possessed vast talent and expansive eloquence, his words surge and flow with unrestrained freedom—so much so that readers grasp at them like chasing the wind or clutching at shadows. Only by thoroughly perceiving the intent behind his words can one avoid being deceived by them.\n\nThe entire work consists of thirty-three chapters, but the seven inner chapters alone exhaust its meaning; the outer chapters are merely elaborations and embellishments. If scholars penetrate the inner chapters with precision, they will attain boundless joy and cease to be ordinary worldly people.\n\nThe origins and influences of its learning, as well as the elucidation of its theories, have already been thoroughly expounded. I urge you to study them carefully.\n\n**Volume One: \"Free and Easy Wandering\"**\nThis is the first chapter of the book. Zhuangzi himself said: \"Words have their source; affairs have their ruler.\" This is precisely the foundational principle of his discourse.\n\n\"Free and easy\" (*xiaoyaoyou*) conveys the meaning of vastness and unconstrained freedom, akin to the \"unobstructed liberation\" (*apratihatā-vimokṣa*) in Buddhist scriptures. The Buddha attains liberation by severing all afflictions, while Zhuangzi achieves it by transcending the physical form, dissolving cunning and knowledge, and not being burdened by the pursuit of fame and achievement for the sake of one’s own life. He points to the void and the natural as the homeland of the Great Dao, the realm of *xiaoyaoyou*—as seen in later phrases like \"the land of nothing whatsoever\" (*wuheyou zhi xiang*) and \"the vast and boundless wilds\" (*guangmo zhi ye*). This implies that only the true person (*zhenren*) can wander in this vast and unconstrained expanse—namely, the \"Great Master\" (*dazongshi*) referred to below.\n\nOrdinary people fail to attain such freedom because they are shackled by the notion of the self (*wo*). Thus, all their actions are directed toward their own lives, seeking merit and fame. From ancient times to the present, the entire world has been tormented by these three concerns throughout their lives—when have they ever experienced a moment of true joy? Only the great sages, having forgotten these three things, attain boundless freedom and unconstrained delight.\n\nHow pitiful are worldly people, so deluded and confined, acting only for the sake of their own selves! Their vision is narrow, and not only do they fail to comprehend the wonder of the Great Dao, but even when it is spoken of, they do not believe it—just as the text says, \"lesser knowledge does not reach greater knowledge\" (*xiao zhi bu ji da zhi*), which expresses this idea.\n\nThe central intent of this chapter is to establish the framework of \"the perfected person (*zhiren*) has no self, the sage (*shengren*) has no merit, the spirit-like person (*shenren*) has no fame.\" This guiding principle is only fully revealed at the end, demonstrating the transformative and exhilarating nature of his prose. If scholars grasp the foundational intent of his words, the essence of the entire book will become clear.",

      "translated_text": "In the Northern Darkness (for the Northern Sea is the abyss of the Dark and Mysterious), there is a fish—its name is Kun. The Kun is so vast that none know how many thousand *li* it spans. It transforms into a bird—its name is Peng. The Peng’s back is so broad that none know how many thousand *li* it measures; when it rouses itself to flight, its wings hang like clouds draped across the sky. This bird, when the sea surges, will journey to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond.\n\nZhuangzi declares that in his words, \"ninety percent are parables, seventy percent are reiterations, and his impromptu speech flows daily, harmonizing with the natural grain of things.\" The entire book’s discourse does not stray from these three forms. The Kun and Peng, for instance, are parables—employing things to convey meaning, to illuminate the Dao, as in what is called analogy. The intent of this passage on \"free and easy wandering\" (*xiaoyaoyou*) is simply to depict the sage who has attained vastness and transformation. Only the sage achieves true freedom. Thus, he fashions the Kun and Peng to illustrate the meaning of \"vastness and transformation.\"\n\nThe Northern Darkness is the Northern Sea, a remote and unseen place, symbolizing the profound and obscure Great Dao. The Kun within the sea represents the embryo of the great sage nurtured within the body of the Dao. Just as the vast Kun could only be reared in the boundless Northern Sea, so too the sage’s potential is cultivated within the vastness of the Dao. The Kun’s transformation into the Peng directly symbolizes the sage who has attained \"vastness and transformation.\" Yet though the Kun is immense, it remains but a single inert thing—who would recognize its greatness? Only when it transforms into the Peng does its vastness become apparent. The Peng’s wings, like clouds hanging from the sky, make its magnitude even more evident than the Kun’s immensity in the sea.\n\n\"Rousing itself to flight\" describes how the Peng’s vastness makes flight no easy feat; it must muster its entire strength to take wing. This mirrors the sage, who, though possessing the fullness of the Dao, lies submerged in the profound stillness of the abyss, its power dormant. Only by exerting the full force of the Dao can it emerge from stillness into activity—just as the Peng must rouse itself to fly. Once the sage appears, its wings shelter all living things, hence the analogy of the bird’s wings like clouds draped across the sky—a magnitude beyond comparison with the Kun.\n\n\"When the sea surges\" refers to the movement of the sea’s *qi*, symbolizing how the sage emerges into the world borne by the great tide of *qi*—no ordinary occurrence. \"Will journey\" means to migrate. The Southern Darkness, akin to the Southern Light, signifies the direction of yang brightness, a metaphor for the sovereign who faces south. It suggests that when the sage responds to the turning of the times and appears in the world, they become a sagely emperor or enlightened king, facing south to govern all under heaven. The later chapter \"The Great and Venerable Teacher\" speaks of this same sage as \"responding to the emperor and king,\" embodying the intent of migrating to the Southern Darkness. This is what is meant by \"words having a source, affairs having a lord.\"\n\n*Qi Xie* is a record of anomalies. It states: \"When the Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, it beats the water for three thousand *li*, spirals upward on the whirlwind for ninety thousand *li*, and departs on the sixth-month gale.\" Zhuangzi’s intent is that the tale of the Kun and Peng’s transformation may seem fantastical, risking disbelief. Thus, he cites this as evidence, declaring that his account is not mere idle talk but something he found in *Qi Xie*. One might ask: What sort of book is *Qi Xie*? It is a record of strange and wondrous events. Hence, it states: \"When the Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, it beats the water for three thousand *li*.\" Its wings strike the sea, churning the waves for three thousand *li*—its vastness is thus revealed. The \"whirlwind\" is a great wind. Beating its wings against this wind, it soars upward ninety thousand *li* in a single ascent—its magnitude is further confirmed. The \"sixth month\" refers to the sixth month of the Zhou calendar, the fourth month of summer, when yang energy flourishes, and the winds grow strong and forceful, enabling the Peng to lift its wings. \"Gale\" here means wind, likening the winds of heaven and earth to the breath within the human body.\n\nThis passage is where his brushwork stirs with exhilaration, and with this evidence, his words become credible. \"The wild horses of the plains, the dust motes—all living things are blown about by the breath.\" Is the deep blue of the sky its true color? Or is it so distant that it has no end? When one looks down from above, it appears no different. This speaks to the meaning of vastness upon vastness.",

      "translated_text": "The \"wild horses\" are the mirages of the marshlands, insubstantial things. The \"dust motes\" are the floating specks in the air, illuminated by sunlight streaming through crevices. \"Living things blown about by the breath\" refers to the birds and insects of the world. \"Blown about by the breath\" speaks to the subtlety of qi. The deep blue of the sky is not its true color, but rather the boundless expanse of the great void, where the eye’s power fails to reach. This suggests that the Peng bird’s magnitude may indeed be called great, yet when viewed from the vastness of the great void above, it appears no different from the wild horses or dust motes—how minute it seems! Even the mighty winds of the whirlwind that stir it are but like the breath that blows and puffs among living things—what greatness is there in that? Thus it is said: \"When one looks down from above, it appears no different.\" This implies that even the greatness of the sage, though vast, remains bound by form and still possesses shape and structure. Yet the formless, nameless great Dao transcends all such limitations—what comparison could there be? This is to say that the sage’s freedom comes from the Dao, not from form.\n\nMoreover, if water does not accumulate in great depth, it lacks the strength to bear a great boat. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the ground, and a mustard seed may serve as a boat; but place a cup there, and it will stick fast—for the water is shallow and the boat too large. If wind does not accumulate in great depth, it lacks the strength to bear great wings. Thus, only when the wind lies beneath at ninety thousand *li* can the Peng rise aloft (for the wind must be below and the wings above, lifting and bearing it, so that it may soar far). Only then does it ride the wind, its back bearing the blue sky, with nothing to obstruct or hinder its path (no midway collapse or stagnation). Only then does it dare to plan its journey south. This passage summarizes the transformation of the Kun into the Peng and its southward flight, subtly likening it to the great sage, who must cultivate deeply and amass profoundly before being put to use. It means that if the waters of the northern sea are not deep, they cannot nurture the great Kun; and even when the Kun transforms into the Peng, without the great wind to lift and bear it, it cannot reach the southern darkness. This is like saying that without the profound and vast depths of the great Dao, it cannot nurture the embryo of the great sage; even if the great form is cultivated, without transformation, it cannot achieve great use; and even with the sage’s power, without the great momentum of a flourishing world, it cannot emerge in response to the times to accomplish its vast and luminous work. Only by deep cultivation and awaiting the right moment can the full potential of the great sage be realized. Thus, the text speaks of water and wind to illustrate the need for profound accumulation. Yet the accumulation of water originally refers to the Kun. Here, instead of speaking of nurturing fish, the text shifts to bearing boats—this is a transformation in the writing, making it elusive. Had it remained fixed on the Kun, the prose would have been stiff and clumsy. The intent is to mock those of shallow learning, who lack deep virtue and yet dare to speak of great achievements.\n\nThe cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at it, saying: \"We exert ourselves in flight, striking the elm and sandalwood, and if we do not reach them, we simply descend to the ground—why go ninety thousand *li* to the south?\" Those who travel to the nearby wilderness return after three meals with their bellies still full; but those who journey a hundred *li* must pound grain the night before, and those who go a thousand *li* must gather provisions for three months. What do these two creatures know? This illustrates how petty knowledge cannot comprehend great knowledge. It means that those of limited vision in the world, unaware of the sage’s greatness, are like these two creatures whose flight is exhausted upon reaching the elm and sandalwood, and so they laugh at the Peng’s journey of ninety thousand *li*—what need is there for such a thing? This is to say that petty people, content with mere sustenance for body and mouth, see no use for the great Dao of the sage. Zhuangzi thus explains that the limited vision of worldly people, who do not understand the sage, stems from their lack of far-reaching aspirations, and so their cultivation remains shallow, each according to their capacity. Thus, those who travel to a place within sight need not store provisions, for a single meal suffices for the round trip, leaving them still satiated. This is like petty people, content with the present. Those who journey a hundred *li* have slightly greater aspirations, so they pound grain the night before; those who go a thousand *li* gather provisions for three months, for as their aspirations grow, so too does their preparation. Compared to these two creatures, born among the elm and sandalwood, utterly lacking in understanding and without any ambition for far-reaching flight, it is no wonder they laugh at the Peng’s flight. Such is the nature of the petty knowledge of the world. Petty knowledge cannot comprehend great knowledge, just as short years cannot comprehend long years (here, short and long years are used to further illustrate the difference between petty and great knowledge).",

      "translated_text": "How do we know this is so? The morning mushroom (a fungus growing in dung and decay, sprouting at dawn and withering by dusk) knows nothing of the waxing and waning of the moon; the cicada (a summer insect) knows nothing of spring and autumn—these are short-lived creatures. South of Chu there is the Dark Spirit (a divine turtle), for whom five hundred years make a spring, five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity there was the Great Camphor, for whom eight thousand years make a spring, eight thousand years an autumn—these are long-lived beings. Yet Pengzu (a man famed for his longevity) is now singled out for his enduring years, and when common people compare themselves to him, is it not lamentable? This, then, is why the two insects fail to comprehend the Peng’s vastness, just as those of petty knowledge cannot grasp the boundless wisdom of the sage—each confined to their own measure, and no wonder. How could the morning mushroom or the cicada ever know of the lifespans of the Dark Spirit or the Great Camphor? Moreover, people speak only of Pengzu’s eight hundred years, as if he were unique in all of history, and yet they rarely aspire to match even his longevity. Compared to the Great Camphor, Pengzu’s years are but a fleeting moment—how much more tragic is the plight of common folk. Such is the limit of petty knowledge.\n\nTang’s inquiry of Ji (Tang’s worthy minister) illustrates this same truth: that petty knowledge cannot fathom great knowledge. Far to the north of the barren lands lies the Dark Sea, a celestial lake (for both the Northern and Southern Dark Seas are oceans, hence the term \"celestial lake\"). There dwells a fish, its breadth spanning thousands of *li*, its length unknown—its name is Kun. There is also a bird, named Peng, its back like Mount Tai, its wings like clouds trailing from the sky. It mounts the whirlwind, spiraling upward ninety thousand *li*, piercing through the clouds, bearing the blue heavens on its back, then sets its course southward, bound for the Southern Dark Sea. The quail (a small bird of the marshes) laughs at it, saying: \"Where does it think it’s going? I leap and flutter no higher than a few *ren*, soaring among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the height of flight! Where does it think it’s going?\" Such is the distinction between the small and the great.\n\nEarlier, I cited the *Qi Xie* to verify the tale of Kun and Peng; now I invoke Tang’s inquiry of Ji to confirm the matter of petty and great knowledge. What was said above about the limits of petty knowledge—that it cannot comprehend great knowledge—is precisely what Tang once asked Ji. Yet here, the example of Kun and Peng not only proves the vastness of fish and bird but also underscores the distinction between small and great. Thus, one citation serves a dual purpose: the events are the same, but the intent differs.\n\nTherefore, those who (in bearing the above in mind) deem their knowledge sufficient to serve in one office, their conduct worthy of comparison to one village, their virtue pleasing to one ruler, or their credibility trusted by one state—they regard themselves as if they were that quail. Yet Song Rongzi would still laugh at them (Song Rongzi was a worthy man of Song. His laughter was directed at those four types of people, who toil ceaselessly for talent, wisdom, and the fleeting renown of their own narrow pursuits). Moreover, though the whole world praises them, they are not spurred on; though the whole world condemns them, they are not disheartened (disheartened: cast down, their countenance fallen). They have settled the division between inner and outer, discerned the boundary between honor and disgrace—this is all. (Song Rongzi’s laughter at those who toil for fleeting fame stems from his own ability to forget renown. Thus, though the whole world praises him, he is not encouraged; though the whole world condemns him, he is not disheartened. He merely affirms that his inner virtue is his own, while external slander or praise belongs to others—thus, neither affects his resolve. He knows that honor and disgrace have no bearing on him. This is all there is to it.) In his dealings with the world, he is not restless. (The reason Song Rongzi can forget slander and praise is simply that he does not strive for the world’s empty renown.) Yet he has not yet established himself. (He has not yet firmly rooted himself, for though he can forget fame, he has not forgotten the self.)\n\nLiezi could ride the wind and travel, moving with effortless grace, returning after fifteen days. In his pursuit of fortune, he was not restless. Though he was thus spared the need to walk, he still depended on something. (Though Liezi could forget misfortune and fortune, he had not forgotten life and death. His form and bones remained bound, so he could not wander with the Creator through the infinite. He relied on the wind to ascend, and after no more than fifteen days, he returned—it was no eternal departure.)\n\nAs for one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth (constancy: the fundamental nature of Heaven and Earth, as in the constancy of each thing’s nature and destiny), who harnesses the transformations of the six qi (riding Heaven and Earth, the cosmos is within you. The six qi—yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and light—are the vital forces of creation. Harnessing the six qi, creation is born within the self, and one who thus rides the Great Dao is a true wanderer), and roams the boundless—what does such a one have to depend on? (The sage who rides the Great Dao and wanders, merging with creation as one, what external thing could he possibly depend on?)\n\nThus it is said: The Perfect One is without self, the Spirit-like One is without achievement, the Sage is without name. (The Perfect One, the Spirit-like One, and the Sage are but one—they need not be viewed as three. This describes the sage who has attained true freedom. The sage forgets form and transcends dependence, rising above life and death, dwelling beyond the myriad transformations, vast and unconstrained, delighting in the Dao, unburdened by things. Only such a one attains true freedom, which those of petty knowledge cannot comprehend.)",

      "translated_text": "Zhuangzi’s fundamental intent in his writings is to declare that no one in ancient or modern times has ever attained true freedom—all are shackled by this flesh-and-blood form, ensnared by the self, and thus ceaselessly pursue achievement and fame, tormenting themselves through life without a single moment of ease. Clinging solely to the bodily frame, they know nothing beyond it; how could they ever glimpse the Great Dao? Only the sage who has transformed through the vastness of the Dao forgets the self, forgets achievement, forgets fame, transcends life and death, and wanders in the realm of the Great Dao—thus attaining boundless freedom and joy without end. How could those of narrow, petty understanding ever comprehend this? It is no different from the cicada and the quail mocking the roc. His central point is simply this: the sage’s realm is beyond the reach of small minds, and so he crafts the tale of the roc’s transformations to startle the eyes and ears of the world. Yet these are all allegories, meant to shock the vulgar. He begins with seemingly unrelated matters, only here revealing his true intent, concluding with a single phrase to tie it all together. Such is the artistry of literary composition—none but one of vast spirit could muster such force. Only those who have cultivated themselves can truly grasp its wonder.\n\nThe foregoing is allegory. What follows points directly to the sage who has forgotten the self, forgotten achievement, and forgotten fame, offering proof.\n\nWhen Yao offered the world to Xu You, he said: “The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—how can its light compare? The seasonal rains have fallen, yet I still irrigate—how exhausting is my labor in vain! If you, Master, were to stand forth, the world would govern itself, yet I remain in this seat. I see my own inadequacy. I beg to yield the world to you.” Xu You replied: “You have governed the world, and the world is already well governed. If I were to replace you, would I do so for the sake of fame? Fame is but the guest of reality—would I become a mere guest? The wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs only a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes only enough to fill its belly. Return, my lord, and rest! What use have I for the world? Even if the cook neglects his kitchen, the priest would not step beyond the sacrificial vessels to take his place.”",

      "translated_text": "Building upon the preceding passage, the discussion of Song Rongzi distinguishes three grades of individuals: those who forget themselves for fame, those who forget merit, and those who forget fame itself. Here, Yao’s abdication of the world, though it demonstrates forgetfulness of merit, still clings to the renown of abdication. Xu You’s refusal of the world, though it demonstrates forgetfulness of fame, remains self-satisfied—thus failing to forget the self. Only the divine person of Guye, described below, embodies the great transformation of the transcendent sage who has forgotten all distinctions, thereby revealing the true realization of freedom.\n\nJian Wu said to Lian Shu: “I heard Jie Yu speak words vast yet groundless, drifting away without return. I was alarmed by his speech—it seemed as boundless as the Milky Way, wildly extravagant, far removed from human sensibilities.” Lian Shu asked: “What did he say?” Jian Wu replied: “On the distant Mount Guye dwells a divine person. Her skin is like ice and snow, her grace like that of a maiden. She does not eat the five grains, but draws sustenance from wind and dew. She rides the clouds and qi, harnesses flying dragons, and roams beyond the four seas. Her spirit is concentrated, so that no blight or pestilence arises where she passes, and the harvests ripen in due season. Yet I deem this madness and do not believe it.”\n\nLian Shu said: “Indeed, the blind cannot partake in the spectacle of patterns, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums. Is it only the body that suffers deafness and blindness? The mind, too, may be afflicted. Your words reveal just such a condition—like a woman’s limited understanding. This person, this power, pervades the ten thousand things, merging with them as one. Were she to seek order in the world, who would trouble themselves with the wearisome business of governance? This person is untouched by harm, for things cannot injure her. Though the great floods rise to the heavens, she does not drown; though the fiercest drought melts metal and stone and scorches the mountains, she does not feel the heat. Even the dust and chaff of her virtue could mold and cast a Yao or Shun—who would deign to make worldly affairs her concern?”\n\nThis passage elucidates the power of the perfected ones—the transcendent, the divine, the sages—who ride the heavens and earth and master the six qi, revealing the true nature of the Great Ancestral Master. Were such a person compelled to engage with the world, she would become a sage emperor or enlightened king; yet if she remained unattached to governance, her mere leavings and remnants would suffice to transform the world. She would never deign to toil like Yao or Shun, exhausting herself in the affairs of state. This is the ultimate expression of governing through non-action—only such a person could achieve it.\n\nThe people of Song peddled ceremonial caps to Yue, where the people cut their hair and tattoo their bodies, finding no use for such things. This illustrates how Yao, valuing the world, offered it to Xu You, unaware that Xu You had no use for it—just as the Yue found no use for the caps. Yao governed the people and brought order to the realm. Yet when he visited the four masters on the southern slopes of Mount Guye by the Fen River, he was suddenly and utterly stripped of his attachment to the world.\n\nThis passage clarifies Yao’s abdication to Xu You and Xu You’s refusal: though Xu You declined the world, he could not free Yao from his attachment to it, nor could he relinquish the renown of refusal, for he had not yet forgotten the self. But upon encountering the divine person, Yao instantly lost all claim to the world—proof of the divine person’s effortless mastery in governance.",

      "original_text": "一书立言之意，尽在此一语，不但为逍遥之结文而已也。 庄子文章，观者似乎纵横洸洋自恣，而其中属意精密严整之不可当，即逍遥一篇，精意入神之如此。 逍遥之意已结，所谓寓言、重言，而后文乃卮言也。 大似诙谐戏剧之意，以发自己心事。 谓人以庄子所言，大而无用，但人不善用，不知无用之用为大用，故假惠子以发之。 惠子谓庄子曰：“魏王遗（馈也）我大瓠之种（惠子魏人，故言魏王），我树之成而实五石（瓠之子有五石之多，言其大如此）。 以盛水浆，其坚（重也）不能自举（言一人举不动）也。 剖之以为瓢，则瓠落（言廓落之大，没处安顿）无所容。 非不呺然（大貌）大也，吾为其无用而掊之（言击碎之也）。 ”庄子曰：“夫子固拙于用大矣（言惠子不能善用其大也）。 宋人有善为不龟（音均，言寒冻，手背皮绽裂，如龟背之纹也）手之药者（言能治使手不皲裂之药者），世世以洴澼（漂洗也）絖（旧棉絮也）为事（言因有不裂手之药，故世世以此为业）。 客闻之，请买其方百金（客闻其方妙，故重价买之）。 聚族而谋曰：‘我世世为洴澼絖，不过数金（所获之利薄）； 今一朝而鬻技百金（言难一，且而得厚利，且而不损己），请与之（不知客所用大也）。 ’客得之，以说（去声）吴王。 越有难，吴王使之将（使得方之人以为将）。 冬，与越人水战，大败越人（言吴有此药，故士卒能兵； 越无之，故败也），裂地（列土以封）而封之（言以此药，致封侯也）。 能不龟手，一也； 或以封，或不免于洴澼絖，则所用之异也（庄子以此喻惠子不善用其无用也）。 今子有五石之瓠，何不虑（思其可用处）以为大樽（以瓠为度水之樽，如今之渔舟小儿背瓠，可知也）而浮于江湖（此以所用之大也），而忧其瓠落无所容？ 则夫子犹有蓬之心（蓬有心而不通，此嘲惠子一窍不通，正卮言也）也夫！ ” 此一节，庄子以自创逍遥神人之说，以明无用之大用，盖亦有自寓己意，言世无所知也。 惠子乃庄子生平相契之友，故托嘲调以见己意。 盖亦言，其虽有圣人，必须举世有见知者，而后乃得见用于当世也。 言虽戏剧，而心良苦矣。 此等文，要得其趣，则不可以正解，别是一种风味，所谓诗有别趣也。 后诸篇中，似此寓意者多，学者不可不知也。 前虽说不善用其大，尚未说无用之用，故下文以大树发之。 惠子谓庄子曰：“吾有大树，人谓之樗（樗散，无用之木）。 其大本（树大身也）臃肿而不中绳墨（言不材之甚），其小枝卷曲而不中规矩（言不可裁取也）。 立之涂（喻当要路），匠者（喻当世执政之人）不顾（喻不为世所采录也）。 今子之言，大而无用（言虽大而无实用），众所同去（言为众人所共弃也）也。 ”庄子曰：“子独不见狸狌乎（庄子因惠子说大无用，遂将狐狸、野菌之小巧，以比惠子，并世用小知者，皆不得其死）？ 卑身而伏，以候敖者（以比小知之人，卑身谄求以取功利，俟其机会，如狸狌之伏身，以候敖者）； 东西跳梁，不避高下（以喻世人无知，但知求利，恣肆妄行，不避利害）； 中于机辟（此机辟，以取狸狌者），死于罔罟（以罔罟罗取狸狌，因不避高下，故堕死于机罔之中，以喻世人之恃知求利名者，亦若此而已）。",
      "translated_text": "The intent behind this entire work culminates in this single passage—it is not merely the concluding lines of the *Free and Easy Wandering* chapter. Though Zhuangzi’s prose may appear unbounded, flowing freely and indulging in whimsy, its underlying structure is meticulously precise and unassailable. Even in the *Free and Easy Wandering* alone, the depth of its meaning is so profound. Having resolved the meaning of *free and easy wandering*, the text then employs *parables* and *weighted words*, followed by *unconstrained speech*—much like the spirit of jest and theater, through which the author expresses his own heart’s concerns.\n\nPeople dismiss Zhuangzi’s words as grand but useless, yet the fault lies not in the words but in their inability to grasp that the usefulness of the \"useless\" is the greatest use of all. Thus, he invokes Huizi to illustrate this point. Huizi said to Zhuangzi: \"The King of Wei bestowed upon me the seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to bear fruit weighing five *dan*. When I used it to hold water, its weight was such that I could not lift it alone. When I split it to make a ladle, its vastness left no place to store it. It was not that it wasn’t impressively large—it was simply useless, so I smashed it.\"\n\nZhuangzi replied: \"You are truly inept at putting great things to use. There was a man from Song skilled in making a salve that prevented chapped hands. For generations, his family earned their living by washing silk floss. A traveler heard of this and offered a hundred pieces of gold for the formula. The family gathered to deliberate: ‘For generations, we’ve washed silk floss and barely made a few coins. Now, in a single morning, we could sell this skill for a hundred gold—let us give it to him.’ The traveler acquired the formula and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue invaded, the King of Wu appointed the traveler as a general. That winter, they fought a naval battle against Yue, and Wu decisively defeated them. The king then granted the traveler a fiefdom. The ability to prevent chapped hands was the same in both cases, yet one man gained a fief while another remained a silk-washer—all because of how they applied it. Now, you have a gourd of five *dan*—why not consider making it into a great float and drifting upon the rivers and lakes? Instead, you fret that it is too large to contain anything. Clearly, your mind is as tangled as the heart of a *peng* plant!\"\n\nThis passage reveals Zhuangzi’s self-fashioned doctrine of the *free and easy* divine person, illustrating the great use of the \"useless\"—a reflection of his own sentiments, lamenting that the world fails to recognize true wisdom. Huizi was Zhuangzi’s closest friend in life, so he playfully teased him to convey his meaning. It also subtly suggests that even a sage requires a world that understands him before he can be put to use in his time. Though the words seem playful, the heart behind them is deeply earnest. Such writing must be appreciated for its spirit, not parsed literally—it possesses a distinct flavor, what one might call the \"separate delight of poetry.\" Many passages in later chapters employ similar allegorical intent, which scholars must not overlook.\n\nEarlier, the text addressed the failure to use greatness properly but had not yet expounded on the use of the \"useless.\" Thus, the following passage uses the great tree to develop this idea. Huizi said to Zhuangzi: \"I have a great tree—people call it the *chu*. Its trunk is swollen and gnarled, unfit for the carpenter’s line, and its branches are twisted, defying compass and square. Even if planted by the roadside, no craftsman would glance at it. Your words, too, are grand but useless, and so the world unanimously rejects them.\"\n\nZhuangzi replied: \"Have you never observed the wildcat or the weasel? They crouch low, lying in wait for their prey, leaping east and west without regard for height or depth. Yet they fall into traps and snares, dying in nets. Now consider the yak: vast as a thundercloud, it is too large to be caught in snares. But you have a great tree and fret over its uselessness—why not plant it in the land of nothingness, where you might wander in its shade, resting beneath it without care? It will not be felled by axes, nor will harm come to it. If it is of no use, what affliction can befall it?\"",

      "translated_text": "Now the yak of the southern mountains—its size is like a cloud hanging in the sky (though the yak may not truly be so vast, this is but a figurative expression). Such magnitude it possesses, yet it cannot catch a mouse (though the yak may loom as large as the clouds, even so vast a creature cannot seize a mouse—this speaks to the utter greatness that cannot stoop to petty trifles). You, sir, have a great tree and fret over its uselessness (since you already possess this great tree, why lament its lack of use? Let it remain useless). Why not plant it in the land of nothingness (this is Zhuangzi’s self-allusion—though vast and useless, if the world does not require its use, why not simply leave it in a place of no use?), the boundless wilds (this phrase, like \"land of nothingness,\" alludes to the realm of the Dao)? There you may wander carefree at its side, roam at ease beneath its boughs (the perfected person, though useless, wanders with the Dao, so that whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, joy abounds—what cause for concern is there?). It will not be felled by axes (the tree, being already useless, and planted where none tread, will not suffer the bite of blades—this mirrors the sage, who seeks nothing from the world and thus escapes its harm), nor will any thing bring it harm (being of no use and placed beyond the reach of men, what harm could befall it?). If it is of no use, where lies its affliction?\n\nThis passage uses Huizi to mock Zhuangzi’s uselessness, while Zhuangzi in turn mocks Huizi’s pursuit of fame and profit through petty cleverness—a pursuit as perilous as the wildcat that cannot escape the snare. But the perfected person, seeking nothing from the world, though deemed useless, finds joy in the Dao and lives out his natural span. Is this not the great use of preserving life and nurturing the Way? Thus, what appears useless may yet be free from affliction. Though these words are playful, they reveal Zhuangzi’s contentment with his own heart—how could those of petty understanding ever comprehend it?\n\n**On the Equality of Things**\nThe term \"equality of things\" refers to the debates and disputes of people across ages, where no true sage of great awakening exists, and each school clings to its own limited knowledge and narrow views, insisting on its own rightness. Since each person takes their own perspective as correct, all others in the world must be wrong, leaving not a single truth to be found. At the highest level, this manifests in the mutual refutations of the Confucians and Mohists; at the lower, in the clashing opinions of the various schools, each asserting its own rightness while condemning others. Thus, in the end, no one can rightly harmonize them. The difficulty of equalizing such debates has persisted for ages—all due to the failure to see clearly.\n\nZhuangzi’s intent in proposing the equality of things is that only a truly awakened person, one who has forgotten self and others, can perceive with true knowledge and true awakening, dissolving the distinctions between self and other, and merging with the great Dao. In this way, the debates over things need not be forcibly equalized, for right and wrong naturally vanish, leaving no trace of self, other, right, or wrong. This is the great purport of the equality of things.\n\nThe text begins by establishing the forgetting of self as paramount. If one does not cling to one’s own views or insist on one’s own rightness, one must awaken to the true master within, shedding the false self of flesh and form. Then one naturally merges with the realm of the Dao. This is the practice of equalizing things. Only when one reaches the great transformation where self and other are both forgotten—like the butterfly dream—does one attain the true realization of the equality of things.",

As for the *heaven-lai*, it is the speech of all people, arising naturally from the marvel of the heavenly mechanism. Yet most people cling to the self-view, making cunning the master, unlike the wind that blows through the *earth-lai*. Hence, the conflict of right and wrong arises. If one speaks without cunning, then there is neither affirmation nor negation—how could there be right or wrong between self and other? This is the foundational intent of its argument.\n\nLaozi said: \"Between heaven and earth, is it not like a bellows? Empty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it yields. Excessive speech leads to exhaustion—better to abide in the center.\" This passage from the *Qi Wu* (Equalizing Things) is clearly its annotation. By this, one grasps more than half its meaning.\n\nNan Guo Ziqi (a man of the Dao who dwelled in reclusion at Nan Guo), leaning against his armrest in seated stillness (sitting upright, suddenly forgetting his body, like Yanzi’s \"fasting of the mind\"—this is the first step in the practice of equalizing things), looked up to the sky and sighed (laughing at himself for forgetting his body), his form slackened (his body dissolved, as if he no longer perceived it), seemingly having lost his counterpart (this fleshly form is but the counterpart of the true lord; now, suddenly forgetting it, he seemed to have lost his counterpart).\n\nYan Cheng Ziyou (a disciple of Ziqi) stood attending before him and asked: \"What is this? (How can you be so at ease as to appear thus?) The body may indeed be made like withered wood, but can the mind truly be made like dead ashes? (Having forgotten the body, the mechanism of the mind ceases, so the mind becomes like dead ashes. Ziyou asks: Can body and mind truly be made like withered wood and dead ashes?) The one who leans here today is not the same as the one who leaned here before. (Before, when I saw you leaning, there was still vitality; now, you are like withered wood and dead ashes—vastly different from before.)\"\n\nZiqi replied: \"Yan (Ziyou’s name), is it not well that you ask this? (Your question is far from good!) Today, I have lost my self (I refer to my true self; *losing the self* means forgetting this fleshly form)—do you understand? (Do you grasp what it means for me to lose my self?)\" This *Qi Wu Lun* (Equalizing Things) begins with the loss of the self to reveal that the right and wrong of the world all stem from the self-view. To equalize things, one must take the forgetting of the self as the foremost principle. Thus, the sage of *xiaoyao* (free and easy wandering) must first forget the self, then forget merit, and then forget fame. This is the intent of its argument.\n\n\"You have heard of the *human-lai* (the sound of flutes and pipes), but not the *earth-lai* (as in the passage below, where the long wind rises and the myriad hollows roar in unison); you have heard of the *earth-lai*, but not the *heaven-lai* (the speech of the multitude, which arises spontaneously from the heavenly mechanism)!\"\n\nIn introducing the *Qi Wu Lun* with the three *lai*, the aim is to awaken people to the source of their own speech—its arising from the heavenly mechanism. If one can forget cunning and speak without intent, like the wind blowing through hollows, how could there be right or wrong? Understanding the purpose of these three *lai* reveals the greater meaning.\n\nZiyou said: \"May I ask the method (of the three *lai*)?\" Ziqi replied (first explaining the *earth-lai*): \"The great clod (heaven and earth) exhales *qi*, and this is called wind (the great wind is the exhalation of heaven and earth, like the *xiaoyao*—the wind of the sixth month is called *xi*, playing with the workings of creation). When it does not arise (when the wind does not stir), the myriad hollows remain silent. When it arises, the myriad hollows roar in anger. Have you alone not heard the *liu-liu* (the sound of the long wind as it first rises)?\n\nThe towering forests and rugged mountains, the hollows of great trees a hundred spans in girth (in the deep mountains, great trees with trunks a hundred spans wide are riddled with hollows)—some resemble noses (the shapes of the hollows below resemble the two nostrils of a human nose), some mouths (like a human mouth lying horizontally), some ears (like a human ear hanging askew), some beams (*ji*, with square holes resembling a beam’s mortise), some rings (with round holes like a ring), some mortars (with holes narrow inside and wide outside, like a pounding mortar), some depressions (with long holes like a water-filled depression), some puddles (with shallow holes like a muddy puddle. The above describes the forms of the hollows; below, their sounds):\n\nSome rush (like water dashing against stone), some *xiao* (resembling the sound of a whistling arrow), some scold (like a person scolding an ox), some inhale (like a person drawing breath, the sound faint as if withdrawing), some cry out (like a person shouting loudly), some wail (like a low, mournful howl), some whimper (like a dog’s faint, lingering bark), some bark (like a dog’s sharp bark. The above describes the sounds of the hollows).\n\nThe first gust (the leading wind) sings softly, and the following gusts respond in harmony. A gentle breeze (*ling* wind) elicits a faint chorus (as the wind blows, the myriad hollows sound in harmony), a whirlwind (*piao* wind) elicits a great chorus, and when the fierce wind ceases, the myriad hollows fall silent (the sounds of the hollows arise with the wind’s stirring;...\"",
      "overlap_context": "he text begins by establishing the forgetting of self as paramount. If one does not cling to one’s own views or insist on one’s own rightness, one must awaken to the true master within, shedding the false self of flesh and form. Then one naturally merges with the realm of the Dao. This is the practice of equalizing things. Only when one reaches the great transformation where self and other are both forgotten—like the butterfly dream—does one attain the true realization of the equality of things.",

      "translated_text": "When the great wind ceases, the myriad hollows fall utterly silent—this shows that sound has no intrinsic existence.\n\nYet have you alone not observed the *tiao-tiao* and *diao-diao*? (These are the lingering tremors of grasses and trees after the wind has stilled. Though the wind has ceased, the grasses and trees continue to sway without end. This subtly compares the world’s disputes: the one who sang is gone, yet people still cling to their threads of argument, each insisting on their own rightness.)\n\nThis parable of the long wind and the myriad hollows illustrates how the Great Dao, flowing with the Creator, disperses among the people like a long wind stirring the ten thousand hollows. Each person receives a different form and vessel, so their knowledge and perceptions vary, and their discourses diverge—just as the hollows, receiving the wind in varying degrees of strength and depth, produce sounds that differ in pitch, volume, and duration. This is why the multitude of opinions can never be uniform.\n\nThus, in ancient times, the one who sang first did so softly, while those who responded afterward did so with great vigor, each harmonizing according to what they heard—just as people inherit differing teachings from their masters. The one who sang first is already dead, yet those who follow still pursue the debate without end, like grasses and trees that continue to sway after the wind has stilled.\n\nYet the wind of heaven is but a single qi, arising naturally, with no cunning intent lurking within. Such are the words of the sage—uttered without premeditation. But alas, the multitude cling to their own views, speaking from cunning intent rather than from spontaneity, and thus is non born. The following passage states, *\"Words are not the blowing itself,\"* to clarify that the disparity in opinions arises entirely from cunning intent and self-attachment, a failure to perceive things clearly. This is the pivot of argumentation. Understand this, and you may grasp the *Qi Wu* (Equalizing Things).\n\nZiyou said: *\"The earthly *lai* (sound) is simply the myriad hollows; the human *lai* is the pipes of bamboo (since you already understand the earthly *lai*, the human *lai* must be the bamboo pipes—no need to elaborate further). May I ask about the heavenly *lai*?\"*\n\nZiqi replied: *\"The blowing of the ten thousand [hollows] differs, yet each finds its own resolution (the heavenly *lai* is the natural mechanism by which people utter words—the blowing of the ten thousand differs)... each takes what it will.

For *\"those who know succession\"* are sages who recognize the bodily frame as a temporary vessel, thus forgetting form and taking the heart as their own.) *\"Even the foolish possess it!\"* (Even the foolish share in this!) *\"Before the heart is fully realized, there is right and wrong\"* (before one awakens to the originally present true heart, one establishes notions of right and wrong), *\"this is like arriving in Yue today when you set out yesterday\"* (claiming to have arrived when one has not—such is the self-deception of right and wrong). *\"Thus, taking what is not as what is\"* (claiming what is not attained as attained, pretending ignorance is knowledge). *\"Taking what is not as what is\"* (those who deceive themselves in this way), *\"even the divine Yu could not know\"* (though the sage Yu’s knowledge was vast, he could only know what he had truly attained; for those who take what is not as what is, how could he know them?) *\"What then can I do?\"* (If even Yu cannot know them, what can I do? This emphasizes how difficult it is to speak of the great Dao with such people.)\n\nThis passage speaks of the root of right and wrong, arising from those who deceive themselves, pretending ignorance is knowledge, clinging to their own views as absolute truth—thus, everything else is wrong. They have not awakened to the true knowledge that is originally present but cling to deluded knowledge as truth. Even sages can do nothing with such people. What a pity that the true heart, already present, is obscured and unrecognized—how lamentable! Because they do not awaken to the true heart, they cling to their own views as right and others as wrong—this is the root of the disease of right and wrong.\n\nWhat follows clarifies the central meaning of the *\"Discourse on Equalizing Things.\"* *\"Words are not the wind’s blowing\"* (earlier, he expounded on how people do not awaken to the true master but cling to their own views. Without following the originally present true heart but clinging to deluded perceptions, each person’s knowledge and views differ. Now he enters the *\"Discourse on Things,\"* saying that people’s words arise from the machinations of the heart, not like the wind blowing through hollows). *\"Those who speak have their words\"* (thus, what they speak does not come from the true master but from the words of a scheming heart). *\"What they speak is merely unsettled\"* (relying on one’s own biased views, what they speak is never definitively right or wrong). *\"Do they truly have words? Or have they never truly spoken?\"* (This urges one to turn inward: are these words originally present?)",

      "translated_text": "Have they never truly spoken? This single question alone suffices to make one realize. And thus, the work of the *\"Discourse on Equalizing Things\"* is briefly revealed here.\n\nIs it different from the chick’s cry? (The chick’s cry refers to the peeping of a bird about to hatch from its shell—this is the sound of Heaven’s mechanism, arising entirely without intention. Yet human speech, born of intention, differs from the chick’s cry. This urges one to reflect.) Is there then debate? Or is there no debate? (Debate here means contention between opposing views. It asks: when one regards speech as no different from the chick’s cry, does debate arise? Or does it not? This prompts one to observe the moment of speech and turn inward.)\n\nThis passage begins to clarify the inequality of things’ discourse. First, it points out that words and sounds are fundamentally without right or wrong. If one allows Heaven’s mechanism to express itself, then there is no debate over right and wrong. Yet the essence of equalizing things lies precisely in the absence of speech, and this principle has already been revealed here. It urges one to work at this point, to see through Heaven’s mechanism, and then right and wrong will naturally dissolve.\n\nFrom *\"Now, words are not like the wind’s blowing\"* onward, through to the end of the *\"Completion and Deficiency\"* chapter—*\"this is called illumination\"*—spans a single great section of over seven hundred and forty characters. Each passage brims with vitality, and the thread is most difficult to follow; only with careful and deep observation can one grasp its subtlety.\n\nWhat follows directly points out that those who engage in right and wrong are the kind who lose the true and cling to delusion. Where is the Dao obscured, that there should be truth and falsehood? (Obscured means hidden and unclear. The Great Dao is originally without truth or falsehood. Here, the question is posed: Why is the Dao unclear, giving rise to truth and falsehood?) Where are words obscured, that there should be right and wrong? (The words of the true person are originally without right or wrong. The question is: Why are true words obscured, giving rise to right and wrong?) Where does the Dao go that it does not abide? (If the Dao has no truth or falsehood, then there is nothing to accept or reject—where would it not abide?) Where do words abide that they cannot be spoken? (If words arise naturally, following Heaven’s mechanism, then what is there that cannot be said? Yet because the Dao is obscured, words become false; when words are partial, right and wrong arise from them.)\n\nThe Dao is obscured by petty accomplishments (The Dao is not inherently obscured, but it is hidden from those of limited understanding. What they accomplish is small, so the Great Dao remains unmanifest). Words are obscured by florid ornamentation (Florid ornamentation refers to empty, insubstantial speech. Because words do not convey the Dao but instead indulge in superficial embellishment, the profound is obscured). Thus arise the right and wrong of the Confucians and Mohists (Here, the origin of right and wrong is finally pointed out, as the discussion is directed specifically at the Confucians and Mohists. The Confucians advocate elaborate funerals, while Mozi rejects them, leading to mutual criticism. At the time, Zhuangzi was a contemporary of Mencius; Mencius refuted Yang Zhu, and Mozi said, *\"How could I delight in debate?\"* Thus arose the debate over right and wrong. Hence, Confucians and Mohists are addressed together). They affirm what the other denies and deny what the other affirms (The Confucians regard elaborate funerals as right, which Mozi denies—thus, they affirm what the other denies. Mozi regards frugal mourning as right, which the Confucians reject—thus, they deny what the other affirms). If you wish to affirm what the other denies and deny what the other affirms, then nothing is better than illumination (The Confucians and Mohists mutually affirm and deny, yet neither has grasped the Great Dao; each merely clings to their own views, without necessarily being truly right. If you wish to affirm what the other denies and deny what the other affirms, nothing is better than illuminating the Great Dao, and then the debate over right and wrong will vanish).\n\nThis passage directly identifies the origin of right and wrong as arising from the Confucians and Mohists. Though there were recluses who criticized them at the time, the Confucians and Mohists were the first to raise the issue. The implication is that while Yang Zhu and Mozi had already lost sight of benevolence and righteousness, the Confucians had also failed to grasp the Great Dao. Thus, neither school possessed an absolute truth. This serves as the foundation for the argument. For the debate over right and wrong originated with the Confucians and Mohists, spread to the various masters, and later focused specifically on Hui Shi—all of them people who failed to understand, and thus lost the Dao.\n\nBelow, it first clarifies that right and wrong are originally absent, yet people do not realize this and so cling to their own views, giving rise to right and wrong. There is nothing that is not the other (If one person in the world clings to their own views, then everyone else becomes \"the other.\" Hence, there is nothing that is not the other). There is nothing that is not right (If one person regards themselves as right, then everyone regards themselves as right, and thus nothing in the world is not right. Hence, there is nothing that is not right). From the other, one does not see (If one only sees the other’s wrong, then one does not see one’s own wrong). Through self-knowledge, one knows it (If one knows one’s own wrong, then one knows that nothing in the world is not right. Hence, *\"through self-knowledge, one knows it.\"*). Thus it is said: the other arises from the right (The other’s wrong arises from my right), and the right also depends on the other (My right also depends on the other’s wrong. Because people do not know themselves, they cling to their own right, and thus cannot dissolve right and wrong).\n\nThis passage speaks of how people suffer from not knowing themselves, and so regard their own rightness as absolute. If they were to exchange places and observe from the other’s perspective, then self and other would both be forgotten, right and wrong would dissolve, and one would see that right and wrong were originally absent.\n\nBelow, it further clarifies that right and wrong are fundamentally absent, arising only through opposition. The other (the other’s wrong) and the right (my right) are the theories that arise from opposition (Opposition here means comparison and contrast. Right and wrong are originally absent, arising only through the opposition of self and other). Nevertheless (the following turns to show that opposition has no end), as soon as there is life, there is death; as soon as there is death, there is life (The opposition of right and wrong is like life and death: life gives way to death, death gives way to life, endlessly cycling without end).",

      "translated_text": "If one takes the word \"death\" as \"annihilation,\" this too is profound); as soon as there is approval, there is disapproval, and as soon as there is disapproval, there is approval (what is right is approved, what is not is disapproved. Thus, there is never a time when both are approved). This arises from that right, and that right arises from this wrong (this right exists because of that wrong, and that right exists because of this wrong—all due to the failure to know and see for oneself). Therefore, the sage does not follow the path of others but illuminates it by the heavens, and this too is \"right\" (the sage does not adhere to the world’s right and wrong but alone illuminates the natural great Dao, thus what is truly right is right, hence it is also called \"right.\" This means the sage’s \"right\" is the true right seen through illumination, unlike ordinary people who cling to their own views as right and falsely deem others wrong. This is Laozi’s \"modeling oneself after Heaven\").\n\nThis passage explains that the right and wrong of the world are deluded, obstinate illusions, ceaselessly clashing between self and other. Only the sage does not follow the crowd’s views but truly knows and alone illuminates the natural great Dao, clearly seeing what is truly right—hence it is also called \"right.\" This is vastly different from the multitude, so the word \"also\" distinguishes it. Earlier, it was said: rather than engaging in the mutual right-wrong disputes of Confucians and Mohists, it is better to be *illuminated*—*illumination* here means seeing through. Thus, the sage illuminates by the heavens, substantiating and clarifying it. This is the work of *equalizing things*, meaning that seeing through eliminates opposition. The following text elaborates on the meaning of *transcending opposition* and concludes with \"it is better to be illuminated.\"\n\n\"This is also that, and that is also this\" (following the sage’s work of seeing through, one realizes that my right is that wrong, and that wrong is also my right. Viewed thus, where is there right and wrong?). \"That also has its right and wrong, and this also has its right and wrong\" (viewed thus, right and wrong are both forgotten). Is there truly that (that wrong) and this (my right)? Or is there truly no that and this? (If right and wrong merge into the great Dao, is there truly right and wrong? Or is there truly no right and wrong?)\n\nWhen that and this find no counterpart, it is called the *pivot of the Dao* (when right and wrong are forgotten, all is level and unified, transcending all opposition—thus that and this find no counterpart. *Counterpart* means opposition. Transcending opposition is the wondrous pivot of the Dao). Once the pivot is grasped at the center of the ring, it can respond endlessly (a ring is not square; its emptiness at the center makes it lively and responsive, like the Dao’s emptiness. If one attains this empty pivot of the Dao, one can respond to endless change). \"This\" is also an endless, \"not-this\" is also an endless (when right and wrong dissolve into the great Dao, \"this\" is also the Dao, and \"not-this\" is also the Dao—like Zhuangzi’s disparagement of Yao and Shun, this is unity with the great Dao).\n\nThus it is said: \"It is better to be illuminated\" (earlier, it was said: rather than the right-wrong disputes of Confucians and Mohists, it is better to be illuminated. When the sage sees through, right and wrong vanish, and one roams with the Dao—then everywhere is the abode of the great Dao. Thus it concludes: it is better to be illuminated). This passage explains that when the sage sees through, right and wrong naturally vanish, harmonizing with the great Dao and responding endlessly. Its wonder lies entirely in *illumination*. This urges people to awaken to illumination as the true right, so that the judgments of things need not be equalized but equalize themselves. This is Laozi’s \"Heaven follows the Dao.\"\n\nBelow, the text uses pointing at a horse as a metaphor for the original absence of right and wrong. To take pointing as not pointing (using my pointing finger to illustrate that another’s middle finger is not my pointing finger) is not as good as taking not-pointing to illustrate not-pointing (not as good as using that middle finger to illustrate that my pointing finger is not that middle finger). To take a horse as not a horse (the horse in the game of *shuanglu*—horses are distinguished as black and white, yet both are horses. If one takes that black horse to illustrate that my white horse is not that black horse) is not as good as taking not-a-horse to illustrate not-a-horse (not as good as using that black horse to illustrate that my white horse is not that black horse).\n\nHeaven and earth are one pointing, the myriad things are one horse (if one views this from another perspective, pointing and horse are not two, and right and wrong naturally vanish. Through the sage’s illumination, viewing it broadly, not only do the right and wrong of self and others vanish, but heaven and earth are born with me, and the myriad things are one with me. Thus, heaven and earth are one pointing, the myriad things are one horse—where then is the debate of self and other, right and wrong? This expands on the phrase \"it is better to be illuminated,\" revealing the sage’s illumination of the natural great Dao and explaining the meaning of *illumination*. Thus, it concludes the work of seeing through, truly dissolving right and wrong and equalizing the myriad things, urging people to focus on this).\n\nThis passage elaborates that when the sage sees through, right and wrong vanish, and heaven, earth, and the myriad things merge into one. The following explains the reason for this unity.\n\nWhat is approved is approved (if others approve, I also approve accordingly), what is disapproved is disapproved (if others disapprove, I also disapprove accordingly). The Dao is realized in its course (to follow the Dao is to act without failing to accord with it. *Realized* and *naturally so* need not be distinguished). Things are called so and thus are so (what is called so is naturally so). How is it so? (What is the reason for its being so?)",

      "translated_text": "The \"so\" is so within one’s own mind (referring to what one deems so in one’s own heart). Why is it not so (why do others deem it not so)? It is not so in their \"not-so\" (what others deem not so is merely their own refusal to accept it as so). Things inherently have their \"so\" (each thing has its own definite \"so.\" For example, with medicinal herbs like ginseng and aconite: when ginseng is used, aconite is not so; yet when aconite is used, ginseng is not so. Thus, each thing has its own inherent reality). Things inherently have their \"permissible\" (what is impermissible here may be permissible elsewhere). There is nothing that is not so, nothing that is not permissible (from this perspective, all things under heaven are so, and all are permissible).\n\nThus, take the example of a *ting* (rafter) and a *ying* (pillar), *Li* (a man afflicted with leprosy) and Xi Shi (a beautiful woman), the vast (*hui*), the deceptive (*gui*), the cunning (*jué*), and the strange (*guài*). The Dao unites them as one (the length of the rafter and pillar, the beauty and ugliness of Li and Xi Shi, the shifting forms of the vast, deceptive, cunning, and strange—judged by human sentiment, they appear disparate, making it difficult to escape right and wrong. Yet viewed through the eye of the Dao, distinctions of long and short, beauty and ugliness vanish, all merging into perfect equality. Without awakening to the great Dao, one cannot harmonize the judgments of all things under heaven).\n\nTheir division is their completion (when a great tree is cut to make vessels, the division of the wood is the completion of the vessel); their completion is their destruction (though the vessel is complete, the wood is destroyed—how can one cling to a fixed notion of completion or destruction?). All things have no completion or destruction; they reunite as one (viewed from one side, there seems to be completion and destruction; viewed comprehensively, there is neither. Thus, they reunite as one. Observing all things this way, what right and wrong can there be?). This explains the meaning of \"heaven and earth as one finger, the myriad things as one horse\"—only when viewed through the eye of the Dao do the appearances of right and wrong vanish. With right and wrong dissolved, the Dao unites all as one.\n\nThe following points to the return to the Dao. Only the enlightened (those who comprehend the Dao) know that all is united as one. Thus, they do not insist on their own views but lodge them in the common (only those who comprehend the Dao know that all things are fundamentally one, so they do not cling to their own rightness, hence \"do not use.\" Not using their own views, they merely align with the sentiments of the multitude, the common people, following the views of others). The common is the useful (to explain \"common\" as \"useful\"—to adopt the likes and dislikes of the multitude). The useful is the harmonious (by being useful, one harmonizes with the will of the multitude). The harmonious is the attained (one who can harmonize with the Dao attains effortless mastery; with such attainment, there is no clinging to right or wrong). To aptly attain is to approach the Dao (those who comprehend the Dao and aptly attain it draw near to the Dao).\n\nFollowing this is so (those who comprehend the unity of all things, though myriad changes arise, never lose the Dao—thus, there is nowhere they are not so. Following this \"so\" is true \"so\"). Yet not knowing why it is so is called the Dao (to reach a state where all is harmonized, right and wrong vanish, and one flows with things without attachment—this is called the Dao, following Laozi’s principle of the Dao as natural spontaneity).\n\nThis section emphasizes that to forget right and wrong, one must be a sage who comprehends the Dao, knowing all things as one body. Thus, there is no right or wrong, no situation that is impermissible, only natural spontaneity—this is called the Dao. After much elaboration and exposition, this finally points to the single word \"Dao.\" The *yi* in \"following this is so\" marks the utmost limit: the sage’s utmost limit is simply to accord with the natural Dao—nothing more. Accord with the Dao, and all naturally returns to unity.\n\nThe following text states that the foolish strive to force unity, yet ultimately fail to achieve it. They exhaust their spirit and intelligence in pursuit of unity, unaware of their inherent sameness—this is called \"morning three.\" What is \"morning three\"? It is said: The monkey keeper (one who feeds monkeys) distributed acorns, saying, \"Three in the morning and four in the evening.\" All the monkeys were angry (the monkeys insisted that mornings should have more, evenings less). He then said, \"Then four in the morning and three in the evening.\" All the monkeys were pleased (the keeper merely reversed the original numbers). Name and reality were unchanged, yet joy and anger were employed—this too follows the \"so\" (the names \"three\" and \"four\" were the same, and the actual numbers were unchanged, but the monkeys, clinging to their own views, took \"four in the morning\" as necessarily right. They did not examine the reality but merely rejoiced in the name. These are those who cannot forget right and wrong, like Boyi and Shuqi).\n\nThus, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong, resting in the celestial balance (the celestial balance is the naturally equal state, utterly free of right and wrong. As previously said, \"illuminated by heaven,\" this concludes with \"resting in the celestial balance\"). This is called \"walking both paths\" (to walk both paths means that what is right may be walked, and what is wrong may also be walked. When harmonized by the Dao, there is nothing that right and wrong cannot encompass).",

The Dao is realized in its course (to follow the Dao is to act without failing to accord with it. *Realized* and *naturally so* need not be distinguished). Things are called so and thus are so (what is called so is naturally so). How is it so? (What is the reason for its being so?)",

      "translated_text": "This passage speaks of those whose cultivation has not yet reached the state of naturalness, who forcibly strive to unify right and wrong, yet fail to awaken to the marvel of profound sameness. Such people can only affirm what they deem right but cannot forget what they deem wrong. They resemble Boyi, Shuqi, and Jiezi—though their conduct is lofty, they cannot escape a heart that resents the world and detests世俗. Likewise, the Confucians and Mohists each cling to one extreme as right, able only to approve what they approve, yet unable to approve what they disapprove. Though they depart from right and wrong, they ultimately cannot unify right and wrong. What they grasp is not inherently wrong, nor is it outside the Dao—only by each clinging to their own views as right do they become inverted. Thus, like the monkey keeper’s count of seven, where name and reality are the same, yet joy and anger arise differently, this is merely exhausting one’s spirit to force unity, unaware of the great sameness.\n\nOnly the sage harmonizes right and wrong, resting in the celestial balance, forgetting both and walking both paths. Thus, they can blend their light and move with the dust, merging without distinction—then there is nothing that can or cannot be done.\n\nThe following passage means: the ancients knew the state of original non-being and profound sameness, where right and wrong fundamentally did not exist. Later generations gradually declined. The ancients’ knowledge reached a certain point (the above spoke of those who do not know the Dao, exhausting their spirit to force unity yet ultimately failing. Thus, this speaks of the true persons of old, who possessed true knowledge in its ultimate state. \"Ultimate\" refers to the state of original non-being. The following provides evidence). Where does it reach? There are those who hold that there has never been any thing—this is the ultimate, the utmost, beyond which nothing can be added (before the state of original non-being, this is the utmost of the Dao, unknowable)! Next are those who acknowledge the existence of things yet have never established boundaries (though they have entered the realm of form, their knowledge remains uncarved, like the primordial chaos just divided, when human hearts were simple and unadorned—yet they had not yet established the boundaries of self and other. \"Boundaries\" refer to the divisions between this and that). Next are those who acknowledge boundaries yet have never established right and wrong (though they recognized divisions between self and other, their customs remained unrefined, and they had not yet developed the heart of right and wrong—thus they were not far from the Dao). The manifestation of right and wrong is the reason the Dao is diminished. The reason the Dao is diminished is the formation of attachment (attachment is private attachment to oneself. \"Formation\" refers to what was previously called \"once receiving its completed form\"—from then on, one strays from true nature, clings to this bodily form as the self, and thus the great Dao is greatly diminished). Is there truly completion and diminution? Is there truly no completion and diminution (if viewed from the perspective of the great Dao, is there truly completion and diminution? Without completion or diminution, if one truly sees that there is fundamentally no completion or diminution, then right and wrong naturally vanish)?\n\nThis passage explains that by straying from the great Dao, one forms the self, and once the self is formed, the Dao is diminished. Earlier, it was said, \"once receiving its completed form, one does not perish until its end\"—here, it finally reveals the word \"attachment\" as the root of self-clinging. By completing one’s own self, what is completed is small, and the great Dao is obscured, clarifying the earlier statement that \"the Dao is hidden in small completions.\" The following passage means: because what is completed is small, the people of the world toil endlessly throughout their lives yet never see their success. Thus, it illustrates this with three figures.\n\nBecause there is completion and diminution, Master Zhao played the zither (following the above, which said attachment forms and the Dao is diminished, it now shows that there is fundamentally no completion or diminution, thus citing three figures. Master Zhao was skilled at playing the zither, completing the legacy of his school; later, his son could not play the zither, diminishing the family’s reputation). Because there is no completion and diminution, Master Zhao did not play the zither (if he had not boldly established the reputation of playing the zither, then his son would not have had the story of diminishing the family’s reputation). Master Zhao’s playing of the zither, Shi Kuang’s guiding with his staff (further citing Shi Kuang as evidence. Shi Kuang, a man of great wisdom, was made blind and could not see the staff he used to guide himself—this is where completion and diminution arise), and Huizi’s leaning against the parasol tree (Huizi was a contemporary and friend of Zhuangzi, known for his eloquence and skill in debate. Zhuangzi’s meaning is that though Huizi’s debates were completed, the great Dao was diminished, thus comparing the completion and diminution of these two figures. To be skilled in debate yet not understand the Dao is like Shi Kuang’s wisdom yet blindness—even his son could not inherit his debating legacy, just as Master Zhao’s son could not play the zither)—the knowledge of these three nearly reached perfection, and thus their achievements were recorded in their later years (meaning they devoted themselves to their pursuits until the end of their lives). Only because they cherished their pursuits did they differ from others (speaking of the three figures’ deep devotion, which set them apart from others). Because they cherished their pursuits, they wished to make them known. Others (speaking of those who admired the knowledge of the three figures, while the three believed themselves to be ultimate and wished to display their abilities to others, meaning to teach them) sought to illuminate what could not be illuminated, and thus ended their lives in the obscurity of \"hard and white\" (this sentence refers specifically to Huizi, who had not truly understood the Dao yet forcibly claimed to understand it, and further sought to illuminate it for others—thus he achieved no great success and ended his life in the obscurity of \"hard and white\"). And his son ended with the threads of Zhao’s zither (the above spoke of Huizi’s completion and diminution; this speaks of Master Zhao’s completion and diminution)—his life achieved nothing (Huizi ended in the obscurity of \"hard and white,\" thus his life achieved nothing).",

      "translated_text": "The son of Master Zhao learned his father’s zither, yet likewise ended his life without achievement. If Huizi did not engage in disputation and Master Zhao did not play the zither, what completion or diminution could there have been? The reason their Way was diminished lay precisely in their small achievements. If this can be called completion, then even I, too, am complete. If this cannot be called completion, then neither things nor I have achieved anything.\n\nThus, the radiance of perplexing doubt is what the sage contemplates—this \"radiance\" refers to concealing one’s brilliance and blending with the dust, echoing Laozi’s \"dim and murky,\" meaning to harmonize with the world without flaunting one’s views. To shine without dazzling is what the sage seeks. It is not that he does not employ his wisdom, but rather lodges it in the commonplace. This is what is meant by \"illuminating with clarity.\"\n\nThis passage concludes a far-reaching intent. From the opening \"speech is not mere breath\" downward, through \"where is the Dao hidden that there is truth and falsehood?\"—where the Dao is obscured by small achievements and words are concealed by splendor—even to the point of affirming what one denies and denying what one affirms, the argument rises in layers. The first culminates in \"nothing is better than clarity.\" The second, from the pivot of the Dao attaining the center of the ring, again concludes with \"nothing is better than clarity.\" Next, the analogy of the horse is introduced to illustrate that the Dao is universally interconnected, leading to the assertion that only the enlightened know this unity. Then, by not employing one’s views but lodging them in the ordinary, the character of the Dao is subtly revealed. The passage then borrows the example of the monkey-keeper, whose name and reality were not diminished, to expound upon the theme of diminution. The diminution of the Dao arises from the completion of attachment. This phrase, \"the completion of attachment,\" reaches back to the earlier assertion that \"once one receives one’s completed form\" and \"follows one’s completed mind as a teacher.\" The two meanings of \"completion\" imply: if one receives one’s form, this is the completion of attachment, and thus the Dao is diminished—here there is both completion and diminution. But if one follows one’s completed mind as a teacher, then there is fundamentally no completion or diminution. It is because of the completion of form that the distinctions of right and wrong become manifest—this is the root of it. Thus, the two ideas of \"completed form\" and \"completed mind\" form the backbone of the argument. The obscuring of the Dao by small achievements and the concealment of words by splendor have long existed, all stemming from a failure to awaken to the great Dao. Therefore, it was first declared: \"nothing is better than clarity.\" Then, discussing the pivot of the Dao, it was again said: \"thus, nothing is better than clarity.\" Now, having argued to the end, the conclusion returns to completion and diminution, pointing out that Huizi was the foremost among the unenlightened, clinging to the disputation of \"hard and white\" and obscuring his entire life. Thus, in the end, it highlights the sage who embodies the \"radiance of perplexing doubt\"—one who does not insist on being right—and returns to the enlightened one who does not employ his views but lodges them in the ordinary. This concludes with: \"this is what is meant by 'nothing is better than clarity.'\" The text, beginning from \"speech is not mere breath,\" spans over seven hundred characters before reaching this grand conclusion. Its words and meaning are like a snake in the grass—only its undulations and meanderings are visible, while its form remains elusive. Without a true eye, it cannot be easily discerned.\n\nAs for the completion and diminution of the three masters: Master Zhao’s pertains to the completion and diminution of his craft; Master Kuang’s, to the completion and diminution of his form; and Huizi’s, to the completion and diminution of the Dao. The overarching conclusion is that the Dao is obscured by small achievements and words are concealed by splendor, ultimately returning to the sage. This sage is the one previously described as \"only the enlightened know the universal interconnectedness\" and \"not employing one’s views but lodging them in the ordinary.\" Gazing deeply, one perceives the boundless waves and vital currents of this old master’s prose, where its intricacies defy grasp. The phrase \"this is what is meant by 'nothing is better than clarity'\" concludes the chapter beginning with \"speech is not mere breath.\" From here, the discussion shifts to the sage who embodies \"perplexing doubt,\" launching into the theme of the sage’s absence of right and wrong, leading to the following passage: \"without preference, following what is so\"—over two hundred and thirty characters forming another chapter.\n\nNow, suppose there is someone who speaks thus—do his words resemble this kind? By \"this,\" I refer to the sage of \"perplexing doubt,\" who is without right or wrong. Does this speaker’s discourse resemble such a sage? Or does it not? Whether it resembles or does not resemble, if one joins with it as a kind, then it differs in no way from that sage. Here, \"that\" refers to the sage mentioned above.

      "translated_text": "There is that which has a beginning (this refers to Laozi’s \"The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth\"), there is that which has not yet had a beginning (here, even \"having a beginning\" is absent—meaning \"without beginning.\" This corresponds to Laozi’s \"These two emerge together but differ in name\"), and there is that which has not yet had \"that which has not yet had a beginning\" (here, even \"not yet having\" is absent, corresponding to Laozi’s \"Mystery upon mystery—the gateway of all subtleties.\" This speaks solely of the origin of the formless Dao).\n\nThere is that which is \"having\" (this \"having\" refers to heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things, as in Laozi’s \"The named is the mother of the ten thousand things\"), there is that which is \"non-having\" (from the existence of heaven and earth, one infers \"The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.\" This is to trace from the formed back to the formless origin of the Dao), there is that which has not yet had \"non-having\" (this means that the formed heaven, earth, and ten thousand things arise from the formless, yet within the essence of the Dao, neither \"having\" nor \"non-having\" is established, hence it is said \"not yet had\"), and there is that which has not yet had \"that which has not yet had non-having\" (the above speaks of both \"having\" and \"non-having\" as absent; here, even \"both absent\" is absent, utterly beyond all designation. Only then does one reach the realm of the Dao’s profound sameness, thus naming it the wondrous Dao of emptiness and non-being).\n\nSuddenly, there is \"having\" and \"non-having\" (within the essence of the Dao, there are no names or forms, not a single dharma established—hence it is forcibly called the vast and empty Dao. Yet suddenly, \"having\" and \"non-having\" arise, and none know what causes this. Earlier, it was said, \"as if there were a true master,\" yet one cannot discern its traces. Now, turning back to reflect, it subtly points to this), yet it remains unknown whether \"having\" and \"non-having\" are truly \"having\" or \"non-having\" (within the essence of the Dao, neither \"having\" nor \"non-having\" is established. Even now, who causes them to be \"having\" or \"non-having\"? This is what was meant by \"as if there were a true master,\" yet its traces cannot be found. Now, upon returning to observe this, even \"having\" and \"non-having\" are absent—how then could there be any debate over right and wrong?).\n\nNow, I have already spoken (if \"having\" and \"non-having\" are both absent, all names and forms are extinguished—how could there be any debate through words? Yet I have already spoken within the realm of wordlessness, though my words are fundamentally without words), yet it remains unknown whether what I have called \"speaking\" is truly speaking or truly not speaking (I have now already spoken, but my words are merely words of wordlessness, as in the earlier example of the fledgling’s cry, which arises from the celestial mechanism without any trace of right or wrong. People see only my wordless words—are they truly words? Or truly not words? If one awakens to these wordless words, then right and wrong naturally vanish).\n\nThe preceding explanation of words was not like the wind’s blowing—it was speech arising from a calculating mind. Now, Zhuangzi has spoken of the state of forgetting words and attaining profound sameness, meaning that though I have now spoken, my words arise from the true master and are words of wordlessness. If one comprehends my wordless words, then one forgets words and returns to unity.\n\nThe following passage further explains forgetting words and returning to unity, where great and small are the same, and right and wrong are utterly absent. Only thus is it truly so.\n\nIn the world, nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; nothing lives longer than an infant who dies young, yet Pengzu is short-lived (these two lines are exceedingly difficult to grasp. Having already discussed returning to the origin of the Dao, Zhuangzi now unifies right and wrong through the Dao. If one observes the formed through the formed, then great and small, long life and early death are fixed and unchangeable. But if one observes the formed through the Dao, then an autumn hair, though small, embodies the vastness of the void, while Mount Tai, though formed, is but a pebble within it. Thus, nothing is greater than an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small. An infant who dies young, though short-lived, shares the same origin as the beginningless, while Pengzu is but a single thing within it. Thus, nothing lives longer than an infant who dies young, yet Pengzu is short-lived. If one observes thus through the Dao, then the small is not small, and the great is not great; the short-lived is not short-lived, and the long-lived is not long-lived. In this way, heaven and earth share the same root, and the ten thousand things are one body—how could there be right and wrong?).\n\nHeaven and earth are born together with me, and the ten thousand things and I are one (observing through the Dao, the ten thousand things are one body, thus heaven and earth are born together with me, and the ten thousand things and I are one). Since we are already one, can there be speech? (Having become one, self and things are both forgotten—what more is there to say?) Since we have already called it \"one,\" can there be no speech? (Having already named it \"one,\" how could words not arise?) The one and words make two (the formless \"one\" is now named \"one,\" thus two \"ones\" become two), and two and one make three (now, with words describing these two \"ones,\" they become three through mutual dependence). From this point onward, even the most skilled mathematician cannot reckon it—how much less the ordinary person! (From the mutual dependence of words to become three, dependence continues endlessly. Even one skilled in calculation cannot exhaust it—how much less the ordinary person!)\n\nThus, from non-being to being, one reaches three—how much more from being to being! (From non-being just reaching being, one has already become three—how much more from being to being, which is boundless!) Do not proceed thus, but rest here (not proceeding means settling the mind before \"not yet having\" began, where it remains serene, constant, and unchanging. Earlier, it was said that the multitude follow \"this\" and thus have right and wrong, while the sage does not follow but illuminates it through heaven—this is also \"resting here.\" Thus, carrying the discussion to before \"not yet having things,\" heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things merge into one, never departing from the Dao. Only this is truly so).",

      "translated_text": "The sage who \"follows this\" does so by taking non-proceeding as \"this\"—this is precisely illuminating it through heaven. (Here lies the textual correspondence!)\n\nThis passage elucidates the wondrous union with the mysterious, the shared root of heaven and earth, and the oneness of the ten thousand things. Settling the mind in the great Dao, without arising distinctions, one is utterly free from right and wrong—this alone is true. Thus it concludes: \"Do not proceed thus, but rest here.\"\n\nBelow, the text again raises the word \"this,\" the root of right and wrong. The Dao has never had boundaries (it originally lacks form or distinctions between self and others), nor has it ever had constancy (constancy here means rigid fixation, the source of right-and-wrong assertions. Following the Dao in speech, there is no \"can\" or \"cannot,\" no fixed right or wrong). Yet by taking \"this\" as real, boundaries arise (merely grasping a single \"this\" gives rise to the distinctions of right and wrong).\n\nLet us speak of these boundaries: there is left and right, there are relationships and righteousness, there are divisions and debates, there are competitions and conflicts—these are called the eight virtues (meaning that from non-being to being, the duality of being and non-being already forms opposition. Once being exists, there arises the order of left and right; with left and right, there are relationships and righteousness; with relationships and righteousness, there are divisions and debates; and from these, competitions and conflicts emerge. These arise in succession, fixed and unchanging. The root of the illness lies in the single word \"this\"—for example, taking left as right makes right utterly unchangeable. Worldly sentiments regard such distinctions as skill, hence calling them the eight virtues. Here, \"virtue\" means capability).\n\nEarlier, the discussion moved from delusion to awakening, reaching the root of the great Dao, and the phrase \"rest here\" concluded it. Here, it raises the point again: the great Dao originally has no right or wrong—how do these distinctions and attachments arise? It merely points to the word \"this\" as the root of the illness, urging people to see through it.\n\nBeyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss (the Dao encompasses heaven and earth, sharing the same body as the great void, originally without boundaries. Only because the multitude are deluded by the great Dao and cling to their own views as right do the debates of right and wrong arise. The sage’s mind merges with the Dao, so even beyond the six directions, they are not unaware; yet they preserve it without discussion, for it lies beyond the reach of ears and eyes, lest right and wrong arise). Within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not debate (within the six directions, the sage does not fail to comprehend all things, but only discusses their great principles—such as the heavenly constants and earthly duties—to establish the order of ruler and minister, father and child, without debating their details).\n\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* governs the world, embodying the intent of the former kings; the sage debates but does not argue (the *Spring and Autumn* serves as the great canon and law for governing the world’s rulers, ministers, fathers, and children. The sage merely debates the details of names and ranks without arguing the intricacies of right and wrong).\n\nThus, where there is division, there is also non-division (the Dao is one alone, originally undivided. Yet within the formed world of heaven and earth, the order of human relationships cannot but be divided. Though people and things are divided, the Dao is never divided—what is called \"nature is one alone\"). Where there is debate, there is also non-debate (though the world has countless debates, there are things that cannot be debated, for the great Dao of wordless understanding resides therein).\n\nWhy is this so? The sage embraces it (the sage is one with the Dao, clearly knowing the multiplicity of transformations yet never dividing them; clearly knowing the debates of many mouths, yet the Dao cannot be reached by words. Thus, they conceal their brilliance and hold it in their hearts without displaying it to others). The multitude debate it to display to one another (the multitude, in truth, have not grasped the origin of the great Dao, yet they feign knowledge, clinging to their own views as necessarily right, and with clamorous debates, boast to others—thus the great Dao is obscured).\n\nThus it is said: those who debate do not see (this quotes an ancient saying. Laozi said: \"The good do not debate; those who debate are not good\").\n\nThis passage explains that the sage who dissolves doubts is one with the Dao, reaching \"do not proceed thus, but rest here.\" It means the sage’s mind is like the great void: though they do not fail to know the affairs within and beyond the six directions, they embrace it without debate, revealing that those who love debate have not truly understood the great Dao. Below, the text further explains the meaning of non-speech and non-debate.\n\nThe great Dao cannot be named (the Dao originally has no name, so it cannot be designated). Great debate does not speak (the debate of non-speech makes right and wrong clear). Great benevolence is not benevolent (it is not a matter of deliberately being benevolent). Great integrity is not boastful (boastful means full. It does not take integrity as a source of pride). Great courage does not harm (harm means injury. Great courage arises from preserving the power of the Dao, not from injuring others).\n\nWhen the Dao is made manifest, it is no longer the Dao (when the great Dao is made evident, speech departs from it). When words debate, they do not reach it (the Dao is originally beyond words; even with verbal debates, they cannot attain it). Benevolence, when constant, does not succeed (if benevolence is constantly held with intent, it becomes partial love, thus failing to fully accomplish the ten thousand things). Integrity, when pure, is not trustworthy (trustworthy means real. To stand out with purity for the sake of reputation is to lack true virtue). Courage, when harmful, does not succeed (if courage harbors intent to harm others, it is mere blood and qi, not the courage of Dao and righteousness).\n\nThese five, though rounded, nearly verge on the square (though these five names may be practiced in the world, as they all arise from intent, they ultimately cannot be realized—thus they nearly verge on the square).",

If one can know this, it is called the Heavenly Treasury (to say that the realm of the unknown is the origin of the great Dao—here, there is fundamentally no debate or discourse.

Thus, the waters of heaven and earth arise within it, yet it is never filled); draw from it, yet it never runs dry (even if heaven and earth draw from it, it is never exhausted). Yet one does not know whence it comes (this is what is meant by \"empty yet inexhaustible, active yet ever-flowing, yet one does not know its source\")—this is called \"preserving the light\" (to preserve is to conceal without revealing. Earlier, it spoke of \"the radiance of doubt and confusion, which the sage takes as his model\"—here, it concludes by pointing to its meaning, saying this is called \"preserving the light\").\n\nEarlier, it spoke of \"the radiance of doubt and confusion, which the sage takes as his model,\" and thus presented matters within the six directions, both inner and outer. The sage knows all things but does not speak of them, for the great Dao is originally without knowledge or debate. The sage abides in the vast emptiness, roaming through the human world, harmonizing his light with the dust, shining yet not dazzling—this is called \"preserving the light.\" The sage’s work must reach this point to be complete, and thus it is said to be what the sage takes as his model.\n\nTherefore, long ago, Yao asked Shun: \"I wish to attack the states of Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao. Yet when I face south, I feel unsettled. What is the reason?\" (This \"unsettled\" means that in his heart, he was determined to attack them, yet afterward, he could not let it go, not knowing why.) Shun replied: \"Those three rulers dwell among the mugwort and reeds. Why should you feel unsettled? (This means Yao’s heart was not broad enough to embrace all things. Moreover, the three rulers occupied such humble positions, like mugwort and reeds, that they should not have troubled his heart. If you feel unsettled, why not expand yourself?) Long ago, when ten suns appeared together, all things were illuminated—how much more so for one whose virtue surpasses the sun? (This means Yao’s virtue had not yet reached its fullness. When ten suns appeared together, their light was vast and bright, illuminating all things—how much more so for one whose virtue surpasses the sun? If one’s virtue were already perfected, it would be vast and luminous, embracing all things—how could the insignificance of those three rulers trouble him?)\"\n\nThis illustrates that the sage who preserves the light has a heart as vast as the Heavenly Treasury—what the sage takes as his model is achieved only when his work reaches this point. If one’s work has not yet reached this level, the heart is not broad and cannot embrace all things. Thus, even the great sage Yao had his shortcomings. The image of ten suns appearing together serves as a metaphor for advancing virtue, summarizing the preceding meaning and concluding the intent from \"words are not like the wind\" onward.\n\nThe following passage reaffirms that the perfected one halts at what he does not know, revealing the sage’s accomplishment, and concludes with \"death and life do not alter him—how much less the beginnings of profit and harm?\"\n\nNie Que asked Wang Ni: \"Do you know what all things agree upon as right?\" He replied: \"How would I know?\" \"Do you know what you do not know?\" He replied: \"How would I know?\" \"Then do things have no knowledge?\" He replied: \"How would I know? Nevertheless, let me try to speak of it. How do I know that what I call knowing (this knowing is the knowledge of ordinary people) is not not-knowing? How do I know that what I call not-knowing (my not-knowing) is not knowing? (Does the sage’s knowing fundamentally differ from that of ordinary people? Yet ordinary people, habituated to delusive knowledge, cling to their own views as right—none of it is true knowledge.)\"",

Though great marshes burn, they cannot be scorched; though rivers and lakes freeze, they cannot be chilled; though thunder splits mountains and gales shake the seas, they cannot be startled.

This old man’s heart has long known of the Buddha, certain that later ages would inevitably confirm his words. If not, then who else could be called \"the Great Awakened One\"?)\n\nThis passage clarifies how the perfected person transcends life and death to wander among the world: by seeing the world as a great dream, death and life as night and day, sorrow and joy as dream-events. Within delusion, debating right and wrong is like interpreting dreams in a dream; within delusion, what is taken for right and wrong is like recounting dream-events in broad daylight. In sum, all remains within the great dream. Without the perfected person’s insight, who would recognize this as the great dream? Fools secretly take themselves for the awakened—how shallow they are! Even the ancient sage-kings from Yao and Shun onward, along with their ministers, and Confucius himself, were but dreamers speaking in dreams.

Thus, neither you nor I nor anyone else can know—must we then wait for another?\"\n\n\"What does it mean to harmonize with the heavenly equilibrium?\"\n\"It means: 'Is it so? Is it not so? So or not so.' If 'so' is truly so, then its difference from 'not so' requires no debate; if 'so' is truly so, then 'so' differing from 'not so' likewise requires no debate. The mutual dependence of changing voices—whether they depend on each other or not—harmonize with the heavenly equilibrium, following the boundless flow to exhaust the years.

      "translated_text": "Thus, those who cling to the view of self and engage in contentious debates over right and wrong do so due to the error of delusion. Therefore, what follows points directly to the true master, urging one first to awaken to one’s original reality; to awaken to this original reality, one must first cast aside the bodily form. Hence the mention of the \"hundred bones and nine orifices,\" guiding one to see through the bodily form and recognize the true master. If one awakens to the true master, then naturally every word spoken aligns with the Dao, all arising from the celestial truth—this is what is called the heavenly wind. The inconsistencies in today’s debates stem from the words of the calculating mind, thus clinging to right and wrong. Therefore, the opening of the discourse on right and wrong begins with the phrase, *\"Now, words are not the blowing [of wind]\"*—raising this to generate the many subsequent descriptions of right and wrong, all unfolding from the two characters \"not blowing.\" Yet while ordinary people remain deluded and unawakened, the sage, having already awakened, is not swayed by the right and wrong of the multitude. Thus, whatever is spoken is reflected in heaven and earth. From this phrase, *\"reflected in heaven,\"* the public case for awakening is established. Hence, what follows argues that right and wrong need not be forcibly unified; one need only rest in the celestial balance, and without effort, all will naturally align. Through layer upon layer of discussion, it reaches the conclusion that in the end, no one can truly settle right and wrong. Like all the world, past and present, it is but a dream within a dream—only the great awakened sage can set it right. Even if one cannot await the great awakened sage, one need only realize the true master within each person, and the judgments of things and distinctions of right and wrong will become clear. Upon this awakening, right and wrong clarify themselves. Then, whatever is spoken arises from the celestial truth, no different from the earthly wind. Thus, the conclusion is drawn with the phrase *\"responding with transforming sounds.\"*\n\nIf one has not yet fully awakened, then whatever is spoken should be reflected in heaven, and the work lies in resting in the celestial balance. Hence, the closing words: *\"harmonizing with the celestial boundary.\"* This is the vital pulse and fundamental intent of the entire discourse. Yet the waves of the text surge boundlessly, making its depths difficult to fathom. If one can grasp its central meaning, then from beginning to end, it is coherent, rigorously structured, and not a single word is superfluous. This is what is meant by the *\"divine transformations of literature, like spirits and ghosts.\"*\n\nThe following section concludes with form, shadow, and dream as metaphors to reveal the true work of cultivation. The shadow’s shadow (the shadow beyond the shadow) asks the shadow: *\"Before, you were walking, now you are still; before, you were sitting, now you are rising. Why do you lack constancy?\"* (meaning, why is there no fixed principle in your movements of walking, stopping, sitting, and rising). The shadow replies: *\"Is it because I depend on something to be this way? Does what I depend on also depend on something else to be this way? Do I depend on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada?\"* (meaning, what I depend on is form, like the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada—mere things. What do they know?) *\"How could I know why it is so? How could I know why it is not so?\"* (meaning, that borrowed form is like an insensate clod, no different from a snake’s scales or a cicada’s wings, having nothing to do with the true master—it simply follows the movement of the celestial mechanism. How could one know whether it is so or not? The implication is that those who study the Dao and practice the work of forgetting the self must first observe this body as a shadow, like a snake’s scales or a cicada’s wings, and the attachment to self will naturally dissolve.)\n\nIn the past, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering happily as a butterfly. He was so content that he forgot he was Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, sprawled as Zhou. But was it Zhou who dreamed he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming it was Zhou? Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. (This speaks of the difference between dream and waking, yet it is all Zhou. How could the butterfly be Zhou, or Zhou the butterfly? Here, there must be clarity—one must see through this to regard life and death as dream and waking, and all things as one, thus eliminating the debates over right and wrong.) This is called *\"the transformation of things\"* (the transformation of things means all things merge into one. As it is said, *\"Great transformation is called sageliness\"*—the ultimate in aligning things can only be achieved by the sage of great transformation. When the myriad things blend and transform into one, then all distinctions of self and other, right and wrong vanish, and the inconsistencies of judgments naturally align. The alignment of things concludes with the metaphor of a dream, shattering the great dream of all the world, past and present. From this, we see that Zhuangzi’s learning is not easily attained—it is not merely about the text.)\n\nThis concludes the ultimate transformation in the alignment of things, thus presenting the indistinction of dream and waking, with the transformation of things as the highest principle. The general intent of this discourse is that to align things, one must first break the attachment to self as the foremost task. Hence, it begins with *\"I have lost my self.\"* Here, *\"I\"* refers to the true master, while *\"self\"* is the bodily form. Initially, it speaks of forgetting the self, not yet addressing the work; next, the work of forgetting the self requires observing that the bodily form is illusory, seeing through the hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera one by one, scattering them all—within them, who is truly the self? Only then is the true lord revealed. The implication is that if one awakens to the true lord, then the bodily form can be transcended; with the bodily form transcended, the self is naturally forgotten...\n\n[2 pages missing]\n\n**Chapter Three: The Preservation of Life**\n\nMy life has limits, but knowledge is without limit. To pursue the limitless with the limited is perilous! And to do so while already knowing this is perilous indeed! In doing good, avoid seeking fame; in doing evil, avoid approaching punishment.

      "translated_text": "This \"Nurturing the Life-Principle\" chapter establishes its meaning through the single episode of Butcher Ding’s dissection of an ox, which fully embodies the subtleties of nurturing life—nothing more than a grand metaphor. If one aligns each element precisely, its marvel becomes evident.\n\nButcher Ding represents the sage; the ox, the affairs of the world. From the vastness of the realm and the state to the minutiae of daily conduct, all are matters before one’s eyes. The skill of dissecting the ox is the art and wisdom of governing the realm, the state, and engaging with the world. The knife symbolizes one’s original nature, the master of life—acting in accord with one’s nature is like using the knife to dissect the ox.\n\nIt speaks of the sage who studies the Dao, awakening subtly to the truth of nature, then extending its threads to govern the realm and state, just as Butcher Ding first learned the Dao before applying it to his craft. Before awakening, one sees only conflict with the world, difficult to navigate—like Butcher Ding, who at first saw nothing but the whole ox. Yet as one deepens in the Dao and the wisdom of nature grows clearer, the affairs of the world are seen through, each possessing its own inherent, natural principle. Thus, no single matter appears before one as an obstacle, and \"the eye no longer sees the whole ox.\"\n\nHaving seen through worldly affairs, one acts solely in accord with Heaven’s principle, finding no difficulty whatsoever—this is what is meant by \"never encountering the knots of sinew and bone.\" By proceeding in harmony with principle, one avoids the exhausting pursuit of gain that harms the truth of one’s nature. Thus, like the knife’s edge after nineteen years, it remains as if newly whetted, entirely free from the slightest nick or flaw.\n\nWith the sage’s clarity and discerning wisdom applied to matters that accord with principle, even small tasks are met with vast capacity—like the blade gliding through ample space. If one encounters difficult, unprincipled matters, like tangled knots of sinew and bone, one need only proceed with caution, deliberating carefully, and they too will be easily resolved, their difficulty no longer apparent.\n\nHow could one so attuned to the world be wearied and worn, inviting harm to life and nature? Thus, the chapter concludes: \"From Butcher Ding’s words, I have learned how to nurture life.\" The intent lies in the sage’s alignment with nature, acting without excess, thereby preserving one’s nature and sparing the body from harm. One must deeply grasp this meaning, transcending the words themselves.\n\nSuch metaphors are found only in Buddhist sutras; they are utterly absent from secular texts, making them all the more worthy of careful reflection, for they contain profound significance.\n\nThe following passage speaks of those who fail to nurture life:\n\nGongwen Xuan, upon seeing the Chamberlain Right (an official title, referring to a one-legged man), exclaimed in shock, “What manner of man is this? How did he lose his foot? Was it Heaven’s doing, or man’s?” He replied, “It was Heaven, not man. Heaven gave him life to stand alone (meaning the Chamberlain Right was born with desires that corrupted his Heaven-endowed nature, thus incurring the punishment of amputation—Heaven’s penalty, leaving him solitary). Man’s form is bestowed by Heaven. Knowing this, one sees that his loss of a foot was Heaven’s doing, not man’s.”\n\nA marsh pheasant takes ten steps to peck, a hundred steps to drink, yet does not seek to be caged. Though its spirit may thrive, it finds no goodness in such confinement (the pheasant, though its sustenance is hard-won, willingly follows its nature and refuses to be kept in a pen. Though the pen’s provisions may nourish its spirit, it knows the suffering of constraint and finds no comfort in it, thus rejecting it. The Chamberlain Right, greedy and heedless of his form, was far inferior to the marsh pheasant. Thus, his amputation was truly Heaven’s punishment, though he remained unaware).\n\nThis passage speaks of those who fail to nurture life: they lose sight of their true nature, forget their form in pursuit of gain, and bring harm to life and spirit upon themselves, far less attuned than the marsh pheasant.\n\nNext, it speaks of even sages who, if they cannot forget emotion, also lose their Heaven-endowed nature. Thus, it invokes Laozi to illustrate:\n\nWhen Lao Dan died, Qin Shi came to offer condolences. He wailed three times and departed (showing no deep grief). His disciples asked, “Was he not your friend?” “Indeed,” he replied. “Then is it proper to offer condolences in such a manner?” they asked. “Yes,” he said. “At first, I thought him a true person (meaning when I first befriended him, I believed him to be one who had attained the Dao), but now I see he was not (after his death, I realized he had not). When I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping for him as if for their own children, and the young weeping as if for their mothers. Those who gathered to mourn must have shared unspoken bonds with him, their hearts unable to restrain themselves—thus their grief, though unsummoned, was so profound. This is fleeing from Heaven and doubling back on emotion, forgetting what one has received. The ancients called this ‘the punishment of fleeing from Heaven’ (punishment here means principle). Lao Dan, in his conduct, could not forget emotion while in the world, thus forming attachments to others, who in turn could not forget him.”",

      "translated_text": "This is truly self-fleeing from Heavenly truth, forgetting one’s original endowment. The ancients called this ‘fleeing and losing Heavenly truth, injuring one’s nature’—such a one is no sage.\n\nAs for coming, Master, it was timely (to come into being is to follow the time); as for going, Master, it was in accord (to depart in death is the transformation of creation. Yet the Heavenly truth remains serene, never having known coming or going, life or death). Abiding by the time and dwelling in accord, sorrow and joy cannot enter (to live is to rest in one’s time; to die is to follow transformation—how then could death bring sorrow or life bring joy? For one who grasps the fundamental absence of life and death). The ancients called this ‘the Great Clod’s suspended release’ (the Great Clod is the lord of life. Nature is bound to form, like a man hung upside down. Now, transcending and following transformation, one releases nature from its suspension).\n\nThe point exhausts itself in being firewood, yet the fire is transmitted—one knows not its end (though form transforms, nature endures, like firewood consumed yet fire remaining. There is luminous mutuality, like firewood and fire passing on. Thus life is ceaselessly generated, transformation is without end. Like the transmission of firewood and fire, one knows not its exhaustion). This speaks of nature receiving its nourishment, so that Heavenly truth is preserved whole—then coming and going, life and death, are utterly without constraint. Thus the perfected one wanders in the world: though his form is the same as others’, his nature transcends things beyond, unaltered by the changes of life and death. This is truly due to having attained its proper nourishment. To nourish nature and restore truth is to be a true person.\n\nThus, in \"Among the World of Men,\" it speaks of the true person wandering without intent, using the analogy of Cook Ding carving an ox to show the effect of nourishing life’s master. Though the chapters differ, their meaning is fundamentally connected.\n\n\"Among the World of Men\"\nThis chapter expounds the Dao of the sage in the world. Yet \"Nourishing Life’s Master\" teaches not to harm life with worldly affairs, and the effort of nourishing life is gained through experiencing the world. If one can truly nourish oneself, then in engaging the world, one will naturally avoid the faults of flaunting talent, seeking fame, or forcing action without cause. In assisting a ruler or serving a command, one will avoid the suspicion of boasting of merit or exaggerating virtue. And this effort—through fasting of the mind, sitting in forgetfulness, and engaging the world with emptiness—can be free from harm.\n\nIt speaks at length of the difficulty of worldly affairs and human feelings: unless one is empty and awaits things, even a slight talent or desire for fame will inevitably lead to harm. Thus the chapter concludes that \"lack of talent\" is the ultimate principle. Only when one engages the world without harm does the mastery of nourishing life become evident, mutually illuminating the previous chapter.\n\nConfucius was a sage who served the world, and Yan Hui was the foremost disciple of the sagely gate—thus they are invoked to lend weight, making the teaching credible.\n\nYan Hui sought an audience with Zhongni and asked to depart.\n“Where are you going?” (Zhongni asked where he intended to go.)\n“I am going to Wei.”\n“What for?” (The implication being that even a humane person like Yan Hui should not force action without cause.)\n“I have heard,” said Yan Hui, “that the Lord of Wei (Kuaikui) is in his prime (in the vigor of his years), and his conduct is solitary (he is harsh, self-willed, rejects remonstrance, and acts recklessly). He treats his state lightly and does not see his faults (he is heedless and dismissive of his state, unaware of his errors). He treats the deaths of his people lightly (he is indifferent to the people, so the dead are many), and the dead are measured by the state as if a marsh, like reeds (the dead are heaped like reeds in a marsh when the state is compared to a marsh)—the people have nowhere to turn (the people are distressed, with nowhere to appeal).\n\nI once heard you say, Master: ‘Leave a well-ordered state (if a state is well-governed, do not seek office without merit); go to a disordered state (to quell disorder and support the endangered is to bring peace to the people). The gate of a physician has many sick’ (those who are good at saving their time are like a good physician whose gate has many sick people). I wish to apply what I have heard and consider its principles (Yan Hui had long heard the Master’s words, so he wished to apply what he had heard and consider its methods), hoping that the state might be cured (hoping to relieve the people of their suffering).”\n\nZhongni said, “Alas! You will likely go and suffer punishment! The Dao does not desire mixture (to study the Dao, one must focus the mind single-mindedly; one cannot allow the mind to be disordered). Mixture leads to multiplicity, multiplicity to disturbance, disturbance to sorrow, and sorrow cannot be saved (if the mind is cluttered, one disturbs oneself with many affairs; disturbance leads to sorrow, and sorrow cannot be remedied).\n\nThe utmost person of old first established it in himself before establishing it in others (the utmost person of old, in engaging the world, first established the Dao and virtue in himself, then applied what he had established to others. These two lines are the great principle of engaging the world—none but the Master could attain this). If what is established in oneself is not settled, how can one have leisure to reach the conduct of violent men? Moreover, do you know where virtue is scattered and whence knowledge emerges? Virtue is scattered by fame, and knowledge emerges from contention (virtue cannot be preserved because of fame’s scattering; when fame scatters, substance is diminished. Knowledge that is revealed externally provokes the beginning of contention).”",
      "overlap_context": " Those who gathered to mourn must have shared unspoken bonds with him, their hearts unable to restrain themselves—thus their grief, though unsummoned, was so profound. This is fleeing from Heaven and doubling back on emotion, forgetting what one has received. The ancients called this ‘the punishment of fleeing from Heaven’ (punishment here means principle). Lao Dan, in his conduct, could not forget emotion while in the world, thus forming attachments to others, who in turn could not forget him.”",

      "translated_text": "Names are mechanisms of mutual grinding (the sound of a machine’s grinding—names are what people use to jostle one another, none able to claim sole possession). Knowledge is the tool of contention (once talent or knowledge is revealed, everyone envies it, leading to strife and unrest). These two are instruments of misfortune, not to be fully deployed (talent and virtue, knowledge and skill—these are the seeds of calamity, instruments of harm; how can they be put into full practice?).\n\nMoreover, when virtue is deep and trust is firm (solid and unshakable), it may not yet align with another’s qi (if I apply deep virtue and steadfast trust to others, I must first gauge whether their qi harmonizes with mine). When fame is known but not contested, it may not yet reach another’s heart (though I do not contend for fame, I have not yet penetrated the other’s mind to know whether they trust me). To forcibly display before violent men the language of benevolence, righteousness, and the carpenter’s inked line—this is to make others resent what they perceive as one’s own beauty, and it is called \"bringing harm to others.\" One who harms others will inevitably be harmed in return. You risk becoming a harmer of others (though you act with firm trust and humble yourself before them, you have not yet discerned their qi or reached their heart, yet you press upon them the language of benevolence, righteousness, and the carpenter’s line. You may suddenly arouse suspicion and disbelief, leading them to think you are exposing their faults to highlight your own virtue. This is what it means to lack trust and thus invite slander. Such is called bringing harm to others. All who harm others will be harmed in return. If you do not carefully assess them before acting, you will likely be harmed by them).\n\nFurthermore, if a ruler truly delights in the worthy and despises the unworthy, what need has he for you to seek distinction (if the Lord of Wei genuinely values worthiness and rejects unworthiness, his state already has worthy men—why must you go forth to display your difference)? If you go unbidden (if you insist on going without being summoned), the lords will surely exploit their power to vie for victory (if you go without a royal summons, those lords will use their authority to compete with you, refusing your counsel). Your eyes will be dazzled (faced with the lord’s imposing power, you will lose your composure, your gaze bewildered), your complexion will flatten (once your eyes are dazzled, you will seek to recover, your expression smoothing into appeasement), your mouth will babble (with your demeanor already lost, your words will stammer in self-defense), your bearing will conform (once your appearance and words falter, your whole body will unconsciously yield and adapt), and your heart will complete it (with your outward demeanor lost, your inner resolve will abandon itself, reinforcing their faults). This is like using fire to fight fire, water to fight water—it is called \"increasing the excess\" (your initial intent was to correct their faults, yet you end up reinforcing them, like using fire or water to combat fire or water, only multiplying the harm). To follow the beginning without end (if you begin by yielding, their faults will know no limit)—you risk, by offering unsolicited earnest words, meeting your death before violent men (if they do not trust you yet you press deep counsel upon them, speaking profoundly where the relationship is shallow, they will grow suspicious and turn your words into slander.

      "translated_text": "This passage speaks of the greatest matters in navigating the world, with admonishing a ruler as foremost. If the sovereign has long distrusted you yet you abruptly press loyal counsel upon them, not only will they refuse to heed it, but you may bring about your own execution. Who but the great sage Confucius, profoundly versed in worldly affairs and wise in preserving himself, could grasp this? Even Yan Hui had not yet attained such understanding. This is the foremost concern in human affairs, hence it is addressed first.\n\n“Moreover, in ancient times, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan—both had cultivated their virtue, humbling themselves to soothe the people and opposing their superiors. (Guan Longfeng and Bigan established their reputations through loyalty, yet were ultimately killed. As ministers, they bent their bodies to comfort the ruler’s people. *Yufu* means to bow and console the people, displaying a demeanor of compassion. When the ruler failed to cherish the people, the ministers instead took it upon themselves to do so, seeking renown by contradicting the sovereign’s will. This provoked their wrath and brought about their deaths—was this not a path to death through the pursuit of fame?) Thus, their rulers used their cultivation to cast them out. They were seekers of fame. (These two sought fame through self-cultivation, opposing their rulers, so their rulers used their very cultivation to harm them—this was the fault of their pursuit of fame.)\n\nIn former times, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xu’ao, and Yu attacked Youhu. Their states were left desolate, their rulers turned into vengeful ghosts, and their own bodies suffered execution. Their campaigns did not cease, their pursuit of substance knew no end. (These two sages believed themselves to be acting with benevolence, eliminating tyranny and saving the people. Their quest for the substance of benevolence was unending, hence their ceaseless warfare. This, too, was the pursuit of fame, only multiplying the slaughter.) They were all seekers of fame and substance. (They sought the reputation of benevolence while waging war—achieving fame but losing its substance.) Have you alone not heard of this?\n\nFame and substance are things even sages cannot fully master. How much less can you? (Even the two sages could not fully attain or preserve both fame and substance—how could you?)”\n\nThis is to say that if Yan Hui recklessly acts without cause, seeking the substance of fame, he will surely fail to preserve himself, demonstrating the inevitability of punishment. Moreover, even sages cannot fully master fame and substance—how much less can ordinary people?\n\nThe above passage teaches Yan Hui that he must not go. Below, Confucius further asks about the way to proceed if he must.\n\n“Nevertheless, if you must have a method, tell it to me.” (Confucius said: Though I have explained why you must not go, if the situation compels you, what means will you use? Tell me, and let us see.)\n\nYan Hui replied: “If I maintain integrity while remaining empty, and strive with singleness of purpose, would that suffice?” (Hui said: I have no other method. I would only uphold strict conduct, empty my heart of thoughts of success or failure, and focus my will without regard for gain or loss. Would this suffice?)\n\nConfucius said: “How detestable!”",

Since both he and I share this nature, I say: 'To align with Heaven is to know that both the Son of Heaven and I are children of Heaven. Why should I alone seek that others deem my words good or bad? If I act thus, people will call me a childlike innocent—this is what it means to align with Heaven.'\") (For since our nature is fundamentally the same, the ruler and I are both children of Heaven. I need only speak from my true nature, without concern for whether he deems my words good or bad. If I fully express this sincere and unfeigned heart, he will regard me as a child without guile—what harm could come of this?)\n\n\"Outward yielding means aligning oneself with others. Bowing, kneeling, and curving one’s body are the rites of a minister. If all others observe these rites, how dare I not do the same? To act as others do is to avoid their reproach—this is what it means to align with others.\" (Outward yielding means fully observing the rites of a minister without lapsing in propriety—what fault could there be in this?)\n\n\"To achieve success by emulating the ancients means aligning oneself with antiquity. Though my words may instruct, their substance is reproof, for such words existed in antiquity, not in me. If I act thus, though my words may be direct, they will not be deemed offensive—this is what it means to align with antiquity.\" (To achieve success means to cite established precedents; to emulate the ancients means to measure oneself against them. Thus, though my words may reprove and clarify right and wrong, they are grounded in truth, being the words of the ancients, not my own empty discourse. In this way, though my words may be direct, since they do not originate from me, they will not be taken as an affront.)\n\n\"Would this approach then be acceptable?\" (With these three methods, might success be within reach?)\n\nConfucius said, \"Alas! How could it be? Your methods are too numerous and lack stability.\" (He lamented its impossibility: \"Your principles are too many and lack steadiness.\") (Here, *zhengfa* means \"principles\" or \"standards,\" while *die* means \"stable\" or \"secure.\" To employ these three methods is to rely on too many standards, and thus they remain unsteady.) \"Though you may hold firm, you will still be without fault.\"",

(To say that these three methods, though not blameworthy, are no more than this, and cannot transform the heart of another—why? Because all three proceed from intention, failing to forget the self. And if one has not yet perfected oneself, how can one transform another?)\n\nThis passage speaks of the three methods, which derive from Confucius’ teaching that the noble person has three reverences: to walk with Heaven is to revere Heaven; to walk with others is to revere the great person; to walk with the ancients is to revere the words of the sages. Yet the discussion here is seamless, leaving no trace—these three matters do not reach the boundless transformation of the sage, but remain within the common ways of the world. The meaning lies beyond the words.\n\nYan Hui said, “I have no further progress to make. (My learning has reached this point and no more.) May I ask for your guidance?” (I beg to learn the method by which I may follow your teaching.)\n\nConfucius said, “Fast, and I will tell you.” (You must fast your heart in order to receive my teaching.) “If you act with intention, will it be easy? (If you act with a mind still untransformed, seeking to transform others, how could it be easy?) Those who deem it easy are not in accord with the vast Heaven.”\n\nYan Hui said, “My family is poor, and for months I have drunk no wine and eaten no meat. Might this be considered fasting?” (Here, Yanzi does not yet understand fasting of the heart.)\n\nConfucius said, “This is the fasting of sacrifice, not the fasting of the heart.”\n\nYan Hui said, “May I ask what fasting of the heart is?”\n\nConfucius said, “Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the heart. Do not listen with the heart but listen with qi. Listening ends in resonance. (This means the heart merges with principle.) Qi is that which is empty and awaits things. Only the Dao abides in emptiness. (Emptiness is the essence of the Dao.) Emptiness is the fasting of the heart.” (He teaches Yanzi that the fasting of the heart consists in dwelling in emptiness.)\n\nYanzi’s many methods had not yet departed from intention; all words proceeding from intention fail to forget contrivance. As long as contrivance is not forgotten, the self is not transformed. Thus, he is taught the fasting of the heart, taking emptiness as its ultimate state. In emptiness, self and other are both forgotten, the self is transformed, and things transform of themselves.\n\nYan Hui said, “Before I received this teaching, I indeed took myself to be Yan Hui. (Before instruction, I still clung to the notion of a self.) Now that I have received it, I no longer have a self—may this be called emptiness?” (Upon hearing the teaching of the fasting of the heart, he suddenly forgot himself—can this forgetting of self be called emptiness? Yan Hui’s sudden awakening upon a single word was thus.)\n\nThe Master said, “It is complete! (The principle of the fasting of the heart is fully realized here.) I will now tell you: (You are now ready to receive teaching.) If you can enter and wander within the world’s snares (the snares being the fences of the worldly net) without being moved by reputation (if you can move through the world, emptying yourself and forgetting all concerns, without using cunning to impress others and seek fame), then speak when there is resonance, and cease when there is none. (Do not cling to a fixed intention, but observe the other’s spirit and qi. If there is resonance, speak; if not, desist—do not force it.) Have no gate, no drastic remedy. (A gate means establishing a fixed doctrine. A drastic remedy is like a medicine that must cure—both are harmful and should not be used.)

      "translated_text": "\"To vanish without a trace is easy; to walk the earth without leaving a mark is difficult. (To escape others and withdraw from the world is still relatively easy when one remains alone; to engage with the world without intent, leaving no trace of form or action, is far harder—just as Laozi said, 'The skilled traveler leaves no tracks.') To be employed by men is easy to feign; to be employed by Heaven is difficult to feign. (When the sage responds to the world, it is as Heaven’s emissary. If one were merely an emissary of men, pretense might suffice. But the sage rides the true heart in governing things—how could pretense ever serve?)\n\nWe have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings. (This is a metaphor for acting with intent versus without. People may succeed in affairs when they act with intent, but to respond to things without intent, moving others as if flying without wings—this is unheard of.) We have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge. (People all know through having knowledge. The sage knows without knowledge, for he forgets form and transcends intellect, responding to things with a heart devoid of intent. This is the difficulty—something unheard of.)\n\nBehold that empty space: in a vacant room, brightness arises. (This is a metaphor for the emptiness of the heart. When a room is empty, even a small opening allows light to enter, and brightness fills the vacant space. Likewise, when the heart is empty, the light of Heaven naturally shines forth.) Auspiciousness comes to rest where it rests. (When one acts with intent, fortune and misfortune follow—so-called good and ill fortune, regret and shame, all arise from action. But if the heart is empty of things, not a single thought arises, and clarity shines of itself. Regret and shame vanish entirely, and only auspiciousness comes to rest. This empty heart is where auspiciousness abides.)\n\nYet if one does not rest here, this is called 'sitting while galloping.' (The human heart is originally empty and bright, but if one does not settle the mind here, private desires arise, and though the body sits still, the heart races elsewhere—this is 'sitting while galloping.') If one loses the pursuit of the ears and eyes, turning inward to unify them, and goes beyond the heart’s knowledge, then spirits and gods will come to dwell—how much more so men! (To lose the pursuit of the ears and eyes means to return to true seeing and hearing, hence 'turning inward to unify.' If this inward unity merges with the heart’s essence, the true light shines forth, and one no longer relies on deluded thoughts or false knowledge. Then, in emptiness and clarity, stillness and illumination, one’s virtue aligns with spirits and gods, and they will come to dwell—how much more will men be moved! This is flying without wings. This is the utmost teaching of return.)\n\nThis is the transformation of the ten thousand things. (To lose the ears and eyes is to forget form; to go beyond the heart’s knowledge is to extinguish intellect. When self and things are both forgotten, and the self forgets while things transform, then the ten thousand things all become the Dao.) It is the pivot of Yu and Shun, the lifelong practice of Fuxi and Jiqu, and how much more so for those of scattered minds! (When self and things are both forgotten and the ten thousand things all transform, this is returning to the origin of the great Dao. Even the divine sage Yu held it as his pivot, and the great sages Fuxi and Jiqu governed the world by it throughout their lives—how much more should ordinary people do so! Yan Hui could apply this in the world—what forced action would there be?)\n\nThis speaks of engaging with the world, first in serving one’s lord. This speaks of the difficulty of assisting a lord. If one does not forget both self and things, govern with an empty heart, and respond only to what cannot be avoided, one will never move the lord or avoid disaster. If one stubbornly clings to one’s own views, holds fast to unyielding intentions, and forces remonstrance, not only will it fail to benefit the lord, but it will bring about the calamity of death. This was the error that led to the deaths of Longfeng and Bigan.\n\nBelow, the difficulty of missions is discussed. When Viscount Zigao of She (Zigao was the courtesy name of Liang, a grandee of Chu) was about to be sent on a mission to Qi, he asked Confucius: 'The king’s charge to me is most weighty (implying matters of war and conflict). The way Qi treats envoys is outwardly respectful but inwardly slow to act (though Qi’s lord appears reverent toward envoys, his heart is negligent and cannot address urgent matters). Even a common man cannot be lightly moved—how much less a feudal lord! (The affairs of Chu are urgent, yet if Qi is slow, one dare not press them. Even a common man cannot be lightly moved—how much less a feudal lord!) I am deeply fearful of this. (Fearing that I will fail in the state’s affairs and incur punishment, I am greatly afraid.)\n\nYou once told me: 'In all matters, great or small, few succeed without joyful accord. (I recall your teaching that in all affairs, whether great or small, success requires joyful accord. If Qi is not joyful, the matter will be difficult to accomplish—this is why I fear.) If the matter does not succeed, there will surely be human-caused calamity. (If the matter fails, will the lord not punish me? There will surely be human-caused calamity.) If it succeeds, there will surely be calamity from the imbalance of yin and yang. (If Qi is slow, one must labor in many ways, seeking success through compromise—then the strain of anxiety will bring illness, a calamity of yin and yang.) Only one with virtue can succeed or fail without calamity. (One with virtue refers to a sage of complete virtue. Only the sage, who responds to the world with an empty heart and does not treat things as affairs, can succeed or fail without calamity.')\n\nMy food is coarse and not refined (not indulging in rich flavors), and my kitchen has no one seeking coolness. (My food is simple and plain, with little cooking, so those tending the stove do not seek coolness to escape the heat.)\"",

For a minister, if he concerns himself only with his own reputation and success, he will inevitably seek achievement and completion, his mind entangled with endless calculations, his spirit worn by anxiety and overthinking. Yet all ministers in the world face the difficulty of such missions, utterly unaware of how to conduct themselves, and thus cannot escape calamity. Therefore, the Master teaches the way to conduct oneself: there is a fixed mandate and a fixed principle; if one accepts and follows them with equanimity, one will naturally avoid calamity. But if one clings to the certainty of success, one cannot escape it.\n\nConfucius said: \"There are two great precepts in the world (great precepts refer to the world’s great principles and laws, the unalterable commands of ruler and parent): the first is mandate, the second is duty. A child’s love for a parent is mandate—it cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is nowhere he may go that is not his lord’s (Zhuangzi criticizes benevolence and duty, yet when it comes to a minister’s service to his lord, he takes duty as primary, even deeming death in loyalty unworthy. Here, he says that in a minister’s service to his lord, there is nowhere he may go that is not his lord’s—this is the height of loyalty. How could Laozi have transcended worldly concerns?). There is no escape from them in heaven and earth. These are called the great precepts (the commands of ruler and parent cannot be escaped—these are the world’s great, unchanging principles and laws).\n\nThus, one who serves a parent does not choose a place to find peace—this is the height of filial piety (a child serving a parent has nowhere to go that is not the parent’s command; thus he does not dare choose a place to find peace—this is the height of filial piety). One who serves a lord does not choose the matter to find peace—this is the height of loyalty (one who serves a lord obeys commands without hesitation, never allowing difficulty or ease to divide his heart—this is the height of loyalty. Thus the ancients felt shame at serving their lords with a divided heart). One who serves his own heart does not allow sorrow or joy to alter what lies before him (filial piety demands exhausting one’s strength; loyalty demands fulfilling one’s mandate. The essence is to devote heart and mandate fully, never allowing difficulty or ease to sway one’s resolve. This is the greatest service to the heart—never allowing sorrow or joy to enter it). Knowing that something is beyond one’s control yet accepting it as mandate—this is the height of virtue (a minister’s duty is to know that a matter may be beyond remedy yet never allow a divided heart to regard it. One must accept it as mandate. Accepting mandate means forgetting difficulty and ease—this is the height of virtue).\n\nAs a minister or child, one is bound by what one cannot avoid. One acts according to the true nature of the matter, forgetting oneself (a minister or child is bound by unavoidable duties; one must fulfill one’s mandate, forgetting oneself in the task). How could one have leisure to delight in life and fear death (a minister or child fulfills their mandate—how dare they consider life and death in their choices)? You may proceed thus (teaching Lord She, one should act in this way—it is sufficient).\"\n\nThroughout the *Zhuangzi*, loyalty and filial piety are deemed mere reputation, harmful to natural integrity and unworthy of esteem. Yet in the \"Human World\" chapter alone, he exhausts their true essence, not a word of which can be altered. Who would say he was ignorant of worldly affairs, giving free rein to his own will? And in invoking Confucius’ words, did he ever disrespect the sage? For in learning, there is a distinction between the inner and outer ways.",

      "translated_text": "\"In the outer way, one must esteem unboundedness as lofty, yet it is essential to return to the great Dao. As for the inner way, in matters of ruler-minister and father-child relationships, not a single concession can be made—this is because the great norms and great laws of the world must not be violated. This is what is meant by the Dao of the worldly and the transcendent, which encompasses all without exception and exhausts all principles. How could one view them with a single perspective?\n\n'Let me reiterate what I have heard (having broadly spoken of the righteousness of ruler-minister and father-child relationships, I shall now further discuss the principles of diplomatic missions): In dealings with neighboring states, one must align with trustworthiness (靡 means compliance; 信 means verification. In interactions with neighboring states, verification is indispensable, leaving no room for mere rhetoric). In dealings with distant states, one must be faithful in speech (when engaging with distant states, one must employ faithful rhetoric to harmonize the joy of both nations). Words must be conveyed through messengers (meaning words must be transmitted orally by envoys). Conveying words that bring double joy or double anger is the most difficult task under heaven (the stakes of such words determine safety or peril, and fortune or misfortune follows). When both parties are pleased, there will be an excess of flattery; when both are angered, there will be an excess of slander (the flaw lies in excess). All excess is delusion (excessive praise or slander arises from overreliance on cunning, thus losing its original truth—hence, it is delusion). Delusion cannot be trusted (since the words lack sincerity, the listener remains unmoved and disbelieving). If not trusted, the messenger incurs misfortune (once disbelief arises, the fault lies with the messenger, who will suffer the consequences). Thus, the standard teaching says: \"Transmit the constant sentiments, do not transmit excess words (constant sentiments are truthful and unadulterated). Then one may nearly preserve wholeness.\"'\n\nThis passage speaks of the difficulty of diplomatic missions, where the interests of both parties rest upon the envoy’s shoulders. If words exceed reality, they breed doubt and disbelief in the listener, becoming the root of disaster, and the messenger will inevitably bear the calamity. Thus, truthfulness and absence of delusion are prized, for they may nearly ensure preservation.\n\nThe following text elaborates: though one may provisionally preserve the matter at hand, in the end, great harm will surely follow. Words are not easily spoken—one must be cautious from the very beginning.\n\n'Moreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin with harmony but often end in conflict; when taken to extremes, they resort to excessive cunning (this speaks of the principle of caution at the outset and the end). Consider those who initially engage in playful contests of skill and strength: at first, both parties are in good spirits, but as the contest intensifies, a desire to prevail arises, and each employs their own cunning. Once cunning emerges, injury is inevitable; once injury occurs, the matter becomes earnest and irresolvable, culminating in anger. Here, *yang* signifies joy, and *yin* signifies anger.'\"",

      "translated_text": "\"Those who drink wine with propriety begin in order but often end in chaos; when taken to extremes, they indulge in excessive merriment. All affairs are likewise (consider those who drink wine: at first, host and guest observe proper decorum, but as the wine flows and joy intensifies, chaos inevitably follows. Not only in contests of skill or drinking, but in all matters), beginning in good faith but commonly concluding in deceit (good faith means accepting without discerning right or wrong. Deceit refers to treachery. For instance, in human relationships, one may at first share mutual sincerity and trust without doubt; over time, however, deceitful intentions arise).\n\nWhat begins simply will surely become vast by its end (not only in human relationships, but in all undertakings: one must begin with simplicity and frugality, yet by their conclusion, they inevitably grow vast, becoming uncontrollable. Such is the nature of circumstances). Words are like wind and waves; actions determine gain or loss (no affair can be assured from beginning to end, but words and actions are especially perilous. Words, like wind and waves, give rise to right and wrong; actions spring from reality itself. When actions are complete, reality is lost. Thus it is said: words and actions are the pivot of the noble person, the arbiter of honor and disgrace. What must be guarded, then, could it be taken lightly?).\n\nWind and waves are easily stirred; gain and loss easily endangered (wind and waves may capsize one, while gain and loss may bring ruin and disgrace. Knowing this, one knows what must be guarded). Thus, anger arises from no other source than cunning words and biased speech (all human anger is provoked by cunning words and biased speech). When a beast dies, it does not choose its cries; its breath comes forth in a sudden fury, and from this, malicious intent arises (茀 means sudden; 历 refers to ghostly affliction. When cunning words and biased speech provoke anger, the person’s qi erupts uncontrollably, lashing out without regard, like a dying beast that does not choose its cries. The listener, taking it as truth, will likewise develop an untreatable malice).\n\nWhen scrutiny becomes excessive, it will surely evoke an unworthy response, though one may not realize it (when a person, provoked by words, acts in anger, they will unjustly condemn the object of their wrath, scrutinizing even the slightest detail without leniency. If such scrutiny becomes extreme, the targeted person will inevitably respond with unworthy intentions. Thus, the calamity between the two is sealed, yet neither understands why. The cause lies in cunning words and biased speech). If one remains unaware of the cause, who can foresee the outcome? (If one recognizes the fault in cunning words, there may still be resolution. But if one does not understand their origin, the calamity between the two will have no end).\n\nThus, the maxim states: ‘Do not alter commands; do not urge completion’ (since cunning words and biased speech are the root of calamity and the ruin of affairs, envoys must not exceed their words—do not alter their orders, do not urge completion, to avoid future disaster). Excess transgresses the proper measure (all additions exceed the proper limit. Altering orders or urging completion will inevitably spoil matters; it must not be done).\n\nTrue excellence requires time; evil, once formed, cannot be undone—can one not be cautious? (All affairs should not be rushed to completion; thus, true excellence takes time. If one forces evil to form, it cannot be corrected. One must be cautious!). Moreover, to ride the world with a wandering mind, entrusting oneself to necessity to nurture the center—this is perfection (this teaches the proper way of fulfilling a mission. Only the perfected person, forgetting self and others, follows the natural course of things, wandering the mind among them. Affairs cannot be forced with intention; one must respond to necessity, nurturing the Way of centrality without losing one’s integrity. Such conduct in the world may be called perfection).\n\nWhat action can be repaid? Nothing surpasses fulfilling one’s mandate—this is the most difficult (this concludes the preceding discussion. What can an envoy do to fulfill their duty? Nothing surpasses fulfilling their mandate. Whether an affair succeeds or fails is determined by fate. Even now, as one serves as an envoy, there is a fixed mandate from one’s lord. Knowing that fate cannot be defied, one must accept it and follow its natural course, neither exceeding one’s words nor seeking success through luck. Knowing that the lord’s mandate cannot be defied, one must not alter orders or urge completion, to avoid future disaster. This is the meaning of fulfilling one’s mandate. Only the perfected person can achieve this; for ordinary people, it is not easy—thus, it is the most difficult).\"\n\nThis passage speaks of the difficulty of navigating the world, with nothing surpassing the challenge of fulfilling a mission. Lord Ye’s concerns were indeed justified. The Master’s words capture the essence of missions, the pivot of fortune and misfortune, and the utmost depth of human nature. The saying that \"a scholar offers his life in the face of danger\" could only come from the Master, a sage deeply versed in worldly affairs.\n\nWhen Yan He was about to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei (Kuaikui), he consulted Qu Boyu (whose given name was Yuan, a worthy man of Wei and a friend of Confucius), saying: \"There is a man here whose virtue is decreed by Heaven (read as *jiang*, meaning lowly, referring to one born of inferior nature).

Love may be profound, yet a single misstep can undo it (though one may love the horse deeply, an ill-timed touch can trigger its rage, snapping the reins and shattering the bridle—what then remains of that love?). Can one not be cautious?\n\n(The analogy of the horse is especially apt. These three parables serve as grave warnings for those who serve violent rulers.) Such is the difficulty of aiding a ruler.\n\nThe three examples above all illustrate the perils of navigating the human world. They teach that those who traverse this realm must empty their hearts, accept fate, adapt to the times, and exercise constant vigilance—neither clinging to \"can\" nor \"cannot\"—only then may they avoid calamity. Those who cannot empty their hearts, who rely on cunning and act recklessly without cause, are like Yan Hui. Those who cannot accept fate, who torment themselves with endless worries, who hesitate when action is required, are like Lord Ye. Neither path aligns with the sage’s way of engaging the world; one must take Confucius’ words as the standard.\n\nIf one must, out of necessity, engage with the world and serve a ruler, one must follow their virtues, correct their vices, and exhaust one’s loyalty. Above all, one must proceed with caution and trepidation, discerning change and seizing the moment—never acting carelessly, never relying on talent to provoke recklessly, lest one court destruction. In this, one should heed the words of Qu Boyu.\n\nThe twists and turns of human affairs are fully expounded here. Only by esteeming Confucius and Boyu can one avoid disaster.\n\nThe above speaks of the burdens of talent. Below, the untalented preserve their lives.\n\nWhen Carpenter Shi traveled to Qi and reached Quyuan, he saw an oak that served as a village shrine. Its girth could shade an ox, its circumference measured a hundred spans when embraced; its height rivaled the mountains, its branches appearing only after seventy feet. A dozen of its side limbs were large enough to make boats. Onlookers thronged like a marketplace (people marveled at its size and beauty, gathering in crowds). Yet the master carpenter paid it no heed and walked on without pause (he ignored the tree and continued without stopping). His disciple, sated with the sight, ran to catch up and asked, “Since I took up the axe to follow you, master, I have never seen timber so magnificent. Why did you refuse to look and walk on without pause?”\n\n“Enough,” he replied. “Say no more!”",

      "translated_text": "The tree is but a worthless timber. If made into a boat, it would sink; if made into a coffin, it would rot swiftly; if made into vessels, they would break quickly; if used for doors and gates, it would ooze sap (its hinges would drip with moisture); if used as pillars, it would be eaten by worms. It is a tree of no use. Precisely because it is good for nothing, it has attained such longevity.”\n\nCarpenter Shi returned home, and the oak of the village shrine appeared to him in a dream, saying, “With what would you compare me? Would you liken me to the fine timber? Those crabapples, pears, oranges, and pomelos—fruit-bearing trees—once their fruits ripen, they are stripped and humiliated. Their great branches are broken, their small branches are torn. This is how their usefulness brings suffering to their lives. Thus, they do not live out their natural span but perish midway, felled by the world’s demands. All things are like this. As for me, I have long sought to be of no use! I nearly died before attaining this (for ordinary people, unaware of my worthlessness, nearly felled me many times. Now, by fortune, I remain whole). This is my great usefulness (to preserve my life by being useless). Had I been of use, could I have grown so large? Moreover, you and I are both things—why then do you judge me so (you and I are but things in this world; why do you, relying on your usefulness, deem me useless)? And you, a man nearly dead yourself, how could you know the worth of a worthless tree?”\n\nCarpenter Shi awoke and recounted his dream to his disciples. One disciple asked, “If it sought to be useless, why then did it become a shrine? What is the reason?” He replied, “Hush! Say no more! It merely lodges there (it is only by chance that the shrine is placed upon this tree, for the tree itself has no desire to be a shrine). It is those who do not understand who revile and slander it (ordinary people, not grasping the meaning of this lodging, take the tree to be truly sacred and thus harm it with such a name). Were it not a shrine, would it not have been felled long ago? Moreover, what it preserves is different from the rest, yet people praise it for its righteousness (the tree preserves its natural lifespan by being useless, thus differing from others. Yet people, not understanding, praise it for its utility in benefiting others, restraining violence, and eliminating wrongdoing)—how far this is from the truth!”\n\nThis speaks of the oak shrine tree, which by being useless preserves its natural years, safeguards its life, and avoids harm—this is the great usefulness of being useless. In contrast, those who rely on talent, act recklessly, seek favor from rulers, and court fame only bring harm upon themselves—how vastly different they are from this tree! This is Zhuangzi’s intent in scorning the world and giving free rein to his will. Below, he expounds on the idea of preserving oneself by being useless, illustrating his own resolve. This is the purpose of his discourse.\n\nNanbo Ziqi wandered in the hills of Shang and saw a great tree unlike any other: it could shelter a thousand chariots, its shade enveloping all who rested beneath its branches. Ziqi said, “What tree is this? It must possess extraordinary timber!” Looking up at its slender branches, he saw they were gnarled and unfit for beams; looking down at its great roots, he saw they were split and unfit for coffins. Tasting its leaves, his mouth blistered and burned; smelling them, he was struck with a madness like drunkenness that lasted three days without end. Ziqi said, “This is truly a useless tree, and yet it has grown so vast! Alas, the spirit-like person—it is through such uselessness that they attain sageliness.”\n\nIn Song, there was a region called Jing where catalpa, cypress, and mulberry thrived. Those trees that could be grasped with one or two hands were felled for monkey perches; those three or four spans around were felled for grand and ornate beams; those seven or eight spans around were felled by wealthy households for coffin planks. Thus, they did not live out their natural years but were cut down midway by axes—this is the calamity of being useful. Therefore, when performing expiatory sacrifices, they used oxen with white foreheads (their color impure), pigs with upturned snouts (their form unsightly), and men with hemorrhoids—none of these could be offered to the river (as human sacrifices to the river, or as shamans; the *Han Shu* records that for the River Earl, they selected beautiful boys and girls and cast them into the river, calling it “offering to the river”). The shamans knew well that these were inauspicious (for even these, with the slightest flaw, were enough to preserve their lives).",

      "translated_text": "Yet how much more so for the spirit-like person who preserves themselves through uselessness! This is precisely what makes the spirit-like person supremely auspicious. Here, the extreme safety of worthlessness is made clear, just as the extreme peril of talent and beauty is evident. Only the spirit-like person understands that talent is a calamity, and so they sever sagacity, cast off cunning, remain dull and muddled, and hold no regard for worldly affairs. This is how their uselessness allows them to preserve their body, nurture life, and live out their natural years. Such a warning to the world runs deep indeed.\n\nTake \"Broken Branches\" (a hypothetical name—\"broken\" meaning to efface one’s form, \"branches\" to obscure one’s intelligence, a metaphor for forgetting form and abandoning knowledge): his jowls sink into his navel, his shoulders rise above his crown, his topknot points to the sky (his back so hunched that his neck cranes upward), his five viscera’s transport points face upward (the back’s acupoints now above), and his thighs press against his ribs (his body so contorted that his legs flank his torso). Mending clothes with needles and washing laundry suffice to feed himself; winnowing grain and sifting chaff (tasks suited to his twisted form) suffice to feed ten men (his crooked frame lends strength to winnowing, earning him enough to sustain ten). When conscription is called, Broken Branches waves his arms among the crowd (his deformity spares him fear of selection); when great labor is demanded, he is excused for chronic illness; when grain is doled out to the sick, he receives three bushels and ten bundles of firewood. If one so broken in form can still nourish his body and live out his years, how much more so one broken in virtue! This speaks of how deformity preserves life and averts harm—how much more so for one who relinquishes knowledge and forsakes form! Here, the meaning of Laozi’s words—\"dwelling where the crowd shuns, thus nearing the Dao\"—is expounded. Earlier, the parable of useful and useless trees was used; now, the analogy of man is even more incisive.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, Jie Yu, the Madman of Chu, wandered past his gate and sang:\n*\"Phoenix!

      "translated_text": "This sets forth the intent of \"Among the World of Men\": initially, it presents Confucius as a sage adept at navigating worldly affairs, thus framing the discourse through his voice. The implication is that even Yan Hui’s benevolence and wisdom are ill-suited for engagement with the world, for they risk the folly of forcing action where none is needed. Next, Lord She—himself a man of the world—proves unable to preserve his integrity, let alone others. Then there is Yan He, a mere recluse who, in his delusion, presumes to meddle in temporal matters, revealing his lack of self-awareness; thus, Boyi is invoked to rebuke him. All these are the faults of relying on talent, and none escape harm. Therefore, the text employs the parable of the useless oak and the mountain trees, and further clarifies with the tale of Master Disjointed. Such is the difficulty of navigating the world—hence, the chapter concludes with the madman of Chu mocking Confucius, suggesting that even a sage, if he fails to know when to stop, invites trouble. Here, the Old Master bares his heart and lays bare his true feelings, revealing the profound challenges of worldly existence. Thus, he transcends the mundane, preserving himself through the Dao, embracing poverty and lowliness, and withdrawing from the world without distress, composing texts to express his aspirations. This is the foundational intent of the discourse, and so it concludes \"Among the World of Men\" with this summation—truly, a self-portrait.\n\n---\n\n\"The Sign of Full Virtue\" establishes its intent thus: one whose virtue is fully realized within must be able to wander beyond the confines of the physical form, rather than remain shackled to the shell of the body. For one recognizes the body as the root of great affliction, and thus refrains from pursuing material desires, allowing the mind to roam with Heaven. Those who encounter such a person naturally find their spirits in accord, forgetting form and relinquishing cunning, unaware of how this comes to pass. Therefore, those who study the Dao must focus solely on cultivating full virtue within, without concern for hollow reputations displayed without. Though they do not seek recognition from the world, the world cannot fail to recognize them. Thus, the text invokes several exemplars to illustrate this, echoing Laozi’s notion of \"dwelling where the multitude shuns, and so drawing near the Dao.\"\n\nIn Lu, there was Wang Tai, a man who had lost his feet (the character *wu* here denotes one who has undergone foot amputation). Those who followed him were as numerous as those who followed Confucius. Chang Ji asked Confucius, \"Wang Tai is a man without feet, yet his followers rival yours in Lu (meaning half the state of Lu followed Wang Tai). He neither instructs when standing nor debates when seated. Yet those who go to him empty return full.\"",

I merely follow behind and have yet to approach him. (This means I simply remain behind him, unable to advance to his level.) I would take him as my teacher—how much more should those inferior to me!

If this is so, he does not know what the ears and eyes should perceive, (Having forgotten the physical form, the six senses are of no use, thus effacing perception and hearing.) and his heart roams in the harmony of virtue.

(This means that the heart he has attained is possessed by everyone—why should it surpass others?)\"\n\nConfucius replied, \"People do not see their reflection in flowing water but in still water. Only stillness can still the stillness of others.

      "translated_text": "This chapter expounds upon the sage’s forgetting of reputation, portraying Confucius as one who pursues empty fame rather than true virtue. Thus, he remains bound by rigid distinctions of right and wrong, good and evil, unaware that the perfected person transcends life and death, viewing worldly renown as mere shackles. For one who cannot forget life and death or unify right and wrong remains entangled in the common sentiments of the world. The sage, however, does not regard such attachments as true attainment.\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, “In Wei there was an ugly man named Ai Taituo. When men dwelled with him, they longed for him and could not bear to leave. When women saw him, they pleaded with their parents, saying, ‘I would rather be this man’s concubine than another’s wife’—and this was not just one or two. He never took the lead in anything, only ever harmonizing with others. He held no position of power to save others from death, nor did he amass wealth to fill their bellies. Moreover, his ugliness startled the world. He only followed, never led, and his wisdom did not extend beyond the ordinary. Yet when people disputed over right and wrong or victory and defeat, they turned to him to settle matters. There must have been something extraordinary about him. I summoned him to observe, and indeed, his ugliness startled the world. Yet after spending less than a month with me, I began to sense something admirable in his character. Before a year had passed, I trusted him completely. When the state had no chief minister, I offered him the governance of the realm. He responded with reluctance, as if unwilling, and when he spoke, it was with indifference, as though declining. I felt ashamed, yet in the end, I entrusted him with the state. Shortly after, he left me and departed. I grieved as though I had lost something, as though there were no one left to share the joy of ruling the land. What manner of man was he?”\n\nConfucius replied, “I once traveled to Chu and saw young [tun] apes feeding beside their dead mother. After a moment, they glanced at her unblinking eyes, then abandoned her and fled. They fled because they no longer saw themselves in her gaze, because she no longer resembled the mother they knew. What they loved in their mother was not her form but that which animated her form. The form is but a temporary vessel; that which animates it is the true master. The love of the [tun] apes for their mother is the love of Heaven’s nature. When she was alive, they fed beside her without ceasing to love her. But when she died, they first approached to feed, then saw her unblinking eyes and realized her spirit had departed. Thus, they abandoned her and fled—life and death are not far apart. They knew what they loved was not the mere body but the true master that animated it. Even the most foolish creatures understand this love of their Heaven-given nature—how much more should humans?\n\nWhen warriors die in battle, their burials are not adorned with *sha* banners (the great flags of generals). Though they once embodied courage, their bodies are lost, and such empty rituals lack substance. Likewise, a man who has lost his feet has no use for shoes, and no one cherishes them. Both examples illustrate the absence of what is truly essential. The attendants chosen for the Son of Heaven are not made to trim their nails or pierce their ears, for one does not mar the wholeness of the body to curry favor. A newlywed bride remains secluded and is not assigned further duties, lest her hands and feet become calloused. If even bodily wholeness is so valued, how much more so the person of complete virtue?”",

      "translated_text": "But if merely preserving bodily wholeness is valued to such an extent, how much more so the person of complete virtue!\n\nThis is why the Lord of Lu loved Dai Ta—he forgot the form and cherished the root from which the form arises. There are things that defy verbal description, so the Master [Confucius] illustrated the lovableness of the root through three analogies.\n\nNow, consider Ai Dai Ta: though he had not spoken a word, he was trusted; though he had done no deeds, he was held dear. When others offered him the state, they feared only that he would not accept. Such trust without a word, such intimacy without merit, such willingness to entrust a kingdom—how could this be without reason? It must be that his talents were whole and his virtue unmanifest.\n\nDuke Ai asked, “What does it mean to have whole talents?”\n\nConfucius replied, “Life and death, existence and annihilation, success and failure, wealth and poverty, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of events and the workings of fate. They alternate day and night before us, yet knowledge cannot trace their beginnings. Thus, they are not enough to disturb harmony, nor can they enter the numinous abode. One who causes harmony and ease to flow freely without losing joy—this is to make day and night seamless, to interact with things as spring does, ever generating vitality in the heart. This is what it means to have whole talents.”\n\n“What does it mean for virtue to remain unmanifest?”\n\nConfucius said, “Stillness is the fullness of water at rest. It can serve as a model, for it preserves its inner state without external agitation. The completion of virtue is the cultivation of harmony. When virtue remains unmanifest, things cannot depart from it.”\n\nAnother day, Duke Ai told Min Zi, “At first, I believed that by facing south as ruler of the world, upholding the people’s order, and grieving over their deaths, I had attained the utmost understanding. Now, having heard the words of a perfected person, I fear I lack true substance, that I have treated my person lightly and lost my state.

      "translated_text": "This chapter depicts the virtue of the sage, which must forget form to preserve nature, unify substance and function, harmonize inner and outer, and attain perfect equality and profound unity—only then is the work complete. Thus, the perfection of talent with unmanifest virtue is the ultimate attainment of the sage. For when talent is whole, inner and outer become one; when virtue remains unmanifest, self and others merge as one. This is the sage’s achievement, the sign of full virtue. Hence, the Lord of Lu, upon hearing this, could forget his rank, be moved and transformed, and befriend the sage.\n\nCrooked and crippled, his body incomplete, and armless, he persuaded Duke Ling of Wei. The duke was pleased with him and, looking upon whole men, saw their necks as slender. A man with a great goiter like a jar persuaded Duke Huan of Qi. The duke was pleased with him and, looking upon whole men, saw their necks as slender. Thus, virtue may excel while form is forgotten. These two men’s ugliness so delighted the two rulers that they came to see whole men as inferior—loving their virtue, they forgot their form.\n\nPeople forget what should be forgotten—nature—and remember what should not be forgotten—form. Now, if one does not forget what should be forgotten and forgets what should not be forgotten, this is called true forgetting. Thus, the sage wanders freely, while knowledge becomes a snare, restraint becomes glue, virtue becomes mere social engagement, and skill becomes commerce. The sage does not scheme—why use knowledge? He does not carve—why use glue? He suffers no loss—why use virtue? He does not trade—why use commerce? These four are artificial and corrupt true purity, so the sage discards them to preserve heavenly virtue.\n\nThese four are the nourishment of Heaven. What Heaven nourishes is Heaven’s sustenance. Having received sustenance from Heaven, why turn to man? One may have the form of a human but lack human emotions. Having the form of a human, one mingles with others; lacking human emotions, right and wrong do not cling to one. How minute and small—this is how one belongs to humanity. How vast and great—alone, one completes one’s Heaven.\n\nEarlier, though one may forget form through knowledge, knowledge still remains, and the subtlety of the Dao is not yet exhausted. Thus, this chapter speaks of forgetting even forgetting and knowledge. When knowledge is forgotten, virtue transforms naturally, aligning with spontaneity to fulfill heavenly virtue, and one’s virtue becomes full. Hence, the two rulers, seeing the two men, could overlook their form—this is the sign of virtue. The sage’s ultimate attainment of the Dao reaches its consummation here. Thus, this concludes the meaning of the entire chapter.\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi, “Do humans inherently lack emotions?”\nZhuangzi said, “Yes.”\nHuizi said, “If a human lacks emotions, how can one be called human?”\nZhuangzi said, “The Dao gives one appearance, Heaven gives one form—how can one not be called human?”\nHuizi said, “If one is called human, how can one lack emotions?”\nZhuangzi said, “This is not what I mean by emotions.”",

      "translated_text": "Zhuangzi’s writings declare themselves to have a guiding principle in speech and a sovereign in affairs—meaning that his words have a master and are not idle discourse. The division of his work into Inner and Outer Chapters reflects his teaching of the Dao of \"inner sageliness and outer kingliness.\" To grasp this great Dao in the heart is to become a sage within; when compelled by circumstance to engage with the world, one becomes an emperor or king without. This is a teaching of both essence and function, not empty words.\n\nMoreover, the seven Inner Chapters follow a sequential progression. *Free and Easy Wandering* elucidates the sage of complete embodiment—one who is \"great and transformed,\" serving as the foundational principle and central intent of the entire work. Next, *The Equality of Things* observes that throughout the ages, people fail to comprehend the origin of the great Dao and each clings to their own views as correct, thus engaging in mutual disputation. Beginning with the conflicts between Confucians and Mohists—both of whom, though unaware of the great Dao, insist on the absolute truth of their partial and biased teachings—all remain obstinate and unyielding, deluded about their true master and falsely asserting their own perspectives as right. Thus, from ancient times to the present, no one of great awakening has arisen to correct this, a lamentable confusion of the world born of clinging to self-opinion.\n\n*The Secret of Caring for Life* then explains that people, deluded about their true master, mistakenly take their flesh-and-blood bodies as themselves. Everyone seeks only their own advantage, pursuing fame, rank, and profit to nourish their form, unaware that they are harming their true master. This is the universal delusion of all ages—none know what truly sustains them. If one can nurture the master of life, one transcends the harms of material desire and does not live in vain. Truly knowing the life that sustains life, one may recover celestial authenticity and preserve the integrity of the Dao-body—this is attaining the essence of the sage.\n\n*Human World* addresses the learning of worldly engagement. It teaches that worldly affairs cannot be approached with preconceived intentions or reckless involvement. Those who seek reputation or rely on talent to act presumptuously invariably harm their lives and injure their natures. Even figures like Yanzi and Duke She, who acted without accepting fate or self-knowledge, exemplify this. Only the sage, forgetting the self and emptying the mind to wander through the world, responds only when unavoidable—thus avoiding calamity. The difficulties of worldly engagement are fully revealed here. To navigate the world without harm is the great function of the sage.\n\n*Signs of Full Virtue* clarifies that the sage, forgetting form and releasing wisdom, embodies both essence and function, moving with the Dao without intent toward the world—this is the sign of full virtue. *The Great and Venerable Teacher* synthesizes the six preceding themes: the Dao is complete, virtue is perfected, and all is harmoniously transformed. Self, merit, and fame are forgotten. Those called \"perfected persons,\" \"spiritual persons,\" or \"sages\" must be thus—only then can they be revered as teachers for all ages, hence the title *The Great and Venerable Teacher*. This is the great sage of complete embodiment, signifying that the learning of inner sageliness reaches its ultimate here—this is attaining its essence. When compelled by circumstance to engage with the world, one may become a sagely emperor or enlightened king. Thus, *Responding to Emperors and Kings* concludes the Inner Chapters.\n\nThe Outer Chapters expand upon and elaborate the ideas of the Inner Chapters. \"To know the workings of Heaven and the workings of humanity is perfection\" (here, \"know\" refers to true knowledge, meaning profound awakening. \"Heaven\" denotes the natural great Dao, the guiding principle of all things. \"Workings\" refers to the transformations of Heaven and Earth and the myriad things, which are the manifestations of the great Dao’s complete body—thus \"the workings of Heaven.\" For Heaven acts without intention, yet subtly completes the myriad things. \"The workings of humanity\" refers to humans, who receive the great Dao as one of the myriad things, yet are the most spiritually endowed. Endowed with the great Dao’s complete body as their nature, they govern their forms—this is the so-called true master. Thus, human perception, cognition, and daily activities are all governed by the true master; every moment is the wondrous function of the great Dao. To know humanity is to know Heaven. If one knows the unity of Heaven and humanity, this is the perfection of knowledge).\n\n\"To know the workings of Heaven is to be born of Heaven\" (to know the great Dao within humans, received at birth). \"To know the workings of humanity is to use what knowledge knows to nurture what knowledge does not know, thus fulfilling one’s Heaven-appointed years without premature death—this is the flourishing of knowledge\" (\"What knowledge knows\" refers to the knowledge of daily perception and cognition. \"What knowledge does not know\" refers to the originally inherent wondrous nature, which people, deluded, fail to awaken to, thus remaining unaware in daily life. Due to this unawareness, though it exists, they only know how to indulge desires to nourish the form, unaware of releasing wisdom and forgetting form to nurture their nature. Thus, the world is universally deluded by material desires, harming life and injuring nature, unable to fully realize their nature and complete their lives to fulfill their Heaven-appointed years. If one can, in daily life, abandon greed and detach from desires, illuminate the mind in every circumstance, turn the light inward to reflect, and recover one’s nature—this is using what knowledge knows to nurture what knowledge does not know. Such profound awakening is the flourishing of knowledge).\n\nYet there is a danger: for knowledge to be appropriate, it must depend on something, but what it depends on is not yet certain. (The phrase \"yet there is a danger\" means that while I speak of using what is known to nurture what is unknown, there remains a flaw. Why? Because people have long been deluded by false knowledge, relying on it to feign understanding where there is none, mistaking ignorance for awakening, and acting recklessly—thus harming their nature. Only when true awakening and true knowledge are attained can it be truly appropriate. Yet what one depends on to awaken may not be genuine awakening; if one clings to it as already awakened, it cannot be considered certain.)",

      "translated_text": "If one truly awakens to the core, where Heaven and humanity merge in virtue and the original state is undivided, only then can it be called true knowledge.\n\nYet how can we be sure that what I call \"Heaven\" is not actually humanity? Or that what I call \"humanity\" is not actually Heaven? Only when there is a true person does true knowledge arise. (This means that when I speak of nurturing Heaven through humanity, I do not imply that there is some wondrous Dao beyond the daily activities of human life. For Heaven is humanity, and humanity is the Great. It is a matter of awakening to the original undivided state, where nothing is lacking. Only when one truly knows that Heaven and humanity are one can one be called a true person.)\n\nThis passage is the central thesis of the entire text, with the character \"knowledge\" (*zhi*) as its focal point. As the ancients said: \"The character *zhi* (knowledge) is the gateway to all wonders; the character *zhi* is also the gateway to all calamities.\" For only after profound awakening does true knowledge arise; one who possesses true knowledge is called a true person and may be revered as a teacher. Yet knowing Heaven and knowing humanity is the gateway to all wonders. Nevertheless, there is a danger: the very character *zhi* (knowledge) is also the gateway to all calamities. This refers to those who feign knowledge where there is none, relying on false understanding to act recklessly—thus turning knowledge into harm. This is the common affliction of the world’s clever.\n\nWhat, then, is a true person? (Here, the text invokes the true person to show that what they nurture is profound and far removed from the ordinary.) The true persons of old did not reject the few (the few refers to those of meager virtue and little wisdom; \"not reject\" means they did not spurn them), did not assert their own achievements (asserting oneself means relying on one’s own virtue; \"achievements\" refers to considering oneself complete in virtue; they did not use their own virtue to provoke the world), and did not scheme (scheming refers to plotting; this means they were without intention in matters, moving through the world with an empty mind, never allowing affairs to trouble their hearts). Such a one (a true person living thus in the world) does not regret mistakes nor take pride in correctness. Such a one ascends heights without fear, enters water without getting wet, and walks through fire without feeling heat—this is knowledge that can ascend to the Dao. (This means the true person moves through the world without intention, free from concerns of gain or loss, advantage or harm. Unattached to things in mind, water and fire cannot harm them. This is to abandon things and preserve one’s nature, where knowledge can ascend to the distant Dao.)\n\nIn this way (the true person, forgetting the world while in it), the true persons of old slept without dreaming (dreams arise from deluded thoughts; since the true person’s mind is unattached to things, deluded thoughts do not arise, and thus they sleep without dreams), awoke without worry (the true person moves through the world with an empty mind, free from concerns of gain or loss, and thus awakes without worry), ate without savoring taste (finding joy in the Dao, they do not delight in flavors), and breathed deeply (deep means continuous and unbroken. Coarse and shallow breathing indicates a restless mind; the true person’s mind is tranquil and unmoved by things, and thus their breath is deep). The true person’s breath reaches their heels (this explains the meaning of \"deep.\" The heel is the base of the foot, symbolizing the profound and unfathomable origin of the breath, where the mind is settled and undisturbed), while the breath of ordinary people reaches only their throat (the breath of ordinary people is at the throat, extremely coarse and shallow, and thus restless and deluded, their minds constantly chasing after things and unaware of the Dao).\n\nThose who are submissive and servile speak as if vomiting from their throats (a restless mind leads to hasty speech; words not arising from the center are easily bent to submission. The throat is the passage for speech; \"vomiting\" means shallow, coarse words are spat out without root). The deeper one’s cravings, the shallower one’s heavenly mechanism (this means that those who are so coarse and shallow are deeply mired in desires, which cloud their true nature and leave them entirely ignorant of their innate wondrous nature. They are trapped in false knowledge and lack true knowledge).\n\nThis passage describes how the true person’s profound awakening to their original nature constitutes true knowledge, and thus what they nurture is far removed from the ordinary. From the perspective of the common person, they appear entirely distinct. The earlier warning of danger refers precisely to the harm caused by those who have not awakened but cling to false knowledge as if it were true. Thus, the text clarifies both sides.\n\nThe true persons of old did not delight in life nor detest death (earlier, the text briefly described how the true person lives in the world, forgetting advantage and harm; here, it explains that the true person not only forgets advantage and harm but also transcends life and death. United with the great Dao, they awaken to the truth that life is fundamentally non-life, and thus do not delight in it; they awaken to the truth that death is fundamentally non-death, and thus do not detest it). Their departure brings no joy, their return no resistance (departure and return refer to life and death, as Laozi said: \"Birth is departure, death is return.\" Since they do not delight in life, they do not cling to it. \"Joy\" here means clinging. Since they do not detest death, they do not resist it. \"Resistance\" means clawing and refusing to enter). They come and go with effortless ease (effortless ease is like the sound of a crane taking flight, its wings brushing the air. This means the true person moves through the world without intention, coming and going through life and death as if wandering the vast emptiness, utterly free and unobstructed. Thus, it is said: \"merely thus\").\n\nThey do not forget their beginning nor seek their end (awakening to the truth that life is fundamentally non-life, they do not forget their origin; since life wanders with the Dao and does not see the world as something to depart from, merging the ten thousand things into one, they do not seek an end). They accept and delight in it, forget and return to it (ordinary people see life as a burden and thus suffer and do not delight in it. The true person carries the Dao in life and thus delights in receiving form. Though living in the world, their mind does not stray from the Dao, forgetting the world and returning at every moment). This is called not using the mind to abandon the Dao, not using humanity to assist Heaven—this is the true person. (The mind wanders with the Dao, and thus does not abandon it.)",

These four phrases elucidate the earlier four—punishment, ritual, knowledge, and virtue.\n\nYet people truly mistake this for diligent practice (Laozi says, “Its use is never strained”—strained meaning laborious. The true person wanders through the world without intent, moving yet never toiling).\n\nThis passage depicts the wondrous state of the true person’s empty-hearted wandering in the world: though transcending the world, they never depart from it; though mingling with others, they do not flock with them. This is the essence of true knowledge.\n\nThus, whether they favor it or not, it is one and the same (The *thus* arises from the singularity of their wandering in the world, achieving the union of Heaven and humanity. To favor it is Heaven; not to favor it is humanity. Now both are one—this is called the union of Heaven and humanity).\n\nWhether unified or not, it is one (The *one* refers to the unity of Heaven and humanity. When Heaven and humanity unite and return to the Dao, then the myriad things, though diverse and not one, all merge into the Dao).\n\nThose who are one become companions of Heaven (When humanity unites with Heaven, humanity and Heaven become one, and humanity may thus become Heaven’s companion). Those who are not one become companions of others (Originally, Heaven and humanity were not one. Now, though humanity has united with Heaven, they still wander in the human world, moving with Heaven yet keeping company with others). Heaven and humanity do not overcome one another—this is the true person (If one were to transcend the world entirely, it would be Heaven overcoming humanity; if one were to lose their nature in pursuit of things, it would be humanity overcoming Heaven. But when Heaven and humanity unite in virtue, neither harms the other, and thus neither overcomes. Only thus is one a true person).\n\nThis passage concludes the earlier work of knowing Heaven and knowing humanity, achieving a seamless unity where Heaven and humanity merge. Only then can one follow their natural truth, being in Heaven as Heaven, in humanity as humanity—Heaven and Earth sharing the same root, the myriad things forming one body. Thus Heaven and humanity do not overcome one another. Only through such true knowledge, profound realization, and complete transformation can one be called a true person. How could this be grasped by forced understanding or deluded perception!\n\nThis is the full achievement of the true person’s true learning. Thus, the following chapter begins with “Life and death are fate” and continues through the “Hiding the Boat” chapter, urging people to study the Dao and engage in true practice.\n\nLife and death are fate (Hereafter, one is taught to master the work of life and death. *Fate* refers to what is natural and inescapable); their constancy is like night and day—this is Heaven (Human life and death are like the alternation of night and day, inescapable. Moreover, yin and yang have night and day, yet the great void remains eternally unchanged, without dusk or dawn. This illustrates that though the human form undergoes life and death, the true nature remains constant and unchanging, like the unchanging void—thus it is called Heaven).\n\nWhat humanity cannot intervene in (pronounced *yù*) is the nature of things (The true nature resides in humanity, inherently complete, with not a trace of human effort able to interfere. This is the true essence shared by all, what is called the true master or celestial ruler. This must be cultivated before it can be known).\n\nThey take Heaven as their father (All people receive their true nature and take form, naturally complete—thus they take Heaven as their father). Yet they still cherish their bodies—how much more should they cherish that which is transcendent! (This transient body of blood and flesh owes its existence to one’s worldly father, and one nurtures it with filial devotion to honor their father. How much more should one honor and cultivate the celestial ruler that bears one’s form, transcendent and not bound to the body!)\n\nPeople take having a lord as superior to themselves and are even willing to die for him—how much more should they do so for the true! (Moreover, people know they have a lord and wish to serve him with utmost loyalty, even to the point of death. How much more should they serve the true lord that governs their form, forgetting the body to attend to it with devotion! To fail to do so is the height of folly. These words are deeply stirring—who could read them and not awaken?)\n\nThis speaks of the true nature within us, which does not belong to life and death, being the everlasting nature. Yet people are deluded and do not awaken, their desires harming it while they remain unaware of its cultivation—is this not the utmost foolishness?\n\nWhen springs dry up, fish find themselves together on dry land, warming one another with moisture, moistening one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes (Laozi says: “Lose the Dao, then virtue; lose virtue, then benevolence; lose benevolence, then righteousness.” This takes fish out of water as losing the Dao and virtue, then benevolence and righteousness. Moreover, to uphold benevolence and righteousness is like moistening one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. This illustrates that one must forget benevolence and righteousness to wander in the realm of the great Dao).\n\nRather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, it is better to forget both and embody the Dao (Without praise or blame, good and evil are both forgotten, uniting with the Dao—this is the flourishing of true knowledge).\n\nThe great clod (Heaven and Earth) burdens me with form, wearies me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to be good to my life is to be good to my death (Human life in Heaven and Earth, the toil and ease of life and death, are all natural and inescapable—this is fate. This is what is called humanity. If one knows where fate is bound, the Dao is present. Thus, knowing humanity leads to knowing Heaven. If one understands that Heaven and humanity are originally not two, then one merges seamlessly with the Dao, not allowing humanity to harm Heaven).",

      "translated_text": "Embracing emptiness, one roams the world to fulfill one’s great years, never forgetting the Dao in life. Thus it is said: \"To be good to my life is to be good to my death.\" Here, Heaven and humanity merge in virtue, death and life remain unchanged, and one follows the spontaneity of creation—this is the perfection of knowledge.\n\nThis speaks of how worldly people, ignorant of the great Dao, regard benevolence and righteousness as supreme. Thus they love their kin with benevolence and serve their lords unto death. Though this may seem good, it is not truly so—like fish in a dried-up spring, gasping and moistening one another with foam. If one could awaken to the great Dao in its wholeness, then the myriad things would form a single body, and good and evil would both be forgotten—like fish forgetting one another in the rivers and lakes. Only then can one be said to know Heaven and know humanity, merging Heaven and humanity in virtue, and transcending beyond life and death. In ancient times, whether in life or in death, there was nothing that was not good.\n\nHiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh may seem secure, yet in the dead of night, a strong man may carry them away, and the unwitting will not perceive it. (Hiding one’s celestial truth within form is like hiding a boat in a ravine; hiding form within Heaven and Earth is like hiding a mountain in a marsh. This may seem secure—such is the fixed view of ordinary people. Yet the subtle shifts of creation, though even Heaven and Earth are transformed by them, go unnoticed by the common folk, just as the unwitting do not perceive when a strong man carries things away.)\n\nEven when concealing the small within the great as is fitting, there is still escape. But if one hides the world within the world, there is no escape—this is the great truth of all things. (If one knows that this body, together with Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, is originally one with the Dao, merging seamlessly with the great transformation without distinction, then one hides the formless within the formless. In this way, there is no escape—like hiding the world within the world, where no escape is possible. This is the true reality of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, hence the great truth of all things.)\n\nYet people delight in possessing human form. If human form is but one of the myriad transformations, never reaching an end, how can its joy be measured? (Creation’s transformations are boundless, and humanity is but one among the myriad things. Yet people, unaware of this, take delight in having obtained a human body. If this is so, then all things possess their own joy—how can its measure be calculated?)\n\nThus the sage roams where things cannot escape, and all are preserved. Whether in premature death or long life, in beginning or end, all is good, and people emulate this. How much more so for that on which the myriad things depend and by which the one transformation is sustained? (The origin of the great Dao is the root and source of the myriad things, hence it is called \"that on which they depend.\" Without it, the myriad things cannot be harmonized into one, hence it is called \"that by which the one transformation is sustained.\" This is truly the great origin of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things—the very source that the sage venerates and takes as teacher. Can one fail to awaken to this?)\n\nThis elucidates that the great Dao is formless and is the root of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. Each person receives this formless great Dao and is born—this is the true master. If one awakens to this great Dao, then Heaven, Earth, the myriad things, body, mind, and world all dissolve and merge into one. One who thoroughly comprehends this principle is called the Great Ancestral Master—this is what is meant by \"great and transformed, one is called a sage.\" At this stage, there is no self, no merit, no fame; one roams freely above the myriad things, transcending the path of life and death.\n\nYet most people do not grasp the wonder of this great Dao, clinging instead to their petty knowledge and views, asserting their own rightness. Unable to roam freely, they each hold fast to their own opinions, mutually affirming and negating, thus losing the master of their own lives. Seeking fame and profit in the world, their virtue does not match their destiny. This is why the previous five chapters, though expounding these truths, did not fully reveal them. Thus, this chapter begins by establishing that knowing Heaven and knowing humanity, possessing true knowledge, one becomes a true person. It proceeds directly to this point, finally pointing to the Great Ancestral Master—precisely the teaching that Laozi and Zhuangzi took as their foundation. Only thus is the matter settled.\n\nThereafter, the text returns to the single word \"Dao\" to elaborate, demonstrating the coherence of its argument from beginning to end. Though the words may seem expansive, their meaning has a single source—this is evident here.\n\nThe Dao (the above describes the appearance of the Great Ancestral Master, concluding the previous meaning. The Great Ancestral Master is that which is revered. The great Dao, as mentioned earlier, is that which the myriad things preserve and by which the one transformation is sustained—what is this? It is the great Dao. Thus, what follows elaborates on the wonder of the great Dao, clarifying the meaning of \"that which the myriad things preserve\" and \"that by which the one transformation is sustained.\" The intent is drawn from Laozi’s \"Heaven obtains the One and becomes clear,\" etc.) has essence and trustworthiness (this speaks of the substance and function of the great Dao. The *Qi Wu* chapter says, \"It can be formed and is trustworthy\"—having essence without form refers precisely to this. This is drawn from Laozi’s \"Dark and obscure, within it there is essence; its essence is most true, within it there is trustworthiness.\" Here, \"having essence\" means that though empty, it has a real substance and does not lose its function—this is called \"trustworthiness\"), is non-active and formless (abiding in stillness, hence non-active; transcending names and appearances, hence formless). It can be transmitted but not received, can be attained but not seen (transmitted mind-to-mind, hence it can be transmitted and received; wondrously aligned beyond words, hence there is no receiving or attaining). It is self-originating and self-rooted (naturally so, not borrowed from elsewhere). Before Heaven and Earth existed, it was already eternally present (Heaven and Earth are established by it, hence it existed prior to them). It spiritually animates ghosts and gods, gives birth to Heaven and Earth (its transformations are unfathomable, making it the master of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things).",

      "translated_text": "Ere the Great Ultimate it dwells yet is not exalted (Fu Xi drew the trigrams beginning with the Great Ultimate; yet when traced further upward, there is still something beyond—thus it is not deemed exalted). Beneath the Six Poles it abides yet is not profound (encompassing Heaven and Earth, containing the Six Directions, thus it is not deemed profound). Before Heaven and Earth were born it existed yet is not ancient (by its eternal presence, it is not deemed ancient). Older than high antiquity it endures yet is not aged (the myriad transformations shift imperceptibly, yet this Dao remains serene—thus it does not age).\n\nWhen Fu Wei (an ancient sovereign) attained it, he used it to lift Heaven and Earth (assisting in transformation and ordering the world). When Fu Xi (of the Three August Ones) attained it, he drew upon the Mother of Qi (to *draw upon* is to take; the Mother of Qi is the root of all life—*drawing upon the Mother of Qi* is as Laozi sought sustenance from the Mother). When the Northern Dipper (the pivot of Heaven) attained it, it never erred through all antiquity (erring means deviation; the Northern Dipper, Heaven’s axis, remains unmoving—thus it does not deviate). When the sun and moon attained it, they never ceased through all antiquity (moving without end, functioning without exhaustion). When Kan Huai (a divine being of Kunlun, shaped like a beast) attained it, he inherited Kunlun (here *inherited* means to uphold, signifying his stewardship of Kunlun). When Feng Yi (the River Earl) attained it, he roamed the great rivers. When Jian Wu (a mountain spirit) attained it, he dwelled on Mount Tai. When the Yellow Emperor (Xuanyuan) attained it, he soared through the cloudy heavens (riding a dragon to ascend as an immortal). When Zhuan Xu (one of the Five Emperors) attained it, he resided in the Dark Palace. When Yu Qiang (the god of the Northern Sea, described in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* as \"a spirit on the Dark Isle, with a human face and bird’s body, wearing two blue serpents as earrings and treading two serpents,\" named Yu Qiang) attained it, he stood at the Northern Pole (the extremity of the Northern Sea). When the Queen Mother of the West (the immortal sovereign of the Jasper Pool) attained it, she sat in the Lesser Expanse (the palace where the Queen Mother dwells).\n\nNone know its beginning, none know its end (these two lines summarize the foregoing: the sages and divine beings who govern Heaven, Earth, sun, moon, and stars all rely on the Great Dao—thus none know its beginning or end. This directly transforms the passage in Laozi where \"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear\").\n\nWhen Peng Zu (surnamed Qian, an ancient paragon of longevity) attained it, his years spanned from the age of Yu to the Five Hegemons (legend holds Peng Zu lived eight hundred years, thus ranging from the time of Yu to the Five Hegemons). When Fu Yue (the worthy minister of Wu Ding) attained it, he assisted Wu Ding, riding the Eastern Ridge and straddling the Tail of the Milky Way to join the ranks of the stars (the star Fu Yue lies above the Tail; this describes his position between the Eastern Ridge and the Tail of the Milky Way).\n\nThis clarifies that the Great Ancestral Master is what is revered—the Great Dao. For the Great Dao is the master of Heaven and Earth, the myriad things, and divine beings. Now, every person is endowed with this Great Dao at birth, dwelling within this bodily form as the master of life—what is called the innate nature. Since the form is borrowed while the nature is true, it is termed the True Sovereign. When one awakens to this Great Dao and thoroughly perceives the truth of nature, one can transcend the bodily form, directly merging with the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth, blending into oneness. Thus, one becomes the common ancestor of all beings in the world—hence the term *Great Ancestral Master*. This Great Ancestral Master is the divine being, sage, and perfected one spoken of in \"Free and Easy Wandering.\" The *having sentiment* and *trustworthiness* mentioned earlier are the True Sovereign of \"Equalizing Things\" and the Master of Life in the \"Nourishing Life\" chapter. If one does not awaken to this but engages with the world, one is inevitably beset by the great peril of the bodily form. Yanzi’s *fasting of the mind* teaches the method of awakening to it. Once the truth of nature is awakened, the bodily form can be transcended. Thus, in the preceding \"Signs of Full Virtue,\" all passages elaborate the states of delusion and awakening through the ages—only here is it clearly revealed. The entire discourse has now been laid bare. Thus it is said, \"Words have their source, affairs have their lord\"—this is precisely the meaning.\n\nThe foregoing has expounded the Great Dao, making it perfectly clear, but the work of entering the Dao has not yet been discussed. Thus, what follows describes the true practice of entering the Dao.\n\nNanbo Zikui asked Nü Gua (these are both double names; the author introduces these figures to set up a dialogue—there is no need to seek their historicity), \"You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like that of a child—how is this so?\" (He asks how, though aged, his countenance remains like an infant’s, using this to introduce the necessity of cultivation and to initiate the discussion of practice.) Nü Gua replied, \"I have heard the Dao.\" (This is meant to lead the other to study the Dao.)\n\nNanbo Zikui said, \"Can the Dao be learned?\" (Hearing that one has *heard the Dao*, he expresses astonishment, asking if the Dao can indeed be learned.) Nü Gua replied, \"Alas! How could it be so? (Both *alas* are read in the level tone, expressing surprise. The first *alas* laments the difficulty of speaking of the Dao; the second *alas* laments that the Dao is not easily learned—only the right person can do so.) You are not that person. (The Dao is not easily learned, much less by one who is not destined to learn it. How can this be known?)\n\nNow, Bu Liangyi possesses the talent of a sage (talent refers to one’s inborn endowment, akin to what is commonly called *natural disposition*) but lacks the Dao of a sage (he has fine qualities but no aspiration to enter the Dao). I possess the Dao of a sage but lack the talent of a sage (I have the Dao of a sage but lack fine qualities, thus I have endured much hardship). If I were to teach him, perhaps he might truly become a sage. (If I were to teach Bu Liangyi the Great Dao, he could be taught—but he lacks the aspiration.)\"",

If not, then to teach the Dao of the sage to one possessing the talent of a sage would be easy indeed. (Those who study the Dao and unite both talent and virtue in full measure are rare indeed. Yet with such complete endowment, learning comes easily.)\n\nI still persist in teaching him, and after three days he is able to put the world outside himself. (The world is distant and vast, thus three days suffice to set it aside. This describes the first stage of instruction.) Having put the world outside himself, I persist further, and after seven days he is able to put things outside himself. (Things are closer to the self, thus seven days are needed to forget them.) Having put things outside himself, I persist further, and after nine days he is able to put life outside himself. (Life is most intimate to the self, thus nine days of effort are required to set it aside.) Only after putting life outside himself can he attain morning clarity. (Morning is the break of day; clarity is radiant awakening. Having set life aside, he suddenly awakens as if from sleep, thus it is called morning clarity.) With morning clarity, he can then perceive the solitary. (The solitary refers to the awakening of the one true nature, no longer bound to the bodily form, thus it is called perceiving the solitary.) Perceiving the solitary, he can then transcend past and present. (Awakening to the one true nature transcends heaven and earth, thus it is no longer bound to past or present.) Transcending past and present, he can then enter the state of neither death nor life. (Having awakened to the true nature, transcending heaven and earth, and cutting off past and present, he perceives the original state of neither death nor life.)\n\nThat which kills life does not die. (Life is the burden of form. Having awakened to the true nature, the bodily form is set aside, and all worldly burdens dissolve, thus killing life leaves only the one nature, hence it does not die.) That which gives life to life does not live. (When form is transformed and nature is complete, it merges with the Dao in darkness and unity, giving rise to all living things. Yet the one true nature remains serene, thus it is said that which gives life to life does not live.)\n\nAs for this thing—(this refers to the essence of the Dao, which is neither death nor life)—there is nothing it does not carry, (This essence of the Dao undergoes endless transformations, thus there is nothing it does not carry. *Carry* means to bear or sustain.) nothing it does not welcome, (For the person who embodies it, every moment of daily life meets the source at every turn, thus there is nothing it does not welcome.) nothing it does not destroy, (This essence of the Dao refines all transformations, blunting sharpness and resolving entanglements, thus there is nothing it does not destroy.) and nothing it does not complete. (It manifests everywhere without need for contrivance.)\n\nThis is called *yīngníng*. (*Yīng* refers to the heart being disturbed by the dust of labor, chaos, and adversity; *níng* is the state of tranquility and serenity.

      "translated_text": "This passage now points to the method of learning the Dao. It means that although this Dao is inherent in everyone, since there are no born sages, one must cultivate it to achieve completion. For those who seek to learn, they must possess a fully refined root-capacity to be worthy of transmission and reception. The act of transmission and reception must not be careless; it requires the method of direct instruction, face-to-face guidance, and steadfast teaching. Nor can it be rushed; one must enter gradually, step by step. Thus, one awakens bit by bit: after three days, the world is transcended; after seven days, things are transcended; after nine days, life and death are transcended—only then does one perceive the solitary, attain clarity at dawn. Such is the effect of awakening.\n\nHaving awakened to this Dao, in every situation, in daily life at every turn, it manifests spontaneously, unobstructed in all directions. Though amidst the dust and toil of the world, the heart remains profoundly settled and serene, the ruler of the mind at peace, undisturbed and still. When practice reaches this point, it is called *yīngníng*. What is *yīngníng*? It is that which is accomplished only after enduring entanglements—thus it is said to be completed only after *yīng*.\n\nThough this elder’s words may seem diffuse, the work of cultivating the Dao all arises from perseverance amid hardship; it is not achieved lightly. How can those who read his words today regard them merely as literature?\n\nThe preceding discussion concerns the work of entering the Dao, while the following speaks of hearing the Dao—this, too, arises from awakening through words. Thus, it is expressed with reiteration.\n\nNanbo Zikui said, “Where did you alone hear this?” He replied, “I heard it from the son of *fumo* (*fumo* refers to writing—it means it first came from words). The son of *fumo* heard it from the grandson of *luosong* (*luosong* means reciting and studying texts—it implies that through long recitation and study, one naturally attains understanding). The grandson of *luosong* heard it from *zhanming* (*zhanming* means seeing where there is clarity—it refers to awakening through words). *Zhanming* heard it from *nieshu* (*nieshu* means hearing with the ears, where sound enters the heart and the heart assents). *Nieshu* heard it from *xuyi* (*xu* means waiting; *yi* means employing—it means that though the heart has awakened, one must wait to verify it in action, manifesting it clearly in all situations, aligning with the Dao, and only then attaining subtlety). *Xuyi* heard it from *yuu* (*yuu* means immersing and chanting). *Yuu* heard it from *xuanming* (through immersion and chanting, one merges with the profound in the heart—this is the ultimate attainment of the Dao). *Xuanming* heard it from *canliao* (*canliao* refers to the vast, empty, and boundless state—it signifies the true reality of the Dao). *Canliao* heard it from *yishi* (it means entering the beginningless—this is the ultimate return of the completion of learning the Dao).”\n\nThis passage explains that even the sage who attains the Great Dao does not do so without hearing. It arises from enlightenment through words and speech, extending to all actions, chanting, and even the slightest utterances, merging with the profound and obscure, entering the vast and boundless, and reaching the unknowable beginning. Only after such deep realization and verification does it end—this cannot be attained merely through words or hearing. Only then can one be called a great master.\n\nThe foregoing has elucidated the Great Dao as worthy of veneration, and those who awaken to it may be called masters. But has anyone truly attained this? Lest the world dismiss it as empty talk, the following introduces Zisi and others as genuine adepts of the Dao, serving as evidence.\n\nZisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai spoke to one another, saying, “Who can take non-being as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tail? Who knows that life and death, existence and extinction, are one body—with such a one, I would be friends.” The four looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord, and so they became friends.\n\nZiyu fell ill, and Zisi went to visit him. Ziyu said, “How mighty is the Creator, to make me like this—so constrained!” (Here Ziyu laments: the power of creation is great indeed, to shape me thus within the great transformation.) His body was bent and hunchbacked, his back covered in sores. Above were the five orifices (his body bent, so the tubes of the five viscera pointed upward), his chin hidden in his navel (his body curved, so his cheeks were concealed below his navel), his shoulders higher than his head, his topknot pointing to the sky (his chin hidden and neck contracted, so his topknot pointed upward). The qi of yin and yang were in disharmony (disharmony means disorder—though his form was received from the transformation of heaven, the disharmony of yin and yang qi caused his body to become so ruined and unbearable). Yet his heart was at ease, untroubled (though his body was ruined, his heart was free of care—this fully shows his ability to find contentment in the Dao, unburdened by his form).\n\nHobbling and dragging himself, he looked into a well (hobbling means leaning for support—fearing his self-knowledge was unclear, he looked into the well and saw his reflection like a shadow) and sighed, “Alas!”",

In this way, they simply follow wherever creation leads, without any thought of gain or loss. Therefore, life and death bring no change to them, and so they abide in timing, comply with nature, and sorrow and joy cannot enter. This is what is meant by \"suspended release.\" From this perspective, all people are originally and naturally liberated, but they torment themselves with the burden of form and ultimately cannot free themselves. This is not Heaven’s fault, but rather people who bind themselves. Moreover, at the boundary between Heaven and humanity, it has long been the case that humanity cannot overcome Heaven. I have seen through this for a long time. Though I possess this borrowed form, I have its true use—what then should I resent?\n\nThis is why they are called true persons, those worthy of reverence and emulation. Soon after, Zilai fell ill, gasping for breath as death approached. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Li went to see him and said, \"Shoo! Away! Do not be startled by transformation!\" Leaning against the doorframe, he spoke to Zilai: \"How wondrous is creation! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you into a mouse’s liver? Or an insect’s limb?\" Zilai replied, \"For a child, parents may send them east or west, north or south, and the child must obey. The forces of yin and yang are no less than parents to a person. If they bring me near death and I do not listen, then I am defiant—what fault is that of creation? The great earth bears me with form, wearies me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well. If a great smith casts metal, and the metal leaps up saying, ‘I must become Moye!’ the smith would surely deem it an inauspicious metal. Now, having merely chanced upon a human form, one says, ‘Human! Human!’ Creation would surely deem this an inauspicious person. If we take Heaven and Earth as a great furnace and creation as a great smith, where could one go and not be acceptable? Falling asleep, waking suddenly—life and death are but dreams and awakenings. Why then cling to or reject, delight in or loathe?\"\n\nThis passage shows that what the true person attains is far beyond the understanding of ordinary men and women, which is why Zili shouted at them to leave. Only those with true knowledge can be called true persons. One must be like Zilai, following transformation and roaming freely, unmoved by life or death, with nothing to cling to in life or resist in death. Only when one reaches such transcendent and singular mastery, pure and flawless, has one fully accomplished the work of learning. This is what it means to be a great master. Above, it was said that the true person can follow life and death, but how does one attain this? The following passage illustrates this through Zisang Hu and his three companions, who are those beyond the world who have attained the Way. This is the fruit of learning, not something those confined to conventional paths could understand.\n\nZisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Ziqin Zhang became friends, saying to one another, \"Who can join together in non-joining, act together in non-acting? Who can ascend to Heaven, roam in the mists, and wander boundlessly? Who can forget life while living, with no end or limit?\" The three looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord. Thus, they became friends.\n\nAfter a brief while, Zisang Hu died, and before he was buried, Confucius heard of it and sent Zigong to attend to the funeral rites. Some wove cords, others played the zither, and together they sang in harmony: \"Alas, Zisang Hu! Alas, Zisang Hu!\"",

(All people are originally unburdened and transcendent, naturally suspended and free; yet they cannot achieve this release because they bind themselves.) Moreover, things have long been unable to overcome Heaven—what then should I resent? (People are moved by the transformations of creation, for they cannot overcome Heaven. Since they cannot overcome it, they should simply comply—what is there to resent?)",

Those made for water dig ponds to sustain themselves; those made for the Dao find stillness without effort. Thus it is said: fish forget one another in rivers and lakes, just as humans forget one another in the arts of the Dao. To dig a pond and tend to fish is still to labor; to be made for the Dao is to let go and find ease. Hence, without doing, one attains stillness.\"\n\nZigong said, \"May I ask about the *qi*-person?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"The *qi*-person is one who stands apart from others yet moves in harmony with Heaven. Thus it is said: what is a petty man in Heaven’s eyes is a noble man among men; what is a noble man among men is a petty man in Heaven’s eyes. The *qi*-person, though apart from the world, aligns with Heaven. The self-righteous gentleman, bound by his own constraints, cannot roam freely—he may be a noble man among men, yet in Heaven’s eyes, he remains small, for he has not merged with the Way.\"\n\nThis passage shows that even Confucius, a sage within the bounds of the world, could guide others toward the learning of the boundless. It suggests that even those who cling rigidly to conventions may yet be led to the great Dao. If Zigong, with all his wisdom, still stands far from the Way, how much more so others? Below, the text clarifies that the Way of the boundless is not beyond the reach of those within the bounds—only the vulgar fail to recognize it. Thus, it invokes Yan Hui to illustrate the point, as Confucius sought to dispel his confusion. For one like Yan Hui, who loved learning, true mastery and self-realization were indeed within grasp.\n\nYan Hui asked Confucius, \"Mengsun Cai, when his mother died, wept without tears, felt no grief in his heart, and showed no sorrow in mourning. Lacking these three, he yet won fame throughout Lu for his mastery of mourning rites. How could one gain such renown without substance to match it?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Mengsun Cai fulfilled the rites to perfection—he had advanced beyond mere knowledge. Most know only the rituals of the world, but Mengsun had grasped the truth of Heaven. To return to the root is the essence of ritual. He sought to simplify mourning but could not, for custom demands grief. Thus, though he wept, he did so without true sorrow—he had already cast off much of the burden.\n\nMengsun did not know why he lived or why he died. He did not cling to what came before or what came after. Having awakened to the truth of neither birth nor death, he moved through life as if unborn and faced death as if undying. He saw himself as but a thing in the great transformation, awaiting the change he could not know. For how could one who is about to transform know that he will not? And how could one who resists transformation know that he has not already changed?\n\nYou and I are but dreamers who have yet to awaken. He was startled by the form but untouched in spirit—like a piglet fleeing at the sight of its dead mother, yet its nature remained unshaken. His life was but a morning, his body a dwelling; though the form dissolved, the true master endured. Thus, there was a dwelling but no true death. Mengsun alone had awakened to this truth. He wept as others wept, yet his heart was not in it.\"",

To arrange and then dissolve—only then does one enter the vast and singular sky of Dao (this \"vast and singular sky\" is the boundless, undifferentiated heaven of the Great Dao. At first, one’s efforts in Dao cultivation are deliberate, like an arrangement; but when purity is attained and the realm of great transformation is reached, sudden awakening occurs naturally, without contrivance, and one enters of itself).\n\nThis passage speaks of learning beyond the mundane—though even within the world, some may achieve it. Yet amid worldly customs, ordinary minds cannot recognize it; only a true person can truly know. Thus, the Master borrows Yan Hui to awaken the sage. Here lies the most awakening and earnest truth for the world.\n\nThe above speaks of transcending life and death as the ultimate attainment of Dao, which hinges on sudden enlightenment. Below, it says that if one wishes to learn the Dao, one must first cast aside all matters of benevolence and righteousness, reverence and self-importance, wisdom and skill, and long-ingrained habits—only then can one enter the Dao.\n\nYi’erzi went to see Xu You. Xu You asked, “How has Yao instructed you?” Yi’erzi replied, “Yao told me: ‘You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness and clearly distinguish right from wrong.’” Xu You said, “Then why have you come here? (Why have you come at all? This implies you have already been corrupted by Yao’s teachings.) Yao has branded you with benevolence and righteousness (meaning he has marred your original nature with artificial virtue) and mutilated you with right and wrong. How then will you wander in the boundless and carefree realm of transformation?” Yi’erzi said, “Though I cannot enter the depths of the Great Dao, I still wish to wander near its fence.” Xu You said, “Not so. The blind cannot appreciate the beauty of brows and eyes, nor the colorblind discern the patterns of blue and yellow embroidery (meaning your mind is already blind and colorblind, making the Great Dao inaccessible).” Yi’erzi replied, “Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, Ju Liang lost his strength, and the Yellow Emperor forgot his wisdom (speaking of how the perfect person’s skill in saving others can make each lose what they once possessed)—all within the crucible of transformation. How do I know that the Creator will not cease my branding and mend my mutilation, allowing me to ride upon completion and follow you, Master?” Xu You said, “Alas! It cannot yet be known. Let me tell you the general outline (not daring to reveal its full depth, I will speak only of its broad strokes): My teacher! My teacher! (My teacher is the Great Master, beyond comparison with Yao.) He grinds all things to dust yet does not call it righteousness; his blessings extend through ten thousand generations yet he does not call it benevolence (Yao tirelessly promotes benevolence and righteousness, taking the nurturing of all things as his achievement. But the Great Master grinds all things to powder without considering it righteousness, bestows blessings through ten thousand generations without considering it benevolence. In great benevolence, there is no benevolence; in great righteousness, there is no righteousness—this is the meaning of Laozi’s ‘giving life without possessing, acting without relying, growing without dominating’). He is older than high antiquity yet does not call it age; he covers and bears heaven and earth, carves and shapes all forms yet does not call it skill (the Great Dao gave birth to heaven and earth, nurtured all things without intention, thus not claiming any skill). This is the realm in which he wanders!”\n\nThis passage teaches that to learn the Great Dao, one must cast aside all deliberate striving for benevolence, righteousness, reverence, self-importance, wisdom, and skill—only then can one transcend the mysterious and enter the wondrous, wandering freely in the realm of the Great Dao. For benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, and skill are but the tools of fame and gain, the pursuits of the worldly, and true obstacles to the Great Dao.\n\nYan Hui said, “I have made progress.” Confucius asked, “What do you mean?” He replied, “I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness!” Confucius said, “Good, but not yet enough.” Another day, he saw Confucius again and said, “I have made progress.” Confucius asked, “What do you mean?” He replied, “I have forgotten ritual and music!” Confucius said, “Good, but not yet enough.” Another day, he saw Confucius again and said, “I have made progress!” Confucius asked, “What do you mean?”",

This is called *zuowang*.”\nConfucius said, “When merged, there are no preferences (for when self and world are both forgotten, things and I are both empty, all inclinations of acceptance and rejection vanish, hence nothing is favored); when transformed, there is no constancy (for when things and I are both forgotten, form and spirit are wholly transformed—transformed, there is no self, and nothing is not oneself. Thus, one does not cling to the self as constant). Truly (*guo*), you surpass me in virtue! I, Qiu, would follow after you.”\n\nThis passage shows that even those scholars confined to the mundane and partial learning, if they can diminish and forget themselves entirely to merge with the great Dao, will be deferred to even by sages and the wise. It means that such attainment cannot be entered through cleverness or skill. Thus, earlier, Zigong’s ignorance was noted, while now, only Yan Hui can enter.\n\nZiyu and Zisang were friends. After ten days of ceaseless rain, Ziyu said, “Zisang must be suffering (knowing he had nothing to eat)!” He wrapped rice and went to feed him.

Man!”*\nHis voice could not sustain the melody (weak from hunger, his voice failed), and he hurriedly recited his verse (breath short and disjointed, the words of the poem broken by gasps).\nZiyu entered and asked, “Why do you sing like this (why is your song so unmelodic)?”\nZisang replied, “I pondered who has brought me to this extremity, but I cannot find the answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers all without partiality; earth bears all without favor. Would heaven and earth single me out for poverty? I sought the cause, but it cannot be found! Yet to reach this extremity—it is fate (*ming*)!”\n\nThis passage concludes the chapter’s meaning. Yet the chapter discusses the Great Master, so why does it end with *ming*?

      "translated_text": "Yet this Great Master is none other than the Perfected One, the Spirit-Man, and the Sage of the \"Free and Easy Wandering\"—their \"not-knowing as knowing\" is the true knowledge of the \"Equalizing Things,\" the true governor, the master of nurturing life. All the figures in this chapter embody virtue in full measure. These meanings converge in the Great Master, completing the teaching of inner sageliness.\n\nThe following \"Responding to Emperors and Kings\" expresses the intent of outer kingship. In Zhuangzi’s thought, inner sageliness and outer kingship form the substance and function. The Perfected One, the Spirit-Man, and the Sage of the earlier \"Free and Easy Wandering\" are precisely what is meant here by the Great Master. Moreover, it is said that with mere dust, chaff, and husks, one may yet mold and forge a Yao or Shun. Thus it is said: the true Dao is for cultivating the self; its leftover scraps and dregs may be used for the world and the state. Governing the world is but the Sage’s incidental task.\n\nThe first six chapters expound the wonders of the great Dao, while the Great Master is one who has attained the Dao—this is the Sage’s complete embodiment, already realized within oneself. Where there is substance, there must be function; hence \"Responding to Emperors and Kings\" reveals the function of the great Dao. If the Sage’s time and fortune are about to emerge, compelled by necessity to answer the mandate, then he becomes a sagely emperor or enlightened king. Extending its leftover threads, he transforms through non-action, utterly free from deliberate effort or contrivance. This manifests the great function of non-action, and thus the chapter is so named.\n\nNie Que asked Wang Ni four questions, and four times received the answer \"I do not know\" (this chapter takes \"not-knowing\" as its key; this not-knowing is a heart unmoved by the world, indifferent and serene). Nie Que leapt with great joy and went to tell Pu Yi Zi. Pu Yi Zi said: \"Have you only now come to know this?\" (Do you only now realize the wonder of not-knowing?) The Lord of Yu does not compare to the Lord of Tai (hitherto, the world has known only the Lord of Yu as a Sage, unaware that he does not match the Lord of Tai).\n\nThe Lord of Yu still harbors virtue to entice others (this speaks of the Lord of Yu’s inadequacy. For he takes benevolence as goodness and thus deliberately uses benevolence to bind others’ hearts). Though he may win people, he has never emerged from the realm of the unperfected (the Lord of Yu, using benevolence to entice others, may win them, yet cannot forget his merit and fame—this remains a worldly practice, unable to transcend the human realm and awaken to the wonder of the true person’s Dao, thus attaining the state beyond the human).\n\nThe Lord of Tai, in repose, is leisurely and at ease (leisurely, unhurried, and carefree); in waking, he is content and self-possessed. Now he takes himself as a horse, now as an ox. His knowledge is genuine and trustworthy; his virtue is utterly true, yet he has never entered the realm of the unperfected (this speaks of the Lord of Tai’s transcendence over the Lord of Yu: emptying his heart to wander through the world, his mind at ease and self-content, forgetting both self and others. If people deceive him as an ox, he responds as an ox; if they call him a horse, he responds as a horse. Never clinging to his own views, he moves with all things. His knowledge is not delusion but awakening to the true nature of things).",

      "translated_text": "The term \"genuine and trustworthy\" refers to the essence of the Dao. As previously stated, \"possessing genuineness and trustworthiness\" describes this essence. When its virtue and function are utterly true, they are not tainted by human artifice. Thus, one transcends mundane sentiments, abides in the realm beyond the human of the great Dao, yet does not fall into mere emptiness. Moreover, one harmonizes with the world’s dust and radiance without ever confining oneself to narrow self-restraint. Such is the marvel of the Lord of Tai.

Hence it is said he has never entered the realm of the unperfected.\n\nJian Wu met the madman Jie Yu. Jie Yu asked, \"What did Ri Zhongshi tell you?\" Jian Wu replied, \"He told me that a ruler of men issues constant laws as standards and measures, employing rightness to regulate the people. Who would dare not listen and be transformed?\" Jie Yu said, \"This is deceptive virtue. If a ruler relies on his own ability to govern and deceives the people into compliance, it is as futile as crossing the sea to dig a river or commanding a mosquito to bear a mountain. The governance of the sage does not consist in external control. Only after rectifying himself does he act, enabling each to rectify their own nature. As Laozi said, 'In clarity and stillness, he rectifies all under heaven.' Truly, each is capable of their own affairs. Human nature is originally endowed by the great Dao, complete and self-sufficient, with no need for the slightest human intervention.

      "translated_text": "Moreover, birds soar high to evade the harm of arrows and nets, while moles burrow deep beneath the sacred mounds of the earth altars to escape the peril of fumigation and excavation. Yet are these two creatures truly without awareness? Birds and moles, by their inborn nature, act as they must; it is only human cunning that seeks to capture them, compelling them to flee aloft or hide below. How then can one claim these creatures lack understanding? The people’s nature is like that of birds and moles—if a ruler governs with deliberate intent, can they not but be startled and take flight?\n\nThe *Outer Chapters*’ \"Horse’s Hooves\" vividly illustrates this point. These two passages argue that governing the world cannot be achieved through deliberate effort, reliance on knowledge, or self-aggrandizement. If one instead embraces non-action, the people will naturally transform. As Laozi said, *\"I practice non-action, and the people transform of themselves\"* and *\"In clarity and stillness, he rectifies all under heaven.\"* If one imposes laws to control the people, they will not only resist but, like birds and moles, be alarmed and flee.\n\nTian Gen was wandering in Yin Yang when he reached the banks of the Liao River. There, he encountered an unnamed man and asked, *\"May I inquire how to govern the world?\"* The unnamed man replied, *\"Away with you! You are a crude man—why do you ask so hastily? I am about to become human through the Creator (abiding by the transformations of nature, not acting with worldly intent). If I grow weary, I shall ride the boundless bird of the Dao, soaring beyond the six directions to wander in the realm of Nothingness, the vast and limitless wilds. Why should governing the world trouble my heart?\"*\n\nTian Gen pressed further, and the unnamed man said, *\"Let your mind wander in stillness, harmonize your qi with emptiness, follow the natural course of things without imposing private designs, and the world will be governed. Only thus will all under heaven be well-ordered.\"* This passage directly reveals the subtlety of governing through non-action, urging rulers to emulate the effortless transformation of high antiquity.\n\nYang Ziju visited Lao Dan and said, *\"Suppose there were a man here who, in his eagerness to pursue the Dao, is swift and resolute, penetrating and clear-minded in all matters, and tireless in his studies—could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?\"* Lao Dan replied, *\"Such a man, when measured against a sage, is like a convict laboring in shifts, a craftsman bound to his trade, or a merchant shackled to the marketplace—his body toils and his heart trembles. A man so swift and resolute is like those forced laborers, endlessly occupied, his body and mind exhausted. How could such a one govern the people? Moreover, the patterns on tigers and leopards invite hunting; the agility of apes and the skill of hunting dogs bring them to be tethered. If such a man could be compared to an enlightened king, then apes and hunting dogs could be as well.\"*\n\nYang Ziju, his expression changing, asked, *\"Then may I inquire how an enlightened king governs?\"* Lao Dan said, *\"The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover all under heaven, yet he does not claim them as his own; he bestows transformation upon the myriad things, yet the people do not rely on him. His merit is too vast to be named, and he allows each thing to delight in itself, as if to say, ‘What has the ruler’s power to do with me?’ He stands in the unfathomable and wanders in the realm of Nothingness—this is the essence of Laozi’s ‘acting without presuming’ and ‘not asserting dominion.’\"*",

      "translated_text": "This passage expounds upon the governance of an enlightened king, further clarifying Laozi’s intent to reveal the foundational principles of his teachings. It extols the Great Master, who manifests in the world as a sagely emperor or enlightened king, enacting the transformative power of non-action. Above, it was said that the enlightened king \"stands in the unfathomable and wanders in the realm of Nothingness\"—only thus can he respond to the world and govern all under heaven. Yet what is this \"unfathomable\" realm, and can one learn to attain it?\n\nThus, below, Master Huzǐ is introduced as a man of the unfathomable, and what he reveals to the spirit-diviner exemplifies the unfathomable state. When Liezi witnessed this, he desired to learn, for he was such a person.\n\nIn the state of Zheng, there was a spirit-diviner named Ji Xian, who could discern a person’s life and death, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early demise—predicting the year, month, or even the day with divine accuracy. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled in fear, dreading his revelations of ill fate. Liezi, however, was entranced upon meeting him and, returning home, told Huzǐ, his master: *\"At first, I believed your Way to be supreme, yet now I see there is something even greater.\"*\n\nHuzǐ replied: *\"What I have taught you is merely the outward form, not yet the true essence. Do you truly believe you have attained the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs? Just as creatures require both male and female to reproduce, so too do people’s fortunes arise from the interplay of opposing forces. If the mind could transcend such duality, how could a diviner read your fate? Yet you, in your eagerness to prove your mastery of the Dao, compete with the world, seeking validation. Thus, others can read you. Come tomorrow and bring him to me—let him observe me.\"*\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to meet Huzǐ. Afterward, the diviner emerged and said to Liezi in astonishment: *\"Alas! Your master is already dead! He cannot live! He will not last ten days! I saw something strange—his face was like damp ashes, utterly devoid of life.\"*\n\nLiezi entered, his tears soaking his robe, and told Huzǐ what he had heard. Huzǐ said: *\"Earlier, I showed him the ‘earthly pattern’—the state of stillness grounded in the most tranquil realm. Like a seed yet to sprout, it neither stirs nor manifests. This is akin to the Buddhist practice of *śamatha-vipaśyanā*, the method of calming the mind. The ‘earthly pattern’ is the mind settled in perfect stillness, where not a single thought arises, nor any movement or display. All mental activity is extinguished, which is why his face appeared like damp ashes, lifeless. He mistook my cessation of vital energy for death. Bring him again tomorrow.\"*\n\nThe following day, Liezi once more brought Ji Xian to see Huzǐ.",

His merit is too vast to be named, and he allows each thing to delight in itself, as if to say, ‘What has the ruler’s power to do with me?’ He stands in the unfathomable and wanders in the realm of Nothingness—this is the essence of Laozi’s ‘acting without presuming’ and ‘not asserting dominion.’\"*",

Ji Xian emerged and said to Liezi: *\"Your master is unsettled—his spirit wanders, his complexion shifts. I cannot read him.

Huzǐ said: *\"Earlier, I showed him the ‘Great Thoroughfare’—the state of supreme emptiness where nothing prevails.

Huzǐ said: *\"Pursue him!\"* Liezi chased him but could not catch up. He returned and reported to Huzǐ: *\"He has vanished! He is gone! I could not reach him!\"*\n\nHuzǐ said: *\"Earlier, I showed him what has never departed from my root—Dao’s primordial source.

Though enmeshed in the boundaries of form, he remained thus to the end.\n\nThis passage illustrates how the enlightened ruler abides in the unfathomable, transforming through non-action.

      "translated_text": "Thus, he specially presented Master Huzi as the embodiment of such a person, and what was revealed to the spirit-diviner exemplified the unfathomable realm. Only one who abides in such a state of mind can engage with the world, be called an enlightened ruler, and transform through non-action—how could others even approximate this? Such false learning may be cultivated to attainment, but only if one truly believes and puts it into practice. Liezi was one who aspired to and trusted in the Dao. This exhortation to the world defies description.\n\nThe above speaks of Huzi merely to illustrate the unfathomable realm. What follows further elaborates on its application in engaging with the world:\n\nDo not be the steward of fame (for *shi* means \"to preside\"; the true person must first forget fame, hence the warning against becoming its steward). Do not be the repository of schemes (for *moufu* denotes the gathering place of cunning plans; one must act without intention, not making strategy one’s concern). Do not take on affairs as a burden (one must not forcibly assume responsibilities, for to bear them is to invite trouble; rather, respond to matters as if they arose from another). Do not make knowledge your master (for *zhizhu* means to take cleverness as one’s guide; one must follow things with a forgetful heart, not letting wit dominate).\n\nEmbody the boundless (to *ti* is to realize the great Dao, responding and transforming without end) and wander without trace (for *zhen* means \"sign\"; to wander in the origin of nothingness is to rest the mind where not a single thought arises). Fully enact what you have received from Heaven, yet perceive no gain (merely fulfill what Heaven has bestowed, preserving the whole without loss, and without any sense of attainment)—this is but emptiness (thus it returns to emptiness alone, with not the slightest addition).\n\nThe mind of the perfected person acts like a mirror: it neither anticipates nor welcomes, responds without retention, and thus can master things without harm (the perfected person’s mind is like a bright mirror, reflecting whatever comes before it without premeditation or anticipation. When things arrive, beauty and ugliness are clearly seen, yet no trace of them is retained, and no judgment of right or wrong remains. Responding to the world with such emptiness, one can master things, and nothing can ultimately harm them—for this is the perfection of emptiness).\n\nAll the preceding descriptions of the true person’s many states and practices culminate in the twenty-two characters from \"the perfected person\" onward. Herein lies the entirety of Zhuangzi’s learning, effort, efficacy, and application. All else he presents is but elaboration. The meaning of the Inner Chapters is fully contained here. For scholars seeking realization, there is no need for more—merely begin with these few words, and one may respond to things with a forgetful heart, reaping boundless benefit for a lifetime. This is what is called \"free and easy wandering.\"\n\nThe Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Central Realm was Hundun. Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s territory, and Hundun treated them very well. They conspired to repay his kindness, saying, “All people have seven apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only he has none. Let us try to bore them for him.” Each day they chiseled one aperture, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.\n\n(Shu and Hu represent the sudden arising of existence from nothingness—the moment when, at the beginning of the great transformation, one first receives form. Hundun signifies the state shortly after form appears, when consciousness and perception are still absent, a time of undifferentiated, unknowing simplicity. As the apertures of perception are daily chiseled open and knowledge awakens, primordial integrity is lost—hence the saying, “Each day they chiseled one aperture, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.” Some commentators associate Shu with fire, Hu with water, and Hundun with earth, which seems plausible but risks over-interpretation. The present explanation suffices.)\n\nThis chapter on Shu and Hu not only concludes the “Fit for Emperors and Kings” but in fact encapsulates the central meaning of all seven Inner Chapters. The earlier discussion of “free and easy wandering” ultimately returns to the “Great and Venerable Teacher.” The repeated references to petty knowledge harming life, to nourishing form while forgetting life’s essence, to being harmed by things—all these failures to attain freedom stem from the error of knowledge and cleverness. They all result from the chiseling open of Hundun and the loss of primordial integrity. Indeed, from ancient times to the present, in the vast expanse between heaven and earth, not a single person since Yao and Shun has avoided being one who chisels open Hundun. This is but a parable for the fact that all people in the world are deluded and ignorant, universally so. To the common eye, it may seem absurd, yet not a word of it fails to express a heart of salvation and compassion for the lost. How could one regard it merely as literature? The reader must perceive its intent.\n\nEven this interpretation is not forced or contrived, for it follows the text’s own principles to grasp its authorial purpose. If one cross-references it with the *zhiguan* of the human and heavenly vehicles in Buddhist teachings—as the *Zongjing lu* also states—what Laozi and Zhuangzi espoused as the Dao of natural purity and non-action corresponds to the luminous meditation of the first dhyāna heaven. May my fellow practitioners not mistakenly assume that I am improperly equating it with Buddhism.",
