Assembling the multitude of immortals, they expounded the wondrous Dharma of True Unity, manifesting great majestic power and spreading vast auspicious radiance. Universally illuminating the boundless worlds, they revealed to all sentient beings the karmic conditions of good and evil, enabling them to know the retributions of past lives, the rewards of merit and sin, and the consequences of the Three Times.\n\nThereupon, the celestial great sages burned incense and prostrated in audience, arraying themselves in ranks to attend and listen to the Dharma-sound. The Primordial Celestial Venerable emitted nine-colored divine light, penetrating and illuminating all heavens below and the myriad lands. His majestic spirit transformed, pervading without obstruction, as clear as if held in the palm of the hand. The assembled immortals to his left and right, riding this majestic radiance, beheld the heavens and the karmic conditions of good and evil, both inner and outer, fully revealed.\n\nThey saw great sages and lofty perfected ones, their necks bearing circular aureoles, their forms adorned with wondrous marks—some riding upon light and traversing the void, soaring on dragons and driving cranes, treading clouds and pacing the emptiness, or journeying in simurgh-drawn chariots with phoenix canopies, roaming the Eight Extremes in carefree nonaction, their divine transformations self-mastered. Some beheld celestial and terrestrial immortals, golden lads and jade maidens, innumerable multitudes, blessed with happiness and joy. Some saw immortals bearing banners and holding tablets, burning incense and scattering flowers, multiplying their forms in transformation. Some saw flying celestial deva-kings and karmic youths, patrolling the human realm, recording good and evil to report to the heavens. Some saw the palaces of the sun and moon, the jeweled abodes of the stellar lodges, and the numinous officials of mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks, examining the people, assessing their good and evil deeds and merits, without the slightest error.\n\nThen, the Ten Flower Perfected Ones, together with the celestial great sages, burned incense and prostrated in audience, ascending to address the Most Venerable: \"Today, we have been granted the honor of attending this jeweled pavilion, beholding and hearing this wondrous assembly. Humbly standing at your side, we pray that you manifest your majestic power, erect a great Dharma-bridge, and guide all beings, that they may attain the Dao and forever transcend the delusions of the dust.\"\n\nThereupon, the Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side: \"You, the assembled immortals, follow my auspicious radiance and descend to observe the myriad lands and the earth, the mountains and rivers, and the multitudes of people, witnessing the retributions of good and evil. Those who establish meritorious deeds and broadly cultivate fields of blessing shall each receive the blessings of the heavens and humanity.\n\nThey saw emperors, empresses, generals, and ministers burning incense in the main halls, widely convening Dharma-assemblies, observing fasts and offering libations, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rites for the sake of all humans and devas to avert calamities and pray for blessings. They saw emperors, empresses, generals, and ministers humbling themselves before all beings, generously offering a hundred treasures to worship the heavens. They saw emperors, empresses, generals, and ministers establishing palaces and temples, sculpting sacred images, reciting scriptures and prostrating in worship to broadly seek blessings and benefits for all humans and devas. They saw emperors, empresses, generals, and ministers dispersing wealth and treasures to relieve the poor, the aged, the sick, and the destitute. They saw emperors, empresses, generals, and ministers constantly practicing compassion, refraining from killing or harming, avoiding extravagance and waste, and always practicing frugality.\n\nThey saw worthy Daoists constructing numinous temples and stellar altars, copying scriptures and crafting images. They saw worthy Daoists abstaining from grains and fasting, purifying body and mind, reciting and studying scriptures. They saw worthy Daoists releasing life to extend longevity, aiding and benefiting the impoverished. They saw worthy Daoists diligently striving toward the stellar Han to seek lightness and ascension. They saw worthy Daoists loyal to their lords and filial to their parents, compassionate and loving toward friends.\n\nThey saw emperors, kings, civil and military ministers hunting and killing, harming and injuring the common people. They saw emperors, kings, civil and military ministers imposing cruel and harsh punishments, oppressing the people. They saw emperors, kings, civil and military ministers indulging in lust and desire, unrestrained in the six senses, feasting and reveling without moderation. They saw emperors, kings, civil and military ministers destroying palaces and temples, burning and demolishing Dharma-halls. They saw emperors, kings, civil and military ministers disdaining monastics, humiliating Dharma-teachers, inflicting pain and punishment. They saw emperors, kings, civil and military ministers slighting Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, and the stellar lodges, poisoning and harming the virtuous. They saw men and women slandering the Dharma-body of monastics, engaging in licentious acts within temples, killing living creatures, and defiling sacred grounds. They saw men and women killing their parents, committing the five heinous acts of unfiliality, defying Heaven and betraying Earth, disbelieving in sin and merit. They saw men and women stealing the permanent possessions of the Three Treasures—offerings of wealth, flowers, fruits, banners, and canopies. They saw men and women betraying the Dao and rebelling against their teachers, violating vows and breaking oaths, deceiving others to settle debts. They saw men and women bound in willow locks and imprisoned, whipped, beaten, and tortured, their bodies maimed. They saw men and women with incomplete six senses, mute, deaf, or dumb, their hands and feet crippled and contracted. They saw men and women foolish, dull, and witless, afflicted with leprosy or madness. They saw men and women devoured or stung by venomous insects and fierce beasts. They saw men and women separated midway in life, not fulfilling their bonds with kin. They saw men and women torn from their mothers, sold into slavery. They saw men and women with bodies split open, rotting with maggots and festering with pus and blood.\n\nThey further saw hells where feet tread upon knife-mountains, limbs severed and bodies broken. They saw hells where hands grasp sword-trees, limbs and joints torn asunder. They saw hells where fire is swallowed and coals are eaten, smoke issuing from the entire body. They saw hells where pestles pound, mills grind, and bodies are reduced to dust. They saw hells where bodies embrace copper pillars, forms scorched and withered.\"\n\nThey further saw hells where bodies lie upon iron beds, fat melting and flesh burning. They saw hells where cauldrons boil, bodies stewed and dissolved into rot. They saw hells where saws split the form, blood streaming from the entire body. They saw hells where pressing rocks crush the frame, blood bursting from every pore. They saw hells where bodies sink in freezing ice, the entire form cracking and splitting. They saw hells where fire-mountains rest upon the head, face and body scorched and withered. They saw hells where iron birds peck out the eyes, skin and flesh torn asunder. They saw hells where tongues are pulled out, pierced by iron awls. They saw hells where dark waves are drawn and poured to flood the four rivers. They saw hells where stones are carried to fill rivers, laboring day and night without respite.\n\nThey further saw beings reborn as hungry ghosts. They saw beings reborn as the six kinds of livestock—oxen, sheep, swine, and dogs. They saw beings reborn among border tribes and lowly outcasts. They saw beings reborn with the six afflictions—deafness, blindness, muteness, dumbness, withered hands, and lame feet. They saw beings reborn as insects, beasts, flies, and gnats. They saw beings reborn as filth-dwelling worms in the mire. They saw beings reborn as noxious creatures—birds, beasts, fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs.\n\nAt that time, all the great sages and divine immortals in the Dharma assembly beheld such karmic retributions and causal conditions throughout the heavens and the earth, where sin and blessing differ. They knew not what cultivation in past lives had led to present transgressions, nor what blessings in past lives had brought present suffering. Some were seeds sown in former lives, calamity flowing to descendants; others were offenses accumulated in a single lifetime, bearing this karmic retribution. They prostrated and entreated the Heavenly Worthy in great compassion to bestow awakening, that all sentient beings might comprehend the causal conditions of past lives, the retribution of sin and blessing, the rewards and punishments of the heavens—every detail without deviation. If they aroused the mind to seek deliverance and followed the sacred words, all would attain liberation.\n\nThe Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy again addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side: \"If in the world below there are perfected persons and faithful disciples who arouse the unsurpassed Dao-mind, greatly bestow wealth and treasure to relieve the destitute, release creatures to extend their lives, erect wondrous seven-jeweled terraces, establish images of the Three Clarities, observe precepts and burn incense, and hold grand jiao rites to honor the hundred numina of heaven and earth, the stellar hosts of the celestial palaces, and offer a hundred precious offerings, I shall dispatch the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion and Salvation from Suffering to open the cinnabar-script purple texts in the Supreme Ultimate Palace, proclaim the august names of the Heavenly Worthies, extol and chant the cavernous hymns, and entreat the erasure of the souls languishing in the nine dark hells of eternal night, releasing the toils and entanglements of sin endured by their ancestors and parents through kalpas past. All shall be absolved and released, their souls ascending to the heavenly halls, where they shall wander carefree, their clothing and sustenance naturally provided. Their boundless blessings shall increase, their boundless sins shall dissolve. Their merit shall be towering, and all shall attain liberation.\"\n\nThus, in burning incense, they return their bodies and devote their lives, prostrating with the five limbs to the ground.

Heavenly Masters, dispatching the Perfected of the Jade Clarity to descend into the world below, scattering them across the ten thousand states and nine provinces, to be transmitted, transcribed, and recited in worship. Should there be those who cultivate the True, or people who gather blessings—whether on the eight seasonal nodes, the Three Origins, or their own birthdays—who, for the sake of the emperor or the lord of the realm, burn incense, scatter flowers, offer rare and wondrous fruits, perform grand jiao rites to the stars, and make offerings to the sacred mountains and cavern-heavens, as well as to the divine immortals who have attained the Dao, they shall secure the peace and prosperity of the nation, ensuring its endurance with Heaven, bringing harmony to the myriad realms, and uniting the four seas under a common culture.\"\n\nThe divine ascends to the Golden Gates, their names inscribed in the Jade Clarity. The heavens are free of defilement, and the ten thousand states enjoy perfect peace. Their merit towers high, their blessings and felicity boundless.\n\nWith sincere devotion, we bow in reverence to:\nthe Immortal Officers of the Xiaoyou Qingxu Grotto-Heaven of Wangwu Mountain,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Dayou Kongming Grotto-Heaven of Weiyu Mountain,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Taixuan Jizhen Grotto-Heaven of Xiyu Mountain,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Sanxuan Jizhen Grotto-Heaven of Xixuan Mountain,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Baoxian Jiutai Grotto-Heaven of Qingcheng Mountain,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Shangqing Yuping Grotto-Heaven of Tiantai Mountain,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Zhuming Yaozhen Grotto-Heaven of Luofu Mountain,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Jintan Huayang Grotto-Heaven of Maoshan,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Zuoshen Youxu Grotto-Heaven of Linwu Mountain,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Shende Yinxuan Grotto-Heaven of Kuocang Mountain,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Huolin Grotto-Heaven of Huotong Mountain,\nthe Azure Thearch True Lord of Mount Tai, the Eastern Marchmount,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Pengxuan Taikong Grotto-Heaven,\nthe Vermilion Thearch True Lord of Mount Heng, the Southern Marchmount,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Zhuling Taixu Grotto-Heaven,\nthe White Thearch True Lord of Mount Hua, the Western Marchmount,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Taiji Zongxian Grotto-Heaven,\nthe Dark Thearch True Lord of Mount Chang, the Northern Marchmount,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Taiyi Zongxuan Grotto-Heaven,\nthe Yellow Thearch True Lord of Mount Song, the Central Marchmount,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Shangdi Sizhen Grotto-Heaven,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Xuling Taimiao Grotto-Heaven of Mount Emei,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Xianling Yongzhen Grotto-Heaven of Mount Lu,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Chishui Grotto-Heaven of Mount Siming,\nthe Immortal Officers of the Jixuan Grotto-Heaven of Mount Yangming.\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable once more addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side: \"I now scatter this scripture across the ten thousand states and nine provinces, and the worlds of the ten directions. Should there be those who uphold the Dao, who arouse the unsurpassed intention for the Dao, and on the days of the Three Origins and eight seasonal nodes, for the sake of the emperor, the lord of the realm, or the heir apparent and crown prince, burn incense and bow in reverence, reciting the precious titles of the Three Clarities and the names of the Celestial Venerables and perfected ones, they shall secure the peace of the imperial throne, preserving the enduring harmony of Heaven, ensuring their line shall never be severed, and that they shall forever remain sovereigns of the people.\"\n\nMaster Chongmiao prostrated in thanks before the Celestial Venerable of the Golden Gates and offered this hymn of praise:\n\"The Celestial Venerable bestows his mandate,\nHis sagely calculations stretch far and long.\nGolden branches flourish,\nJade leaves ever fragrant.\nThe Five Stars follow their order,\nThe Seven Luminaries cast their radiance.\nResplendent and glorious,\nThe wondrous celestial verses resound through the void.\nBless our sagely emperor,\nHis precious throne without end.\nHeaven is clear, Earth is tranquil,\nThe myriad realms shine with brilliance.\"\n\n*Thus concludes the first fascicle of The Supreme Numinous Treasure Repentance for Audience with Heaven and Atonement for Transgressions.*\n\n*The second fascicle of The Supreme Numinous Treasure Repentance for Audience with Heaven and Atonement for Transgressions begins.*\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Venerable, at the beginning of the Red Clarity Kalpa, in the Upper Palace of the Fire Refinement within the Southern Vermilion Open Yang of the Great Luo Heaven of Jade Clarity, convened a grand assembly of the host of immortals. The Celestial Thearchs of the four directions, the boundless heavenly beings, jade lads and jade maidens, holding talismans and bearing tablets, burned incense and scattered flowers. They chanted the verses of the grottoes, circling the wondrous terrace of the celestial treasures. Dragon candles and phoenix lamps were arrayed in rows, illuminating the Most Honored One.\n\nThe sacred virtue towers sublime; yet we have never beheld it. At that time, the Primordial Celestial Venerable, with great majestic power, spread vast auspicious radiance, universally illuminating the ten directions. In the boundless lands, all became of one appearance—inner and outer opened and pervaded, like lapis lazuli, pure and luminous without obstruction. The great sages of the ten directions and all attendant perfected beings, following the Most Honored One’s auspicious light, descended to behold the ten directions, the myriad lands, the nine provinces, mountains and rivers, the great earth, the suffering and joy of the people, hells and heavens, the retribution of sins and blessings, all as if before their very eyes.\n\nAt that time, the divine kings of the heavens and the spirit officials of the Three Bureaus arrayed themselves in ranks to pay homage. They presented the registers of the sins and blessings of the lands and peoples of the world, each clearly distinguished, without error or omission. Then, the Perfected of Jade Clarity and the Perfected of Golden Splendor, along with all the immortals in the assembly, burned incense and bowed in reverence, prostrating before the Most Honored One. Today, we humbly partake in this Dharma feast, beholding the compassionate radiance, listening to the Dharma’s sound, awakening the deluded in the dust, and universally guiding them to realize the Dao—truly, this is our long-accumulated blessing.\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the attendant perfected beings at his side: \"I have often descended from the Jade Clarity Heaven to observe all the myriad people. Those who accumulate goodness and revere blessings all receive their due retribution. I see those who broadly create scriptures and images, establish temples to deliver people, practice almsgiving and fasting, relieve the living and deliver the dead, universally saving all—such beings are reborn as kings in heavenly realms, as rulers of kingdoms. Those who make offerings to the Three Treasures, burn incense and light lamps, recite scriptures and pay homage, widely establish fields of blessing, and rescue from disasters and hardships—such beings are reborn as queens and mothers of nations. Those who joyfully believe in the scriptures and Dharma, uphold fasting and contemplate the Dao, and give alms to the poor—such beings are reborn in wealthy, noble, and wise forms. Those who constantly practice compassion, relieve the living and deliver the dead, revere the Three Treasures, and never cease burning incense—such beings are reborn in pure, renunciate forms. Those who believe, practice, and make offerings to the stars—such beings are reborn with long lives, purity, and upright beauty. Those who complete temples and establish sacred altars—such beings are reborn in great wealth, nobility, and wisdom. Those who give alms to relieve the poor and accomplish merit without stint—such beings are reborn among heavenly beings. Those who do not kill, steal, envy, or harm—such beings are reborn with long lives and complete faculties. Those who make offerings to the Three Treasures, cherish all beings, and practice compassion toward creatures—such beings are reborn in lofty, noble, and exalted forms. Those whose descendants flourish, with long lives and wealth—such blessings arise from making offerings to the Celestial Venerable, the Great Dao, and the stars. Those whose couples are harmonious and whose sons and daughters are gentle and obedient—such blessings arise from never severing love and affection. Those who are respected and revered wherever they go, enjoying sweet food and fine clothing—such blessings arise from revering heaven and earth and faithfully honoring the Three Treasures. Those who are nobly exalted in this life, feared by all—such\n\nThose who indulge excessively in alcohol and favor pungent, foul, and filthy foods—such beings in this life suffer madness and are consumed by raging fire, and in past lives were reborn as apes and monkeys. They descend into hell, plunged into cauldrons of boiling liquid.\n\nMoreover, all beings who in this life have severed or crippled limbs, clenched and withered hands, or lame and crooked feet—such afflictions arise from disrespecting the Three Treasures and the stars. Those who are blind in both eyes or whose tongues fester and rot—such afflictions arise from slandering the scriptures and belittling the Three Treasures. Those who are mute and unable to speak, or whose noses are blocked and cannot smell—such afflictions arise from deceiving the ordained and disbelieving the scriptures and Daoist teachings. Those whose eyebrows fall out, lips curl back, tongues loll, or noses collapse—such afflictions arise from destroying sacred altars and slandering the Three Treasures. Those who are deranged, deluded, and grotesque in appearance—such afflictions arise from arrogance, contempt, and mockery of the ordained and the Dharma-body.\n\nThose who encounter bandits and have their possessions harmed—such misfortune arises from plundering the Three Treasures and the permanent endowments of the sacred. Those who drown in water or are harmed by fish and dragons—such misfortune arises from damaging the permanent endowments of the Three Treasures. Those who are burned and scorched by fire or devoured by venomous snakes—such misfortune arises from killing the ordained and demolishing monasteries. Those who have venomous creatures enter their mouths and vomit blood and filth—such afflictions arise from cursing with foul speech and invoking malevolent spirits. Those who have venomous creatures enter their orifices, are devoured by tigers and wolves, or are harmed by fierce beasts—such misfortune arises from secret schemes, poisonous malice, and deceitful hearts.\n\nThose whose parents, spouses, and children are separated, never living together, and constantly quarreling day and night—such misfortune arises from jealousy, adultery, breaking others’ harmony, and severing others’ flesh and blood.

Those reborn as barbarians of lowly status, bald and with severed hair, deep-set eyes, long noses, and foul-smelling bodies—such rebirths arise from killing living beings, sexual misconduct, and disbelief in karmic causes and conditions.\n\nThe Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning addressed the attendant perfected beings at his side: \"The sins and karmic retributions described above condemn beings to hell, where they endure various tortures and punishments, suffering through kalpas before obtaining these forms.

Thus shall they welcome auspiciousness, gather blessings, protect life, and prolong existence. Should there be faithful men and women who, upon the Three Origins and Eight Festivals, burn incense and circumambulate, revering the precious names of the Three Purities and the ranks of the Golden Flower Perfected, offering prayers for the empress, noble consorts, the crown prince, and imperial kin—worshipping and making offerings—they shall gather blessings and prolong life, perpetually illuminating the precious calendar, generation after generation without end, eternally dwelling in the Purple Court.\"\n\nThe Master of Subtle Wonder burned incense, prostrated in gratitude before the Golden Portal of the Celestial Venerable, and offered this hymn of praise:\n*\"The Sacred Mother of the Western Numinosity,\nAdorned with jade pendants, noble and resplendent.\nFrom the Phoenix Pavilion and the Simurgh Terrace,\nShe secretly attends the imperial carriage.\nRainbow light pierces the Dipper,\nThe moon gleams in the Great Void.\nWithin the solemn and pure palace precincts,\nShe eternally guards the celestial abode.\"*\n\nHere ends the second fascicle of *The Supreme Lingbao Repentance Before Heaven for Atonement of Sins*.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Venerable of the Origin was in the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, within the Jade Capital and Golden Portal, seated upon the Heavenly Treasure Wondrous Terrace. Together with the Most High Jade Maid of the Dawn and the Most High Sagely Ancestor, the Most High and Venerable Lord Lao, he assembled the multitude of immortals to expound the wondrous Dharma and lecture on the scriptures and precepts. At that moment, the great sages of all heavens and all the assembled Perfected Ones burned incense, scattered flowers, held banners and staffs, chanted the cavernous hymns, and paced the void in praise. Their merit and virtue were towering, unheard of and unseen before. Today, they had the fortune to approach the precious hall, array themselves in ranks, and stand in attendance, reverently listening to the Dharma sounds, hoping to receive liberation and deliverance.\n\nThen, the Primordial Celestial Venerable of the Origin addressed the attendant Perfected Ones on his left and right, saying: \"With my awe-inspiring radiance, I universally illuminate the boundless worlds, the multitudes of the lower realms, and all sentient beings. Yet they remain foolish, benighted, and sunk in the snares of the world, mired in the six desires, unable to awaken. Constantly abiding in suffering and affliction, they drift and wander through the cycles of birth and death, never attaining enlightenment. Should there be faithful men and women who arouse the supreme intention of the Dao, on behalf of all sentient beings, establishing the precious altars of the Three Purities and the sacred altars of the Five Emperors, hanging banners and offering flowers, burning incense and prostrating in reverence, reciting scriptures and repenting; for their ancestral kin, deceased parents, wives, children, and family members, they may extinguish transgressions, purify body and mind, constantly savor the numinous sounds, avoid falling into evil destinies, and steadfastly practice devotion, repenting for past and present lives.\"\n\nWhen the mind is raised and set in motion, should it harbor disbelief, slander the Three Treasures, defile the Three Treasures, mock the Three Treasures, revile the Three Treasures, curse the Three Treasures, deceive or neglect the Three Treasures, display arrogance toward the Three Treasures, or speak coarsely of the Three Treasures; disparage scriptures and registers, debate their authenticity, alter them with falsehoods, argue over right and wrong, distinguish between deep and shallow, discuss their merits and flaws, present oneself in impurity, wear unclean garments, have unclean hands and feet, foul breath, consume wine and meat, partake of pungent and rank foods, utter filthy words, or lack reverence in the heart—\n\nOr fail to cleanse the hands, omit burning incense, neglect rinsing the mouth or bathing, and thus enter the sacred altar, offending the honored images, defiling the true immortals, divine sages, Heavenly Kings, Valiant Guardians, Jade Maidens, Golden Lads, and Altar Guardians; or show disrespect toward the scriptures and teachings of the Three Clarities and the Perfected, or toward ordained Dharma masters, displaying arrogance and refusing to believe and uphold—\n\nOr ride horses and carriages directly into temples and sacred altars, approaching the honored images too closely, desecrating the blessed grounds; or upon seeing others observe fasts and receive precepts, persist in disbelief; or upon witnessing rituals, scripture recitations, or offerings, disrupt and dismiss them as delusions; or enter the Daoist sanctuary and speak loudly, disturbing the assembly; or speak and act with intent to debate right and wrong, compare truth and falsehood; or rely on the Three Treasures to seek wealth through deceit; or falsely teach the Dharma to deceive the people; or misuse the wealth of the Three Treasures to sustain oneself; or threaten and intimidate monastics to extort their possessions, supporting wives and children—\n\nSuch transgressions are boundless and immeasurable. Today, with a sincere heart laid bare, we bow in repentance to Heaven and Earth, the Three Treasures, and the stars, on behalf of our ancestral parents and living kin, kneeling in earnest supplication to beseech the eradication of sins, purifying inner and outer, that all may attain deliverance.\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Dao again addressed the attendant immortals at his side: \"I grieve for the multitudes of the lower realms, still dwelling in the world, whose three karmas and six senses bear the weight of grave offenses. They persist in killing, inflicting cruel suffering, devoid of compassion, slaughtering creatures great and small, consuming the six livestock. For the sake of parents, themselves, siblings, spouses, children, extended kin, and village gatherings, they harm countless beings without reckoning.\n\nThey kill cattle, sheep, donkeys, horses, pigs, dogs, chickens, and domesticated livestock; or deer, foxes, hares, tigers, leopards, and wild beasts of the mountains and forests; or geese, ducks, birds, magpies, turtledoves, hawks, kites, wild ducks, egrets, and flying fowl; or insects, snakes, vipers, scorpions, bees, wasps, centipedes, millipedes, ants, and crawling creatures; or soft-shelled turtles, fish, turtles, snails, clams, frogs, crabs, and water-dwelling beings; or dung beetles, midges, mole crickets, caterpillars, mantises, earthworms, and tiny insects; or mosquitoes, fleas, lice, mayflies, grubs, and creatures born of transformation.\n\nThey hunt with hawks and hounds, set nets and traps, killing countless beings; or set fires to mountains, exhausting forests and draining marshes, slaughtering life; or wield bows, arrows, blades, and staves to kill; or crush with hands and feet, sit or lie upon, killing; or till fields and build walls, killing; or construct houses, dig pits, remove soil, dismantle fences, and erect barriers, killing; or destroy embryos and eggs, pour boiling water on the ground, killing; or kill before scripture images, sacred altars, and temples; or sacrifice to ghosts and spirits, or kill in anger; or take lives in their hands, or die by the blade; or sever heads and limbs, flay skin and fur, roast in fierce fires, boil in scalding water; or separate mother and child, severing their nurturing bond; or utterly destroy their life root, ensuring their annihilation.\n\nThey kill virtuous persons and Daoists, the old and weak, women and men; or kill creditors and enemies; or kill the good and kind in all directions; or kill through fear, coercion, poison, curses, or revilement; or commit suicide or incite others to kill. Such killings, with every movement of hand or body, take countless lives, their offenses boundless and grave, too grievous to hear.\n\nYet today, if there are faithful men and women of the Dao who, with wholehearted sincerity, bow to Heaven in repentance, present memorials and petitions, hold grand offerings to the Three Officials, release life to extend destiny, bestow alms and treasures, relieve the destitute, burn incense and perform the Daoist walk, chant the cavernous scriptures, and circumambulate in repentance—on behalf of their seven generations of ancestors, deceased parents, and all kin—they may wash away sins, reform evil, and purify body and mind. All their prayers shall be fulfilled, all their hopes realized. Their delivered kin shall ascend to the Southern Palace, attain the Dao, and be received by immortals, roaming freely in non-action, their blessings immeasurable.\"\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Dao again addressed the attendant immortals at his side: \"If among the faithful below there are those who, on behalf of aquatic beings—shelled creatures, dragons, fish, turtles, shrimp, snails, clams, and all water-dwelling creatures—establish the precious altars of the Three Clarities and the sacred altars of the Five Emperors, burn incense and light lamps, present memorials and petitions, repenting for the heavy karmic offenses of those dwelling in water, I shall dispatch the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion and Salvation from the Cloud Tower and the Golden Repository of Sacred Scriptures to proclaim the august name of the Heavenly Worthy, that all in Heaven and Earth may praise and chant the cavernous scriptures, meditate on the divine and contemplate the Dao, beseeching the erasure of the records of the Nine Hells and the Long Night. Thus shall all aquatic beings and shelled creatures be liberated from suffering, their boundless sins extinguished, and all attain deliverance.\"\n\nTherefore, with incense burning, one surrenders body and life, prostrating with the five limbs touching the earth.

dispatch the Golden Splendor Perfected One to carry them to the lower realms, scattering them throughout the ten thousand states and nine provinces, so that all people may repent and offer homage in gratitude. If there are faithful and virtuous ones who, upon encountering their life-destiny birthdays, burn incense, chant, and perform rituals to give thanks to Heaven and Earth, the divine immortals of the cavernous palaces will record their names. The divine kings will release them from death, the divine kings will raise them to life, and the divine kings will record their merits, memorializing them to the various heavens. Their wealth and silk will be abundant, and they will forever enjoy peace and security. If they are heirs apparent, princes, or imperial kin, they will welcome auspiciousness and gather blessings.

If there are those who uphold the Dao, and upon encountering the Three Primes, Eight Nodal Days, or their life-destiny birthdays, circumambulate and pay homage to the precious titles of the Three Clarities and the names of the Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, their bodies will be firm and their forms solid, forever preserving longevity, and they will obtain boundless fortune.\"\n\nThe Master of Subtle Wonder burned incense, gave thanks before the Golden Portal of the Supreme Lord, and offered this eulogy:\n\"Emerging in a flourishing and harmonious era,\nDaily I serve before the Most High.\nMy body dwells in the Dragon-Phoenix Palace,\nMy name is enrolled in the registers of the immortals.\nBurning incense, I give thanks for Heaven’s blessings,\nForever chanting the *Xiyi* chapters.\nA thousand lives attain a hundred fortunes,\nRanked among the Pure and Subtle Heavens.\nForever abiding in the carefree realm,\nEternally enjoying the blessings of spontaneity.\"\n\nHere ends the third scroll of *The Supreme Lingbao Repentance for Offering Homage to Heaven and Atoning for Transgressions*.\n\nThe fourth scroll of *The Supreme Lingbao Repentance for Offering Homage to Heaven and Atoning for Transgressions*.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Supreme Lord was in the Jade Capital’s Golden Portal of the Great Luo Heaven, upon the Purple Tenuity Heavenly Terrace. Assembling a great congregation of immortals, he expounded the wondrous Dharma, delivering and saving devas and humans, enabling all to awaken to the Dao, sparing them from manifold sufferings. Manifesting great majestic virtue, he emitted great radiance, universally illuminating the ten thousand states. All karmic consequences of transgressions and blessings were made manifest before their eyes—profound, subtle, and wondrous—offering expedient means to open the path to liberation. All the destitute souls in the hells, suffering immeasurable agony and unbearable torment, were thus addressed.\n\nAnd by this grace, they were rescued and uplifted, no longer drowned in the depths of suffering, all attaining transcendence.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Supreme Lord, in his boundless compassion, further revealed the essential Dao, that both past and future might partake of its benefits. He addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side, saying:\n\n\"Humans receive life from the same single qi; yet upon birth, their fate is bound to the Three Origins. Longevity or premature death, fortune or misfortune, wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness—all arise from karmic conditions of sin and blessing, good and evil, life and death. Each follows the root of their past existence, and all receive retribution according to their karmic power, never deviating, as the shadow follows the form, as the echo answers the sound.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first month of the Upper Origin, the celestial officials of the Heavenly Bureau ascend to the Heavenly Palace, presenting the registers of the world’s sins and blessings. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the Middle Origin, the terrestrial officials of the Earthly Bureau ascend to the Heavenly Palace, presenting the registers of the world’s sins and blessings. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month of the Lower Origin, the aquatic officials of the Water Bureau ascend to the Heavenly Palace, presenting the registers of the world’s sins and blessings.\n\nOn these Three Origin days, together with the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, the Four Bureaus and Five Emperors, the spirits of good and evil, and all divine officials, they ascend to the Golden Palace before the throne of the Primordial Supreme Lord to examine the registers of men and women’s lives and deaths, the karmic conditions of sin and blessing, and the black ledgers of names from the Nine Dark Hells and the Watery Prison of destitute souls.\n\nAt this time, if there are faithful men and women who awaken to the natural Daoist intent, constructing Purple Tenuity treasure terraces, Jade Capital treasure mountains, pavilions and towers adorned with a hundred treasures, offering incense and flowers, burning incense and practicing the Dao, chanting sacred hymns, lighting lamps and releasing living beings, performing the *Step-in-Emptiness* rituals, making offerings and vows, submitting petitions of repentance, and holding grand fasts and jiao rites, reverently beseeching Heaven and Earth day and night without ceasing—then I shall dispatch the Ten Perfected Celestials, the divine immortals of the heavens, the officials of the Three Realms and Four Bureaus, and the youthful spirits of salvation to descend into the human realm, all gathering at the ritual site to eradicate their sins and protect the living. Thus, the land will be at peace, men and women will rejoice in prosperity, all blessings will descend, and no evils will arise. The suffering souls of hell will all be liberated at once, ascending to the joy of Heaven, and the realm will enjoy effortless great peace. Their merit will be towering, and their blessings boundless.\"\n\nThe Primordial Supreme Lord again addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side, saying: \"I see that in the boundless worlds of the Ten Directions, the Heavenly Kings of the Ten Directions construct thirty-two-tiered celestial terraces and treasure platters, all adorned with purple gold, pearls, jades, brocades, and grains, with purple nets and treasure canopies, purple-tasseled banners and streamers, a hundred kinds of flowers and foods, vessels of a hundred treasures, and celestial music filling the void, all coming to the ritual site in array for offerings.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy, through his divine power, transformed the land of this assembly into lapis lazuli, translucent within and without, all of one color, equal in near and far. The Three Realms and Ten Directions all partook of blessings and joy beyond words. The Nine Dark Hells ceased their trials, the Five Sufferings halted their bitterness, the land was at peace, and the people enjoyed long life.\"\n\nThe Primordial Supreme Lord again addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side, saying: \"If in the lower realm there are faithful men and women who invite Daoist masters and Dharma teachers to regularly proclaim the scriptures and precepts on the Three Origin festival days, expounding the karmic conditions of sin and blessing, repenting their own impurities—the foul and filthy Four Great Elements, the fragile and transient union of the body, the impermanence of every thought, the Three Actions and Six Roots constructing all evils, gradually staining and forming transgressions, cycling through birth and death, falling into the Three Wretched Realms, the Nine Dark Hells, enduring all manner of torments—swallowing fire and eating coals, boiled in cauldrons, treading upon knife mountains, grasping at sword trees, ground in mills, pounded in mortars, sawed apart, drilled and chiseled, having their eyes pecked by iron birds, their tongues plowed by iron plows, beaten by ox-headed demons, their bodies burdened with iron staves, their pus and blood flowing, their bodies rotting away, sinking into darkness, revolving in the muddy hells, carrying stones to fill rivers, tortured day and night. Once entering the Fengdu Hell, they endure ten thousand kalpas without reprieve—all self-inflicted by the karmic power of sentient beings.\n\nIf there are faithful men and women who awaken to goodness, constructing Jade Capital high seats and Purple Tenuity celestial terraces for the sake of their seven generations of ancestors, their living parents and kin, the Five Sufferings and Three Wretched Realms, the destitute souls, hungry ghosts, animals, prisoners, the elderly and sick, hanging banners and offering flowers, presenting a hundred treasures, performing jiao rites to the stars, submitting petitions, bowing in repentance, burning incense to extinguish the roots of sin—all will be transcended.\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side, saying: \"If on the Three Origin festival days, faithful men and women hold fasts and jiao rites for all humans and devas, reciting scriptures, bowing in repentance, making offerings to the Heavenly Worthies, immortals, stellar deities, and the hundred bureaus of the earthly prison, and for the sake of their ancestors and parents, awaken even a single good thought with unwavering sincerity—then their past, present, and future parents of three generations will gain boundless blessings and have all their sins extinguished.\"\n\nThe Primordial Supreme Lord addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side, saying: \"I see that the people of the lower realm suffer many calamities and harm from evil spirits. For the sake of their deceased ancestors, parents, and honored kin, on the Five La Days—when Heaven and Earth grant amnesty—it is fitting to hold fasts, practice the Dao, bow in repentance, and submit petitions to rescue and transcend their ancestors, gaining boundless blessings.\n\nOn the first day of the first month, the Heavenly La Day, the Five Emperor Immortals gather in the Azure Heaven’s Peaceful Treasure Flower Grove at the Azure Spirit Palace to examine the registers of the world’s sins and blessings. On the fifth day of the fifth month, the Earthly La Day, the Five Emperor Immortals gather in the Cinnabar Heaven’s Brahma Treasure Prosperous Yang at the Vermilion Spirit Palace to examine the registers of the world’s sins and blessings. On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Daoist La Day, the Five Emperor Immortals gather in the Golden Gate’s Plain Spirit Palace to examine the registers of the world’s sins and blessings. On the first day of the tenth month, the People’s Year La Day, the Five Emperor Immortals gather in the Dark Heaven’s Cavern Yin at the Black Spirit Palace to examine the registers of the world’s sins and blessings.\"\n\nOn the La Day that falls in the twelfth month—the La Day of Kings and Lords—the Five Emperors of the Five Directions gather in the Primordial Spirit’s Wu-Ji Golden Gate within the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis, in the Eight Radiance Hall of the Primordial Supreme Lord, to examine the registers of the world’s sins and blessings. These five La Days are the days when Heaven and Earth converge, when the ledgers of fortune, misfortune, life, and death are fixed.\n\nIf there are men and women who, for their past ancestors and parents, perform rites of repentance, submit petitions, and offer thanks for transgressions, they may erase names from the Black Register of sins and ascend to deliver their seven generations of ancestors, inscribing their names in the Upper Clarity. All shall thus attain deliverance.\n\nThese five La Days concern the nine generations of ancestors and parents of the living, as well as the ghostly souls in the Dark Mountain. On these days, the Great Emperor of the Northern Darkness of Fengdu summons them forth for interrogation, questioning those long confined in the nether courts, whose sins have accumulated over the ages, whose offenses and origins are bound to the names of their descendants and the locations of their graves. If, after kalpas of time, no redemption has been sought, the living shall be implicated on this day, their names and those of their kin and nine clans recorded as the living’s offenses, their transgressions bound to the dark courts, their nine clans doomed to annihilation.\n\nOn this day, one may submit petitions and perform rites of repentance for deceased ancestors and parents, redeeming them from the dark paths, so that each of the departed may attain deliverance. Daily sacrifices must not be neglected, for the depths of Fengdu are profound and difficult to penetrate; only by relying on true principles may one resolve past transgressions, release the souls from the dark courts, and prevent prolonged confinement. If the dead remain long confined, the Heavenly Offices shall hold the officials of the dark courts accountable, and the living shall also be held responsible. Blessings shall turn to misfortune, and calamities shall arise therefrom.\n\nIf there are filial sons and daughters who, on this day, observe fasts and offer jiao rites, their names shall be stricken from the Black Register, and they shall gain boundless blessings, all attaining deliverance.\n\nThe Primordial Supreme Lord addressed the attendant perfected ones at His side: \"The beings of the lower realms possess varying perceptions; their habits of evil and good, their roots and foundations, differ. I now speak these essential words, and all should believe and uphold them.\n\nIf beings engage in killing, harm, and injury, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Compassion.\nIf they steal, rob, or seize wealth, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Righteous Sharing.\nIf they indulge in licentiousness and debauchery, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Chastity.\nIf they are greedy, miserly, and stingy, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Almsgiving.\nIf they are wrathful and contentious, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Joy.\nIf they are foolish and deluded, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Expedient Means.\nIf they engage in frivolous and flowery speech, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Simplicity and Rectitude.\nIf they lie and deceive, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Faithfulness and Compliance.\nIf they curse and revile, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Recitation and Invocation.\nIf they slander and malign, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Praise and Admiration.\nIf they overindulge in wine and meat, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Fasting and Abstinence.\nIf they slander and defame, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Exposition and Teaching.\nIf they are arrogant and disdainful, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Reverence and Worship.\nIf they are stubborn and overbearing, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Gentleness and Humility.\nIf they disbelieve in the consequences of sins, blessings, and past lives, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Causes and Conditions.\nIf they cling to existence and nonexistence, they shall be gathered through the Gate of the Middle Way.\nIf they engage in disputes of right and wrong, self and other, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Equality.\nIf they are greedy, filthy, and defiled, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Purity.\nIf they are obstinate and unyielding, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Cyclic Transformation.\nIf they ceaselessly create and act, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Non-Action.\nIf they are rigid and unchanging, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Rounded Adaptation.\nIf they are restless and competitive, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Stillness and Concentration.\nIf they are afflicted and unable to let go, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Liberation.\nIf they are sorrowful and joyless, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Carefree Wandering.\n\nThrough these twenty-four gates, all shall be constantly gathered. Would not all beings find joy in this?\"\n\nThe Primordial Supreme Lord said: \"I originally gathered through non-gathering, exhorting and transforming all beings. Once beings awaken, there is also no cause for gathering. If one can uphold and observe these teachings, boundless blessings shall be attained.\"\n\nThe Primordial Supreme Lord again addressed the attendant perfected ones at His side: \"If among the multitudes of the lower realms there are faithful and devout followers of the Dao who, for the sake of their nine generations of ancestors and distant parents in the dark realms, establish the Three Clarities’ sacred thrones and light the Seven Luminaries’ bright lamps—whether in ancient temples and numinous altars or in purified chambers within their own homes—burn incense, perform the Dao, chant the Cavernous Chapters, recite scriptures and repent, and offer grand jiao rites to the myriad heavens with unwavering sincerity, I shall dispatch the Most High Sovereign of Salvation, the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion, to open the Seven-Treasure Cloud Tower in the Nine Qi Heavenly Palace, revealing the Golden Script of the Azure Tablets and proclaiming the august names of the Heavenly Worthies. Descending to the human realm, they shall enable all in heaven and earth to perform rites of reverence and invocation, erasing the records from the Jade Caskets of the Nine Dark Realms’ eternal night, so that the seven generations of ancestors may attain deliverance, their souls ascending to the Southern Palace, where immortals shall receive and guide them to carefree non-action, gaining boundless blessings.\n\nTherefore, burn incense, surrender body and life, prostrate with the five limbs touching the earth, and with sincere devotion, pay homage to:\n\nThe Jade Clarity Sacred Realm’s Void and

thousand states and nine provinces for all humans and devas to recite and intone. If there are faithful men and women, those who attain the Dao, who on the Eight Festivals, the Three Primes, or their birthdays and life-destiny days, recite and perform repentance rituals, offering sacrifices to Heaven and Earth for the Three Armies and all the people, for all sentient beings—burning incense and giving thanks—this will cause their households to flourish, their generations to prosper, their descendants to be wise, their lifespans and blessings to be prolonged, and their merit and virtue to tower magnificently, forever dispelling worldly calamities.\"\n\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Eastern Sea’s Vast Virtue.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Southern Sea’s Vast Saint and Great Beneficence.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Western Sea’s Vast Moisture.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Northern Sea’s Vast Blessing.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Jiang’s Vast Source.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the River’s Numinous Source.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Huai’s Long Source.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Ji’s Clear Source.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Zhejiang Water Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Wujiang Water Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Chujiang Water Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Jingjiang Water Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Yangzi River Water Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Xiangjiang Water Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Songjiang Water Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Nanjiang Water Palace.\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the divine dragon officials and their retinues of the Hanjiang Water Palace.\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Highest Origin again addressed the attendant Perfected Ones at his side, saying: \"I now send down this scripture, scattering it throughout the ten directions of the world, so that all humans and devas may reverently recite it, gaining blessings in every life, eradicating sins in every generation, fulfilling all that they seek, and accomplishing all that they desire. If there are those in the world who uphold the Dao, faithful households, who on their life-destiny birthdays, the Eight Festivals, or the Three Primes, burn incense and recite, establishing grand fasts and offering sacrifices, chanting the precious titles of the Three Clarities and the names of the Perfected Ones—may their highest prayers ascend: for the Three Dukes and their assisting ministers, for generals and officials, to present memorials and petitions, welcoming auspiciousness and gathering blessings, forever attaining wealth and nobility, and long preserving distant longevity.\"\n\nThe Master of Subtle Wonder burned incense and gave thanks to the Golden Portal’s Lord of Heaven, offering this hymn of praise:\nHeaven-born wisdom comes to aid the flourishing age,\nWith ice-like jade’s sharpness and phoenix-bird’s grace.\nHarmonizing the primal transformations, striving to aid concord,\nFarmers sing in green fields, weapons rest from the four frontiers.\nMay the Five Blessings long gather, the celestial fortune forever abide.\n\n*Thus concludes the fourth scroll of The Supreme Lingbao Repentance for Facing Heaven and Atoning for Sins.*\n*The Supreme Lingbao Repentance for Facing Heaven and Atoning for Sins, Scroll the Fifth*\n\nAt that time, the Golden Portal’s Great Sage, the Primordial Lord of the Highest Origin, was seated upon his precious cloud-jade throne in the wondrous realm of the Nine Clarities, the Heavenly Palace of Five Clouds. He convened a great assembly of immortals, expounding the wondrous Dharma of True Unity to broadly deliver all beings, causing them all to attain transcendence and awakening.\n\nAt that moment, the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, together with all the Heavenly Great Sages, the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct, the Supreme Perfected of the Nine Heavens, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, and all the divine immortals—each riding five-colored jade wheels, eight-scene jade chariots, flying cloud canopies, ten-fold spirit banners, dragon standards, and phoenix plumes—burned incense and scattered flowers, traversing the void and pacing the heavens, chanting cavernous hymns. They circled the jeweled terrace of kalpas’ height, all together praising and singing to the Primordial Lord of the Highest Origin, rejoicing in celebration.\n\nAt that time, the August One, with great majesty and virtue, emitted the seven-jeweled divine radiance, illuminating the vast heavens and reaching down to the boundless worlds, the Nine Dark Realms’ long-night hells. The karmic retributions of good and evil were all made manifest.\n\nThen, the Heavenly Lords of the Nine Qi of the East, with their attendant Perfected and numinous officials, ascended to the Golden Portal.\nThen, the Heavenly Lords of the Three Qi of the South, with their attendant Perfected and numinous officials, ascended to the Golden Portal.\nThen, the Heavenly Lords of the Seven Qi of the West, with their attendant Perfected and numinous officials, ascended to the Golden Portal.\nThen, the Heavenly Lords of the Five Qi of the North, with their attendant Perfected and numinous officials, ascended to the Golden Portal.\nThen, the Heavenly Lord of the One Qi of the Center, with his attendant Perfected and numinous officials, ascended to the Golden Portal.\n\nThey arrayed themselves in ranks, burned incense, and presented the registers of the world’s multitudes—of life and death, sin and blessing.\n\nIn an instant, the myriad-transforming palaces and terraces were all adorned with carved water crystal, lapis lazuli, coral, and amber, with qilin and lions guarding left and right. Each proceeded to their jeweled seats to expound the registers of life and death from the Fengdu hells.\n\nSuddenly, the wailing cries of the dead souls in hell, undergoing interrogation and punishment, resounded in agony. Again, one saw the forsaken dead souls, unclaimed in the gloom, unrecorded by the ghostly officials.\n\nThen the Five Thearchs above inquired: \"What karmic retribution has this multitude of sinners committed to endure such unbearable torment? We beseech the Heavenly Compassion to grant them deliverance.\"\n\nThe Primordial Thearch addressed the Thearch Lords, saying: \"The dead souls of the Lower Kalpa endure this interrogation. For in former lives, they were disloyal and unfilial, their lord-subject bonds devoid of righteousness, their father-son ties lacking kindness. They disrespected the Three Luminaries, disbelieved in sin and blessing, deceived their masters and slandered the Dao, rebelled against their kin, wantonly slaughtered living beings, and indulged in greed and lust. The Life Mandate Officers stripped them of their allotted years, leaving their lifespans uncertain. Now, their dead souls face karmic reckoning, their kalpas exhausted with no release.\n\nThese souls, in former lives, were addicted to wine and meat, slaughtering without restraint. They performed no good deeds, devoted themselves solely to unrighteousness. Though their allotted years were not yet spent, the ghostly gods of the Six Heavens’ Cavernous Palaces seized upon their transgressions, unleashing plagues and pestilence. They met untimely deaths—by water, fire, bandits, epidemics, blades, or warfare—enduring hardships in public and private, entangled in disputes, shackled by slander, thwarted in all endeavors. For years and months uncounted, they suffered misfortune without respite.\n\nAgain, one saw the Wind-and-Thunder Hell, where black gales and crashing thunderbolts, jagged lightning and flying spears, assailed the sinners, tearing their limbs asunder, piercing their five viscera. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Fire-Glare Hell, where sinners swallowed flames and devoured coals, scorched by fire. Their faces and heads were charred, fire-mountains crowned their skulls, flames sprouting from their skin, flesh, and bones. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Diamond Hell, where sinners were beaten without number by iron hammers and metal rods. Their limbs rotted, their sinews and bones scattered. Iron forks pierced their bellies, metal hammers stuffed their hearts. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Dark-and-Cold Hell, where sinners were submerged in freezing ice, their sinews and bones severed by frost-edged blades. Cauldrons of venomous brew were poured upon them, their bodies disintegrating, their hearts and bellies ruptured. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Copper-Pillar Hell, where sinners embraced and climbed copper pillars engulfed in raging flames. Their outer and inner flesh charred and festered, their backs and bellies oozed pus. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Butchery Hell, where sinners were hung upside down, their bodies carved by blades. Their four limbs, sinews, skin, and five viscera were all sliced by knives. Blood flowed across the ground, their suffering beyond endurance. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Fire-Chariot Hell, where sinners were torn asunder by five chariots, their limbs scattered. Some were bound to fire-chariots, dragged east and west, north and south. Each wheel bristled with blades, slicing the sinners as the wheels turned, while raging fires roasted them to charred ruin. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Cauldron Hell, where sinners were impaled by iron forks and plunged into boiling cauldrons. Their bodies were stewed and dissolved, their limbs rotted, their pus and blood reeking, their suffering beyond endurance. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nThen, the Primordial Thearch, the Ten Directions’ Savior-from-Suffering Heavenly Worthy, and the Deliverance Perfected Ones radiated their great majestic light, employing the six supernatural powers to command the sinful souls to close their eyes and silently reflect, recalling the days of their past lives and the evil deeds they had committed. Some had murdered their lords or fathers, been unfilial to their parents; some had slandered true immortals; some had harmed their brothers; some had plotted against their masters; some had committed incest with kin; some had robbed and killed; some had butchered the orphaned and poor, bullying the weak with strength; some had abused their power to oppress the vulnerable; some had defiled sacred texts; some had harbored secret malice and envy; some had wielded vicious tongues and sowed discord; some had incited strife among the good. For kalpas uncounted, they had accumulated these sins, now suddenly recalled in full. Each soul saw clearly, their sorrow and remorse redoubled. They longed for liberation, all beseeching deliverance.\n\nThe Primordial Thearch again addressed the attendant Perfected, saying: \"I see these sinners, for kalpas unending, have disbelieved in scriptures and repentance, devoted themselves solely to transgression. Thus, their names are inscribed in the ledgers of evil, their bodies consigned to the Nine Dark Realms, their souls trapped in the Three Wretched Paths, with no means of escape.\n\nIf there are faithful men and women who, for the sake of their deceased ancestors, parents, and kin, establish fasts, perform the Dao, prostrate in prayer, and present petitions; who aid the orphaned and poor, release living beings to extend life—then I shall dispatch the Great One Savior-from-Suffering Heavenly Worthy from the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace. There, he shall open the Three Heavenly Mystic Treasuries, the Sevenfold Jeweled Scriptures, the Jade Tablets and Coral Cases, and reveal the Heavenly Worthy’s august names. Descending to the mortal realm, he shall praise and chant, reciting the Cavernous Chapters, dissolving their sins, erasing their names from the eternal night of the Nine Dark Realms. The Jade Casket’s cases shall be distributed, enabling all sinful souls to escape suffering, attain liberation, and follow their wishes to be reborn, carefree and unconstrained, all achieving transcendence.\n\nTherefore, burn incense, surrender body and life, prostrate with the five limbs touching the earth.

Their ranks shall be exalted, their lifespans prolonged, and their blessings boundless.\"\n\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Earth-Lung Mountain Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Covering Bamboo Mountain Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Clear Distant Mountain Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Peaceful Mountain Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Stone Knoll Mountain Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Eastern Immortal Source Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Azure Isle Mountain Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Luxuriant Grove Cavern Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Cinnabar Water Mountain Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Cinnabar Cloud Cavern Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Lord Mountain Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Scorched Source Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Numinous Vault Mountain Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Fertile Continent Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Heavenly Mother Peak Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Yoye Stream Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Golden Court Mountain Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Horse Ridge Mountain Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Goose-Sheep Mountain Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Cavernous True Mound Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Luminous Heaven Altar Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Cavernous Palace Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Pure Jade Altar Blessed Realm;\nWith sincere devotion, we bow to the Immortal Officials and Sacred Multitudes of the Pottery Master Mountain Blessed Realm.\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the attendant Perfected at his side: \"I now dispatch the Perfected of Great Splendor to bear this scripture, dispersing it throughout the ten thousand states and nine provinces, that all beings in the human and celestial realms may recite and invoke it, prolonging life and gathering blessings, preserving destiny and dissolving calamities. If there be those who revere the Dao—encountering the Three Primes, Eight Nodes, or their life-destiny birthdays—who perform purification rites and prostrations, reciting the precious titles of the Three Clarities and the names of the Heavenly Worthies, then may the three armies, myriad households, all under heaven, and every living being who burns incense and makes offerings be guarded by the host of sages. They shall eternally attain longevity and emolument, augment boundless blessings, and dissolve boundless transgressions.\"\n\nThe Master of Subtle Wonder prostrated in gratitude before the Golden Portal of the Celestial Emperor and offered this hymn of praise:\nResplendent are the empty and cavernous chapters,\nWhose numinous tones shake the Nine Heavens.\nThe Most Real unfolds the treasure’s store,\nTransmitting the scripture of the Profound and Inaudible.\nNow, once more, we encounter the precious gāthā,\nWhose sacred text delivers our ancestors.\nSalvation is granted to souls of the long night,\nAscending to the Vermilion Numinous Heaven.\nWith reverent hearts, we honor what is venerated,\nProstrating in gratitude before the August Void.\n\nThus concludes the fifth scroll of *The Most High Numinous Treasure Repentance for Facing Heaven and Atoning for Sins*.\nThe sixth scroll of *The Most High Numinous Treasure Repentance for Facing Heaven and Atoning for Sins* begins.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Lord of the Highest was within the Yellow Gold Palace of the Great Canopy Heaven, amidst curtains of the seven treasures. His majestic power manifested in full, his auspicious radiance blazing, illuminating heaven and earth. The Perfected and immortals of his retinue, an innumerable host, raised standards and bore incense, arrayed to his left and right, pacing in celestial circuits and extolling the Most High.\n\nThen the Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, and Water Immortals, each arrayed in solemn dignity, ascended to the Golden Portal to present the records of the living and dead, the merits and transgressions of the myriad peoples of the ten thousand states and nine provinces—every name and deed, without the slightest omission.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Lord of the Highest addressed the attendant Perfected at his side: \"I observe that all sentient beings are but empty illusions, their thoughts perishing in an instant, never pausing for even a moment. Bound to the wheel of suffering and rebirth, the common folk remain unaware, shuttling through the Three Paths, enduring ten thousand kalpas of bitterness. Receiving form after form, they are ensnared by afflictions, all arising from deluded thoughts, inverted views, and attachments to life, death, existence, and annihilation. Unable to liberate themselves, they are most pitiable.\"\n\nAt that moment, within the Dharma assembly, the Perfected of Golden Splendor and the Perfected of Vast Blessings, bearing tablets and adorned with pendants, stepped forth from the ranks to burn incense and prostrate before the Golden Portal of the Celestial Emperor: \"We, having accumulated profound goodness, now dwell in the Jade Clarity and are privileged to attend at your side, reverently hearing the Dharma’s teachings and receiving instruction for all beings. Yet we now see that those below—heedless of past lives, disobedient to scriptures and precepts—contend over right and wrong, their six senses clouded, their hearts ensnared by the Five Poisons.\"\n\nWhen they commit transgressions, they know no fear. Some invoke ghosts and spirits, seeking their aid; others point to the Three Luminaries and their seven generations of ancestors, swearing false oaths. They turn kin against kin, inflicting harm and slaughter without principle. As their lives draw to an end, they cling to their homes, wealth, and treasures, cherishing their own bodies and gazing back with longing at wives and daughters, their hearts gripped by desperate attachment. Or they utter wicked vows, and their creditors and enemies appear before them. Sinking into the Five Paths, they find no escape.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Heavenly Compassion to open wide its mercy, deliver all beings, and lead them out of the dark realms, that all may awaken to the Dao.\n\nThen the Most High Lord of the Primordial Dao addressed the attendant Perfected Ones: \"I observe that the beings below, lost in deluded thoughts and inverted views, all arise from the heart. They forcibly create distinctions, their minds struck by fleeting impulses, and upon encountering circumstances, they fall into confusion. Every thought they conceive is false. They must steady their resolve and contemplate their bodies with wisdom—bone, flesh, skin, limbs, hair, the six roots, the four great elements, the five viscera, and the hundred spirits. When they carefully reflect and ponder, they find no true substance. All is but a temporary aggregation, a confluence of illusory forms. Searching within and without, where is the self to be found? Since the body is but an illusion, the heart becomes empty. Emptiness and illusion are not real; all is but deluded thought. Right and wrong, love and hatred, attachment to forms and sounds, scents, tastes, touches, and dharmas—jealousy, stinginess, greed, killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, deceitful speech, harsh words, all such deeds—vanish entirely. With inner and outer purity and emptiness, one awakens to the true Dao.\"\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Dao addressed the attendant Perfected Ones: \"When you contemplate the body with settled wisdom, you find no true substance. Those who cling to false views do so because their six roots and three karmic actions remain impure. The six roots are: the eye root, the ear root, the nose root, the tongue root, the body root, and the mind root. These six roots give rise to all karmic actions, just as grasses and trees produce flowers, leaves, seeds, and fruits. In turn, the six emotions, six thieves, and six desires generate all karmic actions. If one employs wisdom to reflect, the karmic actions of the six roots are all exhausted.\n\nThe three karmic actions are: bodily karma, mental karma, and verbal karma. Bodily karma includes killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; mental karma includes stinginess, greed, and anger; verbal karma includes deceitful speech, falsehoods, harsh words, and divisive speech. Together, these form the ten evils. When one carefully reflects, all ten evils are seen as insubstantial. By gradually eliminating the three karmic actions and the six roots, diminishing them again and again, and persisting in this practice over time, one naturally awakens to the true Dao.\"\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Dao addressed the Perfected Ones attending on either side: \"I pity the beings below, who for kalpas uncounted have set their minds and intentions upon falsehoods, lacking in sincerity and truth, indulging in deceitful speech. Some utter such speech before the sacred images of the Heavenly Worthies; others do so before the scriptures and Daoist altars; still others before their parents and revered elders, before the wise and the venerable, before the powerful and the noble, or before those of keen understanding. Even before the divine assemblies of the heavens, the sun, moon, and stars, their every thought is tainted with deceitful speech. Their sins are grave indeed. Today, before the sacred altar of the Three Treasures, they repent and seek forgiveness, praying that all may be cleansed.\n\nI pity these beings, whose bodies and minds give rise to deceitful speech, falsehoods, harsh words, divisive speech, jealousy toward those who surpass them, and the stirring of strife and contention. They sever the bonds of kinship, turn falsehood into truth, and transform deception into reality. Today, through repentance, may all be purified, and may they enter the root of faith.\"\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Dao addressed the Perfected Ones attending on either side: \"I observe that the beings below, from the moment they assume form, employ their eyes, ears, nose, and tongue to conceive evil—killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, dissipation, stinginess, greed, anger, delusion, inverted views, deceitful speech, falsehoods, harsh words, divisive speech, jealousy toward those who surpass them, consuming alcohol and meat, violating the Three Luminaries, turning from truth toward falsehood, believing in perverse and inverted views, sacrificing to ghosts and spirits, failing to honor the Three Treasures, slandering and reviling, arrogance and contempt, indulgence in sensual desires, attachment to scents and flavors, sinking into infatuation with touch and dharmas, creating evil within and without, each giving rise to the other. The six roots interact, compounding transgressions, their roots of sin growing ever deeper. With every thought, they commit wrongs, accumulating boundless sins over time, all lodged within their bodies, beyond reckoning.\n\nYet with a single thought of the heart, all may be purified. It is like a bright mirror covered in dust, its surface obscured by grease and grime, accumulating into cataracts that cloud its inner and outer radiance. But when it encounters a skilled craftsman who wipes, polishes, and cleanses it, its surface and depths become luminous once more, reflecting near and far as it did in the beginning. Why is this so? Because its nature is fundamentally pure. So too is the human condition: the spirit is inherently pure, free from all defilement. Yet after assuming form, one gradually becomes tainted by transgressions—the six roots, six emotions, six thieves, six desires, and the discriminations of the six consciousnesses—creating defilements and obscurations. The body becomes an obstacle, and one loses the true nature, drifting through the cycles of birth and death, ever falling into the roots of sin. Entangled in karmic retribution, one enters hell, suffering myriad torments, revolving through ten thousand kalpas.\n\nOut of compassion, I pity these beings and have, from kalpa to kalpa, turned the wheel in the human realm, appearing now among the barbarians, now among the Chinese, now old, now young, now noble, now base, employing every expedient means to teach and deliver them. The scriptural teachings have spread, awakening all beings, that they may escape suffering and forever depart from the hells. Yet beings are dull-witted and fail to comprehend. Therefore, I now distinguish for you the causes and conditions of sin and merit, that all beings may attain liberation.\"\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Dao addressed the assembly of Perfected Ones: \"If there are faithful men and women below who receive and uphold this scripture, burn incense, and repent, washing away all the sufferings within their bodies, they shall attain purity and dissolve the boundless, measureless roots of past evil karma.\"\n\nThe celestial sages and all divine immortals ever desire that people diligently burn incense and repent, for then ten heavenly benevolent deities shall protect them, and all sages shall safeguard their persons. If the roots of sin bind the body, entwining it within and without, then malevolent spirits shall afflict and harm them, sickness shall cling to their bodies, and they shall suffer water, fire, blades, weapons, venomous creatures, fierce beasts, fetters, imprisonment, and manifold torments. Foolish mortals know only to adorn their faces, garments, hands, and feet outwardly, yet cannot inwardly cleanse their bodies and minds of the roots of sin and evil karma—how utterly deluded! If one diligently washes and purifies the face, hands, feet, and garments, one shall surely attain purity, encounter divine immortals, and obtain blessings and felicity.\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Dao addressed the Perfected Ones at His side: \"If below there are devout men and women who uphold the Dao, and within ancient temples or sacred altars, or in the purity of their own chambers, establish the precious thrones of the Three Clarities and the sacred altars of the Five Emperors for their departed ancestors, recite scriptures, perform repentance rites, and hold grand jiao offerings to all heavens, I shall dispatch the Most High Lord of Salvation from Suffering of the Great Monad to open the Purple Tenuity’s treasure vault and the cinnabar texts of the jade tablets, reveal the august names of the Heavenly Worthies, extol and proclaim them, and chant the cave scriptures. They may then beseech the erasure of their names from the Nine Dark Realms’ jade caskets, universally liberating humans and celestials from suffering, dissolving kalpas of sin, and acquiring boundless merit.\n\nTherefore, burn incense, surrender body and life, and prostrate with the five limbs touching the earth.

By virtue of these meritorious deeds, they shall be delivered from the Five Sufferings and liberated from the Three Wretched Realms. Above, they shall ascend to the Vermilion Mound Palace; below, they shall enter the Gate of Illuminating Radiance.

Above, it shall dispel heavenly disasters; below, it shall avert poisonous harms. The blessings thus accrued shall be boundless. If there are those of accumulated goodness who encounter the Three Primes, Eight Festivals, or their own birthdays and death anniversaries, and on behalf of deceased ancestors and the hidden souls of their parents, seek to dedicate merit to the netherworld, burning incense and reciting the precious titles of the Three Clarities and the names of the Great Perfected, may the departed souls of their former lives, their living parents, and all the people be blessed in every rebirth, soon encounter immortals, attain the Five Fortunes, and eternally enjoy the natural state.\"\n\nMaster Chongmiao prostrated before the Golden Portal of the Celestial Emperor and offered this hymn of praise:\n\n\"The Jade Emperor proclaims the celestial decree,\nUniversally releasing souls from the dark of night.\nThe Eight Difficulties all dissolve,\nThe Five Paths all open wide.\nFengdu’s retributions cease,\nAnd they ascend to the Crimson Palace on high.\nAll beings awaken to the supreme Dao,\nForever enjoying boundless fortune.\"\n\n*Thus concludes Scroll Six of the Supreme Lingbao Repentance for Atonement Before Heaven*\n\n*Scroll Seven of the Supreme Lingbao Repentance for Atonement Before Heaven begins*\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Venerable was in the Jade Clarity Palace within the Great Canopy Heaven, seated upon the Five-Cloud Celestial Treasure Wondrous Terrace. He gathered the celestial immortals, terrestrial immortals, aquatic immortals, the numinous perfected of the Three Realms, and an immeasurable host. All proceeded to the Celestial Pass, ascending to the Jade Clarity, burning incense and scattering flowers, pacing the void in circumambulation, and prostrating before the Most August.\n\nThen, the Celestial Venerable radiated his majestic light and broadly expounded the wondrous Dharma, vowing to deliver all beings and enable their awakening to the Dao.\n\nAt that moment, the Perfected of Supreme Clarity, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, and the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct stepped forward, burned incense, and prostrated before the Most August, saying: \"Since time immemorial, we have been graced to dwell among the ranks of the perfected and honorably attend the jeweled portals. Each time we hear the numinous sounds, we awaken the dust-bound multitudes. We constantly contemplate the myriad people below, adrift in the sea of desire, tossed upon the waves of love, ceaselessly revolving through birth and death. We know not what meritorious deeds might enable them to escape this sinking abyss and attain complete deliverance.\"\n\nThen, the Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the attendant perfected at his side, saying: \"If there are faithful men and women in the world below who perpetually engage in acts of benefit, restraining their mouths and mortifying their bodies, bestowing alms of wealth and treasure, and constantly cultivating fields of merit—extending aid to birds, beasts, and all creatures possessing consciousness, universally relieving hunger and cold—this is foremost among all deeds.\n\n\"If they dig wells by the roadside, construct dwellings, plant orchards and groves, and succor the weary and suffering; or if they build bridges across rivers to ferry travelers, diligently and tirelessly performing such acts—then the host of sages will guard their bodies, and they shall accrue boundless merit.\"\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the attendant perfected at his side, saying: \"I pity the multitude of beings entangled in the Three Poisons and Ten Evils, beset by demonic sprites, malevolent ghosts, evil spirits, venomous insects, fierce beasts, weapons of war, fire and flood, fetters and prisons, illness and suffering, calamities and misfortunes, unable to find peace.\n\n\"For this reason, I expound for you the great Dharma of the Three Caverns, the talismanic scriptures and precious sutras, to save and protect the world and grant it peace and happiness. Yet beings, deluded and ignorant, fail to recognize sin and merit, indulging their six senses. Some kill living beings, steal, engage in licentiousness and debauchery, hoard with greed, seethe with anger, wallow in ignorance and delusion, utter deceitful and frivolous speech, slander with malicious words, and devour the flesh of living creatures. They defy heaven and earth, forsake the true and follow the perverse, sacrifice to ghosts and spirits, committing a multitude of sins without a single good deed. Thus, poisonous winds and malevolent qi, the demonic ghosts of the Six Heavens, pervade the human realm, perpetuating slaughter day and night without cease. I grieve deeply for them.\n\n\"I constantly dispatch the Celestial Emperor Kings, the Ten Ultimate Immortals, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors to inspect and deliver them, enabling all to awaken and transcend, avoiding the multitude of evils, and dissolving their long-standing transgressions.\"\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable again addressed the celestial immortals at his side, saying: \"I observe that since time without beginning, ordinary beings have sunk into the suffering of sin, creating manifold evil karma—killing living beings, stealing, engaging in licentiousness and debauchery, hoarding with greed, seething with anger, wallowing in ignorance and delusion, slandering with malicious words, uttering deceitful and frivolous speech, devouring the flesh of creatures, destroying lives, defying heaven and earth, disbelieving in sin and merit. The weight of their karmic deeds is immeasurable.\n\n\"They may establish the precious thrones of the Three Clarities and the stellar altars of the Five Emperors in the sacred halls of temples or within the pure chambers of their own homes. Burning incense and scattering flowers, they may prostrate before heaven and earth, repent and present memorials, beseeching the dissolution of their transgressions. Thus, their bodies and dwellings shall be purified, and all calamities shall be entirely eradicated, accruing boundless merit.\n\n\"If emperors, kings, empresses, imperial consorts, princes, or celestial descendants arouse the supreme aspiration and invite Daoist masters and ritual masters to establish a ritual arena in the main palace hall or a pure Daoist chamber for the sake of their seven generations of ancestors, seven generations of lineage, deceased parents, and all kin—reciting scriptures, performing repentance rituals, burning incense and lighting lamps, repenting and practicing the Dao, bestowing alms of wealth, clothing, and bedding, releasing living beings to extend their lives, and broadly conducting fasts and offerings with unwavering devotion—then I shall dispatch the Ten Celestial Perfected, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, and the Ten Upright Numinous Officials to descend and observe.\n\n\"If their minds and bodies remain steadfast, the sick shall recover, the dead shall revive, the imperiled shall be delivered, the imprisoned shall be freed, travelers shall return, and officials shall be promoted. Water, fire, weapons of war, tigers, wolves, venomous beasts, evil spirits, and demonic sprites—all calamities and difficulties—shall never afflict their bodies. Their years shall be long, and each shall attain peace and tranquility.\n\n\"If, for the sake of deceased ancestors, they aspire to liberate them from the Nine Dark Hells, the Knife Mountains, the Sword Trees, the Cauldrons of Boiling Oil, and the torments of whips and cudgels, enabling them to ascend to the celestial halls, roam freely in non-action, and awaken to the supreme Dao—\n\n\"If, for emperors, empresses, princes, the people, the land, and all beings, they recite scriptures and perform repentance rituals to save and protect all, they shall enjoy peace in this life and accrue boundless merit.\n\n\"If weapons of war arise on all sides, harming the myriad people, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rituals shall cause them to retreat and disperse without inflicting harm.\n\n\"If epidemics spread and the people lie stricken with illness, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rituals shall bring immediate recovery and peace to the multitude.\n\n\"If floods and droughts disrupt the balance, harming the five grains, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rituals shall bring timely wind and rain, and the hundred grains shall flourish.\n\n\"If malevolent winds and poisonous qi, scorching fires, and conflagrations consume dwellings, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rituals shall harmonize the celestial qi, and all things shall be pure and moist.\n\n\"If evil ghosts, venomous insects, and fierce beasts harm people, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rituals shall cause them all to retreat and flee.\"\n\nIf women are with child and struggle in labor, unable to deliver, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rituals shall bring safety to both mother and child, sparing them from peril and distress.\n\nIf palaces, halls, or dwellings are troubled by spectral demons, malevolent spirits, or disturbed qi, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rituals shall restore tranquility, banishing all fear forever.\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao addressed the perfected attendants at his side, saying: \"The merit of repentance rituals is beyond comprehension. It safeguards nations and households, harmonizes Heaven and stabilizes Earth, dissolves celestial disasters above, and averts poisonous harm below. Its blessings are beyond measure, universally delivering gods and humans.\"\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao spoke again to the perfected attendants: \"For the sake of all beings, I have broadly established fields of merit, greatly constructing virtuous deeds—copying scriptures, creating images, founding temples to deliver people, reciting scriptures, performing repentance rituals, holding purification fasts, and practicing almsgiving. The karmic rewards are towering and truly profound.\n\nWhy is this so? Wealth is the lifeblood of beings, deeply cherished and hard to relinquish. Yet those who can surrender their lives and possessions without stinginess, widely establishing merit and aiding the destitute and impoverished, inwardly stilling greed and outwardly eliminating bandits and thieves, shall profit both humans and gods, and in life and death receive grace. The merit of such salvation brings boundless blessings, and even the seven generations of ancestral spirits shall all be delivered.\"\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao addressed the perfected attendants at his side, saying: \"I and the host of immortals gaze down upon all beings, whose lives are like mayflies—born at dawn, dead by dusk—truly pitiable and sorrowful.\n\nWhen a person dies, the cycles of the Five Agents are exhausted, their qi severed and spirit departed, marrow drained and bones withered, their form desolate. Their heart trembles in fear, their spirit quakes in dread. At the moment of parting from life, they endure great suffering. Their inner and outer kin surround them, sons and daughters weeping in grief, the departing soul terrified, not knowing where it will go. As the body grows cold and hollow, and the last breath fades, the evil deeds and transgressions of their lifetime appear before them.\n\nIf one has accumulated goodness in past lives, heavenly beings shall support and protect them, and their soul shall ascend to realms of bliss. If one has accumulated transgressions in life, ox-headed demons and rakshasas shall drive them into hell, where they shall endure every torment.\n\nAt such a time, the mighty and noble, the proud and wealthy, all vanish in an instant. Fine carriages and grand steeds—what concern are they now? Estates, gold, and treasures all belong to others. Wives, children, and kin—can they take one’s place? All karmic adversaries stand before them, like shadows following form, inescapable.\n\nYet if faithful men and women make grand vows, offering great sacrifices to Heaven and Earth on behalf of deceased parents and all ancestral kin, submitting memorials and petitions, reciting true scriptures—it shall be as darkness finding light, as illness finding medicine, as poverty finding treasure, as hunger finding food, as a prisoner finding release, as drought finding rain. Their sins shall be washed away, and all shall be purified, ascending to halls of blessing, escaping the Five Sufferings, and attaining eternal deliverance.\"\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao spoke again to the perfected attendants at his side: \"In the ten directions of the world below, if devout and faithful men and women of the Dao, on behalf of suffering souls in hell or sin-laden evil ghosts, establish the precious altars of the Three Clarities and the sacred altars of the Five Emperors, burn incense and light lamps, offer rare delicacies and exotic fruits, submit memorials and petitions, and hold grand sacrifices to the hosts of heaven—for all creatures, whether the six livestock or flocks of fur and feather, donkeys, mules, oxen, or horses burdened by heavy karmic sins—I shall dispatch the Most High Lord of Salvation, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Unity, to open the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace and the precious caskets of jade registers. The august names of the Heavenly Worthies shall be proclaimed, and all people below shall be transmitted and delivered. Extolling and praising, chanting the cavernous scriptures, contemplating the divine and invoking the perfected, they shall beseech the erasure of sins from the Nine Dark Realms and the karmic burdens of the six livestock. Thus shall they be delivered to the heavens of humanity, freed from suffering, and attain boundless blessings, all achieving deliverance.\n\nTherefore, burn incense, surrender body and life, prostrate with the five limbs to the earth.

ten thousand states and nine provinces, to all the countless multitudes. Let them reverently recite and make offerings. If those who have accumulated goodness encounter the Three Origins of their destined life, or the Five Vegetarian Feasts, they may burn incense, recite the scripture, and hold grand jiao rites for Heaven and Earth. On behalf of the hidden souls of past generations, their parents who gave them life, and all their ancestral kin, they may redeem them from the nether darkness, liberate them from suffering and affliction, and enable them all to attain deliverance. Thus transformed, they may be reborn as humans, met by immortals who guide them to ascend to the heavenly palaces, where they shall obtain boundless blessings.\"\n\nWith sincere devotion, pay homage to the Dragon Palace Officials and Attendants of the Yellow River Earl’s Watery Abode.\n\nWith sincere devotion, pay homage to the Dragon Palace Officials and Attendants of the Luo River Earl’s Watery Abode,\nto the Dragon Palace Officials and Attendants of the Huai River Earl’s Watery Abode,\nto the Divine Immortals and Sacred Hosts of Wu Gorge Stream,\nto the Divine Immortals and Sacred Hosts of Five Clouds Stream,\nto the Divine Immortals and Sacred Hosts of Min Mountain Stream,\nto the Divine Immortals and Sacred Hosts of Clear Distant Stream,\nto the Divine Immortals and Sacred Hosts of Tong□ Stream,\nto the Divine Immortals and Sacred Hosts of Mount Bo Stream,\nto the Divine Immortals and Sacred Hosts of Kunlun Stream,\nto the Divine Immortals and Sacred Hosts of Wu Ling Stream,\nto the Divine Immortals and Sacred Hosts of Zhu Luo Stream,\nto the Divine Immortals and Sacred Hosts of Di Stream,\nto the Divine Immortals and Sacred Hosts of Huan Sha Stream,\nto the Divine Immortals and Sacred Hosts of Mian Chi Stream,\nto the Dragon Palace Officials and Attendants of the Upper Watery Abode of Mount Ma Dang,\nto the Dragon Palace Officials and Attendants of the Central Watery Abode of Mount Cai Shi,\nto the Dragon Palace Officials and Attendants of the Lower Watery Abode of Gold Mountain.\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable again addressed the attendant perfected ones, saying: \"I now dispatch the Perfected One of Golden Florescence to descend with this scripture, dispersing it throughout the ten thousand states and nine provinces, that all in the human and heavenly realms may chant and recite it. On behalf of their present parents, deceased ancestors, and all sentient beings, they may perform reverent rites to dissolve karmic misfortunes of old. Those who devoutly make offerings shall see their households flourish, their generations prosper, myriad disasters averted, and divine spirits guard their gates.\n\nIf there are Dao-following folk or faithful men and women in the world who, upon encountering the Three Origins, Five Vegetarian Feasts, or their destined birthdays, perform purification rites and chant the precious titles of the Three Clarities and the golden scripture of the jade scroll, they may redeem all the sinful ghosts and offenders in the Fengdu hells, wishing them liberation and deliverance, ascending to the Vermilion Palace, and rebirth into the human realm.\"\n\nThe Master of Subtle Wonder burned incense, paid homage, and offered thanks to the Golden Portal Celestial Venerable, presenting this hymn of praise:\n\nThe Primordial Venerable of Jade Capital,\nLord of creation and myriad transformations,\nReveals the numinous scripture to the Three Officials,\nOpening the nine dark prisons below.\nIn Fengdu’s cauldrons of blazing hells,\nCompassion showers the Dharma rain,\nWashing clean the souls of all sins,\nThat all may attain deliverance.\n\n*End of the Seventh Scroll of the Most High Numinous Treasure Repentance for Heavenly Homage and Atonement of Sins*\n*Beginning of the Eighth Scroll of the Most High Numinous Treasure Repentance for Heavenly Homage and Atonement of Sins*\n\nAt that time, in the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Primordial Celestial Venerable, the Great Sage of the Golden Portal, was in the Jade Clarity Sacred Realm’s Primordial Yang Treasure Palace, seated upon the Five Clouds Heavenly Treasure Wondrous Terrace, expounding the sublime Dharma to the celestial great sages. Suddenly, the gates of heaven trembled violently, and the Primordial Celestial Venerable, with his divine radiance, illuminated below. There appeared a dense, black, noxious, blood-red qi rising to assail the heavenly gates, coiling and lingering without dispersal. This qi reeked of blood and filth, startling the assembled host.\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the celestial great sages and perfected ones at his side: \"Below, in the vast and boundless Dark Sea of the great wilderness, whose depths are unfathomable, stands a great mountain piercing the azure vault above and descending into the windy springs below, named the Northern Yin Fengdu Mount Luo. It is the master of yin qi and the pivot of the nine earths. Beneath it lies a great cavern called the Palace of the Yin Realm, wherein resides the Supreme Yin Water Emperor. Within the Northern Yin Celestial Lord are myriad officials of the netherworld, and the mountain holds three palaces, nine bureaus, and thirty-six great iron hells. The grasses and trees of this mountain naturally emit toxic qi, transforming all into blades and swords. Their edges flash through the air, black smoke billows, and malevolent winds howl ceaselessly day and night—all places where the netherworld officials torture and punish sinful ghosts and the dead.\n\nWithin are six palaces of great demonic evil spirits who, seeing sentient beings lost in darkness and delusion, descend in formations to the human realm, wantonly creating monstrous calamities, harming the living, and entangling the souls of the seven generations of deceased ancestors. They bring forth all manner of disasters, malignant illnesses, plagues, and toxic qi, causing indiscriminate death and untimely harm—so pitiable that one cannot bear to hear of it.\n\nThen the attendant perfected ones, arrayed in ranks, burned incense and memorialized, prostrating themselves and beseeching the Most Venerable to open the power of great compassion and wisdom, to save and deliver all beings, that both the living and the dead may receive grace and escape the suffering of sin. They implored: 'May all sinners be spared the three calamities of the present world, the nine misfortunes, the five pestilences, the seven afflictions, the myriad diseases, the toxic qi, and the perils of demonic spirits and ghosts. May their lives be free from harm.'\"\n\nShould you deign to show compassion, then lift your gaze and receive the sacred words.\n\nThereupon the Most Venerable addressed the attendant perfected ones, saying: \"I pity all beings as a mother cherishes her child. Now, for your sake, I shall expound these wondrous words—heed them well, and hold them fast in your hearts.\"\n\nThe attendant perfected ones and all divine immortals bowed their heads to the ground, listening to the sacred decree of the Primordial Sovereign of the Dao.\n\nIn ancient times, the people were simple and guileless, free from malice, following the natural course of their fate. They fulfilled their allotted years without untimely harm. But in this degenerate age, human hearts have grown shallow and corrupt, rupturing the five emotions. Discord and deception prevail, deceit and delusion intertwine. They no longer speak of true cultivation but indulge in perverse conduct, forsaking the real for the false, abandoning the Dao and virtue. They defy heaven and earth, usurp ministers and overthrow rulers, disloyal and unfilial, devoid of love and compassion. They deceive and mislead the common folk, oppress and tyrannize the people, wrongfully kill living beings, and cruelly harm all life. They forge countless karmic enmities, inviting manifold calamities.\n\nSome engage in robbery and plunder, committing murder and injury. Others fall prey to malevolent demons that destroy their bodies. Some suffer the bites of venomous snakes, tigers, wolves, or poisonous insects. Others face official disasters, slanderous tongues, or unjust imprisonment—beaten, bound, exiled, or sentenced to penal servitude. Some households are struck by plagues, their bodies afflicted by toxic qi, their kin ravaged by illness and death, their families torn asunder. Some are struck down by celestial thunder, others consumed by heavenly fire. All such transgressions arise from the weight of accumulated karma.\n\nThe qi of slaughter from the Six Heavens and the legions of ghosts from the Northern Feng, together with the deities of the Five Peaks and the ghostly marshals of the slain, roam the world, seizing upon the faults of sinners to unleash their toxic qi. They slaughter the wicked, who in turn prey upon one another, leading to death, the ruin of households, and the extinction of descendants. Witnessing this, I am deeply grieved—so pitiable that one cannot bear to hear of it.\n\nYet if there are those in the world who uphold the Dao, who awaken the supreme mind, who generously bestow wealth to relieve the destitute, who release living beings to extend their lives, who recite scriptures and repent with unwavering devotion—then above, they will dispel calamities, and below, they will avert myriad disasters.\n\nShould a land be plagued by unending warfare and pestilence, if its people sincerely recite this repentance and observe pure fasts, then the scourge of war will cease, malevolent forces will withdraw, heaven and humanity will rejoice, and the nation will know peace.\n\nIf one finds themselves in the wilderness, pursued by tigers or wolves, let them sincerely invoke this scripture and vow to recite it—then protective deities will come to their aid, and the beasts will retreat, causing no harm.\n\nIf one ventures upon the sea and encounters fierce winds, let them vow to recite this scripture—then the waves will calm, and they will reach the shore.\n\nIf one is caught amidst the blades of battle, let them vow to recite this scripture—then weapons will vanish, and no harm will come.\n\nIf one is imprisoned in shackles, let them vow to recite this scripture—then their wrongs will be redressed, and they will surely be freed.\n\nIf one is tormented by malevolent spirits or demonic entities, let them vow to recite this scripture—then the spirits will vanish, daring not to cause harm.\n\nWhen the day of one’s death arrives and their soul enters the Nine Dark Hells, if their family—sons, daughters, husbands, or wives—establishes a Nine Darks fast and ritual, offering reverence to the Three Palaces, then the soul will transcend the Five Sufferings and be reborn according to its merit.\n\nUpon hearing this scripture, the sinners in the Nine Dark Hells will awaken in body and mind, all arousing the intention for the Dao, never to retreat. Thereupon, heaven will respond by sending a decree to release the imprisoned souls, and all will be delivered.\n\nIn that moment, the Black Registers of the Nine Darks will be consumed in flames, the flames of Fire Mountains will subside, the waves of Ice Pools will still, and those who once swallowed fire and ate coals will taste sweet dew. The golden hammers and iron rods will transform into lotus blossoms. Divine immortals will lift them up to ascend to the Southern Palace, where all will be reborn.\n\nThrough the great power of the Primordial Sovereign of the Dao and the boundless compassion of the Most Venerable, all beings will be saved, their bodies and minds purified, liberated from the Fengdu Hell, and reborn according to their wishes.\n\nThen the Savior from Suffering Perfected One is commanded to open the Terrace of Yang, to unfurl the Jade Chest of Purple Scripts, and to proclaim the august name of the Heavenly Worthy.\n\nYou should establish the Three Clarities’ sacred thrones and the Five Emperors’ numinous altars, hang banners and offer flowers, array rare delicacies and exotic fruits, present solemn offerings, recite scriptures and repentances, submit memorials and petitions, and perform rituals to give thanks to the stellar hosts of the heavens, the Five Emperors, and the Three Officials. Burn incense and light lamps, chant the cavernous hymns, and beseech the erasure of the Nine Darks’ Jade Casket of Everlasting Night from the Registers of Luminous Perfection—so that all imprisoned souls may escape suffering, their boundless sins dissolved, and boundless blessings attained, to rely upon in life and death.\n\nThus, with incense burning, we surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves in full devotion.

disseminating it throughout the ten thousand states and nine provinces, that all in the human and celestial realms may transmit, copy, recite, and venerate it. For the sake of departed ancestors, they shall dedicate merit to the underworld, guiding souls to the Southern Palace, that all may return to the human path and attain longevity. If there be Dao-following folk or faithful men and women in the world who, upon encountering the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, or their life’s fateful days, perform rites for their seven generations of ancestors, parents, and kin—reciting the precious names of the Three Clarities and the titles of the Celestial Perfected, or submitting memorials for departed ancestors and living relatives, releasing life to extend destiny, and broadly cultivating fields of merit—then shall their disparate bones become kin, the nation be at peace, the people prosper, and all rejoice in great harmony. Through veneration and worship, all shall attain deliverance.\"\n\nMaster Chongmiao, burning incense and bowing to the Golden Portal of the Celestial Venerable, offered this hymn of praise:\n\"With devoted heart, we bow to the Supreme Ultimate,\nAs the Jade Emperor bestows vast grace.\nHeavenly decrees proclaim to the earthly prisons,\nOpening deliverance for the long-night souls.\nThe dark realms release the seven generations,\nDivine talismans announce to the Three Officials.\nImmortals together receive and guide,\nAscending to the Vermilion Mound Heaven.\nForever freed from the roots of sin,\nEternally enjoying blessings by nature.\"\n\n*Thus concludes the Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Pervasive Treasure Repentance for Atonement Before Heaven.*\n\n*The Ninth Scroll of the Supreme Pervasive Treasure Repentance for Atonement Before Heaven*\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Venerable was seated upon a seven-jeweled wondrous terrace within the Jade Capital’s Golden Portal in the Supreme Great Luo Heaven. Together with the Most High Jade Dawn Dao Lord and the Most High Sagely Ancestor Lord Lao, he assembled all the gods and immortals of the heavens to expound the wondrous Dharma, broadly delivering celestial and human beings, that all might attain the Dao and forever awaken to non-action. Then, among the Dharma assembly, the Jade Clarity Perfected and the Supreme Ultimate Perfected, along with the gods and immortals of all heavens, holding talismans and bearing tablets, burned incense and scattered flowers, pacing in celestial circles, extolling the sagely virtue. Never before had such been heard or seen. They stepped forth from the ranks to bow and addressed the Most Honored One: \"We, your servants, humbly attend your cloud-borne chariot, having received the appointment to the ranks of the Perfected.\"\n\nWe observe that all sentient beings below are benighted in body and mind, unaware of the wondrous transformations of the Numinous Treasure’s spontaneous efficacy—how then may they be saved and delivered? Many suffer the six premature deaths and five injuries, the hundred spirits and nine grotesqueries; malevolent ghosts roam widely, pestilential poisons and myriad diseases arise, giving rise to calamities and misfortunes. Creditors and adversaries, slanderous tongues, and ceaseless wailing fill the air; human hearts are stricken with sorrow and dread. Cold and heat arise within, illness manifests without. They pray to unorthodox spirits, offer blood sacrifices in pursuit of blessings, and recklessly prognosticate fortune and misfortune, entangling themselves in a hundred monstrosities. Thus they incur guilt before the Three Officials, and the Ten Directing Spirits, the Deities of Destiny, and the Recorders inscribe their transgressions, submitting them to the Celestial Treasury. Their allotted years and blessings are stripped away, their lifespans shortened by the stroke of fate. They die by their own hands or are born into suffering, with no means of liberation.\n\nAt times, the Five Bushel Star Officials report omens of change: disasters, floods, droughts, unseasonable winds and rains, the fourfold rise of warfare, pestilence, and death. The sovereign is filled with anxiety, the common people plunged into misery, with no means of deliverance. We humbly beseech the Celestial Compassion of the Most High to safeguard the nation’s destiny, deliver the multitudes of the people, and radiantly proclaim the transformative power of the Dao, that all sentient beings may awaken to and comprehend the Orthodox and True, and all attain transcendence.\n\nThen the Most High Primordial Lord addressed the Perfected attendants at his side: “Since the beginningless kalpas, I have constantly dwelt among humankind, teaching and delivering sentient beings, that the ten directions, the Three Realms, and all beings—mundane and sacred, celestial and human—might universally attain liberation, abide in serene constancy, and neither arise nor perish. By upholding the precepts, reciting the scriptures, and broadly establishing fields of merit, one may deliver and liberate sentient beings. All the sages revere this, all demons bow in submission, and their names are inscribed in the Upper Clarity.”\n\n“I pity sentient beings for their benightedness in body and mind, unable to hear the teachings. Now, for your sake, I proclaim the Ten Supreme Precepts, which generate blessings for humans and devas, create good karma in life and death, bestow blessings, and dispel calamities—yielding boundless recompense.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected attendants: “The first precept: the multitudes of the lower realms must not kill, nor harbor the thought of killing, nor kill deliberately or out of greed. They must constantly practice compassion, delivering all sentient beings, and regard all beings as themselves.\n\nThe second precept: they must not steal, nor harbor the thought of theft. They must constantly practice yielding and decline ill-gotten gains, regarding all wealth and treasures as their own.\n\nThe third precept: they must not engage in licentiousness, nor harbor lustful thoughts. They must constantly practice purity, dwelling in seclusion amidst the scenery, and regard all men and women as their own flesh and blood.\n\nThe fourth precept: they must not be covetous or greedy, nor harbor greedy thoughts. They must constantly practice generosity, broadly aiding the poor, maintaining equanimity of mind, and making no distinction between self and others.\n\nThe fifth precept: they must not give way to anger, nor harbor angry thoughts. They must constantly practice joy, reconciling enemies and kin, and regard all sentient beings as their own children.\n\nThe sixth precept: they must not be deluded, nor harbor deluded thoughts. They must constantly practice wisdom, guiding the ignorant and confused, and regard all sentient beings as their own hands and feet.\n\nThe seventh precept: they must not engage in frivolous speech, nor harbor frivolous thoughts. They must constantly practice integrity, maintaining inner and outer harmony, and regard the scriptures and precepts with constant recitation.\n\nThe eighth precept: they must not speak falsely, nor harbor false thoughts. They must constantly practice sincerity, concealing nothing and deceiving none, and regard all people without false imaginings.\n\nThe ninth precept: they must not engage in harsh speech, cursing, or any form of verbal abuse. They must constantly maintain right mindfulness, never giving rise to malicious intent, and regard venomous serpents as self-generating their own poison.\n\nThe tenth precept: they must not sow discord among relatives and friends with divisive speech. They must constantly practice uprightness, never fostering partiality, and regard all beings without notions of favor or aversion.”\n\nThe Most High Primordial Lord addressed the Perfected attendants at his side: “These precepts I proclaim are the city walls and dwelling houses of sentient beings. Men and women who uphold them will constantly have Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, Vajra Warriors, and the Ten Celestial Benevolent Spirits attending and guarding them at their sides. They will dispel calamities, transcend adversities, preserve life, and prolong existence. Immortals will revere them, deities will guard their gates. Swords and weapons, water and fire, tigers and wolves, venomous serpents, illnesses, imprisonment, demonic thieves, malevolent spirits, hunger, cold, suffering, and all disasters and misfortunes will not afflict them. Those who seek sons will have sons; those who seek daughters will have daughters. Wealth, honor, longevity, and joy will follow their hearts’ desires. They will possess wisdom and intelligence, their forms and appearances will be upright and proper, and their merit and virtue will be towering and inconceivable.\n\nIf good-hearted men and women perform repentance rites, practice the Dao, uphold the precepts, and cultivate goodness, it will be like a precious sword cutting through all obstacles, like a Dharma boat ferrying all across, like a raging fire burning all away, like pure water washing all clean. From the Three Clarities downward to the perfected immortals of the ten directions, none fail to uphold these scriptures and precepts. The precepts serve to prevent wrongdoing and halt evil, to discipline body and mind, subdue external demons, and move the numinous immortals—yielding boundless blessings.”\n\nThe Most High Primordial Lord addressed the Perfected attendants at his side: “I observe that the sentient beings of the lower realms, since the beginningless kalpas, have taken human form only to indulge in stinginess, greed, and sensual desires, drinking wine and eating meat without restraint. They nourish their flesh and blood, fostering pus and filth, thereby generating illness and affliction, deepening the roots of sin, and enduring the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death. Heat, dampness, wind, and cold assail them; pain, itching, aches, and soreness afflict them. Malignant winds and toxic qi enter their bodies, infecting their forms with a hundred diseases. Moment by moment, impermanence prevails; day and night, they weep in sorrow.\n\nTheir births and endowments of consciousness differ, yet day and night they cycle through myriad births and deaths. Some dwell in the womb, congealing into pus and blood, only to dissolve and vanish. Others remain in the mother’s belly, unable to be born; if born, they perish at once. Though briefly separated from their mothers, they die immediately—beyond count. Some live one or two years, others a hundred, yet in every moment they change, their essence and qi waning. Headaches and fevers, a thousand afflictions assail them. In their entire lives, they know little peace. This is truly due to their gluttonous consumption of filth, filling their bodies, the fumes of wine and meat steaming their organs, malignant winds and toxic qi fanning their frames, minerals and metals dissolving their forms—so that their bodies do not endure.”\n\nI drink not, nor eat, abiding in the Dao by nature,\ntransforming without bound, living long without death.\nEver do I expound the scriptures and precepts,\nopening the path to deliver all beings—\nyet the common folk, deluded and foolish, cannot believe or accept.\n\nI am ever filled with sorrow and compassion for this,\nand so I set forth the rites of fasting,\nthat they may extinguish sickness and suffering.\nI also reflect upon all beings:\nsince the beginningless kalpas of time,\nthrough the two states of existence and perishing,\nall their kin and kindred,\nevery transgression they have committed in this world—\nthe gods of the Five Paths,\nthe roaming messengers,\nthe Deities of Fate and Record,\nthe awe-inspiring spirits who inspect and record their offenses—\nall these submit their reports to the heavens,\nentangling them across lifetimes,\nleaving no escape.\nEvery evil they have endured,\nwhen may they hope to return?\n\nToday, with the five limbs prostrate upon the earth,\nburning incense and making repentance,\nthey beseech the erasure of the jade tablets of the Nine Dark Realms,\nthat all in heaven and earth may be freed from suffering,\ntheir boundless sins dissolved,\ntheir boundless blessings attained.\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao once more addressed the perfected attendants at his side:\n“If in the world below there are those who uphold the Dao,\nwho for the aquatic beings—dragons, turtles, fish, and clams,\nthe shelled and scaled creatures of the waters—\nerect altars, perform repentance rites, recite scriptures,\nburn incense, and light lamps,\nrepenting and cleansing the watery palaces and damp abodes of these creatures,\nand beseech the grace of heaven to deliver them,\nthat all may shed their scales and shells,\nreturn to the human path,\nand have every transgression absolved—\nthen I command the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion and Salvation\nto open the Palace of Radiant Yang,\nto bring forth the jade tablets and golden registers bearing the august names of the Heavenly Worthies,\nto extol and praise them,\nto chant the sacred verses,\nto present petitions for redemption,\nthat all aquatic beings—fish and dragons—\nmay be freed from suffering,\ntheir boundless sins dissolved,\nand boundless blessings born.\n\nThus do we burn incense,\ndevoting body and life,\nprostrating with the five limbs upon the earth.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage.”\n\nIn the sacred realm of Jade Purity, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Void and

the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies and dispatch the Perfected of Salvation from Suffering to descend to the lower realms, that they may be recited and venerated throughout the myriad nations and the nine provinces, by all people. Above, this will dissolve celestial calamities; below, it will avert misfortune. If there are those of pure devotion—men and women who follow the Dao—who, upon encountering their natal day, the Three Primes, or the Five La, burn incense, chant, and offer libations in gratitude to the Heavenly Worthies, they shall attain flourishing fortune and blessings in life and death, be liberated from the five sufferings, have their souls released from the nine hells, be rescued by immortals, ascend to the celestial palaces, and have the gods and humans heed their vows, receiving the secret instructions in earnest.\"\n\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of the Cavernous Numinous Source, Blessed Land of the Immortal Palace.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of the Three Sovereigns’ Well, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of the Bramble Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Celery Stream, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Dragon-Tiger Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Numinous Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Spring Source, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Carefree Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Joined Tallow Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Beginning Abundance Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Golden Essence Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of White Source Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Bowl Pond Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Debate Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Master Mao’s Altar, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Chicken Coop Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Paulownia Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Mount Pingdu, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Green Gauze Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Manifest Vision Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Embracing Fortune Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Great Face Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Tiger Stream, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Primordial Alignment Mountain, Blessed Land.\nWith single-minded reverence, we bow in homage to the sacred assembly of immortals and officials of Horse Hoof Mountain, Blessed Land.\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable again addressed the attendant Perfected on his left and right, saying: \"I now dispatch the Perfected of Salvation from Suffering to descend to the human realm with this scripture, that it may be disseminated and venerated by all. If there are those who follow the Dao who, upon encountering the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, or their natal day, recite it for themselves, their souls shall be purified, their myriad qi shall endure, they shall be spared suffering, their bodies shall radiate light, and through chanting the cavernous chapters and reverently bowing to the sacred titles of the Three Clarities and the Ten Great Perfected, or if they perform rites for their deceased ancestors and all sinful souls, they shall be eternally delivered from the Three Paths, transformed into immortals, transcend the Three Realms, and ascend to the Vermilion Palace.\"\n\nThe Master of Subtle Wonder burned incense, bowed to the Golden Portal Celestial Venerable, and offered this hymn of praise:\nGreat Sage of the Golden Portal, Master of Heaven and Earth, Teacher of the Myriad Spirits.\nWith compassion, You shower sweet dew, washing away all dust and delusion.\nYou broadly expound the cavernous chapters, universally guiding all to awaken to the subtle and profound.\nYou rescue from the eight difficulties, lifting all from the mire of the five turbidities.\nYou deliver from the sea of six poisons, forever freeing them from greed, anger, and ignorance.\nImmortals join in guidance, carefree, ascending to the Great Subtlety.\n\nThus concludes the Ninth Scroll of the *Supreme Lingbao Repentance for Atonement Before Heaven*.\n\nThe Tenth Scroll of the *Supreme Lingbao Repentance for Atonement Before Heaven*\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Venerable was within the Golden Portal of the Great Luo Heaven, upon the jeweled terrace, gathering the multitude of immortals to broadly expound the wondrous Dharma for the deliverance of humanity. The celestial, terrestrial, and aquatic immortals of the Three Bureaus, the officials of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, and the hundred departments of the earthly prisons all arrayed their majestic regalia, adjusted their swords and sashes, mounted cloud-dragons, ascended to the celestial portal, lined up to burn incense, and stood in attendance beside the jasper pavilion, each presenting the registers of life and death, blessings and sins of the people from the four directions. Then, the Primordial Celestial Venerable manifested his great numinous power, widely casting auspicious light to illuminate the mountains, rivers, and lands of the myriad nations, revealing even the most minute karmic transgressions without exception.\n\nAt that time, the Golden Flower Perfected One, the Jade Purity Perfected One, the Wondrous Conduct Perfected One, and the Savior from Suffering Perfected One burned incense and prostrated before the Most Venerable, presenting a memorial that said: \"We now behold the multitudes of the lower realms, many of whom fail to believe and revere, indulging their bodies and minds, perpetuating cruel and poisonous deeds, slaughtering living beings, committing the three poisons of oral karma—so grave are their transgressions that the Ten Upright Deities, the Life-Recording and Register-Keeping Officials, record their crimes and submit them to the Celestial Treasury. Through kalpas unending, their sins entangle them, leaving no means of deliverance. Rewards and punishments, blessings and misfortunes are meted out with the precision of a hair’s breadth.\n\nWe see that those among the multitudes who accumulate goodness in life and perpetually practice hidden virtue are sheltered by the qi of Heaven, borne by the qi of Earth, illumined by the stars, revered by ghosts and spirits, followed by the Five Fortunes, and distanced from a thousand calamities. Yet those who accumulate transgressions and perpetrate cruel deeds in life are unsheltered by Heaven, unborne by Earth, unillumined by the stars, harmed by ghosts and spirits, distanced from the Five Fortunes, and followed by a thousand calamities. We observe this with profound sorrow and beseech the Celestial Compassion of the Most Venerable to broadly open the expedient means of salvation, universally delivering all beings to awakening and liberation from defilement.\"\n\nThen the Most Venerable addressed the great Perfected Ones, saying: \"I pity the myriad beings of the lower worlds as if they were my own children, desiring that all attain the Dao. Yet the sins of these beings run deep, and they dwell long in impurity, indulging their passions and desires, wallowing in defilement. In life, they perpetually indulge in lust. Some commit lewd acts within palaces, beneath the stars, or in sacred temples. Others do so in spirit shrines or at communal altars. Some seize and harm others, separating children from mothers, tearing lovers apart, severing bonds of affection, and cutting off tender care. Some engage in incest with kin, or unite with relatives. Others seduce slaves or servants, heedless of beauty or ugliness, wisdom or folly. Some oppress men and women, or sunder husbands and wives. Others defile the ordained, or bare themselves before Heaven and Earth, violating the four classes, indulging in every manner of lust, their minds filled with vile dreams, their couplings unrestrained. They give free rein to the six senses, their transgressions boundless, ensnaring body and mind, clouding the six consciousnesses, depleting their essence and qi, and amassing grave sins. Today, through repentance and purification, may all these transgressions be utterly eradicated.\"\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable again addressed the attendant Perfected Ones at his side, saying: \"I see that men and women of the lower realms, from the moment they conceive the intent to act, constantly engage in theft. Some steal sacred images of the Celestial Venerable, scriptures, Dharma treasures, or other property. Others steal from ordained Dharma masters, or from sacred temples and stellar altars. Some pilfer funds meant for the creation of revered images, or the estates and permanent assets of monasteries. Others take offerings meant for fasts and jiao rites, or the property of shrines and spirits. Some steal from their parents, children, or kin, or extort wealth through coercion. Others deceive through official matters, or forcibly seize property without just cause. Some employ deceit or false pretenses, or refuse to repay loans out of greed. Others exploit the ignorant, or bully and humiliate others to take their wealth. From the moment a single thought of theft arises, regardless of the amount, boundless sins accumulate unseen within, never brought to light. Today, as they burn incense and prostrate in repentance, may all their transgressions be washed away.\"\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable again addressed the attendant Perfected Ones at his side, saying: \"I observe the multitudes of the lower realms, amassing wealth like mountains, yet their hearts are never satisfied. Insatiable in greed, they scheme and contrive, toiling in body and mind, utterly devoid of benevolence. They live in the world with avaricious hearts, cutting and scraping. Some behold the Celestial Venerable or the stars and conceive miserly greed. Others see sacred temples or scriptures and do the same. Some encounter Daoist masters or Dharma teachers and grow stingy. Others see their parents or children and hoard their wealth. Some witness the poor, the orphaned, or the elderly and feel no pity. Others see the dying, the maimed, or the disabled and remain unmoved. Some observe prisoners in shackles or those in famine and feel no compassion. Others see travelers in distress, or those in water or fire emergencies, and turn away. Some exploit servants or laborers, yet refuse to give alms. They withhold offerings from the Celestial Venerable and stellar altars, from scriptures and registers, from fasts and jiao rites, from the copying of scriptures or the creation of images, from virtuous Dharma masters, from the poor and orphaned, from prisoners in shackles, from the sick and suffering, from those in water or fire emergencies, from travelers in dire need, or from those starving in famine.\n\nA person lives for a day, yet plans for a hundred years. Born with not a single coin, they depart with not a single coin. At death, all is emptiness. How foolish to cling to miserliness and greed, devoid of compassion! At the moment of death, their treasures, mansions, storehouses, estates, and lands all pass to others. Their wives and children weep, their kin scatter—what benefit remains? In life, they accumulate karma, each deed bearing its retribution, too dreadful to recount.\n\nI further see the multitudes of the lower realms, who daily amass sins, their hearts entangled in greed and malice, cutting and scraping from the orphaned and poor without a shred of pity. Some stand before sacred images of the Celestial Venerable and conceive anger. Others do so before temples and scriptures, or upon seeing ordained Daoists.\"\n\nSome grow enraged upon seeing scriptures copied or images crafted. Some grow enraged upon seeing fasting rites or Daoist altars. Some grow enraged upon seeing temple spirits or deities. Some grow enraged upon seeing the old, the sick, the orphaned, or the poor. Some grow enraged upon seeing prisoners in their cells. Some grow enraged upon seeing the dying in dire straits. Some grow enraged upon seeing floods, fires, or calamities. Some grow enraged upon seeing famine and starvation. Some grow enraged upon seeing slaves or laborers. Some grow enraged upon seeing the destitute begging. Some grow enraged upon seeing oxen, horses, or the six livestock. Such karmic impulses of the heart are measureless and boundless. In all their conduct and bearing, in every thought and intention, they lack all mercy and forbearance. Today, they prostrate themselves in repentance, beseeching the erasure of all these transgressions.\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao says: I observe the multitudes of the lower realms, who conduct themselves in the world with the six senses benighted, utterly devoid of even a shred of goodness. Some, before sacred images of the Celestial Venerable, act in utter folly. Some, before the stars and the Great Dao, act in utter folly. Some, before Daoist temples and sacred altars, act in utter folly. Some, in the midst of scripture recitations and Daoist rites, act in utter folly. Some, upon seeing ordained Daoists, act in utter folly. Some, upon seeing the sages of the empty sky, act in utter folly. Some, before their parents, wives, or children, act in utter folly. Some, before Heaven and Earth, the sun, the moon, and the stars, act in utter folly. Some curse Heaven and Earth, or revile and imprecate spirits and deities. Some rebel against their lords and fathers, or fail in filial piety to their ancestors. Some turn misfortune into disaster, establish laws that disrupt the natural order, commit incest with their kin, or murder others. They disbelieve in the karmic conditions of sin and blessing, in the retributions of past lives, claiming themselves eternal, neither born nor perishing, unable to distinguish good from evil, or the wise from the foolish. Such folly is unbearable to witness.\n\nAll the Perfected Ones now burn incense and prostrate themselves in homage before the Golden Portal of the Celestial Emperor, vowing that from this day forth, for all beings in the lower realms, the three karmic deeds of body, heart, and speech shall be released. May they ever attain purity of the six senses, forever free from contention, ever cultivating hearts of gentleness, harmony, compassion, and love, hearts free from heedlessness and arrogance, free from greed and miserliness. May they ever cultivate hearts of joy, hearts that refrain from killing and protect life, hearts of filial piety, loyalty, and trust, hearts that relieve the poor and rescue the distressed, hearts that benefit all beings with generosity. Those who cultivate such hearts shall be guarded by the ten celestial deities of goodness, their worldly misfortunes forever dispelled, their sins and calamities scattered and destroyed. They shall be forever free from fear, received by immortals, and all shall attain deliverance.\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao further addresses the Perfected Ones in attendance: From this day forth, if among the multitudes of the lower realms there are faithful followers of the Dao who, for all foolish beings burdened by sin and evil karma—including the winged and the crawling, the birds and beasts, and the six livestock—establish sacred altars, recite scriptures, perform repentance rites, light lamps, burn incense, prostrate themselves, and present memorials to the heavens, earnestly and without ceasing offering rites of thanksgiving to Heaven and Earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the Five Peaks, the Four Waterways, and the officials of Fengdu’s netherworld, then I shall dispatch the Most High Lord of Salvation from Suffering. From the Azure Repository within the Northern Numinous Purple Pavilion, he shall bring forth the Jade Tablets of Golden Script bearing the august names of the Celestial Venerable. Chanting and extolling the sacred hymns, contemplating the true and invoking the Dao, he shall beseech the erasure of their names from the Jade Archives of the Nine Dark Realms and the Bureaus of the Celestial Officials. Thus shall the Five Sufferings be absolved and the Three Wretched Paths released. The feathered and furred shall be freed from their sins, all attaining deliverance, returning to the human realm, no longer mired in suffering, forever dwelling in carefree ease, their wishes fulfilled.\n\nTherefore, burn incense, surrender body and life, prostrate yourselves with the five limbs touching the earth.

immortality.\n\nShould there be those who uphold the Dao—cultivating men and women—who, upon encountering the Three Origins, Five Winter Festivals, or their own birthdays, perform rites for the departed souls of former lives and the six relations of kin, offering repentance for the transgressions of past existences, or those whose bodies are trapped among the six kinds of livestock, the scaled tribes of water, the dragons and clams of aquatic realms, the scaly dwellers of damp abodes, or all manner of creeping creatures—pray that they may escape suffering and distress, return to the

For the departed souls of former lives and the six relations of kin, they shall perform rites of repentance and deliverance, that the hidden souls may receive salvation, be transformed by immortals, and become human. They shall ascend beyond the Three Realms, roaming freely in the Supreme Clarity.\n\nShould there be men or women in the world who, on the Three Origins and Eight Festivals, present memorials and petitions, reverently giving thanks to Heaven and Earth, observe pure fasts, and recite the precious names of the Three Clarities, then the perfected ones of the myriad heavens shall, for the hidden souls in hells, the six kinds of livestock, the scaled tribes of water, the dwellers of damp abodes, and all manner of creeping creatures, absolve their transgressions. For those who pray to wash away the calamities of past lives, may all be universally delivered from the gates of earth, forever departing the offices of ghosts, transformed into human form, and universally attain liberation.”\n\nMaster Chongmiao burned incense and gave thanks to the August Emperor of the Golden Portal, offering this hymn of praise:\nThe Jade Emperor bestows divine favor,\nHeaven proclaims to the ten thousand spirits.\nRescuing from the ninefold darkness of suffering,\nBroadly expounding the Three Caverns’ scriptures.\nNames recorded in the Southern Cinnabar Palace,\nSouls ascend beyond the Northern Frigid Court.\nForever departing the cauldrons of flame,\nStraightway emerging from the city of ice.\nImmortals together grant deliverance,\nRoaming freely in the Great Clarity.\n\nHere ends the Tenth Scroll of the *Great Repentance of the Lingbao for the Heavenly Seasons*.",

Assembling the multitude of immortals, they expounded the wondrous Dharma of True Unity, manifesting great majestic power and spreading vast auspicious radiance. Universally illuminating the boundless worlds, they revealed to all sentient beings the karmic conditions of good and evil, enabling them to know the retributions of past lives, the rewards of merit and sin, and the consequences of the Three Times.\n\nThereupon, the celestial great sages burned incense and prostrated in audience, arraying themselves in ranks to attend and listen to the Dharma-sound. The Primordial Celestial Venerable emitted nine-colored divine light, penetrating and illuminating all heavens below and the myriad lands. His majestic spirit transformed, pervading without obstruction, as clear as if held in the palm of the hand. The assembled immortals to his left and right, riding this majestic radiance, beheld the heavens and the karmic conditions of good and evil, both inner and outer, fully revealed.\n\nThey saw great sages and lofty perfected ones, their necks bearing circular aureoles, their forms adorned with wondrous marks—some riding upon light and traversing the void, soaring on dragons and driving cranes, treading clouds and pacing the emptiness, or journeying in simurgh-drawn chariots with phoenix canopies, roaming the Eight Extremes in carefree nonaction, their divine transformations self-mastered. Some beheld celestial and terrestrial immortals, golden lads and jade maidens, innumerable multitudes, blessed with happiness and joy. Some saw immortals bearing banners and holding tablets, burning incense and scattering flowers, multiplying their forms in transformation. Some saw flying celestial deva-kings and karmic youths, patrolling the human realm, recording good and evil to report to the heavens. Some saw the palaces of the sun and moon, the jeweled abodes of the stellar lodges, and the numinous officials of mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks, examining the people, assessing their good and evil deeds and merits, without the slightest error.\n\nThen, the Ten Flower Perfected Ones, together with the celestial great sages, burned incense and prostrated in audience, ascending to address the Most Venerable: \"Today, we have been granted the honor of attending this jeweled pavilion, beholding and hearing this wondrous assembly. Humbly standing at your side, we pray that you manifest your majestic power, erect a great Dharma-bridge, and guide all beings, that they may attain the Dao and forever transcend the delusions of the dust.\"\n\nThereupon, the Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side: \"You, the assembled immortals, follow my auspicious radiance and descend to observe the myriad lands and the earth, the mountains and rivers, and the multitudes of people, witnessing the retributions of good and evil. Those who establish meritorious deeds and broadly cultivate fields of blessing shall each receive the blessings of the heavens and humanity.\n\nThey saw emperors, empresses, generals, and ministers burning incense in the main halls, widely convening Dharma-assemblies, observing fasts and offering libations, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rites for the sake of all humans and devas to avert calamities and pray for blessings. They saw emperors, empresses, generals, and ministers humbling themselves before all beings, generously offering a hundred treasures to worship the heavens. They saw emperors, empresses, generals, and ministers establishing palaces and temples, sculpting sacred images, reciting scriptures and prostrating in worship to broadly seek blessings and benefits for all humans and devas. They saw emperors, empresses, generals, and ministers dispersing wealth and treasures to relieve the poor, the aged, the sick, and the destitute. They saw emperors, empresses, generals, and ministers constantly practicing compassion, refraining from killing or harming, avoiding extravagance and waste, and always practicing frugality.\n\nThey saw worthy Daoists constructing numinous temples and stellar altars, copying scriptures and crafting images. They saw worthy Daoists abstaining from grains and fasting, purifying body and mind, reciting and studying scriptures. They saw worthy Daoists releasing life to extend longevity, aiding and benefiting the impoverished. They saw worthy Daoists diligently striving toward the stellar Han to seek lightness and ascension. They saw worthy Daoists loyal to their lords and filial to their parents, compassionate and loving toward friends.\n\nThey saw emperors, kings, civil and military ministers hunting and killing, harming and injuring the common people. They saw emperors, kings, civil and military ministers imposing cruel and harsh punishments, oppressing the people. They saw emperors, kings, civil and military ministers indulging in lust and desire, unrestrained in the six senses, feasting and reveling without moderation. They saw emperors, kings, civil and military ministers destroying palaces and temples, burning and demolishing Dharma-halls. They saw emperors, kings, civil and military ministers disdaining monastics, humiliating Dharma-teachers, inflicting pain and punishment. They saw emperors, kings, civil and military ministers slighting Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, and the stellar lodges, poisoning and harming the virtuous. They saw men and women slandering the Dharma-body of monastics, engaging in licentious acts within temples, killing living creatures, and defiling sacred grounds. They saw men and women killing their parents, committing the five heinous acts of unfiliality, defying Heaven and betraying Earth, disbelieving in sin and merit. They saw men and women stealing the permanent possessions of the Three Treasures—offerings of wealth, flowers, fruits, banners, and canopies. They saw men and women betraying the Dao and rebelling against their teachers, violating vows and breaking oaths, deceiving others to settle debts. They saw men and women bound in willow locks and imprisoned, whipped, beaten, and tortured, their bodies maimed. They saw men and women with incomplete six senses, mute, deaf, or dumb, their hands and feet crippled and contracted. They saw men and women foolish, dull, and witless, afflicted with leprosy or madness. They saw men and women devoured or stung by venomous insects and fierce beasts. They saw men and women separated midway in life, not fulfilling their bonds with kin. They saw men and women torn from their mothers, sold into slavery. They saw men and women with bodies split open, rotting with maggots and festering with pus and blood.\n\nThey further saw hells where feet tread upon knife-mountains, limbs severed and bodies broken. They saw hells where hands grasp sword-trees, limbs and joints torn asunder. They saw hells where fire is swallowed and coals are eaten, smoke issuing from the entire body. They saw hells where pestles pound, mills grind, and bodies are reduced to dust. They saw hells where bodies embrace copper pillars, forms scorched and withered.\"",

They saw hells where saws split the form, blood streaming from the entire body. They saw hells where pressing rocks crush the frame, blood bursting from every pore. They saw hells where bodies sink in freezing ice, the entire form cracking and splitting. They saw hells where fire-mountains rest upon the head, face and body scorched and withered. They saw hells where iron birds peck out the eyes, skin and flesh torn asunder. They saw hells where tongues are pulled out, pierced by iron awls. They saw hells where dark waves are drawn and poured to flood the four rivers. They saw hells where stones are carried to fill rivers, laboring day and night without respite.\n\nThey further saw beings reborn as hungry ghosts. They saw beings reborn as the six kinds of livestock—oxen, sheep, swine, and dogs. They saw beings reborn among border tribes and lowly outcasts. They saw beings reborn with the six afflictions—deafness, blindness, muteness, dumbness, withered hands, and lame feet. They saw beings reborn as insects, beasts, flies, and gnats. They saw beings reborn as filth-dwelling worms in the mire. They saw beings reborn as noxious creatures—birds, beasts, fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs.\n\nAt that time, all the great sages and divine immortals in the Dharma assembly beheld such karmic retributions and causal conditions throughout the heavens and the earth, where sin and blessing differ. They knew not what cultivation in past lives had led to present transgressions, nor what blessings in past lives had brought present suffering. Some were seeds sown in former lives, calamity flowing to descendants; others were offenses accumulated in a single lifetime, bearing this karmic retribution. They prostrated and entreated the Heavenly Worthy in great compassion to bestow awakening, that all sentient beings might comprehend the causal conditions of past lives, the retribution of sin and blessing, the rewards and punishments of the heavens—every detail without deviation. If they aroused the mind to seek deliverance and followed the sacred words, all would attain liberation.\n\nThe Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy again addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side: \"If in the world below there are perfected persons and faithful disciples who arouse the unsurpassed Dao-mind, greatly bestow wealth and treasure to relieve the destitute, release creatures to extend their lives, erect wondrous seven-jeweled terraces, establish images of the Three Clarities, observe precepts and burn incense, and hold grand jiao rites to honor the hundred numina of heaven and earth, the stellar hosts of the celestial palaces, and offer a hundred precious offerings, I shall dispatch the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion and Salvation from Suffering to open the cinnabar-script purple texts in the Supreme Ultimate Palace, proclaim the august names of the Heavenly Worthies, extol and chant the cavernous hymns, and entreat the erasure of the souls languishing in the nine dark hells of eternal night, releasing the toils and entanglements of sin endured by their ancestors and parents through kalpas past. All shall be absolved and released, their souls ascending to the heavenly halls, where they shall wander carefree, their clothing and sustenance naturally provided. Their boundless blessings shall increase, their boundless sins shall dissolve. Their merit shall be towering, and all shall attain liberation.\"\n\nThus, in burning incense, they return their bodies and devote their lives, prostrating with the five limbs to the ground.

      "translated_text": "Those who indulge excessively in alcohol and favor pungent, foul, and filthy foods—such beings in this life suffer madness and are consumed by raging fire, and in past lives were reborn as apes and monkeys. They descend into hell, plunged into cauldrons of boiling liquid.\n\nMoreover, all beings who in this life have severed or crippled limbs, clenched and withered hands, or lame and crooked feet—such afflictions arise from disrespecting the Three Treasures and the stars. Those who are blind in both eyes or whose tongues fester and rot—such afflictions arise from slandering the scriptures and belittling the Three Treasures. Those who are mute and unable to speak, or whose noses are blocked and cannot smell—such afflictions arise from deceiving the ordained and disbelieving the scriptures and Daoist teachings. Those whose eyebrows fall out, lips curl back, tongues loll, or noses collapse—such afflictions arise from destroying sacred altars and slandering the Three Treasures. Those who are deranged, deluded, and grotesque in appearance—such afflictions arise from arrogance, contempt, and mockery of the ordained and the Dharma-body.\n\nThose who encounter bandits and have their possessions harmed—such misfortune arises from plundering the Three Treasures and the permanent endowments of the sacred. Those who drown in water or are harmed by fish and dragons—such misfortune arises from damaging the permanent endowments of the Three Treasures. Those who are burned and scorched by fire or devoured by venomous snakes—such misfortune arises from killing the ordained and demolishing monasteries. Those who have venomous creatures enter their mouths and vomit blood and filth—such afflictions arise from cursing with foul speech and invoking malevolent spirits. Those who have venomous creatures enter their orifices, are devoured by tigers and wolves, or are harmed by fierce beasts—such misfortune arises from secret schemes, poisonous malice, and deceitful hearts.\n\nThose whose parents, spouses, and children are separated, never living together, and constantly quarreling day and night—such misfortune arises from jealousy, adultery, breaking others’ harmony, and severing others’ flesh and blood. Those who engage in lewdness without regard for kinship, beauty, or ugliness—such beings arise from the realm of swine, dogs, and the six domestic animals. Those who crave meat, delight in killing, and indulge in alcohol to the point of madness—such beings arise from the realm of fish, turtles, frogs, venomous creatures, and fierce beasts. Those whose bodies are filthy, unclean, and foul-smelling—such beings arise from the realm of toads and venomous insects.\n\nThose reborn as oxen, horses, and the six domestic animals—such rebirths arise from killing living beings, evading taboos, and defaulting on debts. Those reborn as wild beasts, roebucks, deer, vipers, and pythons—such rebirths arise from jealousy, poisonous malice, and secret schemes. Those reborn as starving tigers and jackals—such rebirths arise from oppression, plunder, killing, and injury. Those reborn as filth-dwelling insects, toads, tadpoles, crickets, and ants—such rebirths arise from disdaining the Three Treasures and lacking reverence and faith. Those reborn as mad dogs, wild boars, fish, turtles, and monstrous creatures—such rebirths arise from turning against their teachers, abandoning their roots, and violating the scriptures and teachings.\n\nThose reborn as swallows, sparrows, and turtledoves—such rebirths arise from debating the scriptures and creating negative karma with their speech. Those reborn as hawks, falcons, and birds of prey—such rebirths arise from offending the ordained and destroying the scriptures and teachings. Those who miscarry or give birth to children with swollen bellies and thin necks—such afflictions arise from mocking the Three Treasures and arrogantly disparaging the ordained. Those who are imprisoned in shackles and subjected to torture and corporal punishment—such misfortune arises from flattery, poisonous partisanship, and cruelty toward the poor and lowly. Those who are whipped, beaten, and bound in shackles and prisons—such misfortune arises from malicious greed and cruelty.\n\nThose reborn as cats, dogs, wild dogs, jackals, wolves, foxes, and raccoon dogs—such rebirths arise from greed, stinginess, falsehood, and deceit. Those reborn with the bodies of rats, moles, centipedes, crickets, and lizards—such rebirths arise from secret malice and jealousy. Those reborn as bees, wasps, scorpions, venomous lizards, and geckos—such rebirths arise from cursing the ordained and disrespecting the Three Treasures. Those reborn as spiders, earthworms, mosquitoes, fleas, and lice—such rebirths arise from disdaining the Dharma, belittling the Dao, and mocking and slandering the scriptures. Those reborn as barbarians of lowly status, bald and with severed hair, deep-set eyes, long noses, and foul-smelling bodies—such rebirths arise from killing living beings, sexual misconduct, and disbelief in karmic causes and conditions.\n\nThe Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning addressed the attendant perfected beings at his side: \"The sins and karmic retributions described above condemn beings to hell, where they endure various tortures and punishments, suffering through kalpas before obtaining these forms. Some experience karmic retribution in this very life, the causes and conditions of their bodily afflictions clearly revealed. Each must purify their minds and repent, thereby gaining immeasurable blessings.\"\n\nThe Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning further addressed the attendant perfected beings: \"If in the lower realms there are faithful men and women of the Dao who, with utmost sincerity, establish altars for the Three Clarities and the Five Emperors’ stellar platforms on behalf of the empress, imperial consorts, the seven ancestral temples, and the noble lineages of past generations—hanging banners, offering flowers, rare and precious fruits, lighting incense and lamps, and performing grand jiao rites to the stars to redeem and liberate souls—then I shall dispatch the Heavenly Venerable of Great Compassion and Salvation, who will open the vermilion gates of the Scarlet Mound, inscribe the purple registers, proclaim the august names of the Celestial Venerables, chant and praise the cavernous scriptures, and release the stagnant souls of the Nine Dark Realms. Their past karmic obstructions will dissolve, the Five Paths will open, and they will attain carefree non-action, transcending to blessed rebirth. All their transgressions will be eradicated. Therefore, offer incense, surrender body and life, and prostrate with the five limbs touching the ground.\"",

He addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side, saying:\n\n\"Humans receive life from the same single qi; yet upon birth, their fate is bound to the Three Origins. Longevity or premature death, fortune or misfortune, wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness—all arise from karmic conditions of sin and blessing, good and evil, life and death. Each follows the root of their past existence, and all receive retribution according to their karmic power, never deviating, as the shadow follows the form, as the echo answers the sound.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first month of the Upper Origin, the celestial officials of the Heavenly Bureau ascend to the Heavenly Palace, presenting the registers of the world’s sins and blessings. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the Middle Origin, the terrestrial officials of the Earthly Bureau ascend to the Heavenly Palace, presenting the registers of the world’s sins and blessings.

Thus, the land will be at peace, men and women will rejoice in prosperity, all blessings will descend, and no evils will arise. The suffering souls of hell will all be liberated at once, ascending to the joy of Heaven, and the realm will enjoy effortless great peace. Their merit will be towering, and their blessings boundless.\"\n\nThe Primordial Supreme Lord again addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side, saying: \"I see that in the boundless worlds of the Ten Directions, the Heavenly Kings of the Ten Directions construct thirty-two-tiered celestial terraces and treasure platters, all adorned with purple gold, pearls, jades, brocades, and grains, with purple nets and treasure canopies, purple-tasseled banners and streamers, a hundred kinds of flowers and foods, vessels of a hundred treasures, and celestial music filling the void, all coming to the ritual site in array for offerings.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy, through his divine power, transformed the land of this assembly into lapis lazuli, translucent within and without, all of one color, equal in near and far. The Three Realms and Ten Directions all partook of blessings and joy beyond words. The Nine Dark Hells ceased their trials, the Five Sufferings halted their bitterness, the land was at peace, and the people enjoyed long life.\"\n\nThe Primordial Supreme Lord again addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side, saying: \"If in the lower realm there are faithful men and women who invite Daoist masters and Dharma teachers to regularly proclaim the scriptures and precepts on the Three Origin festival days, expounding the karmic conditions of sin and blessing, repenting their own impurities—the foul and filthy Four Great Elements, the fragile and transient union of the body, the impermanence of every thought, the Three Actions and Six Roots constructing all evils, gradually staining and forming transgressions, cycling through birth and death, falling into the Three Wretched Realms, the Nine Dark Hells, enduring all manner of torments—swallowing fire and eating coals, boiled in cauldrons, treading upon knife mountains, grasping at sword trees, ground in mills, pounded in mortars, sawed apart, drilled and chiseled, having their eyes pecked by iron birds, their tongues plowed by iron plows, beaten by ox-headed demons, their bodies burdened with iron staves, their pus and blood flowing, their bodies rotting away, sinking into darkness, revolving in the muddy hells, carrying stones to fill rivers, tortured day and night. Once entering the Fengdu Hell, they endure ten thousand kalpas without reprieve—all self-inflicted by the karmic power of sentient beings.\n\nIf there are faithful men and women who awaken to goodness, constructing Jade Capital high seats and Purple Tenuity celestial terraces for the sake of their seven generations of ancestors, their living parents and kin, the Five Sufferings and Three Wretched Realms, the destitute souls, hungry ghosts, animals, prisoners, the elderly and sick, hanging banners and offering flowers, presenting a hundred treasures, performing jiao rites to the stars, submitting petitions, bowing in repentance, burning incense to extinguish the roots of sin—all will be transcended.\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side, saying: \"If on the Three Origin festival days, faithful men and women hold fasts and jiao rites for all humans and devas, reciting scriptures, bowing in repentance, making offerings to the Heavenly Worthies, immortals, stellar deities, and the hundred bureaus of the earthly prison, and for the sake of their ancestors and parents, awaken even a single good thought with unwavering sincerity—then their past, present, and future parents of three generations will gain boundless blessings and have all their sins extinguished.\"\n\nThe Primordial Supreme Lord addressed the attendant perfected ones at his side, saying: \"I see that the people of the lower realm suffer many calamities and harm from evil spirits. For the sake of their deceased ancestors, parents, and honored kin, on the Five La Days—when Heaven and Earth grant amnesty—it is fitting to hold fasts, practice the Dao, bow in repentance, and submit petitions to rescue and transcend their ancestors, gaining boundless blessings.\n\nOn the first day of the first month, the Heavenly La Day, the Five Emperor Immortals gather in the Azure Heaven’s Peaceful Treasure Flower Grove at the Azure Spirit Palace to examine the registers of the world’s sins and blessings. On the fifth day of the fifth month, the Earthly La Day, the Five Emperor Immortals gather in the Cinnabar Heaven’s Brahma Treasure Prosperous Yang at the Vermilion Spirit Palace to examine the registers of the world’s sins and blessings. On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Daoist La Day, the Five Emperor Immortals gather in the Golden Gate’s Plain Spirit Palace to examine the registers of the world’s sins and blessings. On the first day of the tenth month, the People’s Year La Day, the Five Emperor Immortals gather in the Dark Heaven’s Cavern Yin at the Black Spirit Palace to examine the registers of the world’s sins and blessings.\"",

      "translated_text": "On the La Day that falls in the twelfth month—the La Day of Kings and Lords—the Five Emperors of the Five Directions gather in the Primordial Spirit’s Wu-Ji Golden Gate within the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis, in the Eight Radiance Hall of the Primordial Supreme Lord, to examine the registers of the world’s sins and blessings. These five La Days are the days when Heaven and Earth converge, when the ledgers of fortune, misfortune, life, and death are fixed.\n\nIf there are men and women who, for their past ancestors and parents, perform rites of repentance, submit petitions, and offer thanks for transgressions, they may erase names from the Black Register of sins and ascend to deliver their seven generations of ancestors, inscribing their names in the Upper Clarity. All shall thus attain deliverance.\n\nThese five La Days concern the nine generations of ancestors and parents of the living, as well as the ghostly souls in the Dark Mountain. On these days, the Great Emperor of the Northern Darkness of Fengdu summons them forth for interrogation, questioning those long confined in the nether courts, whose sins have accumulated over the ages, whose offenses and origins are bound to the names of their descendants and the locations of their graves. If, after kalpas of time, no redemption has been sought, the living shall be implicated on this day, their names and those of their kin and nine clans recorded as the living’s offenses, their transgressions bound to the dark courts, their nine clans doomed to annihilation.\n\nOn this day, one may submit petitions and perform rites of repentance for deceased ancestors and parents, redeeming them from the dark paths, so that each of the departed may attain deliverance. Daily sacrifices must not be neglected, for the depths of Fengdu are profound and difficult to penetrate; only by relying on true principles may one resolve past transgressions, release the souls from the dark courts, and prevent prolonged confinement. If the dead remain long confined, the Heavenly Offices shall hold the officials of the dark courts accountable, and the living shall also be held responsible. Blessings shall turn to misfortune, and calamities shall arise therefrom.\n\nIf there are filial sons and daughters who, on this day, observe fasts and offer jiao rites, their names shall be stricken from the Black Register, and they shall gain boundless blessings, all attaining deliverance.\n\nThe Primordial Supreme Lord addressed the attendant perfected ones at His side: \"The beings of the lower realms possess varying perceptions; their habits of evil and good, their roots and foundations, differ. I now speak these essential words, and all should believe and uphold them.\n\nIf beings engage in killing, harm, and injury, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Compassion.\nIf they steal, rob, or seize wealth, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Righteous Sharing.\nIf they indulge in licentiousness and debauchery, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Chastity.\nIf they are greedy, miserly, and stingy, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Almsgiving.\nIf they are wrathful and contentious, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Joy.\nIf they are foolish and deluded, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Expedient Means.\nIf they engage in frivolous and flowery speech, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Simplicity and Rectitude.\nIf they lie and deceive, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Faithfulness and Compliance.\nIf they curse and revile, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Recitation and Invocation.\nIf they slander and malign, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Praise and Admiration.\nIf they overindulge in wine and meat, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Fasting and Abstinence.\nIf they slander and defame, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Exposition and Teaching.\nIf they are arrogant and disdainful, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Reverence and Worship.\nIf they are stubborn and overbearing, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Gentleness and Humility.\nIf they disbelieve in the consequences of sins, blessings, and past lives, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Causes and Conditions.\nIf they cling to existence and nonexistence, they shall be gathered through the Gate of the Middle Way.\nIf they engage in disputes of right and wrong, self and other, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Equality.\nIf they are greedy, filthy, and defiled, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Purity.\nIf they are obstinate and unyielding, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Cyclic Transformation.\nIf they ceaselessly create and act, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Non-Action.\nIf they are rigid and unchanging, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Rounded Adaptation.\nIf they are restless and competitive, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Stillness and Concentration.\nIf they are afflicted and unable to let go, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Liberation.\nIf they are sorrowful and joyless, they shall be gathered through the Gate of Carefree Wandering.\n\nThrough these twenty-four gates, all shall be constantly gathered. Would not all beings find joy in this?\"\n\nThe Primordial Supreme Lord said: \"I originally gathered through non-gathering, exhorting and transforming all beings. Once beings awaken, there is also no cause for gathering. If one can uphold and observe these teachings, boundless blessings shall be attained.\"\n\nThe Primordial Supreme Lord again addressed the attendant perfected ones at His side: \"If among the multitudes of the lower realms there are faithful and devout followers of the Dao who, for the sake of their nine generations of ancestors and distant parents in the dark realms, establish the Three Clarities’ sacred thrones and light the Seven Luminaries’ bright lamps—whether in ancient temples and numinous altars or in purified chambers within their own homes—burn incense, perform the Dao, chant the Cavernous Chapters, recite scriptures and repent, and offer grand jiao rites to the myriad heavens with unwavering sincerity, I shall dispatch the Most High Sovereign of Salvation, the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion, to open the Seven-Treasure Cloud Tower in the Nine Qi Heavenly Palace, revealing the Golden Script of the Azure Tablets and proclaiming the august names of the Heavenly Worthies. Descending to the human realm, they shall enable all in heaven and earth to perform rites of reverence and invocation, erasing the records from the Jade Caskets of the Nine Dark Realms’ eternal night, so that the seven generations of ancestors may attain deliverance, their souls ascending to the Southern Palace, where immortals shall receive and guide them to carefree non-action, gaining boundless blessings.\n\nTherefore, burn incense, surrender body and life, prostrate with the five limbs touching the earth, and with sincere devotion, pay homage to:\n\nThe Jade Clarity Sacred Realm’s Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy,\nThe Upper Clarity True Realm’s Most High Dao Lord and Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy,\nThe Great Clarity Immortal Realm’s Most High Lord Lao and Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue,\nThe Most High Azure Heaven’s August Supreme Lord, the Golden Gate Jade Emperor,\nThe Purple Tenuity’s Supreme Palace’s Heavenly Emperor of the Southern Culmen,\nThe Purple Tenuity’s Central Palace’s Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen,\nThe Earthly Deity Who Upholds Heaven and Emulates the Law, the August and Illustrious Empress of Earth,\nThe Great Emperor of Longevity of the Southern Culmen, the Heavenly Worthy Who Governs Heaven and the Primordial Sage,\nThe Great Emperor of the Eastern Culmen of Azure Radiance, the Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion Who Saves from Suffering,\nThe Great Sage of True Illumination, the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation Who Responds to the Thunder’s Voice,\nThe Great Emperor and Thunder Ancestor of the Nine Heavens, the Heavenly Worthy Who Eliminates Disasters and Aids All Beings,\nThe Great Heavenly Emperor of the Purple Tenuity’s Azure Jade Palace Who Protects and Controls the Kalpas,\nThe Great Emperor of the Six Heavens’ Cavernous Abyss Who Subdues Demons, the Supreme Heavenly Worthy of the Great One,\nThe Lord Emperor of the Six Waves of Heaven Who Universally Bestows the Dharma’s Moisture,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Heavens’ Controller of the Red Mound Who Delivers Lives.\"",

They circled the jeweled terrace of kalpas’ height, all together praising and singing to the Primordial Lord of the Highest Origin, rejoicing in celebration.\n\nAt that time, the August One, with great majesty and virtue, emitted the seven-jeweled divine radiance, illuminating the vast heavens and reaching down to the boundless worlds, the Nine Dark Realms’ long-night hells.

      "translated_text": "Suddenly, the wailing cries of the dead souls in hell, undergoing interrogation and punishment, resounded in agony. Again, one saw the forsaken dead souls, unclaimed in the gloom, unrecorded by the ghostly officials.\n\nThen the Five Thearchs above inquired: \"What karmic retribution has this multitude of sinners committed to endure such unbearable torment? We beseech the Heavenly Compassion to grant them deliverance.\"\n\nThe Primordial Thearch addressed the Thearch Lords, saying: \"The dead souls of the Lower Kalpa endure this interrogation. For in former lives, they were disloyal and unfilial, their lord-subject bonds devoid of righteousness, their father-son ties lacking kindness. They disrespected the Three Luminaries, disbelieved in sin and blessing, deceived their masters and slandered the Dao, rebelled against their kin, wantonly slaughtered living beings, and indulged in greed and lust. The Life Mandate Officers stripped them of their allotted years, leaving their lifespans uncertain. Now, their dead souls face karmic reckoning, their kalpas exhausted with no release.\n\nThese souls, in former lives, were addicted to wine and meat, slaughtering without restraint. They performed no good deeds, devoted themselves solely to unrighteousness. Though their allotted years were not yet spent, the ghostly gods of the Six Heavens’ Cavernous Palaces seized upon their transgressions, unleashing plagues and pestilence. They met untimely deaths—by water, fire, bandits, epidemics, blades, or warfare—enduring hardships in public and private, entangled in disputes, shackled by slander, thwarted in all endeavors. For years and months uncounted, they suffered misfortune without respite.\n\nAgain, one saw the Wind-and-Thunder Hell, where black gales and crashing thunderbolts, jagged lightning and flying spears, assailed the sinners, tearing their limbs asunder, piercing their five viscera. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Fire-Glare Hell, where sinners swallowed flames and devoured coals, scorched by fire. Their faces and heads were charred, fire-mountains crowned their skulls, flames sprouting from their skin, flesh, and bones. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Diamond Hell, where sinners were beaten without number by iron hammers and metal rods. Their limbs rotted, their sinews and bones scattered. Iron forks pierced their bellies, metal hammers stuffed their hearts. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Dark-and-Cold Hell, where sinners were submerged in freezing ice, their sinews and bones severed by frost-edged blades. Cauldrons of venomous brew were poured upon them, their bodies disintegrating, their hearts and bellies ruptured. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Copper-Pillar Hell, where sinners embraced and climbed copper pillars engulfed in raging flames. Their outer and inner flesh charred and festered, their backs and bellies oozed pus. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Butchery Hell, where sinners were hung upside down, their bodies carved by blades. Their four limbs, sinews, skin, and five viscera were all sliced by knives. Blood flowed across the ground, their suffering beyond endurance. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Fire-Chariot Hell, where sinners were torn asunder by five chariots, their limbs scattered. Some were bound to fire-chariots, dragged east and west, north and south. Each wheel bristled with blades, slicing the sinners as the wheels turned, while raging fires roasted them to charred ruin. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nAgain, one saw the Cauldron Hell, where sinners were impaled by iron forks and plunged into boiling cauldrons. Their bodies were stewed and dissolved, their limbs rotted, their pus and blood reeking, their suffering beyond endurance. For ten thousand kalpas, they endured ceaseless torment, day and night.\n\nThen, the Primordial Thearch, the Ten Directions’ Savior-from-Suffering Heavenly Worthy, and the Deliverance Perfected Ones radiated their great majestic light, employing the six supernatural powers to command the sinful souls to close their eyes and silently reflect, recalling the days of their past lives and the evil deeds they had committed. Some had murdered their lords or fathers, been unfilial to their parents; some had slandered true immortals; some had harmed their brothers; some had plotted against their masters; some had committed incest with kin; some had robbed and killed; some had butchered the orphaned and poor, bullying the weak with strength; some had abused their power to oppress the vulnerable; some had defiled sacred texts; some had harbored secret malice and envy; some had wielded vicious tongues and sowed discord; some had incited strife among the good. For kalpas uncounted, they had accumulated these sins, now suddenly recalled in full. Each soul saw clearly, their sorrow and remorse redoubled. They longed for liberation, all beseeching deliverance.\n\nThe Primordial Thearch again addressed the attendant Perfected, saying: \"I see these sinners, for kalpas unending, have disbelieved in scriptures and repentance, devoted themselves solely to transgression. Thus, their names are inscribed in the ledgers of evil, their bodies consigned to the Nine Dark Realms, their souls trapped in the Three Wretched Paths, with no means of escape.\n\nIf there are faithful men and women who, for the sake of their deceased ancestors, parents, and kin, establish fasts, perform the Dao, prostrate in prayer, and present petitions; who aid the orphaned and poor, release living beings to extend life—then I shall dispatch the Great One Savior-from-Suffering Heavenly Worthy from the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace. There, he shall open the Three Heavenly Mystic Treasuries, the Sevenfold Jeweled Scriptures, the Jade Tablets and Coral Cases, and reveal the Heavenly Worthy’s august names. Descending to the mortal realm, he shall praise and chant, reciting the Cavernous Chapters, dissolving their sins, erasing their names from the eternal night of the Nine Dark Realms. The Jade Casket’s cases shall be distributed, enabling all sinful souls to escape suffering, attain liberation, and follow their wishes to be reborn, carefree and unconstrained, all achieving transcendence.\n\nTherefore, burn incense, surrender body and life, prostrate with the five limbs touching the earth. With wholehearted devotion, pay homage to:\n\nThe Jade Clarity’s Sacred Realm, the Void-and-Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Treasure;\nThe Highest Clarity’s True Realm, the Supreme Lord of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Treasure;\nThe Grand Clarity’s Immortal Realm, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue;\nThe Supreme August Heavenly Thearch of the Golden Portal and Jade Capital;\nThe Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Heavenly Thearch of the Southern Culmen, the Great Emperor of the Celestial August;\nThe Purple Tenuity’s Central Palace, the Heavenly Thearch of the Northern Culmen, the Great Emperor of the Central August;\nThe Earthly Thearch Who Upholds Heaven and Emulates the Law, the August and Illustrious Queen of the Earth;\nThe Great Emperor of Longevity of the Southern Culmen, the Heavenly Worthy Who Unifies Heaven and the Primordial Sage;\nThe Great Emperor of the Eastern Culmen of Azure Radiance, the Heavenly Worthy of Great One Savior-from-Suffering;\nThe Great Sage of Luminous Constancy, the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation Who Responds to the Nine Heavens with Thunderous Voice.\"",

Receiving form after form, they are ensnared by afflictions, all arising from deluded thoughts, inverted views, and attachments to life, death, existence, and annihilation. Unable to liberate themselves, they are most pitiable.\"\n\nAt that moment, within the Dharma assembly, the Perfected of Golden Splendor and the Perfected of Vast Blessings, bearing tablets and adorned with pendants, stepped forth from the ranks to burn incense and prostrate before the Golden Portal of the Celestial Emperor: \"We, having accumulated profound goodness, now dwell in the Jade Clarity and are privileged to attend at your side, reverently hearing the Dharma’s teachings and receiving instruction for all beings.

      "translated_text": "When they commit transgressions, they know no fear. Some invoke ghosts and spirits, seeking their aid; others point to the Three Luminaries and their seven generations of ancestors, swearing false oaths. They turn kin against kin, inflicting harm and slaughter without principle. As their lives draw to an end, they cling to their homes, wealth, and treasures, cherishing their own bodies and gazing back with longing at wives and daughters, their hearts gripped by desperate attachment. Or they utter wicked vows, and their creditors and enemies appear before them. Sinking into the Five Paths, they find no escape.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Heavenly Compassion to open wide its mercy, deliver all beings, and lead them out of the dark realms, that all may awaken to the Dao.\n\nThen the Most High Lord of the Primordial Dao addressed the attendant Perfected Ones: \"I observe that the beings below, lost in deluded thoughts and inverted views, all arise from the heart. They forcibly create distinctions, their minds struck by fleeting impulses, and upon encountering circumstances, they fall into confusion. Every thought they conceive is false. They must steady their resolve and contemplate their bodies with wisdom—bone, flesh, skin, limbs, hair, the six roots, the four great elements, the five viscera, and the hundred spirits. When they carefully reflect and ponder, they find no true substance. All is but a temporary aggregation, a confluence of illusory forms. Searching within and without, where is the self to be found? Since the body is but an illusion, the heart becomes empty. Emptiness and illusion are not real; all is but deluded thought. Right and wrong, love and hatred, attachment to forms and sounds, scents, tastes, touches, and dharmas—jealousy, stinginess, greed, killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, deceitful speech, harsh words, all such deeds—vanish entirely. With inner and outer purity and emptiness, one awakens to the true Dao.\"\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Dao addressed the attendant Perfected Ones: \"When you contemplate the body with settled wisdom, you find no true substance. Those who cling to false views do so because their six roots and three karmic actions remain impure. The six roots are: the eye root, the ear root, the nose root, the tongue root, the body root, and the mind root. These six roots give rise to all karmic actions, just as grasses and trees produce flowers, leaves, seeds, and fruits. In turn, the six emotions, six thieves, and six desires generate all karmic actions. If one employs wisdom to reflect, the karmic actions of the six roots are all exhausted.\n\nThe three karmic actions are: bodily karma, mental karma, and verbal karma. Bodily karma includes killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; mental karma includes stinginess, greed, and anger; verbal karma includes deceitful speech, falsehoods, harsh words, and divisive speech. Together, these form the ten evils. When one carefully reflects, all ten evils are seen as insubstantial. By gradually eliminating the three karmic actions and the six roots, diminishing them again and again, and persisting in this practice over time, one naturally awakens to the true Dao.\"\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Dao addressed the Perfected Ones attending on either side: \"I pity the beings below, who for kalpas uncounted have set their minds and intentions upon falsehoods, lacking in sincerity and truth, indulging in deceitful speech. Some utter such speech before the sacred images of the Heavenly Worthies; others do so before the scriptures and Daoist altars; still others before their parents and revered elders, before the wise and the venerable, before the powerful and the noble, or before those of keen understanding. Even before the divine assemblies of the heavens, the sun, moon, and stars, their every thought is tainted with deceitful speech. Their sins are grave indeed. Today, before the sacred altar of the Three Treasures, they repent and seek forgiveness, praying that all may be cleansed.\n\nI pity these beings, whose bodies and minds give rise to deceitful speech, falsehoods, harsh words, divisive speech, jealousy toward those who surpass them, and the stirring of strife and contention. They sever the bonds of kinship, turn falsehood into truth, and transform deception into reality. Today, through repentance, may all be purified, and may they enter the root of faith.\"\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Dao addressed the Perfected Ones attending on either side: \"I observe that the beings below, from the moment they assume form, employ their eyes, ears, nose, and tongue to conceive evil—killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, dissipation, stinginess, greed, anger, delusion, inverted views, deceitful speech, falsehoods, harsh words, divisive speech, jealousy toward those who surpass them, consuming alcohol and meat, violating the Three Luminaries, turning from truth toward falsehood, believing in perverse and inverted views, sacrificing to ghosts and spirits, failing to honor the Three Treasures, slandering and reviling, arrogance and contempt, indulgence in sensual desires, attachment to scents and flavors, sinking into infatuation with touch and dharmas, creating evil within and without, each giving rise to the other. The six roots interact, compounding transgressions, their roots of sin growing ever deeper. With every thought, they commit wrongs, accumulating boundless sins over time, all lodged within their bodies, beyond reckoning.\n\nYet with a single thought of the heart, all may be purified. It is like a bright mirror covered in dust, its surface obscured by grease and grime, accumulating into cataracts that cloud its inner and outer radiance. But when it encounters a skilled craftsman who wipes, polishes, and cleanses it, its surface and depths become luminous once more, reflecting near and far as it did in the beginning. Why is this so? Because its nature is fundamentally pure. So too is the human condition: the spirit is inherently pure, free from all defilement. Yet after assuming form, one gradually becomes tainted by transgressions—the six roots, six emotions, six thieves, six desires, and the discriminations of the six consciousnesses—creating defilements and obscurations. The body becomes an obstacle, and one loses the true nature, drifting through the cycles of birth and death, ever falling into the roots of sin. Entangled in karmic retribution, one enters hell, suffering myriad torments, revolving through ten thousand kalpas.\n\nOut of compassion, I pity these beings and have, from kalpa to kalpa, turned the wheel in the human realm, appearing now among the barbarians, now among the Chinese, now old, now young, now noble, now base, employing every expedient means to teach and deliver them. The scriptural teachings have spread, awakening all beings, that they may escape suffering and forever depart from the hells. Yet beings are dull-witted and fail to comprehend. Therefore, I now distinguish for you the causes and conditions of sin and merit, that all beings may attain liberation.\"\n\nThe Most High Lord of the Primordial Dao addressed the assembly of Perfected Ones: \"If there are faithful men and women below who receive and uphold this scripture, burn incense, and repent, washing away all the sufferings within their bodies, they shall attain purity and dissolve the boundless, measureless roots of past evil karma.\"",

      "translated_text": "Master Chongmiao prostrated before the Golden Portal of the Celestial Emperor and offered this hymn of praise:\n\n\"The Jade Emperor proclaims the celestial decree,\nUniversally releasing souls from the dark of night.\nThe Eight Difficulties all dissolve,\nThe Five Paths all open wide.\nFengdu’s retributions cease,\nAnd they ascend to the Crimson Palace on high.\nAll beings awaken to the supreme Dao,\nForever enjoying boundless fortune.\"\n\n*Thus concludes Scroll Six of the Supreme Lingbao Repentance for Atonement Before Heaven*\n\n*Scroll Seven of the Supreme Lingbao Repentance for Atonement Before Heaven begins*\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Venerable was in the Jade Clarity Palace within the Great Canopy Heaven, seated upon the Five-Cloud Celestial Treasure Wondrous Terrace. He gathered the celestial immortals, terrestrial immortals, aquatic immortals, the numinous perfected of the Three Realms, and an immeasurable host. All proceeded to the Celestial Pass, ascending to the Jade Clarity, burning incense and scattering flowers, pacing the void in circumambulation, and prostrating before the Most August.\n\nThen, the Celestial Venerable radiated his majestic light and broadly expounded the wondrous Dharma, vowing to deliver all beings and enable their awakening to the Dao.\n\nAt that moment, the Perfected of Supreme Clarity, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, and the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct stepped forward, burned incense, and prostrated before the Most August, saying: \"Since time immemorial, we have been graced to dwell among the ranks of the perfected and honorably attend the jeweled portals. Each time we hear the numinous sounds, we awaken the dust-bound multitudes. We constantly contemplate the myriad people below, adrift in the sea of desire, tossed upon the waves of love, ceaselessly revolving through birth and death. We know not what meritorious deeds might enable them to escape this sinking abyss and attain complete deliverance.\"\n\nThen, the Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the attendant perfected at his side, saying: \"If there are faithful men and women in the world below who perpetually engage in acts of benefit, restraining their mouths and mortifying their bodies, bestowing alms of wealth and treasure, and constantly cultivating fields of merit—extending aid to birds, beasts, and all creatures possessing consciousness, universally relieving hunger and cold—this is foremost among all deeds.\n\n\"If they dig wells by the roadside, construct dwellings, plant orchards and groves, and succor the weary and suffering; or if they build bridges across rivers to ferry travelers, diligently and tirelessly performing such acts—then the host of sages will guard their bodies, and they shall accrue boundless merit.\"\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the attendant perfected at his side, saying: \"I pity the multitude of beings entangled in the Three Poisons and Ten Evils, beset by demonic sprites, malevolent ghosts, evil spirits, venomous insects, fierce beasts, weapons of war, fire and flood, fetters and prisons, illness and suffering, calamities and misfortunes, unable to find peace.\n\n\"For this reason, I expound for you the great Dharma of the Three Caverns, the talismanic scriptures and precious sutras, to save and protect the world and grant it peace and happiness. Yet beings, deluded and ignorant, fail to recognize sin and merit, indulging their six senses. Some kill living beings, steal, engage in licentiousness and debauchery, hoard with greed, seethe with anger, wallow in ignorance and delusion, utter deceitful and frivolous speech, slander with malicious words, and devour the flesh of living creatures. They defy heaven and earth, forsake the true and follow the perverse, sacrifice to ghosts and spirits, committing a multitude of sins without a single good deed. Thus, poisonous winds and malevolent qi, the demonic ghosts of the Six Heavens, pervade the human realm, perpetuating slaughter day and night without cease. I grieve deeply for them.\n\n\"I constantly dispatch the Celestial Emperor Kings, the Ten Ultimate Immortals, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors to inspect and deliver them, enabling all to awaken and transcend, avoiding the multitude of evils, and dissolving their long-standing transgressions.\"\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable again addressed the celestial immortals at his side, saying: \"I observe that since time without beginning, ordinary beings have sunk into the suffering of sin, creating manifold evil karma—killing living beings, stealing, engaging in licentiousness and debauchery, hoarding with greed, seething with anger, wallowing in ignorance and delusion, slandering with malicious words, uttering deceitful and frivolous speech, devouring the flesh of creatures, destroying lives, defying heaven and earth, disbelieving in sin and merit. The weight of their karmic deeds is immeasurable.\n\n\"They may establish the precious thrones of the Three Clarities and the stellar altars of the Five Emperors in the sacred halls of temples or within the pure chambers of their own homes. Burning incense and scattering flowers, they may prostrate before heaven and earth, repent and present memorials, beseeching the dissolution of their transgressions. Thus, their bodies and dwellings shall be purified, and all calamities shall be entirely eradicated, accruing boundless merit.\n\n\"If emperors, kings, empresses, imperial consorts, princes, or celestial descendants arouse the supreme aspiration and invite Daoist masters and ritual masters to establish a ritual arena in the main palace hall or a pure Daoist chamber for the sake of their seven generations of ancestors, seven generations of lineage, deceased parents, and all kin—reciting scriptures, performing repentance rituals, burning incense and lighting lamps, repenting and practicing the Dao, bestowing alms of wealth, clothing, and bedding, releasing living beings to extend their lives, and broadly conducting fasts and offerings with unwavering devotion—then I shall dispatch the Ten Celestial Perfected, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, and the Ten Upright Numinous Officials to descend and observe.\n\n\"If their minds and bodies remain steadfast, the sick shall recover, the dead shall revive, the imperiled shall be delivered, the imprisoned shall be freed, travelers shall return, and officials shall be promoted. Water, fire, weapons of war, tigers, wolves, venomous beasts, evil spirits, and demonic sprites—all calamities and difficulties—shall never afflict their bodies. Their years shall be long, and each shall attain peace and tranquility.\n\n\"If, for the sake of deceased ancestors, they aspire to liberate them from the Nine Dark Hells, the Knife Mountains, the Sword Trees, the Cauldrons of Boiling Oil, and the torments of whips and cudgels, enabling them to ascend to the celestial halls, roam freely in non-action, and awaken to the supreme Dao—\n\n\"If, for emperors, empresses, princes, the people, the land, and all beings, they recite scriptures and perform repentance rituals to save and protect all, they shall enjoy peace in this life and accrue boundless merit.\n\n\"If weapons of war arise on all sides, harming the myriad people, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rituals shall cause them to retreat and disperse without inflicting harm.\n\n\"If epidemics spread and the people lie stricken with illness, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rituals shall bring immediate recovery and peace to the multitude.\n\n\"If floods and droughts disrupt the balance, harming the five grains, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rituals shall bring timely wind and rain, and the hundred grains shall flourish.\n\n\"If malevolent winds and poisonous qi, scorching fires, and conflagrations consume dwellings, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rituals shall harmonize the celestial qi, and all things shall be pure and moist.\n\n\"If evil ghosts, venomous insects, and fierce beasts harm people, reciting scriptures and performing repentance rituals shall cause them all to retreat and flee.\"",

It safeguards nations and households, harmonizes Heaven and stabilizes Earth, dissolves celestial disasters above, and averts poisonous harm below. Its blessings are beyond measure, universally delivering gods and humans.\"\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao spoke again to the perfected attendants: \"For the sake of all beings, I have broadly established fields of merit, greatly constructing virtuous deeds—copying scriptures, creating images, founding temples to deliver people, reciting scriptures, performing repentance rituals, holding purification fasts, and practicing almsgiving. The karmic rewards are towering and truly profound.\n\nWhy is this so? Wealth is the lifeblood of beings, deeply cherished and hard to relinquish. Yet those who can surrender their lives and possessions without stinginess, widely establishing merit and aiding the destitute and impoverished, inwardly stilling greed and outwardly eliminating bandits and thieves, shall profit both humans and gods, and in life and death receive grace. The merit of such salvation brings boundless blessings, and even the seven generations of ancestral spirits shall all be delivered.\"\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao addressed the perfected attendants at his side, saying: \"I and the host of immortals gaze down upon all beings, whose lives are like mayflies—born at dawn, dead by dusk—truly pitiable and sorrowful.\n\nWhen a person dies, the cycles of the Five Agents are exhausted, their qi severed and spirit departed, marrow drained and bones withered, their form desolate. Their heart trembles in fear, their spirit quakes in dread. At the moment of parting from life, they endure great suffering. Their inner and outer kin surround them, sons and daughters weeping in grief, the departing soul terrified, not knowing where it will go. As the body grows cold and hollow, and the last breath fades, the evil deeds and transgressions of their lifetime appear before them.\n\nIf one has accumulated goodness in past lives, heavenly beings shall support and protect them, and their soul shall ascend to realms of bliss. If one has accumulated transgressions in life, ox-headed demons and rakshasas shall drive them into hell, where they shall endure every torment.\n\nAt such a time, the mighty and noble, the proud and wealthy, all vanish in an instant. Fine carriages and grand steeds—what concern are they now? Estates, gold, and treasures all belong to others. Wives, children, and kin—can they take one’s place? All karmic adversaries stand before them, like shadows following form, inescapable.\n\nYet if faithful men and women make grand vows, offering great sacrifices to Heaven and Earth on behalf of deceased parents and all ancestral kin, submitting memorials and petitions, reciting true scriptures—it shall be as darkness finding light, as illness finding medicine, as poverty finding treasure, as hunger finding food, as a prisoner finding release, as drought finding rain. Their sins shall be washed away, and all shall be purified, ascending to halls of blessing, escaping the Five Sufferings, and attaining eternal deliverance.\"\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao spoke again to the perfected attendants at his side: \"In the ten directions of the world below, if devout and faithful men and women of the Dao, on behalf of suffering souls in hell or sin-laden evil ghosts, establish the precious altars of the Three Clarities and the sacred altars of the Five Emperors, burn incense and light lamps, offer rare delicacies and exotic fruits, submit memorials and petitions, and hold grand sacrifices to the hosts of heaven—for all creatures, whether the six livestock or flocks of fur and feather, donkeys, mules, oxen, or horses burdened by heavy karmic sins—I shall dispatch the Most High Lord of Salvation, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Unity, to open the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace and the precious caskets of jade registers. The august names of the Heavenly Worthies shall be proclaimed, and all people below shall be transmitted and delivered.

Suddenly, the gates of heaven trembled violently, and the Primordial Celestial Venerable, with his divine radiance, illuminated below. There appeared a dense, black, noxious, blood-red qi rising to assail the heavenly gates, coiling and lingering without dispersal. This qi reeked of blood and filth, startling the assembled host.\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable addressed the celestial great sages and perfected ones at his side: \"Below, in the vast and boundless Dark Sea of the great wilderness, whose depths are unfathomable, stands a great mountain piercing the azure vault above and descending into the windy springs below, named the Northern Yin Fengdu Mount Luo. It is the master of yin qi and the pivot of the nine earths. Beneath it lies a great cavern called the Palace of the Yin Realm, wherein resides the Supreme Yin Water Emperor. Within the Northern Yin Celestial Lord are myriad officials of the netherworld, and the mountain holds three palaces, nine bureaus, and thirty-six great iron hells. The grasses and trees of this mountain naturally emit toxic qi, transforming all into blades and swords. Their edges flash through the air, black smoke billows, and malevolent winds howl ceaselessly day and night—all places where the netherworld officials torture and punish sinful ghosts and the dead.\n\nWithin are six palaces of great demonic evil spirits who, seeing sentient beings lost in darkness and delusion, descend in formations to the human realm, wantonly creating monstrous calamities, harming the living, and entangling the souls of the seven generations of deceased ancestors. They bring forth all manner of disasters, malignant illnesses, plagues, and toxic qi, causing indiscriminate death and untimely harm—so pitiable that one cannot bear to hear of it.\n\nThen the attendant perfected ones, arrayed in ranks, burned incense and memorialized, prostrating themselves and beseeching the Most Venerable to open the power of great compassion and wisdom, to save and deliver all beings, that both the living and the dead may receive grace and escape the suffering of sin. They implored: 'May all sinners be spared the three calamities of the present world, the nine misfortunes, the five pestilences, the seven afflictions, the myriad diseases, the toxic qi, and the perils of demonic spirits and ghosts. May their lives be free from harm.'\"",

      "translated_text": "Should you deign to show compassion, then lift your gaze and receive the sacred words.\n\nThereupon the Most Venerable addressed the attendant perfected ones, saying: \"I pity all beings as a mother cherishes her child. Now, for your sake, I shall expound these wondrous words—heed them well, and hold them fast in your hearts.\"\n\nThe attendant perfected ones and all divine immortals bowed their heads to the ground, listening to the sacred decree of the Primordial Sovereign of the Dao.\n\nIn ancient times, the people were simple and guileless, free from malice, following the natural course of their fate. They fulfilled their allotted years without untimely harm. But in this degenerate age, human hearts have grown shallow and corrupt, rupturing the five emotions. Discord and deception prevail, deceit and delusion intertwine. They no longer speak of true cultivation but indulge in perverse conduct, forsaking the real for the false, abandoning the Dao and virtue. They defy heaven and earth, usurp ministers and overthrow rulers, disloyal and unfilial, devoid of love and compassion. They deceive and mislead the common folk, oppress and tyrannize the people, wrongfully kill living beings, and cruelly harm all life. They forge countless karmic enmities, inviting manifold calamities.\n\nSome engage in robbery and plunder, committing murder and injury. Others fall prey to malevolent demons that destroy their bodies. Some suffer the bites of venomous snakes, tigers, wolves, or poisonous insects. Others face official disasters, slanderous tongues, or unjust imprisonment—beaten, bound, exiled, or sentenced to penal servitude. Some households are struck by plagues, their bodies afflicted by toxic qi, their kin ravaged by illness and death, their families torn asunder. Some are struck down by celestial thunder, others consumed by heavenly fire. All such transgressions arise from the weight of accumulated karma.\n\nThe qi of slaughter from the Six Heavens and the legions of ghosts from the Northern Feng, together with the deities of the Five Peaks and the ghostly marshals of the slain, roam the world, seizing upon the faults of sinners to unleash their toxic qi. They slaughter the wicked, who in turn prey upon one another, leading to death, the ruin of households, and the extinction of descendants. Witnessing this, I am deeply grieved—so pitiable that one cannot bear to hear of it.\n\nYet if there are those in the world who uphold the Dao, who awaken the supreme mind, who generously bestow wealth to relieve the destitute, who release living beings to extend their lives, who recite scriptures and repent with unwavering devotion—then above, they will dispel calamities, and below, they will avert myriad disasters.\n\nShould a land be plagued by unending warfare and pestilence, if its people sincerely recite this repentance and observe pure fasts, then the scourge of war will cease, malevolent forces will withdraw, heaven and humanity will rejoice, and the nation will know peace.\n\nIf one finds themselves in the wilderness, pursued by tigers or wolves, let them sincerely invoke this scripture and vow to recite it—then protective deities will come to their aid, and the beasts will retreat, causing no harm.\n\nIf one ventures upon the sea and encounters fierce winds, let them vow to recite this scripture—then the waves will calm, and they will reach the shore.\n\nIf one is caught amidst the blades of battle, let them vow to recite this scripture—then weapons will vanish, and no harm will come.\n\nIf one is imprisoned in shackles, let them vow to recite this scripture—then their wrongs will be redressed, and they will surely be freed.\n\nIf one is tormented by malevolent spirits or demonic entities, let them vow to recite this scripture—then the spirits will vanish, daring not to cause harm.\n\nWhen the day of one’s death arrives and their soul enters the Nine Dark Hells, if their family—sons, daughters, husbands, or wives—establishes a Nine Darks fast and ritual, offering reverence to the Three Palaces, then the soul will transcend the Five Sufferings and be reborn according to its merit.\n\nUpon hearing this scripture, the sinners in the Nine Dark Hells will awaken in body and mind, all arousing the intention for the Dao, never to retreat. Thereupon, heaven will respond by sending a decree to release the imprisoned souls, and all will be delivered.\n\nIn that moment, the Black Registers of the Nine Darks will be consumed in flames, the flames of Fire Mountains will subside, the waves of Ice Pools will still, and those who once swallowed fire and ate coals will taste sweet dew. The golden hammers and iron rods will transform into lotus blossoms. Divine immortals will lift them up to ascend to the Southern Palace, where all will be reborn.\n\nThrough the great power of the Primordial Sovereign of the Dao and the boundless compassion of the Most Venerable, all beings will be saved, their bodies and minds purified, liberated from the Fengdu Hell, and reborn according to their wishes.\n\nThen the Savior from Suffering Perfected One is commanded to open the Terrace of Yang, to unfurl the Jade Chest of Purple Scripts, and to proclaim the august name of the Heavenly Worthy.\n\nYou should establish the Three Clarities’ sacred thrones and the Five Emperors’ numinous altars, hang banners and offer flowers, array rare delicacies and exotic fruits, present solemn offerings, recite scriptures and repentances, submit memorials and petitions, and perform rituals to give thanks to the stellar hosts of the heavens, the Five Emperors, and the Three Officials. Burn incense and light lamps, chant the cavernous hymns, and beseech the erasure of the Nine Darks’ Jade Casket of Everlasting Night from the Registers of Luminous Perfection—so that all imprisoned souls may escape suffering, their boundless sins dissolved, and boundless blessings attained, to rely upon in life and death.\n\nThus, with incense burning, we surrender body and life, prostrating ourselves in full devotion. With sincere hearts, we bow in reverence to:\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning, the Void and Spontaneous, of the Sacred Realm of Jade Clarity;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure, the Most High Dao Lord, of the True Realm of Supreme Clarity;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue, the Most High Lord Lao, of the Immortal Realm of Grand Clarity;\nThe Most August Jade Emperor of the Golden Gates, the Supreme Sovereign of the Vast Heaven;\nThe Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity, Lord of the Southern Culmen, of the Supreme Palace;\nThe Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen, Lord of the Central Palace of Purple Tenuity;\nThe August Earthly Sovereign, the August Queen of the Earth, Who Upholds Heaven and Emulates the Law, of Vast Virtue and Radiant Glory;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Sage, the Great Emperor of Longevity of the Southern Culmen;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Great Compassion, the Great Emperor of Azure Radiance of the Eastern Culmen;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Universal Transformation, the Great Sage of Luminous Response, the Thunder of Nine Heavens;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Disaster Relief, the Thunder Ancestor of the Nine Heavens;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Effortless Protection, the Great Emperor of the Great Unity of the Azure Jade Palace;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Unity, the Great Emperor of the Abyssal Caverns of the Six Heavens, Who Subdues Demons;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Universal Grace, the Heavenly Lord of the Six Waves;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Vermilion Mound, the Celestial Elder Who Measures the Nine Heavens;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Transformation, the Celestial Inspector of the Nine Heavens, Who Preserves the Mandate;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Cavernous Void, the Primordial Elder of Azure Radiance of the Nine Qi of the Eastern Heaven;\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Cavernous Clarity, the True Elder of Vermilion Radiance of the Three Qi of the Southern Heaven.",

      "translated_text": "We observe that all sentient beings below are benighted in body and mind, unaware of the wondrous transformations of the Numinous Treasure’s spontaneous efficacy—how then may they be saved and delivered? Many suffer the six premature deaths and five injuries, the hundred spirits and nine grotesqueries; malevolent ghosts roam widely, pestilential poisons and myriad diseases arise, giving rise to calamities and misfortunes. Creditors and adversaries, slanderous tongues, and ceaseless wailing fill the air; human hearts are stricken with sorrow and dread. Cold and heat arise within, illness manifests without. They pray to unorthodox spirits, offer blood sacrifices in pursuit of blessings, and recklessly prognosticate fortune and misfortune, entangling themselves in a hundred monstrosities. Thus they incur guilt before the Three Officials, and the Ten Directing Spirits, the Deities of Destiny, and the Recorders inscribe their transgressions, submitting them to the Celestial Treasury. Their allotted years and blessings are stripped away, their lifespans shortened by the stroke of fate. They die by their own hands or are born into suffering, with no means of liberation.\n\nAt times, the Five Bushel Star Officials report omens of change: disasters, floods, droughts, unseasonable winds and rains, the fourfold rise of warfare, pestilence, and death. The sovereign is filled with anxiety, the common people plunged into misery, with no means of deliverance. We humbly beseech the Celestial Compassion of the Most High to safeguard the nation’s destiny, deliver the multitudes of the people, and radiantly proclaim the transformative power of the Dao, that all sentient beings may awaken to and comprehend the Orthodox and True, and all attain transcendence.\n\nThen the Most High Primordial Lord addressed the Perfected attendants at his side: “Since the beginningless kalpas, I have constantly dwelt among humankind, teaching and delivering sentient beings, that the ten directions, the Three Realms, and all beings—mundane and sacred, celestial and human—might universally attain liberation, abide in serene constancy, and neither arise nor perish. By upholding the precepts, reciting the scriptures, and broadly establishing fields of merit, one may deliver and liberate sentient beings. All the sages revere this, all demons bow in submission, and their names are inscribed in the Upper Clarity.”\n\n“I pity sentient beings for their benightedness in body and mind, unable to hear the teachings. Now, for your sake, I proclaim the Ten Supreme Precepts, which generate blessings for humans and devas, create good karma in life and death, bestow blessings, and dispel calamities—yielding boundless recompense.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Perfected attendants: “The first precept: the multitudes of the lower realms must not kill, nor harbor the thought of killing, nor kill deliberately or out of greed. They must constantly practice compassion, delivering all sentient beings, and regard all beings as themselves.\n\nThe second precept: they must not steal, nor harbor the thought of theft. They must constantly practice yielding and decline ill-gotten gains, regarding all wealth and treasures as their own.\n\nThe third precept: they must not engage in licentiousness, nor harbor lustful thoughts. They must constantly practice purity, dwelling in seclusion amidst the scenery, and regard all men and women as their own flesh and blood.\n\nThe fourth precept: they must not be covetous or greedy, nor harbor greedy thoughts. They must constantly practice generosity, broadly aiding the poor, maintaining equanimity of mind, and making no distinction between self and others.\n\nThe fifth precept: they must not give way to anger, nor harbor angry thoughts. They must constantly practice joy, reconciling enemies and kin, and regard all sentient beings as their own children.\n\nThe sixth precept: they must not be deluded, nor harbor deluded thoughts. They must constantly practice wisdom, guiding the ignorant and confused, and regard all sentient beings as their own hands and feet.\n\nThe seventh precept: they must not engage in frivolous speech, nor harbor frivolous thoughts. They must constantly practice integrity, maintaining inner and outer harmony, and regard the scriptures and precepts with constant recitation.\n\nThe eighth precept: they must not speak falsely, nor harbor false thoughts. They must constantly practice sincerity, concealing nothing and deceiving none, and regard all people without false imaginings.\n\nThe ninth precept: they must not engage in harsh speech, cursing, or any form of verbal abuse. They must constantly maintain right mindfulness, never giving rise to malicious intent, and regard venomous serpents as self-generating their own poison.\n\nThe tenth precept: they must not sow discord among relatives and friends with divisive speech. They must constantly practice uprightness, never fostering partiality, and regard all beings without notions of favor or aversion.”\n\nThe Most High Primordial Lord addressed the Perfected attendants at his side: “These precepts I proclaim are the city walls and dwelling houses of sentient beings. Men and women who uphold them will constantly have Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, Vajra Warriors, and the Ten Celestial Benevolent Spirits attending and guarding them at their sides. They will dispel calamities, transcend adversities, preserve life, and prolong existence. Immortals will revere them, deities will guard their gates. Swords and weapons, water and fire, tigers and wolves, venomous serpents, illnesses, imprisonment, demonic thieves, malevolent spirits, hunger, cold, suffering, and all disasters and misfortunes will not afflict them. Those who seek sons will have sons; those who seek daughters will have daughters. Wealth, honor, longevity, and joy will follow their hearts’ desires. They will possess wisdom and intelligence, their forms and appearances will be upright and proper, and their merit and virtue will be towering and inconceivable.\n\nIf good-hearted men and women perform repentance rites, practice the Dao, uphold the precepts, and cultivate goodness, it will be like a precious sword cutting through all obstacles, like a Dharma boat ferrying all across, like a raging fire burning all away, like pure water washing all clean. From the Three Clarities downward to the perfected immortals of the ten directions, none fail to uphold these scriptures and precepts. The precepts serve to prevent wrongdoing and halt evil, to discipline body and mind, subdue external demons, and move the numinous immortals—yielding boundless blessings.”\n\nThe Most High Primordial Lord addressed the Perfected attendants at his side: “I observe that the sentient beings of the lower realms, since the beginningless kalpas, have taken human form only to indulge in stinginess, greed, and sensual desires, drinking wine and eating meat without restraint. They nourish their flesh and blood, fostering pus and filth, thereby generating illness and affliction, deepening the roots of sin, and enduring the sufferings of birth, old age, sickness, and death. Heat, dampness, wind, and cold assail them; pain, itching, aches, and soreness afflict them. Malignant winds and toxic qi enter their bodies, infecting their forms with a hundred diseases. Moment by moment, impermanence prevails; day and night, they weep in sorrow.\n\nTheir births and endowments of consciousness differ, yet day and night they cycle through myriad births and deaths. Some dwell in the womb, congealing into pus and blood, only to dissolve and vanish. Others remain in the mother’s belly, unable to be born; if born, they perish at once. Though briefly separated from their mothers, they die immediately—beyond count. Some live one or two years, others a hundred, yet in every moment they change, their essence and qi waning. Headaches and fevers, a thousand afflictions assail them. In their entire lives, they know little peace. This is truly due to their gluttonous consumption of filth, filling their bodies, the fumes of wine and meat steaming their organs, malignant winds and toxic qi fanning their frames, minerals and metals dissolving their forms—so that their bodies do not endure.”",

      "translated_text": "At that time, the Golden Flower Perfected One, the Jade Purity Perfected One, the Wondrous Conduct Perfected One, and the Savior from Suffering Perfected One burned incense and prostrated before the Most Venerable, presenting a memorial that said: \"We now behold the multitudes of the lower realms, many of whom fail to believe and revere, indulging their bodies and minds, perpetuating cruel and poisonous deeds, slaughtering living beings, committing the three poisons of oral karma—so grave are their transgressions that the Ten Upright Deities, the Life-Recording and Register-Keeping Officials, record their crimes and submit them to the Celestial Treasury. Through kalpas unending, their sins entangle them, leaving no means of deliverance. Rewards and punishments, blessings and misfortunes are meted out with the precision of a hair’s breadth.\n\nWe see that those among the multitudes who accumulate goodness in life and perpetually practice hidden virtue are sheltered by the qi of Heaven, borne by the qi of Earth, illumined by the stars, revered by ghosts and spirits, followed by the Five Fortunes, and distanced from a thousand calamities. Yet those who accumulate transgressions and perpetrate cruel deeds in life are unsheltered by Heaven, unborne by Earth, unillumined by the stars, harmed by ghosts and spirits, distanced from the Five Fortunes, and followed by a thousand calamities. We observe this with profound sorrow and beseech the Celestial Compassion of the Most Venerable to broadly open the expedient means of salvation, universally delivering all beings to awakening and liberation from defilement.\"\n\nThen the Most Venerable addressed the great Perfected Ones, saying: \"I pity the myriad beings of the lower worlds as if they were my own children, desiring that all attain the Dao. Yet the sins of these beings run deep, and they dwell long in impurity, indulging their passions and desires, wallowing in defilement. In life, they perpetually indulge in lust. Some commit lewd acts within palaces, beneath the stars, or in sacred temples. Others do so in spirit shrines or at communal altars. Some seize and harm others, separating children from mothers, tearing lovers apart, severing bonds of affection, and cutting off tender care. Some engage in incest with kin, or unite with relatives. Others seduce slaves or servants, heedless of beauty or ugliness, wisdom or folly. Some oppress men and women, or sunder husbands and wives. Others defile the ordained, or bare themselves before Heaven and Earth, violating the four classes, indulging in every manner of lust, their minds filled with vile dreams, their couplings unrestrained. They give free rein to the six senses, their transgressions boundless, ensnaring body and mind, clouding the six consciousnesses, depleting their essence and qi, and amassing grave sins. Today, through repentance and purification, may all these transgressions be utterly eradicated.\"\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable again addressed the attendant Perfected Ones at his side, saying: \"I see that men and women of the lower realms, from the moment they conceive the intent to act, constantly engage in theft. Some steal sacred images of the Celestial Venerable, scriptures, Dharma treasures, or other property. Others steal from ordained Dharma masters, or from sacred temples and stellar altars. Some pilfer funds meant for the creation of revered images, or the estates and permanent assets of monasteries. Others take offerings meant for fasts and jiao rites, or the property of shrines and spirits. Some steal from their parents, children, or kin, or extort wealth through coercion. Others deceive through official matters, or forcibly seize property without just cause. Some employ deceit or false pretenses, or refuse to repay loans out of greed. Others exploit the ignorant, or bully and humiliate others to take their wealth. From the moment a single thought of theft arises, regardless of the amount, boundless sins accumulate unseen within, never brought to light. Today, as they burn incense and prostrate in repentance, may all their transgressions be washed away.\"\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Venerable again addressed the attendant Perfected Ones at his side, saying: \"I observe the multitudes of the lower realms, amassing wealth like mountains, yet their hearts are never satisfied. Insatiable in greed, they scheme and contrive, toiling in body and mind, utterly devoid of benevolence. They live in the world with avaricious hearts, cutting and scraping. Some behold the Celestial Venerable or the stars and conceive miserly greed. Others see sacred temples or scriptures and do the same. Some encounter Daoist masters or Dharma teachers and grow stingy. Others see their parents or children and hoard their wealth. Some witness the poor, the orphaned, or the elderly and feel no pity. Others see the dying, the maimed, or the disabled and remain unmoved. Some observe prisoners in shackles or those in famine and feel no compassion. Others see travelers in distress, or those in water or fire emergencies, and turn away. Some exploit servants or laborers, yet refuse to give alms. They withhold offerings from the Celestial Venerable and stellar altars, from scriptures and registers, from fasts and jiao rites, from the copying of scriptures or the creation of images, from virtuous Dharma masters, from the poor and orphaned, from prisoners in shackles, from the sick and suffering, from those in water or fire emergencies, from travelers in dire need, or from those starving in famine.\n\nA person lives for a day, yet plans for a hundred years. Born with not a single coin, they depart with not a single coin. At death, all is emptiness. How foolish to cling to miserliness and greed, devoid of compassion! At the moment of death, their treasures, mansions, storehouses, estates, and lands all pass to others. Their wives and children weep, their kin scatter—what benefit remains? In life, they accumulate karma, each deed bearing its retribution, too dreadful to recount.\n\nI further see the multitudes of the lower realms, who daily amass sins, their hearts entangled in greed and malice, cutting and scraping from the orphaned and poor without a shred of pity. Some stand before sacred images of the Celestial Venerable and conceive anger. Others do so before temples and scriptures, or upon seeing ordained Daoists.\"",

Some grow enraged upon seeing temple spirits or deities. Some grow enraged upon seeing the old, the sick, the orphaned, or the poor. Some grow enraged upon seeing prisoners in their cells. Some grow enraged upon seeing the dying in dire straits. Some grow enraged upon seeing floods, fires, or calamities. Some grow enraged upon seeing famine and starvation. Some grow enraged upon seeing slaves or laborers. Some grow enraged upon seeing the destitute begging. Some grow enraged upon seeing oxen, horses, or the six livestock. Such karmic impulses of the heart are measureless and boundless. In all their conduct and bearing, in every thought and intention, they lack all mercy and forbearance. Today, they prostrate themselves in repentance, beseeching the erasure of all these transgressions.\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao says: I observe the multitudes of the lower realms, who conduct themselves in the world with the six senses benighted, utterly devoid of even a shred of goodness. Some, before sacred images of the Celestial Venerable, act in utter folly. Some, before the stars and the Great Dao, act in utter folly. Some, before Daoist temples and sacred altars, act in utter folly. Some, in the midst of scripture recitations and Daoist rites, act in utter folly. Some, upon seeing ordained Daoists, act in utter folly. Some, upon seeing the sages of the empty sky, act in utter folly. Some, before their parents, wives, or children, act in utter folly. Some, before Heaven and Earth, the sun, the moon, and the stars, act in utter folly. Some curse Heaven and Earth, or revile and imprecate spirits and deities. Some rebel against their lords and fathers, or fail in filial piety to their ancestors. Some turn misfortune into disaster, establish laws that disrupt the natural order, commit incest with their kin, or murder others. They disbelieve in the karmic conditions of sin and blessing, in the retributions of past lives, claiming themselves eternal, neither born nor perishing, unable to distinguish good from evil, or the wise from the foolish. Such folly is unbearable to witness.\n\nAll the Perfected Ones now burn incense and prostrate themselves in homage before the Golden Portal of the Celestial Emperor, vowing that from this day forth, for all beings in the lower realms, the three karmic deeds of body, heart, and speech shall be released. May they ever attain purity of the six senses, forever free from contention, ever cultivating hearts of gentleness, harmony, compassion, and love, hearts free from heedlessness and arrogance, free from greed and miserliness. May they ever cultivate hearts of joy, hearts that refrain from killing and protect life, hearts of filial piety, loyalty, and trust, hearts that relieve the poor and rescue the distressed, hearts that benefit all beings with generosity. Those who cultivate such hearts shall be guarded by the ten celestial deities of goodness, their worldly misfortunes forever dispelled, their sins and calamities scattered and destroyed. They shall be forever free from fear, received by immortals, and all shall attain deliverance.\n\nThe Primordial Lord of the Dao further addresses the Perfected Ones in attendance: From this day forth, if among the multitudes of the lower realms there are faithful followers of the Dao who, for all foolish beings burdened by sin and evil karma—including the winged and the crawling, the birds and beasts, and the six livestock—establish sacred altars, recite scriptures, perform repentance rites, light lamps, burn incense, prostrate themselves, and present memorials to the heavens, earnestly and without ceasing offering rites of thanksgiving to Heaven and Earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the Five Peaks, the Four Waterways, and the officials of Fengdu’s netherworld, then I shall dispatch the Most High Lord of Salvation from Suffering. From the Azure Repository within the Northern Numinous Purple Pavilion, he shall bring forth the Jade Tablets of Golden Script bearing the august names of the Celestial Venerable. Chanting and extolling the sacred hymns, contemplating the true and invoking the Dao, he shall beseech the erasure of their names from the Jade Archives of the Nine Dark Realms and the Bureaus of the Celestial Officials. Thus shall the Five Sufferings be absolved and the Three Wretched Paths released. The feathered and furred shall be freed from their sins, all attaining deliverance, returning to the human realm, no longer mired in suffering, forever dwelling in carefree ease, their wishes fulfilled.\n\nTherefore, burn incense, surrender body and life, prostrate yourselves with the five limbs touching the earth.
