On the third day of the seventh month, I was granted an audience and offered a seat. The Emperor inquired about the *Scripture of Purity and Tranquility*, and I expounded upon it. He then asked about the northern campaign, to which I replied: \"It shall cease in the *wu-wu* year.\" This later proved true. Next, he questioned me on the Quanzhen lineage, and I answered each query in turn. The Emperor expressed deep admiration and detained me until dusk before I was permitted to leave. The following day, I was bestowed a purple robe and the title *Master of Embodied Mystery*. A close attendant was dispatched to convey the imperial decree, granting me Chongfu and Xiuzhen Abbeys to reside in as I pleased, along with a monthly allowance of two hundred strings of cash for vegetarian meals. While staying at Xiuzhen Abbey, I composed this poem to send to my aged mother and the Daoist community of Sacred Waters.\n\nBeneath Xiuzhen Abbey, messages flow unimpeded,\nAs auspicious light shuttles through the azure sky.\nOnce I met a radiant master who revealed the true teaching;\nNow I receive the sagely Emperor’s aid in spreading the mystic wind.\nFrom this day, Yuyang shall guide transformation,\nAnd the Dharma assembly shall henceforth cultivate with diligence.\nI bow to my compassionate mother—cast aside all worry,\nFor the imperial grace has not yet permitted my return home.\n\n**For the Wife of the Surveillance Commissioner, Seeking Healing from Illness**\n\nHeaven-born, Heaven-long, in accord with Heaven’s cultivation,\nNo matter the dusty world or the bones of the vulgar.\nHow could the four impermanent states approach the Phoenix Terrace?\nHow could the three corpses reach the isles of Yingzhou?\nAwakening to truth, the inner light forgets new afflictions;\nGrasping the root, the heart turns to ash, dispelling old sorrows.\nThe colorless true emptiness transcends the other shore,\nSteadily riding the boundless great divine vessel.\n\n**Presented to Lü, Abbot of Zu’an Abbey**\n\nGreat awakening’s majestic light illumines the vast sky,\nThe true auspice of prior Heaven arrives in haste.\nThe void and pure, serene and still, endure through past and present;\nThe supreme Dao flows forth, rightly transmitted by the ancestral masters.\nThe three realms and ten directions are all of one accord,\nThe thousand scriptures and myriad discourses—inexhaustible in their profundity.\nForgetting emotion, the Lord of Heavenly Origin manifests,\nEmerging from within the transformations of yin and yang.\n\n**Presented to the Abbess of Weizhou Abbey**\n\nWho has encountered a living immortal?\nTruly nurturing numinous clarity, piercing the azure heavens.\nFrom the jade treasury, true water and fire are drawn and replenished;\nIn the jasper palace, auspicious clouds and mist congeal.\nForm and spirit both wondrous—who can comprehend?\nEmptiness and form wholly dissolved—how can the principle be conveyed?\nThe four seas turn their light inward, all revering the teaching;\nNaturally, merit and virtue fill the three thousand realms.\n\n**Two Poems Presented to the Daoist Community for Their Support**\n\nDeep gratitude to our lineage for its vast support,\nSteadfast and unwavering in diligent refinement.\nPreserving the spirit in silence, dust remains unstained;\nCultivating qi in continuity, the Dao is natural.\nRevealing the original source, the pure and tranquil Lord;\nTransforming and generating the mystic image, the embryonic immortal dances.\nThe revolving jade pivot governs the true Three Treasures,\nImmovable, the light of compassion fills the great thousandfold world.\n\nUpholding the Dao in poverty, the Dao is nameless,\nAll depends on the human heart’s sincere resolve.\nOne qi circulates, purifying the cosmos;\nThe three luminaries converge, gathering the numinous.\nAuspicious omens at the jade altar conceal the immortal’s traces;\nPropitious radiance from the precious tripod veils transformation and birth.\nUttering the true oral formula of the inner elixir,\nWondrous workings dance and abide, spontaneously perfected.\n\n**[Ode to Yuqing Abbey]**\n\nThe master’s former retreat—Zhuyan’s northern Yuqing Abbey,\nCalled \"Little Sacred Waters,\" truly a place of excellence.\nThus, this poem.\n\nThis cliff’s sacred site is rare through past and present;\nLeisurely pacing through mist and rosy clouds, the daylight lingers.\nThe sages of the three realms cast their regard;\nThe Dao and virtue of this land are wholly refined.\nPair upon pair of youths bear flowered staves;\nCouple after couple of auspicious simurghs dance upon the jade steps.\nSoon, the great elixir shall be completed and I shall return;\nWith those of karmic affinity, I shall accompany them to the Jasper Pool.\n\n**For Clerk Wang of Fushan, Seeking Instruction Due to Illness**\n\nGently, subtly nurturing harmony,\nSilently cultivating the heart, emerging from the river of desire.\nAugmenting the Valley Spirit, ever unceasing;\nTransmitting the blood and pulse, forever free from ailment.\nRealizing the true and emitting the Dao, forgetting birth and death;\nPerceiving nature and penetrating the numinous, severing demonic obstructions.\nAge after age, it is due to upright merit and virtue;\nThe myriad spirits all bear one aloft from the world of suffering.\n\n**For Attendant Wu, Staying Through Summer**\n\nWell met, sharing this place to seek coolness,\nGathering the numinous cinnabar, its fragrance beyond the heavens.\nThe four great elements return, the qi pure and temperate;\nThe twin springs irrigate, the jade countenance radiant.\nRegulating the spirit, immovable—misfortune becomes blessing;\nEncountering things without partiality—yin reverts to yang.\nAnother livelihood, idly passing the days,\nUnfurling the precious scriptures, perusing two or three lines.\n\n**Two Poems on Escaping the World’s Net**\n\nAccord with Heaven’s merit and virtue, transforming and arising,\nThe Dharma-body’s luminosity pervades the nine realms.\nThe wisdom-eye, limpid and clear, without the slightest attachment;\nThe spirit-pearl, bright and resplendent, utterly free from dust.\nThe five directions’ numinous radiance soars heavenward;\nA single blossom of the heart brushes the sun, unfolding.\nThe true visage through the vast kalpa appears anew;\nOnly then does one know that everywhere is Penglai.\n\nFreed from the world’s net, no entanglements remain;\nThe elixir already perfected, the Dao is natural.\nFrom the Purple Palace, jade snow flutters;\nFrom the Jasper Terrace, golden lotuses gradually bloom.\nThe palaces of the spirit, segment by segment, perfectly coalesce;\nThe Dharma-nature, empty and vast, shines in full illumination.\nWithin and without, the golden-jade body is refined;\nAll because of a single encounter with a Great Luo Immortal.\n\n**Two Poems on Rustic Aspirations**\n\nFor decades, muddled wine and wild song,\nA body unburdened, roaming in dreams as an immortal.\nPreserving the heart to save and deliver across the three realms;\nThe entire being luminous, piercing the nine heavens.\nA life beyond the world—only I understand;\nThe treasures within the gourd—who pities them?\nThe Jade Yang Master of the eastern cloud-sea,\nDelivers the foolish and deluded, never transmitting in vain.\n\nI shall open and transform, blending the three yangs,\nLayer upon layer of mist and rosy clouds filling the ten directions.\nRefining the precious pearl, containing the Dharma-realm;\nTransforming and generating numinous radiance, reaching the vault of heaven.\nTiger and dragon coil around the golden tripod;\nSun and moon soar, illuminating the jade hall.\nBy the time I ride the simurgh back to the Purple Palace,\nIn the realm of Great Peace, I shall harmonize with the light.\n\n**Two Poems in Response to Disciple Zhang Zhiming’s Inquiry on Daily Practice**\n\nHark! Seeking the true amidst the false, like carving and polishing,\nEmbodying Heaven and modeling the Dao, nurturing harmony.\nWithin the shadows of the three luminaries, the heart-seal is grasped;\nAmidst the gates of the myriad Dharmas, the honey of awakening is savored.\nTwo paths of pure wind penetrate the Purple Palace;\nThe six heavens’ will emerges from the world of suffering.\nThe non-existent and existent form a perfect sphere;\nSoon, one shall ascend to the Great Luo.\n\nThe jade nature gleams, illuminating the clear sky,\nOriginally non-action, summoning fortune and wisdom.\nThe mysterious principle flows freely, truly at ease;\nThe wondrous light, limpid and clear, roams at will.\nA single note of celestial music ascends the golden palace;\nTwo streams of numinous spring irrigate the auspicious sprout.\n\nRecognize the original true face, rely on the master and become the bridge for saving others.\nThe principle of causes and conditions—\nMeeting the master breaks open good affinities,\nImpartial toward all things, in harmony with Heaven above.\nFivefold radiance gathers in the wisdom-nature,\nMyriad hues of rosy clouds cluster in the cinnabar field.\nA pure tone beyond the void conveys the true essence,\nAmidst the waves of the bitter sea, the Dharma-boat plies.\nNo certification, no cultivation—truly complete,\nThe original merit and practice are naturally perfect.\n\nDwelling in dust yet unstained—\nVacuity congeals into elegance, forming the numinous embryo,\nThough in the world of dust, the Dao-eye opens.\nWine, lust, anger, wealth—others’ livelihoods,\nYet spirit and blood-vessels root in the self.\nLet the primordial sea dwell together,\nAs Kunlun’s heights freely traverse to and fro.\nThis cause and condition is truly certain,\nNon-action and purity reach Penglai.\n\nTwo Self-Chants\n\nEastern clouds and seas, a gentle breeze,\nAll day in non-action, speaking of suffering and emptiness.\nA single point of perfect clarity, truly complete,\nTwice encountered, the nature melts in fusion.\nThe three fields forge the elixir of longevity,\nNine years’ cultivation perfects transcendent merit.\nOften gazing toward the celestial path of primordial dawn,\nThe light of Perfect Realization illumines the Great Luo Palace.\n\nLead and mercury merge to form the Great Elixir,\nConsumed, one instantly regains youthful countenance.\nThe physical body harmonizes yin and yang’s reckoning,\nThe true nature transcends life and death’s barrier.\nThe eight meridians flow with the sea of primordial qi,\nMyriad spirits gather on Jade Capital Mountain.\nRevolving and repeating, arrayed anew,\nThe Heavenly Perfected of the Limitless freely come and go.\n\nTwo Instructions for Disciples\n\nEspecially for fellow travelers, pointing to superior affinity,\nFrom beginning to end, the will remains steadfast.\nIn quietude, subtly aiding the truly real,\nIn warmth and fullness, all affairs must be relinquished.\nFurther, act sincerely among people,\nLike the evergreen lotus in fire.\nClouds and rosy clouds guide steps toward the primordial,\nWhen merit is complete, the three thousand and great thousand worlds are attained.\n\nAll the lofty and wise together form affinity,\nIn the depths of the bitter sea, golden lotuses are planted.\nEmerging from dust, fragrant and resplendent, free from all filth,\nIlluminating the body, radiance shines upon the nine heavens.\nFrom the outset, the true Dao-eye is revealed,\nCultivating the supreme Perfected of the Great Luo.\nTranscending past and present, the true numinous nature,\nComplete and clear, not a single Dharma is transmitted.\n\nThe Immortal Realm\n\nThe immortal realm, towering and inscrutable to the world,\nFilled with rare fragrances and jade dust.\nRainbow banners and crimson tassels pay homage at the golden palace,\nFeathered canopies and cloud flags reflect upon jeweled terraces.\nThe sagely Perfected of the three realms gather in assembly,\nThe youths of the five directions linger in long reverie.\nUnchanged through ancient and modern times—who can perceive it?\nOnly those with the Dao-eye opened through spiritual communion.\n\nPerfect Realization\n\nMy master propagated the Dao, establishing Perfect Realization,\nFirst encountering Pure Yang, receiving the secret texts.\nThe nature fills the void, congealing luminous brilliance,\nThe elixir perfected, inside and out, auspicious clouds form.\nInstantly transcending the Dharma-realm, leaving the mysterious teaching,\nTransforming humans and heavens, praising the sagely sovereign.\nDelivering all beings from myriad sufferings,\nNaturally, the world and seas universally know and hear.\n\nEncountering the Master’s Transmission\n\nI once encountered a living immortal,\nNurturing numinous clarity, piercing the azure sky.\nThe heart enters the crimson palace, obscurely illuminating,\nQi exhales into the cinnabar furnace, naturally revolving.\nForm and spirit both wondrous, locked in mist and rosy clouds,\nMovement and stillness both forgotten, nature and life complete.\nUniversally wishing the world to comprehend this principle,\nAll at once, together boarding the boat for saving others.\n\nTwo Gifts for Fellow Daoists\n\nIn pure poverty and gentle weakness, the face delights in redness,\nThe original nature, carefree, yearns for the orthodox lineage.\nFurther wishing to gather the spirit, investing within,\nThen abandoning the false, awakening to true emptiness.\nThe numinous source firmly secured, without any leaks,\nThe divine sword brandished, slaying the nine worms.\nRefining cinnabar to perfection, understanding the fire’s timing,\nSitting and watching the crow and hare, freely east and west.\n\nHeaven’s harmony, earth’s principle, and human peace,\nThe three teachings and three talents are all the same.\nThe nature-candle’s light, ever bright and unwavering,\nThe numinous youth leaps in joyful pursuit.\nFloating clouds disperse, the zenith of meditation clears,\nExternal affairs embraced, the sea of awakening widens.\nUnrestrained and carefree, observing self-so,\nThe original countenance forever beheld.\n\nAnswering a Question on the Method of Peace and Bliss\n\nThe great Dao of vacuity, the secret of Perfect Realization,\nSurpassing wealth for the nation and peace for the people.\nLiberating the numinous palace, myriad transformations arise,\nThe harmonious sea of qi dispels a thousand ailments.\nStability transcends the great leakless divine boat,\nRolling forth into the autumn night’s moonlit sky.\nThe nature, perfectly bright, the Dao naturally completes,\nRevolving and repeating, arrayed anew.\n\nFor the Newly Departed from the Household\n\nTurning the head to seek the path to the Eternal Capital,\nInternally and externally, completely empty, sweeping the heart.\nUtterly exhausting schemes, reaching the profound and obscure,\nDrawing and adding water and fire, illuminating inversion.\nRefining the four images and three talents,\nExpelling the seven emotions and six wastes.\nA single nature, radiant, illumines the great void,\nOn Jade Capital, naturally, the golden scripture reports.\n\nTwo Instructions for Disciples on Proofreading Merit and Practice\n\nExhorting and transforming, the will in affinity remains firm,\nExerting the heart, all are as I am.\nThe golden pass unlocks, the mysterious wind penetrates,\nThe iron tree blooms, the great Dao is transmitted.\nSubduing the myriad spirits, all rejoice,\nReporting through three lifetimes, free from calamity and transgression.\nThe friends of the ten directions should seek and obtain,\nAwakening to true emptiness, all become immortals.\n\nA naturally singular realm, truly vast,\nAccordant with the principle of the subtle and obscure.\nNurturing the nameless, pure and tranquil body,\nTransforming without destruction, the profound and obscure lineage.\nBanners and streamers, flashing, arrayed in the cloudy Han,\nJade girdle pendants, tinkling, descend from the great void.\nReceiving and guiding, perfectly bright, truly complete,\nThe Dharma-wheel constantly turns, circulating the mysterious wind.\n\nTwo Poems on Creation and Transformation\n\nWondrous practice and true merit, complete in ten years,\nUniversally uniting with the Dharma-Dao, refining true immortals.\nGently, the lead furnace’s divine light bursts forth,\nVividly, the numinous cinnabar’s fire timing is complete.\nThe twofold mysterious wind penetrates the mountain’s peak,\nA single stream of cold jade descends upon the mushroom field.\nSplitting open chaos to observe the limitless,\nExpansively, the numinous root nurtures the vast and unconstrained.\n\nPreserving the body, pure and elegant, tiger and dragon roar,\nSilently, true compassion turns through ancient and modern times.\nThe Supreme Ultimate’s original lineage opens creation and transformation,\nFrom the outset, the mysterious image flows in ascent and descent.\nThe spirit gathers the five viscera, evil cannot enter,\nThe nature extinguishes the three corpses, the Dao naturally seeks itself.\nAfter a single great elixir ripens,\nThe precious flower, perfectly round, emerges from the jade peak.\n\nDharma Kin\n\nOn Jade Capital, the immortal kin, my heart’s fellowship,\nFortune bestowed, prosperity flourishes, misfortune does not befall.\nHell transforms into a hall for transmitting the Dao,\nThe fire pit becomes a bridge for delivering immortals.\nLeisurely listening to the Dharma-drum resounding on the numinous peak,\nThen readying the cloud chariot, sailing the purple empyrean.\n\nThe Primordial Beginning sheds its radiance to broadly deliver salvation,\nThe Chaos-Origin wanders freely through the Three Realms in carefree ease.\n\n**Preface**\nAhead, the purple phoenix dances in cloud-light,\nBehind, the azure simurgh leads the way to the Emperor’s realm.\nThe Seven Treasures’ Grotto-Heaven is ever unclouded by night,\nThe Ninefold Purity’s rites and methods spread universally.\nThe Five Phases and Four Images clearly harmonize in prosperity,\nThrough ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives, calamities are extinguished.\nTwo substances merge to form the flawless body,\nOne numinous true nature reaches the vault of heaven.\n\n**Leaving the Dust**\nLeaping from the wheel of rebirth to enter the Dao,\nProfound mechanisms silently fill the breast.\nSuddenly transcending all inner and outer dust-nets,\nNever falling among the cliffs of myriad sufferings.\nA single point of spirit-light, without lack or leakage,\nThe four false things may sink and bury themselves.\nOne day, riding a crane to ascend to the Origin,\nReturning once more to the Heavenly Palace, treading the jade steps.\n\n**Bestowed upon the Commander of Yidu**\nOriginally but a single point of true void,\nDescending to the Middle Kingdom to become a worthy minister.\nMight extended to distant frontiers, boundless affairs,\nLoyalty aiding the pure court, employing utmost benevolence.\nNot apart from the Jade Yang’s joyous

ground,\nWhere the original merit and virtue naturally perfect themselves.\n\n**To Younger Brother Sui on Cultivation**\nPurify body and mind, nurturing qi and spirit,\nRefining metal and jade, emerging from the sea of delusion.\nIn the three fields, secretly plant the medicine of years,\nOne day joyfully encountering the deathless person.\nFive-way heavenly light, shining and sparkling,\nSix-yang earthly qi, issuing and circulating.\nSteaming and permeating joints, penetrating flesh and bone,\nCertainly attending the Primordial, paying homage to the Purple Imperial Court.\n\n**To Erlang, Who Withdrew from the Dao**\nAt first entering my gate, all admired,\nWho knew you lacked the share to become a true friend.\nThe azure empyrean’s path is distant, the years near,\nThe black ledger’s name high, hell’s depths profound.\nFan Li and Zhang Liang are not easily learned,\nCauldron’s boiling soup and sword trees are not hard to find.\nIn the future, you will suffer merciless pain,\nRegretting your mad and reckless heart.\n\n**Lu Xuanwu Inquires of the Dao**\nA single qi’s ascent and descent merges the great elixir,\nOnly then knowing the numinous treasure naturally returns.\nGathering and storing the precious jade, returning to the central position,\nPicking and stirring heaven’s mechanism, infusing the inner visage.\nLight bursts from the nine palaces, observing the world,\nWith the Dao’s completion, eternally ranked among immortals.\nRiding a green simurgh, steadily soaring into empty space,\nHenceforth, your pure standard will guard the sea and mountains.\n\n**To the Diviner**\nExhaustively investigating heaven’s principles, most distinct,\nEspecially to resolve the world’s difficulties.\nDiscerning yin and yang’s timely prosperity and decline,\nAble to comprehend the sun and moon’s waxing and waning.\nFollowing the nine luminaries’ course, calamities befall,\nReversing the three yangs’ changes, misfortune does not invade.\nDo

love,\nBrandishing the sharp sword to cleave the mountain of affection.\nIn Penglai and Langyuan’s immortal realms,\nWith a single thought of heart’s ashes, all may be scaled.\n\n**To Disciple Nanlü Ge**\nSearch the root-source of kalpas past,\nKnow this as the fine cause and reason.\nA thousand auspicious hues gather in the cinnabar valley,\nTen thousand streams of silver mist flow against the

majestic light clusters the Ten Isles.\n\n**To Ren Ge of Sizhou Inquiring on the Great Matter of Nature and Life**\nThe harmonious union of nature and life is not difficult,\nWhen karmic obstructions

elixir must coalesce,\nShattering emptiness, the nature is naturally at ease.\nA single spark of numinous light transcends creation,\nThe cloud chariot bears it to Jade Capital Mountain.\n\n**To Xu Shangya of Putai County**\nThe four great elements of the body are but empty float,\nBorrowing the false to cultivate the true holds another reason.\nThe supreme Dao, subtle and imperceptible, knows no extinction,\nThe original spirit, untrammeled, does not linger.\nThe gentle lead crucible bursts with golden light,\nThe tranquil spirit palace gathers jade flames.\nA master stands before you,\nMeeting, you clap hands and laugh without end.\n\n**Instructions to Disciples**\nIn emptiness and purity, establish the golden altar,\nSweep aside the wheel of rebirth and the gate of life and death.\nEmotions and nature harmonize like still water,\nQi and spirit intertwine like a returning ring.\nThe luminous pearl shines beyond the clouds,\nThe crane’s chariot drifts lightly beyond the world.\nUntil reaching the Great Luo Heaven’s realm,\nReturn in due time to restore your true countenance.\n\n**To Sun Si of Changjian, Laiyang**\nA letter sent to the worthy Sun Si,\nGently refining

lotuses.\nSeven emotions extinguished, perfect clarity gathers,\nEight Grotto Immortals together receive the decree.\nNine-curved luminous pearl threads through the crown,\nTen-directional worlds freely traversed.\n\n**Sea Market Poem with Preface**\nTemporarily parting from Dongmou, I journeyed west to Deng Prefecture, gradually approaching the ancient Huang Xigao. There, I witnessed the sea market’s suspended radiance manifesting marvels—truly in accord with the Dao.\nThus it is said: Heaven and Earth release their essence, the great Dao unfolds. Donning the Three Lights, it descends; receiving the primordial qi, it ascends. Myriad transformations arise among humankind, yet none know its way.\nIt nurtures all heavens, the earth’s harmonious balance. Through the four seasons’ heat and cold, it illumines the vast firmament, giving birth to mysterious images. Merging with the root-source of the ten thousand dharmas, it aligns with the eyes and vision of the Great Luo.\nHence, borrowing Su Dongpo’s rhyme to express my feelings.\n\nCrystal palaces lock the clear sky,\nMyriad forms limpid within the azure sea.\n\nWithin the moon, the Lady Heng gazes into her jeweled mirror;\nAmid the sun, the Immortal Child plays in the Pearl Palace.\nHeaven and Earth revolve, revealing the luminous truth,\nAs primal chaos reopens, surpassing all craftsmanship.\n\nTen thousand rays of fine light gather round the Kan tiger;\nA thousand strands of crimson qi envelop the Li dragon.\nAcross the sky, the sacred host upholds the circular canopy—\nJade maidens and golden lads attend the Master.\n\nWhere purple mists and rosy clouds just unfurl,\nThe intricate Seven Treasures display their majesty.\nA divine wind, silent yet startling mountain spirits,\nMyriad transformations intermingle—none in the world can fathom.\n\nLight overwhelms water and sky, leaving no force to resist;\nMy true self, through the Three Realms, attains harmony.\nWith mind released, the world knows no hindrance—\nAcross the Four Great Continents, how many cups are drunk?\n\nThough Su Dongpo was a true superior man,\nOne must know that great stillness surpasses the Yuanfeng era.\nAll the heroes of past and present, those who \"hook the giant turtle,\"\nCare not for mud, sand, or shattered iron and bronze.\n\nBy cultivating the Dao to govern the body, with merits complete,\nOne joins the family style of the Great Luo Heaven.\n\nFollowing the previous rhyme:\n\nThe Primal Three Realms look down upon the empty void,\nWhere hidden, in vast seas, rise immortal mountains.\nHarmonious qi flows forth, birthing auspicious images;\nPure winds and bright moon penetrate the numinous palace.\n\nHeavenly boys and heavenly maidens arise from emptiness;\nCrimson towers and jade pavilions transcend mortal craft.\nWithin surging waves, the jade tiger is born;\nAmid raging flames, the vermilion dragon races.\n\nThe Lord of the Mud Pill Palace drums the heavens;\nThe Perfected of the Purple Court dance as drunken elders.\nGathered, the myriad spirits celebrate in unison,\nSoaring through the Eight Directions to display their purity and power.\n\nThey wield the divine elixir that parts past and present,\nSplitting the void—yet the principle knows no end.\nEternally transcending creation, achieving long life,\nLuminous, formless, they attain perfect harmony.\n\nThus, for a hundred generations, they ascend to the celestial river,\nReceiving boundless grace beyond ten thousand cups.\nAiding the unfolding of the Mystery Gate, upholding the Inner Teaching,\nIn this pure age, they delight in true abundance.\n\nThe immortal embryo and Dao bones dwell in the dusty realm,\nLike fine gold mingled with tin and bronze.\nOnly when the Purple Writ personally summons,\nWill our family style at last be revealed.\n\n[Seven-character quatrain]\nAbiding in the Dao...\n\nThe golden essence and jade marrow form the immortal embryo,\nAlong the spine, two luminous paths unfold.\nThe crown is bathed in ambrosia, giving rise to ten thousand phenomena,\nAs the sun and moon’s twin beams irradiate the jade terrace.\n\nSubtly enduring, ever-present—\nRecognize the dynamic stillness of emptiness and non-being,\nThe flowing essence and precious jade bestow boundless rewards.\nRevolving endlessly, arrayed anew,\nThe immortal’s melody resounds through the vast heavens.\n\nReturn to simplicity, embrace humility—\nThe root source, free from leakage, ensures eternal life,\nA thousand-petaled golden lotus gleams with the sun’s brilliance.\nHeart and nature, clearly understood as one,\nThe Great Dao of mystery and tranquility naturally achieves perfection.\n\nThe gentle lead crucible—\nA single qi, pure and void, gathers the myriad spirits,\nAll spirits converge to behold perfect clarity.\nWithin and without, celestial radiance coalesces,\nSealing the proof of Penglai, transcending life and death.\n\nLight pierces the eaves and curtains—\nPure Yang ascends, transforming and soaring to the heavens,\nReleasing divine light to nourish the auspicious lotus.\nThe Dao’s qi circulates through midnight and noon,\nOsmanthus flowers blaze with boundless illumination.\n\nCreation’s forces contend—\nBetween the twin kidneys, wind and rain roar,\nDragon and tiger race as the crow and hare flee.\nThe elixir pellet enters the abdomen, startling gods and ghosts,\nThe earth’s demons and grasses all bow in submission.\n\nDragon and tiger unite—\nFive-colored celestial light reveals its true form,\nThe void and non-being operate in profound obscurity.\nWhere Jade Yang arrives, immortal songs resound,\nGolden lotuses step forth, shimmering across the heavens.\n\nClear and turbid divide—\nFollowing the qi’s flow, behold self-mastery,\nEmbracing the wind’s song in drunken harmony.\nWithin the realm of cool purity, divine light blazes,\nGradually turning toward the void, the Great Dao opens.\n\n**Duke Wang asks how to study the Dao and transcend life and death**\nThe primordial qi of emptiness congeals the divine elixir,\nUnlocking the gate of rebirth and the cycle of life and death.\nDelivering the ten directions from the Three Realms’ suffering,\nThe true nature of the single spirit returns of itself.\n\n**He further asks how to embody Heaven and follow the Dao**\nThe Great Dao does not depart from the process of transformation,\nSwift as thunder, yet effortless in its natural workings.\nPursuing this principle reveals all as one body,\nResponding to the worlds of humans and heavens without fail.\n\n**Bestowed upon disciple Wang Ge**\nShatter the mountain of self and others in cultivation,\nTranscend the mundane, cut off all going and returning.\nMaintain impartiality, ever upright in heart,\nOne day you shall ascend to the azure heavens.\n\n**Zhang Gong inquires about sudden enlightenment**\nThe Dao is empty, formless, without a single thing,\nYet it responds to conditions, delivering all beings.\nReuniting with the Lord of Heaven’s Primordial Kalpa,\nAll ten thousand cycles of rebirth are instantly understood.\n\n**Wandering**\nLeisurely observing mountains and waters, roaming Peng Isle,\nWhite clouds blanket the earth, the wind sweeps of itself.\nQuietly reflecting on the toil of fleeting life,\nWho can cultivate this path to escape decay and aging?\n\n**Attaining the Elixir**\nThe crow flies, the hare flees into the center,\nIn the dim and wondrous source, the wondrous method is found.\nA single grain of the elixir pellet completes the nine transformations,\nAscending and transforming to fill the vault of heaven.\n\n**Awakening to Truth**\nAwakening brings earnest joy in true recognition,\nThe crown bathed in ambrosia, the qi expands.\nThe Great Dao’s harmony flows through midnight and noon,\nThe inner divine light rolls forth from the mud pill.\n\n**Pursuing the Dao**\nClear and turbid rise and fall, ever returning,\nDrowsy and silent, words fail to express.\nThe twin eyes need not gaze upon the celestial patterns,\nEars and nose, spiritually attuned, absorb the essence of the embryo.\n\n**Following Transformation**\nUpside-down and cyclical, like a drunken man,\nNeither sorrow nor joy, the inner truth remains whole.\nWhere spirit and energy move, divine waves surge,\nThe Three Realms are pure and void, free from specks of dust.\n\n**Returning to Truth**\nPenetrating the root source, a single point runs deep,\nThe spirit terrace nurtures the golden lingzhi.\nGolden light surges, transcending life and death,\nThe jade nature shines, illuminating past and present.\n\n**Saving Lives**\nTo save the empty body from great calamity,\nThe cycles of rebirth and death cannot contain it.\nThe divine spring’s sacred water flows through the mysterious valley,\nThe four seasons’ immortal flowers bloom within fire.\n\n**Nurturing the Dao**\nLong ago at the Eastern Sea, I first met the true,\nGrateful for your guidance and care, O enlightened lord.\nNow I await the Purple Edict to return to the immortal capital,\nTurning the jade door’s lock to enter the golden gate.\n\n**Transmitting Goodness**\nWhen merit is complete and conduct perfected, ascend to the origin,\nDo not overstep the pure age to forge bonds with all.\nMay the deluded universally return to the Supreme Dao,\nAiding in the cultivation of true blessings without end.\n\n**Illuminating Radiance**\nAll stand at Danyang’s miraculous stele,\nThe immortal’s traces, wondrous and mighty.\nEncompassing the subtle and profound, surpassing past and present,\nMending the mechanisms of creation’s primordial workings.\n\n**Attaining the Root**\nWith an empty heart and full belly, intent focused,\nSeize the horse and capture the ape to seek the enlightened immortal.\nPractice the Great Dao in purity and non-action,\nNo need to earnestly inquire of the azure heavens.\n\n**Recognizing Taboos**\nThroughout the twelve hours, the child of good and evil records,\nTranscribing names and deeds to present to Heaven’s Lord.\nAssessing merit and conduct without flaw,\nThe immortal ranks are surely attained without fail.\n\n**Female Daoist Liu Zhimiao of Huang County asks about daily practice**\nDiligently investigate daily practice with keen effort,\nEvery glance turned inward perfects a hundred deeds.\nRefining the self, forging truth to magnify the Great Dao,\nThe path ahead will naturally extinguish all transgressions.\n\n**The Four Assemblies Open and Transform**\nThe seven-jeweled golden lotus exudes auspicious qi,\nJade splendor and impartiality are our family’s style.\nThe Three Pure Lords communicate true virtue,\nA single stream of radiance shines everywhere alike.\n\n**In Reply to the Summons from the Seven Treasures Assembly of Wendeng**\nDeeply honored by your summons to build bridges,\nDiscoursing on the method of birthlessness and deathlessness.\nThe seven-jeweled golden lotus blooms in unison,\nThe celestial assemblies’ fragrance fills the empty sky.\n\n**Mr. Liu Seeks

the Jade Field,\nGather the spirit in one thrust to pass the Three Passes.\n\n**The Assembly of the Golden Lotus Seeks Instruction**\nThe Dharma assembly arises from the Dao’s nature,\nPlanting golden lotuses in the depths of the bitter sea.\nThe gentle lead crucible’s divine light bursts forth,\nRolling out cinnabar to irradiate the azure heavens.\n\n**Returning to Harmony**\nReturn to the root, restore the origin, and reach the natural,\nThe void and purity transform into golden lotuses.\nFusing the Four Great Elements, the heart’s elixir forms,\nTen thousand rays of rosy light emerge from the grotto-heaven.\n\n**Comprehending Truth**\nFrom within the golden treasury, turn the body to emerge,\nA single point opens the jade splendor of Yao Pond.\nWind and moon drift beyond the heavens’ bounds,\nIn movement, stillness, sitting, and walking—this is Penglai.\n\n**Bestowed upon Liu Ku of Renshou, Fushan**\nThrough the ages, true compassion establishes great merit,\nOnly now, across the Three Heavens, does the encounter occur in haste.\nJoy and honor gradually reveal the profound mystery,\nAttaining this method, one knows the Dao’s unity.\n\n**[Sent to Master Danyang]**\nIn the fifteenth year of the Dading era, a disciple first vowed\nTo journey west to seek Master Danyang.\nThe master said: Why travel afar?\nOne day, we shall meet here.\nYet I cannot dismiss your resolve,\nSo I compose this quatrain to send to Master Danyang.\n\nUpon arriving there and unfolding to behold it, the words divulge celestial secrets—later, he indeed returned east.\n\n**In the East of Shandong Province, True Cultivation Abides**\nWood virtue neighbors, the hare frets in vain.\nOne-two-two-three linked as one-two,\nNine suns’ radiance brims, flowing eastward.\n\n**For the Daoist Community on Their Observances and Journeys**\nDaoist practice and immortal arts are sought within the heart,\nDo not drift with the waves, chasing the turning flow.\nEscape the bitter sea of love’s river,\nA single point of numinous light reaches the shore-bound boat.\n\n**For Chief Lian of Dengzhou, Who Requested a Eulogy on Filial Dao**\nHeaven and earth’s emptiness bears nurturing

In the *wuchen* year of the Dading era, I again met Master Chongyang, and so composed this lyric to record the truth:\n\nInnately endowed with the immortal embryo,\nAt seven, my hidden radiance merged with the great yang.\nMoved by the true traces of Eastern Florescence,\nDrifting through the void to bestow his regard,\nI awoke to the dream of the human world—\nThen once more met Chongyang.\nSecretly I knocked at the Mysterious Pass,\nAs he subtly expounded profound discourse,\nRefining the single yang with bright moon and clear wind.\nThe divine elixir congealed,\nContinuing the pivot of the celestial sphere,\nAscending in transformation to the pure yang.\n\nJoyfully I danced and bowed to Pure Yang,\nWith the wondrously empty Heavenly Master and True Yang.\nCommanded by

nature.**\n**Boundless blessings arise, witnessing the primordial origin—**\n**this time, fully enlightened, without cultivation or attainment.**\n\n---\n\n**To Liu Miaozhen for Alms-Gathering**\n\n**Universally transforming, alms-walking—**\n**heart clear, steps steady.**\n**On the path of penetrating the mystery, together we discuss and study.**\n**With sincere devotion, refining and smelting to extinguish ferocity,**\n**establishing great blessings to nourish and moisten.**\n\n**Delivering the benighted, opening the seal of the heart-mind.**\n**Parents of the ten directions all make their rounds to inquire.**\n**Having encountered the Complete Perfection in this life,**\n**the return is naturally guided by the immortals.**\n\n**To Wang Zhiming of Wendeng**\n\nEach one cultivates the true,\neveryone practices the Dao.\nThe subtle mechanism and wondrous principle must be sought.\nHour by hour, ever kindling the precious censer’s incense,\nday by day, always sweeping the field of the heart-mind.\nStep by step, cool and serene,\ndivine radiance overshadows.\nSages of the ten directions bestow grace in return.\nAmid piled purple clouds, the jade countenance shines—\nthe realm of everlasting spring knows no decay.\n\n**For Yan Yiweng of Dengzhou**\n\nQi harmonious and balanced,\nlight and brightness gathered.\nFor three days, above and below, jade-white essence flows.\nIn leisure, now and again, the elixir is sipped—\ngolden lead and jade mercury suddenly congeal.\nThe maiden and the youth,\ncloud companions and rosy friends,\nstep through emptiness, beyond birth and extinction.\nThe teaching spreads through the four seas, honoring the Complete Perfection—\nwhen merit is complete, a master comes to deliver.\n\n**To Han Yiweng of Dengzhou**\n\nPenglai at hand’s reach,\nthe three mountains in mutual resonance.\nGolden waves and jade billows roar and surge.\nEmerald light sways, touching the vault of heaven,\npure wind and bright moon envelop the stars.\nMyriad streams of silver toads,\nround luminosity converges.\nExquisite, the seven treasures form the true auspicious Dipper.\nIf one practices cultivation like this,\nthe great Dao of Primordial Origin is all accomplished.\n\n**Ode to the Stone Ganoderma of Tiecha Mountain**\n\nCloud-cream of the four seas,\nspiritual elegance of the three mountains.\nTo gather the ganoderma, one must befriend the formless.\nIt sates hunger and quenches thirst, nourishing the jade sprout,\naugmenting spirit and extending destiny, luminous and penetrating.\nPhoenixes soar,\ntigers and dragons contend.\nGolden lions and jade elephants roar and bellow.\nOnce carried to offer the perfected sages,\nif one consumes it, there is no aging or decay.\n\n**To the Daoist**\n\n**On the Virtues of the Daoist**\n\nBrick and tile in lofty conduct,\nthe alchemical furnace refines the wondrous nature.\nZither, chess, calligraphy, and painting adorn the imperial carriage.\nChisels, hammers, inked lines, and incense-sewn seams—\nall are invited to graft and cultivate the elixir.\nSwiftly tread the cloud-borne path,\ncrossing mountains, streams, and ridges.\nEver ponder the weighty Way of immortals,\ngazing beneath the Moon of the Western River toward Penglai,\nwhere in carefree joy the Perfected of the Complete Truth awaken.\n\n**Nine \"Xingxiangzi\"**\n\n**Meeting the Master**\nFor eight long years,\nI met Chongyang at last.\nMoved by true compassion, he shattered the king of my heart.\nIn clarity he guided, in stillness he weighed.\nI saw purple mist arise,\nauspicious winds arrive,\nclouds gather in the Cavern of Radiance.\n\nEmbracing the One without parting,\nresponding to things in roundness and square,\nhe summoned Dongmou—\nthe infant boy who attained the Dao.\nThe cinnabar ripened, the fruit filled,\nhe donned the rainbow robes.\nThen I beheld the Three Clarities,\npaid homage to the Jade Emperor,\nand universally offered incense.\n\n**To Little Hu of Binzhou**\nThere is a true formula—\nwho dares to undertake it?\nGathering mist and rosy clouds,\nfragrant and cool.\nThe dharma-body is filled,\nthe spirit-light replenished.\nThe root-source is settled,\nthe endurance of the unborn,\nreturning to blessed auspice.\n\nPrimordial qi is consumed as food,\nthirst slaked with rosy nectar.\nMerging with

heaven.\n\n**In Gratitude to the Assembly at the Sacred Water Feast**\nAlone I lean by the gate of Peng,\noffering incense in my journey.\nPraising emptiness and nothingness,\nthe cool clarity of virtue and Dao.\nPiercing gold and stone,\nmanifesting auspice beyond the void.\nThen I drink the medicinal spoon,\naugment the elixir crucible,\nand refine the true yang.\n\nThe vast expanse scatters,\nI encounter the immortal formula.\nI thank all you lords\nfor bestowing robes and provisions.\nReopening the Daoist feast,\nmending the precious spirit-light,\nI enjoy the rosy lifespan,\nincrease blessings and wisdom,\nand distance sorrow.\n\n**To Little Liu of Laizhou**\nWithout form or lustrous light,\ndo not let it drift away.\nScatter the mystery-pearls,\nthe precious kernels of true auspice.\nFollowing emotions, they flow and turn,\nsettling into emptiness and decay.\nThe Dao is hard to accomplish,\nmerit hard to achieve,\nkarma hard to bear.\n\nWith focused sincerity,\ngrasp yin and yang.\nTraverse the numinous palaces,\noffer incense in the jeweled halls.\nGolden lads pair,\njade maidens form ranks.\nThe five gates open,\nthe twin passes

things,\nlet every affair rest.\nHold fast to pure thoughts,\nrevere and admire the mysterious wind.\nEver delight in true joy,\nseek the true essence,\nawaken to true emptiness.\n\nThe bright moon fills the breast,\nilluminating and dispelling evil traces.\nWith cloud companions\nand rosy companions met,\ntogether we transcend the dharma-realm,\nreturning to the immortal palace.\nWe pay homage to the Great Lofty One,\nthe sages of all heavens,\nthe Jade Void’s lineage.\n\n**Two Poems in Thanks for the Gift of Incense from the Princess**\n\n**I**\nTrembling and reverent,\nI kindle the

Xu’s Devotion to Goodness**\nThe bitter sea stretches boundless,\ndeeply pitiable.\nThat gust of wind—\na slight awakening to the true constant.\nClothing and cap unkempt,\nworldly karma

three vehicles,\nsurpasses the ten stages—\nno difficulty at all.\n\nFive-colored rings revolve,\nsmelting the golden elixir.\nBehold the immortal furnace,\nempty yet coiled with dragons.\nYin and yang’s numbers complete,\nthe heavenly pass is struck through.\nThen one treads the auspicious clouds,\nascends to the origin,\nand joins the ranks of immortals.\n\n**Sixteen \"Sumuzhe\"**\n\n**Admonishing Daoists Against Strife**\nThose who leave the household\nmust be resolute.\nSearch within yourself,\ndo not discuss others’ faults.\nLet not life and destiny be entangled by dust.\nDiligently cultivate,\nalone refining the obstinate heart.\n\nNurture harmony,\nthe spirit unconfused.\nDrop by drop, the numinous cinnabar\nis borne to the cloudy Han.\nThe jade maiden and golden lad display their skill.\nWithout action or striving,\naccompanied by the true emptiness beyond things.\n\n**For Zhao Xinwu of Ninghai**\nThe Five Illuminations Palace,\nthe Three Lights shine.\nThe eight meridians’ infant,\nthe nine revolutions penetrate the mysterious wonder.\nIn the Seven Treasures Grove, they ever dance and leap.\nThe ten stages are exquisitely wrought,\na single true laughter.\n\nVast and obscure,\nobscure and vast.\nThe immortals of past and present\nare forever summoned together.\nOuter paths and heavenly demons remain unaware.\nOnly then is round completion rejoiced,\nfully and again fully accomplished.\n\n**Expressing My Feelings**\nI am wild and unrestrained,\ntruly nine hundred strong.\nUnfettered through heaven and earth,\nthe crisp qi still feels confined.\nThe great Dao flows unimpeded, without barrier.\nEarth is still, heaven clear—\neach step lightly and swiftly taken.\n\nEvening clouds gather,\nthe autumn moon is white.\nMyriad images interweave,\nbrilliant and flowing with pure hue.\nDo not say Dongmou lacks feathered guests.\nThe wondrous workings of the mystery,\ntruly and surely attain the constant.\n\n**At the Shrine of Master Danyang**\n\n**Yanming Jiang and Zhong Zizheng**\n\nYanming Jiang and Zhong Zizheng,\nMaster Wenju among the three friends,\neach poured forth their cinnabar sincerity to attain the upright.\nAiding in the unfolding of the Mystery Gate,\nthey transformed and flourished the realm of Changyang.\n\nJade Yang Wang took the lead,\nguiding the sleeves of others.\nExternal temptations swayed the many lords,\nyet they bore fruit in the Quanzhen practice.\nCraftsmen and fellow practitioners must show utmost reverence.\nMoved by the winds of Fufeng,\nthey aspired solely toward Penglai.\n\nThe Dharma names of Jiang and Zhong:\nZhong Shouzhong, Jiang Shoujing.\nThey guided Danyang’s transmission,\ndelivering and liberating all spiritual natures.\nWith earnest devotion and steadfast hearts, all held them in respect.\nFar and near, their virtue spread,\nand all revered them as true sages.\n\nYet now, who still listens?\nThe craftsmen face hardship,\nrecklessly wielding their sharp edges.\nHow much fine timber is cast aside!\nFirst, they demand payment,\ndaring not defy their commands.\n\n**Xu Gong’s Inquiry on the Fruits of Adversity**\n\nGuard the sprouting bud, nurture the auspicious fruit.\nThe seven-jeweled golden lotus\nshall bear the fruit of long life.\nThrough non-action and non-striving, the Dao’s fruit is attained.\nEmerging from the mundane cage,\none decisively verifies the fruit of true immortality.\n\nTo cultivate in old age is difficult,\nfor true essence leaks away,\nruining the fruit of the Jetavana.\nClapping hands in vain, one returns without cause or effect.\nLike the relentless march of impermanence,\nhasten to refine the fruit of Quanzhen.\n\n**Sending Master Danyang’s Dharma Body to the Western Pass**\n\nAlas, the wayward husband strays from the true Dao,\ndeftly wielding schemes,\nslandering with cunning and deceit.\nThe sect’s traditions are ruined, with nowhere to appeal.\nLike a shattered mirror or a kite’s broken wings,\nhow can I make this clear?\n\nNow, who dares to vouch?\nPoison concealed within,\nthey bring disgrace upon the Quanzhen teachings.\nFrom the Eastern Sea to Western Qin, all are afflicted.\nCao, Jia, and Lai—\nheavenly retribution must come.\n\n**Admonition to Li, Liang, and Zhang**\n\nLi, Zhang, and Liang, heed my brief words.\nDo not hesitate or waver,\nlest your hearts be overturned.\nEver resentful that Jade Yang offers no reply,\nwith such cultivation,\nwhen shall you return to Penglai Isle?\n\nThe monk of Great Tang, old Jiudu,\nendured ten thousand hardships,\nyet with single-minded resolve, he pressed on.\nEastward he journeyed to propagate the Buddha’s teachings,\nharmonizing with the Tathāgata,\nverifying the fruit of the true and constant Dao.\n\n**Exhortation Against Nets and Traps**\n\nSince birth, I have never feared death.\nWith roots deeply anchored,\none verifies the position of long life.\nAll sentient beings share no slight difference.\nMay all be universally safe—\nthis is the will of Heaven.\n\nWielding compassion,\npresenting refined auspices,\nradiant clouds and rosy mists arise,\nmyriad rays of auspicious light.\nThe lofty immortals of the three realms rejoice in the Dharma,\nsafeguarding all people,\neach free from calamity and harm.\n\n**Exhortation to the Deluded**\n\nAlas, the deluded, like the deeply drunk,\ndare to scheme and contend,\ndisputing heaven and earth.\nKilling, stealing, lust, and deceit violate divine principles.\nEver ignorant,\nheedless of the impending judgment.\n\nWhen qi returns to emptiness and form decays,\nconsciousness flickers faintly,\nwandering into the dark prison.\nWho will release the boundless wronged souls?\nWhips lash their bodies,\nserpents and dogs vie to devour them.\n\n**Exhortation to Boatmen**\n\nI urge you all to take an oath:\nlay aside your nets and traps,\nseek livelihoods in kindness.\nThe gods and spirits watch over you.\nMay your blessings and longevity multiply,\nand may you savor sweetness anew.\n\nAttain true joy, cast off filth.\nWith a nature perfectly luminous,\nall dharmas are relinquished.\nQuietly observe the wellspring of spirit arise in elegance.\nReturn to youth, reclaiming\nthe realm of pure coolness.\n\n**Three Exhortations on Cultivation**\n\nDiscern the Three Fields, unblock the Eight Vessels.\nNine revolutions of radiance,\na single speck of dust cannot intervene.\nUnfettered true compassion flows into the obscure and silent.\nThe cinnabar treasure and spiritual sprout\nbear the hues of blue, yellow, and white.\n\nPierce the Kun Palace, the abode of the immortal cassia.\nThe divine pearl emerges and retreats,\nbeyond the void, blazing crimson.\nI exhort the transient guests of the dusty world:\ngather your hearts early,\nand complete the true merit.\n\n**Again**\n\nTo cultivate, you must thoroughly investigate.\nGrasp the wellspring of spirit,\nlest the cinnabar elixir leak away.\nThis practice is rare in the world.\nWithin, attain the wholeness of spirit;\nwithout, attain longevity of body.\n\nDiscern the harmonious merging, illuminate the union.\nJade liquid and nectar,\nswallowing the brilliance of the Three Lights.\nCirculating above and below, completing the nine nines,\nbursting through the Gate of Heaven,\nforever befriending the mist and rosy clouds.\n\n**Again**\n\nIn the white lotus pond, the golden liquid marsh,\ndragons sport with luminous pearls,\npurple mists ever encircling.\nTigers charge the flock of sheep at the mountain’s base.\nStartled, the white ox leaps\nby the winding river’s edge.\n\nThe red simurgh soars, the vermilion phoenix cries.\nThe infant at the sea’s bottom\nholds fast, laughing with the tortoise and serpent.\nThe yellow sprout grows through each joint.\nWithin yin, yang is born—\nhow many truly know this?\n\n**To Li Yiweng of Penglai**\n\nSpeaking of cultivation, you have been granted favor.\nTruly turn your heart,\nwhy cling to wife and children?\nA true man does not let others count his debts.\nThrough the bitter sea he roams,\nseeking a path forward.\n\nEscape the dusty world, emerge from the dark abode.\nThe seven ancestors who have passed\nare delivered and ascend on cloud steps.\nHaving escaped the wheel of rebirth, you gradually awaken.\nWhen merit is complete and practice fulfilled,\nyou shall surely be summoned by the Three Purities.\n\n**On Encountering Opportunities for Transformation**\n\nMeeting the conditions for practice, encountering wise friends,\nthe Dharma water irrigates the heart,\neach drop penetrating with numinous clarity.\nGathered in the furnace, nothing strays outward.\nThe two qi ascend and merge,\ninverting and converging in auspicious radiance.\n\nPiercing the Mud Pill, flowing behind the elbows,\nday and night diligently,\nnot allowing the slightest leak.\nSeizing the Mystery Pearl, presenting it with skillful hands,\nstepping on clouds toward the azure sky,\nonly then is the great Dao accomplished.\n\n**Gazing Toward Penglai (To the Tune of \"Wang Jiangnan\") – Four Poems**\n\n**Sent to Master Chaoyuan**\n\nMaster Chaoyuan,\nespecially intimate with the Dao.\nThe good karma of past vows manifests today,\nthe wondrous fruit of the future unfolds anew.\nDay by day, it grows ever clearer.\n\nMastering

      "translated_text": "**By Wang Chuyi of Yuyang of the Sacred Waters – Poetry [Seven-Character Regulated Verse]**\n\nIn the *ding-si* year of the Cheng’an era, I received the third imperial summons and arrived at Tianchang Abbey in the capital on the twenty-fifth day of the sixth month. On the third day of the seventh month, I was granted an audience and offered a seat. The Emperor inquired about the *Scripture of Purity and Tranquility*, and I expounded upon it. He then asked about the northern campaign, to which I replied: \"It shall cease in the *wu-wu* year.\" This later proved true. Next, he questioned me on the Quanzhen lineage, and I answered each query in turn. The Emperor expressed deep admiration and detained me until dusk before I was permitted to leave. The following day, I was bestowed a purple robe and the title *Master of Embodied Mystery*. A close attendant was dispatched to convey the imperial decree, granting me Chongfu and Xiuzhen Abbeys to reside in as I pleased, along with a monthly allowance of two hundred strings of cash for vegetarian meals. While staying at Xiuzhen Abbey, I composed this poem to send to my aged mother and the Daoist community of Sacred Waters.\n\nBeneath Xiuzhen Abbey, messages flow unimpeded,\nAs auspicious light shuttles through the azure sky.\nOnce I met a radiant master who revealed the true teaching;\nNow I receive the sagely Emperor’s aid in spreading the mystic wind.\nFrom this day, Yuyang shall guide transformation,\nAnd the Dharma assembly shall henceforth cultivate with diligence.\nI bow to my compassionate mother—cast aside all worry,\nFor the imperial grace has not yet permitted my return home.\n\n**For the Wife of the Surveillance Commissioner, Seeking Healing from Illness**\n\nHeaven-born, Heaven-long, in accord with Heaven’s cultivation,\nNo matter the dusty world or the bones of the vulgar.\nHow could the four impermanent states approach the Phoenix Terrace?\nHow could the three corpses reach the isles of Yingzhou?\nAwakening to truth, the inner light forgets new afflictions;\nGrasping the root, the heart turns to ash, dispelling old sorrows.\nThe colorless true emptiness transcends the other shore,\nSteadily riding the boundless great divine vessel.\n\n**Presented to Lü, Abbot of Zu’an Abbey**\n\nGreat awakening’s majestic light illumines the vast sky,\nThe true auspice of prior Heaven arrives in haste.\nThe void and pure, serene and still, endure through past and present;\nThe supreme Dao flows forth, rightly transmitted by the ancestral masters.\nThe three realms and ten directions are all of one accord,\nThe thousand scriptures and myriad discourses—inexhaustible in their profundity.\nForgetting emotion, the Lord of Heavenly Origin manifests,\nEmerging from within the transformations of yin and yang.\n\n**Presented to the Abbess of Weizhou Abbey**\n\nWho has encountered a living immortal?\nTruly nurturing numinous clarity, piercing the azure heavens.\nFrom the jade treasury, true water and fire are drawn and replenished;\nIn the jasper palace, auspicious clouds and mist congeal.\nForm and spirit both wondrous—who can comprehend?\nEmptiness and form wholly dissolved—how can the principle be conveyed?\nThe four seas turn their light inward, all revering the teaching;\nNaturally, merit and virtue fill the three thousand realms.\n\n**Two Poems Presented to the Daoist Community for Their Support**\n\nDeep gratitude to our lineage for its vast support,\nSteadfast and unwavering in diligent refinement.\nPreserving the spirit in silence, dust remains unstained;\nCultivating qi in continuity, the Dao is natural.\nRevealing the original source, the pure and tranquil Lord;\nTransforming and generating the mystic image, the embryonic immortal dances.\nThe revolving jade pivot governs the true Three Treasures,\nImmovable, the light of compassion fills the great thousandfold world.\n\nUpholding the Dao in poverty, the Dao is nameless,\nAll depends on the human heart’s sincere resolve.\nOne qi circulates, purifying the cosmos;\nThe three luminaries converge, gathering the numinous.\nAuspicious omens at the jade altar conceal the immortal’s traces;\nPropitious radiance from the precious tripod veils transformation and birth.\nUttering the true oral formula of the inner elixir,\nWondrous workings dance and abide, spontaneously perfected.\n\n**[Ode to Yuqing Abbey]**\n\nThe master’s former retreat—Zhuyan’s northern Yuqing Abbey,\nCalled \"Little Sacred Waters,\" truly a place of excellence.\nThus, this poem.\n\nThis cliff’s sacred site is rare through past and present;\nLeisurely pacing through mist and rosy clouds, the daylight lingers.\nThe sages of the three realms cast their regard;\nThe Dao and virtue of this land are wholly refined.\nPair upon pair of youths bear flowered staves;\nCouple after couple of auspicious simurghs dance upon the jade steps.\nSoon, the great elixir shall be completed and I shall return;\nWith those of karmic affinity, I shall accompany them to the Jasper Pool.\n\n**For Clerk Wang of Fushan, Seeking Instruction Due to Illness**\n\nGently, subtly nurturing harmony,\nSilently cultivating the heart, emerging from the river of desire.\nAugmenting the Valley Spirit, ever unceasing;\nTransmitting the blood and pulse, forever free from ailment.\nRealizing the true and emitting the Dao, forgetting birth and death;\nPerceiving nature and penetrating the numinous, severing demonic obstructions.\nAge after age, it is due to upright merit and virtue;\nThe myriad spirits all bear one aloft from the world of suffering.\n\n**For Attendant Wu, Staying Through Summer**\n\nWell met, sharing this place to seek coolness,\nGathering the numinous cinnabar, its fragrance beyond the heavens.\nThe four great elements return, the qi pure and temperate;\nThe twin springs irrigate, the jade countenance radiant.\nRegulating the spirit, immovable—misfortune becomes blessing;\nEncountering things without partiality—yin reverts to yang.\nAnother livelihood, idly passing the days,\nUnfurling the precious scriptures, perusing two or three lines.\n\n**Two Poems on Escaping the World’s Net**\n\nAccord with Heaven’s merit and virtue, transforming and arising,\nThe Dharma-body’s luminosity pervades the nine realms.\nThe wisdom-eye, limpid and clear, without the slightest attachment;\nThe spirit-pearl, bright and resplendent, utterly free from dust.\nThe five directions’ numinous radiance soars heavenward;\nA single blossom of the heart brushes the sun, unfolding.\nThe true visage through the vast kalpa appears anew;\nOnly then does one know that everywhere is Penglai.\n\nFreed from the world’s net, no entanglements remain;\nThe elixir already perfected, the Dao is natural.\nFrom the Purple Palace, jade snow flutters;\nFrom the Jasper Terrace, golden lotuses gradually bloom.\nThe palaces of the spirit, segment by segment, perfectly coalesce;\nThe Dharma-nature, empty and vast, shines in full illumination.\nWithin and without, the golden-jade body is refined;\nAll because of a single encounter with a Great Luo Immortal.\n\n**Two Poems on Rustic Aspirations**\n\nFor decades, muddled wine and wild song,\nA body unburdened, roaming in dreams as an immortal.\nPreserving the heart to save and deliver across the three realms;\nThe entire being luminous, piercing the nine heavens.\nA life beyond the world—only I understand;\nThe treasures within the gourd—who pities them?\nThe Jade Yang Master of the eastern cloud-sea,\nDelivers the foolish and deluded, never transmitting in vain.\n\nI shall open and transform, blending the three yangs,\nLayer upon layer of mist and rosy clouds filling the ten directions.\nRefining the precious pearl, containing the Dharma-realm;\nTransforming and generating numinous radiance, reaching the vault of heaven.\nTiger and dragon coil around the golden tripod;\nSun and moon soar, illuminating the jade hall.\nBy the time I ride the simurgh back to the Purple Palace,\nIn the realm of Great Peace, I shall harmonize with the light.\n\n**Two Poems in Response to Disciple Zhang Zhiming’s Inquiry on Daily Practice**\n\nHark! Seeking the true amidst the false, like carving and polishing,\nEmbodying Heaven and modeling the Dao, nurturing harmony.\nWithin the shadows of the three luminaries, the heart-seal is grasped;\nAmidst the gates of the myriad Dharmas, the honey of awakening is savored.\nTwo paths of pure wind penetrate the Purple Palace;\nThe six heavens’ will emerges from the world of suffering.\nThe non-existent and existent form a perfect sphere;\nSoon, one shall ascend to the Great Luo.\n\nThe jade nature gleams, illuminating the clear sky,\nOriginally non-action, summoning fortune and wisdom.\nThe mysterious principle flows freely, truly at ease;\nThe wondrous light, limpid and clear, roams at will.\nA single note of celestial music ascends the golden palace;\nTwo streams of numinous spring irrigate the auspicious sprout.",

affinities,\nImpartial toward all things, in harmony with Heaven above.\nFivefold radiance gathers in the wisdom-nature,\nMyriad hues of rosy clouds cluster in the cinnabar field.\nA pure tone beyond the void conveys the true essence,\nAmidst the waves of the bitter sea, the Dharma-boat plies.\nNo certification, no cultivation—truly complete,\nThe original merit and practice are naturally perfect.\n\nDwelling in dust yet unstained—\nVacuity congeals into elegance, forming the numinous embryo,\nThough in the world of dust, the Dao-eye opens.\nWine, lust, anger, wealth—others’ livelihoods,\nYet spirit and blood-vessels root in the self.\nLet the primordial sea dwell together,\nAs Kunlun’s heights freely traverse to and fro.\nThis cause and condition is truly certain,\nNon-action and purity reach Penglai.\n\nTwo Self-Chants\n\nEastern clouds and seas, a gentle breeze,\nAll day in non-action, speaking of suffering and emptiness.\nA single point of perfect clarity, truly complete,\nTwice encountered, the nature melts in fusion.\nThe three fields forge the elixir of longevity,\nNine years’ cultivation perfects transcendent merit.\nOften gazing toward the celestial path of primordial dawn,\nThe light of Perfect Realization illumines the Great Luo Palace.\n\nLead and mercury merge to form the Great Elixir,\nConsumed, one instantly regains youthful countenance.\nThe physical body harmonizes yin and yang’s reckoning,\nThe true nature transcends life and death’s barrier.\nThe eight meridians flow with the sea of primordial qi,\nMyriad spirits gather on Jade Capital Mountain.\nRevolving and repeating, arrayed anew,\nThe Heavenly Perfected of the Limitless freely come and go.\n\nTwo Instructions for Disciples\n\nEspecially for fellow travelers, pointing to superior affinity,\nFrom beginning to end, the will remains steadfast.\nIn quietude, subtly aiding the truly real,\nIn warmth and fullness, all affairs must be relinquished.\nFurther, act sincerely among people,\nLike the evergreen lotus in fire.\nClouds and rosy clouds guide steps toward the primordial,\nWhen merit is complete, the three thousand and great thousand worlds are attained.\n\nAll the lofty and wise together form affinity,\nIn the depths of the bitter sea, golden lotuses are planted.\nEmerging from dust, fragrant and resplendent, free from all filth,\nIlluminating the body, radiance shines upon the nine heavens.\nFrom the outset, the true Dao-eye is revealed,\nCultivating the supreme Perfected of the Great Luo.\nTranscending past and present, the true numinous nature,\nComplete and clear, not a single Dharma is transmitted.\n\nThe Immortal Realm\n\nThe immortal realm, towering and inscrutable to the world,\nFilled with rare fragrances and jade dust.\nRainbow banners and crimson tassels pay homage at the golden palace,\nFeathered canopies and cloud flags reflect upon jeweled terraces.\nThe sagely Perfected of the three realms gather in assembly,\nThe youths of the five directions linger in long reverie.\nUnchanged through ancient and modern times—who can perceive it?\nOnly those with the Dao-eye opened through spiritual communion.\n\nPerfect Realization\n\nMy master propagated the Dao, establishing Perfect Realization,\nFirst encountering Pure Yang, receiving the secret texts.\nThe nature fills the void, congealing luminous brilliance,\nThe elixir perfected, inside and out, auspicious clouds form.\nInstantly transcending the Dharma-realm, leaving the mysterious teaching,\nTransforming humans and heavens, praising the sagely sovereign.\nDelivering all beings from myriad sufferings,\nNaturally, the world and seas universally know and hear.\n\nEncountering the Master’s Transmission\n\nI once encountered a living immortal,\nNurturing numinous clarity, piercing the azure sky.\nThe heart enters the crimson palace, obscurely illuminating,\nQi exhales into the cinnabar furnace, naturally revolving.\nForm and spirit both wondrous, locked in mist and rosy clouds,\nMovement and stillness both forgotten, nature and life complete.\nUniversally wishing the world to comprehend this principle,\nAll at once, together boarding the boat for saving others.\n\nTwo Gifts for Fellow Daoists\n\nIn pure poverty and gentle weakness, the face delights in redness,\nThe original nature, carefree, yearns for the orthodox lineage.\nFurther wishing to gather the spirit, investing within,\nThen abandoning the false, awakening to true emptiness.\nThe numinous source firmly secured, without any leaks,\nThe divine sword brandished, slaying the nine worms.\nRefining cinnabar to perfection, understanding the fire’s timing,\nSitting and watching the crow and hare, freely east and west.\n\nHeaven’s harmony, earth’s principle, and human peace,\nThe three teachings and three talents are all the same.\nThe nature-candle’s light, ever bright and unwavering,\nThe numinous youth leaps in joyful pursuit.\nFloating clouds disperse, the zenith of meditation clears,\nExternal affairs embraced, the sea of awakening widens.\nUnrestrained and carefree, observing self-so,\nThe original countenance forever beheld.\n\nAnswering a Question on the Method of Peace and Bliss\n\nThe great Dao of vacuity, the secret of Perfect Realization,\nSurpassing wealth for the nation and peace for the people.\nLiberating the numinous palace, myriad transformations arise,\nThe harmonious sea of qi dispels a thousand ailments.\nStability transcends the great leakless divine boat,\nRolling forth into the autumn night’s moonlit sky.\nThe nature, perfectly bright, the Dao naturally completes,\nRevolving and repeating, arrayed anew.\n\nFor the Newly Departed from the Household\n\nTurning the head to seek the path to the Eternal Capital,\nInternally and externally, completely empty, sweeping the heart.\nUtterly exhausting schemes, reaching the profound and obscure,\nDrawing and adding water and fire, illuminating inversion.\nRefining the four images and three talents,\nExpelling the seven emotions and six wastes.\nA single nature, radiant, illumines the great void,\nOn Jade Capital, naturally, the golden scripture reports.\n\nTwo Instructions for Disciples on Proofreading Merit and Practice\n\nExhorting and transforming, the will in affinity remains firm,\nExerting the heart, all are as I am.\nThe golden pass unlocks, the mysterious wind penetrates,\nThe iron tree blooms, the great Dao is transmitted.\nSubduing the myriad spirits, all rejoice,\nReporting through three lifetimes, free from calamity and transgression.\nThe friends of the ten directions should seek and obtain,\nAwakening to true emptiness, all become immortals.\n\nA naturally singular realm, truly vast,\nAccordant with the principle of the subtle and obscure.\nNurturing the nameless, pure and tranquil body,\nTransforming without destruction, the profound and obscure lineage.\nBanners and streamers, flashing, arrayed in the cloudy Han,\nJade girdle pendants, tinkling, descend from the great void.\nReceiving and guiding, perfectly bright, truly complete,\nThe Dharma-wheel constantly turns, circulating the mysterious wind.\n\nTwo Poems on Creation and Transformation\n\nWondrous practice and true merit, complete in ten years,\nUniversally uniting with the Dharma-Dao, refining true immortals.\nGently, the lead furnace’s divine light bursts forth,\nVividly, the numinous cinnabar’s fire timing is complete.\nThe twofold mysterious wind penetrates the mountain’s peak,\nA single stream of cold jade descends upon the mushroom field.\nSplitting open chaos to observe the limitless,\nExpansively, the numinous root nurtures the vast and unconstrained.\n\nPreserving the body, pure and elegant, tiger and dragon roar,\nSilently, true compassion turns through ancient and modern times.\nThe Supreme Ultimate’s original lineage opens creation and transformation,\nFrom the outset, the mysterious image flows in ascent and descent.\nThe spirit gathers the five viscera, evil cannot enter,\nThe nature extinguishes the three corpses, the Dao naturally seeks itself.\nAfter a single great elixir ripens,\nThe precious flower, perfectly round, emerges from the jade peak.\n\nDharma Kin\n\nOn Jade Capital, the immortal kin, my heart’s fellowship,\nFortune bestowed, prosperity flourishes, misfortune does not befall.\nHell transforms into a hall for transmitting the Dao,\nThe fire pit becomes a bridge for delivering immortals.\nLeisurely listening to the Dharma-drum resounding on the numinous peak,\nThen readying the cloud chariot, sailing the purple empyrean.",

tradition.\n\n**Instructions to the Assembly**\nThe assembly for cultivating the real has profound trust,\nSpreading prayers, the primordial great Dao is opened.\nWithout, transforming and giving life, a leisurely livelihood,\nWithin, refining and forging, a fine family tradition.\nClear sounds, distinct, piercing the Milky Way,\nJade nature, numinous, speaking the orthodox

nods.\n\nCleansing the heart, refining within, a wheel of light,\nExpounding the Dao, opening the real, filling the ten directions.\nAccumulating virtue, even gods and ghosts revere,\nNurturing the real, do not be harmed by worldly passions.\nYin and yang’s inversion, people scarcely perceive,\nNature and life’s perfection, the world cannot fathom.\nThe dharma realm’s numinous clarity, all

cultivation,\nHeaven, earth, and humanity’s ethics are harmonized as one.\nIf you move with sincere resolve, never retreating,\nYou will decisively awaken to the mysterious principle of non-birth.\nGe

virtue naturally perfect themselves.\n\n**To Younger Brother Sui on Cultivation**\nPurify body and mind, nurturing qi and spirit,\nRefining metal and jade, emerging from the sea of delusion.\nIn the three fields, secretly plant the medicine of years,\nOne day joyfully encountering the deathless person.\nFive-way heavenly light, shining and sparkling,\nSix-yang earthly qi, issuing and circulating.\nSteaming and permeating joints, penetrating flesh and bone,\nCertainly attending the Primordial, paying homage to the Purple Imperial Court.\n\n**To Erlang, Who Withdrew from the Dao**\nAt first entering my gate, all admired,\nWho knew you lacked the share to become a true friend.\nThe azure empyrean’s path is distant, the years near,\nThe black ledger’s name high, hell’s depths profound.\nFan Li and Zhang Liang are not easily learned,\nCauldron’s boiling soup and sword trees are not hard to find.\nIn the future, you will suffer merciless pain,\nRegretting your mad and reckless heart.\n\n**Lu Xuanwu Inquires of the Dao**\nA single qi’s ascent and descent merges the great elixir,\nOnly then knowing the numinous treasure naturally returns.\nGathering and storing the precious jade, returning to the central position,\nPicking and stirring heaven’s mechanism, infusing the inner visage.\nLight bursts from the nine palaces, observing the world,\nWith the Dao’s completion, eternally ranked among immortals.\nRiding a green simurgh, steadily soaring into empty space,\nHenceforth, your pure standard will guard the sea and mountains.\n\n**To the Diviner**\nExhaustively investigating heaven’s principles, most distinct,\nEspecially to resolve the world’s difficulties.\nDiscerning yin and yang’s timely prosperity and decline,\nAble to comprehend the sun and moon’s waxing and waning.\nFollowing the nine luminaries’ course, calamities befall,\nReversing the three yangs’ changes, misfortune does not invade.\nDo not wait until the inconstant heavenly limit arrives,\nWhen all, wise and foolish alike, fall into the deep pit.\n\n**To the Assembly of Shanghe County Seeking Teaching**\nShanghe truly encounters the returning light,\nStep by

coolness is attained.\n\n**To Zhang Zhenguo of the Capital Inquiring on Cultivating the True**\nLuminous clarity held within the heart’s embrace,\nFirmly rooted, delving deep with careful effort.\nGuard the treasure, lest other things steal it,\nWith no-mind, dwell in the world’s dust as one.\nConcealed subtleties reveal true suchness,\nMending and cherishing essence, the Dharma Sea empties.\nAuspicious traces and immortal tracks never cease,\nClearly ascending straight to the Great Luo Palace.\n\n**To Elder Zhang, Boatman of Northern Qingzhou, Who Asked**\nA single oar, an empty boat crosses the world,\nLightly drifting along cloud paths among the immortals’ ranks.\nWielding numinous brilliance, the golden crucible gathers,\nGrasping yin and yang, the jade ring turns.\nForever emerging from vast waves, leaving the sea of love,\nBrandishing the sharp sword to cleave the mountain of affection.\nIn Penglai and Langyuan’s immortal realms,\nWith a single thought of heart’s ashes, all may be scaled.\n\n**To Disciple Nanlü Ge**\nSearch the root-source of kalpas past,\nKnow this as the fine cause and reason.\nA thousand auspicious hues gather in the cinnabar valley,\nTen thousand streams of silver mist flow against the current.\nThe golden and wooden river chariot carries phoenix marrow,\nThe guiding and fire stove refines the frost orb.\nWhen the celestial cycle is complete, the divine elixir forms,\nFive-colored majestic light clusters the Ten Isles.\n\n**To Ren Ge of Sizhou Inquiring on the Great Matter of Nature and Life**\nThe harmonious union of nature and life is not difficult,\nWhen karmic obstructions are exhausted, light arises and the Dao comes and goes.\nSteady breathing, unbroken, connects to the true principle,\nCalm spirit, silent, seals the mysterious pass.\nGathering true brilliance, the elixir must coalesce,\nShattering emptiness, the nature is naturally at ease.\nA single spark of numinous light transcends creation,\nThe cloud chariot bears it to Jade Capital Mountain.\n\n**To Xu Shangya of Putai County**\nThe four great elements of the body are but empty float,\nBorrowing the false to cultivate the true holds another reason.\nThe supreme Dao, subtle and imperceptible, knows no extinction,\nThe original spirit, untrammeled, does not linger.\nThe gentle lead crucible bursts with golden light,\nThe tranquil spirit palace gathers jade flames.\nA master stands before you,\nMeeting, you clap hands and laugh without end.\n\n**Instructions to Disciples**\nIn emptiness and purity, establish the golden altar,\nSweep aside the wheel of rebirth and the gate of life and death.\nEmotions and nature harmonize like still water,\nQi and spirit intertwine like a returning ring.\nThe luminous pearl shines beyond the clouds,\nThe crane’s chariot drifts lightly beyond the world.\nUntil reaching the Great Luo Heaven’s realm,\nReturn in due time to restore your true countenance.\n\n**To Sun Si of Changjian, Laiyang**\nA letter sent to the worthy Sun Si,\nGently refining our family’s tradition.\nClear and discerning, body and mind purified,\nCold and serene, affairs and things emptied.\nSubtly and continuously, fulfill great filial piety,\nAwake and aware, return to the cloud palace.\nMay you, sir, join forces to propagate the true teaching,\nUniversally transforming all to awaken to the orthodox lineage.\n\n**To the Assembly of Dengzhou Visiting Sacred Waters**\nDharma kin and kindred spirits come and go freely,\nCloud-roaming sacred waters, traversing many mountains.\nTemporarily leaving the hundred knots of the dusty net,\nOften knocking at the secret gate of profound mystery.\nTrue wisdom arises from the nature,\nIn the crucible, the ancient countenance is recognized.\nReleasing the entire body, letting go of all thoughts,\nThis is carefree ease and leisure.\n\n**To Wang, Elder of Ninghai Prefecture, Who Served as Jiao Chief**\nConsider carefully before you now,\nHaving encountered this fine opportunity, act accordingly.\nHousehold prosperity flourishes through virtuous deeds,\nThe fortune star descends, surely dispelling misfortune.\nMay people be fortunate to support the mysterious teaching,\nLearning my non-action to reach the heavens above.\nThe rise and fall of the four seas are all transformed,\nEstablishing the teaching, hell becomes heaven.\n\n**In Response to the Prefect of Ninghai’s Repeated Summons**\nIncense never ceases, repeatedly summoning,\nWillingly tending the heart to nurture auspicious sprouts.\nRestraining the wicked through virtuous governance,\nComforting the old and young, praises resound.\nConstantly receiving the imperial court’s gracious light,\nYour loyal heart and blessed conduct shine forth.\nHoping that when merit is complete and fame achieved,\nYou too may come to the grove to discuss carefree ease.\n\n**To the Public Examination at Mingshui Palace**\nHeart spirit delights in awakening to true constancy,\nDay by day, selflessly reaching the heavens above.\nDo not cling to Confucian doors seeking outward display,\nBetter to search the principle and cherish original yang.\nThe roots of ten thousand dusts severed, transcend the three realms,\nA single effort’s success pervades the ten directions.\nTry comparing your future prospects,\nHow does serving as an official compare to reaching the immortal land?\n\n**In Response to Zhao Zhifa of Yizhou Inquiring on Cultivation**\nCloud traces unbroken, auspicious yang unfolds,\nAwakening to worldly ties, the heart turns to ashes.\nOnly sensing the pure qi within the body,\nGradually seeing the three powers gather in the crucible.\nGreen Dragon and White Tiger roar and howl,\nRed Phoenix and Dark Turtle battle and contend.\nArrayed around the celestial circuit, they meet in unison,\nWhen the Dao is accomplished, purple script will surely summon.\n\n**To Yang Dumu, Fundraising in the Capital for the Teaching**\nAssisting conditions, all things come in due time,\nIn the capital, radiance unfolds again and again.\nUndaunted by hardship, accomplishing good deeds,\nSurely encountering good fortune, far from calamity.\nThe old temple, once ruined, is rebuilt,\nFading good qi is once more cultivated.\nDeeply grateful for the sagely grace and meritorious power,\nMay you pray for vast blessings equal to Heaven’s Terrace.\n\n**Parting from Daoist Assembly Arriving from Afar**\nThis morning, parting from those known,\nUniversally transforming humans and heavens everywhere.\nIf you understand the crucible’s communion with sun and moon,\nYou will transcend the void’s bounds, stepping on clouds and rainbows.\nNot yet returning to Peng Isle to attend the true sages,\nFor now, in the dusty world, deliver the deluded.\nGood and evil, right and wrong, all unclinging,\nLet the crow and hare run east and west.\n\n**To Zhang, the Kitchen Attendant of the Cultivation Temple**\nIn the kitchen, Qinghe’s resolve is upright,\nDo not allow waste, carefully complete your work.\nPrecision and reverence always delight the immortals,\nFrugality gathers a hundred virtues.\nHaving turned toward the field of blessings, constantly nourished,\nNaturally, the heart-ground is forever at ease.\nWhen your merit is complete and you leave the dust,\nA single divine pearl will at last be seen.\n\n**Instructions to Disciples: Two Acrostic Poems**\n\n**I**\n□ opens the Dharma eye, within no sorrow,\n□ willingly, diligently upholding a hundred practices.\n□ auspicious, encountering the golden mouth’s decree,\n□ words, earnestly exhorting the Dao’s proper cultivation.\n□ field, above and below, freely coming and going,\n□ qi, circulating, moves as it will.\n□ bearing the immortal ranks, arrayed beyond the

in cultivation,\nTranscend the mundane, cut off all going and returning.\nMaintain impartiality, ever upright in heart,\nOne day you shall ascend to the azure heavens.\n\n**Zhang Gong inquires about sudden enlightenment**\nThe Dao is empty, formless, without a single thing,\nYet it responds to conditions, delivering all beings.\nReuniting with the Lord of Heaven’s Primordial Kalpa,\nAll ten thousand cycles of rebirth are instantly understood.\n\n**Wandering**\nLeisurely observing mountains and waters, roaming Peng Isle,\nWhite clouds blanket the earth, the wind sweeps of itself.\nQuietly reflecting on the toil of fleeting life,\nWho can cultivate this path to escape decay and aging?\n\n**Attaining the Elixir**\nThe crow flies, the hare flees into the center,\nIn the dim and wondrous source, the wondrous method is found.\nA single grain of the elixir pellet completes the nine transformations,\nAscending and transforming to fill the vault of heaven.\n\n**Awakening to Truth**\nAwakening brings earnest joy in true recognition,\nThe crown bathed in ambrosia, the qi expands.\nThe Great Dao’s harmony flows through midnight and noon,\nThe inner divine light rolls forth from the mud pill.\n\n**Pursuing the Dao**\nClear and turbid rise and fall, ever returning,\nDrowsy and silent, words fail to express.\nThe twin eyes need not gaze upon the celestial patterns,\nEars and nose, spiritually attuned, absorb the essence of the embryo.\n\n**Following Transformation**\nUpside-down and cyclical, like a drunken man,\nNeither sorrow nor joy, the inner truth remains whole.\nWhere spirit and energy move, divine waves surge,\nThe Three Realms are pure and void, free from specks of dust.\n\n**Returning to Truth**\nPenetrating the root source, a single point runs deep,\nThe spirit terrace nurtures the golden lingzhi.\nGolden light surges, transcending life and death,\nThe jade nature shines, illuminating past and present.\n\n**Saving Lives**\nTo save the empty body from great calamity,\nThe cycles of rebirth and death cannot contain it.\nThe divine spring’s sacred water flows through the mysterious valley,\nThe four seasons’ immortal flowers bloom within fire.\n\n**Nurturing the Dao**\nLong ago at the Eastern Sea, I first met the true,\nGrateful for your guidance and care, O enlightened lord.\nNow I await the Purple Edict to return to the immortal capital,\nTurning the jade door’s lock to enter the golden gate.\n\n**Transmitting Goodness**\nWhen merit is complete and conduct perfected, ascend to the origin,\nDo not overstep the pure age to forge bonds with all.\nMay the deluded universally return to the Supreme Dao,\nAiding in the cultivation of true blessings without end.\n\n**Illuminating Radiance**\nAll stand at Danyang’s miraculous stele,\nThe immortal’s traces, wondrous and mighty.\nEncompassing the subtle and profound, surpassing past and present,\nMending the mechanisms of creation’s primordial workings.\n\n**Attaining the Root**\nWith an empty heart and full belly, intent focused,\nSeize the horse and capture the ape to seek the enlightened immortal.\nPractice the Great Dao in purity and non-action,\nNo need to earnestly inquire of the azure heavens.\n\n**Recognizing Taboos**\nThroughout the twelve hours, the child of good and evil records,\nTranscribing names and deeds to present to Heaven’s Lord.\nAssessing merit and conduct without flaw,\nThe immortal ranks are surely attained without fail.\n\n**Female Daoist Liu Zhimiao of Huang County asks about daily practice**\nDiligently investigate daily practice with keen effort,\nEvery glance turned inward perfects a hundred deeds.\nRefining the self, forging truth to magnify the Great Dao,\nThe path ahead will naturally extinguish all transgressions.\n\n**The Four Assemblies Open and Transform**\nThe seven-jeweled golden lotus exudes auspicious qi,\nJade splendor and impartiality are our family’s style.\nThe Three Pure Lords communicate true virtue,\nA single stream of radiance shines everywhere alike.\n\n**In Reply to the Summons from the Seven Treasures Assembly of Wendeng**\nDeeply honored by your summons to build bridges,\nDiscoursing on the method of birthlessness and deathlessness.\nThe seven-jeweled golden lotus blooms in unison,\nThe celestial assemblies’ fragrance fills the empty sky.\n\n**Mr. Liu Seeks the True Formula of the Three Treasures**\nThe entire body’s light congeals the purple golden elixir,\nOne must attain spiritual clarity to recognize inner leisure.\nMastering the true oral formula of the Jade Field,\nGather the spirit in one thrust to pass the Three Passes.\n\n**The Assembly of the Golden Lotus Seeks Instruction**\nThe Dharma assembly arises from the Dao’s nature,\nPlanting golden lotuses in the depths of the bitter sea.\nThe gentle lead crucible’s divine light bursts forth,\nRolling out cinnabar to irradiate the azure heavens.\n\n**Returning to Harmony**\nReturn to the root, restore the origin, and reach the natural,\nThe void and purity transform into golden lotuses.\nFusing the Four Great Elements, the heart’s elixir forms,\nTen thousand rays of rosy light emerge from the grotto-heaven.\n\n**Comprehending Truth**\nFrom within the golden treasury, turn the body to emerge,\nA single point opens the jade splendor of Yao Pond.\nWind and moon drift beyond the heavens’ bounds,\nIn movement, stillness, sitting, and walking—this is Penglai.\n\n**Bestowed upon Liu Ku of Renshou, Fushan**\nThrough the ages, true compassion establishes great merit,\nOnly now, across the Three Heavens, does the encounter occur in haste.\nJoy and honor gradually reveal the profound mystery,\nAttaining this method, one knows the Dao’s unity.\n\n**[Sent to Master Danyang]**\nIn the fifteenth year of the Dading era, a disciple first vowed\nTo journey west to seek Master Danyang.\nThe master said: Why travel afar?\nOne day, we shall meet here.\nYet I cannot dismiss your

      "translated_text": "**To the Wandering Daoist**\nInfinite schemes and strategies are all but emptiness,\nThe true瑞 of primordial Heaven differs utterly.\nThe root-source awakened nature lies abandoned,\nVainly spinning through samsara in a dream.\n\n**For Fan Yongzhi’s Request**\nWhen will the bitter sea of samsara end?\nTurn back at once with fierce resolve.\nCherishing children, pitying wives, passing the years—\nA hundred years of karmic suffering, hollow and desolate.\n\n**Wang Liuweng Asks About Learning the Dao**\nGuard closely the primordial yang of father and mother,\nLest spilled water be irrecoverable.\nTrace the root, secure the stem—no birth, no death,\nSecretly dissolving the eternal sorrow of the Yellow Springs.\n\n**Two Poems for Zhang Shanyou of the Buddhist Gate**\nA single speck of true yang blends with the primordial beginning,\nThe immortals possess it, while worldly men do not.\nDivine radiance arrays all ten thousand images,\nSun and moon soar within the great elixir furnace.\n\nMorning recitations, evening rites, turning the golden scriptures,\nSnow-white lotus blooms from the heart’s soil.\nWishing you awaken to truth and refine within,\nCultivating a hundred practices to attain perfection.\n\n**Occasional Verse**\nCultivating truth, I briefly part from the cloudy wheel,\nWeightless heart-incense wafts to the nine heavens.\nLight arises within, dissolving defilements,\nMysterious workings and wondrous deeds fill the three thousand.\n\n**Burning the Boat and Net**\nSaving lives, abstaining from killing—true cultivation’s pact,\nA hundred misfortunes vanish, blessings remain.\nThe heart transforms into profound mystery,\nNaturally, spirit and qi flow unimpeded.\n\n**For Storekeeper Deng**\nMeticulously tallying goods, distinguishing each,\nUpright and selfless, not a coin misplaced.\nNurturing vastness, penetrating secrets,\nOnly then does one surpass all, within and without.\n\n**Two Poems for Li of Wendeng on the Daily Practice of Truth**\nGathering numinous mist into the jade crucible,\nRefining lead and tin in the divine furnace.\nPrising open the golden joints of the mysterious Dao,\nThe fire-timed immortal elixir passes through the tailgate.\n\nAwakening to truth, silently firing the inner elixir,\nIn stillness, the mysterious wind nurtures the auspicious sprout.\nGradually piercing the spirit terrace, ascending through the crown,\nOne realizes how the azure heavens lie on level ground.\n\n**Ode to the Peach Orchard**\nCrimson blossoms gleam in the sun, admiring the peach flowers,\nA scene unmatched in the human realm.\nI urge you, gentlemen, to turn beyond the world,\nWhere the depths of the grotto-heavens are even more splendid.\n\n**On the Yellow Register Grand Offering’s Impartial Use**\nDisbursing and gathering amidst a flurry of affairs,\nEach act selfless, embracing true uprightness.\nWithin and without, let none grow lax,\nOnly then can the living and dead escape the depths.\n\n**For Dyer Han of Dengzhou**\nSkilled in dyeing blue, red, black, and yellow,\nOther hues pale in comparison.\nYet better to refine the true countenance within,\nWhere resplendent celestial light illumines the ten directions.\n\n**Lament for Dan Yang**\nOn the twenty-second day of the twelfth lunar month, *guimao* year of the Dading era,\nDan Yang shed his form and ascended in mist.\nLike lightning and thunder striking the great void,\nThe primordial vessel wielded its mighty power.\nDemons and specters scattered with the wind,\nRevealing the perfect accomplishment of Dao and virtue.\n\n**For the Three Wang Elders of Dengzhou Who Leave Home**\nWithout revealing the mysterious mechanism, one does not leave home,\nLeaving home with a cluttered mind is like drifting sand.\nThe root-source sea of awakening lies abandoned—\nHow then can harmonious qi sprout the Dao’s bud?\n\n**For Cui of Dizhou’s Examination Request**\nThe great Dao of the Primordial Origin is not hard to fathom,\nWith unwavering resolve and purity, all dharmas are empty.\nA single qi contains the essence of heaven and earth,\nAwakening to truth, one ascends directly to the Great Luo Palace.\n\n**For Niu of the Examination Hall Who Donates a Wooden Clapper and Seeks Teaching**\nAll things, great and small, unite with truth,\nAll stemming from the square inch of the heart’s good cause.\nThough mingling in the floating world’s splendor,\nThe body’s golden light remains unstained by dust.\n\n**For Tian of the Examination Hall’s Request**\nIn the realm of emptiness and leisure, sow the field of zhi,\nGather essence to form auspicious lotuses.\nAll transformations submit to the pure and tranquil master,\nPenetrating all without obstruction—true immortality realized.\n\n**For Gao, an Official of Yanzhou, Who Seeks Teaching**\nTo escape the gate of samsara and death,\nFrom the very first, a single speck allows no return.\nForgetting emotion, refine the true Three Treasures within,\nWinning carefree leisure beyond the world.\n\n**For Wang the Second Elder of the Medicine Shop in Le’an**\nThe immortal herbs of Penglai are neither distant nor deep,\nConstantly refine the gold within water.\nTreasure light radiates through the three realms,\nThis is the numinous clarity that transcends ancient and modern.\n\n**Two Poems for the Seventh Gentleman of Binzhou Upon His Recovery from Illness**\nPrimordial qi of emptiness and nothingness forms the embryo,\nPure and luminous, it circulates to and fro.\nUniting the Three Fields without leakage,\nMeeting the true speck, one may reclaim the body.\n\nThe essence of rice and wheat sprouts the Dao’s bud,\nIn the jade hall, purple gold sand is simmered.\nThe three powers and four images spin in emptiness,\nAfter nine years, one rides clouds to boast of Penglai.\n\n**For Li, the Registrar of Laizhou**\nAll matters, great and small, must be known,\nAmidst official duties, one acts with ease.\nWhen the path ahead reaches peril,\nRegret not failing to learn from Zhang Lingzi—\nLingzi, a Tang-era clerk who met Pure Yang and left home to attain the Dao.\n\n**Sighing for the World**\nGreed, deceit, and delusion never cease,\nThe heart without true use invites calamity.\nThe original spirit and qi dissipate entirely,\nVainly spinning through samsara, battling ancient and modern.\n\n**For Zou Lang Who Mourns His Wife and Seeks Teaching**\nHidden inner beauty once ascended to the immortal palace,\nNow the numinous root lies scattered in the earthen mound.\nI teach you the two paths of gain and loss—\nSeek diligently the arts of liberating the body.\n\n**For the Yu Residence, Where Grudges Cannot Be Reconciled**\nForging great enmity like mountains,\nTen thousand misfortunes descend, yet they remain unaware.\nHarming children, grandchildren, and ancestors,\nVying in the bitter sea of samsara.\n\n**For You, the Official of Fushan**\nIn the blink of an eye, over twenty-four years have passed,\nOutwardly robust, inwardly exhausted.\nImpermanence presses close, hair turned to snow—\nRegret not completing the great elixir furnace.\n\n**For Liu, the Elder of Laizhou**\nSilently the heart stills, all affairs cease,\nBleakly, formless, one gathers the root.\nClearly observing being within non-being,\nSteadily sailing the prajñā boat alone.\n\n**Two Poems for Master Dong of Guanzhong**\nTransporting essence, bearing marrow, crossing the passes,\nLight along the spine blazes, myriad paths open.\nNectar pours upon the crown, auspicious signs arise,\nThe twin wheels of sun and moon shine upon the jade terrace.\n\nThis numinous clarity seeks nothing without,\nIn the jade hall, the esoteric art holds all spirits.\nThe crow’s light and hare’s stillness array anew,\nRed phoenix and green luan nod in laughter.\n\n**Dreaming of Wandering the Immortals’ Realm**\nDrunk, I recline in the high void, gazing upon the Great Luo,\nWho understands my nurturing of harmonious emptiness?\nI have visited the jade palaces and purple courts,\nConstantly wielding the jade seal to vanquish ten thousand demons.\n\n**For the Two Generals of Laiyang**",

receive his teaching.\nReturning to the cloud palaces to pass the years,\nThis time, the completion of the Perfect Realization is clear.\n\n**Transforming the Mundane**\nSuddenly casting off the sea of worldliness to admire immortal winds,\nSweeping away dusty entanglements, the ten thousand dharmas empty.\nEncountering the primordial lord of pure clarity,\nThusness unmoving, naturally majestic.\n\n**Transforming the Six Relations**\nEach and every one, all sent back,\nNo thought of favor or disgrace, the heart turns to ash.\nEmotions forgotten, love severed, jade flowers bloom,\nThe radiance of the Numinous Treasure shines, a single point opens.\n\n**For Master Tian of Yutian County in Jizhou**\nYutian’s Numinous Treasure knits the spirit embryo,\nHeaven and earth’s brilliance flows within.\nThe four greats unborn, truly realized,\nOnly then does one know every place is Penglai.\n\n**For the Assembly at the Capital’s Cultivation Temple**\nFirm in poverty, guarding the Dao with earnest perseverance,\nAll before the eyes is selfless, free of love and hate.\nEvery woman and man as father and mother,\nNaturally the heart-ground becomes limpid.\n\n**Emerging from the World**\nThe three realms’ emptiness holds but one master,\nTranscending heaven and earth, peerless and beyond compare.\nEver bestowing the myriad transformations, revering the mysterious power,\nUniversally hooking the leviathans from the sea of suffering.\n\n**Lady Jiang of Fushan Asks About Cultivation**\nLearning the Dao is like smelting gold in fire,\nTrue gold refined, its purple radiance deep.\nThe three treasures of the spirit palace set in motion,\nA single orb of perfect clarity comprehends past and present.\n\n**For Li, Zhao, and Bai as Dao Companions**\nEach awakens to the emptiness of floating splendor,\nThree of one mind, accumulating true merit.\nCommuning inwardly in the subtleties of the formless,\nTransmitting the Dao, the

mind is the great dharma-king of all dusts,\nLet it not be tossed about by the drifting winds.\nNaturally, inner and outer true emptiness conjoins,\nThen returning to Penglai, one recognizes the homeland.\n\n**For Great Perfection Jian of Binzhou**\nThe pure clarity of immortal practice is not difficult,\nDiminish the heart’s affairs, let things be.\nThe spirit palace moves the true three treasures,\nThe sevenfold return fuses the bone-transforming elixir.\n\n**For Lin, Section Chief of Wudi County**\nDiminish disputation, conceal brilliance, the Dao arises of itself,\nInwardly still the true encounter, the numinous spirit luminous.\nQi and spirit conjoin, returning to the original sea,\nSilent and formless, emerging from form.\n\n**For Xu, Chief Clerk of Putai**\nPreserve the essence’s splendor, the marrow’s sand,\nDraw the tiger, harmonize the dragon, nurture the auspicious sprout.\nThe formless treasure vase gathers crystal fire,\nThe four greats in harmony tread mist and rosy clouds.\n\n**For Little Xie of Dengzhou, Ill, Sent with This**\nYou must frequently sip the healing broth,\nFilled with poverty’s joy, free of sorrow.\nWhen bitter causes are exhausted, heaven opens its eyes,\nBy fate, you will slowly hear the immortal path’s fragrance.\n\n**Exhorting the Assembly of Daoists**\nWiden the belly to propagate the great teaching,\nUnfurl the heart-moon to revolve the void.\nLet a single point of emptiness rise and fall as it will,\nNot striking the wheel of rebirth, there is no center.\n\n**For Liu Congzhen**\nCultivating the real through kalpas, kalpa upon kalpa,\nAccumulating mysterious merit, attaining the shore’s boat.\nGreat aspiration pierces the heavens, no obstacle too firm,\nGradually the immortal path opens, leisurely and free.\n\n**For the Dao Companion of Shahe**\nThe wondrous Dao’s true emptiness fills the world,\nThe mundane stream fails to recognize the returned elixir.\nEstablishing the body and nature through

      "translated_text": "**For Liu Siguan of Putai**\nYour official blessings and virtue already stand lofty and pure,\nYet you further grasp the cloud-root to fortify the firm foundation.\nFire courses beneath the sea, water ascends to heaven,\nTiger and dragon unite in congress—ranked among the immortal hosts.\n\n**For the Assembly at Lulü Mountain**\nO assembly of Lulü, sink not into obscurity,\nInwardly illumine the Three Lights, nurturing the candle of nature.\nTrue transformation arises spontaneously, free from suffering and calamity,\nThe precious flower reaches fullness, ascending to heaven’s embrace.\n\n**Caution**\nFrom youth I admired the pure and void, soft and yielding,\nUnconcerned with worldly paths, I sought no trace or reason.\nOnly the dread of birth and death, with no gate to escape,\nI leaned alone on empty mountains, seeking the ultimate truth.\n\n**Encountering the Master**\nSuddenly I heard of a lofty Daoist arriving in the mountain prefecture,\nThe Three Teachings interlinked, I searched along one path.\nThe myriad dharmas and worldly dust were utterly extinguished,\nIn grass robes and wooden bowls, I契d with true cultivation.\n\n**Taking the Master as Teacher**\nPredestined affinity, heart-to-heart exchange—once met, all was resolved,\nMaster and disciple, having realized the truth, need not tarry in words.\nIn the Jade Hall, we gathered in the patience of non-arising,\nThe mystery’s mechanism concealed, we smiled and nodded.\n\n**Expressing Aspirations (Two Poems)**\nThe great Dao originally transmits not a single dharma,\nAwakened, I clap my hands and point to the azure sky.\nThe numinous nature secretly merges with the void,\nOnly then do I perceive radiance filling the great thousand.\n\nTransformation gives birth to the heavenly Dao, freely and unfettered,\nIn the mysterious valley, auspicious omens dance the *liuma*.\nDaily cycles purify the cosmos,\nRealizing that from level ground one ascends to the azure heavens.\n\n**On the Twenty-Second Day of the Twelfth Month, Fasting and Recalling Danyang**\nThe mysterious light surges, the cosmos emptied,\nA single grain of the great elixir intoxicates the cloud-capped peak.\nToday my immortal brother ascends to the origin,\nThe painted image at Changyang reveals his wondrous traces.\n\n**Responding to the Invitation of Chaoyuan Gong in Cangzhou (Two Poems)**\nThe Yellow River overflows, inundating all directions,\nLiving beings everywhere suffer its ravages.\nI hasten to the Chaoyuan assembly to converse,\nUrging the swift practice of the Yellow Register to supplicate the vault of heaven.\n\nA solitary heart, a single point, forges bonds of knowing,\nBeyond the world, my pure name grows ever more exalted.\nWhen the inner elixir’s radiance fills to the full,\nThe Dao perfected, the ancestral master emerges from the heavenly hosts.\n\n**Upon Perfecting the Work**\nThe great elixir’s radiance fills, naturally piercing the heavens,\nI guard this provisional body, awaiting the sage’s summons.\nAbove the Three Realms, the Jade Emperor calls.\nExternally, I relieve the suffering of the ten directions and Three Realms,\nInternally, I pay homage to the supreme Great Luo Immortals.\n\n**Sending the *Yunzhong Record* and This Poem to Lady Jinzi**\nPure tones and wondrous conduct, no private melodies,\nEven a drop of water’s grace is hard to forget.\nSecretly, I ascend the immortal palace to the purple thoroughfare,\nMy name preordained in the *Yunzhong Record*.\n\n**For Wang Miaozhen’s Request**\nThe Dao advances bone-deep, ceaselessly,\nIn stillness, I often encounter the numinous, alert.\nCultivating the hundred practices without deviation,\nAlone I dance the fetal immortal, feasting in the Jade Court.\n\n**For Zhang Ge of Taiyuan on Gathering the Heart**\nHeart arises, heart ceases—let the heart rest,\nGather the radiance upon the heart with utmost care.\nHeart and nature, lucidly one,\nThe great Dao of emptiness naturally rounds itself.\n\n**For the Daoist Assembly**\nHaving realized the heart, true cultivation manifests beyond it,\nDaring to sweep away the red dust with a single brush.\nSearching the original source, the pure sovereign,\nTogether we ride the great divine vessel of the Dharma sea.\n\n**For Xu Gong’s Request for Healing**\nYesterday, today, and the morrow,\nHasten the wheel of rebirth, summoning fortune and misfortune.\nBetter to settle the heart in constant silence,\nTimely nurturing the jade zhi sprouts.\n\n**For Hu Siweng of Putai (Two Poems)**\nThe primordial Dao, minutely and exquisitely sought,\nThe entire body’s radiance flows above and below.\nHaving refined and perfected it, you encounter deliverance,\nThen ride the cinnabar phoenix to Yingzhou.\n\nFilial piety without disobedience harmonizes with heaven,\nFurther, burn heart-incense to penetrate bone and flesh.\nRescuing the yin prisoners from suffering and calamity,\nSincerity naturally receives the Dao’s support.\n\n**For Wang Ge of Juzhou (Two Poems)**\nA single qi stealthily pervades the myriad transformations’ glory,\nFilling the void, it scatters the light purple haze.\nGrasping the true heart-medicine of heaven and earth,\nClapping the void to pieces, the Dao forms itself.\n\nImmortal tones, resonant, issue from Dongting,\nOsmanthus fragrance diffuses, filling the void with scent.\nTo rejuvenate countenance and transform substance, no other matter,\nHaving ingested the *daogui*, it is naturally efficacious.\n\n**Exhorting Liu San to Establish Himself**\nThe Dao of humans and heaven makes self-establishment difficult,\nDo not consort with the fierce and perverse in your comings and goings.\nThe hundred practices do not depart from the true filial Dao,\nUnenlightened, it is as if separated by ten thousand barriers.\n\n**For Lu Huishou of Laizhou (Two Poems)**\nThe lotus palace of Penglai, no birth to rely upon,\nFrom the beginning, how does a single thing attain numinosity?\nThe three fields and nine tripods, their radiance hard to gather,\nHow could the seven-jeweled golden countenance be seen?\n\nBone-penetrating, flowing radiance, the heart-moon’s fragrance,\nThe heart’s fragrance flows forth, congealing true auspiciousness.\nThe three disasters and five sufferings scatter with the wind,\nA hundred refinements of harmonious qi, cool day and night.\n\n**For Ma Daweng’s Request**\nSupporting the inner teaching, the numinous stirs,\nThe five-colored golden lotus, leaf upon leaf, flourishes.\nDaily, I depart from all suffering and calamity,\nThe Dao’s sprout and immortal blessings naturally arise.\n\n**For Chaoyuan Gong’s Request**\nBlack waters and red clouds transform and deliver the true,\nSurging through blood and vessels, benefiting the spirit.\nDragon and serpent coil, radiance gathers,\nThe white horse neighs, the body beyond the body.\n\n**For the Daoist Assembly at Sanbao Hermitage in Zhaoyuan (Two Poems)**\nThe Three Treasures’ splendor emerges from the earth,\nIn darkness, the old form is exchanged.\nImmortal wind and Daoist bones, dignified and refined,\nWith destiny to ascend the origin, stepping the jade stairs.\n\nDo not violate the nation’s laws, nor deceive the heart,\nThe Three Treasures’ radiance naturally illumines.\nRecognizing the original, formless thing,\nA single wheel, round and radiant, emerges from the jade peak.\n\n**For Xu Gong’s Request for an Oral Formula**\nThe sun sets west of the mountain, life and destiny wither,\nHasten to cultivate, hasten to refine, apply effort.\nWith an ashen heart, gradually attain agelessness,\nYin exhausted, yang pure—the medicine in one furnace.\n\n**Xia Wuzhen’s Realization**\nThe original face opens toward the heart,\nBlack and white, the golden essence, all are refined and returned.\nThe cycle of inversion, the true firing times,\nFrom nothingness, spontaneously, the infant is born.\n\n**For Pang Ge’s Discussion of the Dao**\nA lump of unrefined ore, never polished,\nSnowy blade and icy edge speak of honey’s sweetness.\nThe foul and rotting skin-bag—call it “not two,”\nThe rank and filthy viscera—make them heaven’s harmony.\n\n**For Zhang Wudao of Jinan’s Request**\nNot in frequent questioning of Yuyang,\nEach must search their own life and destiny in detail.\nThe immortal medicine of the mysterious palace, the origin-attaining formula,\nThe heart-pearl of the Dharma sea, the Dao-perfecting method.\n\n**Mockery from Outsiders**\nIn Deng, Lai, and Weifang, they falsely praise,\nYet the awakened and wise reside within.\nDaily, I advance in true cultivation of the great Dao,\nUniversally proclaiming the teaching, filling all directions.\n\n**For Liu Daweng of Hu Village in Muping**\nMoment by moment, apply intent, examine in detail,\nNo friend of the heart surpasses choosing the good.",

Karma**\nKarma spans three lifetimes, sins and grievances run deep—\nHasten to cultivate the true, take heed with care.\nDisasters vanish beneath the Nine Yin, false externals dissolve,\nFortune arises on the Ten Grounds, good affinities draw near.\n\n**For Zhou Bao, Inquiring About the Time of Birth**\nPreserve life and refine the gold within water,\nFling forth divine radiance, profound in wondrous practice.\nEmbrace the One without departure, clarify true awakening,\nThe Nine Yangs converge, all yin is dispelled.\n\n**Two Self-Composed Verses**\nBeyond the world, in pure leisure, I know contentment,\nThe heart’s completion ascends heaven’s ladder.\nThe numinous treasure of emptiness reveals its perfect light,\nIlluminating the dim crossroads, never to stray again.\n\nTeachings bring joy, one layer upon another,\nThe causes of Dharma assemblies gradually unfold.\nDevotees come and go without cease,\nPassing the transmission, expounding true emptiness.\n\n**For Gongge’s Request**\nThe jade tripod and golden furnace refine the Dao’s sprout,\nA small immortal’s art overturns past and present.\nMyriad spirits gather toward the path of no-birth,\nOne day, with merit complete, Penglai’s isles will boast.\n\n**For Sun Daweng, Custodian of the Stone Shrine in Laiyang**\nTownsfolk never cease offering fragrant incense,\nPraying for blessings, entreating auspicious words.\nAncient immortals left traces here of old,\nDrawing people to ascend and gaze toward the immortal realm.\n\n**For Daoist Companions**\nEach year on the third day of the third lunar month,\nSacred waters gather the noble and grand.\nOn this day, Daoist companions request teachings—\nThus I compose.\n\nSacred waters on the third of the third convene the esteemed,\nSincere in prayer for blessings, undeterred by toil.\nConcerned for life and death, we discuss and inquire together,\nExpounding the great causal conditions, transforming all once more.\n\n**For Li Daweng, Who in Old Age Spoke of Past Errors in Cultivation**\nWishing to graft anew the withered root,\nWorldly affairs turn the heart to ashes.\nFormer perverse qi departs the body,\nBoundless divine radiance enters the belly.\n\n**Two Poems in Thanks to Wang Liuweng for Fragrant Tea**\nDeeply grateful for your gift of fine fragrant tea,\nTogether we vow to nurture the auspicious sprout with distant light.\nA single thunderclap divides creation,\nJade nectar and liquid jasper irrigate cinnabar sand.\n\nThree cycles have turned since I last visited old friends,\nEight or nine of ten—how sorrowful to behold.\nLuminous waters shimmer, resplendent and bright,\nThe Dao’s transformation renews itself day by day.\n\n**Sent to Master Qiu of Changchun**\nBody and mind, within and without, bind true auspiciousness,\nThe profound teachings, dim and distant, penetrate to the bone’s chill.\nMortal and sage share a single source—true joy,\nThe boundless expanse of humans and heavens bestows immortal methods.\n\n**For the Inner Clan’s County Deputy**\nA meritorious minister, the inner clan’s standards pure and lofty,\nBoundless heavenly grace bestowed alike.\nFilial piety and virtue both complete—few can compare,\nOne day in the forest’s shade, seek the immortal court.\n\n**For Attendant Chen**\nFrom ancient times to now, laws are not to be betrayed,\nThought after thought, selflessly expounding the true lineage.\nClarify the original source, the pure sovereign,\nEffortlessly behold the wind of one’s own family.\n\n**Two Poems for the Ritual Request in Fushan**\nMaster Changchun’s high recommendation arrives,\nHasten to respond, spared further urging.\nOfficials and townsfolk converse together,\nYet who has unlocked the mind-seal’s mystery?\n\nIn my hometown, devotees pass the word along,\nPetitions and renowned gentlemen form auspicious bonds.\nFilial sons and obedient grandsons together offer blessings,\nNewly departed, distant transformations—all ascend to heaven.\n\n**For Scholar Song**\nOnce you cast the hook to angle for the great leviathan,\nStirring the vast sea, roiling with furious waves.\nIf only there is affinity to meet and aid,\nNone who follow fail to join the immortal court.\n\n**Admonition to a Young Novice Leaving Home**\nFirst, you must draw near to those of virtuous conduct,\nCherish the advance of the Dao, spare no toil.\nContend in merit, vie in practice, uphold from beginning to end,\nOnly then can you connect with the numinous and awaken to your original truth.\n\n**For Gao Wanhu of Fushan, Summoned for Northern Campaign**\nDevoted and loyal, exhausting strength, unleashing mighty prowess,\nA single charge shatters the frontier pass, displaying great merit.\nThe rivers and mountains restored to the sagely lord,\nPraise and renown resound throughout the realm.\n\n**For the Newly Departed from Wen and Mu**\nNews of pure tones fills the homeland,\nThe Dharma assembly in Wen and Mu flourishes ever more.\nPassing along, they propagate the principle of true emptiness,\nThe seven-jeweled golden lotus fragrance spreads everywhere.\n\n**For Wang Yuzhen of Guanzxi, Receiving the Precepts from Master Danyang**\nThe precepts bestowed upon Wang Yuzhen of Guanzxi,\nRely on wondrous principles to nurture the numinous root.\nWith affinity, cling to the true teacher’s model,\nGeneration after generation, the virtue of the Dao flows on.\n\n**For Little Cui of Wendeng, Whose Parents Consent to Leave Home but Do Not Release Him**\nLeaving home brings blessings to both sides,\nYet stubborn ignorance does not exhaust the heart.\nA single trace of worldly sentiment remains unsevered,\nThus violating heaven’s Dao, the root of sin runs deep.\n\n**Fundraising for the Three Clarities’ Warm Curtains at This Abode**\nRenovation requires the convergence of many conditions,\nThus we establish fields of blessing among the people.\nWishing further to turn the light inward, seeking the subtle and wondrous,\nOnly then will inner and outer winds be universally complete.\n\n**For Director Yang**\nDirector Yang, with utmost devotion, holds the Dao’s thought deep,\nIn the teaching’s gate, he has a share—knowing the tone.\nAdding to spirit, supplementing life, radiance gathers,\nRetreating from ambition, forsaking the rest—calamity will surely come.\n\n**Two Poems Seeking Teachings in the Chan Gate**\nTrue Chan, true Dao—give rise to true merit,\nTrue goodness, true compassion—true suffering, true emptiness.\nTrue joy, true leisure—true ease,\nTrue cultivation, true refinement—revealing the true wind.\n\nTrue heart, true attainment—true delight,\nStraightforward practice of true merit, making one cluster.\nTrue awakening, true mystery—true clarity,\nTrue emptiness, true transformation—eternally true peace.\n\n**This Abode’s Letter Urging Return Home**\nThe conditions elsewhere are rich, the return delayed,\nEverywhere the causes run deep, the departure slow.\nIn general, it does not depart from propagating the teaching,\nThis body’s movements and pauses submit to the flow.\n\n**Two Mid-Autumn Poems**\nIn the eighth month’s mid-autumn, day and night grow cool,\nRevolving and returning—this is the original true constant.\nHeaven and earth open, the flawless treasure,\nA single qi, clear and serene, reveals Yuyang.\n\nAutumn clouds disperse, the azure sky clears,\nA single cold light arises within the sea.\nIlluminating through the jade pot, divine brilliance coalesces,\nThe three fields flow and circulate, naturally perfecting themselves.\n\n**Completing the True**\nHaving completed the true, one becomes a Great Luo immortal,\nYet still inquires among people to universally transform and gather.\nSeeking the leviathan to present to the Emperor,\nShaking the floating world, descending with weighty proclamation.\n\n**For Master Zhang, Who Sent Fermented Sauce**\nYin and yang’s essence and refinement emit divine radiance,\nAttaining the method, harmonizing—one flavor endures.\nUniversally exhorting the world to follow this way,\nIf consumed, one remains forever cool and clear.\n\n**For Master Zheng**\nWorldly entanglements, things upon things—do not exhaustively pursue,\nA thousand kinds of use and expenditure are all ultimately empty.\nSearching the true source, the pure sovereign,\nSuddenly, one still sees the wind of one’s own family.",

      "translated_text": "**For Qiu, Wang, Jiao, and Three Unruly Boys**\n\nA sudden wild impulse seeks to leave the home,\nFoolish and stubborn, years pass in vain.\nWhy so unruly, so hard to tame?\nAll stems from roots where fortune never came.\n\n**Three Poems for Magistrate Chen of Gu County**\n\nAll dharmas are empty—do not guess in vain,\nFrom the primal origin, a speck beyond all dust.\nLike a lotus rising pure from water’s face,\nIts subtle fragrance drifts from far away.\n\nThe Dao transforms the Three Powers: heaven, earth, and man,\nWho can grasp the root and restore the true?\nDo not waste in humble dwellings, aging in vain,\nBegin the work to perfect the self beyond the self.\n\nTo transcend the world and ascend the true is not hard,\nWith all ties unobstructed, the belly grows vast.\nThe Three Palaces circulate the elixir of years,\nThe Seven Treasures refine the pill that remolds the bones.\n\n**For Master Zheng of Mount Lao**\n\nSteadfast in will, serene in heart, dwelling on Mount Lao’s peak,\nBeneath the flowering canopy, immortals of old refined the great elixir.\nCountless ridges and peaks lie deep in shadow,\nNaturally, worldly affairs do not intrude.\n\n**For the Wife of the Surveillance Commissioner, Seeking Teaching Due to Illness**\n\nFrom ancient times, birth and nurture follow the Dao’s constant way,\nYet how can people all turn from this path?\nNot cherishing the original, pure sovereign within,\nHow can this colored body ever know peace and health?\n\n**Twelve Poems Expressing My Heart**\n\nThe formless Great Dao gave birth to me,\nIts mysterious principle flows from Kunlun’s height.\nThe Three Lights pour forth their true radiance,\nA single blazing qi transforms jade-like yang.\n\nNon-being and being—Dao’s eternal truth,\nEach step through fragrant flowers spans the ten directions.\nGreat awakening fills heaven and earth with numinous light,\nIn motion, stillness, sitting, lying—behold the Three Lights.\n\nA speck of numinous light opens within the void,\nComing and going in emptiness, no wheel of rebirth.\nEmbracing sun and moon, it links past and present,\nNameless and primal, it moves as it will.\n\nThrough kalpas vast, its radiance stands unmoved,\nEmbodying heaven, following the Dao—non-action’s way.\nNaturally, it refines the true Three Treasures,\nGiving birth to heaven and earth, all transformations hang.\n\nSuddenly, harmonious qi sprouts the Dao’s shoot,\nGradually, true qi congeals into cinnabar.\nThe Three Powers and Four Images reverse their course,\nThen you know Penglai is your true home.\n\nBearing such numinous things, the body rests in truth,\nGrasping round brightness, recognizing the inner face.\nThe primordial spirit leaps beyond creation,\nLightly striking through the Three Passes.\n\nFormless radiance illumines the inner truth,\nBefore heaven and earth, it sets the good cause.\nWith a pure heart, the gods and spirits meet,\nA single golden elixir emerges from the six dusts.\n\nLeaping beyond the wheel of creation,\nTrue sages fill the empty sky, arrayed in clouds.\nThe ten directions and three realms await your roaming,\nWith each step, celestial light rolls the jade altar.\n\nRecognizing the primal speck of numinous light,\nNo cultivation, no action—no birth to complete.\nMerging with the Great Dao’s true emptiness,\nStep by step, carefree, you ascend to Jade Capital.\n\nThe sea of awakened origin gathers the spirits,\nAll things return to one transformative birth.\nTo restore the root and return to the sea of awakening,\nWith non-action’s work complete, you naturally achieve perfection.\n\nRadiant light gathers around the numinous spirit,\nA thousand-petaled golden lotus blooms beneath your feet.\nEscaping the suffering of the ten directions and three realms,\nWithout effort, you perfect yourself.\n\nAwakening to truth, penetrating the root, wisdom’s root opens,\nThe alchemy of sincerity expounds suffering and emptiness.\nPrajna-paramita—no hindrance,\nThe subtle and imperceptible Great Dao is wholly fused.\n\nTreasure-light fulfilled, desires wither,\nAll floating splendor fades like an empty glance.\nRefining the golden elixir without calculation,\nWhere among immortals is there not thusness?\n\n**Inscribed on the Stone Bridge of Weizhou**\n\nSeven apertures exquisitely meet the jade spring,\nThe Dharma Bridge’s vast passage—I am the same.\nWho can fathom the shifting of past and present?\nFor the sake of those in the world with karmic affinity.\n\n**Facing the Moon**\n\nWithin the realm of true emptiness, the azure sky appears,\nThe precious mirror never wavers.\nIf you grasp this as body and function,\nThen you know the spirit’s nature is inherently luminous.\n\n**Two Poems Inscribed on Yun’guang Cave**\n\nLong ago in Yun’guang, the great elixir was refined,\nOnce completed, in an instant, youthful countenance returned.\nAbove, entreating the Lord of Heaven through kalpas vast,\nBelow, delivering beings from the wheel of birth and death.\n\nSun and moon fly in exchange, shooting forth purple mist,\nClear and void, bright and boundless, piercing the ends of the sky.\nOpening the Dao-eye, few can recognize,\nSuddenly, you realize Penglai is your home.\n\n**For Disciple Han Daowen, Who Returned to His Hometown to Issue Public Documents**\n\nGolden flowers and jade buds form the spirit-embryo,\nWith unwavering resolve and pure strength, a separate stage.\nThe golden bones refine open the true jade nature,\nTransforming into formless birth, never buried.\n\n**For the Two Elders, Mu and Liu, of Fushan and Moucheng**\n\nA speck of true emptiness—no place to guess,\nEach plants the magic mushroom within the heart.\nAll around, golden lotus seeds are sown,\nNaturally, in due time, the Dao-eye opens.\n\n**For Disciple Wang Shouzheng**\n\nLight bones restore youth, standing at the origin,\nPure tones and wondrous conduct reach the limitless.\nReturning to the origin, a speck opens true nature,\nThe spirit leaps forth, dazzling the Great Void.\n\n**For Li Zhiquan, Dwelling in White Dragon Cave**\n\nThe white dragon enters the belly, transforming birth,\nMyriad celestial lights open the kalpa’s vastness.\nSun and moon rise and set before your eyes,\nSitting, you clearly glimpse Penglai.\n\n**Farewell to the Officials and People of Yutian County**\n\nIn the *gengwu* year, the Master was in Yutian County of Jizhou. After the ritual concluded, he addressed the crowd: \"The Dao’s qi of the north is about to return. In the empty sky, spirits and deities come and go, clashing blades and striking—surely the people are about to suffer.\" He composed a poem to bid farewell to the officials and people. Soon after, the northern frontier saw turmoil.\n\nThe Great Dao’s radiance turns as one,\nCloud formations in ten directions, stars in swift flight.\nHeaven and earth display their true signs,\nWorldly affairs and floating splendor—mere specks of ash.\n\n**Lamenting the World**\n\nWorldly beings do not awaken to the Dao’s root,\nBorn and transformed in heaven and earth, responding to things’ mechanisms.\nGrasping this subtle and wondrous essence,\nNaturally, spirit and qi reach the profound and minute.\n\n**Two Poems for the Thousand-Household of Juzhou**\n\nA single stick of heart-incense reaches Supreme Clarity,\nThe wondrous Dao of non-action gradually achieves perfection.\nHanging high, the precious mirror—dust cannot obscure,\nIlluminating the path ahead, bright through ten thousand kalpas.\n\nFrom the void, a single qi gives birth,\nHeaven and earth, yin and yang, form the embryo of excellence.\nThrough kalpas vast, the true visage transcends creation,\nIn the azure sky, phenomena hang free of the slightest dust.\n\n**Two Poems Inviting the Assembly to Bathe in the Southern Stream of Sacred Water Cave**\n\nAll should go to the bathing pool,\nShedding worldly dust, dissolving delusion and doubt.\nEach holds fast to purity and clarity for cultivation,\nThrough a thousand ages, thus and unmoved.\n\n**For the Assembly, Washing Away Filth**\n\nThe great assembly should all go to bathe,\nStripping away defilement, ending confusion.\nEach with refined spirit, engage in refinement,\nEternally thus, never shifting.",
      "overlap_context": "ho Sent Fermented Sauce**\nYin and yang’s essence and refinement emit divine radiance,\nAttaining the method, harmonizing—one flavor endures.\nUniversally exhorting the world to follow this way,\nIf consumed, one remains forever cool and clear.\n\n**For Master Zheng**\nWorldly entanglements, things upon things—do not exhaustively pursue,\nA thousand kinds of use and expenditure are all ultimately empty.\nSearching the true source, the pure sovereign,\nSuddenly, one still sees the wind of one’s own family.",

      "translated_text": "When emerging from the bath, freed from filth and radiant,\nEach person reveals a form without the slightest blemish.\nWashing clean within and without, body and mind purified,\nA single point of true emptiness follows every step.\n\n**Proceeding to the Mountain for the Offering Ritual**\nFrom the bitter sea’s ceaseless toil, escape is hard,\nYet where truth is realized, incense altars spread.\nClimbing mountains, fording streams, no complaint is voiced,\nTo deliver the living and the dead—this vow is vast.\n\n**In Gratitude for Magistrate Gong’s Gift of Peppermint Pills from Guozhou**\nA single elixir, like ambrosia poured upon the crown,\nRevives a thousand ages’ finest countenance.\nFragrant essence, vibrant and spiritually bright,\nPierces the wheel of rebirth, breaking the gate of life and death.\n\n**Non-Contention**\nFrom ancient times to now, how many changes have there been?\nYet none escape arising and ceasing—true accord lies in non-contention.\nFew indeed awaken to non-contention’s truth,\nBut once grasped, the Dao is instantly fulfilled.\n\n**Three Poems for the Divine Youth**\nA single, unwavering heart from beginning to end in leaving home,\nA luminous body shines through past and present.\nGradually penetrating the spirit-terrace, surging past the crown,\nReturning to the wondrous Dao—rare are those who understand.\n\nA radiant jade flame, a single elixir pill,\nAll emerge from the heart-field, gateway to myriad transformations.\nCompleting immortal merit, mastering the Dao’s path,\nSerenely seated on Red City Mountain in perfect peace.\n\nBreath harmonized, all transformations flow freely,\nTrue emptiness emerges beyond being and non-being.\nMysteriously aligned with virtue and the Dao’s eternal principle,\nAll rests within the towering nature of the One.\n\n**Parting from Dengzhou**\nClouds gather, mist unfurls—a fine time for leisurely wandering,\nHaving entered perfection, now the cycle begins anew.\nThe Great Heavenly Net’s true guidance is clear,\nThus, with this understanding, I depart from Dengzhou.\n\n**Two Poems for Li, Vice-Director of Laizhou, Who Contemplates Leaving the World**\nShedding the mundane, delving into the profound—this you know well,\nFrom the very beginning, a single point aligns with heaven’s mechanism.\nWithin my gate lies the secret of immortal cultivation,\nWill you, Master Xianwu, follow or not?\n\nBearing witness to the Three Treasures as your life’s work,\nHeaven and earth’s harmonious qi nurtures the sun’s essence.\nWorldly fame and achievement—all thoughts abandoned,\nWhen the numinous frost congeals into purple-gold cinnabar.\n\n**For the Vice-Prefect of This Prefecture, Seeking Atractylodes**\nFashioned from the radiance of sun and moon’s flowing light,\nIt replenishes flesh and bone, gradually making them light and pure.\nAble to gather the four seasons’ spiritual luminosity,\nIt seizes the immortal elixir, giving rise to wondrous transformations.\n\n**Matching a Poem by Zhang, Palace Examination Graduate**\nMy resolve, sharp as a blade, severs the dust of ten thousand concerns,\nTrue practice and true merit enrich creation’s bounty.\nRefining the precious pearl, I transcend the world’s snares,\nRoaming freely in the Great Heavenly Realm.\n\n**For the Female Assembly in the Hall of Cultivation**\nRegardless of age, engage in true cultivation,\nEach unfurls the tranquil oar to reach the other shore.\nLight fills the ten directions, free from suffering and distress,\nDwelling forever beyond the heavens—most refined.\n\n**Admonishing Disciples to Examine the Mind-Ground**\nWith mind and eyes serene, examine within,\nAmid the clutter of worldly affairs, discern true auspiciousness.\nGathering spirit and nurturing qi—this is merit and practice,\nLet worldly matters, one and all, take their short or long course.\n\n**For Guo, Licentiate of Wenshan, Seeking the Elixir**\nIf you seek the bone-transforming elixir of long life,\nSwiftly cast aside worldly concerns and set the mind at ease.\nIn stillness, recognize the true message,\nAnd break free from the wheel of rebirth, the gate of life and death.\n\n**For Song Shaoweng of Chashan, Who Donated Scriptures for the Offering Ritual**\nEstablishing the fast, teaching the rites, and copying sacred texts,\nRemoving sins and transgressions—there is sure reliance.\nUniversally aiding the departed with the Dao’s power,\nAll escape karmic suffering and attain liberation.\n\n**Emptiness and Being**\nEthereal clouds and mist—emptiness upon emptiness,\nThe inner master of heaven’s Dao is the source’s root.\nYet clinging to emptiness, one is still obscured by emptiness,\nWhile following being, one is again veiled by being.\n\n**Lamenting Delusion**\nEast to west, seeking the true explanation,\nYet one’s own numinous clarity remains incomplete.\nThe ten thousand dharmas and conditions are like ten thousand images,\nKnow that all are but a single heaven.\n\n**For Master Yang of Dace**\nA single point of non-arising merges with the boundless,\nNurturing harmony’s light through conception and transformation.\nWith deep karmic affinity, awakening to the Quanzhen truth,\nThe fragrance of the Dharma-Dao spreads everywhere.\n\n**On Disciples’ Silence**\nThe hundred practices pivot on the five constants,\nThe teaching of non-speech fills the void with fragrance.\nQuietly observing the true and wondrous mystery,\nIn stillness and obscurity, the principle runs deepest.\n\n**Remembering the Two Masters Song of Laiyang**\nThe crane’s chariot and cloud carriage—no word comes,\nWhen will they return to the Jade Void?\nBy the pine window, rain passes, zither and books are quiet,\nAll day long, no one to speak of the original teaching.\n\n**Exhorting the Practice of Filial Piety**\nWith a single heart, filial piety aligns with the three luminaries,\nThrough bitter resolve and diligent refinement, old misfortunes are erased.\nFrom ancient times to now, all delusion and demonic forces are extinguished,\nRefining truth, shedding falsehood, transforming into cool purity.\n\n**After the Ritual in This Prefecture, for Fellow Daoist Friends**\nBy noble command, we were invited to this prefecture,\nThe ritual feast prepared, vast and all-encompassing.\nWith sincere resolve, accumulating true merit and virtue,\nTogether we journey to Penglai, gazing upon the ten isles.\n\n**After the Ritual for the Thousand-Household Official of Mizhou, Who Invited Me as the Yellow Register Master of Salvation**\nPure integrity and filial piety startle gods and spirits,\nSupplicating the myriad heavens, gathering the ten thousand spirits.\nSacred water and sweet unguent universally bestowed,\nSunken souls and lingering spirits emerge from dark nether realms.\n\n**For the Officials and Merchants of Mizhou Who Sponsored the Restoration of Youde Abbey**\nReviving Youde is no difficult task,\nForeseeing harmonious qi already returning in cycles.\nFrom beginning to end, unwavering—merit perfected,\nWith a share in the immortal ranks, ascending to the upper echelons.\n\n**Exhorting the Assembly to Engage in Cultivation**\nJoin forces, unite hearts—do not complain of hardship,\nRevive the blessed land, convene the immortal altar.\nVying in merit and practice, ascending through the cloud ranks,\nWherever the eye falls, selflessly, the elixir silently forms.\n\n**For Li, Captain of Mizhou**\nMaster Captain wearies of worldly dust,\nWith cinnabar sincerity and protective virtue, forging good causes.\nIn this, offerings and provisions are amply provided,\nFortune and blessings have always been bestowed upon the auspicious.\n\n**Lamenting Those Who Have Yet to Awaken**\nTen thousand kinds of beings in the bitter sea,\nAlas, who will establish immortal merit?\nFortunately, the Quanzhen truth points the way,\nWherever you cultivate, the Dao is fulfilled in unity.\n\n**After the Ritual for the Various Princes, Addressing the Assembly**\nFormless and non-acting—a single point of truth,\nUniversally offering homage to the Great Heavenly Honored One.\nThe myriad spirits rejoice, receiving liberation,\nEmerging from the prison of yin and the five sufferings’ gate.\n\n**Instructing Disciples**\nLight suffuses the body, illuminating the chamber,\nA perfect wheel of radiance, without waning or waxing.\nOnly then do you know this is the true primordial ancestor,\nForever freed from sinking and rising, responding to transformations.\n\n**For Cui Daochang of Mizhou, Who Fiercely Left the World**\nAbandoning the mundane, entering the profound, awakening to the constant Dao,\nTurning the heart to protect the inner light.\nRefining open the ancient true numinous nature,\nImmortal blossoms unfading, their fragrance everywhere.\n\n**Answering a Question on the Three Treasures**\nOf old, the Three Treasures—qi, spirit, and essence,\nAll gather in the primordial field, each with its own cause.\nWhen light fills the ten directions and the elixir is complete,\nIn the Great Heavenly Realm, the immortals take their place.",

scenery.\n\n**Those Who Follow Heaven Prosper**\nGood deeds are like mountains,\nDiligently cultivated with constant effort.\nEstablishing oneself in the great Dao,\nThe dharma-nature naturally harmonizes.\n\n**Those Who Defy Heaven Perish**\nCunning and lazy, scheming with guile,\nStubborn emotions defy heaven’s will.\nTrue harm to the teachings,\nBitter karmic ties to hell.\n\n**Transcending the Dust**\nA single speck of true suchness,\nDwelling in the dust yet unstained.\nThe original substance of emptiness,\nUnfettered, transcending heaven and humanity.\n\n**A Chant [Warning]**\nOnce, in Gusui Village of Muping County,\nI expounded the teachings, revealing heaven’s secrets.\nThe entire household knelt to listen,\nYet all were as deaf.\nSeeing that Elder Chi’s lifespan was short,\nI warned him with these words:\nDo not trifle with the Yellow Springs,\nCherish your whole being within.\nDefying heaven brings a hundred calamities,\nAttaining the Dao moves ten thousand spirits.\n\n**Declining Gifts of Robes, Horses, and Saddle from Officials in the Capital**\nTo escape the suffering of birth, old age, sickness, and death,\nI urge you to cultivate the ascent to immortality.\nForget emotions, sever worldly ties,\nAll transformations return to the original master.\n\n**For Master Chaoyuan**\nMaster Chaoyuan, Liu, devoted to the Dao with utmost sincerity,\nHas bestowed boundless kindness.\nThrough this chant, I seek\nTo stir the heart that transcends the dust:\nTo seek the cause of longevity, quiet the mind;\nTo comprehend the Dao of nature, sweep away distractions.\nTo cultivate the true field of blessings and aid others,\nTo support affinities, propagate the teachings, and harmonize with light.\n\n**Wang of Tai’an Prefecture Announces His Entire Family’s Entry into the Dao**\nRemarkable, Wang and his whole family,\nEach nurturing the root of purity.\nStriving to escape the path of death,\nRefining and stewing the essence of sun and moon.\n\n**Expressing My Feelings**\nOnce, I humbly guarded the Dao,\nNow, the true sage’s retribution arrives.\nMy name inscribed in the Jade Record of the Great Luo,\nLater learners, hasten to cultivate immortality.\n\n**Requested by Lu Xuanwu**\nSince the Dao’s inception,\nThe formless has transformed all things.\nViewing self and others as one,\nReflect inward to deepen the root and firm the stem.\n\n**Losing a Horse While Spreading the Teachings in Botai County, Sent to Master Chaoyuan for Consideration**\nThe lost horse, an empty transformation,\nYet I hope for Chaoyuan’s refined grace.\nWith joy, embody the subtle workings of immortality,\nAnother auspicious phoenix awaits a steady ride.\n\n**For the Seventh Imperial Son-in-Law, Defender of Dizhou**\nBound by official duties,\nYet learning to govern the emptiness of the Dao.\nThe four classes busy with their crafts,\nThe enlightened disregard length or brevity.\n\n**For Ma Wuzhen**\nWuzhen has wholly shed falsity,\nTethering the monkey-mind and horse-will.\nIn the treasure palace, tiger and dragon coil,\nRed phoenix and blue simurgh ride steady.\n\n**Requested by Ma Zhizhen**\nInternal refinement allows transformation,\nA single qi harmonizing above and below.\nTranscending the dust, recognizing perfect clarity,\nConversing in the bright moon and clear wind.\n\n**To the Daoist Assembly in Dongxiang**\nI bow to the eastern method assembly,\nThe Dao’s essence lies in unwavering sincerity.\nEach harbors a single-minded devotion,\nIlluminating all conditions without obscurity.\n\n**Composed Upon Being Slandered by the Young**\nYoung ones with sharp lips and quick tongues,\nUnwilling to distinguish right before others.\nAll because they extinguish right and wrong,\nThus they escape birth and death.\nThrough these encounters with three summons,\nI walk alone in the clear wind and bright moon.\nDo not wait until sweeping my sleeves to depart,\nFor there will be only sorrow and choked sobs.\n\n**For Daoist Assemblies Everywhere**\nHaving joined the same current,\nDo not pursue the strange.\nThrough the four seasons’ heat and cold,\nThe three luminaries’ decline and prosperity.\nPreserve the pure teachings’ wind,\nNever grow lax.\nDaoist brothers,\nPurify your hearts and endure.\nExert yourselves for the public good,\nFor the great affair of karmic conditions.\nExternally, repay the gods and heaven,\nInternally, uphold the true precepts.\nThe whole being radiant and bright,\nSettle all karmic debts.\nEradicate past deeds,\nPerceive without obstruction.\nEnter the gate of myriad wonders,\nRefine the indestructible true.\nEach one devotes to the real,\nEvery person awakens and understands.\nAscend into the formless,\nPervading the dharma-realm.\nA single spark of spirit,\nAbides through ancient and modern times.\n\n**Two Poems for Elder Master Wang**\nDragon and tiger, water and fire,\nLead and mercury, infant and maiden.\nEndless transformations,\nA single qi, free and at ease.\nDragons move, rain descends,\nIncense follows the seat.\nEmbodying virtue and power,\nAll transformations lend support.\n\n**Two Poems on Attaining the Dao**\nThe great Dao’s original source,\nHeaven and earth’s decline and prosperity.\nEmerging from my own body,\nThe primordial chaos of the three realms.\nThe numinous treasure

leaking source,\nTrue emptiness and water-fire congeal in union.\nCirculating true qi, the numinous cinnabar forms,\nDao-bones and immortal winds—azure and piercing chill.\nSeven-jeweled golden lotuses gleam in the great void,\nThe Three Palaces brightly illumine the autumn moon.\nSuddenly all dharmas open, beyond words or explanation,\nThe household of kalpas cannot be transcended.\nFrom ancient times to now, this single truth endures,\nAll heavens gather in assembly to pay homage together.\n\n---\n\n**Chant of Nurturing the Vast**\n\nVacuous and boundless, one qi newly vast,\nThe Four Temporaries embrace priceless treasures.\nLet not the immortal life be snared by dust,\nNor speak of bitter emptiness and hardship’s sting.\nNurture truth, cultivate nature, preserve essence’s bloom,\nGather mercury, refine lead, guard the Valley Spirit.\nOne qi ascends, transcending creation’s bounds,\nThe Two Modes transform and temper, meeting the Primal True.\nThe Zhou-Tian’s wax and wane yields the elixir of years,\nThe full Dao flourishes the wondrous colored body.\nRevolving the inner elixir by fire’s timing,\nBearing sun and moon, the toad-wheel swiftly turns.\nThe Three Fields transform into the numinous palace’s snow,\nThe Five Viscera harmonize, sweet dew’s nectar flows.\nThe inner treasure complete—the fruit of no leakage,\nPure Yang merges, the cause of past and present.\nClear tones, distinct, stir mountain spirits,\nCloud feasts clamor, resounding by the sea’s edge.\nMeeting all heavens to propagate the great teaching,\nTimely encountering the Sage Emperor enthroned in majesty.\nOnly pray for loyal aid through a thousand autumns,\nGazing upward to bless the imperial foundation for ten thousand springs.\nGreat virtue, great merit—accomplishing the great Dao,\nThe Great Net once more gathers old friends and kin.\n\n---\n\n**Chant of Wondrous Transformation**\n\nThe Master of Universal Transformation, pure of heart,\nPure heart and Dao unite as one.\nSweep away each and every thought,\nLet no thing be pushed to its limit.\nStabilize nature, preserving past and present,\nNurture spirit, continuing the ancestral line.\nMeeting the master, the secret is personally revealed,\nSilently following the cloud’s trace.\nWondrous things soar into the void,\nThe Mystic Pearl falls into the Crimson Palace.\nEndlessly harmonizing the Jade Tiger,\nGently moving the Vermilion Dragon.\nThe Red Phoenix spreads golden wings,\nThe Azure Luan dances in the great sky.\nThe spirit furnace refines the jade countenance,\nThe golden tripod casts the vermilion visage.\nWithin and without, radiant light congeals,\nOn the cinnabar terrace, snow melts to warm crimson.\nHaving realized truth, transcending creation,\nBright moon and clear wind.\n\n---\n\n**Chant of Opening Transformation**\n\nNon-action, purity—inner cultivation complete,\nFirst encountering Heaven’s Origin, the Dao is not hard.\nNaturally attaining the formless, merging as one,\nThe numinous beings of the Dark Capital lock the hidden pass.\nFlaming great qi rises and falls in emptiness,\nResplendent celestial light rolls upon the jade altar.\nSilent, the ten

      "translated_text": "**[Lyrics] \"Spring in Qin Garden\"**\n\nFrom seven years of age, I encountered the Lord of Eastern Florescence in the void, who awakened me from dullness. In the *wuchen* year of the Dading era, I again met Master Chongyang, and so composed this lyric to record the truth:\n\nInnately endowed with the immortal embryo,\nAt seven, my hidden radiance merged with the great yang.\nMoved by the true traces of Eastern Florescence,\nDrifting through the void to bestow his regard,\nI awoke to the dream of the human world—\nThen once more met Chongyang.\nSecretly I knocked at the Mysterious Pass,\nAs he subtly expounded profound discourse,\nRefining the single yang with bright moon and clear wind.\nThe divine elixir congealed,\nContinuing the pivot of the celestial sphere,\nAscending in transformation to the pure yang.\n\nJoyfully I danced and bowed to Pure Yang,\nWith the wondrously empty Heavenly Master and True Yang.\nCommanded by Sea Toad to guide and advance Star Yang,\nWith Yuanmiao, the ancient Ren An,\nAnd Yin Xi, the Pass Keeper of Danyang.\nThe Great Dao spread horizontally,\nDriving clouds across the world,\nUtterly sweeping away karmic demons to reveal Jade Sun.\nAll immortals gathered,\nExpounding the heavenly principle of non-birth,\nThe true yang beyond the void.\n\n---\n\n**Twenty-One \"Court-Filling Fragrance\" Lyrics**\n*Composed at Cloud Radiance Grotto on Iron Fork Mountain*\n\nBending to gaze at the azure sea,\nScreening mountains layer upon layer,\nMyriad pines and cypresses stand solemn.\nGolden waves surge,\nClouds shroud the emerald peaks.\nBy day, I face the vast and limpid light;\nAt night’s end, the moon’s fresh imprint appears.\nIn perfect clarity it gathers,\nCrimson radiance enfolding,\nThe immortal emerging from the grotto.\n\nThe original true countenance,\nNow utterly realized,\nI recline high in the cloud pavilion.\nFor the elixir furnace is without leakage,\nNurturing the three thousand.\nThe sagely ancestor bestows descending radiance,\nAll heavens lift the infant to attend the Origin.\nWhen merit is complete,\nGolden script and purple edicts\nWill ever stand before the Jade Emperor.\n\n---\n\n*For Elder Brother Da Lang*\n\nA single spark of numinous light,\nManifesting from the void,\nTreading the heights of peace amidst mist and rosy clouds.\nClear wind and bright moon\nFlow into the cinnabar of Jade Capital.\nThe five qi and three primals knit their excellence,\nAscending where cloud chariots intertwine.\nAt the Penglai assembly,\nAuspicious light drifts ethereally,\nFilling the seats with scattered incense and flowers.\n\nHow splendid!\nThe true wondrous work:\nA single grain of immortal elixir,\nBrilliantly illuminating Eastern Florescence.\nFilling the vast emptiness,\nThe pure realm knows no bounds.\nRecognizing the original, primal nature,\nThrough cultivation,\nThe pure and tranquil root-sprout.\nWhen perfection is achieved,\nWithin the moon’s shadow,\nSteadily ascend to the Great Luo’s abode.\n\n---\n\n*For Liu Chaozhen of the Capital*\n\nThe four greats’ demeanor,\nThe three fields’ numinous excellence,\nRefined into ninefold-transmuted cinnabar.\nEmpty and free,\nI make the Dao my livelihood.\nThe Pure Land’s auspicious light and propitious hues,\nExquisite and penetrating,\nMist and rosy clouds beyond the heavens.\nIn harmony,\nSun flies and moon runs,\nTogether moving the purple river chariot.\n\nTrue immortals open wondrous realms,\nBodhi and Buddha-fruit,\nA single principle without distinction.\nPointing to the Jade Clarity’s realm,\nHow distant is this moment?\nAwaiting the golden script and purple edicts,\nWorldly affairs\nOriginally held no entanglements.\nWhen the time comes to return,\nCelebrating the celestial assembly on high,\nTo whom shall I boast of the scenery?\n\n---\n\n**Two Lyrics for Lu Xuanwu**\n\nWithin the sun, the golden rooster;\nWithin the moon, the jade hare,\nTransforming and circulating the celestial signs’ wax and wane.\nFormless, it revolves,\nThe three realms manifesting compassion.\nNurturing all heavens and earth,\nSupporting the three teachings,\nThe world returns to reliance.\nTruly enlightened,\nObserving heaven’s Dao,\nPure and non-active.\n\nAll Daoists of the ten directions,\nTurning their heads in sudden awakening,\nSweep their sleeves and return to the clouds.\nNurturing the immortal embryo’s numinous bones,\nForging and extinguishing the yin corpse.\nCertainly, the countenance is renewed and the form transformed,\nPenetrating the profound mysteries,\nMaintaining essence beyond the material.\nWhen the elixir is complete,\nThe root-source utterly realized,\nAll become masters who ferry others.\n\n---\n\nAgain:\n\nThe heart burns true incense,\nThe spirit arrays wondrous offerings,\nFilling the void to transmit the elixir formula.\nGathering and treasuring the numinous treasures,\nAuspicious omens naturally appear.\nA single point pierces through kalpas,\nWithin the two modes,\nYin and yang reverse and return.\nThe joy of the perfected truth,\nThe full moon of nature,\nIts light scattering fragrant radiance throughout the void.\n\nSearching and examining the profound mysteries,\nThe root-source without leakage,\nMoral power fragrant.\nGathering the spirit-sand and jade liquid,\nNo risk of collapse or loss.\nThe fruition of the true immortal’s wondrous Dao,\nTranscending the three realms,\nUtterly cool and boundless.\nThe whole family awakens,\nNurturing the spirit and fostering vastness,\nAll attain the Penglai estate.\n\n---\n\n*For Prefect Liu Xianwu of Laiyang County*\n\nTransmitted through the ages,\nChangyang’s sacred land,\nWell-suited for cultivating the six perfections and three altars.\nStill the heart and sever thoughts,\nNurturing the purple-gold elixir.\nThe Jade Grotto gathers and returns the myriad transformations,\nUpon Kunlun’s ridge,\nWind and moon glisten.\nCloud radiance gathers,\nThe three fields knit their excellence,\nReversing age to change the youthful countenance.\n\nThe Mysterious Pass firmly sealed,\nGolden infant and jade maiden,\nImmortal edicts pursue and ascend.\nHanging the six heavens’ *ruyi*,\nAgain gathering orchids.\nVast and distant, soaring high in the long sky,\nDrifting and gathering,\nImmortals arrayed in ranks.\nDo you know?\nWith deep karmic affinity and broad practice,\nAttaining the Dao is fundamentally not difficult.\n\n---\n\n**[Cinnabar Hill]**\n\nAt Cinnabar Furnace Hill north of Wangyuan Village in Fushan County, Daoist friends gathered to converse. Discussing how this hill was once Master Fangping’s place of cultivation, suddenly from the void came a response, and so I composed this:\n\nCinnabar Furnace forms the ridge,\nClear waters coil and wind,\nOnce the estate of Wang Yuan’s family.\nEight mountains rise in emerald,\nFour waters gather the worthy.\nFive-colored auspicious clouds cover,\nFrom the three heavens,\nImmortal melodies ring clear.\nThe golden youth reports,\nFrom the nine skies transmitting,\nMy radiance embraces all without exception.\n\nFrom the void’s beginning, the question arises:\nTrue suchness responds with goodness,\nThe great Dharma’s empty king.\nExpounding suffering, emptiness, and prajñā,\nLeft and right, round and square.\nEstablishing teachings, dividing vehicles to guide and ferry,\nPenetrating the ten stages,\nAll sages’ practices and retreats.\nWithin the void,\nThe great Dao of non-being and non-non-being,\nThrough kalpas, eternally boundless.\n\n---\n\n*For Those Who Have Left the Household*\n\nThe essence of rice and wheat,\nHarmonious and tranquil,\nNaturally completing the spirit through transformation.\nThe wondrous Dao of non-birth,\nGradually transforming good causes.\nHaving attained longevity and enduring vision,\nIlluminating inversions,\nMoon as companion, wind as neighbor.\nThe former master’s teachings:\nNurturing the true and realizing nature,\nEnriching the nation and pacifying the people.\n\nPure and fresh,\nSoaring and radiant,\nHeavenly might sweeps away,\nBeheading and extinguishing demonic vapors.\nSpreading great compassion’s sweet dew,\nWidely covering humanity.\nReturning to the former chaos before birth,\nAgain encountering\nWithered and decayed meeting spring.",

upright.\nAiding in the unfolding of the Mystery Gate,\nthey transformed and flourished the realm of Changyang.\n\nJade Yang Wang took the lead,\nguiding the sleeves of others.\nExternal temptations swayed the many lords,\nyet they bore fruit in the Quanzhen practice.\nCraftsmen and fellow practitioners must show utmost reverence.\nMoved by the winds of Fufeng,\nthey aspired solely toward Penglai.\n\nThe Dharma names of Jiang and Zhong:\nZhong Shouzhong, Jiang Shoujing.\nThey guided Danyang’s transmission,\ndelivering and liberating all spiritual natures.\nWith earnest devotion and steadfast hearts, all held them in respect.\nFar and near, their virtue spread,\nand all revered them as true sages.\n\nYet now, who still listens?\nThe craftsmen face hardship,\nrecklessly wielding their sharp edges.\nHow much fine timber is cast aside!\nFirst, they demand payment,\ndaring not defy their commands.\n\n**Xu Gong’s Inquiry on the Fruits of Adversity**\n\nGuard the sprouting bud, nurture the auspicious fruit.\nThe seven-jeweled golden lotus\nshall bear the fruit of long life.\nThrough non-action and non-striving, the Dao’s fruit is attained.\nEmerging from the mundane cage,\none decisively verifies the fruit of true immortality.\n\nTo cultivate in old age is difficult,\nfor true essence leaks away,\nruining the fruit of the Jetavana.\nClapping hands in vain, one returns without cause or effect.\nLike the relentless march of impermanence,\nhasten to refine the fruit of Quanzhen.\n\n**Sending Master Danyang’s Dharma Body to the Western Pass**\n\nAlas, the wayward husband strays from the true Dao,\ndeftly wielding schemes,\nslandering with cunning and deceit.\nThe sect’s traditions are ruined, with nowhere to appeal.\nLike a shattered mirror or a kite’s broken wings,\nhow can I make this clear?\n\nNow, who dares to vouch?\nPoison concealed within,\nthey bring disgrace upon the Quanzhen teachings.\nFrom the Eastern Sea to Western Qin, all are afflicted.\nCao, Jia, and Lai—\nheavenly retribution must come.\n\n**Admonition to Li, Liang, and Zhang**\n\nLi, Zhang, and Liang, heed my brief words.\nDo not hesitate or waver,\nlest your hearts be overturned.\nEver resentful that Jade Yang offers no reply,\nwith such cultivation,\nwhen shall you return to Penglai Isle?\n\nThe monk of Great Tang, old Jiudu,\nendured ten thousand hardships,\nyet with single-minded resolve, he pressed on.\nEastward he journeyed to propagate the Buddha’s teachings,\nharmonizing with the Tathāgata,\nverifying the fruit of the true and constant Dao.\n\n**Exhortation Against Nets and Traps**\n\nSince birth, I have never feared death.\nWith roots deeply anchored,\none verifies the position of long life.\nAll sentient beings share no slight difference.\nMay all be universally safe—\nthis is the will of Heaven.\n\nWielding compassion,\npresenting refined auspices,\nradiant clouds and rosy mists arise,\nmyriad rays of auspicious light.\nThe lofty immortals of the three realms rejoice in the Dharma,\nsafeguarding all people,\neach free from calamity and harm.\n\n**Exhortation to the Deluded**\n\nAlas, the deluded, like the deeply drunk,\ndare to scheme and contend,\ndisputing heaven and earth.\nKilling, stealing, lust, and deceit violate divine principles.\nEver ignorant,\nheedless of the impending judgment.\n\nWhen qi returns to emptiness and form decays,\nconsciousness flickers faintly,\nwandering into the dark prison.\nWho will release the boundless wronged souls?\nWhips lash their bodies,\nserpents and dogs vie to devour them.\n\n**Exhortation to Boatmen**\n\nI urge you all to take an oath:\nlay aside your nets and traps,\nseek livelihoods in kindness.\nThe gods and spirits watch over you.\nMay your blessings and longevity multiply,\nand may you savor sweetness anew.\n\nAttain true joy, cast off filth.\nWith a nature perfectly luminous,\nall dharmas are relinquished.\nQuietly observe the wellspring of spirit arise in elegance.\nReturn to youth, reclaiming\nthe realm of pure coolness.\n\n**Three Exhortations on Cultivation**\n\nDiscern the Three Fields, unblock the Eight Vessels.\nNine revolutions of radiance,\na single speck of dust cannot intervene.\nUnfettered true compassion flows into the obscure and silent.\nThe cinnabar treasure and spiritual sprout\nbear the hues of blue, yellow, and white.\n\nPierce the Kun Palace, the abode of the immortal cassia.\nThe divine pearl emerges and retreats,\nbeyond the void, blazing crimson.\nI exhort the transient guests of the dusty world:\ngather your hearts early,\nand complete the true merit.\n\n**Again**\n\nTo cultivate, you must thoroughly investigate.\nGrasp the wellspring of spirit,\nlest the cinnabar elixir leak away.\nThis practice is rare in the world.\nWithin, attain the wholeness of spirit;\nwithout, attain longevity of body.\n\nDiscern the harmonious merging, illuminate the union.\nJade liquid and nectar,\nswallowing the brilliance of the Three Lights.\nCirculating above and below, completing the nine nines,\nbursting through the Gate of Heaven,\nforever befriending the mist and rosy clouds.\n\n**Again**\n\nIn the white lotus pond, the golden liquid marsh,\ndragons sport with luminous pearls,\npurple mists ever encircling.\nTigers charge the flock of sheep at the mountain’s base.\nStartled, the white ox leaps\nby the winding river’s edge.\n\nThe red simurgh soars, the vermilion phoenix cries.\nThe infant at the sea’s bottom\nholds fast, laughing with the tortoise and serpent.\nThe yellow sprout grows through each joint.\nWithin yin, yang is born—\nhow many truly know this?\n\n**To Li Yiweng of Penglai**\n\nSpeaking of cultivation, you have been granted favor.\nTruly turn your heart,\nwhy cling to wife and children?\nA true man does not let others count his debts.\nThrough the bitter sea he roams,\nseeking a path forward.\n\nEscape the dusty world, emerge from the dark abode.\nThe seven ancestors who have passed\nare delivered and ascend on cloud steps.\nHaving escaped the wheel of rebirth, you gradually awaken.\nWhen merit is complete and practice fulfilled,\nyou shall surely be summoned by the Three Purities.\n\n**On Encountering Opportunities for Transformation**\n\nMeeting the conditions for practice, encountering wise friends,\nthe Dharma water irrigates the heart,\neach drop penetrating with numinous clarity.\nGathered in the furnace, nothing strays outward.\nThe two qi ascend and merge,\ninverting and converging in auspicious radiance.\n\nPiercing the Mud Pill, flowing behind the elbows,\nday and night diligently,\nnot allowing the slightest leak.\nSeizing the Mystery Pearl, presenting it with skillful hands,\nstepping on clouds toward the azure sky,\nonly then is the great Dao accomplished.\n\n**Gazing Toward Penglai (To the Tune of \"Wang Jiangnan\") – Four Poems**\n\n**Sent to Master Chaoyuan**\n\nMaster
