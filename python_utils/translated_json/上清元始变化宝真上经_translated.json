  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Transformations and Treasured True Essence**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Transformations and Treasured True Essence*. Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Compiled as a single fascicle from the first volume of *The Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise*. Base text from *The Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*. Collated with *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Transformations and Treasured True Essence, the Nine Numinous and Most Wondrous Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise* #1.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Transformations and Treasured True Essence**\n\nThe sacred scriptures of Supreme Clarity arose at the inception of the Nine Heavens, born of spontaneity and coexisting with qi. The Three Radiant Ones shone in unison, manifesting above the Nine Heavens and within the Great Void. At times, they coalesced into soaring dark-purple qi, forming numinous texts—celestial writings of ineffable subtlety, their strokes sinuous and intricate. Each character spanned a *zhang* in size, their details elusive; none but the Perfected Kings of the Nine Heavens could fathom their profound resonance.\n\nIn the first year of the *Shangxu* era, the Perfected Kings of the Nine Heavens commanded the Supreme Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Capital to cast golden tablets. The assembled sages clarified their meanings, and the Highest Oral Instructions were compiled into numinous chapters. The Jade Emperor inscribed them with his brush, engraving the tablets into scripture. Their structure—with its elevations and descents, ranks and prohibitions—all derived from the esoteric decrees of the Most High Sages. Sealed within the Jade Chamber of the Celestial Palace above the Nine Heavens, they were guarded by the Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence and the Purple Lads of the Golden Dawn of the Primordial Numinous Palace.\n\nMount Tortoise of the West—also called Dragon Mountain—serves as the root and pivot of the Nine Heavens, the abyssal repository of the myriad qi. Located at the northwest corner of the heavens, it spans four hundred thousand *li* in circumference, its summit contiguous with the Jade Clarity. To the southeast, it adjoins the rosy clouds of the Yang-Pervading Realm, ascending to the Gate of the Divine Tiger of the Azure Palace. To the northwest, it intersects the Frigid Wastes, rising to the Court of the Immortals of the Golden Portals. To the south, it extends to the Crimson Floating Pear Realm, its qi harmonizing with the radiance of the Cavernous Yang. To the north, it points toward the Celestial Enclosure, linking with the Canopy of Flowers, its qi traversing the Vast Numinous. At its center, it aligns directly with the Eightfold Crossroads of the Jade Capital atop the summit of the Intersecting Winds Mountain. Thirty thousand *li* of level heavens are walled in smelted gold and gated in carved jade, adorned with golden terraces, jade towers, and twelve divine palaces.\n\nAbove stand the naturally flowing Essence-Purple Towers and Golden Florescence Halls, chambers of chalcedony and jasper, flanked by nine cavernous grottoes. Spontaneous purple clouds arise, interwoven with phoenix-script, their nine hues cascading in array. Cliffs bear purple cassia, ridges flourish with jasper groves, their branches formed of coral, their roots of jade. The trees of the *qian* groves bear fruit, their boughs laden with white jade rings. The Three Florescence blossoms gleam in the crimson radiance, while reverse fragrance flows through the Great Mystery. The Eight Qi fan the whirlwinds, and jade flutes resound in the void, composing celestial music. Dragons roar upon cloud towers, phoenixes cry from perilous peaks. Venomous beasts gather in the thousands, serpents coil a thousand *xun* in length. Divine palaces stand majestic, cloud-borne immortals swarm in profusion. The towering Primordial Halls brim with emanations, for this is the wondrous transformation of the Primordial Origin, the true numinous root of the Celestial Origin.\n\nWithin the Golden Florescence Hall, above the northern window, a spontaneous purple qi coalesces into mysterious script. Characters a *zhang* in size descend in radiant splendor, their celestial writing of ineffable subtlety, beyond mortal comprehension.\n\nIn the first year of the *Shangjia* era, the Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens fasted in the Cloud Palace and feasted in the radiance of Mount Tortoise. There, he inscribed golden tablets and transcribed the mysterious script, resolving its long-standing obscurities and expounding its numinous resonance. It was recorded as *The Crimson Sovereign’s Flying Dark-Purple Writ of Mount Tortoise*.\n\nOn the first *yin* day of the first month of the first year of the *Kaihuang* era, the Queen Mother of the West rode the void in numinous flight, soaring through the Nine Empyreans. She fasted upon Mount Tortoise and ascended the naturally flowing Essence-Purple Tower and Golden Florescence Jasper Hall. Gazing upon the northern window, she paid homage to the mysterious script, contemplating the cliffs in reverence and meditating upon the Supreme Perfected Ones. Thereupon, her wondrous perception awakened, and her cinnabar heart revealed its truth. Suddenly, a Great Divine Perfected One of Heaven appeared, girded with the sun and moon, a halo encircling his neck. Preceded by a retinue of feather-canopied immortals, he arrived upon a flying chariot of ninefold purple clouds, trailing auroral radiance. Kneeling before the Queen Mother, he announced: \"I am the Perfected King of the Phoenix Palace of the Nine Heavens, surnamed Supreme Mystery, styled Open Brightness. By command of the Primordial Heavenly King, I bear the Nine Heavens’ Golden Writ in purple characters on azure-golden cinnabar tablets, to bestow upon the Queen Mother.\" He conferred upon her the title *Supreme Perfected Mother of the Nine Numinous Ones of the Western Origin* and enfeoffed her as the Peak of Western Tortoise. He also bestowed a plain writ containing *The Primordial Record of the Supreme Perfected One’s Transformations at Birth*, entrusting her with the oversight of the immortal registers and the succession of the Jade Clarity.\n\nAdditionally, he presented her with azure-jade tablets, a *feng*-robe of flying azure feathers, a Morning Infant Jade Crown, phoenix-cloud sandals, a divine phoenix-purple wheel, a flying feathered canopy of twenty-four carriages, and five-colored banners of numinous command. He further assigned seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace’s Golden Florescence to attend the Perfected Mother, who was to govern the flowing Essence-Purple Tower and Golden Florescence Jasper Hall. Thrice each month, she would ascend to the Jade Clarity, twice feast upon Kunlun, and five times review the assembled immortals.\n\nWhen the Great Divine Perfected One had completed his mission, he returned to his jade palace. The Perfected Mother then ascended her throne and addressed the assembly in the Jasper Hall. She commanded her attendants, the Jade Lad Deng and Dong Shuangcheng, to receive with reverence the golden writ in purple characters on azure-jade tablets, the azure-golden cinnabar writ of imperial bestowal, *The Primordial Record of the Supreme Perfected One’s Transformations at Birth*, and the *Flying Dark-Purple Writ*—four items in total—wrapped in a cinnabar-sovereign seal and enshrined within the chalcedony chamber. She assigned thirty Jade Maidens of the Golden Florescence and thirty Purple Dawn Jade Lads to guard the numinous script. Following the ancient statutes of the Three Heavens’ structural protocols, she reported to the Five Emperors, the Five Peaks, the numinous mountains, rivers, and seas, commanding their deities to submit the names of aspirants five times monthly, distinguishing merits and transgressions by rank for memorialization.\n\nOn each of the eight solar terms, and five times each month, the Perfected Mother feasted in the Cloud Palace, traversing the Five Peaks, surveying the sources of rivers, and gazing upon the eight directions. At such times, the Five Planets aligned, the sun and moon paused in their radiance, the hundred yangs discharged lightning, molten gold gleamed with essence, Heavenly Soldiers led the vanguard, and the Five Elders bore banners. The Perfected Mother ever rode her nine-hued chariot of purple-cloud flying wheels, attended by five thousand Jade Maidens of the Celestial Immortals.\n\nThen the women rode phoenixes, the men mounted dragons, and the flying immortals in feathered robes each held floral banners. Reed pipes, flutes, drums, and winds blended in harmonious tones, while luan birds sang and phoenixes cried, their voices ringing through the cloud formations. Radiant lights intertwined, the Three Luminaries merged in brilliance. Purple youths wafted incense to dispel impurities, while divine consorts scattered blossoms to bathe the perfected. Heavenly chimes resounded beneath their banners, purple mists veiled the empty courtyard, jade effulgences streamed across the firmament, and numinous transformations subdued the myriad spirits.\n\nAt such times, the Six Heavens obeyed her command, all malevolent forces shrank in form, demons and monsters lost their sight, the heavens cleared, and the air grew pure—truly the wondrous spectacle of lofty immortals, the luminous numen of the Cinnabar Sovereign manifest in its full glory.\n\n**The Cinnabar Sovereign of Tortoise Mountain’s Flying Mystery Purple Writ**\n*Flying Mystery Purple Qi congeals the numinous root,*\n*The net of Jade Clarity governs the myriad spirits.*\n*In the void, it surges and coalesces of itself;*\n*Above, twelve towering peaks stand in succession.*\n\n*Jade towers soar resplendent in luminous clouds,*\n*Flowing essence graces the purple palace with golden eaves.*\n*The jasper hall gleams with the brilliance of the Eight Transcendents;*\n*Within, the Nine Numinous Immortals of Azure Gold emerge.*\n\n*The Cinnabar Sovereign True Mother is named Essence-Prolonging,*\n*Clad in flying azure feathered robes, crowned with the Morning Infant’s diadem.*\n*In her left hand she holds the jade scepter, in her right the numinous banner;*\n*Five-colored spirits command the demons, attending the August Honored One.*\n\n*Grasping talismans and registers at the Gate of Life,*\n*She chews the moon and sucks the sun, inhaling jade springs.*\n*The Net of Separation exhales radiance to refine the five souls;*\n*Within, it fills and overflows, delighting the Crimson Palace.*\n\n*Golden light shines resplendent, her form perfectly round.*\n*From the new moon she enters the Metal phase, its color turbid and dim—*\n*Only the Enlightened One at dawn speaks of this.*\n*On the fifth day of the fifth month, the Northern Primordial’s essence,*\n*The inscribed canopy appears, leading the immortals.*\n\n*Purple Qi revolves leftward with the Dipper’s motion,*\n*Passing through the four sevens to enter the Golden Gate.*\n*Just then, the Cinnabar Sovereign reviews the myriad immortals;*\n*Those who understand this secret must redouble their diligence.*\n\n*Clothe your form and concentrate your thoughts, ever keeping them distinct;*\n*When wondrous visions respond, grasp the essential writ.*\n*After three years, you shall surely preserve your wholeness;*\n*After nine years, you shall ascend through the void to don the feathered skirt.*\n\n*Lightly soaring in phoenix robes, you shall ascend Dragon Mountain,*\n*Gazing up and down to the Nine Numinous Ones, you shall pay homage to the Jade Dawn.*\n*The Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen declared:*\n*This is the writ of congealed Purple Qi and Flying Mystery, inscribed upon the western Tortoise Mountain, flowing essence upon the northern window of the Purple Palace’s Golden Flower Jasper Hall. The Nine Heavens’ Celestial Venerable beheld its chapters and recorded it as the* Tortoise Mountain Cinnabar Sovereign’s Flying Mystery Purple Writ.\n\n*The Queen Mother of the West ever treasured and concealed it; its purport is profound and recondite, all being the subtle rhymes of the Nine Heavens. Without immortal rank, one may not so much as glance at its title. Those who obtain it are all recorded in the Nine Heavens’ registers, their names inscribed upon Tortoise Mountain.*\n\n*The Nine Heavens’ Celestial Venerable instructed:*\n*Practice this Way during the ten months of the year—namely, the first through ninth months, and the eleventh and twelfth months. On the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month—five times monthly—purify yourself and recite the Mystery Writ once. After midnight, go forth into the central courtyard, gaze upward, and await the Purple Cloud Qi within the Canopy of the Northern Dipper. Observe it revolving leftward from the Dipper’s handle, passing through the twenty-eight lunar lodges in sequence, and returning above the Golden Gate. If the sky is overcast and no light appears, perform this inwardly within your chamber, visualizing the method as above with utmost clarity. Upon completing the visualization, bow four times toward the Purple Cloud, click your teeth thrice, and raise your gaze to pray:*\n\n*This night is clear and bright, the hidden void reveals the true;*\n*Flowing clouds drift and linger, golden flowers unfold on four sides.*\n*The Cinnabar Sovereign spreads its radiance, the numinous flies in the purple chariot.*\n*This evening, it unfolds and arrays itself; Azure Gold confers immortality.*\n*Fulfill my supreme aspiration, may my body accord with spontaneity.*\n*Bind my life to the moon’s essence, preserve the root of my years and days.*\n*May the Three Numinous Ones merge in splendor, eternally abiding on Dragon Mountain.*\n*In the secret night, I don pure vestments—grant my request as spoken.*\n\n*Then draw the Purple Qi into your mouth and swallow it twenty-eight times. After three years of this practice, divine perfected beings shall descend as omens upon your sleeping mat. Your body shall be enveloped in Purple Qi, your form interwoven with its glow. Your name shall be inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ registers, and you shall surely ascend as an immortal.*\n\n*The Nine Heavens’ Celestial Venerable said:*\n*The heavens’ writs are myriad, each expounding its wonders. Even this single matter suffices to summon numinous perfected beings to descend, to shake their wings in the Nine Empyreans, to soar through the Jade Clarity, and to wander and feast in the Cloud Palace. Were it not a wondrous method, the Queen Mother of the West would not have concealed it within her inner robe, nor would the Great Existence have left its prohibitions unspoken.*\n\n*The Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen said:*\n*The heavens possess clouds of forbidden Qi that encroach upon the divisions of the sun, moon, and five planets. In those regions and kingdoms, there are always those who accord with the Dao and lords who attain immortality. When such signs appear, their images become visible.*\n\n*The Nine Heavens’ Celestial Venerable said:*\n*Upon seeing such clouds, perform the rites and prayers according to the writ—there is no need to wait for an appointed day. Apply yourself diligently, and when the clouds descend, you shall ascend to meet them. Seal this within your heart; do not lightly show it to others. If the Dao is divulged, its numen scatters, and immortals shall have no means to respond.*\n\n**The Highest Primordial Bestows the Azure Gold Cinnabar Sovereign Jade Writ upon the Queen Mother of the West**\n*The Most High Primordial addressed the Numinous Nine Heavens and the Ancestral Void:*\n*The Queen Mother of the West, whose name is Graceful Robe, is the Qi of the Nine Numinous Ones of the Heavens, the coalesced essence of the Western Metal, the embodied bones of Purple Cloud, the refined radiance of the sun’s essence. She inhales and exhales the splendor of the seven luminaries, harmonizes with the morning auroras to feast on the marrow of the sun’s phoenix, and sips the moon’s essence and orchid brain. It congeals within the jade root and golden storehouse, binding and weaving her cinnabar form, her purple heart entwined in eightfold coils. Manifest in the Cinnabar Sovereign’s wondrous chart, she is exalted among the imperial chariots, reposing in the numinous peaks, her heart ashen in the Upper Clarity. Her merits aid the ten thousand kinds, her kindness overflows all living beings. Holding fast to her singular integrity, she endures through kalpas unending. Thus did the Highest Primordial of the Curved Flower bestow upon her this writ.*\n\n*For Graceful Robe’s virtue of Golden Perfection, he conferred upon her the title of Azure Gold Cinnabar Sovereign, the Transcendent Mother of the Nine Numinous Ones of the Western Primordial. He invested her with rulership over Tortoise Mountain, entrusting her with the governance of the primordial registers. In accordance with the rhythms of inhalation and exhalation, he granted her the Azure Jade Tablet inscribed in gold and jade script, the Nine Heavens’ phoenix robes of flying azure feathers, the Morning Infant’s jade crown and phoenix-cloud sandals, twenty-four chariots of divine phoenixes with purple wheels and flying feathered canopies, five-colored staffs and banners as tokens of command over the numinous, flowing-gold fire bells and night-shining candles, jade writs to extinguish demons and Nine Heavens’ imperial decrees as pledges. To guard her, he assigned seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace and Western Flower, who attend her in the Flowing Essence Purple Palace and Golden Flower Palace on Western Tortoise Mountain. Thrice monthly she ascends to the Jade Clarity, twice she feasts on Kunlun. She reviews the multitudes of immortals, and the Five Peaks, rivers, seas, and the deities of the ten directions—none are beyond her governance, as fully set forth in this writ.*\n\nAll ritual protocols shall follow the ancient statutes of the Jade Terrace’s *Great Possession* and the orthodox texts of the Three Heavens. The issuance of azure-jade tablets inscribed with golden script and jade characters, the Azure-Golden Cinnabar August Writs—all derive from the celestial norms of the *Great Possession* Palace’s *Yin-Yang* protocols, all composed in the spontaneously generated chapters of the *High Mystery Cavern Void*, to be conferred upon the offices of the loftiest perfected and sagely beings, not bestowed upon novices. Even the Golden Tower’s Eastern Florescence and Square Cauldrons Palaces possess their own ritual protocols for summoning novice ascended immortals. These, too, originate from the *Great Possession*’s norms, differing only in rank and hierarchy.\n\nUnless one’s name is recorded in the Nine Heavens or inscribed in the Square Cauldrons’ registers, one shall never glimpse their contents. Those who obtain sight of their texts are destined for rebirth with inscribed tablets, their names listed in the Emperor’s celestial ledgers, fated to attain divine transcendence—thus preordained in the numinous statutes. On the day of Daoic attainment, celestial perfected beings shall naturally descend to receive their writs and conferred texts.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: The golden script and jade characters are all engraved upon azure-jade tablets, or inscribed upon green-jade tablets. Each tablet measures nine inches and nine fen in length, two inches and four fen in width, with characters threaded in gold. Two jade lads and two jade maidens attend each tablet, managing incense and verifying seals. According to the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, if a qualified recipient exists within a century, a single transmission is permitted.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: Azure-jade is not something worldly beings may employ. If one’s name is recorded in the Square Cauldrons and one gains sight of its texts, one may also engrave them upon green-wood tablets, threading the characters in gold, storing them in a sapphire brocade pouch. After burning incense and performing obeisance for nine years, celestial perfected beings shall naturally descend to bestow the azure-jade tablets.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: The primordial registers of incipient transformation and the *Nine Qi*’s *Primordial Cavern* arose together. The Supreme Jade Emperor, the august sagely and imperial perfected, all compose their names and titles from the *Primordial Cavern*’s qi, while their robes, crowns, and adornments derive from the *Great Possession*’s *Yin-Yang* ritual protocols. Even their native villages and district names arise spontaneously. Heaven possesses the qi of the Eight Assemblies and the revolutions of the Four Epochs, which govern the Jade Void, divide and regulate yin and yang, initiate the mysterious transformations, and engender the myriad forms. The transformations and luminous manifestations of the loftiest sages shift with the four seasons, aligning with cosmic revolutions and celestial decrees, advancing with the flux of change—without aging or decline, enduring eternally in transformation. Thus it is said: *The Dao has no constant name*—this is what it means.\n\nThe Queen Mother’s virtue repays the High Mystery, making her the mother of the myriad qi. Therefore, the Primordial Commencement conferred the title of Cinnabar August upon her, bestowing a scroll of the *Primordial Writ of Plain Text* to transmit to later sagely and transcendent disciples, so they may know that the Primordial Commencement’s Dao composes spontaneously generated titles and possesses the qi of transformation. Those who glimpse its chapters shall have their names pre-inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ immortal ledgers and engraved upon the Cinnabar Terrace of the Square Cauldrons. By refining their concentrated thought without exceeding nine years, they shall attain the privilege of beholding the perfected in their chambers, transforming with the four seasons and soaring through the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: The High Mystery’s precious scriptures of the *Upper Clarity*’s Dao employ visualization as resonance and qi-swallowing as convergence. Once one gains access to their contents, one should immediately clarify the visualized images of the Primordial Commencement’s transformations, discerning their forms, colors, luminous qi, and adornments as they shift with the four seasons. Then, upon closing the eyes and refraining from speech, they shall naturally arrive; upon swallowing qi without deliberate induction, they shall naturally converge. If one does not behold the divine within a decade, or if one’s qi does not flourish within a month—later learners and worthies may yet diligently refine their thought, for the namable exists within the *Mysterious Void*, and the means to transcendence shall arise.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: Those who cultivate the Dao of upper transcendence—visualizing deities, invoking the perfected, ingesting qi, and swallowing saliva—yet remain ignorant of the Primordial Commencement’s titles, the root origins of the four seasons’ transformations, shifting luminous manifestations, and qi, merely close their eyes in vast obscurity, swallow emptily without intent—how shall the perfected deities descend? How shall qi and saliva flourish? Facing one another with gazes, there is already dimness; how much more so in the boundless expanse, where forms and qi remain undifferentiated? Such efforts are but futile exertions in repose, profitless in empty recitation.\n\n**The Primordial Register of the Upper Clarity’s Incipient Transformations**\n\nThe Primordial August Supreme Elder, the qi of the Primordial Jade Void, tabooed name *Yanshiyin*, styled *Guanwu Jue*, stands nine thousand myriad zhang in height. During the three months of spring, he wears the *Nine Qi*’s *Flowing Essence Purple Radiance* crown, robes of nine-light brocade, and a sash of naturally seamless nine-colored silk, girded with *Six Mountains Fire Jade*. He perpetually rides clouds of azure and verdant hues, and when seated, nine-colored lions radiate dazzling brilliance. In the *Upper Clarity*’s *Jade Void*, when visualized, he returns to a height of nine inches and nine fen.\n\nDuring the three months of summer, the Primordial August Supreme Elder transforms into a single body with nine heads, standing seven thousand zhang tall, crowned with nine-colored clouds, clad in a robe of cinnabar brocade woven with hundredfold luminous transformations, girded with the *Nine Great Immortals’ Refined Sword*, riding clouds of cinnabar and purple hues, seated upon nine-colored dragons, their radiance flowing and resplendent. In the *Jade Void*’s purple clouds, when visualized, he returns to a height of nine inches.\n\nDuring the three months of autumn, the Supreme Elder transforms into a single body with nine phoenix heads, standing five thousand zhang tall, clad in tiger robes of nine-colored stripes, riding seven-colored clouds, their radiant splendor intermingling. In the *Upper Clarity* above, when visualized, he returns to a height of seven inches and seven fen.\n\nDuring the three months of winter, the Supreme Elder transforms into a luminous manifestation of azure and black hues, vibrant as the moon’s essence—this is the reversion of the *Jade Void*’s qi, where he refines and receives the Primordial Commencement’s essence. When visualized, he reverts to his original primordial true form.\n\nTo cultivate the Dao of the Primordial Commencement, on the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), bathe and enter the chamber, face east, and pay homage to the Primordial August Supreme Elder with nine bows. Then turn north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the Supreme Elder’s four-seasonal forms in the *Upper Clarity*’s *Golden Luminance Palace*, *Jade Heaven Mansion*, *Eightfold Radiance District*, *Fixed Perfection Hamlet*, where he revolves the true and descends to illuminate one’s *Ming Tang* (Hall of Light). Silently recite the invocation:\n\nThe August Supreme unfolds the true, the nine Dao converge in radiance, transforming and refining the void, penetrating and illuminating the *Upper Clarity*. His form divides and radiates in effulgent manifestations, the four seasons flow in harmony, and I partake of his truth, merging with the numinous. Within, the *Jade Immortal* coalesces; without, the *Eightfold Obscurity* entwines. The *Eight Effulgences* lend their wings, conveying the *Cinnabar Chariot*. Riding clouds and mounting mist, he urges his steed through the *Upper Clarity*, soaring through the *Cloud Chambers* to pay homage at the *Imperial Capital*. Upon completion, he tilts his head to swallow the nine qi and ceases.\n\nOne who knows the inner secret names of the *Primordial Commencement*’s transformations and luminous manifestations shall attain a lifespan of nine hundred years. After nine years of cultivation, one may commune with the divine in countenance and transform one’s effulgence to soar through the great void.\n\nThe *Lofty Numinous Nine-Heaven King*, the qi of the *Primordial Void*, bears the secret name *Upper Vision of the Cavern* and the style *Moving Brahma*, his form spanning ninety million *zhang*. In the three months of autumn, he dons a *Golden Flower Crown*, robes of cloud-patterned brocade, and a *Ninefold Radiant Tinkling Girdle* of interwoven purple cords. He rides clouds of cinnabar and azure hues, seated upon nine-colored lions, his luminosity resplendent in the *Upper Clarity*, visualized as seven inches in length. In the three months of winter, the *Lofty Numinous Nine-Heaven King* transforms into a nine-headed form, each head crowned with a sun, his body clad in a nine-colored, feather-patterned phoenix robe. He ever rides clouds of azure and yellow, seated upon nine-colored lions, his radiant brilliance blazing in the *Upper Clarity*, visualized as reverting to his true form. In the three months of spring, the *Nine-Heaven King* divides his form into nine figures, each mouth holding a moon, clad in phoenix-patterned feathered robes. He ever rides nine-colored clouds, seated upon nine-colored mists, his luminosity resplendent in the *Upper Clarity*’s *Great Void*, visualized as reverting to his true form. In the three months of summer, the *Nine-Heaven King* transforms into a singular form of azure, purple, cinnabar, and crimson light, his qi chaotic and illuminating the nine heavens—this is the reversion of the *Great Void*’s qi, where he refines and receives the essence of the nine heavens, visualized as reverting to his true form.\n\nTo cultivate the Dao of the *Nine-Heaven True King*, on the day of the winter solar term, bathe and enter the chamber, face west, and pay homage to the *Nine-Heaven King* with nine bows. Then turn north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the *Nine-Heaven King*’s four-seasonal forms in the *Upper Clarity*’s *Golden Orchid Palace*, *Grand Clarity Mansion*, *Luminous Manifestation Hamlet*, *Penetrating Truth Village*, where he revolves the true and descends to illuminate one’s *Upper Cinnabar Field*. Silently recite the invocation:\n*Ninefold Numinous Primordial Essence, transform and refine the Upper Radiance,\nTriune convergence in effulgent harmony, qi dispersing form,\nEmerging from emptiness, entering the mysterious,\nAbove yellow, below azure,\nThrough cyclic revolutions of dawn,\nInterlacing the vermilion chariot,\nWandering the lofty void,\nRevolving to illuminate my court,\nMerging with the true light,\nDivine transformations beget life,\nAble to ride clouds and float,\nPlayfully ascending the Upper Clarity.*\nUpon completion, tilt the head to swallow the nine qi and cease.\n\nAfter nine years of cultivation, one’s ascent moves the nine heavens, and the divine true beings descend to bestow upon the practitioner the *True Writ*, naturally enabling one to ride the nine-colored cloud chariot and soar through the *Upper Clarity*.\n\nThe *Jade True Nine-Heaven Elder*, the qi of the *Purple Void*, bears the secret name *Prolonging the World’s Radiance* and the style *Linked to the Upper*, his form spanning ninety million *zhang*. In the three months of winter, he dons a *Flying Essence Hundred-Transformations Crown*, a nine-colored, naturally luminous brocade robe, and wields the *Ninefold Primordial Penetrating Truth Talisman*. He ever rides five-colored clouds, seated upon nine-colored mists, his luminosity blazing in the *Upper Clarity*, visualized as nine inches in length. In the three months of spring, the *Jade True Nine-Heaven Elder* transforms into a phoenix with a single body and nine heads, each head crowned with the nine qi of *Mysterious Essence*, clad in a nine-colored, feather-patterned robe. He ever rides twelve flying *lin* beasts, seated upon five-colored lotuses, his luminosity streaming with a hundred shifting hues in the *Upper Clarity*’s *Purple Void*, visualized as reverting to his true form. In the three months of summer, the *Jade True Nine-Heaven Elder* transforms into a dragon-bodied, human-headed form, crowned with twelve-colored light, clad in azure, yellow, and purple feathered robes, his mouth holding a plain sash. He ever rides nine-colored clouds, seated upon five-colored lions, his light illuminating the *Upper Clarity*, visualized as reverting to his true form. In the three months of autumn, the *Jade True Nine-Heaven Elder* transforms into a radiance of purple and emerald hues, his qi intertwining like the sun and moon overlapping—this is the reversion of the *Purple Void*’s qi, where he refines and receives the essence of the nine heavens, visualized as reverting to his true form.\n\nTo practice the Dao of the *Jade True Nine-Heaven Elder*, on the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter), bathe and enter the chamber, face the northwest, and pay homage to the *Nine-Heaven Elder* with nine bows. Then turn north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the *Nine-Heaven Elder*’s four-seasonal forms in the *Upper Clarity*’s *Cinnabar Numinous Palace*, *Opening Clarity Mansion*, *Triune Harmony Hamlet*, *Obscure Truth Village*, where he revolves the true and descends to illuminate one’s *Cavern Chamber*. Silently recite the invocation:\n*Numinous One of the Nine Heavens, Primordial and self-so,\nContaining and refining the eight Dao, ninefold true embryonic immortals,\nThe central treasure of purple primal essence, the threefold pure encircling without,\nTransforming effulgence, refining qi,\nFlowing in harmony with cyclic revolutions,\nPenetrating transformations, entering the subtle,\nMy Dao is early apportioned,\nEyes summoning numinous radiance,\nHeart parting the five clouds,\nUrging the talisman to enter the effulgence,\nSoaring into the imperial dawn.*\nUpon completion, tilt the head to swallow the nine qi and cease.\n\nOne who knows the inner secret names and styles of the *Nine-Heaven Elder*’s transformations shall have their name inscribed in the nine heavens. After nine years of cultivation, one may behold the true divine, ride the void to soar, and ascend to the *Jade Clarity*.\n\nThe *Dao-Root Nine-Heaven Primordial Father*, the qi of the *Cavern Root*, bears the secret name *Ninefold Numinous Guide* and the style *Chaos Great True*, his form spanning ninety million *zhang*. In the three months of spring, he dons a *Sevenfold Vermilion Jade Headband*, the *Boundless Treasure Heaven Crown*, robes of *Nine-Heaven Phoenix Garments* and *Divine Cloud Phoenix Sandals*, and a plain numinous sash. He ever rides a *Flying Jade Canopy*, followed by twelve flying dragons, seated upon nine-colored floral radiance in the *Jade Clarity* above, his luminosity a hundred shifting hues, blazing through the great void, visualized as nine feet in length.\n\nIn the three months of summer, the *Primordial Father* transforms his form into one body with nine heads, each head crowned with a sun. He wears a robe of red phoenixes and tiger-fur patterned with striped markings, and a sash of twelve colors. He rides a nine-colored phoenix, seated upon the convergence of yellow and white qi. His radiance blazes through the void, illuminating the *Jade Clarity* within. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the three months of autumn, the *Primordial Father* divides his form into nine figures, all clad in nine-colored feathered robes. Each bears a *Dragon Abyss Sword* at the waist, a tiger-headed pouch, and a plain numinous sash interwoven with divine essence. Seated upon the nine qi of the dark void, their luminosity shifts in a hundred hues, shining resplendent within the subtle realms of the *Jade Clarity* and the depths of the *Cavern Root*.

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Transformations and Treasured True Essence**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Transformations and Treasured True Essence*. Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. Compiled as a single fascicle from the first volume of *The Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise*. Base text from *The Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*. Collated with *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Transformations and Treasured True Essence, the Nine Numinous and Most Wondrous Mysterious Register of Mount Tortoise* #1.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Transformations and Treasured True Essence**\n\nThe sacred scriptures of Supreme Clarity arose at the inception of the Nine Heavens, born of spontaneity and coexisting with qi. The Three Radiant Ones shone in unison, manifesting above the Nine Heavens and within the Great Void. At times, they coalesced into soaring dark-purple qi, forming numinous texts—celestial writings of ineffable subtlety, their strokes sinuous and intricate. Each character spanned a *zhang* in size, their details elusive; none but the Perfected Kings of the Nine Heavens could fathom their profound resonance.\n\nIn the first year of the *Shangxu* era, the Perfected Kings of the Nine Heavens commanded the Supreme Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Capital to cast golden tablets. The assembled sages clarified their meanings, and the Highest Oral Instructions were compiled into numinous chapters. The Jade Emperor inscribed them with his brush, engraving the tablets into scripture. Their structure—with its elevations and descents, ranks and prohibitions—all derived from the esoteric decrees of the Most High Sages. Sealed within the Jade Chamber of the Celestial Palace above the Nine Heavens, they were guarded by the Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence and the Purple Lads of the Golden Dawn of the Primordial Numinous Palace.\n\nMount Tortoise of the West—also called Dragon Mountain—serves as the root and pivot of the Nine Heavens, the abyssal repository of the myriad qi. Located at the northwest corner of the heavens, it spans four hundred thousand *li* in circumference, its summit contiguous with the Jade Clarity. To the southeast, it adjoins the rosy clouds of the Yang-Pervading Realm, ascending to the Gate of the Divine Tiger of the Azure Palace. To the northwest, it intersects the Frigid Wastes, rising to the Court of the Immortals of the Golden Portals. To the south, it extends to the Crimson Floating Pear Realm, its qi harmonizing with the radiance of the Cavernous Yang. To the north, it points toward the Celestial Enclosure, linking with the Canopy of Flowers, its qi traversing the Vast Numinous. At its center, it aligns directly with the Eightfold Crossroads of the Jade Capital atop the summit of the Intersecting Winds Mountain. Thirty thousand *li* of level heavens are walled in smelted gold and gated in carved jade, adorned with golden terraces, jade towers, and twelve divine palaces.\n\nAbove stand the naturally flowing Essence-Purple Towers and Golden Florescence Halls, chambers of chalcedony and jasper, flanked by nine cavernous grottoes. Spontaneous purple clouds arise, interwoven with phoenix-script, their nine hues cascading in array. Cliffs bear purple cassia, ridges flourish with jasper groves, their branches formed of coral, their roots of jade. The trees of the *qian* groves bear fruit, their boughs laden with white jade rings. The Three Florescence blossoms gleam in the crimson radiance, while reverse fragrance flows through the Great Mystery. The Eight Qi fan the whirlwinds, and jade flutes resound in the void, composing celestial music. Dragons roar upon cloud towers, phoenixes cry from perilous peaks. Venomous beasts gather in the thousands, serpents coil a thousand *xun* in length. Divine palaces stand majestic, cloud-borne immortals swarm in profusion. The towering Primordial Halls brim with emanations, for this is the wondrous transformation of the Primordial Origin, the true numinous root of the Celestial Origin.\n\nWithin the Golden Florescence Hall, above the northern window, a spontaneous purple qi coalesces into mysterious script. Characters a *zhang* in size descend in radiant splendor, their celestial writing of ineffable subtlety, beyond mortal comprehension.\n\nIn the first year of the *Shangjia* era, the Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens fasted in the Cloud Palace and feasted in the radiance of Mount Tortoise. There, he inscribed golden tablets and transcribed the mysterious script, resolving its long-standing obscurities and expounding its numinous resonance. It was recorded as *The Crimson Sovereign’s Flying Dark-Purple Writ of Mount Tortoise*.\n\nOn the first *yin* day of the first month of the first year of the *Kaihuang* era, the Queen Mother of the West rode the void in numinous flight, soaring through the Nine Empyreans. She fasted upon Mount Tortoise and ascended the naturally flowing Essence-Purple Tower and Golden Florescence Jasper Hall. Gazing upon the northern window, she paid homage to the mysterious script, contemplating the cliffs in reverence and meditating upon the Supreme Perfected Ones. Thereupon, her wondrous perception awakened, and her cinnabar heart revealed its truth. Suddenly, a Great Divine Perfected One of Heaven appeared, girded with the sun and moon, a halo encircling his neck. Preceded by a retinue of feather-canopied immortals, he arrived upon a flying chariot of ninefold purple clouds, trailing auroral radiance. Kneeling before the Queen Mother, he announced: \"I am the Perfected King of the Phoenix Palace of the Nine Heavens, surnamed Supreme Mystery, styled Open Brightness. By command of the Primordial Heavenly King, I bear the Nine Heavens’ Golden Writ in purple characters on azure-golden cinnabar tablets, to bestow upon the Queen Mother.\" He conferred upon her the title *Supreme Perfected Mother of the Nine Numinous Ones of the Western Origin* and enfeoffed her as the Peak of Western Tortoise. He also bestowed a plain writ containing *The Primordial Record of the Supreme Perfected One’s Transformations at Birth*, entrusting her with the oversight of the immortal registers and the succession of the Jade Clarity.\n\nAdditionally, he presented her with azure-jade tablets, a *feng*-robe of flying azure feathers, a Morning Infant Jade Crown, phoenix-cloud sandals, a divine phoenix-purple wheel, a flying feathered canopy of twenty-four carriages, and five-colored banners of numinous command. He further assigned seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace’s Golden Florescence to attend the Perfected Mother, who was to govern the flowing Essence-Purple Tower and Golden Florescence Jasper Hall. Thrice each month, she would ascend to the Jade Clarity, twice feast upon Kunlun, and five times review the assembled immortals.\n\nWhen the Great Divine Perfected One had completed his mission, he returned to his jade palace. The Perfected Mother then ascended her throne and addressed the assembly in the Jasper Hall. She commanded her attendants, the Jade Lad Deng and Dong Shuangcheng, to receive with reverence the golden writ in purple characters on azure-jade tablets, the azure-golden cinnabar writ of imperial bestowal, *The Primordial Record of the Supreme Perfected One’s Transformations at Birth*, and the *Flying Dark-Purple Writ*—four items in total—wrapped in a cinnabar-sovereign seal and enshrined within the chalcedony chamber. She assigned thirty Jade Maidens of the Golden Florescence and thirty Purple Dawn Jade Lads to guard the numinous script. Following the ancient statutes of the Three Heavens’ structural protocols, she reported to the Five Emperors, the Five Peaks, the numinous mountains, rivers, and seas, commanding their deities to submit the names of aspirants five times monthly, distinguishing merits and transgressions by rank for memorialization.\n\nOn each of the eight solar terms, and five times each month, the Perfected Mother feasted in the Cloud Palace, traversing the Five Peaks, surveying the sources of rivers, and gazing upon the eight directions. At such times, the Five Planets aligned, the sun and moon paused in their radiance, the hundred yangs discharged lightning, molten gold gleamed with essence, Heavenly Soldiers led the vanguard, and the Five Elders bore banners. The Perfected Mother ever rode her nine-hued chariot of purple-cloud flying wheels, attended by five thousand Jade Maidens of the Celestial Immortals.",

Reed pipes, flutes, drums, and winds blended in harmonious tones, while luan birds sang and phoenixes cried, their voices ringing through the cloud formations. Radiant lights intertwined, the Three Luminaries merged in brilliance. Purple youths wafted incense to dispel impurities, while divine consorts scattered blossoms to bathe the perfected. Heavenly chimes resounded beneath their banners, purple mists veiled the empty courtyard, jade effulgences streamed across the firmament, and numinous transformations subdued the myriad spirits.\n\nAt such times, the Six Heavens obeyed her command, all malevolent forces shrank in form, demons and monsters lost their sight, the heavens cleared, and the air grew pure—truly the wondrous spectacle of lofty immortals, the luminous numen of the Cinnabar Sovereign manifest in its full glory.\n\n**The Cinnabar Sovereign of Tortoise Mountain’s Flying Mystery Purple Writ**\n*Flying Mystery Purple Qi congeals the numinous root,*\n*The net of Jade Clarity governs the myriad spirits.*\n*In the void, it surges and coalesces of itself;*\n*Above, twelve towering peaks stand in succession.*\n\n*Jade towers soar resplendent in luminous clouds,*\n*Flowing essence graces the purple palace with golden eaves.*\n*The jasper hall gleams with the brilliance of the Eight Transcendents;*\n*Within, the Nine Numinous Immortals of Azure Gold emerge.*\n\n*The Cinnabar Sovereign True Mother is named Essence-Prolonging,*\n*Clad in flying azure feathered robes, crowned with the Morning Infant’s diadem.*\n*In her left hand she holds the jade scepter, in her right the numinous banner;*\n*Five-colored spirits command the demons, attending the August Honored One.*\n\n*Grasping talismans and registers at the Gate of Life,*\n*She chews the moon and sucks the sun, inhaling jade springs.*\n*The Net of Separation exhales radiance to refine the five souls;*\n*Within, it fills and overflows, delighting the Crimson Palace.*\n\n*Golden light shines resplendent, her form perfectly round.*\n*From the new moon she enters the Metal phase, its color turbid and dim—*\n*Only the Enlightened One at dawn speaks of this.*\n*On the fifth day of the fifth month, the Northern Primordial’s essence,*\n*The inscribed canopy appears, leading the immortals.*\n\n*Purple Qi revolves leftward with the Dipper’s motion,*\n*Passing through the four sevens to enter the Golden Gate.*\n*Just then, the Cinnabar Sovereign reviews the myriad immortals;*\n*Those who understand this secret must redouble their diligence.*\n\n*Clothe your form and concentrate your thoughts, ever keeping them distinct;*\n*When wondrous visions respond, grasp the essential writ.*\n*After three years, you shall surely preserve your wholeness;*\n*After nine years, you shall ascend through the void to don the feathered skirt.*\n\n*Lightly soaring in phoenix robes, you shall ascend Dragon Mountain,*\n*Gazing up and down to the Nine Numinous Ones, you shall pay homage to the Jade Dawn.*\n*The Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen declared:*\n*This is the writ of congealed Purple Qi and Flying Mystery, inscribed upon the western Tortoise Mountain, flowing essence upon the northern window of the Purple Palace’s Golden Flower Jasper Hall. The Nine Heavens’ Celestial Venerable beheld its chapters and recorded it as the* Tortoise Mountain Cinnabar Sovereign’s Flying Mystery Purple Writ.\n\n*The Queen Mother of the West ever treasured and concealed it; its purport is profound and recondite, all being the subtle rhymes of the Nine Heavens. Without immortal rank, one may not so much as glance at its title. Those who obtain it are all recorded in the Nine Heavens’ registers, their names inscribed upon Tortoise Mountain.*\n\n*The Nine Heavens’ Celestial Venerable instructed:*\n*Practice this Way during the ten months of the year—namely, the first through ninth months, and the eleventh and twelfth months. On the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month—five times monthly—purify yourself and recite the Mystery Writ once. After midnight, go forth into the central courtyard, gaze upward, and await the Purple Cloud Qi within the Canopy of the Northern Dipper. Observe it revolving leftward from the Dipper’s handle, passing through the twenty-eight lunar lodges in sequence, and returning above the Golden Gate. If the sky is overcast and no light appears, perform this inwardly within your chamber, visualizing the method as above with utmost clarity. Upon completing the visualization, bow four times toward the Purple Cloud, click your teeth thrice, and raise your gaze to pray:*\n\n*This night is clear and bright, the hidden void reveals the true;*\n*Flowing clouds drift and linger, golden flowers unfold on four sides.*\n*The Cinnabar Sovereign spreads its radiance, the numinous flies in the purple chariot.*\n*This evening, it unfolds and arrays itself; Azure Gold confers immortality.*\n*Fulfill my supreme aspiration, may my body accord with spontaneity.*\n*Bind my life to the moon’s essence, preserve the root of my years and days.*\n*May the Three Numinous Ones merge in splendor, eternally abiding on Dragon Mountain.*\n*In the secret night, I don pure vestments—grant my request as spoken.*\n\n*Then draw the Purple Qi into your mouth and swallow it twenty-eight times. After three years of this practice, divine perfected beings shall descend as omens upon your sleeping mat. Your body shall be enveloped in Purple Qi, your form interwoven with its glow. Your name shall be inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ registers, and you shall surely ascend as an immortal.*\n\n*The Nine Heavens’ Celestial Venerable said:*\n*The heavens’ writs are myriad, each expounding its wonders. Even this single matter suffices to summon numinous perfected beings to descend, to shake their wings in the Nine Empyreans, to soar through the Jade Clarity, and to wander and feast in the Cloud Palace. Were it not a wondrous method, the Queen Mother of the West would not have concealed it within her inner robe, nor would the Great Existence have left its prohibitions unspoken.*\n\n*The Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen said:*\n*The heavens possess clouds of forbidden Qi that encroach upon the divisions of the sun, moon, and five planets. In those regions and kingdoms, there are always those who accord with the Dao and lords who attain immortality. When such signs appear, their images become visible.*\n\n*The Nine Heavens’ Celestial Venerable said:*\n*Upon seeing such clouds, perform the rites and prayers according to the writ—there is no need to wait for an appointed day. Apply yourself diligently, and when the clouds descend, you shall ascend to meet them. Seal this within your heart; do not lightly show it to others. If the Dao is divulged, its numen scatters, and immortals shall have no means to respond.*\n\n**The Highest Primordial Bestows the Azure Gold Cinnabar Sovereign Jade Writ upon the Queen Mother of the West**\n*The Most High Primordial addressed the Numinous Nine Heavens and the Ancestral Void:*\n*The Queen Mother of the West, whose name is Graceful Robe, is the Qi of the Nine Numinous Ones of the Heavens, the coalesced essence of the Western Metal, the embodied bones of Purple Cloud, the refined radiance of the sun’s essence. She inhales and exhales the splendor of the seven luminaries, harmonizes with the morning auroras to feast on the marrow of the sun’s phoenix, and sips the moon’s essence and orchid brain. It congeals within the jade root and golden storehouse, binding and weaving her cinnabar form, her purple heart entwined in eightfold coils. Manifest in the Cinnabar Sovereign’s wondrous chart, she is exalted among the imperial chariots, reposing in the numinous peaks, her heart ashen in the Upper Clarity. Her merits aid the ten thousand kinds, her kindness overflows all living beings. Holding fast to her singular integrity, she endures through kalpas unending. Thus did the Highest Primordial of the Curved Flower bestow upon her this writ.*\n\n*For Graceful Robe’s virtue of Golden Perfection, he conferred upon her the title of Azure Gold Cinnabar Sovereign, the Transcendent Mother of the Nine Numinous Ones of the Western Primordial. He invested her with rulership over Tortoise Mountain, entrusting her with the governance of the primordial registers. In accordance with the rhythms of inhalation and exhalation, he granted her the Azure Jade Tablet inscribed in gold and jade script, the Nine Heavens’ phoenix robes of flying azure feathers, the Morning Infant’s jade crown and phoenix-cloud sandals, twenty-four chariots of divine phoenixes with purple wheels and flying feathered canopies, five-colored staffs and banners as tokens of command over the numinous, flowing-gold fire bells and night-shining candles, jade writs to extinguish demons and Nine Heavens’ imperial decrees as pledges. To guard her, he assigned seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace and Western Flower, who attend her in the Flowing Essence Purple Palace and Golden Flower Palace on Western Tortoise Mountain. Thrice monthly she ascends to the Jade Clarity, twice she feasts on Kunlun. She reviews the multitudes of immortals, and the Five Peaks, rivers, seas, and the deities of the ten directions—none are beyond her governance, as fully set forth in this writ.*",

      "translated_text": "All ritual protocols shall follow the ancient statutes of the Jade Terrace’s *Great Possession* and the orthodox texts of the Three Heavens. The issuance of azure-jade tablets inscribed with golden script and jade characters, the Azure-Golden Cinnabar August Writs—all derive from the celestial norms of the *Great Possession* Palace’s *Yin-Yang* protocols, all composed in the spontaneously generated chapters of the *High Mystery Cavern Void*, to be conferred upon the offices of the loftiest perfected and sagely beings, not bestowed upon novices. Even the Golden Tower’s Eastern Florescence and Square Cauldrons Palaces possess their own ritual protocols for summoning novice ascended immortals. These, too, originate from the *Great Possession*’s norms, differing only in rank and hierarchy.\n\nUnless one’s name is recorded in the Nine Heavens or inscribed in the Square Cauldrons’ registers, one shall never glimpse their contents. Those who obtain sight of their texts are destined for rebirth with inscribed tablets, their names listed in the Emperor’s celestial ledgers, fated to attain divine transcendence—thus preordained in the numinous statutes. On the day of Daoic attainment, celestial perfected beings shall naturally descend to receive their writs and conferred texts.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: The golden script and jade characters are all engraved upon azure-jade tablets, or inscribed upon green-jade tablets. Each tablet measures nine inches and nine fen in length, two inches and four fen in width, with characters threaded in gold. Two jade lads and two jade maidens attend each tablet, managing incense and verifying seals. According to the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, if a qualified recipient exists within a century, a single transmission is permitted.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: Azure-jade is not something worldly beings may employ. If one’s name is recorded in the Square Cauldrons and one gains sight of its texts, one may also engrave them upon green-wood tablets, threading the characters in gold, storing them in a sapphire brocade pouch. After burning incense and performing obeisance for nine years, celestial perfected beings shall naturally descend to bestow the azure-jade tablets.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: The primordial registers of incipient transformation and the *Nine Qi*’s *Primordial Cavern* arose together. The Supreme Jade Emperor, the august sagely and imperial perfected, all compose their names and titles from the *Primordial Cavern*’s qi, while their robes, crowns, and adornments derive from the *Great Possession*’s *Yin-Yang* ritual protocols. Even their native villages and district names arise spontaneously. Heaven possesses the qi of the Eight Assemblies and the revolutions of the Four Epochs, which govern the Jade Void, divide and regulate yin and yang, initiate the mysterious transformations, and engender the myriad forms. The transformations and luminous manifestations of the loftiest sages shift with the four seasons, aligning with cosmic revolutions and celestial decrees, advancing with the flux of change—without aging or decline, enduring eternally in transformation. Thus it is said: *The Dao has no constant name*—this is what it means.\n\nThe Queen Mother’s virtue repays the High Mystery, making her the mother of the myriad qi. Therefore, the Primordial Commencement conferred the title of Cinnabar August upon her, bestowing a scroll of the *Primordial Writ of Plain Text* to transmit to later sagely and transcendent disciples, so they may know that the Primordial Commencement’s Dao composes spontaneously generated titles and possesses the qi of transformation. Those who glimpse its chapters shall have their names pre-inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ immortal ledgers and engraved upon the Cinnabar Terrace of the Square Cauldrons. By refining their concentrated thought without exceeding nine years, they shall attain the privilege of beholding the perfected in their chambers, transforming with the four seasons and soaring through the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: The High Mystery’s precious scriptures of the *Upper Clarity*’s Dao employ visualization as resonance and qi-swallowing as convergence. Once one gains access to their contents, one should immediately clarify the visualized images of the Primordial Commencement’s transformations, discerning their forms, colors, luminous qi, and adornments as they shift with the four seasons. Then, upon closing the eyes and refraining from speech, they shall naturally arrive; upon swallowing qi without deliberate induction, they shall naturally converge. If one does not behold the divine within a decade, or if one’s qi does not flourish within a month—later learners and worthies may yet diligently refine their thought, for the namable exists within the *Mysterious Void*, and the means to transcendence shall arise.\n\nThe Southern Culmen’s Supreme Primordial Sovereign said: Those who cultivate the Dao of upper transcendence—visualizing deities, invoking the perfected, ingesting qi, and swallowing saliva—yet remain ignorant of the Primordial Commencement’s titles, the root origins of the four seasons’ transformations, shifting luminous manifestations, and qi, merely close their eyes in vast obscurity, swallow emptily without intent—how shall the perfected deities descend? How shall qi and saliva flourish? Facing one another with gazes, there is already dimness; how much more so in the boundless expanse, where forms and qi remain undifferentiated? Such efforts are but futile exertions in repose, profitless in empty recitation.\n\n**The Primordial Register of the Upper Clarity’s Incipient Transformations**\n\nThe Primordial August Supreme Elder, the qi of the Primordial Jade Void, tabooed name *Yanshiyin*, styled *Guanwu Jue*, stands nine thousand myriad zhang in height. During the three months of spring, he wears the *Nine Qi*’s *Flowing Essence Purple Radiance* crown, robes of nine-light brocade, and a sash of naturally seamless nine-colored silk, girded with *Six Mountains Fire Jade*. He perpetually rides clouds of azure and verdant hues, and when seated, nine-colored lions radiate dazzling brilliance. In the *Upper Clarity*’s *Jade Void*, when visualized, he returns to a height of nine inches and nine fen.\n\nDuring the three months of summer, the Primordial August Supreme Elder transforms into a single body with nine heads, standing seven thousand zhang tall, crowned with nine-colored clouds, clad in a robe of cinnabar brocade woven with hundredfold luminous transformations, girded with the *Nine Great Immortals’ Refined Sword*, riding clouds of cinnabar and purple hues, seated upon nine-colored dragons, their radiance flowing and resplendent. In the *Jade Void*’s purple clouds, when visualized, he returns to a height of nine inches.\n\nDuring the three months of autumn, the Supreme Elder transforms into a single body with nine phoenix heads, standing five thousand zhang tall, clad in tiger robes of nine-colored stripes, riding seven-colored clouds, their radiant splendor intermingling. In the *Upper Clarity* above, when visualized, he returns to a height of seven inches and seven fen.\n\nDuring the three months of winter, the Supreme Elder transforms into a luminous manifestation of azure and black hues, vibrant as the moon’s essence—this is the reversion of the *Jade Void*’s qi, where he refines and receives the Primordial Commencement’s essence. When visualized, he reverts to his original primordial true form.\n\nTo cultivate the Dao of the Primordial Commencement, on the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), bathe and enter the chamber, face east, and pay homage to the Primordial August Supreme Elder with nine bows.

His radiance blazes through the void, illuminating the *Jade Clarity* within. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the three months of autumn, the *Primordial Father* divides his form into nine figures, all clad in nine-colored feathered robes. Each bears a *Dragon Abyss Sword* at the waist, a tiger-headed pouch, and a plain numinous sash interwoven with divine essence. Seated upon the nine qi of the dark void, their luminosity shifts in a hundred hues, shining resplendent within the subtle realms of the *Jade Clarity* and the depths of the *Cavern Root*. When visualized, he reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the three months of winter, the *Primordial Father* transforms into the radiance of solar essence, merging with the purple brilliance.

Then turn north, sit evenly, close the eyes, and visualize the *Nine-Heaven Father* assuming his four seasonal forms above the *Nine Heavens*, within the *Great Ultimate Jade Palace*, the *Jade Treasure Treasury* of the *Cinnabar Spirit Village* in the *Cavern Origin Hamlet*. As his true form descends in reflection, it enters the adept’s *Upper Origin* within *Kunlun*, whereupon one softly intones:\n\n*\"Supreme August Thearch, Primordial Great Divinity,\nConjoined with true qi, your form graces the purple heavens.\nRiding clouds and driving the floating, you weave through the eight mists.\nTurning the wheel, you descend in arcs, your Dao shading my body.\nMay I ascend in the cloud chariot, serving the divine axle.\nOn this day of the Eight Assemblies, I humbly present my supreme wishes.\nAll that I seek and beseech shall be granted by your grace.\nMay I eternally enjoy primal fortune, abiding with the Thearch,\nCommanding the Eight Effulgences to soar into the *Jade Dawn*.\"*\n\nWhen finished, tilt the head back and swallow nine breaths.\n\nAfter nine years of practice, one beholds the true form, and the *Primordial Father* descends to one’s side, conversing with the adept.

She ever rides twelve-colored clouds, seated amidst a hundred shifting luminosities that illuminate the subtle realms of the *Upper Clarity* within. When visualized, she reverts to her true form.\n\nIn the three months of spring, the *Mystic Mother* transforms into a phoenix-bodied, qilin-headed figure, resplendent in seven colors and twelve effulgences, her radiant essence interwoven and shining through the subtle realms of the *Upper Clarity* and the depths of the *Eight Obscurities*. When visualized, she reverts to her true form.\n\nIn the three months of summer, the *Mystic Mother* transforms into a dual radiance of purple and yellow, like the moon’s brilliance, flowing in five hues that illuminate the *Upper Clarity*. This manifests the reversed form of the *Mystic Mother*’s *Cavern Origin* qi, which further refines the essence of the *Dao-Pole Nine Yin*. The *Feminine One* unites in celebration, giving birth to the myriad spirits. When visualized, she reverts to her true form. After nine years, the *Primordial Father* bears the register in *Nanyang*, and the *Mystic Mother* descends in form to the *Cinnabar Chamber*.\n\nTo practice the *Mystic Mother*’s Dao, on one’s *Life-Destiny Day*, bathe and purify oneself, enter the chamber, and face the southeast to pay homage to the *Mystic Mother* with nine bows.

Close the eyes and visualize the *Nine-Heaven Mystic Mother* assuming her four seasonal forms above the *Nine Heavens*, within the *Jasper Grove Sevenfold Radiance Palace*, the *Jade Treasure Cavern Origin Treasury* of the *Nine-Light Village* in the *Upper Clarity Hamlet*. As her true form descends in reflection, it enters the adept’s *Gate of Life* below the navel within the *Cinnabar Field Palace*, whereupon one softly intones:\n\n*\"Triple union and quintuple separation, the dual origins merge in transformation.\nQi congeals and spirit coalesces; spirit transforms and merges with the hun-soul.\nThe Feminine One embraces the true, the womb’s breath births the gate.\nYin essence mystically descends, washing and irrigating the wellsprings of form.\nRefining and transmuting, the luminous effulgence arises naturally.\nToday I humbly present my plea; may the Mystic Mother grant my wishes.\nTwelve supreme vows safeguard the completion of my jade perfection.\nFive forms receive the radiant blessings, my bones refined into jade immortality.\nLight of body, I soar and fly, riding the void and weaving through the mists.\nAscending to the Purple Ultimate, I attend upon the divine countenance.\"*\n\nWhen finished, tilt the head back and swallow twenty-seven breaths.\n\nAfter nine years of practice, the *Mystic Mother* is moved to joy, and the two effulgences unite in harmony. She commands the *Northern Thearch* to erase the adept’s name from the registers of death, presenting the *Nine Heavens Record* inscribed on purple tablets. One beholds her true form and soars into the *Upper Clarity*.\n\nTo recklessly divulge this Dao is to be consigned to the *River Source* in death, with seven generations bearing servitude, enduring ten sufferings and eight calamities—blade mountains and sword trees—through ten thousand kalpas without redemption.

The Lofty One streams forth essence, blending and reverting to the womb, receiving refinement and transformation, cycling through four revolutions.

Five talismans interlace, nourishing my form; the Three Palaces and Eight Sceneries convey the purple chariot. I don the feathered garb of flying immortals, emerald skirts and azure brocade, twin pendants tied with sashes, golden talismans and jade bells.

The true light descends, illuminating the nine apertures of the practitioner’s origin and the upper pass. Then softly recite:\n\nThe ninefold Dao radiates luminous,\nthe Purple Clarity branches and flows.\nThe three qi merge in primordial chaos,\nuniting with the true and profound pivot.\nMysterious numen spreads primordial essence,\ndispersing and transforming the Upper Void.\nThe Peerless One escorts the Elder,\nthe White Prime transmits the talisman.\nThe Controller of Destinies inspects life,\nthe five spirits bathe the body.\nThe Dao unites to perfect the true,\nthe Primordial Emperor becomes my peer.\nAbove, I ascend to the mysterious chart,\nflying and ascending to the Great Vastness.\n\nUpon completion, raise the head and swallow the nine qi to cease.

The true light descends, illuminating the upper origin blood and fluid palace of the practitioner.

      "translated_text": "The Jade Clarity Supreme Great Dao Lord, primordial qi of the numinous void, bears the taboo name Yin Xian and the style Bo Ku Yuan, standing ninety million zhang in height. In the autumn’s three months, his head is crowned with the Hundred-Transformations Divine Radiance Jade Coronet; he wears the Flying Frost-Pearl Robe, a seven-hued tiger-garment, and the Nine-Colored Departing-Silk Sash; girded with Morning-Light Moon-Bright Bells, he sits upon seven-colored clouds, his luminous radiance streaming through the Upper Clarity. Meditate upon him until he returns to nine inches in length.\n\nIn the winter’s three months, the Supreme Dao Lord transforms his form: his head bears the Seven-Light Round Wheel, his body clad in a thirty-two-hued dharma-robe, standing atop a nine-colored lion. His radiant brilliance shines within the Upper Clarity above the Grand Tenuity. Meditate until he reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the spring’s three months, the Supreme Great Dao Lord transforms into Lord Lao, his head wrapped in a horned kerchief, his body robed in tiger-patterned garments, holding a golden talisman, standing upon the Five Mushroom Flowers. Meditate until he reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the summer’s three months, the Supreme Great Dao Lord transforms into a dual radiance of purple and yellow, their luminous splendor intertwining, dwelling within the Purple Void. There he reverts to the qi of Jade Clarity, refining anew the essence of the numinous void. Meditate until he reverts to his true form.\n\nTo cultivate the Way of the Great Dao Lord, on the eight seasonal nodes and one’s natal day, bathe and enter the chamber, bow twice facing north, and pay homage to the Jade Clarity Lord. Then sit upright facing north, tap the teeth nine times, and meditate upon the Jade Clarity Lord’s four seasonal forms and shadows within the Upper Clarity’s Elixir-Pearl Palace, Sun-Gate Ward, Purple Radiance Hamlet, and Golden Light Precinct. His truth returns, descending to illuminate the twelve beams beyond your neck. Softly intone:\n\n*\"Jade Clarity girds the lofty numen,\nMastering truth to steer the Eight Clarities.\nJade blossoms drape the cinnabar chamber,\nPurple phoenixes illumine cloud encampments.\nHe leads the mystic metropolis’ perfected,\nTogether refining cinnabar’s essence.\nFollowing five spirits’ transformations,\nThey tend the radiance of the supreme numina.\nThe primordial Dao’s boundless directions,\nSubtly quicken my wondrous existence.\nLife’s immortals cross the talismanic registers,\nInscribing your form and name.\"*\n\nWhen finished, tilt the head back and swallow the qi five times, then cease. This is the exalted Jade Canon; those who know it enjoy longevity of ten thousand years. Cultivating it for nine years, one soars through the Upper Clarity. To lightly disclose its utmost subtlety is to forfeit transcendence in death.\n\nThe Central Yellow Elder Lord, primordial qi of the Five Radiances, bears the taboo name Qi Ying Sheng and the style Yun Jiu Ye, standing thirty million zhang in height. In the summer’s three months, his head is crowned with the Precious Coral Morning Coronet; he wears a nine-hued cloud-garment of patterned fur, girded with the Intertwined Numen Purple Sash and twelve-hued floral radiance, ever standing atop five-colored lions. His luminous radiance streams through the Upper Clarity. Meditate upon him until he returns to three inches and three fen in length.\n\nIn the autumn’s three months, the Central Yellow Elder Lord transforms into a Jade Youth, his head adorned with Seven Essences’ blossoms, clad in a Flying Celestial Feather Robe, holding a floral banner. Meditate until he reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the winter’s three months, the Central Yellow Elder transforms into a Great Immortal, his entire body golden-hued, wearing seven-colored robes, his neck bearing a halo of radiance, his feet treading upon lotus blossoms. His luminous brilliance streams forth. Meditate until he reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the spring’s three months, the Central Yellow Elder Lord transforms into intertwining lights of purple, green, and blue, dwelling above the Jade Void. There he reverts to the qi of the Center, refining anew the essence of the primordial Five Radiances. Meditate until he reverts to his true form.\n\nTo cultivate the Way of the Yellow Elder Lord, on Geng Shen and Jia Zi days, bathe and enter the chamber, bow thrice facing northeast, and pay homage to the Yellow Elder Lord. Then sit upright facing north, tap the teeth twelve times, and cease. Meditate upon the Yellow Elder Lord’s four seasonal forms and shadows within the Upper Clarity’s Empty Radiance Palace, Golden Pearl Ward, Supreme Essence Hamlet, and Prosperous Joy Precinct. His truth returns, descending to illuminate the four poles within your chest. Softly intone:\n\n*\"Grand Clarity links the Jade Void,\nMysterious numina scatter the cinnabar palace.\nFour transformations diverge and flow,\nEach metamorphosis alters its constant form.\nWondrous scenes ride the numinous vast,\nMerging to birth the emptiness-same.\nAttaining truth lies in resonant meeting,\nHigh and low mystically complete the pair.\nIn tranquil contemplation, the self’s form vanishes,\nThe heart aspires to the Dark Ridge’s peak.\"*\n\nWhen finished, swallow the qi five times, then cease. Knowing the Yellow Elder’s four transformations, one enjoys longevity of ten thousand years. Cultivating his Way, one soars through the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe Supreme Ultimate Great Dao Primordial Radiance Lord, primordial qi of the Upper Fusion, bears the taboo name Dao Da Shi and the style Du Da Ming, standing thirty million zhang in height. In the autumn’s three months, his head is crowned with the Morning Infant Precious Coronet; he wears a seamless nine-hued unlined robe, bears the Divine Tiger’s Upper Talisman, and girds the Precious Immortal’s Sword. A flowing-golden radiance encircles his neck, illuminating seventy-four directions. He stands atop a dark turtle. Meditate upon him until he returns to three inches and three fen in length.\n\nIn the winter’s three months, the Great Dao Primordial Radiance Lord transforms into a tiger-headed dragon-bodied form, five-hued patterns adorning him, illuminating the Upper Clarity. Meditate until he reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the spring’s three months, the Great Dao Primordial Radiance Lord transforms into Lord Lao, his hair unbound to his waist, clad in a Flying Azure Feather Robe, standing upon purple clouds. Meditate until he reverts to his true form.\n\nIn the summer’s three months, the Great Dao Primordial Radiance Lord transforms into intertwining lights of red and blue, their chaotic brilliance intertwining, dwelling above the Purple Void. There he reverts to the qi of the Supreme Ultimate, refining anew the essence of the primordial Upper Fusion. Meditate until he reverts to his true form.\n\nTo cultivate the Way of the Primordial Radiance Lord, on the day of Autumn’s Beginning, bathe and enter the chamber, bow twice facing west, and pay homage to the Primordial Radiance Lord. Then sit upright facing north, tap the teeth three times, and meditate upon the Primordial Radiance Lord’s four seasonal forms and shadows within the Upper Clarity’s Longevity Palace, Eight Misty Ward, Supreme Origin Hamlet, and Assembly Numen Precinct. His truth returns, descending to illuminate the gate of your stomach’s membrane. Softly intone:\n\n*\"Primordial Radiance pierces the mysterious,\nNine subtleties refine the form.\nFour movements transform and change,\nFollowing qi to alter life.\nBirth and truth merge as one,\nStreaming radiance through the eight darks.\nI ride the auspicious day,\nAscending to report to the imperial numen.\nSeeking immortality and ascension,\nEight radiant scenes converge.\nTen thousand wishes gather,\nAttaining to steer the flowing chariot,\nAscending into the Nine Voids,\nTo pay homage to the Three Clarities.\"*",

Knowing the Dao of the Dao Center Lord’s four transformations, one may enjoy longevity of ten thousand years. Practicing to induce spirit descent, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight.",
