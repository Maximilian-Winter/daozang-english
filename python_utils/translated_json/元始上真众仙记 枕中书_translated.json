In an instant, purple clouds enveloped the forest, and a perfected one appeared—his pupils square, his neck bearing a halo of radiance, his celestial countenance unmatched in the world. He rode a chariot drawn by a white unicorn, bearing a banner with nine yak-tail streamers, his waist girded with a brocade sash embroidered with jade-script phoenixes. Upon his head rested a crown of sixfold penetration, and though his age seemed scarcely twenty, his attendants—bearing luminous torches and jade-feathered guards numbering a thousand—followed in his train. He called himself the *Great Perfected King of the Mysterious Capital* and asked: *\"Are you Ge Hong? Why do you seek everlasting existence?\"*\n\nHong bowed deeply, prostrating himself in reverence, and knelt to perform the rites.\n\nThe divine being addressed me, saying: *\"You are one of those blessed by the auspicious qi of the Nine Heavens, born to an extraordinary destiny. After another thousand years, the Supreme Clarity will record your name among the Immortals. Now, you must soon depart this world and relocate to the western lands. There, we shall meet upon the heights of Mount Taihua, within the Crimson Palace. For the time being, return to your duties, leaving behind a simulacrum of yourself in the Dragon Abyss. Depart in secret and silence, so none may recognize your true form.*\n\n*You have delved deeply into the ancient classics, your wisdom surpassing the common throng. You untangle knots of confusion and awaken to mysteries—truly, you possess wondrous talent. Yet you remain unaware of the palaces of the Perfected Immortals or the origins of the Supreme Sages. Now, I must depart, and our shared endeavors cannot last much longer.\"*\n\nHong prostrated himself and kowtowed. Thereupon, the Perfected One commanded his attendants to take up brush and paper, and he dictated esoteric words. When finished, he placed the text in Hong’s left hand, saying: *\"I now journey to Fangzhang to report to the Immortal Officials. I shall return to visit you again. Strive onward!\"* Then he departed, his chariot ascending slowly into the heights until he vanished from sight.\n\nThe *True Book* states: *\"In the time before the separation of the Two Modes, when primal chaos reigned in murky obscurity, before form took shape, before Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon were complete, all existed in a state like a hen’s egg—hun-tun, dark and yellow. Yet even then, the Perfected Pan Gu, the essence of Heaven and Earth, was present, styling himself the Primordial Heavenly King, wandering within it. After four kalpas, the form of Heaven resembled a vast canopy, unsuspended above, unrooted below. Beyond Heaven and Earth stretched boundless emptiness, infinite and without end—the profound profundity of the Great Void, silent and soundless. The primordial qi surged like water, without mountains below or constellations above. The accumulated qi grew dense and firm, vast and yielding, binding together. Heaven and Earth floated within it, drifting without direction. Without this qi, Heaven and Earth would not have come to be. Heaven was like a dragon, coiling amidst the clouds.*\n\n*After another four kalpas, the Two Modes began to separate, standing thirty-six thousand li apart. The cliffs bled and became water; from the water arose primordial creatures, from which came Bin Qian, then Gang Xu, and from Gang Xu, the dragon. The Primordial Heavenly King dwelled above the center of Heaven, upon a mountain called Jade Capital Peak. Within its palaces, all was adorned with gold and jade. He ever inhaled the qi of Heaven and drank the springs of Earth.*\n\n*After two more kalpas, the Supreme Prime Jade Maiden suddenly emerged from the accumulated blood in a stone ravine. She could speak upon birth, her human form complete, her celestial beauty unmatched. She wandered the depths of the Earth, inhaling the primordial qi of Heaven, and was called the Supreme Prime Holy Mother. The Primordial Lord descended to meet her, and they joined in qi and essence, summoning her to the Upper Palace. At that time, the Two Qi intertwined, nurturing and sustaining all breath. Yin and Yang harmonized, neither hot nor cold. Heaven attained Unity and became clear; Earth attained Unity and became tranquil. No longer did they breathe, but their qi merged and coalesced, naturally achieving fullness. The flourishing of the Great Dao reached its zenith then. Their union was so firm and enduring that it became indestructible.*\n\n*Gold, jade, and pearls are the essence of Heaven and Earth. To consume them is to become one with Heaven and Earth. After one kalpa, the Primordial Lord bestowed upon the Supreme Prime Mother, and she bore thirteen Heavenly Sovereigns, who ruled for thirty-six thousand years. They were recorded as Fuxang the Great Emperor, the Eastern King Lord, known as the Primordial Yang Father. She also bore the Nine Radiance Mystic Maiden, known as the Supreme Perfected Western Queen Mother, the Lady of the Western Han. The Heavenly Sovereigns, thirteen in number, later begot the Earthly Sovereigns, eleven in number, who in turn begot the Human Sovereigns, nine in number. Each ruled for thirty-six thousand years. The Perfected Sages emerged and received the Dao of the celestial patterns. They established the primordial state of non-action, completing the work of Heaven. The celestial texts of the Three Sovereigns transmitted to this day originate from their proclamations. Thus, they could summon the Great Sages of Heaven and the spirits of the Earth, commanding all without exception. Hence, the Heavenly Perfected Humans and the Three Heavenly Perfected Kings ride chariots drawn by nine dragons.*\n\n*Thereafter came the Eight Emperors—Da Ting, Fu Xi, Shen Nong, Zhu Rong, the Five Dragon Clan, and others—who were their descendants and now govern the Five Peaks. Thus, the Dao flourished in the earliest ages, but by the time of the Three Kings, its virtue had declined. The Three Kings were Yu of Xia, Tang of Yin, and Wu of Zhou. As pure customs gave way to decadence, change arose and ritual emerged—yet ritual was the harbinger of chaos. By the end of the Zhou, Yang weakened and Yin grew strong; the land teemed with widows. The western Rong rose with their bronze weapons, and heterodox teachings spread. Soon, the Nine Provinces were submerged, and the imperial enterprise lay in ruins—this prophecy has since been fulfilled. In the age when the Dao flourished, people were simple and uncarved; in the age when heterodox teachings prevailed, the people grew cunning and deceitful.\"*\n\nHong said: *\"These matters are profound and remote, beyond the grasp of ordinary learning. Though I am but a mediocre talent, I have been fortunate to catch the gaze of a Supreme Sage, to discourse upon the hidden mysteries of Heaven and Earth, and to expound the ultimate origins of the most wondrous truths. I shall record your teachings in order, inscribing them upon silk, to preserve them as an eternal treasure. Yet those without the capacity for impartial understanding must never be told of this Primordial Beginning. Thus, I leave these traces to be revealed only to the worthy of the world.\"*\n\n*The True Record* states:\n\nThe Mysterious Capital’s Jeweled Capital Mountain of Seven Treasures spans ninety thousand *li* in circumference and stands above the Great Veil Heaven. Its walls enclose palaces of seven treasures, and within these palaces rise terraces of seven treasures. There are three courts—upper, middle, and lower—forming a single palace-city, each side pierced by two hundred and forty gates. On all four sides grow eight rows of jeweled forests, their leaves verdant and fruits crimson, with five-colored mushroom blossoms. Above them flourish twelve thousand kinds of sacred fungi, while in the pools lotus flowers span ten *zhang* in diameter.\n\nThe Upper Court is governed by Pangu the Perfected, the Primordial Heavenly King, and the Supreme Mysterious Mother; the Middle Court by the Supreme Perfected, the Golden Portal Venerable Lord; and the Lower Court by the Nine Heavens’ Perfected August One and the Three Heavens’ Perfected Kings. The Jeweled Capital contains eight hundred and ten thousand celestial paths, connecting to eight hundred and ten thousand mountain grottoes and chambers. Those great sages who attain the Dao are all granted palaces and residences of seven treasures—some upon the Five Peaks, others within renowned mountains. Wherever sacred herbs grow, there are eight hundred and ten thousand such abodes. As the ancients said, \"Nine nines are eighty-one,\" marking the ultimate celestial path of the Jeweled Capital Mountain.\n\nThose immortals who receive heavenly appointments make thrice-daily audiences at the Mysterious Capital before the Supreme Perfected. Though the distance may span countless *li*, their coming and going are as a single step—how could the worldly ever comprehend this? Some immortals pay thrice-daily homage to the Lord of Fusang, others to the Queen Mother of the West.\n\nThe Golden Portal of the Jeweled Capital is where the Supreme Perfected thrice monthly attend the Primordial Heavenly King. The disciples of the Primordial One are like ministers to an emperor—some serve as Grand Masters, others as Chancellors. The Venerable Lord of the Golden Portal is a disciple of the Supreme One.\n\nThe Great Emperor of Fusang embodies the yang *qi* of the Primordial One and governs the East. Thus, the sons of worldly emperors correspond to the Eastern Palace. The Nine Radiant Lady of the Western Han embodies the primordial yin *qi* and governs the West. Hence, they are called the Lord of Wood and the Mother of Metal—the revered deities of Heaven and Earth. From the refining of primordial *qi* and essence, all things are born; through their harmonizing of yin and yang, the sun and moon shine. None exists apart from them. Their spirit endures eternally, their mandate knows no end. Embracing the One without deviation, they achieve everlastingness.\n\nWhen Heaven loses the balance of yin and yang, floods and droughts become unregulated; when humans lose this balance, their spiritual root and life-force wither. The people of this world cannot preserve the One or uphold the Three, turning life into death—this is only fitting. How can they complain afterward?\n\nWithin the next thousand years, I shall summon you to ascend to the Golden Portal of the Supreme One and feast in the Jeweled Capital. This fleeting moment is but a brief instant—now you may wander the Five Peaks, gather sacred fungi, seek the company of hidden immortals, and roam in effortless freedom. Can my words not be trusted as a promise?\n\nThe Great Emperor of Fusang dwells in the midst of the Azure Sea, his domain spanning thirty thousand *li* on each side. Above stands the Palace of the Supreme Perfected, its walls of azure jade stretching ten thousand *li*. Many forests grow there, their leaves resembling mulberry. There are also *zhen* trees, thousands of *zhang* tall and twenty *wei* in girth, growing in pairs from shared roots, leaning upon one another—hence the name Fusang. Its palaces mirror those of the Jeweled Capital. Countless immortals reside there, and those of the Mysterious Continent and Square Zhang who have not yet ascended to Heaven dwell here as well. It lies sixty thousand *li* from the shores of Kuaiji, governed by the Supreme Clarity’s Immortal Elder, the Supreme Venerable One.\n\nMount Penglai faces the northeastern shore of the Eastern Great Sea. The mountain spans five thousand *li* in circumference, its waves surging into the heavens. It is governed by the Nine *Qi* Venerable One.\n\nThe Mysterious Garden of Kunlun is encircled by a golden embankment-city, a thousand *li* on each side. Upon its walls stand five golden terraces and twelve jade towers, with palaces of luminous jasper, purple-green chambers, and seven-jeweled halls piled high with gold and jade, reaching the heavens. Ten-thousand-*xun* beasts roam there, and incense of a thousand myriad kinds fills the air. It is governed by the Nine Radiant Queen Mother of the West, and countless immortals dwell there.\n\nThe Venerable One of Broad Achievement is now the Perfected of Bell Mountain, the Nine Heavens’ Immortal King. The Four White-Haired Immortals of the Han, Anqi, and Pengzu now assist him there. Wuchengzi and Limozi are the Perfected of Min Mountain. Now, Xuanzhi and Yuzhi serve as its marquises.\n\nFuxi is the Green Emperor, governing Mount Tai; Zhuanxu is the Black Emperor, governing Mount Taiheng; Zhurong is the Red Emperor, governing Mount Heng and Huo; Xuanyuan is the Yellow Emperor, governing Mount Song; and Jintian is the White Emperor, governing Mount Huayin. These five are the Five Emperors.\n\nYao governed Mount Xiong’er; Shun governed Mount Jishi; Yu governed Mount Gaizhu; Tang governed Mount Xuanji; and Qingwu governed Mount Chang and Mount Fengxiu. These five served as the Five Emperors’ ministers and assistants, overseeing their affairs. Every kalpa, the assistants of the Five Emperors are replaced.\n\nXu You and Chao Fu are now the Nine Heavens’ Chamberlains, lords of Mount Ji. Xia Qi and Zhou Fa received the scriptures and became the Four Poles’ Illustrious Lords. Some dwell in Fengdu, others in grotto-heavens.\n\nThe three Zhous’ greatest is the Perfected of Jiangling, and both reside on Mount Jinhua. Emperor Gaozu of Han and Emperor Guangwu are now the Four Illuminations’ honored guests. King Ling of Zhou is now the Supreme Void’s Attendant Gentleman, governing Mount Bolong.\n\nYue Zichang’s entire family attained immortality but have not yet received heavenly appointments, dwelling together in the chambers of Square Zhang. They received the Register of Supreme Mystery on the Divine Continent and subsist on the five sacred fungi.\n\nGuo Jingchun is now the Director of Destinies, governing the Terrace of Emptiness. Zuo Yuanfang is now the Perfected of Heaven’s Pillar, overseeing the Immortal Marquises. Ge Xuan received the Golden Portal Lord’s mandate and became the Supreme Ultimate’s Left Immortal Duke, governing Mount Gaizhu and residing on Mount Nüji, often riding tigers.\n\nXu Ying began as the Immortal of Huolin. Xu Mu established his dwelling in the Huayang Grotto-Heaven and became a Perfected. Xu Yufu resides north of Tongchu, holding the rank of Perfected but without a governing post. Bao Jing is the Master of the Underworld, bearing the title Perfected of Hidden Mountain. After five hundred years, he shall become the Attendant Gentleman of Kunbing.\n\nZheng Siyuan resides in Southern Huo, often riding tigers, leopards, and white deer, yet holds no official post. Cai Yulei is the Ghost Emperor of the East, governing Peach Mound Mountain. Zhang Heng and Yang Yun are the Ghost Emperors of the North, governing Fengdu Mountain. Du Ziren is the Ghost Emperor of the South, governing Mount Luofu and commanding the ghosts of the Qiang and Man tribes. Zhou Qi and Ji Kang are the Ghost Emperors of the Center, governing Mount Baodu. Zhao Wenhe and Perfected Wang are the Ghost Emperors of the West, governing Mount Boyi.\n\nEarthbound immortals roam the Five Peaks, paying morning court to the Queen Mother of the West and resting at dusk upon the slopes of Mount Zhong. Though they have not ascended to Heaven, their joy is beyond words. Even in the courts of Tongchu and the palaces of Yiqian, such bliss alone prevails. Within these sacred mountains, immortals depart year after year, yet mortals neither see nor believe—how lamentable!\n\nThose who study the Dao without regard for body or life, whose hearts and wills remain pure and unsullied—I have never seen them return empty-handed. Yet some practice without diligence, or diligent but unable to cast aside the pleasures of greed; if the three karmic actions and ten evils remain uncorrected, they are like one embracing a stone and plunging into the endless river.\n\nIn Wu, Yue, Liang, and Yi, the climate and character are pure and steadfast, hence many immortals arise. Thus, within the borders of Chengdu, the lands of Danyang, and the southeast of Kuaiji, where the celestial paths converge, it is most fitting to cultivate and uphold the Dao.\n\nOf these countless immortals and those who have transcended fate to receive the sacred texts, the multitude is too vast to record in full. Even among the lesser peaks, only a few are mentioned here.\n\nMaster Guigu is the Supreme Mystery’s Teacher, governing Mount Qingcheng. Prince Wang Qiao is the Attendant-in-Ordinary of the Golden Portal, governing Mount Tong□. Red Pine is the Immortal Earl of Kunlin, governing the Southern Peak. Prince Wang Deng is the Lesser Heavenly King, governing Mount Wangwu. Guzhu, Boyi, and Shuqi together serve as the Nine Heavens’ Chief Administrators, governing Mount Tiantai. Confucius is the Supreme Ultimate’s Perfected Duke, governing Mount Jiuyi. Yan Hui received the sacred texts and first became Attendant Gentleman of Bright Spring, later ascending as Controller of the Three Heavens’ Perfected. Seventy-two disciples received their names on the Mystic Continent; with three thousand followers, they need not pass through the gates of Northern Fengdu.\n\nXiang Yishan is the Marshal of Penglai. The Duke of Zhou is the Northern Emperor’s Teacher, governing Mount Jingge. Zhuang Zhou is the Supreme Mystery’s Academician, governing Mount Jing. Sun Quan received his commission and also governs Mount Jing. Zhang Daoling is the Three Heavens’ Dharma Master, overseeing the Six Voids, often attending the Golden Portal as the Supreme’s right hand, governing Mount Lu with three masters sharing the same abode.\n\nWang Fangping now serves as Grand Minister, governing Wushan in the land of the Yuezhi. Mo Di is the Supreme Ultimate’s Immortal Minister, governing Mount Maji. Xu Laile is the Supreme Ultimate’s Perfected, governing Mount Kuocang, with a lesser palace on Mount Tiantai. Chen Anshi governs Lesser Terrace Mountain. Yan Junping now governs Mount Emei. Qu Yuan is the Sea Earl, commanding the eight seas. Wang Bi is the Overseer of the Northern Sea. Guo Shengzi is the Perfected of Langfeng. Lady Wei governs the Southern Peak. Pei Qingling governs Mount Siming. Ma Mingsheng now resides on Mount Zhong. Yin Changsheng is the Perfected of Earth’s Lung. Sun Deng is the Perfected of Wenqiu. The Nine Flowers Perfected Consort governs Mount Xiagai or sometimes Mount Long. Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng, having received the texts, serve as the Orthodox Unity’s Three Heavens’ Protectors of Mount Lu.\n\nHan Zhong now is the Perfected of Huolin. Yu Ji of Langye is the Left Attendant Clerk of the Great Void. The Three Mao brothers serve as the Controllers of Life Protection and Record Stabilization, governing the northern residence of the Huayang Grotto-Heaven. Their retreats on Mount Bao number in the thousands, with lesser peaks no fewer than a hundred—all divine mountains.\n\nHere, I have briefly attested to the number of immortals, enough to strengthen your heart’s admiration. Guard this secret and do not disclose it. If a noble-minded scholar’s aspirations extend beyond the mountains, at the hour of your passing, seal this and show it to them. But those whose conduct remains unaccomplished and whose virtue lacks benevolence shall never be permitted to see it.\n\nWithin the embrace of green ridges and the spaces between a thousand peaks, immortals are boundless, standing shoulder to shoulder with mortals yet unknown to them. Some mortals, by karmic affinity, wander lost in the mountains and enter the service of immortal households, detained by the Jade Maidens of the immortal caves, their prior merits being profound.\n\nThose newly learning the Dao need not enter the mountains; closing the door and practicing diligently, avoiding worldly distractions, maintaining long fasts and steadfast will, or simply offering pure incense and sweeping clean, can also summon the Perfected. Lady Wei, the Xu family, and their like all belong to this tradition. One must first gather and study the true books of the esoteric arts for a long time; only when signs and responses roughly align should one withdraw from the world. If one must move among mortals or temporarily leave the mountains, matters of clothing and food need not involve worldly entanglements—there will be differences.\n\nOutwardly blending with the dust while inwardly guarding the True Unity—such is the subtlety of these words.\n\n*Record of the Primordial Supreme’s Perfected Immortals* concludes.",

She also bore the Nine Radiance Mystic Maiden, known as the Supreme Perfected Western Queen Mother, the Lady of the Western Han. The Heavenly Sovereigns, thirteen in number, later begot the Earthly Sovereigns, eleven in number, who in turn begot the Human Sovereigns, nine in number. Each ruled for thirty-six thousand years. The Perfected Sages emerged and received the Dao of the celestial patterns. They established the primordial state of non-action, completing the work of Heaven. The celestial texts of the Three Sovereigns transmitted to this day originate from their proclamations. Thus, they could summon the Great Sages of Heaven and the spirits of the Earth, commanding all without exception. Hence, the Heavenly Perfected Humans and the Three Heavenly Perfected Kings ride chariots drawn by nine dragons.*\n\n*Thereafter came the Eight Emperors—Da Ting, Fu Xi, Shen Nong, Zhu Rong, the Five Dragon Clan, and others—who were their descendants and now govern the Five Peaks. Thus, the Dao flourished in the earliest ages, but by the time of the Three Kings, its virtue had declined. The Three Kings were Yu of Xia, Tang of Yin, and Wu of Zhou. As pure customs gave way to decadence, change arose and ritual emerged—yet ritual was the harbinger of chaos. By the end of the Zhou, Yang weakened and Yin grew strong; the land teemed with widows. The western Rong rose with their bronze weapons, and heterodox teachings spread. Soon, the Nine Provinces were submerged, and the imperial enterprise lay in ruins—this prophecy has since been fulfilled. In the age when the Dao flourished, people were simple and uncarved; in the age when heterodox teachings prevailed, the people grew cunning and deceitful.\"*\n\nHong said: *\"These matters are profound and remote, beyond the grasp of ordinary learning. Though I am but a mediocre talent, I have been fortunate to catch the gaze of a Supreme Sage, to discourse upon the hidden mysteries of Heaven and Earth, and to expound the ultimate origins of the most wondrous truths. I shall record your teachings in order, inscribing them upon silk, to preserve them as an eternal treasure. Yet those without the capacity for impartial understanding must never be told of this Primordial Beginning. Thus, I leave these traces to be revealed only to the worthy of the world.\"*",

      "translated_text": "*The True Record* states:\n\nThe Mysterious Capital’s Jeweled Capital Mountain of Seven Treasures spans ninety thousand *li* in circumference and stands above the Great Veil Heaven. Its walls enclose palaces of seven treasures, and within these palaces rise terraces of seven treasures. There are three courts—upper, middle, and lower—forming a single palace-city, each side pierced by two hundred and forty gates. On all four sides grow eight rows of jeweled forests, their leaves verdant and fruits crimson, with five-colored mushroom blossoms. Above them flourish twelve thousand kinds of sacred fungi, while in the pools lotus flowers span ten *zhang* in diameter.\n\nThe Upper Court is governed by Pangu the Perfected, the Primordial Heavenly King, and the Supreme Mysterious Mother; the Middle Court by the Supreme Perfected, the Golden Portal Venerable Lord; and the Lower Court by the Nine Heavens’ Perfected August One and the Three Heavens’ Perfected Kings. The Jeweled Capital contains eight hundred and ten thousand celestial paths, connecting to eight hundred and ten thousand mountain grottoes and chambers. Those great sages who attain the Dao are all granted palaces and residences of seven treasures—some upon the Five Peaks, others within renowned mountains. Wherever sacred herbs grow, there are eight hundred and ten thousand such abodes. As the ancients said, \"Nine nines are eighty-one,\" marking the ultimate celestial path of the Jeweled Capital Mountain.\n\nThose immortals who receive heavenly appointments make thrice-daily audiences at the Mysterious Capital before the Supreme Perfected. Though the distance may span countless *li*, their coming and going are as a single step—how could the worldly ever comprehend this? Some immortals pay thrice-daily homage to the Lord of Fusang, others to the Queen Mother of the West.\n\nThe Golden Portal of the Jeweled Capital is where the Supreme Perfected thrice monthly attend the Primordial Heavenly King. The disciples of the Primordial One are like ministers to an emperor—some serve as Grand Masters, others as Chancellors. The Venerable Lord of the Golden Portal is a disciple of the Supreme One.\n\nThe Great Emperor of Fusang embodies the yang *qi* of the Primordial One and governs the East. Thus, the sons of worldly emperors correspond to the Eastern Palace. The Nine Radiant Lady of the Western Han embodies the primordial yin *qi* and governs the West. Hence, they are called the Lord of Wood and the Mother of Metal—the revered deities of Heaven and Earth. From the refining of primordial *qi* and essence, all things are born; through their harmonizing of yin and yang, the sun and moon shine. None exists apart from them. Their spirit endures eternally, their mandate knows no end. Embracing the One without deviation, they achieve everlastingness.\n\nWhen Heaven loses the balance of yin and yang, floods and droughts become unregulated; when humans lose this balance, their spiritual root and life-force wither. The people of this world cannot preserve the One or uphold the Three, turning life into death—this is only fitting. How can they complain afterward?\n\nWithin the next thousand years, I shall summon you to ascend to the Golden Portal of the Supreme One and feast in the Jeweled Capital. This fleeting moment is but a brief instant—now you may wander the Five Peaks, gather sacred fungi, seek the company of hidden immortals, and roam in effortless freedom. Can my words not be trusted as a promise?\n\nThe Great Emperor of Fusang dwells in the midst of the Azure Sea, his domain spanning thirty thousand *li* on each side. Above stands the Palace of the Supreme Perfected, its walls of azure jade stretching ten thousand *li*. Many forests grow there, their leaves resembling mulberry. There are also *zhen* trees, thousands of *zhang* tall and twenty *wei* in girth, growing in pairs from shared roots, leaning upon one another—hence the name Fusang. Its palaces mirror those of the Jeweled Capital. Countless immortals reside there, and those of the Mysterious Continent and Square Zhang who have not yet ascended to Heaven dwell here as well. It lies sixty thousand *li* from the shores of Kuaiji, governed by the Supreme Clarity’s Immortal Elder, the Supreme Venerable One.\n\nMount Penglai faces the northeastern shore of the Eastern Great Sea. The mountain spans five thousand *li* in circumference, its waves surging into the heavens. It is governed by the Nine *Qi* Venerable One.\n\nThe Mysterious Garden of Kunlun is encircled by a golden embankment-city, a thousand *li* on each side. Upon its walls stand five golden terraces and twelve jade towers, with palaces of luminous jasper, purple-green chambers, and seven-jeweled halls piled high with gold and jade, reaching the heavens. Ten-thousand-*xun* beasts roam there, and incense of a thousand myriad kinds fills the air. It is governed by the Nine Radiant Queen Mother of the West, and countless immortals dwell there.\n\nThe Venerable One of Broad Achievement is now the Perfected of Bell Mountain, the Nine Heavens’ Immortal King. The Four White-Haired Immortals of the Han, Anqi, and Pengzu now assist him there. Wuchengzi and Limozi are the Perfected of Min Mountain. Now, Xuanzhi and Yuzhi serve as its marquises.\n\nFuxi is the Green Emperor, governing Mount Tai; Zhuanxu is the Black Emperor, governing Mount Taiheng; Zhurong is the Red Emperor, governing Mount Heng and Huo; Xuanyuan is the Yellow Emperor, governing Mount Song; and Jintian is the White Emperor, governing Mount Huayin. These five are the Five Emperors.\n\nYao governed Mount Xiong’er; Shun governed Mount Jishi; Yu governed Mount Gaizhu; Tang governed Mount Xuanji; and Qingwu governed Mount Chang and Mount Fengxiu. These five served as the Five Emperors’ ministers and assistants, overseeing their affairs. Every kalpa, the assistants of the Five Emperors are replaced.\n\nXu You and Chao Fu are now the Nine Heavens’ Chamberlains, lords of Mount Ji. Xia Qi and Zhou Fa received the scriptures and became the Four Poles’ Illustrious Lords. Some dwell in Fengdu, others in grotto-heavens.\n\nThe three Zhous’ greatest is the Perfected of Jiangling, and both reside on Mount Jinhua. Emperor Gaozu of Han and Emperor Guangwu are now the Four Illuminations’ honored guests. King Ling of Zhou is now the Supreme Void’s Attendant Gentleman, governing Mount Bolong.\n\nYue Zichang’s entire family attained immortality but have not yet received heavenly appointments, dwelling together in the chambers of Square Zhang. They received the Register of Supreme Mystery on the Divine Continent and subsist on the five sacred fungi.\n\nGuo Jingchun is now the Director of Destinies, governing the Terrace of Emptiness. Zuo Yuanfang is now the Perfected of Heaven’s Pillar, overseeing the Immortal Marquises. Ge Xuan received the Golden Portal Lord’s mandate and became the Supreme Ultimate’s Left Immortal Duke, governing Mount Gaizhu and residing on Mount Nüji, often riding tigers.\n\nXu Ying began as the Immortal of Huolin. Xu Mu established his dwelling in the Huayang Grotto-Heaven and became a Perfected. Xu Yufu resides north of Tongchu, holding the rank of Perfected but without a governing post. Bao Jing is the Master of the Underworld, bearing the title Perfected of Hidden Mountain. After five hundred years, he shall become the Attendant Gentleman of Kunbing.",

Zhao Wenhe and Perfected Wang are the Ghost Emperors of the West, governing Mount Boyi.\n\nEarthbound immortals roam the Five Peaks, paying morning court to the Queen Mother of the West and resting at dusk upon the slopes of Mount Zhong. Though they have not ascended to Heaven, their joy is beyond words. Even in the courts of Tongchu and the palaces of Yiqian, such bliss alone prevails. Within these sacred mountains, immortals depart year after year, yet mortals neither see nor believe—how lamentable!\n\nThose who study the Dao without regard for body or life, whose hearts and wills remain pure and unsullied—I have never seen them return empty-handed. Yet some practice without diligence, or diligent but unable to cast aside the pleasures of greed; if the three karmic actions and ten evils remain uncorrected, they are like one embracing a stone and plunging into the endless river.\n\nIn Wu, Yue, Liang, and Yi, the climate and character are pure and steadfast, hence many immortals arise. Thus, within the borders of Chengdu, the lands of Danyang, and the southeast of Kuaiji, where the celestial paths converge, it is most fitting to cultivate and uphold the Dao.\n\nOf these countless immortals and those who have transcended fate to receive the sacred texts, the multitude is too vast to record in full. Even among the lesser peaks, only a few are mentioned here.\n\nMaster Guigu is the Supreme Mystery’s Teacher, governing Mount Qingcheng. Prince Wang Qiao is the Attendant-in-Ordinary of the Golden Portal, governing Mount Tong□. Red Pine is the Immortal Earl of Kunlin, governing the Southern Peak. Prince Wang Deng is the Lesser Heavenly King, governing Mount Wangwu. Guzhu, Boyi, and Shuqi together serve as the Nine Heavens’ Chief Administrators, governing Mount Tiantai. Confucius is the Supreme Ultimate’s Perfected Duke, governing Mount Jiuyi. Yan Hui received the sacred texts and first became Attendant Gentleman of Bright Spring, later ascending as Controller of the Three Heavens’ Perfected. Seventy-two disciples received their names on the Mystic Continent; with three thousand followers, they need not pass through the gates of Northern Fengdu.\n\nXiang Yishan is the Marshal of Penglai. The Duke of Zhou is the Northern Emperor’s Teacher, governing Mount Jingge. Zhuang Zhou is the Supreme Mystery’s Academician, governing Mount Jing. Sun Quan received his commission and also governs Mount Jing. Zhang Daoling is the Three Heavens’ Dharma Master, overseeing the Six Voids, often attending the Golden Portal as the Supreme’s right hand, governing Mount Lu with three masters sharing the same abode.\n\nWang Fangping now serves as Grand Minister, governing Wushan in the land of the Yuezhi. Mo Di is the Supreme Ultimate’s Immortal Minister, governing Mount Maji. Xu Laile is the Supreme Ultimate’s Perfected, governing Mount Kuocang, with a lesser palace on Mount Tiantai. Chen Anshi governs Lesser Terrace Mountain. Yan Junping now governs Mount Emei. Qu Yuan is the Sea Earl, commanding the eight seas. Wang Bi is the Overseer of the Northern Sea. Guo Shengzi is the Perfected of Langfeng. Lady Wei governs the Southern Peak. Pei Qingling governs Mount Siming. Ma Mingsheng now resides on Mount Zhong. Yin Changsheng is the Perfected of Earth’s Lung. Sun Deng is the Perfected of Wenqiu. The Nine Flowers Perfected Consort governs Mount Xiagai or sometimes Mount Long. Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng, having received the texts, serve as the Orthodox Unity’s Three Heavens’ Protectors of Mount Lu.\n\nHan Zhong now is the Perfected of Huolin. Yu Ji of Langye is the Left Attendant Clerk of the Great Void. The Three Mao brothers serve as the Controllers of Life Protection and Record Stabilization, governing the northern residence of the Huayang Grotto-Heaven. Their retreats on Mount Bao number in the thousands, with lesser peaks no fewer than a hundred—all divine mountains.\n\nHere, I have briefly attested to the number of immortals, enough to strengthen your heart’s admiration. Guard this secret and do not disclose it. If a noble-minded scholar’s aspirations extend beyond the mountains, at the hour of your passing, seal this and show it to them. But those whose conduct remains unaccomplished and whose virtue lacks benevolence shall never be permitted to see it.\n\nWithin the embrace of green ridges and the spaces between a thousand peaks, immortals are boundless, standing shoulder to shoulder with mortals yet unknown to them. Some mortals, by karmic affinity, wander lost in the mountains and enter the service of immortal households, detained by the Jade Maidens of the immortal caves, their prior merits being profound.\n\nThose newly learning the Dao need not enter the mountains; closing the door and practicing diligently, avoiding worldly distractions, maintaining long fasts and steadfast will, or simply offering pure incense and sweeping clean, can also summon the Perfected. Lady Wei, the Xu family, and their like all belong to this tradition. One must first gather and study the true books of the esoteric arts for a long time; only when signs and responses roughly align should one withdraw from the world. If one must move among mortals or temporarily leave the mountains, matters of clothing and food need not involve worldly entanglements—there will be differences.\n\nOutwardly blending with the dust while inwardly guarding the True Unity—such is the subtlety of these words.\n\n*Record of the Primordial Supreme’s Perfected Immortals* concludes.",
