  "full_translation": "**Records of the Strange**\n\n**Title:** *Records of the Strange*. Compiled by Du Guangting of the late Tang and Five Dynasties period. Eight fascicles. Based on the text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, category of hagiographies in the *Dongxuan* section.\n\nThough the sage does not speak of the uncanny, the mighty, chaos, or spirits, the classics, scriptures, and historical records often contain such accounts. Earlier works like *Accounts of the Strange*, *Records of Broad Learning*, and *Collections of Marvels* belong to this tradition. As for the charts and apocrypha of the Six Classics, the books of the Yellow River and Luo River, they separately record matters of yin and yang, divine transformations, omens of fortune and misfortune—all arising with the two *qi* and manifesting through the Five Phases. Whether auspicious stars and sweet dew, joined jades and linked pearls, fine wheat and rare grain, precious birds and rare beasts, divine mushrooms and spirit elixirs, propitious clouds and sweet springs, or transformations between strange creatures and humans, all emerge when their destined number arrives, inevitably coming into being. When their number is exhausted, they inevitably vanish. Just as field mice become quails, pheasants become mirages, sparrows turn into clams, and hawks into turtledoves; as stellar essences descend to become worthy ministers and mountain spirits ascend to become loyal aides—what this record contains is but a fraction of such abundance. Moreover, like the spirit of the stone at Shenshi in Jin, possessing people to bargain for objects, or the blood of crows and the size of fish becoming disasters and portents—though these startle the ear at first, upon verification, they prove tied to the cycles of destiny. Within the vast realm, no day passes without such occurrences. In moments of leisure, I have casually gathered and recorded them, sometimes verifying through what I have seen and heard, sometimes drawing from regional records. May those fond of such matters find no lack in perusing these accounts. Thus, I name it *Records of the Strange*. Your servant Guangting respectfully prefaces.\n\n---\n\n**Fascicle One**\n\nCompiled by the Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, the Broadly Accomplished Master, and Duke of Cai, your servant, Master Du.\n\n### **Immortals**\n\n**Master Ghost Valley** was an ancient perfected immortal. His surname was Wang, and he lived from the time of the Yellow Emperor through the Shang and Zhou dynasties. He followed Lord Lao west to transform the Flowing Sands, and by the end of the Zhou, he returned to the Central Kingdom. Dwelling in Ghost Valley Mountain by the Han River, he transmitted the Dao to over a hundred disciples, though only Zhang Yi and Su Qin, who did not aspire to immortality, favored the arts of horizontal and vertical alliances. At that time, the royal net had collapsed, and the feudal lords warred against one another, oppressing the weak and bullying the few, their weapons stirring like clouds. The two disciples, having gained power, unleashed their tongues amid the Warring States, now meeting success, now failure, now adversity, now prosperity. They vied in cunning and eloquence, contending for fame and coveting rank, no longer holding the lofty aspirations of the cloudy forests.\n\nThe Master sent a letter to Yi and Qin, saying: \"Gentlemen, your achievements and fame are resplendent, yet spring arrives, and autumn does not linger. The flourishing sun is about to set; the times are growing old. Have you not seen the trees by the river? Chariots and horses break their branches, waves and currents erode their roots. These trees bear no enmity toward the world—it is simply where they dwell. Have you not seen the pines and cedars of Mount Song and Mount Tai, the blossoming trees of Mount Hua? Their upper leaves touch the azure clouds, their roots reach the three springs. Above dwell dark foxes and black apes; below lurk leopards and hidden dragons. For a thousand autumns and ten thousand years, they never encounter the calamity of axes. These trees share no kinship with the world—it is simply where they dwell. Now, you two favor the glory of cloudy paths and admire enduring merit, scorning the eternal longevity of towering pines and venerating the fleeting titles of a single night. How lamentable! How lamentable, gentlemen!\"\n\nYi and Qin replied: \"Master, you embody virtue and embrace the vast, hunger satisfied by divine mushrooms, thirst quenched by jade nectar. Your power shines as brightly as the gods, equal to the Three Luminaries. You have not forgotten to send us a letter, warning against greed and delusion. Though I, Yi, am dull-witted and my fame obscure, I entered Qin to aid its hegemony, hoping to assist the lord of the age. Your analogy of the riverbank and the mountains, though I have long been empty of substance, truly resonates with this intent. We say: How magnificent! Master, your dark vision and distant insight make the rise and fall of things as clear as day.\"\n\nThe two gentlemen could not suppress their ambitions nor withdraw from the world, content with the pleasures of insects in dreams or nests in reeds and bamboo—self-destructing to the point of annihilation. How lamentable! How grievous!\n\n**The Messenger of the Nine Heavens of Mount Lu**\nDuring the Kaiyuan era, the Emperor dreamed of divine immortals and their feathered retinue—thousands of chariots, tens of thousands of riders—gathering in the sky. One figure, clad in crimson robes and a golden crown, descended in a carriage. He addressed the Emperor, saying: *\"I am the Nine Heavens’ Inspector, patrolling and investigating the mortal realm. I wish to establish a lower palace on the northwest of Mount Lu. The foundation of timber and stone already exists; only labor is required.\"* The Emperor dispatched an emissary to the northwest of the mountain, where the traces of a foundation indeed lay evident. Overnight, thousands of massive logs arrived of their own accord, untouched by human hands. Halls, pavilions, and galleries were constructed according to their destined forms, all materials perfectly sufficient.\n\nSome say these logs were once gathered by the King of Jiujiang to build a palace, later sunk in the depths of Mipu in Jiangzhou. Now, divine beings had transported them for this purpose. To the west of the temple stretched a long corridor, its pillars and bases suspended over a vast ravine. Below, torrents roared, their depths unfathomable. Yet through the years, it never once faltered or sank. When the temple was first built, the timber arrived spontaneously—tens of thousands of logs in a single night, all bearing water marks. The foundations of gates, halls, and corridors emerged naturally, untouched by human tools or rammed earth. Five-colored divine radiance illuminated the temple grounds, as bright as daylight. Axes swung and labor progressed without pause, yet the workers never wearied. Within a month, the work was complete.\n\nAs construction finished, the imperial emissary dreamed of a divine being who said: *\"Vermilion, ochre, cinnabar, and green pigments lie buried in the earth to the north of the temple—seek and you shall find them. No need to search afar.\"* They investigated and indeed obtained all they required, lacking nothing. Later, at the ferry of Jianchang, over five hundred divine officials—dressed in the robes of Daoist priests—appeared, declaring they were en route to the Messenger’s temple. Their images remain preserved there.\n\nEarlier, when Emperor Xuanzong dreamed of the divine being, he summoned the alchemist of Mount Tiantai, Sima Chengzhen, to inquire about the matter. Chengzhen memorialized: *\"The renowned mountains, great peaks, and sacred rivers are served by spirits who receive blood sacrifices. The Supreme Lord, fearing they might recklessly wield power to harm the common people, dispatched perfected immortals to oversee the mountains and rivers. There are the Five Marchmount True Lords, with the Elder of Qingcheng as their chief. The Nine Heavens Controller of Life on Mount Song governs the registers of mortal lives, while the Nine Heavens Messenger of Mount Lu holds the records of the Three Heavens. They investigate and discipline the myriad spirits, all under the authority of the Five Marchmounts. Each has temples established where offerings of vegetarian feasts are presented.\"* That year, temples were erected for the Five Marchmounts and the Three Sacred Mountains.\n\nAt the Yellow Crane Tower in Ezhou, before the river, stands a stele of Perfected Luo. It records that Perfected Luo once appeared in Ezhou, his hair bound in twin topknots, his age around forty. He worked as a laborer in a commoner’s household, never speaking. One day, during a grand gathering in the prefecture, he suddenly rebuked a man in the crowd, ordering him to leave at once. The man, terrified, bowed in apology and fled into the river beneath the tower. The onlookers were all astonished.\n\nThe prefect inquired into the matter, and the man replied: \"The one I rebuked was the White Dragon of the river. It intended to bring disaster upon this city, so I drove it away.\" The prefect, doubting his words, requested to witness the White Dragon himself to verify the truth. The man then accompanied the prefect to the tower, where he cast a talisman into the river. Suddenly, the waters darkened, and the White Dragon appeared—hundreds of *zhang* in length—visible to all. Soon after, it was sent away again. This man was none other than Perfected Luo. Nowadays, Perfected Luo Gongyuan often appears in Shu, frequently presiding over matters of flood and drought. The one seen in Ezhou may well have been Gongyuan.\n\nKing An of Huainan was fond of the Dao of immortals and transcendence. Many masters of esoteric arts from across the land gathered in his court. One day, the Eight Lords arrived, their appearances withered and frail, their bodies bent with age. The gatekeeper said to them: \"The King seeks those who pursue the Dao of immortality, transcendence, and longevity—those who must possess extraordinary abilities. He extends his courtesy only to such individuals. Now, your aged and feeble state is not what the King should see.\" Though rebuffed several times, the Eight Lords persisted in seeking an audience, and the gatekeeper repeated his refusal. The Eight Lords said: \"The King finds us too old and does not wish to meet us. Yet if we were to appear youthful, would that be difficult?\" With that, they straightened their robes, composed their bearing, and instantly transformed into the likeness of young boys. Startled, the gatekeeper led them inside. The King rushed to greet them, sandals reversed in his haste, and with reverent courtesy addressed them as disciples: \"Noble immortals, you have descended from afar—how may I be instructed?\" When asked their names, they replied: \"We are known as Wen the Five Constants, Wu the Seven Virtues, Zhi the Hundred Blossoms, Shou the Thousand Years, Ye the Ten Thousand Roots, Ming the Nine Marshes, Xiu the Three Fields, and Cen the One Peak.\" Each possessed the power to summon wind and rain, shake thunder and lightning, overturn heaven and earth, reverse the sun’s course and halt the rivers’ flow, command ghosts and spirits, lash demons and specters, traverse fire and water, shift mountains and rivers, and perform transformations beyond measure.\n\nAt that time, the King’s minor official, Wu Bei, had committed an offense and feared execution. Anxious and unsettled, he went to the imperial court to report a rebellion, accusing King An of treason. Emperor Wu grew suspicious and dispatched the Grand Master of Ceremonies with an imperial edict to Huainan to investigate. Before the Grand Master arrived, the Eight Lords said to the King: \"Wu Bei, though a subject, has falsely accused his lord—heaven will surely punish him. You must depart now. This is also heaven’s decree for you. Without this matter, day after day would pass, and how could you ever leave the mortal world?\"\n\nThen they took a cauldron to boil the elixir, had the King ingest it, and along with nearly three hundred of his kin and close attendants, they ascended to heaven on the same day. Even the chickens and dogs that had licked the vessels containing the elixir likewise flew away with them. The Eight Lords and the King paused their horses upon a mountain boulder, leaving only the tracks of men and steeds behind—no one knew where they had gone.\n\nWhen the Grand Master of Ceremonies arrived and reported these events to the Emperor, the Emperor was filled with deep regret and ordered the execution of Wu Bei. From then on, he broadly summoned masters of esoteric arts, seeking the elixir of transcendence, but never obtained it. Later, when the Queen Mother of the West descended, she bestowed upon him the *Scriptures of Immortality* and secretly granted him the *Numinous Formulae*, through which he attained the Dao of *corpse liberation*. Thus, the *Mao Ling*, *Jade Casket*, and *Golden Staff* texts reemerged among men, and the *Scripture of the Ox-Holding Path* was discovered in mountain caverns—these were also signs left for Emperor Wu of his own immortality.\n\nLi Yuanxing, a Daoist of the Zhi Zhen Abbey in Chengdu, during the Longshuo era, wished to construct an abbey on the Learning Archery Mountain. One night, he dreamed of a divine being leading him up a high mountain into a grand hall, where he paid homage to the Central Yellow Lord Lao. The Lord stood several *zhang* tall, with a snowy white beard and whiskers, wearing a golden phoenix crown and a robe of cloud and mist, attended by over ten retainers. Turning to Yuanxing, he said: \"I have timber nearby that may be used to build this abbey—do not trouble yourself.\" For several nights in succession, he dreamed the same. Then, a man fishing from a boat in the Ten-Thousand-Years Pond noticed the water was exceptionally clear and saw many large logs at the bottom. He informed Yuanxing, who sent men to retrieve them. They obtained over a thousand pieces of black poplar, some reaching a hundred *chi* in length, which were used to construct the abbey. They built a hall for the Yellow Lord Lao, sculpting his image as seen in the dream. They also constructed a Three Sages Hall, lecture halls, fasting altars, chambers, corridors, and gates—all the timber was sufficient for the task.\n\nIn the fourth year of the Yongping era, the *jiayin* year, Wang Chengshang, the Prefect of Lizhou, memorialized that twenty *li* west of Shendu Pass, within the depths of the mountains, lay the Yang Mo Cavern of the Long Dao Mountain. Perched amid sheer cliffs, it was a place no mortal could reach. Within the cavern, immortals had long dwelled—sometimes three, sometimes five—dressed in yellow and purple, often appearing to those below. At that time, the number of those seen had grown. The Emperor issued an edict dispatching the Master of Daoist Rites, the Venerable Master of Concentrated Truth, and the Silent Mirror Scholar Ren Keyan, along with the Inner Great Virtue Shi Zhaoxun, to present imperial incense and *blue-green memorials* and accompany the eunuch Yang Zhishu to perform rites of thanksgiving. The immortals reappeared as before. The Emperor then renamed Jinggu County as Jinxian County, Long Dao Mountain as Xuandu Mountain, and Yang Mo Cavern as Zixia Cavern. He further enfeoffed the master of Xuandu Mountain as the Duke of Jade Clarity, established the Zixia Abbey to commemorate the event, and granted the county magistrate Li Yue the *flying-fish* insignia and a formal appointment.\n\nBy the great river of Enzhou, where cliffs rose ten thousand *ren* high, a cavern opened in the sheer rock face, within which immortals dwelled. Boatmen on the river would call out to them, and they would often emerge, clad in purple robes, gazing down at the riverbank for a long while before departing. Beneath the cavern, the river shoals were shallow, and passing boats would unload their cargo there to lighten their vessels before proceeding. Liu Zaihong of Xuchuan once passed this shoal. The boatmen recounted the tale, and he called out several times—sure enough, the immortals appeared.\n\nAtop the mountain’s highest peak stood many stone pillars, towering and solitary, some nearly a thousand *chi* tall, others several hundred, all gleaming with a pure, white luster like congealed cream or piled snow, untouched by human footsteps. Among the mountains of Qian and Xia, the Greater and Lesser You were both secluded and sublime realms, the abodes of immortals.\n\nSu, a scholar-official, was fond of wine and would sing the *Wang Jiangnan*. Skilled in crafting polo mallets, he mingled with the common folk while secretly cultivating the Dao. Whenever he lacked something, he would use his polo mallet to barter with others, exchanging the gold he received for wine. One day, in broad daylight within the prefecture, he ascended to heaven—this occurred around the *renshen* and *guiyou* years. Zhang Wenhuan, the magistrate of Fenxi in Jinzhou, recounted this tale.\n\nWhen the immortal Lord Xu was still in the world, he once oversaw the renovation of an abbey. Upon its completion, he wished to inscribe a stele to record the event. He found an ancient stele, but its characters were worn and unrecognizable. He had the old inscription carved away to engrave a new record, but from then on, he felt restless and uneasy. One leisurely day, as he strolled through the courtyard, he heard a voice from the void say: \"Lord Xu, Lord Xu, hasten to the Water Bureau to seek salvation, or you will face unforeseen calamity.\" Startled, he asked again, but no answer came. He then burned incense at the hearth and prayed earnestly, wishing to know the reason for seeking salvation. After a long while, the voice spoke again: \"Though the old inscription on the stele you carved has been erased, the one who composed it has lodged a complaint with the Water Bureau, accusing you of usurping his name to make yours known. Thus, the Water Bureau will soon issue a summons for confrontation—you must seek their aid swiftly.\" Lord Xu then sought out the original inscription and had it re-engraved on the stele. That night, he dreamed of a divine being thanking him, saying: \"Now that my name has been restored, I have no way to repay you. I ask that you hold a grand *Water and Land Rite*, proclaiming it to the myriad spirits of mountains and rivers. With the Three Bureaus’ endorsement, you may attain the *verification of the Dao*.\" Lord Xu followed the instructions and thus achieved the fruit of the Dao. From then on, the method of the *Water and Land Rite* was transmitted among men. The Daoist Yang Jingzhao of Chengdu recounted this tale.\n\nMa Daoliu, named Zhineng, often wandered among rivers and lakes. In the *dingsi* year of the Qianning era, he arrived at the Jade Beam Abbey. At the time, a grand fast was being held, and Zhineng ascended directly to the mountain’s summit. The Daoist community tried to detain him, but he pressed on. At the summit, in the place where the Nine Immortals had attained the Dao, he sat in perfect composure and transformed, his complexion unchanged, his limbs supple—no different from when he was alive.\n\nSima Ningzheng, who studied books and loved the Dao, had long wandered among rivers and lakes. In the early Xiantong era, he, along with the Daoists Bai Wuyu and Zhang Jianbai, transcribed the *True Scriptures* at the Cavern of Perfected Reality Abbey.\n\nHaving soon resumed his wanderings among the mountains, he appeared no older than fifty. During the Tianfu era, he traveled between the Western Mountains, Jade Bamboo, and Yuanji prefectures, where all recognized him. Yet his nature was rigid and coarse, never constrained by decorum. Often in markets, streets, and alleys, he would brawl with others.\n\nOne day at Shengmi Wharf in Hongzhou, he lodged in a monastic compound. For days he drank to intoxication and was struck by someone. The monks, troubled by this, reproached him upon his sobriety: \"Master, your conduct is unbridled and wild—you not only disgrace the Daoist way but also disrupt our peace.\"\n\nHearing this, Ningzheng grew furious: \"To be humiliated by monks—why live?\" He collapsed to the ground and died. Soon his flesh turned dark as indigo, his limbs stiff and taut. The authorities examined him, and the county reported the matter to the prefecture. Though it was the height of summer, his body lay unclaimed for days. When the verification was complete, there was no sign of decay. The prefectural office ordered garments and a burial shroud provided, and prepared to bathe and enshroud him.\n\nSuddenly, he sat bolt upright, shook out his robes, and stepped from the coffin, his countenance unaltered. He entered a tavern to drink as if nothing had occurred. The crowd marveled in astonishment, unable to fathom the cause.\n\nThis occurred within the borders of Jiangxi during the Tianyou gengwu year. The recluse Zhu Jun recorded in *The Illustrated Gazetteer of Lingchi County*: Zhu Taochui was a hermit. In the first year of the Wude reign, he dwelt in Baonümao Village of Shu County. Clad in hempen robes and a plain cap, he concealed his name and rank, weaving sandals for his livelihood, never haggling over price. Later, he resided on Mount Lianping at White Horse Creek, upon the Great Flat Rock. The stone, white as frost and smooth as whetstone, could seat ten. Beside it stood a tree whose branches cast cooling shade, so that even in the scorching heat of summer, the place felt like autumn. Taochui rested and reclined there. Many lovers of antiquity often visited the site. Zhu would sometimes split cartwheels for sustenance. Former Prefect Li Houde and later Prefect Gao Shilian sent him bows and banners, or letters, but he only smiled in disdain and never replied. The Grand Guardian of the Crown Prince, Xue Ji of Hedong, composed a eulogy and portrait for him:\n\n*\"The Master knows contentment,\ndwelling apart in leisure.\nNever haggling over price,\neating but once a day.\nHis hut is of tamped earth,\nhis cap of rolled leaves.\nThe art of splitting wheels—\njoy shared with Bian [Que] alike.\"*\n\nThe *Ode to the Thatched Hut of the Recluse Zhu Taochui* by Xue Ji:\n\n*\"As for those who embrace emptiness,\nworldly affairs bring no glory.\nThe hidden and wandering kind\nfind joy in quiet seclusion.\"*\n\nThus, even Confucius, that paragon of understanding, endured the mockery of Jie Ni; and Ji Kang, that lofty man, suffered the reproach of Sun Deng. How much more so for one who roams mountains and rivers, scattering his will to delight the spirit—inquiring beyond the thatched hut’s eaves, his thoughts fixed beyond the azure clouds, freeing his worldly cares, and fulfilling his noble aspirations in an enlightened age.\n\nIts preface reads: Behold my humble abode, refined yet rustic in the wilds, standing alone beside the mountain, its lofty bearing unmatched. Steep cliffs, though crumbling, channel the wind; hanging crags, though collapsing, pour forth the sunlight. At times of leisure, as evening thoughts turn to the beauty of the scene, the verdant spring stirs this valley, and my heart and spirit are entrusted to it. I carve wild blossoms into a staff, roll bamboo leaves into a headband. I do not prize fame, nor treasure pearls and jade. Naturally, I draw out a whistle in the wind, or sleep soundly beneath the moon. My courtyard holds but three paths; my zither, but one string. I wander idly by the pond, roam freely among the cliffs and ravines—carefree, with no attachment, my will and intent ever self-content. Facing the bright moon, I pluck the zither; before the clear breeze, I sip my wine. Gazing at the green pines upon the ridge, listening to the white cranes among the clouds, I delight in the mountains and waters, forgetting the loneliness of zither and books. In the valley, the cries of birds seem especially rich, their many voices and tones harmonizing of their own accord. I see the许毛’s feathered robes truly tangled like brocade; I hear their melodies, so like the cadence of strings—now slow, now swift—as they gather toward my thatched hut. At times, a pair of mandarin ducks arrives; often, wandering bees enter. When the ice melts, the green waters flow anew; when the grass grows, the steps before me are once more damp.\n\nMy intent is not to befriend the world; my intent is not to envy the establishment of merit and fame. I know that worldly affairs are all in vain—how much better to dwell in seclusion, ever restrained. Initially, when Magistrate Xue governed Pengshan, he heard of Zhu’s reputation and delighted in it, composing the *Rhapsody on the Thatched Hut* to present to him. Later, upon resigning his post and returning to the capital, Xue took a detour to pay a visit, only to find the hut already empty. Yet the traces remained vivid. Inquiring among the villagers, he learned that Master Zhu came and went, now hidden, now revealed—truly one who had attained the Dao. Magistrate Xue inscribed a eulogy upon the wall before returning to Chang’an. Several years later, villagers would occasionally see Master Zhu, though none knew his whereabouts in the end. The stone where he had secluded himself is no longer visible; beneath the great tree, only a stone grotto remains. In recent years, the entrance to the grotto has also closed. Later, an official fond of such matters had the rhapsody engraved on a stele and erected beside the grotto’s entrance, near the main road. Yet villagers who come to pray, burn incense, and make offerings find it often responds with efficacy. If not one who had attained the Dao and realized its fruits, who could achieve such a state?\n\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll One—concluded.\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll Two.\n\nDu Guangting, Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, President of the Board of Revenue in the Department of State Affairs, and Duke of Cai, compiles:\n\n**Extraordinary Figures**\n\n**Li Te**, styled Xuanxiu, was a descendant of the Lin Lords. In ancient times, the Wu Luo Zhongli Mountain collapsed, revealing two stone caves—one red as cinnabar, the other black as lacquer. From the red cave emerged a man named Wu Xiang, of the Ba clan. From the black cave emerged four clans: the Hao, Fan, Wu, and Zheng. All five clans contended for leadership. Wu Xiang proposed a trial: whoever could lodge a sword in the cave wall would become the Lin Lord. The four clans failed, but Wu Xiang’s sword hung firmly. Next, they fashioned boats of earth, carved and painted them, and set them afloat, declaring, \"Whoever’s boat floats shall be the Lin Lord.\" Only Wu Xiang’s boat remained buoyant. Thus, he was called Mo Lord. Boarding his earthen vessel with his followers, he descended along the Yi River until he reached Ziyan. The water deity of Guanyang, a woman, barred his way, saying, \"This land abounds in fish and salt; it is vast enough for us both. Stay, do not go further.\" Mo Lord replied, \"I must seek land for my people. I cannot stay.\"\n\nThe salt deity spent nights with Mo Lord but departed at dawn, transforming into a flying insect. All the spirits followed, darkening the sky. Mo Lord sought to kill her but could not. For ten days, he lost all sense of direction, unable to distinguish east from west. Finally, he gave the salt deity a blue thread, saying, \"Wear this. If it suits you, we shall live together. If not, I shall leave you.\" The deity took the thread and wore it. Mo Lord climbed onto a sunlit rock and, spotting the blue thread, knelt and shot her. The arrow struck true; the salt deity died, and the swarm of spirits dispersed. The sky cleared.\n\nMo Lord boarded his earthen boat once more and descended to Yicheng. The stone banks of Yicheng curved like a cave, as did the spring waters. Mo Lord sighed, \"I have but lately emerged from a cave, and now I enter another. What fate is this?\" The bank collapsed, forming a breach over three *zhang* wide, with steps leading upward. Mo Lord ascended and found a flat stone, five *chi* long and one *zhang* wide. He rested upon it, casting his divining stalks and tallying accounts—all adhered to the stone. He built a city beside it and dwelled there. His descendants multiplied, and when Qin unified the realm, the land became Qianzhong Commandery. In years of light taxation, the people paid forty thousand coins. The Ba people called tribute *bao* (\"treasure\"), and so they were called the *shi* (\"substantial\") people.\n\n**Yuan Qi**, a man of Xiangzhong during the Later Han, once fell into a drunken stupor in his village. After three days, he awoke, his breath reeking of wine. He claimed to have drunk with heavenly spirits. Later, as magistrate of Hanyang, his predictions of abundance or scarcity proved accurate. By day, he judged the living; by night, the dead. Suddenly, he ascended to heaven on a cloud, and none knew his whereabouts thereafter.\n\n**Master Qizhen Li Xifan** resided at the Xuan Yuan Abbey on Northern Yu Mountain. By the end of the Xiantong era, he had lived there for several years. Whenever he entered Luoyang through the Hui’an Gate, he would change his attire and rest his horse. There was a scholar named Li, of unknown origin, aged about fifty, who treated Master Li with the courtesy due an uncle. Li invited the master to his home, where a dozen pupils studied. He had a wife and a son, and though his household was poor, they barely managed each day. Thereafter, the master often visited and stayed at the school, growing unusually close to Li.\n\nOne evening, Li came to Yu Mountain to bid the master farewell. They sat by the hearth, talking late into the night. The master asked where he was bound. Li replied, \"This parting is my departure from the world, not a distant journey. I have been appointed by the underworld to oversee the daily water supply for a city’s households. My term ends this month; I cannot stay longer. In three days, I shall die, and in five, my wife and son will bury me beneath this mountain. What I lack is a thousand coins to hire mourners. I entrust this to you, my Daoist brother, and bid you farewell.\" He added, \"The people of the world use no more than three to five *sheng* of water daily. Exceeding this invites misfortune and karmic reckoning. Be vigilant.\" When asked about his family’s future, Li said, \"My wife will remarry a man named Wang. My son is destined for the monastic life, but his master resides in the south and will not arrive for two years. His name is Xingcheng. Until then, he may stay at the abbey.\"\n\nThe master asked, \"Could he not enter the Dao?\" Li replied, \"He is meant for the sangha, not the Dao. This is not a matter of human will but of predestined rank.\" At dawn, he departed. Thereafter, snow and cold delayed the master’s return to Luoyang for five days. When the skies cleared, Li’s wife and several companions visited the master, saying, \"Li has passed. He was buried beneath the mountain this morning. He owed a thousand coins, which he entrusted to you. We have come to collect it.\" She left her son at the abbey.\n\nLater, the monk Xingcheng from the south arrived and lodged in the master’s chamber. The master entrusted Li’s son to him. Xingcheng gladly took the boy, saying, \"Since there is a prior agreement, I shall teach him the Dharma and ordain him.\" Two years later, Xingcheng returned, and the boy had become a monk. He had mastered the *Lotus Sutra* with great precision. Earlier, the master had given him Daoist scriptures, but after a year, he could not memorize a single page. Truly, a person’s destiny is fixed—he was indeed meant for the sangha.\n\n**Li Ye** sat for the imperial examinations but failed. On his return, he encountered Shanhao Mountain. A sudden thunderstorm forced him to seek shelter in a village home. The nearest neighbors were far off, and the household had only a young boy tending the house.\n\nLi Ye tethered his donkey beneath the eaves. Left Army Officer Li and Acting Official Yang Zhen also sought shelter in the house. Li had a horse, and together they entered the dwelling. By the time the storm had somewhat cleared, it was already dusk. The young boy said, \"Uncle Ang dislikes guests. You should leave now.\" Li Ye replied, \"The nearest homes are far away, and the day is already late. It would be impossible to go on.\" Soon after, an old man returned. Seeing the guests, he was delighted and welcomed them with exceptional courtesy, urging them to stay the night. At dawn, he earnestly insisted on preparing a meal, but Li Ye repeatedly declined. He then said, \"My grandson said Uncle Ang dislikes guests, and I was also worried that traveling at night would be impossible. I am deeply troubled by this unexpected kindness—how can I repay such generosity?\" The old man replied, \"My family is poor and has little to offer guests. This is merely a temporary courtesy, not that I dislike company. However, all three of you are military commissioners—how could I not serve you properly?\" Li Ye said, \"Among the three of us, only one is an acting official. You exaggerate.\" The old man said, \"An acting official holds the iron tally of command, ranking above a cavalry commander. A scholar’s authority comes after a cavalry commander’s. Still, you hold five iron tallies—take care of yourself. After failing the examinations for so many years, you will later join the military.\" The following year, Yang Zhen was promoted by Chancellor Qiu Shiliang and rose through the ranks to become a military commander before being appointed as the Jiezhou Military Commissioner. Li and Zhen simultaneously became military commanders, with Li governing Dengzhou. For his merits in suppressing the Dangxiang, Li Ye was appointed to Zhenwu and then Jingzhou, eventually holding five military governorships—his iron tallies matching the old man’s words exactly.\n\nJing Zhiguo was also a man of the Dao. He lived on Doufu Mountain, dwelling among tigers and leopards, which he tamed like household dogs. Several crows perched on his shoulders and arms, chirping and playing as if it were ordinary. A giant serpent would sometimes appear, but when Zhiguo scolded and dismissed it, it would slither away. Three or four tigers would often wrestle in his courtyard on moonlit nights, their fierce struggles shaking the ground. Enraged, Zhiguo would seize a white staff and strike them, scattering them in retreat. Beside his abode grew creeping vines, and rabbits would lie undisturbed among them. He could move them with his hands as if they were cats or dogs. Such was his intimacy with extraordinary creatures.\n\nOne day, he vanished without a trace. Wang, an aide in Fengzhou, was at the time serving in the chancellery of Minister Man. Among the staff, Wang was particularly close to the aides. A guest named Ren Sanlang was also present, well-known to the chancellery officials but especially intimate with Wang. One day, Ren suddenly said to Wang, \"If you encounter a minor setback, consider it your good fortune.\" A month later, Wang unexpectedly fell out of the minister’s favor. Claiming illness, he remained secluded for over a hundred days, during which the minister ignored him entirely, and all communication ceased. Ren visited occasionally. One day, he told Wang, \"This place is about to face disaster. The great tree on the official street has withered—trouble is approaching. When its leaves fall, the event will unfold. Hurry and seek a physician to escape this calamity.\" Wang, still wary of the minister’s lingering anger, hesitated. Ren said, \"Submit three petitions, and you will receive instructions.\" Following his advice, Wang submitted three petitions within days, requesting leave to seek medical treatment in the Guanzhong region. Soon after, an envoy arrived with the minister’s encouragement, urging him to depart immediately. He was given bolts of silk and other gifts far more generous than usual. Wang then entered to express his gratitude. The minister hosted a farewell banquet and presented him with brocades and embroidered fabrics. Upon returning home, he was pressed to leave for the north within ten days. At the outskirts, Minister Man hosted a farewell feast, bestowing over two hundred gifts. Fifteen or sixteen days later, Wang arrived in Wushan County and took up residence. Another ten days passed before news from Fengzhou arrived: a military mutiny had erupted. Minister Man fled to Baozhong, and all his staff perished in the disaster. Wang alone escaped misfortune. Later, he inquired about Ren’s whereabouts and visited his former residence, but Ren had vanished without a trace.\n\nHuang Qi was a low-ranking officer in the palace guard. For many years, he had been devoted to the Dao and performed secret good deeds. On Chaotian Ridge, he encountered an old man with snowy hair and beard, his complexion like that of a child, his skin smooth as jade. The old man said to him, \"Since you are devoted to the Dao, in five years you will face great peril. I will surely save you. Cultivate hidden virtues and do not abandon your resolve.\" Later, Huang Qi traveled downstream through the gorges. His boat capsized, and he was swept to a shoal. As if aided by an unseen force, he reached the shore—only to find the old man from before. The old man soon disappeared, but Huang Qi would occasionally encounter him again. One day, he saw him in a market in Shiyu County and was invited to his home. They left the city through the north gate and walked through a forest for two or three *li* before arriving. The mountains, streams, and woods formed a secluded and beautiful landscape. Huang Qi stayed the night. The old man said, \"The mountains and rivers of Shu are a land of great fortune, destined to be an imperial capital. Many sages of past dynasties have suppressed its dragon veins, delaying its rise. I know all these places well. Also, the character for *Shu* (蜀), if you remove the *chong* (虫) and add *jin* (金), becomes *zheng* (正), signifying the enduring power of metal. The king of the west will unify the realm. You should tell others this.\" At dawn, the old man saw him to the gate, and Huang Qi found himself in the mountains behind the city, over seventy *li* from the county. Upon returning, he told others of this, but there was no way to report it. Huang Qi died a few months later.\n\nThe Daoist Wang Faxuan of Kuizhou had a large and long tongue, which made his speech unclear. He deeply regretted this. He vowed to recite the *Dao De Jing* and dreamed that Lord Lao adjusted his tongue. Upon waking, his words became clear and sharp. He mastered the recitation of the Five Thousand Characters and experienced many auspicious signs.\n\nThe Daoist Hao Fazun resided at the Simplicity and Tranquility Abbey on Mount Lu, his Daoist practice precise and rigorous. For years, he labored alone in his duties, without any disciples. One night, he dreamed that the Master of the Mystic Realm said to him, \"You have no one to assist you and work most diligently. Now, two young boys shall come to you—only regrettable that they are still small.\" Upon waking, he recounted the dream to others. When he left the mountain and passed through a village, a family named Wang had a child barely a year old. At the sight of Fazun, the child clung to his feet and would not let go. After Fazun departed, the child wept day and night for days on end. Yet when Fazun returned, the child greeted him joyfully. The parents said, \"In three to five years, we shall offer him to you as a novice.\" Another boy, surnamed Liu, had eyes that emitted light of five colors. His parents, deeming this strange, cauterized the corners of his eyes, and the light vanished. When he was four or five years old, they offered him to the abbey. Now grown, he has entered the Dao in succession, fulfilling the words of the dream from the Mystic Realm.\n\nThe Vice Director of Hunan, Gentleman Zheng Wanting of the Bureau of Judicature and Revision, now serves as Prefect of Lianzhou. Once, while at the foot of Mount Heng, he entrusted a letter to his elder brother, the Fish Supervisor, in a coarse hempen robe. When his son was born, seven cranes circled above their dwelling. On the seventh day, seven cranes returned. On the one hundred twentieth day, twenty-seven cranes arrived together. The sky was clear, the clouds and atmosphere slightly unusual, and they lingered for the entire day before departing. The child born was of a most pure and sincere nature, his bearing dignified and solemn. He was thus named \"Crane.\" This occurred in the *gengshen* year of the Tianfu era.\n\nThe Daoist Jiao Huang of Mount Siming recorded this matter in his annals.\n\nOne day, the Grand Preceptor Li Deyu of Dunhuang received a visit from an old man at his gate, accompanied by five or six others. They ascended a great tree and requested an audience. Though the gatekeepers sought to turn them away, the Grand Preceptor, intrigued, received them. The old man said, \"My family has treasured this mulberry wood for three generations. Now that I am aged, I am moved by your love of the rare and extraordinary, and wish to present it to you. Within this wood lies a wondrous treasure. If one skilled enough cuts it, something extraordinary will surely be found. In Luoyang, there is a craftsman, though by now he may be old or even deceased. His descendants, however, should have inherited his techniques. None but a Luoyang craftsman can cut this wood.\" The Grand Preceptor followed his advice and inquired in Luoyang, only to find the craftsman had passed away. His son, summoned to attend, examined the wood and said, \"This may be cut slowly.\" He then split it into two pipa soundboards. Naturally, they bore the form of white wagtails, with wings, claws, and feet all perfectly rendered in minute detail. Yet the craftsman’s slight miscalculation in thickness left one wagtail missing a wing. The Grand Preceptor presented the complete one to the throne and kept the other for himself. It remains among the people to this day. Lu Yanrang, Vice Director of the Bureau of Waterways, learned of this from the Grand Preceptor’s grandson.\n\nIn the northern frontier of Hongzhou, at the Great Five Wharves, there lived a man of the Hu clan, whose given name is now lost. The Hu family was once poor, with five sons, the youngest of whom was of extraordinary bearing. After his birth, the family’s fortunes gradually improved. Through farming and sericulture, their strength grew abundant, and the villagers all marveled at them. The family sent this son to transport wheat by boat downriver to the market in the prefectural city. Before reaching their destination, they encountered a treacherous stretch of riverbank where the towpath was impassable, forcing them to cross the current. As the boat neared the shore, the force of the water proved uncontrollable, and the sand gave way beneath the collapsing bank. In the hollow thus exposed, they discovered several million coins. Abandoning the wheat, they loaded the money and returned home. From then on, the family grew ever wealthier, purchasing servants and horses, adorning themselves in fine attire. All said this son was blessed with fortune and unsuited to remain long in the village. Thus, they sent him to frequent the cities, where he gradually grew accustomed to worldly affairs.\n\nOne day, mid-journey, the horse he rode suddenly pawed at the ground and refused to advance. Turning to his servant, he said, \"Where the boat struck the shore and we found money, the horse’s stamping may likewise conceal something.\" He ordered his attendants to dig, and they unearthed five hundred taels of gold, which they took home.\n\nLater, while visiting the city, he encountered a foreign merchant who, recognizing a pearl embedded in his skull, had someone lure him. Familiar with the man’s easy nature, they plied him with wine and took the pearl. Originally, a fleshy protrusion the shape of a half-sphere had risen on his forehead. After losing the pearl, the flesh sank inward. Upon returning home, his kin and friends all sighed in astonishment. Thereafter, the son’s spirit waned, and he fell ill and died. The family’s livelihood also gradually declined.\n\nZhao Zhong, Prefectural Governor of Xuancheng, likewise bore a fleshy protrusion on his forehead, leading people to suspect he too possessed a pearl. Later, when the Huainan army seized his counties, Zhao was killed by rebel soldiers. A soldier searching for his head split open his forehead, retrieved the pearl, and sold it to a foreign merchant. The merchant said, \"This man’s pearl is now dead and cannot be used again,\" so he sold it to artisans who fashioned it into a pearl for a Buddha’s forehead.\n\nZhao Wunu was a native of Shijing in Hezhou, residing on the grounds of the Dayun Temple. Early in his mother’s pregnancy, she gave birth to a tiger, which was cast into the river. After several more months, she bore a giant turtle, which was also discarded. Another few months passed, and she delivered a yaksha, over a foot tall, which too was abandoned. Several months later, she gave birth to Wunu. His eyebrows, eyes, ears, nose, and mouth were all perfectly formed, but from the neck down, his body resembled a severed gourd. He had shoulders and armpits, with two arms each several inches long, lacking elbows but with wrists and palms sprouting from round flesh, each hand bearing six fingers barely an inch long, complete with nails. Below, he had two feet, each one or two inches in length, also with six toes. At birth, his parents could not bear to abandon him. As he grew, he reached just over two feet in height. Skilled in water, he could navigate boats. His nature was cunning and clever, his speech sharp and persuasive, and he took great pleasure in killing. He made his living by fishing and butchering pigs. Whenever there were boat races, puppet shows, or competitions in singing *zhuzhi* songs, he invariably took first place. In market transactions, he always served as broker. He shaved his head and wore black robes, so the people called him Master Zhao. In his later years, he was merely bald with a white robe. Sometimes, when bowing or kneeling, he would tumble to the ground, exposing his form, much to the amusement of onlookers. When traveling far by donkey, he had someone carry him sideways in the saddle, like a bundle of clothes.\n\nHe had two wives and a daughter, living in comfort. Yet when he quarreled with his family, none could restrain him. In the early years of the Qiande reign, he was nearly sixty, with a waist and belly several spans around, his face and features no different from an ordinary man. His daughter’s right ring finger was seven or eight inches long, also unlike others.\n\nWhen Fu Jian first established his rule in Guanzhong, a tall man appeared and spoke to the commoner Zhang Jing, saying, \"Fu Jian has received the Mandate of Heaven, and now peace shall prevail. Those beyond the center shall return to it and know tranquility.\" When asked his name, he did not answer and soon vanished. The magistrate of Xinping reported this to Fu Jian, who deemed it heresy and imprisoned Zhang Jing. During a great downpour, the river at Pujin Ferry in the Wei region overflowed, and a supervisor named Kou Deng retrieved a sandal from the water. It measured seven feet and three inches in length. When compared to a man’s footprint, its toes were over a foot long, with tread marks an inch deep. Fu Jian sighed and said, \"What is there not between heaven and earth?\" He declared that Zhang Jing’s account was surely not false and pardoned him.\n\nIn Jizhou, atop East Mountain, there stood a Daoist abbey, separated from the Xiao River and sixty *li* from the prefectural seat. During the Xiantong era, a Master Yang resided there. The master possessed Daoist arts and could dispatch talismans to heal the afflicted. Beside the abbey lay three wells: one yielded water for washing, another for tea, and the third for fermented beans. Whenever something was lacking, the master would command its retrieval, and all could be consumed, curing various ailments. After the master attained the Way, however, nothing more could be drawn from them.\n\nBeneath the city of Shaozhou, in a deep pool south of the great river, during the Kaiyuan era, the Heavenly Master Shen Yuanzhi concealed three stone caskets of Daoist scriptures at the pool’s bottom. Yuanzhi was skilled in the arts of the Three and Five Prohibitions and incantations, and to this day, many in Shaozhou still practice these arts, which are known as the Southern Methods.\n\nWhite Crane Mountain, under the jurisdiction of Xiangyin County in Yuezhou, borders the Tan and Li prefectures. It was the site where the Jin-dynasty Perfected Lord Tao raised his dwelling to ascend to heaven, and the Abbey of Perfected Lord Tao stands there still. Though the mountain is not particularly deep, neither weapons nor bandits have ever reached it. Several hundred households dwell there in peace, untroubled by any peril.\n\nThe recluse Hu Tian chose this place for his dwelling. His father had served as the prefect of Yanzhou, yet Tian alone cherished the Dao, reclining high amidst the clouds and forests. He was skilled in the arts of yin-yang divination, celestial observation, calendar calculation, alchemy, and the transmutation of base metals into gold. He was also versed in Peng Su’s methods, *Yijing* divination, talismanic script, clerical calligraphy, and poetic composition, mastering each to its fullest. In regulating his primal qi and refining his spirit, he devoted himself solely to the pursuit of immortality.\n\nIn the Jingfu era, while in Anzhou, he encountered Ma Chuqian of Shangcai, a fortune-teller who, despite his blindness, dutifully served his parents with filial piety. Moved by his plight—his learning incomplete and his provisions meager—Tian took him into the mountains and taught him the secrets of astrological calculation and prognostication. After more than a year, when his studies were complete, Tian sent him back down the mountain.\n\nAt that time, Ezhou suffered from a severe drought. Chancellor Du Hong met with Tian and spoke of prayers for rain. Tian examined the omens, cast a cinnabar talisman into the river, and soon a great downpour followed, bringing relief to the entire region. Though he was richly rewarded with gold and silk, he departed without a glance. Even summons from feudal lords could not sway him, and to this day, he remains in the mountains. He once admonished Chuqian: \"What I have learned is for myself, not for others. Because you are pure in filial devotion and reverent in conduct, I have taught you. If you seek to secure lifelong abundance through the arts of alchemy and transmutation, I could tell you, but it would only hasten your misfortune and cut short your life—something I would not regret. Do not boast of your knowledge or speak carelessly to invite calamity.\"\n\n\"All people are born of the five qi, which rise and fall; yin and yang wax and wane; the five planets move in direct and retrograde motion; and fate unfolds with fortune and misfortune. Yet those who accumulate good deeds bequeath blessings, while those who accumulate evil bequeath disaster. By observing one’s conduct, one may foresee calamity or prosperity. If goodness is not cultivated, no prayers or exorcisms can avert it.\"\n\nThus, though Chuqian would later speak of fortune and misfortune to others, he never performed rituals of exorcism or suppression. Later, he entered service in Shu as a minor general and was appointed Acting Minister of Works.\n\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll Two ends here.\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll Three begins.\n\nThe Honorable Du Guangting, Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, President of the Board of Revenue in the Department of State Affairs, and Duke of Cai in the Guangcheng Prefecture, compiled this with reverence.\n\nIn the second year of Guangqi, the cyclical year bingwu, on the second day of the first month, renwu by the calendar, troops from Hedong entered the capital. At that time, the imperial carriage had already departed for Chen Cang, and the feudal lords arrived in succession to pay their respects. The Hedong commander searched the capital for court officials and discovered Minister of Ceremonies Niu Cong and three or four of his nephews in the well of Xinchang Ward. Along with military officer Lu Qian, they were to be taken to Hedong. Lu Qian, however, fell ill and was left by the well. Upon arriving in Hedong, Niu Cong was received with reverence by the Prince of Jin, who honored him beyond the respect due a teacher. Niu Cong, in turn, expounded to him the Way of loyalty and filial piety, as well as the rites of ruler and minister. The Prince of Jin also frequently consulted him on matters of court precedent, governance, and essential principles.\n\nIn the sixth month of that year, Emperor Xizong took refuge in Baoliang. Xiao Gou and Pei Che established the Prince of Xiang in Chang’an, proclaiming him Regent. The regions surrounding the capital, as well as Jiangnan and Hebei, all circulated the Prince of Xiang’s edicts to pacify the people. Some were granted ranks and titles, while others were ordered to present tribute. The court also dispatched Remonstrance Official Zheng Hejing and eunuch emissaries bearing edicts and patents to Hedong. Niu Cong said to the Prince of Jin: “We hear that the Emperor has halted his progress in Chen Cang and may soon proceed south to Liangyang. The enthronement of the Prince of Xiang does not enjoy the people’s support. Xiao and Pei, envious of the power held by the capital’s officials, did not wish to follow the Emperor south and thus made this move. With the true ruler still abroad, the Prince of Xiang’s edicts are not legitimate.” The Prince of Jin was startled and enraged. He executed the envoys and burned their edicts.\n\nFor over a month, the roads were blocked, and no further news of the court reached them. Niu Cong grew deeply anxious and distressed, which aggravated his illness. The Prince of Jin repeatedly sent physicians and medicines, even visiting him in person to urge him to eat, but his condition did not improve. Lu Qian, having recovered from his illness, begged for food along the roads from the Western Capital, seeking news of Niu Cong, and eventually reached Hedong. The Prince of Jin, admiring his loyalty, appointed him to a high office and said to his generals and officers: “If one serves his lord with such devotion as Lu Qian, I would strip off my own robes to clothe him and share my food with him. How could I begrudge him high rank or great rewards?”\n\nOne day, a physician suddenly told Niu Cong a rumor from the road: the Prince of Xiang had taken the throne, and the Emperor had passed away. Niu Cong cried out in grief, vomited blood, and collapsed. After a long while, he revived and drafted a final memorial, earnestly extolling the Prince of Jin’s loyalty, filial piety, and sincerity. He lamented his own age and illness, which prevented him from following the Emperor to pay his respects. His words were fervent and moving, stirring the emotions of all who read them. Weeping bitterly, he laid down his brush and died.\n\nThe Prince of Jin was stricken with grief for a long time. He executed the physician in retribution. He then dispatched a courier to submit Niu Cong’s memorial via Lu Qian to the imperial presence in Qifu. The Emperor, upon hearing of it, issued an edict praising Niu Cong’s loyalty and posthumously enfeoffed him as Duke of Loyalty and Integrity. Lu Qian was appointed Prefect of Huazhou.\n\nWhile Emperor Xizong was in Shu, he appointed Wang Dong, a Gentleman of the Ministry of Civil Appointments, as Magistrate of Wannian County and concurrently Vice Censor-in-Chief. Wang was the first to return to the capital. In the yisi year, when the imperial carriage returned to Chang’an, he was promoted to Right Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary. On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, the cyclical day yihai, the Hedong army breached the palace gates. At the third watch of the night, the Emperor fled to Baoji. Wang, who was then ill, could not follow to protect the imperial carriage. He took refuge in Pingkang Ward and later fled to the foot of the Southern Mountains. From then on, he shut his door and lived in seclusion, nursing his illness for months.\n\nThat summer, the Prince of Xiang assumed control in the capital. His decrees were harsh and urgent, and Xiao and Pei wielded power, instilling fear both within and beyond the court. Wang, feeling increasingly uneasy, rose from his sickbed. When the false edict arrived, appointing him Left Cavalier Attendant, he claimed illness and did not attend court, refusing the Prince of Xiang’s envoys. The imperial physicians examined him and offered medicines, but he accepted nothing. He wept bitterly and died. When the court and the people heard of it, none did not mourn his loss.\n\nWhen Emperor Xizong took refuge in Shu, Huang Chao captured Chang’an. Court officials from north and south arrived in succession to pay their respects. Before long, the Commandant of the Palace Guard, Zhang Zhifang, and the Chief Minister, Liu Ye, along with other officials at Cong, secretly discussed fleeing to the imperial court. The bandits discovered their plot and executed many. From then on, the roads to the east were blocked, and the capital was cut off from the outside world. Yet the capital still held vast stores of grain.\n\nThe skilled artisan Liu Wanyu, the musician Deng Manyi, the acrobat Zhaixing Hu, and the paper-cutter Mi Sheng secretly conferred: “The great bandits are invincible, and the capital’s granaries are full. Though the regional lords do not submit and no goods enter from outside, the supplies here could last for years. We have received the state’s favor and deeply wish to repay its kindness, but we have no means to escape and are forced to serve the rebels. Let us offer a strategy to exhaust their supplies. If no goods come from outside and the internal stores are depleted, they will collapse within a year or two.”\n\nLiu Wanyu, favored by Huang Chao for his skill, often attended him closely. He spoke to Huang Chao in a casual manner: “The parks, gardens, and city walls of Chang’an extend for nearly a hundred li. If external forces attack, we must have defenses ready; otherwise, holding the city will be difficult. I propose that from Wangxian Gate northward, encompassing Xuánwǔ and Báihǔ Gates, we build extensive walls and moats, erect watchtowers and battlements, and prepare defenses to repel attacks. This will ensure long-term security.” Huang Chao was pleased and rewarded him for his loyalty. He immediately ordered that two hundred thousand laborers be conscripted from the two wards, each to receive two sheng of rice and forty coins per day. The left and right armies were to provide four thousand piculs of rice and eight thousand strings of cash.\n\nOver a year later, the work remained unfinished, and the walls were not completed. The granaries of the Grand Storehouse were opened to feed the laborers, and later, elm bark was stripped to supply the imperial kitchens. The walls were never finished. Liu Wanyu, fearing the bandits would discover his scheme, fled to Heyang. He fell ill the following year and died.\n\nDeng Manyi was a master of the pipa, and the Music Bureau ranked him foremost among all musicians. Huang Chao grew rather intimate with him and, under the pretext of treating a wind-induced ailment, had his right hand seared with moxibustion, so that he could never play again. Though Huang Chao treated him with great generosity and never once asked him to take up his instrument and perform, every few days he would summon Deng into the palace and bestow upon him gold and silk. One day, Deng said to his friend: “I have heard that men of loyalty and integrity choose death and nothing more. I have been repeatedly pressed by this great bandit, yet I have never bent my principles to play for him. Today, when I am summoned, I shall go to my death and not return.” He bid farewell to his wife, daughter, and son. The messenger urged him onward, and so he entered to see Huang Chao. Huang Chao said to him with delight: “The musicians of the Music Bureau rank your artistry first among all, yet you have long claimed a wind-induced ailment. I have trusted and waited for you—could you not play just two or three notes on the pipa? You need not perform an entire piece.” Deng Manyi replied: “I was born to serve in the ranks of the crimson and purple, and all was bestowed upon me by the Son of Heaven of Tang. How could I bear to betray the grace of the former court and take this joy to delight another?” Huang Chao flew into a rage and ordered him beheaded, then slaughtered his entire family.\n\nZhaixing Hu’s younger brother was a skilled archer, never missing his mark. Huang Chao cherished him, dressed him in brocade robes, and always had him ride at the front of his procession. When the official troops seized Weiqiao, Huang Chao personally led his forces to resist them. Upon reaching the bridge, he ordered Zhaixing Hu’s brother to draw his bow and shoot. Though he loosed over ten arrows, all flew far but struck nothing. Huang Chao asked him: “Why do your arrows reach such distance yet hit nothing?” He replied: “The soldiers of the sagely Tang are either kin or comrades to me—how could I strike them?” Huang Chao grew enraged and killed him as well.\n\nThe man of Zizhou, Yin Xuanzhi, had studied the Five Classics since youth and was especially proficient in the *Records of the Grand Historian*. When his father passed away, he built a hut by the grave and wept at the six canonical hours. Often, mountain dragons and tigers joined their roars to his wailing, and in time, even ghosts and spirits aided his lament. Each night, two lanterns would come to illuminate the grave, lingering until dawn. Later, when his mother died, he remained in mourning at her graveside for six years. Though his thatched hut collapsed, he never repaired it, dwelling instead in an earthen pit. Afflicted by a debilitating *qi* disorder, his waist and legs weakened, and his voice grew hoarse, yet he never tired of reciting and lecturing. He often told others: “To seek fame and office is not for myself. Both my parents are gone, and my salary could never have supported them—what use is reputation?” Thus, he never sat for the imperial examinations, enduring poverty all his life, and died at over eighty years of age.\n\nYang Taibo, also of Zizhou, at sixteen observed three years of mourning at his parents’ graves. Divine lanterns shone upon the tomb, fierce tigers grew docile, and a white hare appeared as a marvel. When the news reached the Chancellor of Shu, Wang Gong, he reported it to the throne, which issued an edict of praise and commendation, bestowing an honorary placard upon his gate.\n\nJulong Hongdao lived at the foot of Mount Zitong, south of Yanwu Pavilion. He built his mourning hut beside the official road, and though he lived past eighty, his hair grew over ten feet long. Upon each of his parents’ graves sprouted a single stalk of purple *lingzhi*, six or seven inches tall. Wild beasts grew tame in his presence, as if by custom.\n\nIn the *xinchou* year of the Guangming era, when Emperor Xizong fled to Shu, he personally visited Hongdao’s residence and sat upon a great stone in the courtyard. Hongdao later built a pavilion to shelter the stone. In the *yisi* year, when the imperial cortege returned, the emperor again visited, bestowing abundant gifts of money, silk, and clothing, as he had on the journey there. While the court resided in Jianzhou, an edict exempted Hongdao from taxes for three years and granted him an imperial banner in commendation.\n\nIn the section on *Ganying* (Responsive Manifestations):\nJiajiang Magistrate of Jiazhou, Zhu Bo, a *Jianxiao Gongbu Shangshu*, once fell ill while in office. His limbs became immobile, his entire body heavy and sluggish. Turning over required several attendants to lift him, and though he was treated for wind-induced paralysis, neither medicine nor remedies proved effective. Suddenly, his eyes grew painful and convulsed, tormenting him day and night.\n\nAfter several more days, he suddenly grew parched, craving water and hot drinks in quantities beyond measure. Another few days passed, and his mind became wild and restless, as if perceiving visions. Had his body not been so sluggish and immobile, he would have torn his hair and fled in madness, fearing nothing. Within ten days, four afflictions struck in succession, and the peril of his condition seemed to leave him but a day or two.\n\nExhausted from sleepless nights, at the point of utter fatigue, he drifted into a state between waking and sleep. There before him sat seven immortals, each no taller than five or six inches, their robes, caps, brows, eyes, beards, and hair all distinctly visible. Five sat in a row, while two sat crosswise at the sides. Zhu Bo thought to himself, *I am sitting upright—how can they sit crosswise?* Suddenly, he heard a voice from the empty air beside him respond: *\"As immortals, nothing is impossible. Why be surprised at crosswise seating?\"* The voice vanished, and so too did the seven immortals.\n\nFrom then on, he often felt as though hands grasped and manipulated his limbs, patting and rubbing his back and arms. His illness gradually lessened, and his insatiable thirst for cold water and hot drinks halved at once. Within three to five days, he could manage official duties and receive guests, his ailments fully healed. In gratitude, he had an image of the Seven True Persons of the Northern Dipper painted for veneration.\n\nDaoist Ritual Officer and Right Vice Director of the Imperial Secretariat Yin Guang fell ill in the third year of the Yongping era. At first, he suffered from diarrhea, passing stool fifty or sixty times a day and night. Over time, this turned into a feverish madness of the heart, his speech growing unrestrained and forgetful. Often, he would try to dash about recklessly, requiring his entire household to restrain him. Soon, his limbs became paralyzed, his body heavy and sluggish. Each time he rose or sat, four or five attendants had to support him just to lean against a table.\n\nAfter several more months, his family, worn from constant vigil, suddenly saw an old man with white beard and temples, dressed in white, approach Yin Guang and say: *\"Your illness has taken effect—why not rise quickly?\"* He then lifted Yin Guang’s head, and at once, Yin Guang could sit up. Moments later, he rose on his own to trim the lamp and pour oil, then went to the bed to put on his shoes. Glancing around, he saw his servants all asleep and did not wish to wake them. Taking up a candle, he left the room, walked the entire residence, and then returned to his place. His household was astonished, and from that day, he fully recovered.\n\n*A Strange Dream*\n\nThe Minister of Rites, Yu Pu, was much acclaimed when he sat for the imperial examinations, certain his name would be inscribed on the roster. One night, he dreamed he entered the Osmanthus Palace and plucked a branch of osmanthus, but upon returning, those who asked to see it found the branch already withered and dry. Soon after, he failed the examinations. That same year, he married a woman of the Gui clan. After the wedding procession, within ten days, he secretly observed a mark the width of a finger on his wife’s forehead, where she habitually applied artemisia oil. When asked, she explained: *\"As a child, I was burned by fire, leaving a scar where no hair grows.\"* Thus, she was also called Lady Osmanthus. In the end, Yu Pu never passed the examinations.\n\nZong Kui, Prefect of Yuanzhou, during the *guangtian* era, dreamed thrice of a steelyard weighing ten thousand *jin*. In his dream, he hung the steelyard from the ridgepole of a tower, but suddenly, both pole and scale snapped. He awoke with deep foreboding. On the eighth day of the tenth month that year, the *wushen* day, he died at the age of sixty-one.\n\nIn the first month of the *xinchou* year of *Guangming*, Emperor Xizong’s imperial carriage had already reached the outskirts of Zuomian and Guoxian. The garrison commander, Ren Shi, was napping in the hall at midday when he suddenly dreamed a street patrol officer announced: *\"The Great General is coming to welcome the imperial carriage—you must await him by the roadside.\"* Ren rushed to the side of the thoroughfare, where thousands of cavalry and infantry were already marching due north. Their banners and ranks were extraordinarily disciplined, their weapons and armor magnificent, stretching over ten *li* without break. Countless armored warriors dragged their metal scales along the ground, while at the center rode a general on a white horse, crimson tassels adorning his golden armor, flanked by banners emblazoned with the sun and moon in five colors. Ren bowed deeply for the time it takes to eat two meals before the procession finally passed. He asked a messenger: *\"Who is the Great General?\"* The reply came: *\"General Li, who once resided behind the Fading Law Temple.\"* When Ren awoke, his body was drenched in sweat, and the vision remained vivid before his eyes. That year, I was ordered to perform rites at Qingcheng, where I recounted this event, and Guangting recorded it.\n\n*Record of Marvels, Volume Three concluded*\n*Record of Marvels, Volume Four*\n\nThe Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, President of the Board of Revenue in the Department of State Affairs, Lord of Broad Achievement, Duke of Cai, Minister Du Guangting, having compiled accounts of spirits and gods, records:\n\nThe presented scholar Cui, traveling from the Guanzhong region to sit for the imperial examinations, was journeying early one morning more than ten *li* beyond Tong Pass. The fifth watch had just struck, and the road was deserted—only himself, a servant, a sedan-chair, and a donkey. Suddenly, he encountered a procession bearing torches in ranks, with banners, spears, and armor, some two hundred men strong, resembling the retinue of a commissioner. Cui concealed himself behind a locust tree until they passed, then continued on his way. Before he had gone two or three *li*, the same procession turned back. He hid again, then proceeded cautiously. Following behind was a sturdy foot soldier carrying a tea chest, moving slowly. Cui asked who they were, and the soldier replied: *\"This is the Marshal of the Sacred Peak, escorting the Celestial Official. The official’s surname is Cui, and he is called Attendant Gentleman, a candidate entering the Pass to sit for the examinations. Why not pay him a visit to divine your prospects?\"* Cui demurred, saying he had no means of introduction, but the soldier offered to inquire on his behalf.\n\nWhen they reached the temple gate, the sky had not yet brightened. The soldier instructed Cui to wait by the side of the gate while he took the tea chest inside. After a long while, he emerged and said: *\"The Attendant Gentleman will receive you.\"* He promptly led Cui inside, where they met with extraordinary delight. The Attendant Gentleman detained him in the guest quarters. Soon after, the Marshal of the Sacred Peak arrived, exchanged words, and invited the Attendant Gentleman into the temple. There, tents and banquet mats were arranged, and the entertainment—singing girls and musicians—was lavish. As music played and wine flowed, the Attendant Gentleman, preparing to attend the feast, ordered his attendants to serve Cui with all due courtesy, providing tea and whatever else he required, treating him with utmost warmth. After some time drinking, Cui grew weary and strolled about, unconsciously wandering out the gate. Suddenly, he saw his maternal uncle-by-marriage. They clasped hands and spoke of old times. The uncle’s complexion was gaunt, his clothes tattered and threadbare. He wept as he asked after Cui, who replied: *\"Uncle, it seems you departed the world of men long ago. How is it I meet you here?\"* The uncle answered: *\"I left the human realm fifteen years ago. I have yet to find a post, and recently became the spirit of Fu Shui Bridge. Weary of endless receptions and plagued by want of food and clothing, my straits are dire. I heard you were on good terms with the Celestial Official, the Attendant Gentleman, and as we share the same clan name, I thought you might recommend me. I have come to plead my case. If you could mention my name, and I were appointed a minor spirit of the Southern Mountains, I might at least escape hunger and poverty. Thereafter, I could be promoted to a celestial rank and leave this wretched underworld behind.\"* Cui replied that they had only just met and he did not know if a recommendation were possible, but he would try. With that, he returned to the Attendant Gentleman’s quarters, where the feast soon ended, and he took his leave.\n\nAfter pondering for some time, he said, \"You will pass the imperial examination the year after next, but even if you do not sit for it this year, it will still come to pass. My official duties will soon be concluded, and I must return at once—the schedule is pressing, and I cannot linger long.\" Thereupon, Cui presented the request from his father-in-law. The Attendant Gentleman replied, \"A *zishen* post is akin to a hereditary office among men, a most refined position. The spirit of Fu Shui Bridge holds a low and miscellaneous rank—how could such an appointment be easily secured? Still, I shall try to mention it. The Mountain Spirit will surely not refuse.\" He then went to pay his respects to the Mountain Spirit, and Cui secretly drew near to listen. He heard every word of the request, and the Mountain Spirit indeed granted it. An edict was immediately issued for the appointment, and soon after, the new *zishen* received the document, bowed in gratitude, and was escorted away by a retinue of one or two hundred officials and attendants, all in perfect order.\n\nCui stepped outside to offer his congratulations. The *zishen*, moved to tears, said, \"Were it not for your intercession, I could never have attained this position. After my next promotion, I shall enter the celestial bureaucracy. This year, the Earth Spirit reported that the Wei River would overflow, and your estate was to be swept away, along with all the households upstream and downstream—some three to five hundred families. I have already been ordered to protect your land. By the fifth or sixth month, you will be spared this disaster, and I shall receive five hundred bolts of silk in gratitude.\"\n\nIn an instant, the *zishen* departed with his entourage, and the Attendant Gentleman also took leave of the Mountain Spirit, seeing Cui off. Alone in the temple, Cui felt as if waking from a dream. He stepped outside to seek his servants, who were still at the inn, having seen nothing. Thereupon, he did not re-enter the pass but returned instead to his villa. That summer, the Wei River did overflow, causing great destruction—only Cui’s estate was spared. Before the estate stood an empty boat; after the waters receded, it held five hundred bolts of silk. Cui was thus further convinced of the truth of the matter. The following year, he indeed passed the imperial examination. This account was later related by Wang Daqing, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.\n\nLord Duan Wenchang of Zouping, a man of talent who scorned the vulgar, wandered destitute through Jing and Chu. Often half-drunk, he would stroll the streets of Jiangling in clogs, heedless of the mud after rain. Beside the road stood a grand residence, its gate fronting a flowing canal. Once, in his cups, he sat by the canal, removed his clogs, and washed his feet, utterly indifferent to onlookers. He declared, \"When I become Military Commissioner of Jiangling, I shall buy this house.\" Those who heard him covered their mouths and laughed. Yet within a few years, he was indeed appointed to govern Jiangnan, and he purchased the very residence.\n\nHe had once served as an aide to the Grand Marshal, Prince Nan Kang of the Wei clan, acting as a postal inspector in Chengdu. One day, falling out of favor, the prince dismissed him and assigned him to the minor post of magistrate of Lingchi. In haste, he accepted the commission, setting out with a frail servant and a feeble horse. Six or seven *li* from Lingchi, as dusk deepened and the road emptied of travelers, two torches suddenly appeared ahead, guiding him. A voice called out, \"The Grand Marshal approaches!\" As he reached the city gate, the torches vanished. He knocked for some time before the magistrate sent someone to admit him.\n\nLater, when the prince was dispatched to Chang’an on a mission, Lord Duan befriended Liu Yuxi, who then served as Vice Minister of Rites. One day, as Liu conversed with a diviner, Lord Duan arrived unexpectedly. The diviner hid behind a bamboo screen, and after Lord Duan departed, he emerged, telling Liu, \"If you seek promotion within the ministry, the prospects are distant—you must wait a decade. Only after this guest becomes chancellor will you be appointed Director of the Bureau of Rites.\" Thereafter, Liu fell into disfavor and was repeatedly assigned to provincial posts. A decade later, when Lord Duan became chancellor, Liu was indeed appointed Director of the Bureau of Rites and returned to the capital, just as the diviner had foretold.\n\nIn the summer of the *gengwu* year during the reign of the Shu court, heavy rains swelled the Min River, threatening to breach the Dujiangyan weir at the mouth of the Jing River. That night, voices and clamor arose from the weir, as if hundreds of men bearing countless torches had gathered. Amid a violent storm, the torchlight remained unquenched. By dawn, the great weir had shifted several hundred *zhang*, diverting the waters into the Xinjin River. The banners in Li Bing’s shrine were soaked. Huang Jing, the magistrate of Daojiang, and the garrison commander jointly reported the event. At the time, Xinjin, Jia, and Mei suffered severe flooding, yet the Jing River did not overflow.\n\nWhen Zheng Junxiong was prefect of Suizhou, one evening he suddenly saw what appeared to be thousands of soldiers and banners encamped within the water’s embrace. Flags, tents, and bustling figures resembled a marching army. Too fearful to investigate, he could not discern their origin. The prefecture was placed on sudden alert, but by dawn, when scouts were sent to reconnoiter, the army had vanished, leaving only three or five stragglers. When questioned, they replied, \"We are the river’s drowned spirits.\" Years later, unrest in the provincial capital forced its relocation to the Three Gorges, and peace was restored. Upon returning to the region, Zheng sent men to inspect the site, where traces of encampments and firelight remained, all verifiable.\n\nIn a village on the east bank of Suizhou, known as Tang Village, an ancient figure was once seen standing by the roadside—clad in flowing robes with wide sleeves and an archaic cap. He addressed the villagers, saying, \"I am Lord Zhongli, the Great King. My old temple, a thousand *li* downstream, was destroyed by floods. My statue has now drifted upstream and will soon arrive. Build me a temple here.\" The villagers searched the river and found a wooden effigy, several *chi* tall. They erected a temple at the site where the figure had appeared, naming it the Spirit of Tang Village. To this day, prayers for rain or drought there are never unanswered. Some say the figure’s initial appearance resembled that of a Daoist priest.\n\nIn Guangdu County stood the Temple of Pan’gu the Third Lord, renowned for its efficacy. Any who passed its gates without showing proper reverence would suffer immediate consequences—being struck or stumbling on the road. Thus, people near and far feared and respected it. A county resident named Yang Zhiyu, who had received the Register of Orthodox Unity and Alliance威, once returned home drunk one night. The road was long, the moon dark. Passing the temple gate, he cried out, \"I am a disciple of Orthodox Unity! Drunk and moonless, with no companion to guide me home, I beseech your divine power to light my way!\" Suddenly, a torch emerged from the temple gate, leading him forward. Over twenty *li*, through narrow bridges and winding paths, he did not stumble once. Upon reaching home, the torch vanished. The villagers were astonished.\n\nOutside the gate of the Temple of the True Lord, Envoy of the Nine Heavens, on Mount Lu, lay a stone smooth as polished jade, gleaming and immaculate. Those who gazed upon it often witnessed its numinous power. Anyone who defiled the temple would be seized by the spirit officials and beaten beside the stone. Once, a young servant from a scholar’s lodging nearby played upon the stone, sitting and even urinating on it several times. Soon after, a man named Liu Dun filed a complaint with the prefecture, accusing the boy. The prefect sent men to the temple to investigate, but they found only evidence of the boy’s mischief—no trace of Liu Dun’s residence before the temple. A Daoist master named Mao, lodging at the temple, mentioned that a certain official named Liu Dun had recently stayed there, describing him as refined and learned in antiquity. Though Mao had visited him, he knew not where he lived. \"He claimed the boy sat on his head and urinated on him,\" Mao mused. \"Perhaps it was this stone.\" They dug beneath it, and after three or four *chi*, uncovered a vast stone root. All marveled at its strangeness. A small pavilion was built, its windows screened with gauze to keep the stone pristine.\n\nYongqing County in Fangzhou lay a hundred and twenty *li* east of the prefectural seat, a mountainous and ruined district where the city walls stood desolate. During the reign of Emperor Muzong, Magistrate Sun arrived from the capital to take office. A year later, his younger brother Ning came to visit. Upon seeing the desolation, he was overcome with sorrow.\n\nOne leisurely day, he surveyed the four quarters of the county, finding nothing but brambles and thorns. He came upon a desolate temple, its earthen idols arrayed in rows—a central deity seated, three women attending at his side. No gate, no plaque, no inscription revealed whose shrine it was. He inquired of the county officials, who replied only, \"The Great King of Yongqing.\"\n\nHis brother lingered there for a long while, unable to dispel his melancholy. He composed a poem on the wall, a plea and a lament. Soon after, he fell into a deep slumber and found himself in the god’s presence.\n\nThe god addressed him: \"My name and deeds have long been obscure. Though I have longed to recount my story, I feared being dismissed as some malevolent specter. Now that you have asked, I may at last express my long-held sincerity and vent my years of pent-up grievance.\n\nI am from Piling. My grandfather, Ziyin, was a great general, his deeds recorded in the annals of Wu. The general slew the tiger of Nanshan and beheaded the dragon of Changqiao, ridding the people of harm—his hidden merits shone brightly.\n\nI, too, harbored grand ambitions, seeking to serve the age with my deeds. My name is Kuopu. By the Mandate of the Supreme Emperor, I was tasked with the four commanderies of Jinshang and Junfang. Fierce beasts had wrought havoc among the people, cutting off fishing and woodcutting, severing roads and paths. Within a few years, I exterminated countless ferocious tigers, and the people lived in peace once more.\n\nThe chief of the tigers dwelled in Xicheng Commandery. His form was mighty, his movements swift and extraordinary. His body was like white brocade, his brow marked with a mirrored pattern, its light shimmering. He had claimed the most lives. I, too, slew him, wiping out his kind. The people, grateful, built this temple in my honor.\"\n\nFrom the north of Xiang and Han to the south of Lan Pass, temples shaped in my likeness stand in over thirty places. This temple’s image, too, is but one of the many where I once rested. Over the years, the rites have endured, yet folk tradition has erred grievously, mistaking my shrine for that of the White Tiger Spirit. How far from the truth!\n\nFortunately, you, sir, have inquired and allowed me to recount the beginning and end, that I may make plain the facts and correct the falsehood. One day, when your younger brother speaks of this in Xiang, let the guests and retainers compile and inscribe the truth upon tablets in the temple. Dust and rain have worn away the characters, nearly erasing them. In the *Dazhong* year of *Renshen*, Wang Shicheng, the *Guanfeng* Judicial Officer of Xiangzhou, oversaw the subordinate commanderies. Struck by the account, he feared the wooden tablets would decay and errors spread, so he had the text engraved upon stone.\n\nThus, the *Sacrificial Canon* states: \"Those who ward off great disasters, defend against great calamities, and whose merit extends to the people shall be worshipped for generations.\" Lord Zhou inherited his father’s valor and received the Mandate of the Supreme Emperor. Within the four commanderies, his temples stand in abundance—his kindness to the people was vast, and his due offerings are fitting. Yet vulgar custom knows not the truth, mistakenly deeming them shrines to the White Tiger. Had it not been for the poems of Sun Sheng, which stirred the hidden spirit of Kuopu to respond, his divine merit would have remained obscure, and the distinction between true and false lost. Let those who come after read this carefully and take heed.\n\nIn Hezhou’s Bachuan County, after the military upheaval, the official residences lay in ruins. The authorities relocated to a stockade, where they could barely secure themselves. During Magistrate Cui’s tenure, a strong soldier stole and uprooted stockade timber. Captured and sent to the garrison, the commander had him executed. The soldier’s family had long worshipped the Wall Mountain Spirit. After his death, the spirit began to haunt the magistrate’s household. Sometimes it appeared in visible form, coming and going; other times, it cursed from the air, hurled fire and torches, and broke objects. Money, silk, and clothing vanished without cause. Though chests and boxes remained locked as before, the garments inside were often shredded. They sought rituals and exorcisms, but none could subdue it.\n\nWhen the magistrate left office and returned home a thousand *li* away, the haunting followed. Day and night, it ate and drank like a living person. The household served it without rest, expending great effort and wealth, nearly exhausting their resources. Then, one day, the entire family heard the sound of a great crow flapping its wings, descending near the roof and lingering. A voice boomed from the air: \"I have come!\" The whole household, young and old, welcomed and served it. The spirit called itself the Great King.\n\nIt said: \"You have suffered misfortune of late. My brothers from Yong Brook wronged you without cause, ruining your livelihood, destroying your possessions, and causing strange disturbances. I thought you must have feared them greatly—now I have sent them all away. Your misfortune is ended, and fortune begins. The Great King has come to stay, though not for long. For now, I shall rest in the Heavenly Canopy Shrine. This Heavenly Canopy is most excellent—I shall borrow it to copy a version in the heavens. In three to five days, I will return it.\"\n\nDays later, they placed the Heavenly Canopy high upon the eaves, and it remained undamaged. From then on, the spirit was often present, sometimes summoning the master of the house to converse. Suddenly, it would order the young and old to recite poetry or perform music, and they could sing along to every tune. If they misread a character in the text, it would correct them. In conversation, it often urged people to do good, to cultivate *qi* techniques and the Dao. It also claimed to ride a crane to and from the heavens as usual.\n\nAt first, a flock of cranes appeared in the town. The spirit said: \"Only two among them are true cranes—the ones I ride. The rest are common crows.\" It also revealed its surname was Zhang and ate and drank like a living person. It had a daughter named Brocade Maiden, as well as a wife and servants, consuming no small amount of food. Generally, it would speak to good and virtuous people but refused to engage with the violent or wicked. It also mentioned: \"When I go to heaven, three drunken monks and soldiers once came to visit, speaking coarsely and insulting me. I ignored them. After the monk left, I told the household: 'That monk eats dog meat, drinks wine, and is violent and immoral. I did not wish to speak with him.'\"\n\nYet it knew clearly the good and evil deeds of people, their fortunes and misfortunes, blessings and calamities, and its words never missed the mark. It even knew their names and actions in detail. If questioned closely, it would deflect with other answers. What manner of spirit it was remains unknown.\n\nIn the early *Yongping* era, there was a monk named Huijin of the Wang clan who resided at Fugan Temple. One morning, as he left for Zifu Monastery, he saw a tall figure with an indigo-colored body pursuing him relentlessly. He fled to escape, reaching Bamboo Basket Bridge, where he dashed into a civilian’s home. The figure followed, seizing and dragging him with irresistible force. The monk wailed and pleaded. The figure asked: \"What is your surname?\" The monk replied: \"Wang.\" The figure said: \"Same surname, different given name,\" and released him.\n\nTrembling, the monk took refuge in the household. After some time, he calmed and returned to the temple. That very night, another man with the same surname but a different given name died.\n\n*Record of Marvels*, Volume Four—end.\n*Record of Marvels*, Volume Five.\n\nThe Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, President of the Board of Revenue in the Department of State Affairs, Lord of Broad Achievement, Pillar of State, Duke of Cai, Minister Du Guangting, records:\n\nThe Dragon Sea Dragon King’s Residence lies east of Suzhou, a five- or six-day journey into the sea, before a small island. The waters span over a hundred *li*, turbid on all sides. Yet here the water remains clear, and though no wind stirs, waves rise several *zhang* high, so that boats dare not approach. Only when the great tide floods over it, submerging the waves from sight, may vessels pass safely. From afar at night, one sees upon these waters a crimson radiance like the sun, stretching over a hundred *li*, its upper edge touching the heavens. Sailors pass down the tale that the Dragon King’s palace lies beneath.\n\nLiu Zihua, during the Tang dynasty, served as magistrate of Chengdu. One day at noon, a carriage drawn by oxen, flanked by female riders before and behind, entered the hall directly. A messenger announced to Liu: “The Dragon Princess approaches.” Soon she alighted, attended by her retinue, and ascended the steps to meet Zihua. She declared: “By fate’s decree, I am destined to be your mate.” She then remained, ordering wine and music, and after completing the rites in solemn joy, departed. Thereafter, her visits became customary, known far and wide. When Zihua’s term of office ended, her whereabouts became unknown.\n\nThe common saying goes: \"To enter the Dragon Palace is to attain the rank of Water Immortal.\"\n\nLiu Junqing, styled Sun, served as a military aide (*yaya*) in Qingcheng Garrison during the *Qianfu* era. The regional commander was deeply devoted to virtue, often administering medicine and stone needles to cure the ailments of the poor. He personally attended to them, comforting and tending to both soldiers and common folk with tireless diligence. Diligent in his duties and sincere in his dealings, he was held in high esteem by his contemporaries. He possessed a pearl, large as a ball, said to have been passed down by his ancestors through generations as a treasured heirloom. When held to the light, it revealed the forms of objects in perfect detail—every hair and hue clearly visible—though all appeared inverted.\n\nAt that time, the rebel leader Han Zhu of Jinyuan seized Qingcheng and its surrounding market towns. Liu, as garrison commander, led his troops to relieve Taobu Garrison but was encircled by the rebels. Though his thirty-odd elite soldiers fought against hundreds, their strength was unequal. As defeat loomed, a dozen or so infantrymen shielded Liu and attempted to break through the siege, but to no avail. He perished at the hands of the rebels, and all who heard of it grieved deeply.\n\nIn Dangyang County of Jingzhou, a mountain leans over a ravine, within which lies the well of Liu Wenlong, exceedingly deep. A dragon’s lair lies within, its side passages extending an unknown distance. Before fair weather or rain, clouds and mist often rise from the well. During the *Guanghua* era, a Daoist claiming to hail from Mount Shang entered the well to retrieve dragon’s lair soil and medicinal herbs before departing.\n\nLater, a magistrate named Huang Xun took office. He frequently rode his horse near the well, allowing filth and waste to flow into it. When reproached, he offered excuses. Within a year, both he and his horse went blind.\n\nIn the *Gengwu* year of Shu, Wang Zonglang, Prefect of Jinzhou, memorialized: \"By the Xun River in Xunyang County stands the Temple of Azure Mist. For several days, smoke and clouds shrouded its roof in gloom, and music resounded day and night. Suddenly, one day, the waters surged, and a host of dragons emerged upon the surface, moving toward the Han River. The largest measured several *zhang*, the smallest over a *zhang*. Some were yellow, others black, red, white, or green—some resembling oxen, horses, donkeys, or sheep. Fifty in all, they advanced in ranks into the Han River, then circled back toward the temple, weaving in and out of sight for several *li* before vanishing after three days.\"\n\nIn the *Guiyou* year, in the fields of Xipu, a small dragon, dark green in color, was split in two. Within ten days, it rotted and disappeared.\n\nMoha Pond, west of the grand hall, also contains a dragon well. It is highly sacred, and none dare offend it. Within an ancient well in the Chengdu Academy’s Wuhou Residence, south of the Smoky Terrace, fish six or seven *cun* long often swim near the surface, causing the water to surge. It is said the well harbors a dragon.\n\nIn Yihu, at the border of Jianmen, Yichang, and Jiaguan along the Jialing River in Jianzhou, a woman of fifty appeared. She called herself the Eighteenth Aunt and frequently visited households, though she neither ate nor drank. She often admonished people: \"Do only good deeds, never defy the principles of the gods. Harmony at home and filial piety are paramount. Those who do evil, I will send three or five cats to watch over you.\" With these words, she would depart, sometimes vanishing abruptly.\n\nEach year, she appears three to five times to those who encounter her. The people, recognizing her as a tiger transformed, both revere and fear her.\n\nThe Jiyang district lies thirty *li* south of Fuzhou along the You and Qian Rivers. There stands an image hall, its ancient stele still intact, surrounded by abundant property—none dare violate it. A certain Lan Tingyong, a subordinate general of Fuzhou, had a sister who passed through Huazhong and stole an item from the temple’s common holdings. Soon after, she lost her way, and within days, her body transformed into a tiger. Upon her forelegs, the silver-wrapped golden bracelets she once wore remained clearly visible. Whenever she saw villagers, she would speak to them from behind a tree, saying: *\"I stole from Huazhong and was changed into this form. I beg you to see my mother and tell her of my plight.\"* Her mother, terrified, dared not approach. The tiger lingered near the outskirts of the city for a year before gradually departing.\n\n**The Strange Turtle**\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Ming, a Daoist adept once presented a small turtle, barely an inch in diameter, its golden hue radiant and lovely. The adept claimed: *\"This turtle is spiritually enlightened and requires no sustenance. Keep it in your pillow case or box to ward off the venom of great serpents.\"* The emperor often stored it in his headwear chest. Later, a young eunuch, though deeply favored, became entangled in a family scandal. Banishment to the southern frontier loomed, yet the emperor, unwilling to bend the law for clemency, secretly entrusted him with the turtle. He instructed: *\"The southern wilds teem with monstrous pythons. Keep this turtle by your side, and you shall suffer no harm.\"* The eunuch bowed, received it, and carried it close. When he reached the towns and markets of Xiang Prefecture’s outlying districts, all was eerily silent—no soul remained.\n\nThe eunuch sought lodging at an inn, where fodder for beasts and candles for light were provided—nothing was lacking in the accommodations. That night, the moon shone as bright as day, yet the sound of wind and rain arose. The storm drew nearer, so he took out the turtle and placed it upon the steps. After a long while, the divine turtle stretched its neck and exhaled a breath as large as a small boat, rising three or four feet high before slowly dissipating. Soon after, the turtle rested as before, and the sound of wind and rain ceased entirely.\n\nAt dawn, the inn’s attendants gradually arrived, prostrating themselves in the courtyard. They said: *\"Yesterday, we learned that an imperial envoy would pass through and prepared to receive you, but travelers on the road had mistakenly killed a serpent. The others feared vengeance, certain the snake would bring harm that very night. The nearby villagers all fled thirty or fifty li away to escape its poisonous breath. We dared not go far, so we hid in the mountain caves nearby, crouching until daybreak. Now that you, Heaven’s messenger, have come to no harm, it must be the protection of the divine—no human power could have achieved this.\"*\n\nLater, travelers arrived and reported: *\"A dozen or more giant serpents lay rotting on the road. From this day on, no creature remains to seek vengeance—none can fathom the reason.\"* A year later, the eunuch was summoned back to Chang’an and once more presented the golden turtle to the emperor. Weeping in gratitude, he said: *\"Not only was my life preserved by this turtle, but the people of the south have been forever freed from venomous creatures. The lives saved are beyond count—all by Your Majesty’s virtue and the power of this divine turtle.\"*\n\nIn the third year of Wucheng, on the *gengwu* day of the sixth month (the *guihai* day), Meng Yanhui, Governor of Guanghan, memorialized that a golden turtle, an inch in diameter, had been seen swimming upon a lotus leaf in West Lake. He had a painting made and submitted it to the throne.\n\nA merchant moored his boat on the Bian River and caught a giant turtle, which he roasted in the stove’s embers. That evening, he forgot to remove it. The next day, when he went to retrieve it, the shell was already charred. Brushing off the ashes, he placed it on the dining table to serve with his meal. After a long while, the turtle stretched its neck and moved its legs, crawling slowly across the table as if fully alive. All who saw it marveled. He cast it back into the water, where it swam away.\n\nDownstream from Xuanzhou, on the western bank near Caishi Mountain, lies West Liang Mountain, facing East Liang across the water. The residents of West Liang make their living by catching turtles, removing their shells while still alive to sell for pyromantic divination. After stripping the shells, they discard both flesh and carapace into the water—yet the creatures still move. Some say the shells regrow, and they harvest them year after year, supplying an endless market. Yet the turtles of this mountain never seem to diminish. All the divination turtles in the world come from here, though none knows why.\n\nIn the third year of Wude under Emperor Gaozu of Tang, Lord Lao appeared on Yangjiao Mountain. The Prince of Qin sent Ji Shanxing to report the vision. Shanxing told Lord Lao: *\"Entering the capital will be difficult—there must be some proof.\"* Lord Lao replied: *\"On the day you arrive, someone will present a stone resembling a turtle. Let that be your sign.\"* When Shanxing reached the palace gates, indeed, someone from Shaozhou offered a turtle-shaped stone, inscribed on its underside with six characters: *\"The realm at peace, for ten thousand days.\"*\n\nAt the end of the Wude era, when Emperor Taizong quelled the internal strife, a white turtle was seen swimming upon a lotus leaf in the palace pond. Taizong took it in hand, and it transformed into a white stone, lustrous as jade. After ascending the throne, he issued an edict: *\"Heaven, in its favor, bestows upon us this sacred turtle.\"*\n\nIn the *dingmao* year of the Huichang era in Shu, four turtles, each two or three inches long, emerged from a hole in the moat’s embankment near the temple city. Their backs bore golden inscriptions: *\"King\"* and *\"Great Auspice.\"*\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the first year of Qiande under the Shu emperor (*gengchen* day, the birthday of the Broadly Sagely One), Wang Yanhui, the garrison commander of Pengkou Town, presented a white turtle found in the Palace of Master Luo.\n\nIn Changsha County, during the first year of Taishi under Emperor Wu of the Eastern Jin, a divine turtle of dazzling whiteness, four or five *chi* in length, emerged from the water and circled the shore. The pond was thus named *Guītáng* (Turtle Pond), and the fertile fields below it spanned over a hundred *qing*.\n\n---\n\n**Strange Softshell Turtles**\nThe *yuan* resembles the *ao*, but those with red bellies are *yuan*, while white-bellied ones are *ao*. Common lore holds that the *yuan*’s body has twelve segments of flesh. When fishermen catch one, fearing its harm, they pierce it with hooks and sharp blades. Yet even when hacked apart with long-handled axes, its limbs severed and body dismembered, so long as the pieces are not cast into boiling water, they continue to writhe and flee. Even the largest *ao* or *yuan*, if bitten by mosquitoes or gnats, will die within a night.\n\nA man on the Shu River once caught an enormous *ao*, larger than usual, over a *chi* in length, its skirt crimson. He boiled it in a pot, and after a full night, it still swam and played as before. He stoked the fire further, and though the water boiled away, the *ao* did not die. Terrified, the household took it for a dragon’s omen. They cast it back into the river, where it floated away, never to be seen again.\n\n---\n\n**Strange Serpents**\nIn the region of Jianli, there are serpents three *chi* long, as thick as a vat, or at least as stout as a pillar. They have rabbit heads and snake bodies, with white markings beneath their necks. When they seek to harm a person, they emerge from the mountains, rolling downhill to strike travelers, burrowing into their armpits to drink their blood. These are called *bǎn-bí* (Slope-Noses). They hide in burrows, poking out only their snouts to bellow—a sound like an ox’s lowing, audible for miles, shaking the earth. When farmers burn their fields in winter, they sometimes burn these serpents to death, though they yield only fat.\n\nDuring the Qianfu era, at the Divine Immortal Post Station, a giant black serpent, over thirty *zhang* tall, was seen. Accompanying it were hundreds of smaller serpents, some as thick as rafters, others like five- or ten-*dan* jars. They slithered in formation from east to west, a procession of travelers. From dawn until dusk, they passed, their length stretching for miles. As the last of them went by, a small child stood atop the serpent’s tail, waving a red banner and dancing as he went. That year, Yang Shouliang, the military governor of Shannan, was defeated.\n\nIn the South Sea, there is a mountain tens of *li* high, a hundred *li* in circumference. Every summer, a giant serpent coils around it three or four times, drinking from the sea—this is its custom. One day, as it drank, an even larger serpent emerged from the sea and swallowed the fish. The sky darkened, and for a long time, neither was seen again.\n\nThe *Jīguānshé* (Cock’s-Crest Serpent) has a head like a rooster, complete with a comb. Its body is over a *chi* long and several *cun* in girth. Its bite is fatal. It is found at the foot of Mount Kuaiji.\n\nThe *Bàoshēnshé* (Exploding-Body Serpent) is one or two *chi* long, gray as ash. When it hears people passing, it flies from the forest like a withered branch, striking them sideways. Those it hits invariably die.\n\nThe *Huánghànshé* (Yellow-Cheeked Serpent) is one or two *chi* long, golden as yellow metal. It dwells in rock crevices and, when rain is coming, makes a sound like an ox’s bellow. Its bite is also fatal. It is found on Siming Mountain.\n\nIn Pixian County, a villager found a small serpent by the canal on the southern outskirts, over a *chi* long. He gutted it, skewered its body, and roasted it over smoke and fire. Days later, his young child suddenly swelled red all over, its skin blistering and bursting. The child wailed in agony, then spoke: *\"Your family killed me without cause, disemboweling me and roasting me over fire. Now let your child know this pain.\"* The family, horrified, retrieved the serpent’s remains, removed the bamboo skewer, sprinkled them with water, burned incense, and prayed in apology. They returned the remains to the place where it had been found.\n\nAfter a long while, the serpent slithered away, and the villager’s child fully recovered.\n\n**Strange Fish**\nIn the Southern Sea stands a mountain thousands of *chi* tall. Two mountains lie over ten *li* apart, yet when giant fish fight between them, their crests and manes cling halfway up the slopes, and the mountains themselves crumble and break.\n\nIn Pixian County, a man named Hou Sheng found a *chan* fish by the side of a retting pond, its girth nearly a *chi* across. He boiled and ate it, and his white hair turned black again, his fallen teeth regrew, and from then on he felt light and strong.\n\nIn the first year of the Tianfu era, Feng Xingxi, the Attendant Gentleman, governed Xunyang County in Jinzhou. Wu Junhuai, a commoner from Yongnan Township, was gathering herbs by the Lemo Pool on the Han River when he caught a fish several *chi* long. On its body were inscribed words: *\"Thrice I crossed the sea, twice I ascended the Han. Arriving at Lemo, my fate now rests with Master Wu.\"* After the former presented scholar Cui Daoji passed the imperial examination, he traveled through the Jiang-Huai region. One day, deeply drunk, he lay down in an inn. His servant drew water from the well, and a fish came up with the bucket. The servant caught it and told Daoji, who rejoiced: *\"Fish broth sobers one well—cook it at once.\"* After eating, some time passed, then a messenger in yellow robes descended from the sky and stood in the courtyard, calling out for Daoji and ordering men to seize him. A decree was proclaimed: *\"Cui Daoji, a petty mortal of the lower world, dared to kill a dragon’s son. Though you were fated to become chief minister and live to seventy, both shall now be revoked.\"* With that, he ascended back to heaven. That very night, Daoji died suddenly at the age of thirty-five.\n\nThe *chang* fish resembles the common carp in form, its scales marked with red spots. Those over a foot long are found in the Yu-zhang region, often dwelling in muddy pools. Sometimes numbering in the hundreds, they possess the power to conjure illusions and bewitching apparitions, and can even enchant people. The fields near their filthy pools are left untouched by locals. If one offers sacrifices and pays generous rent, the land will yield abundant harvests. Yet the tenant must conceal their name, farming for three years before departing—only then will they avoid harm. Should these fish afflict someone, they can twist faces, invert limbs, and only relent after prayers and offerings. They also traverse land at night, leaving muddy tracks where they pass, and their presence is marked by a hissing sound.\n\nThe Twenty-Five Generals of the Northern Emperor possess the *Poquan Kui* talisman. When inscribed on brick or stone and cast into the pool—or written on a board and nailed to the bank—the fish will flee to another place, but only amid wind, rain, and thunder. Only those skilled in this art may perform it.\n\nThe *houting* fish bears tiger-like stripes. Common lore holds that it cannot be fully cooked, and those who eat it will surely die. Wu of Raozhou, a man of great wealth whose wife’s family was also prosperous, enjoyed marital harmony without the slightest discord.\n\nOne day, Wu returned home drunk and collapsed onto the bed. His wife adjusted his clothes and removed his shoes, lifting his feet onto the bed. As the drunken man thrashed about, he struck his wife’s chest by accident—she gasped and died. Unaware of what had happened, Wu was soon overpowered by his wife’s family, who accused him of beating her to death. The lawsuit dragged on for years, with neither the prefecture nor the commandery able to resolve it. The case was escalated to the imperial court, and Wu was shackled and imprisoned, awaiting his fate.\n\nWu’s own family, fearing that the imperial decree would bring a public execution and disgrace upon their entire clan, bribed the jailers to feed him *houting* fish, hoping he would die in prison. Wu ate the fish without harm—this happened several times, yet he suffered no ill effects. Instead, he grew even more vigorous. Soon after, an amnesty was declared, and he was released. Upon returning home, his descendants flourished, and he lived to eighty before dying of old age.\n\nThough the fish was said to be inedible when cooked and capable of killing those who ate it, he consumed it raw several times without harm. Was this a matter of fate?\n\n*Record of Anomalies, Scroll Five—end*\n*Record of Anomalies, Scroll Six*\n\nLord Guangcheng, Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, President of the Ministry of Revenue in the Department of State Affairs, and Duke of Cai, the Minister of Works and Pillar of State Du Guangting, records:\n\nIn the north of Fuping County, Chang’an, lies Dingling. Beyond it, past the Tongguan Township and more than twenty *li* into the valley, there are two caves: one called the Eastern Women’s Study, the other the Western Women’s Study.\n\nThe Eastern Women’s Study is set in sheer cliffs, its entrance high upon the rock face, unreachable by climbing. At night, the sound of reading often drifts from within.\n\nThe Western Women’s Study is accessible by a path winding along the mountainside. Near its entrance stands a stone chamber, large enough to hold ten or twenty people. The cave mouth is sometimes occupied by figures holding torches, and one may enter. After traveling ten or twenty *li*, the passage splits into five doors on either side, each bearing inscriptions. Some lead to Penglai and other immortal realms.\n\nIn recent years, a rockfall has blocked the entrance, preventing entry.\n\nAtop the mountain is a sky-well, plunging straight down some two *zhang*. A natural stone slab juts out from its side, and beneath it, the well extends another two *zhang* or more, allowing passage. At the bottom, a niche with winding steps ascends broadly. Inside the niche lie tens of thousands of Daoist scriptures, all stored on beds of catalpa wood. A stone figure sits there, head bowed, hands resting on its knees, lifelike in appearance.\n\nAt the bottom of the sky-well lie countless bamboo slips, cast down by Daoist adepts—rotted and piled beyond counting.\n\nDuring the *Dashun* era, a Daoist practitioner from Fuping named Xu the Seventh once retrieved the *Scripture on Nurturing Life* from the cave and disseminated it. Later, a copy was returned to the mountain.\n\nProceeding north another twenty *li* or so, three springs emerge in the valley. A stone ledge there can shelter two or three hundred people. Within the valley lie three stone basins, each over a *zhang* wide, their surfaces smooth and unmarred by human craft. The basins brim with water from the springs, the excess flowing beyond the mountain.\n\nElders say immortals once bathed in these basins. Most who trespass upon this mountain are struck by thunder and hail, damaging crops. Thus, locals conceal their tracks, making the site difficult to find.\n\nThe mountain abounds with traces of immortals and contests of sagely power. Before the Eastern Women’s Study stands a nest of divine roc, guarding the cave entrance. Those who intrude are struck down by the roc, perishing instantly.\n\nLong ago, a Daoist adept carved five stone figures and placed them on the mountain. A farmer hoeing his crops was startled by the roc and fled beneath one of the stone figures, placing his bamboo hat upon its head. The roc struck the hat, breaking the stone figure’s head—its remains are still visible today.\n\nBelow the mountain, in Tongguan Township, many bear the surname Gongsun. On Jiashan, in Shibao Village, most are surnamed Wen or Ma.\n\nThe Maigu Cave on Fanyang Mountain is also known as the First Yangping of the Twenty-Four Transformations. It lies on the sunny side of the Fan River, from which it takes its name.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Original Boundary* states that Celestial Master Zhang Daoling once traveled here, and the Most High preached scriptures in this place. It is located south of Xindu County in Chengdu Prefecture, fifteen *li* across the river, where a range of mountains culminates in a solitary peak.\n\nDuring the *Guanghua* era, in the second year, the *jichou* day of the fifth month (5 June 899), as Emperor Zhenwu was ascending the dragon, the mountain’s earth crumbled, and the cave entrance opened of its own accord. Yang Jing, an official from Shikang Township, and the Daoist Zhang Shouzhen reported the matter to the prefecture, stating that after the cave opened, villagers came and went daily.\n\nThe prefecture dispatched the county clerk Yang Ze, the painter Ren Cong, and Zhang Shouzhen to inspect and map the site. Their report described entering the cave with torches:\n\nThe first door faces north, two *chi* high and three *chi* five *cun* wide. Proceeding to the second door, about five *chi* in, the second cave entrance measures one *chi* six *cun* square. Beyond lies darkness. The passage is one *zhang* two *chi* long and six *chi* wide, with two stone niches on the eastern side and two cave entrances to the southwest.\n\nOne southern passage is one *chi* six *cun* in diameter. Inside, it extends one *zhang* two *chi* long, one *zhang* wide, and four *chi* high, with three stone niches on the southern side.\n\nThe two western passages lead to connecting doors, each one *zhang* seven *chi* in diameter. Inside, they are five *chi* wide and six *chi* high, with a *zhang* between the doors. There is a chamber five *chi* high and four *chi* wide.\n\nWithin, stone carvings of *dou* and *gong* brackets, tiles, and bowls are arranged like a mountain. The characters for \"sun\" and \"moon\" are inscribed, along with a partitioned room one *chi* five *cun* high and two *chi* five *cun* wide.\n\nA stone *ao* (mythical turtle) stands one *chi* high and one *chi* five *cun* wide, with a door five *cun* wide. Three stone niches, each seven *chi* wide, are present.\n\nFurther west, a cave entrance one *chi* seven *cun* in diameter bends toward the southern door. A chamber six *chi* high and four *chi* wide lies beyond. Inside, stone *dou* and *gong* brackets, tiles, and two *ao* models share a bed one *chi* high and two *chi* three *cun* wide. The door is eight *chi* wide, with stone *dou* brackets.\n\nIn the northwest corner is another door, one *chi* six *cun* square. Inside, the space measures two *zhang* or more, with niches on the southern, western, and northern sides. In the southern corner, another cave entrance, one *chi* six *cun* in diameter, emits black vapor when approached with a torch, extinguishing the flame and preventing further entry.\n\nThe cave connects to the main Fanyang Mountain, about three *li* distant.\n\nAccording to a petition from the local villagers, including Zhang Zan of the Zhang clan, Fanyang is an ancient site. The mountain is regularly propitiated with sacrifices, and the cave has existed since antiquity, though it often seals itself. During the *Yuanhe* era, when Wei Gao, Prince of Nankang, was governing Shu, the cave suddenly opened. The people all said: \"When the cave door opens, the year will be abundant and goods plentiful.\"\n\nThe cave then sealed itself again, only to reopen at this time. Thereafter, the years were indeed abundant far and near.\n\nOriginally named Magu Cave, beside the mountain lie the foundations of Magu’s dwelling—where she once cultivated the Dao. The later prefectural seat of Kaizhou leans against Sheng Mountain and rests eastward upon the Qing River. Following the river northward over thirty *li*, one reaches the Warm Springs Well, where hot springs rise from the northern mountainside.\n\nIn the *Linde* era, a thunderous storm split the mountainside with lightning, and the cave entrance opened of itself. Before the entrance stands a stone bell, naturally formed in the shape of a bell weighing several thousand *jin*, suspended with its body some two *chi* above the ground. Though it resembles a bell in outward appearance, it is solid within, and when struck, produces no sound. On either side of the entrance, stones take the form of several *vajra*-guardians.\n\nBeside the bell runs a narrow path, some six *chi* in height. After proceeding two or three *zhang*, the space gradually widens, revealing a stone stele borne by a colossal tortoise, naturally formed, though bearing no inscription. Beside the stele stands a towering screen, its upper part connected to a tripod. Below it lies an opening through which one may enter sideways, one or two *chi* in width, beyond which the space expands.\n\nWithin, a path runs straight and level, no different from an ordinary road. On either side of the path...\n\nDripping stalactites form stone, arrayed in countless shapes—dragons with scaled ridges, phoenixes and cranes, crumbling clouds and towering peaks—some like forests, some like pillars, some seeming to stir, some to leap, now poised for flight, now glancing back, a thousand forms in ten thousand postures, beyond enumeration.\n\nAfter roughly one *li*, a lotus dais rises beside the path, several paces in circumference and three or four *zhang* in height, its tiers stacked in layers, all climbable. Stalactites coil upward like arms or fingers; when illuminated by torchlight, they gleam translucent, snapping brittle at the slightest bend.\n\nEmerging from the cave mouth, all is transformed by the wind into white stone.\n\nThirty or forty paces from the dais, lotus blossoms carpet the ground in every direction. Nearby flows a sweet spring, its waters warm and pale; those who explore the cave brew tea here. Ahead lies a transverse stream, its rapids swift and roaring, rushing out beyond the cave. Over the stream spans a bridge, some two or three *zhang* long and a *zhang* wide, neither of stone nor earth, yet of grand and sturdy craftsmanship.\n\nCrossing the bridge, one reaches a yellow earthen slope, four or five *zhang* high, its path treacherous and slick; travelers pause to catch their breath before reaching the summit. Atop the slope stands a vast hall, its four walls smooth and level, its center soaring several *zhang* high. On the walls, visitors have inscribed their names and the dates of their journeys. At the farthest corner of the hall, a recess appears, four or five *chi* high and three or four *chi* wide, suspended over a *zhang*-deep drop, beyond reach of climbers.\n\nLegend tells of a traveler who once scaled the green vines to enter; after months, he emerged in the caves of Mount Wu. Since then, none have dared follow.\n\nSeventy *li* west of Qifu lies Longzhou, where the Fish-Dragon Cave may be found. Within, stones of varying sizes drift out with the water. When split open, each contains the shape of a fish or dragon. Those who pass before the cave dare not speak; should one utter a word, the sound of wind and thunder instantly arises, striking terror and sending them fleeing—though others hear nothing.\n\nIn Changming County of Sizhou, Mount Doutu is the place where the Perfected One, Dou Ziming, cultivated the Dao. To the west, long ridges still allow passage for carts and horses; to the east, sheer cliffs cut off a corner of the mountain. From the western wall to the eastern peak, the stone grins like a diagram. The two cliffs stand apart by over a hundred *zhang*, their ascent perilous and inaccessible to all.\n\nAtop the peak stand the Heavenly Worthy and an ancient palace, their dates of construction unknown. Immortal adepts once strung a rope bridge to traverse it, but the cables have long since rotted away with the passage of years. A local saying goes: *\"He who would repair and renew it will find hair growing beneath his feet.\"* Such has been the tradition for ages.\n\nDuring the Xiantong era, a Daoist named Mao Yihuan, a native of the mountain’s foothills, took up the Way in his youth. He ceaselessly recited the *Five Thousand Characters*, wore tattered hempen robes, and daily chanted scriptures in the marketplace, begging for wine before ascending the mountain in a drunken state. Scaling sheer cliffs and perilous heights, he treated the impassable as a bridge. At the summit, many white pines grew; he bound them with ropes, stretching them across the peak, and laid planks upon the cables. Men and women who dared to look followed him across.\n\nMidway across, the bridge swayed and threatened to plunge into the abyss below—its depths unfathomable, none dared look down. After several years, the ropes rotted and the bridge collapsed, with no one to repair it.\n\nIn the *renchen* year of the Xiantong era, while performing a mountain sacrifice with guests on the western peak, Mao the Master was away on his travels. Someone told the magistrate: \"Beside this peak lies a narrow path, clinging to the cliffside, barely passable—no handholds for travelers. Yet Master Mao often ventured there, disappearing for over ten days before reemerging.\" The magistrate suspected he hid in a cave. Among the guests was Guo Toutui of Guangling, whom the magistrate asked to follow the path and investigate. After a long while, Toutui returned, shaken and speechless, then recounted: \"The path extends some thirty *zhang* or more before reaching a cave. Its mouth spans only three to five *chi*; descending, one finds level ground hundreds of *chi* below. The cave can seat over ten people. Inside stands a massive wooden chest, sealed with sturdy locks. This was where Master Mao read his scriptures—the stone surface is smooth, bearing the marks of knees and feet, with scrolls still resting there. But Master Mao himself was nowhere to be found. His household consists only of a wife and daughter, so it is suspected he attained the Dao.\"\n\nMaster Mao often carried a bowl with a lamp to cross the rope bridge. The mountain’s residents grew accustomed to the sight. The mountain teemed with venomous snakes and fierce tigers, so locals never dared venture alone. Yet when Mao returned at night, he showed no fear. Two crows always accompanied him; when guests were about to arrive, the crows would take flight and cry out. Mao would then prepare the seating for visitors, and before he finished, the guests would indeed arrive.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the seventh month in the *renzi* year, at Ghost City Mountain in Qingcheng, heavy rains caused cliffs to collapse, and a sudden torrent surged forth behind the Temple of the Venerable One, rising over a hundred *zhang* high. The temple hall stood directly in its path, threatened with destruction. Suddenly, a boulder fell like a dam, diverting the water eastward and sparing the hall from ruin. The temple had long relied on fetching water from the stream for daily use, a laborious task. From the source of the flood, a spring now flowed directly into the kitchen, its water sweet and fragrant, never ceasing in winter or summer.\n\nEast Pillar and West Pillar lie north of Jinzhou and south of Qianyuan, over sixty *li* away. The name derives from the connected mountains, their peaks striking and unusual. Locals say: \"A mountain comes from the south, and to its north stands a massive stone pillar. The mountain passes through the pillar, hence the name.\" Further east rise several sheer peaks, one towering above the rest, said to be where Master Pu ascended. Below Master Pu’s peak, near the cliff and in the ravine, lie stone slabs inscribed with seal script—six or seven sites in all. Few can decipher them, though they may still be found.\n\nFlame Sun Cave, as passed down by elders, lies atop Yang Mountain in Lingzhou. Hidden since ancient times, none knew its location. On the sixteenth day of the first month in the third year of the Qiande era (*xinsi* year), during the *gui-mao* night, the Well Inspector, Protector Ma Quanzhang, and the Military Commissioner, Grand Guardian Ma, dreamed of a man clad in purple robes with a sash, his tall hat and ancient attire resembling a Daoist. The man bowed and led them to a cliffside, saying: \"This is Flame Sun Cave. Sealed for many years, if you open and protect it, it will bring fortune to the state.\" He pointed to a nearby path, recently opened, and urged them to block it to prevent commoners from trampling the site. Then he departed.\n\nAt dawn, Quanzhang searched the area and found the earth slightly sunken. Probing with a staff, he discovered depths beyond measure. He ordered Hou Guangzhi, a military officer, to assemble laborers for excavation. Gradually, traces emerged, and as they dug, three stone gates appeared. Inside, only fine sand remained—no insects, no other creatures. The cave ran east to west, twenty-nine *chi* deep and five *chi* three *cun* wide. The entire cave was hewn from stone.\n\nThe first gate stood six *chi* high and five *chi* two *cun* wide. The second gate was five *chi* five *cun* high and three *chi* seven *cun* wide. The third gate measured four *chi* seven *cun* high and three *chi* five *cun* wide. From the third gate inward, the height remained a uniform six *chi* one *cun*. The three gates stood only three to four *chi* apart, their carving so exquisite it seemed beyond human craft.\n\nWithin the third gate, on the southern side, was a stone chamber seven *chi* four *cun* wide, four *chi* eight *cun* high, and four *chi* two *cun* deep. Behind it lay another small cave, its entrance concealed by a slab of stone. A narrow crevice allowed light to reveal depths unknown. On the northern side was another chamber, four *chi* two *cun* deep, seven *chi* three *cun* wide, and five *chi* high, containing a stone bed. A smaller western chamber measured two *chi* deep, three *chi* five *cun* wide, and three *chi* one *cun* high. The northwestern stone bed was three *chi* eight *cun* long and two *chi* eight *cun* wide. A stone stove in the northwest corner spanned two *chi* three *cun* in length, with a seven-*cun* lintel. The stove was eight *cun* deep and three *chi* five *cun* in circumference.\n\nFrom the cave’s entrance eastward to the sacred well, the distance measured forty-one *zhang* eight *chi*. The cave’s entrance faced due east.\n\nDu Zhangzhao summoned the supervisor of the sacred well, the chief Daoist master of the Heavenly Master’s Institute, and the eminent *daode* priest Fei Shengzhen for consultation. They stated: \"The Heavenly Master’s Institute currently possesses the *Stele of the Heavenly Master’s Sacred Virtue*, inscribed by Prefect Li Zhengqing during the Yuanhe era, which records: 'In the second year of Jian’an of the Eastern Han, Heavenly Master Zhang journeyed from Pei to Shu, determining Qian as its astrological division. Observing the *qi* and appearance of Yang Mountain, he pointed to his disciples and said: Beneath this mountain lies a salt spring.' Now, upon examining this cave, we find it precisely above the well—this is indeed the Flame-Yang Cave.\"\n\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll Six, compiled by Minister of Works, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, and Duke of Cai, the臣 Du Guangting.\n\n**Strange Waters**\n\n**Yiyang County** lies within the borders of Changsha Prefecture. Established during the Qin dynasty, its name remains unchanged to this day. The *Treatise on Geography* states: \"The Yi River flows along its southern side,\" though its existence is now unrecorded. To the north, it borders the Kui River, whose source lies in the boundaries of Shaoling and Wugang Counties, flowing northeast into Dongting County. Gazing eastward, one may at times discern the city walls of Changsha, along with the forms and colors of people and horses, all distinctly visible. Whether at dawn or midday, the vision lingers for hours before gradually fading. Though the county lies a direct three hundred *li* from Changsha, separated by towering mountains, and thus logically beyond sight, could this be the numinous manifestation of mountains and spirits? A local saying goes: \"Changsha and Yiyang, sealed in the same moment.\" In the first year of Zhongyuan during the reign of Emperor Guangwu, when he sealed Mount Tai and performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices at Liangfu, the mountain spirits manifested palaces on that very day. When the First Emperor of Qin dispatched the fangshi Xu Fu to sail the seas in search of elixirs, he glimpsed amid the waves the foundations of Han palaces and towers, their forms vivid and distinct, complete with the estates of nobles and officials. When Ban Chao resided in Hunye, at dawn amid radiant clouds, he saw celestial palaces arrayed in the distance, with attendants and ministers—all in the style of the Han. Such phenomena defy precise explanation.\n\nOne hundred and twenty *li* west of Xinkang County lies Qingtan, a deep pool in Zhangpu Stream, where a white dragon is said to dwell. During droughts, locals cast sheep dung into the pool, and soon after, torrential rains and floods arise—an effect still witnessed today.\n\nAt the head of the Qiantang River’s tide, when Wu Zixu repeatedly remonstrated with the King of Wu and was executed for defying his decree, he was dismembered by sword before death. His final words to his son were: \"Hang my head at the southern gate to witness the arrival of Yue’s armies. Wrap my body in fish skin and cast it into the river, so that I may ride the tides morning and evening to witness Wu’s downfall.\" Since then, the tide surges from Haimen Mountain, rising hundreds of feet high, crossing Qiantang and passing Yupu before gradually subsiding. It comes twice daily, its roar thunderous, like lightning and galloping horses, audible for over a hundred *li*. At times, Zixu is seen riding a white horse and a plain carriage amid the tide, prompting the construction of a temple in his honor. On the banks of the Sha River within Luzhou City stands another temple to Zixu. Each morning and evening, when the tide rises, the river’s waters surge and swell, reaching a height of one *chi* and a width of over ten *zhang* before the temple, subsiding after the time it takes to eat a meal. The locals say it responds to the Qiantang tide.\n\nDuring the Jinglong era of Emperor Zhongzong, along the four hundred *li* of official roads west of Luoyang, the land appeared as a watery reflection. People, horses, and trees were visible as if standing upon it, their shadows clear enough to view from above. The phenomenon lasted over a month before vanishing.\n\nBeneath Zhaotan Mountain lies a frigid spring, its depths unfathomable, known as Zhaotan. A proverb says: \"Zhaotan has no bottom; Orange Isle floats above.\" Long ago, a man capsized here, sinking his copper pot, which bore an inscription. Later, it was recovered in Dongting Lake, suggesting an underground passage connects them. Within the Xiang River’s embrace lies a stone bed, upon which rests a stone coffin with a seamless lid, its color like polished bronze—its origins unknown.\n\nSeventy *li* southwest of Mount Lu stands Yongquan Abbey. Long ago, the Supreme Perfected Immortal Ge Xuan refined elixirs here, and in response, a spring gushed from a stone crevice, flowing over a hundred *li* into Xunyang Lake, irrigating vast fields. The area was once plagued by leeches, tormenting farmers, until the Immortal inscribed a talisman beneath the cave’s entrance. When water washed over it, the leech infestation vanished wherever the water flowed, benefiting nearby and distant lands alike. Later, the talisman was carved and moved to Yongquan Abbey, though its original site remains, its efficacy undiminished.\n\nIn Chizhou Prefecture, the Red River harbors a surging spring, its five or six veins welling from the mountainside to form a great pool. Flowing two or three hundred paces, it cascades over rocky steps into a vast stream.\n\nThe Medicinal Spring lies forty *li* west of Fangzhou, within the pavilion of the Nine-Chamber Palace. The palace’s grand foundations rest upon a massive boulder, with only the Medicinal Spring—a two-*chi*-wide earthen well—visible. Digging three or four *chi* deep reveals mere inches of water, neither depleting nor overflowing. Elders recount that two magpies once nested upon twin trees, drinking from this spring. Locals who drank its waters found their ailments cured, and blades tempered in it became twice as sharp as usual—hence its name. The twin trees flanking the well still stand today. During the Wei and Zhou dynasties, an imperial decree ordered the construction of palaces here, as the mountain housed nine grottoes of immortals, thus naming it the Nine-Chamber Palace. Five *li* north of the palace lies Tangkou Village, where once stood a hot spring with splendid halls. The people of the prefecture bathed here. When the Prince of Luling governed the region, his young daughter bathed in the spring and perished from an epidemic. Thereafter, the hot spring dried up, leaving only barren land. After the girl’s death, she appeared in a secret dream to her father, saying: \"Beneath the spring lies a dark cavern. I beg you to place a lamp there to illuminate it.\"\n\nThe prince commanded the installation of nine lamps in the dark cavern, illuminating it day and night. Today, they have all vanished, leaving no trace of their former site—only the name Tangkou Village remains.\n\nThirty *li* northwest of Qingcheng County lies the Temple of the Supreme Lord Lao. To the east of its gates, a spring called Horse-Hoof Spring flows. Its water is sweet and never ceases, icy cold in spring and summer, warm in autumn and winter. This was the place where the Supreme Lord Lao and the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign met to commune with the Dao. The spring was formed when the horse ridden by the Supreme Lord stamped its hoof into the earth.\n\nSix-Times Water:\nTwo *li* south of the Zongxuan Temple on Mount Qingcheng, a sheer cliff rises over five hundred *chi*, facing the temple. At its summit lies the Altar of Dao Transmission, where Lord Xiao of the Night once bestowed the Dao upon the Yellow Emperor. At the base of the ravine stands a stone niche. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, a divine effigy was enshrined there, and every day at the six *shi* hours, water would naturally flow from the cliff—an unceasing phenomenon still witnessed by pilgrims today.\n\n**Wondrous Stones**\nDuring the reign of Emperor Yao, five treasures descended from heaven. The first was the essence of earth, which fell at the foot of Gucheng Mountain. It transformed into the Old Man of the Ruined Bridge, who bestowed a military treatise upon Zhang Liang, saying, \"Read this, and you shall become the teacher of emperors and kings. Later, seek me beneath Gucheng Mountain—there, a yellow stone awaits.\" When Zhang Liang aided the Han and his work was done, he searched beneath Gucheng Mountain and indeed found the yellow stone. After Zhang Liang retired to Mount Shang to study the Dao with the Four White-Haired Ones, his family buried his robes and cap alongside the yellow stone. In ancient times, a yellow *qi* was often seen rising from the tomb, towering several *zhang* high. Later, the Red Eyebrows rebels exhumed the grave, but no corpse was found, and the yellow stone had vanished—its *qi* forever extinguished.\n\nThe essence of Jupiter fell upon Mount Jing, where it transformed into jade. Viewed from the side, it appeared green; viewed head-on, it was white. Bian He discovered it and presented it to the King of Chu. Later, it passed into Zhao and was offered to the First Emperor of Qin, who unified the realm and carved it into the Seal of Longevity. Li Si inscribed its surface in small seal script, and it was passed down through the ages as the Imperial Heirloom. Some ancient and modern accounts differ, claiming it was the essence of the Great Horn Star—also known as Jupiter.\n\nThe essence of Mars fell into the South Sea, becoming a great pearl over a *chi* in diameter. At times, it would rise from the waves, its light illuminating hundreds of *li* of sea and sky with a crimson glow. The place is now called Pearl Pond or Pearl Cliff, and the pearl still appears occasionally.\n\nThe essence of Venus fell west of Guifeng Peak on Mount Zhongnan, which is why the mountain is named Mount Taibai. The essence transformed into a white stone, resembling fine jade, often veiled in purple *qi*. During the Tianbao era, Emperor Xuanzong built the Temple of the Mysterious Origin in the Daning Ward of Chang’an, on the site of his former residence in Linzi, intending to commission a statue of the Mysterious Origin. In a dream, a divine being told him: \"In the northern valley of Mount Taibai lies a jade stone—retrieve and carve it. The place where the purple *qi* appears is where it rests.\" The next day, the emperor sent envoys into the valley to search. Locals reported that for ten days, a purple *qi* had lingered, unscattered. They dug at the site and recovered the jade stone, which was carved into a statue of the Mysterious Origin over two *zhang* tall. Two Perfected Ones, two attendants, and likenesses of Li Linfu and Chen Xilie—each over six *chi* in height—were also fashioned.\n\nThe essence of Mercury fell into Willow Valley in Zhangye Commandery, transforming into a black stone over a *zhang* wide and three *chi* high. By the end of the Later Han, faint patterns began to emerge upon it, though they were not yet distinct.\n\nDuring the Qinglong era of the Wei, a sudden thunderclap resounded for over a hundred *li*, and the stone stood upright of its own accord. White patterns emerged upon it, depicting the forms of oxen, horses, immortals, jade rings, and jade *jue*—along with inscriptions. This truly foretold the rise of the Sima clan to the Jin, as a sign of the Metal Virtue.\n\nIn the time of Emperor Yao, when the celestial *qi* was exhausted in the Great Yang and the terrestrial *qi* reached its limit in the Great Yin, the cycle of ninety-six years of Yang had run its course, and the turning of the celestial mandate fell upon the year of *jiashen*. It was a convergence of great calamities, and thus the five planets offered their essence, while the sun and moon cast murky shadows—such were the omens.\n\nIn the summer of the tenth year of Tianfu (Gengwu), at Guanshi in Hongzhou, beneath Mount Yuewang, before the Zhaoxian Temple, a sound like thunder erupted, accompanied by a five-colored radiance spanning ten *zhang*. The boundaries of Yuan, Ji, Jiang, and Hongzhou all witnessed the light and heard the sound. Before the temple, five-colored mists lingered for a month before dispersing. A stone, seven or eight *chi* in length and over three *chi* in circumference, clear and jade-like in hue, fell to the ground. The military governor and Chancellor Liu Wei ordered it carried into the Zhaoxian Temple, where a vegetarian feast was held to offer prayers and thanks. Within seven days, the stone shrank to three *chi* in length. After several more days of feasting, it diminished further to just over a *chi*, and now remains at seven or eight *cun*, preserved within the temple.\n\nFifty *li* south of Jiangzhou lies a shop called Qilidian. South of Shejiang, atop a small hill, stands a stone of green hue, hard and smooth. Local lore claims that within the stone lies a pearl, and every Mid-Autumn Festival, over a dozen of them take flight like shooting stars, gathering and scattering. At times, light shimmers upon the stone, and it is said that the pearls are hidden there—priceless treasures. Some who have witnessed this have secretly marked the spot, only to find nothing upon returning.\n\nLi Tiao, a presented scholar from Kuaiji, once chanced upon a small stone, dark green and flat, warm and smooth to the touch, which he used as a paperweight. A fly alighted upon it and, when shooed away, was found to have turned to stone. Testing it with other insects, they too transformed, their shells hardening and growing heavy, indistinguishable from stone.\n\nIn the mountain pavilion of Yongkang County in Muzhou, a withered pine tree was felled and accidentally fell into water, where it turned to stone. Untransformed portions were tested in the water and likewise petrified. The transformed parts—branches, trunk, and bark—remained identical to pine, save for their hardness. Several untransformed segments were kept as curiosities.\n\nIn the mountains of Changming County in Sizhou, within an area of some twenty *li*, lay countless porcelain incense burners, each about two *cun* wide, some intact, others broken, piled amidst the forest in untold numbers.\n\nIn the wild fields of Jianchang County in Hongzhou, natural stone steles, stone figures, and stone tortoises lay scattered across the earth in great numbers. All bore the appearance of having been carved, yet bore no inscriptions. Most of the stone figures lay face-down, though some stood upright. It was also said that nearby stood a stone well, deep but dry. The curious who entered it with torches found a side passage of unknown length, its walls lined with stone figures.\n\nThe Auspicious Stone Inscriptions of Changsong:\nWhen Li Xiyu served as Governor of Liangzhou, Qin Changsong produced an auspicious stone upon which characters had formed naturally—one hundred and ten in total. The gist read: *\"The High Emperor’s sea bears two characters; Li Nine, King Eight Thousand. The Great Peaceful Son of Heaven, Li Shimin, shall reign a thousand years. The Crown Prince? Governs Yanshan. Every man enters the kingdom. The Lord exalts Wang Kua, rewarding Wen Tong for a thousand generations of greatness. King Five, King Seven, King Ten. Phoenix-plumed talent, Wu Wenzheng of the Zhenguan era. Flourishing the sagely in all directions, governing ten thousand below. Loyalty and filial piety bring goodness.\"* The Court dispatched the Gentleman of the Ministry of Rites, Liu Cheng, to verify the report by post-horse. Finding it true, he memorialized accordingly.\n\nXinbeishi was the former site of the Jingyun Temple.\n\nA massive stone, larger than a pillar’s base, would scorch those who sat or trod upon it—its touch like fire, stirring vexing heat within the heart, often inducing illness and even death. Some claimed that if one gathered fire to burn this stone, the Qutang Mountains would roar and its waters boil, an ancient tale passed down through generations. In the mountain pavilion of Jinyuan County, Shuzhou, stood two great stones, each about two *chi* in diameter, rising seven or eight *cun* from the earth. Those who sat upon them would suffer heart pain, often beyond remedy. These, too, were fallen-star stones: the eastern one brought life and proved efficacious, while the western one brought death. In appearance, they differed not from other stones, their hue a blend of blue and white.\n\nNear the garrison of Zhenjing, by the riverbank’s shallows, lay a stone five or six *chi* long and nearly three *chi* tall. When struck, it rang like a bell. Military commissioner Liu Shijian presented another stone, about four *chi* in length, round in shape and blue in color, which, when struck, resounded like a chime. Along the half-cliff of Linjiang in Wu Commandery, a stone emerged from a landslide. When drummed with a mallet, it produced no sound. Emperor Wu inquired of Zhang Hua, who replied: *\"Carve a fish from paulownia wood from Shu, and strike it—then it shall sing.\"* Following his advice, the sound carried for *li*.\n\nShi Jilong constructed a river bridge at Lingchang Ford, quarrying stones for its central pier. Yet no stone, great or small, remained in place, swept away by the current. Over five million laborers toiled in vain. Jilong dispatched envoys to make offerings, sinking jade disks into the river. Soon after, the submerged jade washed ashore, the earth quaked, and waves surged onto the ford, toppling towers and halls, crushing over a hundred to death.\n\nIn the *Qianfu* era, a monk from Tiantai, journeying east from Mount Tiantai into Linhai County, discovered a cave. With fellow monks of like mind, he ventured inside. For the first ten or twenty *li*, the path was low and narrow, often muddy. Beyond, the terrain gradually leveled and widened, revealing mountains and streams.\n\nAfter another ten *li* or so, they came upon market stalls and dwellings no different from those of the world above. This monk was long practiced in swallowing *qi* and felt neither hunger nor thirst. But his companions, ravenous, approached a food stall to beg for sustenance. Someone warned them: \"If you can endure hunger and thirst, return swiftly and suffer no harm. But should you eat the food of this place, you will surely never leave.\" Yet their hunger was too great, and they insisted on eating. After the meal, they traveled another ten *li* or so, the path growing ever narrower, until they found a small opening and emerged. The monk who had eaten instantly turned to stone.\n\nThe Tiantai monk left the mountain and, encountering a passerby, asked where he was. He found himself already on the shores of Mouping. *Record of Marvels*, Scroll Seven (end).\n\n---\n\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll Eight\n\nThe Guangcheng Master, Grand Pillar of State, Duke of Cai, and Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, the Honorable Du Guangting, Compiler\n\n**Tombs**\n\nChen Prefecture was the ancient domain of Taihao. Within the East Gate City stands the Temple of Fuxi and Nüwa. At its southeastern corner lies the Eight Trigrams Altar, and at its southwestern corner, the \"Sea Eye\"—a hollow formed by the roots of an ancient tree. When objects are dropped straight down, their depth remains unfathomable. In times of drought, casting gold or silver into it may summon rain, for it is also a site where the state offers sacrifices. Beside the hollow stands a Dragon Hall.\n\nOutside the East Gate City lies the tomb of Fuxi, bound with iron to prevent trespass. The locals call it the \"Grandparents' Tomb.\" Though Chen Prefecture is small, bandits and rebels who attack it never prevail, for the tomb’s numinous power protects it.\n\nIn the Shangyong region of Fang Prefecture stands another Temple of Fuxi and Nüwa, said to be where they molded earth to create humanity, its ancient traces still present.\n\nIn the Yellow River, along the border of Hua and Shan Prefectures, lies a small islet with several ancient trees. Though the river swells, it never submerges them, for this is said to be Nüwa’s tomb. During the *Dali* era, days of unrelenting wind and rain, darkness and thunder raged without cease. When the skies cleared, the tomb had vanished, its whereabouts unknown.\n\nA hundred *li* northwest of Cai Prefecture, within Pingyu County, lies the Tomb of the Immortal Maiden—where Dong Zhongshu interred his mother’s robes and cap. Tradition holds that Dong Yong first dwelled on Mount Xuan, and when Zhongshu grew older, he longed for his mother and built this tomb. During the time of Qin Zongquan, some claimed: \"Zhongshu’s mother was a celestial maiden, and no earthly tomb exists. This must be where he concealed divine talismans, elixirs, and the secret arts of yin and yang.\" Zongquan ordered a subordinate general to lead over a hundred soldiers to excavate it. At once, rain poured down for sixty days without pause, and the work could not proceed.\n\nThat year, the Huai and Xi regions suffered agricultural devastation, leading to a great famine.\n\nThe tomb of Emperor Wu of Changsha of the Han lies two *li* east of Changsha County, standing twenty-seven *zhang* high with a circumference of six hundred *zhang*. Long ago, Wu Gang, the chief clerk to Zhuge Dan, was visited by a man who remarked, \"You bear a striking resemblance to Wu Yin.\" Startled, Gang asked, \"How do you know this?\" The visitor replied, \"In the third year of Huangchu, I once traveled to Changsha and saw men excavating Wu Yin’s tomb, where many jade artifacts were found. Yin’s corpse lay stiff, yet his appearance remained unchanged from life—you resemble him closely.\" Gang said, \"He was my seventh-generation ancestor. Since you saw him then, where is the jade now?\" The man answered, \"It was all placed in Sun Jian’s temple.\"\n\nThe tomb of Emperor Ding of Changsha of the Han, along with that of his mother, Lady Tang, each stands thirteen *zhang* high with a circumference of three *li*. The larger tomb rises eighteen *zhang*, and the two are separated by three *zhang*.\n\nSoutheast of Dangtu County in Xuanzhou stands Mount Heng, at whose base lie eight grand tombs. During the Qianfu era, thieves excavated one, uncovering a pit with a rope woven from seventy bolts of silk. A man was lowered to inspect it, but swarms of black bees assailed him. Overwhelmed, he fled in terror, and nothing was retrieved. Local tradition holds this to be the tomb of Governor Tao of Guangzhou, though its occupant’s name and era remain unknown.\n\nBefore the main hall of Hongzhou stood a Chinese honey locust tree, so vast that several men could barely encircle it. Birds dared not perch upon it, and those who trespassed against it met with immediate divine retribution—a phenomenon attested for centuries. In the main hall, official business was never conducted at inauspicious times, a long-standing custom. When Li Xian assumed the governorship, he ordered the tree felled, despite protests from officials and commoners alike. After its removal, thousands of crows gathered, cawing incessantly. Suspecting something beneath, Xian ordered the ground excavated. Several feet down, they uncovered a massive tomb. Inside lay a stone inscription bearing hundreds of cryptic characters, concluding: *\"This is the tomb of Guo Pu. Five hundred years hence, the tomb-raider Li Xian shall appear.\"* The prophecy foretold events yet to come, some of which are still recalled today. Xian then ordered the tomb restored and relocated the hall to avoid its site.\n\nAccording to records, in the first year of Emperor Yuan of the Eastern Jin, Guo Pu was executed by Wang Dun in Jiankang. It remains unclear why his tomb lies in Yuzhang. From the first year of the Eastern Jin (a *dingchou* year) to the reigns of Emperor Wenzong and Emperor Jingzong of the Tang, precisely five hundred years had passed.\n\nWhen Zhong Chuan first entered Hongzhou, he ordered the city walls repaired. Soldiers and officials scattered to gather bricks from old tombs for the construction. Upon completion, Chuan dreamed of a man in archaic robes, his neck elongated and his bearing like that of Zilu, who approached and said, \"General, why have you desecrated my resting place and left me unsettled? Restore it at once.\" Upon waking, Chuan questioned his officers and retainers, but none recognized the figure. Then, an elder named Luo Tong sought an audience and said, \"Old maps record that thirty-one *bu* southeast of the city’s corner lies the tomb of Master Ziyu—a site long said to be spiritually potent. I fear the soldiers may have taken bricks from it, offending its occupant.\" Chuan sent men to investigate, and the account proved true.\n\nHe immediately ordered the tomb to be rebuilt with bricks and adorned, erecting a pavilion atop it to mark the ancient site. Upon completion, the figure appeared in his dreams again to express gratitude. Chuan rewarded Luo Tong with bolts of silk.\n\n**Note:** Zhaitai Mieming, a disciple of Confucius, styled Ziyu, resided in Wucheng. Though his appearance was unremarkable, he was upright and prudent. Wucheng was not part of Yuzhang Commandery—why his tomb should lie here remains unknown.\n\nThe tomb of General Xu Jing stands outside Chengdu’s Yanqiu Gate, seven or eight *li* due west. In the fields rises a great barrow, said to be the general’s resting place. Those who till the land or tend livestock—be it oxen or swine—who trespass upon it invariably meet with misfortune. Though most wild tombs outside the city have been lost, this one alone remains untouched, and none dare violate it. Jing, in the service of Former Shu, rose to the rank of Grand Minister of Works.\n\nIn Shangyu County of Yuezhou, over twenty *li* south of the river, stands Nanbao Temple in Nanbao Village. To reach it, one crosses Heng Ridge. A man fond of exploring landscapes, weary from climbing the ridge, rested beneath a tree where an old villager had also paused. As they spoke of the mountains and rivers, the villager pointed to a tomb by the path and said, “If this tomb belongs to a man, there is nothing to say. But if it is a woman’s, her son shall rise to the rank of the Three Dukes.” The traveler found his words strange and inquired among the temple monks and villagers. One who knew the tale said, “This is the tomb of Zheng Zhu’s mother.”\n\nIn the early Yuanhe era, the temple had a female servant who became involved with a villager named Shi. She bore a son, who by the age of ten was put to work by the monks, fetching water and porridge for a traveling monk surnamed Zheng, who had suffered from dysentery for over a month. The boy’s diligence impressed the monk, who wished to take him as an attendant. The monks said, “His father, Shi, is still alive. We must ask him first.” Shi consented without hesitation. When the abbot questioned him, he agreed again. The monk took the boy away, naming him Zheng after his own surname. He taught the boy medical texts and arts, and the boy later encountered a wandering scholar, mastering various skills. Through connections with nobles and officials, he rose to prominence. In the Dahe era, he received extraordinary favor and was appointed Military Commissioner of Feng Prefecture. Later, he was executed for his crimes—this was Zheng Zhu. After his mother’s death, the temple monks buried her on the ridge, the very tomb the old villager had pointed out.\n\nLi Dao, in the late Xiantong era, served as a judicial officer in Fengxiang Prefecture. While investigating a case of tomb robbery, he questioned the culprits about their exploits. They confessed, “We have been thieves for thirty years. North of Xianyang, east of Mount Qi, and beyond the imperial mausolea, we have opened nearly every ancient tomb.” When asked what they had found, they recounted, “Once, we entered a tomb and descended a sloping passage over thirty *chi* deep to a stone door. When we pried it open, arrows shot out endlessly—over a hundred in all—until they ceased. We then forced the door open. The first thief to enter was struck by a spinning blade and fell dead. Inside, over ten wooden figures whirled swords with the speed of wind, making it impossible to approach. We used a wooden beam to block them, and the mechanism stopped. We removed all the blades, and the figures could no longer move. Inside, we found a chamber with curtains and bedding neatly arranged. A lacquer lamp burned brightly, and wooden mannequins stood in for concubines. Over a *zhang* above the ground hung an iron-bound coffin suspended by chains. When we struck it with a beam, the coffin shifted, and sand poured down like water, impossible to halt. It flooded the chamber and rushed out the door, rising over two *chi* deep. After a long while, the tomb filled with sand, and we could not re-enter. We never learned whose tomb it was.”\n\nAnother tomb stood on the plains of Xianyang. Upon entering, the thieves found two mirrors that could reflect a person’s nose. The reverse sides were polished and gleaming, as if new. When they rubbed the mirrors and looked into the front, their reflections appeared normal. But when they looked into the reverse, their forms were fully visible—clothing and hats in perfect order—yet inverted. Seven *li* northeast of Anzhou lay an ancient tomb, seven or eight *chi* high and several hundred *bu* in circumference. No one knew whose it was. When bandits dug into it, they found it sealed with cast iron, extending over a *zhang* deep with no end in sight.\n\nTwenty *li* east of the city stood a great tomb. Bandits spent days opening it and found over a hundred gold hairpins, each weighing a hundred *jin*, along with stone seats, miscellaneous treasures, and ancient-style belts arranged in abundance. When they took one of the belts, water surged forth, quickly filling the tomb. The opening they had made soon sealed itself. The thieves presented two stone lions to the prefect, Military Commissioner Wu. That night, the prefect dreamed of a man in archaic robes, accompanied by a large retinue, who came to pay his respects, saying, “I am Wu, the Southern Barbarian Minister. Bandits have desecrated my resting place. As you share my surname, I ask that you restore it. Let the thieves go mad, and do not arrest them.” The prefect ordered the tomb repaired. Soon after, over thirty bandits went mad and died one after another.\n\nIn the third year of the Qianning era (896 CE), Li Shitai, Prefect of Shuzhou, Military Advisor to the Commissioner, and Minister of Works, built his residence in Chengdu’s Jinpu Ward, within the North Gate’s western circuit, the first estate on the western side. To its west stood the shrine of Li Bing. North of the estate, the terrain rose gradually, with a ridge extending southwest to meet the shrine. While excavating five or six *chi* deep north of the hall, they uncovered a massive tomb.\n\nThe brick walls were exceptionally sturdy. Outside the bricks, several dozen gold coins were found, each weighing seventeen or eighteen *zhu*, with a diameter of seven or eight *fen*. They were round and perforated, with a two-*fen* greenish patina, and bore raised circular ridges. Within the ridges, on both sides, were twenty-one characters in foreign script. The patina was thin, and the edges were sharp.\n\nThe supervisor hastened to present two of the coins to the Minister of Works, who ordered a messenger to bring them to my mountain retreat in Cloud Creek of Mount Qingcheng. He said: \"Over a *shi* of these coins were unearthed. The Minister has commanded that they be returned to their original place and that the tomb remain unopened—though none know whose grave it is.\"\n\nJudging by the terrain, it must lie a hundred paces south of Stone Bamboo Shoot. The so-called \"Stone Laugh\" is surely the tomb’s spirit tablet. Since then, the site has been imbued with numinous power, and none dare violate it.\n\nLater, the Lord of Shu repurposed the shrine, offering sacrifices to the Dragon Spirit. A small chamber, the Dragon Hall, was erected to the east of the tomb. Minister Li neither disturbed the ancient grave nor coveted the gold coins—his conduct reflects the lofty discernment of the ancients.\n\nHow admirable! How admirable!\n\nIn the *yihai* year of the Yongping era, it was said that men of Kaifeng opened the tomb of Prince Cao Gao. They took the stone figures, sheep-and-horse bricks, and other such relics. The coffin remained intact, yet as soon as it was touched, it crumbled to ashes, leaving no trace of bone. Only a few gold vessels remained. Before the coffin stood a cast-silver basin, three *chi* wide, filled to the brim with water. At its center sat a jade child, three *chi* tall, and the water neither increased nor diminished. Thus was fulfilled the saying of Master Hong: \"Where jade is buried in a tomb, grasses and trees grow lush and moist; where gold abounds, they wither and parch.\" Since the reign of Zhenyuan, two hundred years had passed, yet the water in the basin never waned—such was the moisture of the jade.\n\nHongzhou’s Fengcheng County once lay south of the Po River, the very place where Lei Huan unearthed his swords. After the Yellow Scarves’ uprising, warfare raged everywhere, and the county’s lands were largely encroached upon by Fuzhou. Commissioner Tang Bao relocated the townsfolk north of the river, building a city atop Red Ridge. Its front faced sheer cliffs, deemed a natural stronghold. Graves were dug up to construct houses for the people, and markets of several thousand households arose upon the site. Many malevolent spirits appeared—tall and monstrous in form—injuring all who saw them. When Magistrate Tang was in the county, the people lived in peace. But whenever he left on official business, the spirits ran rampant, beyond restraint. Upon his return, all was calm again.\n\nLater, Tang was promoted to regional commissioner, and Magistrate Guo succeeded him in governing the county. The spirits submitted to Guo as they had to Tang. Yet if Guo briefly departed, the ghosts would wreak havoc. After several years, the county was abandoned and later restored to its original location. Within the yamen, the main hall proved especially uninhabitable. Recently, hundreds of refugee households from neighboring prefectures sought shelter there, but nearly all perished. At dusk and night, the ghosts often manifested, committing violence. It is suspected these were the vengeful spirits of ancient corpses buried in the old graves, though none know their age.\n\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll Eight—end.",

      "translated_text": "**Records of the Strange**\n\n**Title:** *Records of the Strange*. Compiled by Du Guangting of the late Tang and Five Dynasties period. Eight fascicles. Based on the text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, category of hagiographies in the *Dongxuan* section.\n\nThough the sage does not speak of the uncanny, the mighty, chaos, or spirits, the classics, scriptures, and historical records often contain such accounts. Earlier works like *Accounts of the Strange*, *Records of Broad Learning*, and *Collections of Marvels* belong to this tradition. As for the charts and apocrypha of the Six Classics, the books of the Yellow River and Luo River, they separately record matters of yin and yang, divine transformations, omens of fortune and misfortune—all arising with the two *qi* and manifesting through the Five Phases. Whether auspicious stars and sweet dew, joined jades and linked pearls, fine wheat and rare grain, precious birds and rare beasts, divine mushrooms and spirit elixirs, propitious clouds and sweet springs, or transformations between strange creatures and humans, all emerge when their destined number arrives, inevitably coming into being. When their number is exhausted, they inevitably vanish. Just as field mice become quails, pheasants become mirages, sparrows turn into clams, and hawks into turtledoves; as stellar essences descend to become worthy ministers and mountain spirits ascend to become loyal aides—what this record contains is but a fraction of such abundance. Moreover, like the spirit of the stone at Shenshi in Jin, possessing people to bargain for objects, or the blood of crows and the size of fish becoming disasters and portents—though these startle the ear at first, upon verification, they prove tied to the cycles of destiny. Within the vast realm, no day passes without such occurrences. In moments of leisure, I have casually gathered and recorded them, sometimes verifying through what I have seen and heard, sometimes drawing from regional records. May those fond of such matters find no lack in perusing these accounts. Thus, I name it *Records of the Strange*. Your servant Guangting respectfully prefaces.\n\n---\n\n**Fascicle One**\n\nCompiled by the Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, the Broadly Accomplished Master, and Duke of Cai, your servant, Master Du.\n\n### **Immortals**\n\n**Master Ghost Valley** was an ancient perfected immortal. His surname was Wang, and he lived from the time of the Yellow Emperor through the Shang and Zhou dynasties. He followed Lord Lao west to transform the Flowing Sands, and by the end of the Zhou, he returned to the Central Kingdom. Dwelling in Ghost Valley Mountain by the Han River, he transmitted the Dao to over a hundred disciples, though only Zhang Yi and Su Qin, who did not aspire to immortality, favored the arts of horizontal and vertical alliances. At that time, the royal net had collapsed, and the feudal lords warred against one another, oppressing the weak and bullying the few, their weapons stirring like clouds. The two disciples, having gained power, unleashed their tongues amid the Warring States, now meeting success, now failure, now adversity, now prosperity. They vied in cunning and eloquence, contending for fame and coveting rank, no longer holding the lofty aspirations of the cloudy forests.\n\nThe Master sent a letter to Yi and Qin, saying: \"Gentlemen, your achievements and fame are resplendent, yet spring arrives, and autumn does not linger. The flourishing sun is about to set; the times are growing old. Have you not seen the trees by the river? Chariots and horses break their branches, waves and currents erode their roots. These trees bear no enmity toward the world—it is simply where they dwell. Have you not seen the pines and cedars of Mount Song and Mount Tai, the blossoming trees of Mount Hua? Their upper leaves touch the azure clouds, their roots reach the three springs. Above dwell dark foxes and black apes; below lurk leopards and hidden dragons. For a thousand autumns and ten thousand years, they never encounter the calamity of axes. These trees share no kinship with the world—it is simply where they dwell. Now, you two favor the glory of cloudy paths and admire enduring merit, scorning the eternal longevity of towering pines and venerating the fleeting titles of a single night. How lamentable! How lamentable, gentlemen!\"\n\nYi and Qin replied: \"Master, you embody virtue and embrace the vast, hunger satisfied by divine mushrooms, thirst quenched by jade nectar. Your power shines as brightly as the gods, equal to the Three Luminaries. You have not forgotten to send us a letter, warning against greed and delusion. Though I, Yi, am dull-witted and my fame obscure, I entered Qin to aid its hegemony, hoping to assist the lord of the age. Your analogy of the riverbank and the mountains, though I have long been empty of substance, truly resonates with this intent. We say: How magnificent! Master, your dark vision and distant insight make the rise and fall of things as clear as day.\"",

      "translated_text": "The two gentlemen could not suppress their ambitions nor withdraw from the world, content with the pleasures of insects in dreams or nests in reeds and bamboo—self-destructing to the point of annihilation. How lamentable! How grievous!\n\n**The Messenger of the Nine Heavens of Mount Lu**\nDuring the Kaiyuan era, the Emperor dreamed of divine immortals and their feathered retinue—thousands of chariots, tens of thousands of riders—gathering in the sky. One figure, clad in crimson robes and a golden crown, descended in a carriage. He addressed the Emperor, saying: *\"I am the Nine Heavens’ Inspector, patrolling and investigating the mortal realm. I wish to establish a lower palace on the northwest of Mount Lu. The foundation of timber and stone already exists; only labor is required.\"* The Emperor dispatched an emissary to the northwest of the mountain, where the traces of a foundation indeed lay evident. Overnight, thousands of massive logs arrived of their own accord, untouched by human hands. Halls, pavilions, and galleries were constructed according to their destined forms, all materials perfectly sufficient.\n\nSome say these logs were once gathered by the King of Jiujiang to build a palace, later sunk in the depths of Mipu in Jiangzhou. Now, divine beings had transported them for this purpose. To the west of the temple stretched a long corridor, its pillars and bases suspended over a vast ravine. Below, torrents roared, their depths unfathomable. Yet through the years, it never once faltered or sank. When the temple was first built, the timber arrived spontaneously—tens of thousands of logs in a single night, all bearing water marks. The foundations of gates, halls, and corridors emerged naturally, untouched by human tools or rammed earth. Five-colored divine radiance illuminated the temple grounds, as bright as daylight. Axes swung and labor progressed without pause, yet the workers never wearied. Within a month, the work was complete.\n\nAs construction finished, the imperial emissary dreamed of a divine being who said: *\"Vermilion, ochre, cinnabar, and green pigments lie buried in the earth to the north of the temple—seek and you shall find them. No need to search afar.\"* They investigated and indeed obtained all they required, lacking nothing. Later, at the ferry of Jianchang, over five hundred divine officials—dressed in the robes of Daoist priests—appeared, declaring they were en route to the Messenger’s temple. Their images remain preserved there.\n\nEarlier, when Emperor Xuanzong dreamed of the divine being, he summoned the alchemist of Mount Tiantai, Sima Chengzhen, to inquire about the matter. Chengzhen memorialized: *\"The renowned mountains, great peaks, and sacred rivers are served by spirits who receive blood sacrifices. The Supreme Lord, fearing they might recklessly wield power to harm the common people, dispatched perfected immortals to oversee the mountains and rivers. There are the Five Marchmount True Lords, with the Elder of Qingcheng as their chief. The Nine Heavens Controller of Life on Mount Song governs the registers of mortal lives, while the Nine Heavens Messenger of Mount Lu holds the records of the Three Heavens. They investigate and discipline the myriad spirits, all under the authority of the Five Marchmounts. Each has temples established where offerings of vegetarian feasts are presented.\"* That year, temples were erected for the Five Marchmounts and the Three Sacred Mountains.\n\nAt the Yellow Crane Tower in Ezhou, before the river, stands a stele of Perfected Luo. It records that Perfected Luo once appeared in Ezhou, his hair bound in twin topknots, his age around forty. He worked as a laborer in a commoner’s household, never speaking. One day, during a grand gathering in the prefecture, he suddenly rebuked a man in the crowd, ordering him to leave at once. The man, terrified, bowed in apology and fled into the river beneath the tower. The onlookers were all astonished.",

      "translated_text": "The prefect inquired into the matter, and the man replied: \"The one I rebuked was the White Dragon of the river. It intended to bring disaster upon this city, so I drove it away.\" The prefect, doubting his words, requested to witness the White Dragon himself to verify the truth. The man then accompanied the prefect to the tower, where he cast a talisman into the river. Suddenly, the waters darkened, and the White Dragon appeared—hundreds of *zhang* in length—visible to all. Soon after, it was sent away again. This man was none other than Perfected Luo. Nowadays, Perfected Luo Gongyuan often appears in Shu, frequently presiding over matters of flood and drought. The one seen in Ezhou may well have been Gongyuan.\n\nKing An of Huainan was fond of the Dao of immortals and transcendence. Many masters of esoteric arts from across the land gathered in his court. One day, the Eight Lords arrived, their appearances withered and frail, their bodies bent with age. The gatekeeper said to them: \"The King seeks those who pursue the Dao of immortality, transcendence, and longevity—those who must possess extraordinary abilities. He extends his courtesy only to such individuals. Now, your aged and feeble state is not what the King should see.\" Though rebuffed several times, the Eight Lords persisted in seeking an audience, and the gatekeeper repeated his refusal. The Eight Lords said: \"The King finds us too old and does not wish to meet us. Yet if we were to appear youthful, would that be difficult?\" With that, they straightened their robes, composed their bearing, and instantly transformed into the likeness of young boys. Startled, the gatekeeper led them inside. The King rushed to greet them, sandals reversed in his haste, and with reverent courtesy addressed them as disciples: \"Noble immortals, you have descended from afar—how may I be instructed?\" When asked their names, they replied: \"We are known as Wen the Five Constants, Wu the Seven Virtues, Zhi the Hundred Blossoms, Shou the Thousand Years, Ye the Ten Thousand Roots, Ming the Nine Marshes, Xiu the Three Fields, and Cen the One Peak.\" Each possessed the power to summon wind and rain, shake thunder and lightning, overturn heaven and earth, reverse the sun’s course and halt the rivers’ flow, command ghosts and spirits, lash demons and specters, traverse fire and water, shift mountains and rivers, and perform transformations beyond measure.\n\nAt that time, the King’s minor official, Wu Bei, had committed an offense and feared execution. Anxious and unsettled, he went to the imperial court to report a rebellion, accusing King An of treason. Emperor Wu grew suspicious and dispatched the Grand Master of Ceremonies with an imperial edict to Huainan to investigate. Before the Grand Master arrived, the Eight Lords said to the King: \"Wu Bei, though a subject, has falsely accused his lord—heaven will surely punish him. You must depart now. This is also heaven’s decree for you. Without this matter, day after day would pass, and how could you ever leave the mortal world?\"",

      "translated_text": "Then they took a cauldron to boil the elixir, had the King ingest it, and along with nearly three hundred of his kin and close attendants, they ascended to heaven on the same day. Even the chickens and dogs that had licked the vessels containing the elixir likewise flew away with them. The Eight Lords and the King paused their horses upon a mountain boulder, leaving only the tracks of men and steeds behind—no one knew where they had gone.\n\nWhen the Grand Master of Ceremonies arrived and reported these events to the Emperor, the Emperor was filled with deep regret and ordered the execution of Wu Bei. From then on, he broadly summoned masters of esoteric arts, seeking the elixir of transcendence, but never obtained it. Later, when the Queen Mother of the West descended, she bestowed upon him the *Scriptures of Immortality* and secretly granted him the *Numinous Formulae*, through which he attained the Dao of *corpse liberation*. Thus, the *Mao Ling*, *Jade Casket*, and *Golden Staff* texts reemerged among men, and the *Scripture of the Ox-Holding Path* was discovered in mountain caverns—these were also signs left for Emperor Wu of his own immortality.\n\nLi Yuanxing, a Daoist of the Zhi Zhen Abbey in Chengdu, during the Longshuo era, wished to construct an abbey on the Learning Archery Mountain. One night, he dreamed of a divine being leading him up a high mountain into a grand hall, where he paid homage to the Central Yellow Lord Lao. The Lord stood several *zhang* tall, with a snowy white beard and whiskers, wearing a golden phoenix crown and a robe of cloud and mist, attended by over ten retainers. Turning to Yuanxing, he said: \"I have timber nearby that may be used to build this abbey—do not trouble yourself.\" For several nights in succession, he dreamed the same. Then, a man fishing from a boat in the Ten-Thousand-Years Pond noticed the water was exceptionally clear and saw many large logs at the bottom. He informed Yuanxing, who sent men to retrieve them. They obtained over a thousand pieces of black poplar, some reaching a hundred *chi* in length, which were used to construct the abbey. They built a hall for the Yellow Lord Lao, sculpting his image as seen in the dream. They also constructed a Three Sages Hall, lecture halls, fasting altars, chambers, corridors, and gates—all the timber was sufficient for the task.\n\nIn the fourth year of the Yongping era, the *jiayin* year, Wang Chengshang, the Prefect of Lizhou, memorialized that twenty *li* west of Shendu Pass, within the depths of the mountains, lay the Yang Mo Cavern of the Long Dao Mountain. Perched amid sheer cliffs, it was a place no mortal could reach. Within the cavern, immortals had long dwelled—sometimes three, sometimes five—dressed in yellow and purple, often appearing to those below. At that time, the number of those seen had grown. The Emperor issued an edict dispatching the Master of Daoist Rites, the Venerable Master of Concentrated Truth, and the Silent Mirror Scholar Ren Keyan, along with the Inner Great Virtue Shi Zhaoxun, to present imperial incense and *blue-green memorials* and accompany the eunuch Yang Zhishu to perform rites of thanksgiving. The immortals reappeared as before. The Emperor then renamed Jinggu County as Jinxian County, Long Dao Mountain as Xuandu Mountain, and Yang Mo Cavern as Zixia Cavern. He further enfeoffed the master of Xuandu Mountain as the Duke of Jade Clarity, established the Zixia Abbey to commemorate the event, and granted the county magistrate Li Yue the *flying-fish* insignia and a formal appointment.\n\nBy the great river of Enzhou, where cliffs rose ten thousand *ren* high, a cavern opened in the sheer rock face, within which immortals dwelled. Boatmen on the river would call out to them, and they would often emerge, clad in purple robes, gazing down at the riverbank for a long while before departing. Beneath the cavern, the river shoals were shallow, and passing boats would unload their cargo there to lighten their vessels before proceeding. Liu Zaihong of Xuchuan once passed this shoal. The boatmen recounted the tale, and he called out several times—sure enough, the immortals appeared.\n\nAtop the mountain’s highest peak stood many stone pillars, towering and solitary, some nearly a thousand *chi* tall, others several hundred, all gleaming with a pure, white luster like congealed cream or piled snow, untouched by human footsteps. Among the mountains of Qian and Xia, the Greater and Lesser You were both secluded and sublime realms, the abodes of immortals.\n\nSu, a scholar-official, was fond of wine and would sing the *Wang Jiangnan*. Skilled in crafting polo mallets, he mingled with the common folk while secretly cultivating the Dao. Whenever he lacked something, he would use his polo mallet to barter with others, exchanging the gold he received for wine. One day, in broad daylight within the prefecture, he ascended to heaven—this occurred around the *renshen* and *guiyou* years. Zhang Wenhuan, the magistrate of Fenxi in Jinzhou, recounted this tale.\n\nWhen the immortal Lord Xu was still in the world, he once oversaw the renovation of an abbey. Upon its completion, he wished to inscribe a stele to record the event. He found an ancient stele, but its characters were worn and unrecognizable. He had the old inscription carved away to engrave a new record, but from then on, he felt restless and uneasy. One leisurely day, as he strolled through the courtyard, he heard a voice from the void say: \"Lord Xu, Lord Xu, hasten to the Water Bureau to seek salvation, or you will face unforeseen calamity.\" Startled, he asked again, but no answer came. He then burned incense at the hearth and prayed earnestly, wishing to know the reason for seeking salvation. After a long while, the voice spoke again: \"Though the old inscription on the stele you carved has been erased, the one who composed it has lodged a complaint with the Water Bureau, accusing you of usurping his name to make yours known. Thus, the Water Bureau will soon issue a summons for confrontation—you must seek their aid swiftly.\" Lord Xu then sought out the original inscription and had it re-engraved on the stele. That night, he dreamed of a divine being thanking him, saying: \"Now that my name has been restored, I have no way to repay you. I ask that you hold a grand *Water and Land Rite*, proclaiming it to the myriad spirits of mountains and rivers. With the Three Bureaus’ endorsement, you may attain the *verification of the Dao*.\" Lord Xu followed the instructions and thus achieved the fruit of the Dao. From then on, the method of the *Water and Land Rite* was transmitted among men. The Daoist Yang Jingzhao of Chengdu recounted this tale.\n\nMa Daoliu, named Zhineng, often wandered among rivers and lakes. In the *dingsi* year of the Qianning era, he arrived at the Jade Beam Abbey. At the time, a grand fast was being held, and Zhineng ascended directly to the mountain’s summit. The Daoist community tried to detain him, but he pressed on. At the summit, in the place where the Nine Immortals had attained the Dao, he sat in perfect composure and transformed, his complexion unchanged, his limbs supple—no different from when he was alive.\n\nSima Ningzheng, who studied books and loved the Dao, had long wandered among rivers and lakes. In the early Xiantong era, he, along with the Daoists Bai Wuyu and Zhang Jianbai, transcribed the *True Scriptures* at the Cavern of Perfected Reality Abbey.",

Later, he resided on Mount Lianping at White Horse Creek, upon the Great Flat Rock. The stone, white as frost and smooth as whetstone, could seat ten. Beside it stood a tree whose branches cast cooling shade, so that even in the scorching heat of summer, the place felt like autumn. Taochui rested and reclined there. Many lovers of antiquity often visited the site. Zhu would sometimes split cartwheels for sustenance. Former Prefect Li Houde and later Prefect Gao Shilian sent him bows and banners, or letters, but he only smiled in disdain and never replied. The Grand Guardian of the Crown Prince, Xue Ji of Hedong, composed a eulogy and portrait for him:\n\n*\"The Master knows contentment,\ndwelling apart in leisure.\nNever haggling over price,\neating but once a day.\nHis hut is of tamped earth,\nhis cap of rolled leaves.\nThe art of splitting wheels—\njoy shared with Bian [Que] alike.\"*\n\nThe *Ode to the Thatched Hut of the Recluse Zhu Taochui* by Xue Ji:\n\n*\"As for those who embrace emptiness,\nworldly affairs bring no glory.\nThe hidden and wandering kind\nfind joy in quiet seclusion.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Thus, even Confucius, that paragon of understanding, endured the mockery of Jie Ni; and Ji Kang, that lofty man, suffered the reproach of Sun Deng. How much more so for one who roams mountains and rivers, scattering his will to delight the spirit—inquiring beyond the thatched hut’s eaves, his thoughts fixed beyond the azure clouds, freeing his worldly cares, and fulfilling his noble aspirations in an enlightened age.\n\nIts preface reads: Behold my humble abode, refined yet rustic in the wilds, standing alone beside the mountain, its lofty bearing unmatched. Steep cliffs, though crumbling, channel the wind; hanging crags, though collapsing, pour forth the sunlight. At times of leisure, as evening thoughts turn to the beauty of the scene, the verdant spring stirs this valley, and my heart and spirit are entrusted to it. I carve wild blossoms into a staff, roll bamboo leaves into a headband. I do not prize fame, nor treasure pearls and jade. Naturally, I draw out a whistle in the wind, or sleep soundly beneath the moon. My courtyard holds but three paths; my zither, but one string. I wander idly by the pond, roam freely among the cliffs and ravines—carefree, with no attachment, my will and intent ever self-content. Facing the bright moon, I pluck the zither; before the clear breeze, I sip my wine. Gazing at the green pines upon the ridge, listening to the white cranes among the clouds, I delight in the mountains and waters, forgetting the loneliness of zither and books. In the valley, the cries of birds seem especially rich, their many voices and tones harmonizing of their own accord. I see the许毛’s feathered robes truly tangled like brocade; I hear their melodies, so like the cadence of strings—now slow, now swift—as they gather toward my thatched hut. At times, a pair of mandarin ducks arrives; often, wandering bees enter. When the ice melts, the green waters flow anew; when the grass grows, the steps before me are once more damp.\n\nMy intent is not to befriend the world; my intent is not to envy the establishment of merit and fame. I know that worldly affairs are all in vain—how much better to dwell in seclusion, ever restrained. Initially, when Magistrate Xue governed Pengshan, he heard of Zhu’s reputation and delighted in it, composing the *Rhapsody on the Thatched Hut* to present to him. Later, upon resigning his post and returning to the capital, Xue took a detour to pay a visit, only to find the hut already empty. Yet the traces remained vivid. Inquiring among the villagers, he learned that Master Zhu came and went, now hidden, now revealed—truly one who had attained the Dao. Magistrate Xue inscribed a eulogy upon the wall before returning to Chang’an. Several years later, villagers would occasionally see Master Zhu, though none knew his whereabouts in the end. The stone where he had secluded himself is no longer visible; beneath the great tree, only a stone grotto remains. In recent years, the entrance to the grotto has also closed. Later, an official fond of such matters had the rhapsody engraved on a stele and erected beside the grotto’s entrance, near the main road. Yet villagers who come to pray, burn incense, and make offerings find it often responds with efficacy. If not one who had attained the Dao and realized its fruits, who could achieve such a state?\n\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll One—concluded.\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll Two.",

      "translated_text": "Du Guangting, Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, President of the Board of Revenue in the Department of State Affairs, and Duke of Cai, compiles:\n\n**Extraordinary Figures**\n\n**Li Te**, styled Xuanxiu, was a descendant of the Lin Lords. In ancient times, the Wu Luo Zhongli Mountain collapsed, revealing two stone caves—one red as cinnabar, the other black as lacquer. From the red cave emerged a man named Wu Xiang, of the Ba clan. From the black cave emerged four clans: the Hao, Fan, Wu, and Zheng. All five clans contended for leadership. Wu Xiang proposed a trial: whoever could lodge a sword in the cave wall would become the Lin Lord. The four clans failed, but Wu Xiang’s sword hung firmly. Next, they fashioned boats of earth, carved and painted them, and set them afloat, declaring, \"Whoever’s boat floats shall be the Lin Lord.\" Only Wu Xiang’s boat remained buoyant. Thus, he was called Mo Lord. Boarding his earthen vessel with his followers, he descended along the Yi River until he reached Ziyan. The water deity of Guanyang, a woman, barred his way, saying, \"This land abounds in fish and salt; it is vast enough for us both. Stay, do not go further.\" Mo Lord replied, \"I must seek land for my people. I cannot stay.\"\n\nThe salt deity spent nights with Mo Lord but departed at dawn, transforming into a flying insect. All the spirits followed, darkening the sky. Mo Lord sought to kill her but could not. For ten days, he lost all sense of direction, unable to distinguish east from west. Finally, he gave the salt deity a blue thread, saying, \"Wear this. If it suits you, we shall live together. If not, I shall leave you.\" The deity took the thread and wore it. Mo Lord climbed onto a sunlit rock and, spotting the blue thread, knelt and shot her. The arrow struck true; the salt deity died, and the swarm of spirits dispersed. The sky cleared.\n\nMo Lord boarded his earthen boat once more and descended to Yicheng. The stone banks of Yicheng curved like a cave, as did the spring waters. Mo Lord sighed, \"I have but lately emerged from a cave, and now I enter another. What fate is this?\" The bank collapsed, forming a breach over three *zhang* wide, with steps leading upward. Mo Lord ascended and found a flat stone, five *chi* long and one *zhang* wide. He rested upon it, casting his divining stalks and tallying accounts—all adhered to the stone. He built a city beside it and dwelled there. His descendants multiplied, and when Qin unified the realm, the land became Qianzhong Commandery. In years of light taxation, the people paid forty thousand coins. The Ba people called tribute *bao* (\"treasure\"), and so they were called the *shi* (\"substantial\") people.\n\n**Yuan Qi**, a man of Xiangzhong during the Later Han, once fell into a drunken stupor in his village. After three days, he awoke, his breath reeking of wine. He claimed to have drunk with heavenly spirits. Later, as magistrate of Hanyang, his predictions of abundance or scarcity proved accurate. By day, he judged the living; by night, the dead. Suddenly, he ascended to heaven on a cloud, and none knew his whereabouts thereafter.\n\n**Master Qizhen Li Xifan** resided at the Xuan Yuan Abbey on Northern Yu Mountain. By the end of the Xiantong era, he had lived there for several years. Whenever he entered Luoyang through the Hui’an Gate, he would change his attire and rest his horse. There was a scholar named Li, of unknown origin, aged about fifty, who treated Master Li with the courtesy due an uncle. Li invited the master to his home, where a dozen pupils studied. He had a wife and a son, and though his household was poor, they barely managed each day. Thereafter, the master often visited and stayed at the school, growing unusually close to Li.\n\nOne evening, Li came to Yu Mountain to bid the master farewell. They sat by the hearth, talking late into the night. The master asked where he was bound. Li replied, \"This parting is my departure from the world, not a distant journey. I have been appointed by the underworld to oversee the daily water supply for a city’s households. My term ends this month; I cannot stay longer. In three days, I shall die, and in five, my wife and son will bury me beneath this mountain. What I lack is a thousand coins to hire mourners. I entrust this to you, my Daoist brother, and bid you farewell.\" He added, \"The people of the world use no more than three to five *sheng* of water daily. Exceeding this invites misfortune and karmic reckoning. Be vigilant.\" When asked about his family’s future, Li said, \"My wife will remarry a man named Wang. My son is destined for the monastic life, but his master resides in the south and will not arrive for two years. His name is Xingcheng. Until then, he may stay at the abbey.\"\n\nThe master asked, \"Could he not enter the Dao?\" Li replied, \"He is meant for the sangha, not the Dao. This is not a matter of human will but of predestined rank.\" At dawn, he departed. Thereafter, snow and cold delayed the master’s return to Luoyang for five days. When the skies cleared, Li’s wife and several companions visited the master, saying, \"Li has passed. He was buried beneath the mountain this morning. He owed a thousand coins, which he entrusted to you. We have come to collect it.\" She left her son at the abbey.\n\nLater, the monk Xingcheng from the south arrived and lodged in the master’s chamber. The master entrusted Li’s son to him. Xingcheng gladly took the boy, saying, \"Since there is a prior agreement, I shall teach him the Dharma and ordain him.\" Two years later, Xingcheng returned, and the boy had become a monk. He had mastered the *Lotus Sutra* with great precision. Earlier, the master had given him Daoist scriptures, but after a year, he could not memorize a single page. Truly, a person’s destiny is fixed—he was indeed meant for the sangha.\n\n**Li Ye** sat for the imperial examinations but failed. On his return, he encountered Shanhao Mountain. A sudden thunderstorm forced him to seek shelter in a village home. The nearest neighbors were far off, and the household had only a young boy tending the house.",

      "translated_text": "Li Ye tethered his donkey beneath the eaves. Left Army Officer Li and Acting Official Yang Zhen also sought shelter in the house. Li had a horse, and together they entered the dwelling. By the time the storm had somewhat cleared, it was already dusk. The young boy said, \"Uncle Ang dislikes guests. You should leave now.\" Li Ye replied, \"The nearest homes are far away, and the day is already late. It would be impossible to go on.\" Soon after, an old man returned. Seeing the guests, he was delighted and welcomed them with exceptional courtesy, urging them to stay the night. At dawn, he earnestly insisted on preparing a meal, but Li Ye repeatedly declined. He then said, \"My grandson said Uncle Ang dislikes guests, and I was also worried that traveling at night would be impossible. I am deeply troubled by this unexpected kindness—how can I repay such generosity?\" The old man replied, \"My family is poor and has little to offer guests. This is merely a temporary courtesy, not that I dislike company. However, all three of you are military commissioners—how could I not serve you properly?\" Li Ye said, \"Among the three of us, only one is an acting official. You exaggerate.\" The old man said, \"An acting official holds the iron tally of command, ranking above a cavalry commander. A scholar’s authority comes after a cavalry commander’s. Still, you hold five iron tallies—take care of yourself. After failing the examinations for so many years, you will later join the military.\" The following year, Yang Zhen was promoted by Chancellor Qiu Shiliang and rose through the ranks to become a military commander before being appointed as the Jiezhou Military Commissioner. Li and Zhen simultaneously became military commanders, with Li governing Dengzhou. For his merits in suppressing the Dangxiang, Li Ye was appointed to Zhenwu and then Jingzhou, eventually holding five military governorships—his iron tallies matching the old man’s words exactly.\n\nJing Zhiguo was also a man of the Dao. He lived on Doufu Mountain, dwelling among tigers and leopards, which he tamed like household dogs. Several crows perched on his shoulders and arms, chirping and playing as if it were ordinary. A giant serpent would sometimes appear, but when Zhiguo scolded and dismissed it, it would slither away. Three or four tigers would often wrestle in his courtyard on moonlit nights, their fierce struggles shaking the ground. Enraged, Zhiguo would seize a white staff and strike them, scattering them in retreat. Beside his abode grew creeping vines, and rabbits would lie undisturbed among them. He could move them with his hands as if they were cats or dogs. Such was his intimacy with extraordinary creatures.\n\nOne day, he vanished without a trace. Wang, an aide in Fengzhou, was at the time serving in the chancellery of Minister Man. Among the staff, Wang was particularly close to the aides. A guest named Ren Sanlang was also present, well-known to the chancellery officials but especially intimate with Wang. One day, Ren suddenly said to Wang, \"If you encounter a minor setback, consider it your good fortune.\" A month later, Wang unexpectedly fell out of the minister’s favor. Claiming illness, he remained secluded for over a hundred days, during which the minister ignored him entirely, and all communication ceased. Ren visited occasionally. One day, he told Wang, \"This place is about to face disaster. The great tree on the official street has withered—trouble is approaching. When its leaves fall, the event will unfold. Hurry and seek a physician to escape this calamity.\" Wang, still wary of the minister’s lingering anger, hesitated. Ren said, \"Submit three petitions, and you will receive instructions.\" Following his advice, Wang submitted three petitions within days, requesting leave to seek medical treatment in the Guanzhong region. Soon after, an envoy arrived with the minister’s encouragement, urging him to depart immediately. He was given bolts of silk and other gifts far more generous than usual. Wang then entered to express his gratitude. The minister hosted a farewell banquet and presented him with brocades and embroidered fabrics. Upon returning home, he was pressed to leave for the north within ten days. At the outskirts, Minister Man hosted a farewell feast, bestowing over two hundred gifts. Fifteen or sixteen days later, Wang arrived in Wushan County and took up residence. Another ten days passed before news from Fengzhou arrived: a military mutiny had erupted. Minister Man fled to Baozhong, and all his staff perished in the disaster. Wang alone escaped misfortune. Later, he inquired about Ren’s whereabouts and visited his former residence, but Ren had vanished without a trace.\n\nHuang Qi was a low-ranking officer in the palace guard. For many years, he had been devoted to the Dao and performed secret good deeds. On Chaotian Ridge, he encountered an old man with snowy hair and beard, his complexion like that of a child, his skin smooth as jade. The old man said to him, \"Since you are devoted to the Dao, in five years you will face great peril. I will surely save you. Cultivate hidden virtues and do not abandon your resolve.\" Later, Huang Qi traveled downstream through the gorges. His boat capsized, and he was swept to a shoal. As if aided by an unseen force, he reached the shore—only to find the old man from before. The old man soon disappeared, but Huang Qi would occasionally encounter him again. One day, he saw him in a market in Shiyu County and was invited to his home. They left the city through the north gate and walked through a forest for two or three *li* before arriving. The mountains, streams, and woods formed a secluded and beautiful landscape. Huang Qi stayed the night. The old man said, \"The mountains and rivers of Shu are a land of great fortune, destined to be an imperial capital. Many sages of past dynasties have suppressed its dragon veins, delaying its rise. I know all these places well. Also, the character for *Shu* (蜀), if you remove the *chong* (虫) and add *jin* (金), becomes *zheng* (正), signifying the enduring power of metal. The king of the west will unify the realm. You should tell others this.\" At dawn, the old man saw him to the gate, and Huang Qi found himself in the mountains behind the city, over seventy *li* from the county.

      "translated_text": "The Daoist Hao Fazun resided at the Simplicity and Tranquility Abbey on Mount Lu, his Daoist practice precise and rigorous. For years, he labored alone in his duties, without any disciples. One night, he dreamed that the Master of the Mystic Realm said to him, \"You have no one to assist you and work most diligently. Now, two young boys shall come to you—only regrettable that they are still small.\" Upon waking, he recounted the dream to others. When he left the mountain and passed through a village, a family named Wang had a child barely a year old. At the sight of Fazun, the child clung to his feet and would not let go. After Fazun departed, the child wept day and night for days on end. Yet when Fazun returned, the child greeted him joyfully. The parents said, \"In three to five years, we shall offer him to you as a novice.\" Another boy, surnamed Liu, had eyes that emitted light of five colors. His parents, deeming this strange, cauterized the corners of his eyes, and the light vanished. When he was four or five years old, they offered him to the abbey. Now grown, he has entered the Dao in succession, fulfilling the words of the dream from the Mystic Realm.\n\nThe Vice Director of Hunan, Gentleman Zheng Wanting of the Bureau of Judicature and Revision, now serves as Prefect of Lianzhou. Once, while at the foot of Mount Heng, he entrusted a letter to his elder brother, the Fish Supervisor, in a coarse hempen robe. When his son was born, seven cranes circled above their dwelling. On the seventh day, seven cranes returned. On the one hundred twentieth day, twenty-seven cranes arrived together. The sky was clear, the clouds and atmosphere slightly unusual, and they lingered for the entire day before departing. The child born was of a most pure and sincere nature, his bearing dignified and solemn. He was thus named \"Crane.\" This occurred in the *gengshen* year of the Tianfu era.\n\nThe Daoist Jiao Huang of Mount Siming recorded this matter in his annals.\n\nOne day, the Grand Preceptor Li Deyu of Dunhuang received a visit from an old man at his gate, accompanied by five or six others. They ascended a great tree and requested an audience. Though the gatekeepers sought to turn them away, the Grand Preceptor, intrigued, received them. The old man said, \"My family has treasured this mulberry wood for three generations. Now that I am aged, I am moved by your love of the rare and extraordinary, and wish to present it to you. Within this wood lies a wondrous treasure. If one skilled enough cuts it, something extraordinary will surely be found. In Luoyang, there is a craftsman, though by now he may be old or even deceased. His descendants, however, should have inherited his techniques. None but a Luoyang craftsman can cut this wood.\" The Grand Preceptor followed his advice and inquired in Luoyang, only to find the craftsman had passed away. His son, summoned to attend, examined the wood and said, \"This may be cut slowly.\" He then split it into two pipa soundboards. Naturally, they bore the form of white wagtails, with wings, claws, and feet all perfectly rendered in minute detail. Yet the craftsman’s slight miscalculation in thickness left one wagtail missing a wing. The Grand Preceptor presented the complete one to the throne and kept the other for himself. It remains among the people to this day. Lu Yanrang, Vice Director of the Bureau of Waterways, learned of this from the Grand Preceptor’s grandson.",

      "translated_text": "In the northern frontier of Hongzhou, at the Great Five Wharves, there lived a man of the Hu clan, whose given name is now lost. The Hu family was once poor, with five sons, the youngest of whom was of extraordinary bearing. After his birth, the family’s fortunes gradually improved. Through farming and sericulture, their strength grew abundant, and the villagers all marveled at them. The family sent this son to transport wheat by boat downriver to the market in the prefectural city. Before reaching their destination, they encountered a treacherous stretch of riverbank where the towpath was impassable, forcing them to cross the current. As the boat neared the shore, the force of the water proved uncontrollable, and the sand gave way beneath the collapsing bank. In the hollow thus exposed, they discovered several million coins. Abandoning the wheat, they loaded the money and returned home. From then on, the family grew ever wealthier, purchasing servants and horses, adorning themselves in fine attire. All said this son was blessed with fortune and unsuited to remain long in the village. Thus, they sent him to frequent the cities, where he gradually grew accustomed to worldly affairs.\n\nOne day, mid-journey, the horse he rode suddenly pawed at the ground and refused to advance. Turning to his servant, he said, \"Where the boat struck the shore and we found money, the horse’s stamping may likewise conceal something.\" He ordered his attendants to dig, and they unearthed five hundred taels of gold, which they took home.\n\nLater, while visiting the city, he encountered a foreign merchant who, recognizing a pearl embedded in his skull, had someone lure him. Familiar with the man’s easy nature, they plied him with wine and took the pearl. Originally, a fleshy protrusion the shape of a half-sphere had risen on his forehead. After losing the pearl, the flesh sank inward. Upon returning home, his kin and friends all sighed in astonishment. Thereafter, the son’s spirit waned, and he fell ill and died. The family’s livelihood also gradually declined.\n\nZhao Zhong, Prefectural Governor of Xuancheng, likewise bore a fleshy protrusion on his forehead, leading people to suspect he too possessed a pearl. Later, when the Huainan army seized his counties, Zhao was killed by rebel soldiers. A soldier searching for his head split open his forehead, retrieved the pearl, and sold it to a foreign merchant. The merchant said, \"This man’s pearl is now dead and cannot be used again,\" so he sold it to artisans who fashioned it into a pearl for a Buddha’s forehead.\n\nZhao Wunu was a native of Shijing in Hezhou, residing on the grounds of the Dayun Temple. Early in his mother’s pregnancy, she gave birth to a tiger, which was cast into the river. After several more months, she bore a giant turtle, which was also discarded. Another few months passed, and she delivered a yaksha, over a foot tall, which too was abandoned. Several months later, she gave birth to Wunu. His eyebrows, eyes, ears, nose, and mouth were all perfectly formed, but from the neck down, his body resembled a severed gourd. He had shoulders and armpits, with two arms each several inches long, lacking elbows but with wrists and palms sprouting from round flesh, each hand bearing six fingers barely an inch long, complete with nails. Below, he had two feet, each one or two inches in length, also with six toes. At birth, his parents could not bear to abandon him. As he grew, he reached just over two feet in height. Skilled in water, he could navigate boats. His nature was cunning and clever, his speech sharp and persuasive, and he took great pleasure in killing. He made his living by fishing and butchering pigs. Whenever there were boat races, puppet shows, or competitions in singing *zhuzhi* songs, he invariably took first place. In market transactions, he always served as broker. He shaved his head and wore black robes, so the people called him Master Zhao. In his later years, he was merely bald with a white robe. Sometimes, when bowing or kneeling, he would tumble to the ground, exposing his form, much to the amusement of onlookers. When traveling far by donkey, he had someone carry him sideways in the saddle, like a bundle of clothes.\n\nHe had two wives and a daughter, living in comfort. Yet when he quarreled with his family, none could restrain him. In the early years of the Qiande reign, he was nearly sixty, with a waist and belly several spans around, his face and features no different from an ordinary man. His daughter’s right ring finger was seven or eight inches long, also unlike others.\n\nWhen Fu Jian first established his rule in Guanzhong, a tall man appeared and spoke to the commoner Zhang Jing, saying, \"Fu Jian has received the Mandate of Heaven, and now peace shall prevail. Those beyond the center shall return to it and know tranquility.\" When asked his name, he did not answer and soon vanished. The magistrate of Xinping reported this to Fu Jian, who deemed it heresy and imprisoned Zhang Jing. During a great downpour, the river at Pujin Ferry in the Wei region overflowed, and a supervisor named Kou Deng retrieved a sandal from the water. It measured seven feet and three inches in length. When compared to a man’s footprint, its toes were over a foot long, with tread marks an inch deep. Fu Jian sighed and said, \"What is there not between heaven and earth?\" He declared that Zhang Jing’s account was surely not false and pardoned him.",

His father had served as the prefect of Yanzhou, yet Tian alone cherished the Dao, reclining high amidst the clouds and forests. He was skilled in the arts of yin-yang divination, celestial observation, calendar calculation, alchemy, and the transmutation of base metals into gold. He was also versed in Peng Su’s methods, *Yijing* divination, talismanic script, clerical calligraphy, and poetic composition, mastering each to its fullest. In regulating his primal qi and refining his spirit, he devoted himself solely to the pursuit of immortality.\n\nIn the Jingfu era, while in Anzhou, he encountered Ma Chuqian of Shangcai, a fortune-teller who, despite his blindness, dutifully served his parents with filial piety. Moved by his plight—his learning incomplete and his provisions meager—Tian took him into the mountains and taught him the secrets of astrological calculation and prognostication. After more than a year, when his studies were complete, Tian sent him back down the mountain.\n\nAt that time, Ezhou suffered from a severe drought. Chancellor Du Hong met with Tian and spoke of prayers for rain. Tian examined the omens, cast a cinnabar talisman into the river, and soon a great downpour followed, bringing relief to the entire region. Though he was richly rewarded with gold and silk, he departed without a glance. Even summons from feudal lords could not sway him, and to this day, he remains in the mountains. He once admonished Chuqian: \"What I have learned is for myself, not for others. Because you are pure in filial devotion and reverent in conduct, I have taught you. If you seek to secure lifelong abundance through the arts of alchemy and transmutation, I could tell you, but it would only hasten your misfortune and cut short your life—something I would not regret. Do not boast of your knowledge or speak carelessly to invite calamity.\"\n\n\"All people are born of the five qi, which rise and fall; yin and yang wax and wane; the five planets move in direct and retrograde motion; and fate unfolds with fortune and misfortune. Yet those who accumulate good deeds bequeath blessings, while those who accumulate evil bequeath disaster. By observing one’s conduct, one may foresee calamity or prosperity. If goodness is not cultivated, no prayers or exorcisms can avert it.\"\n\nThus, though Chuqian would later speak of fortune and misfortune to others, he never performed rituals of exorcism or suppression. Later, he entered service in Shu as a minor general and was appointed Acting Minister of Works.\n\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll Two ends here.\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll Three begins.",

      "translated_text": "The Honorable Du Guangting, Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, President of the Board of Revenue in the Department of State Affairs, and Duke of Cai in the Guangcheng Prefecture, compiled this with reverence.\n\nIn the second year of Guangqi, the cyclical year bingwu, on the second day of the first month, renwu by the calendar, troops from Hedong entered the capital. At that time, the imperial carriage had already departed for Chen Cang, and the feudal lords arrived in succession to pay their respects. The Hedong commander searched the capital for court officials and discovered Minister of Ceremonies Niu Cong and three or four of his nephews in the well of Xinchang Ward. Along with military officer Lu Qian, they were to be taken to Hedong. Lu Qian, however, fell ill and was left by the well. Upon arriving in Hedong, Niu Cong was received with reverence by the Prince of Jin, who honored him beyond the respect due a teacher. Niu Cong, in turn, expounded to him the Way of loyalty and filial piety, as well as the rites of ruler and minister. The Prince of Jin also frequently consulted him on matters of court precedent, governance, and essential principles.\n\nIn the sixth month of that year, Emperor Xizong took refuge in Baoliang. Xiao Gou and Pei Che established the Prince of Xiang in Chang’an, proclaiming him Regent. The regions surrounding the capital, as well as Jiangnan and Hebei, all circulated the Prince of Xiang’s edicts to pacify the people. Some were granted ranks and titles, while others were ordered to present tribute. The court also dispatched Remonstrance Official Zheng Hejing and eunuch emissaries bearing edicts and patents to Hedong. Niu Cong said to the Prince of Jin: “We hear that the Emperor has halted his progress in Chen Cang and may soon proceed south to Liangyang. The enthronement of the Prince of Xiang does not enjoy the people’s support. Xiao and Pei, envious of the power held by the capital’s officials, did not wish to follow the Emperor south and thus made this move. With the true ruler still abroad, the Prince of Xiang’s edicts are not legitimate.” The Prince of Jin was startled and enraged. He executed the envoys and burned their edicts.\n\nFor over a month, the roads were blocked, and no further news of the court reached them. Niu Cong grew deeply anxious and distressed, which aggravated his illness. The Prince of Jin repeatedly sent physicians and medicines, even visiting him in person to urge him to eat, but his condition did not improve. Lu Qian, having recovered from his illness, begged for food along the roads from the Western Capital, seeking news of Niu Cong, and eventually reached Hedong. The Prince of Jin, admiring his loyalty, appointed him to a high office and said to his generals and officers: “If one serves his lord with such devotion as Lu Qian, I would strip off my own robes to clothe him and share my food with him. How could I begrudge him high rank or great rewards?”\n\nOne day, a physician suddenly told Niu Cong a rumor from the road: the Prince of Xiang had taken the throne, and the Emperor had passed away. Niu Cong cried out in grief, vomited blood, and collapsed. After a long while, he revived and drafted a final memorial, earnestly extolling the Prince of Jin’s loyalty, filial piety, and sincerity. He lamented his own age and illness, which prevented him from following the Emperor to pay his respects. His words were fervent and moving, stirring the emotions of all who read them. Weeping bitterly, he laid down his brush and died.\n\nThe Prince of Jin was stricken with grief for a long time. He executed the physician in retribution. He then dispatched a courier to submit Niu Cong’s memorial via Lu Qian to the imperial presence in Qifu. The Emperor, upon hearing of it, issued an edict praising Niu Cong’s loyalty and posthumously enfeoffed him as Duke of Loyalty and Integrity. Lu Qian was appointed Prefect of Huazhou.\n\nWhile Emperor Xizong was in Shu, he appointed Wang Dong, a Gentleman of the Ministry of Civil Appointments, as Magistrate of Wannian County and concurrently Vice Censor-in-Chief. Wang was the first to return to the capital. In the yisi year, when the imperial carriage returned to Chang’an, he was promoted to Right Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary. On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, the cyclical day yihai, the Hedong army breached the palace gates. At the third watch of the night, the Emperor fled to Baoji. Wang, who was then ill, could not follow to protect the imperial carriage. He took refuge in Pingkang Ward and later fled to the foot of the Southern Mountains. From then on, he shut his door and lived in seclusion, nursing his illness for months.\n\nThat summer, the Prince of Xiang assumed control in the capital. His decrees were harsh and urgent, and Xiao and Pei wielded power, instilling fear both within and beyond the court. Wang, feeling increasingly uneasy, rose from his sickbed. When the false edict arrived, appointing him Left Cavalier Attendant, he claimed illness and did not attend court, refusing the Prince of Xiang’s envoys. The imperial physicians examined him and offered medicines, but he accepted nothing. He wept bitterly and died. When the court and the people heard of it, none did not mourn his loss.\n\nWhen Emperor Xizong took refuge in Shu, Huang Chao captured Chang’an. Court officials from north and south arrived in succession to pay their respects. Before long, the Commandant of the Palace Guard, Zhang Zhifang, and the Chief Minister, Liu Ye, along with other officials at Cong, secretly discussed fleeing to the imperial court. The bandits discovered their plot and executed many. From then on, the roads to the east were blocked, and the capital was cut off from the outside world. Yet the capital still held vast stores of grain.\n\nThe skilled artisan Liu Wanyu, the musician Deng Manyi, the acrobat Zhaixing Hu, and the paper-cutter Mi Sheng secretly conferred: “The great bandits are invincible, and the capital’s granaries are full. Though the regional lords do not submit and no goods enter from outside, the supplies here could last for years. We have received the state’s favor and deeply wish to repay its kindness, but we have no means to escape and are forced to serve the rebels. Let us offer a strategy to exhaust their supplies. If no goods come from outside and the internal stores are depleted, they will collapse within a year or two.”\n\nLiu Wanyu, favored by Huang Chao for his skill, often attended him closely. He spoke to Huang Chao in a casual manner: “The parks, gardens, and city walls of Chang’an extend for nearly a hundred li. If external forces attack, we must have defenses ready; otherwise, holding the city will be difficult. I propose that from Wangxian Gate northward, encompassing Xuánwǔ and Báihǔ Gates, we build extensive walls and moats, erect watchtowers and battlements, and prepare defenses to repel attacks. This will ensure long-term security.” Huang Chao was pleased and rewarded him for his loyalty. He immediately ordered that two hundred thousand laborers be conscripted from the two wards, each to receive two sheng of rice and forty coins per day. The left and right armies were to provide four thousand piculs of rice and eight thousand strings of cash.\n\nOver a year later, the work remained unfinished, and the walls were not completed. The granaries of the Grand Storehouse were opened to feed the laborers, and later, elm bark was stripped to supply the imperial kitchens. The walls were never finished. Liu Wanyu, fearing the bandits would discover his scheme, fled to Heyang. He fell ill the following year and died.",

If goodness is not cultivated, no prayers or exorcisms can avert it.\"\n\nThus, though Chuqian would later speak of fortune and misfortune to others, he never performed rituals of exorcism or suppression. Later, he entered service in Shu as a minor general and was appointed Acting Minister of Works.\n\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll Two ends here.\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll Three begins.",

      "translated_text": "Deng Manyi was a master of the pipa, and the Music Bureau ranked him foremost among all musicians. Huang Chao grew rather intimate with him and, under the pretext of treating a wind-induced ailment, had his right hand seared with moxibustion, so that he could never play again. Though Huang Chao treated him with great generosity and never once asked him to take up his instrument and perform, every few days he would summon Deng into the palace and bestow upon him gold and silk. One day, Deng said to his friend: “I have heard that men of loyalty and integrity choose death and nothing more. I have been repeatedly pressed by this great bandit, yet I have never bent my principles to play for him. Today, when I am summoned, I shall go to my death and not return.” He bid farewell to his wife, daughter, and son. The messenger urged him onward, and so he entered to see Huang Chao. Huang Chao said to him with delight: “The musicians of the Music Bureau rank your artistry first among all, yet you have long claimed a wind-induced ailment. I have trusted and waited for you—could you not play just two or three notes on the pipa? You need not perform an entire piece.” Deng Manyi replied: “I was born to serve in the ranks of the crimson and purple, and all was bestowed upon me by the Son of Heaven of Tang. How could I bear to betray the grace of the former court and take this joy to delight another?” Huang Chao flew into a rage and ordered him beheaded, then slaughtered his entire family.\n\nZhaixing Hu’s younger brother was a skilled archer, never missing his mark. Huang Chao cherished him, dressed him in brocade robes, and always had him ride at the front of his procession. When the official troops seized Weiqiao, Huang Chao personally led his forces to resist them. Upon reaching the bridge, he ordered Zhaixing Hu’s brother to draw his bow and shoot. Though he loosed over ten arrows, all flew far but struck nothing. Huang Chao asked him: “Why do your arrows reach such distance yet hit nothing?” He replied: “The soldiers of the sagely Tang are either kin or comrades to me—how could I strike them?” Huang Chao grew enraged and killed him as well.",

      "translated_text": "The man of Zizhou, Yin Xuanzhi, had studied the Five Classics since youth and was especially proficient in the *Records of the Grand Historian*. When his father passed away, he built a hut by the grave and wept at the six canonical hours. Often, mountain dragons and tigers joined their roars to his wailing, and in time, even ghosts and spirits aided his lament. Each night, two lanterns would come to illuminate the grave, lingering until dawn. Later, when his mother died, he remained in mourning at her graveside for six years. Though his thatched hut collapsed, he never repaired it, dwelling instead in an earthen pit. Afflicted by a debilitating *qi* disorder, his waist and legs weakened, and his voice grew hoarse, yet he never tired of reciting and lecturing. He often told others: “To seek fame and office is not for myself. Both my parents are gone, and my salary could never have supported them—what use is reputation?” Thus, he never sat for the imperial examinations, enduring poverty all his life, and died at over eighty years of age.\n\nYang Taibo, also of Zizhou, at sixteen observed three years of mourning at his parents’ graves. Divine lanterns shone upon the tomb, fierce tigers grew docile, and a white hare appeared as a marvel. When the news reached the Chancellor of Shu, Wang Gong, he reported it to the throne, which issued an edict of praise and commendation, bestowing an honorary placard upon his gate.\n\nJulong Hongdao lived at the foot of Mount Zitong, south of Yanwu Pavilion. He built his mourning hut beside the official road, and though he lived past eighty, his hair grew over ten feet long. Upon each of his parents’ graves sprouted a single stalk of purple *lingzhi*, six or seven inches tall. Wild beasts grew tame in his presence, as if by custom.\n\nIn the *xinchou* year of the Guangming era, when Emperor Xizong fled to Shu, he personally visited Hongdao’s residence and sat upon a great stone in the courtyard. Hongdao later built a pavilion to shelter the stone. In the *yisi* year, when the imperial cortege returned, the emperor again visited, bestowing abundant gifts of money, silk, and clothing, as he had on the journey there. While the court resided in Jianzhou, an edict exempted Hongdao from taxes for three years and granted him an imperial banner in commendation.\n\nIn the section on *Ganying* (Responsive Manifestations):\nJiajiang Magistrate of Jiazhou, Zhu Bo, a *Jianxiao Gongbu Shangshu*, once fell ill while in office. His limbs became immobile, his entire body heavy and sluggish.

Another few days passed, and his mind became wild and restless, as if perceiving visions. Had his body not been so sluggish and immobile, he would have torn his hair and fled in madness, fearing nothing. Within ten days, four afflictions struck in succession, and the peril of his condition seemed to leave him but a day or two.\n\nExhausted from sleepless nights, at the point of utter fatigue, he drifted into a state between waking and sleep. There before him sat seven immortals, each no taller than five or six inches, their robes, caps, brows, eyes, beards, and hair all distinctly visible. Five sat in a row, while two sat crosswise at the sides. Zhu Bo thought to himself, *I am sitting upright—how can they sit crosswise?* Suddenly, he heard a voice from the empty air beside him respond: *\"As immortals, nothing is impossible. Why be surprised at crosswise seating?\"* The voice vanished, and so too did the seven immortals.\n\nFrom then on, he often felt as though hands grasped and manipulated his limbs, patting and rubbing his back and arms. His illness gradually lessened, and his insatiable thirst for cold water and hot drinks halved at once. Within three to five days, he could manage official duties and receive guests, his ailments fully healed. In gratitude, he had an image of the Seven True Persons of the Northern Dipper painted for veneration.\n\nDaoist Ritual Officer and Right Vice Director of the Imperial Secretariat Yin Guang fell ill in the third year of the Yongping era.

Often, he would try to dash about recklessly, requiring his entire household to restrain him. Soon, his limbs became paralyzed, his body heavy and sluggish. Each time he rose or sat, four or five attendants had to support him just to lean against a table.\n\nAfter several more months, his family, worn from constant vigil, suddenly saw an old man with white beard and temples, dressed in white, approach Yin Guang and say: *\"Your illness has taken effect—why not rise quickly?\"* He then lifted Yin Guang’s head, and at once, Yin Guang could sit up. Moments later, he rose on his own to trim the lamp and pour oil, then went to the bed to put on his shoes. Glancing around, he saw his servants all asleep and did not wish to wake them. Taking up a candle, he left the room, walked the entire residence, and then returned to his place. His household was astonished, and from that day, he fully recovered.\n\n*A Strange Dream*",

On the eighth day of the tenth month that year, the *wushen* day, he died at the age of sixty-one.\n\nIn the first month of the *xinchou* year of *Guangming*, Emperor Xizong’s imperial carriage had already reached the outskirts of Zuomian and Guoxian. The garrison commander, Ren Shi, was napping in the hall at midday when he suddenly dreamed a street patrol officer announced: *\"The Great General is coming to welcome the imperial carriage—you must await him by the roadside.\"* Ren rushed to the side of the thoroughfare, where thousands of cavalry and infantry were already marching due north. Their banners and ranks were extraordinarily disciplined, their weapons and armor magnificent, stretching over ten *li* without break. Countless armored warriors dragged their metal scales along the ground, while at the center rode a general on a white horse, crimson tassels adorning his golden armor, flanked by banners emblazoned with the sun and moon in five colors. Ren bowed deeply for the time it takes to eat two meals before the procession finally passed. He asked a messenger: *\"Who is the Great General?\"* The reply came: *\"General Li, who once resided behind the Fading Law Temple.\"* When Ren awoke, his body was drenched in sweat, and the vision remained vivid before his eyes. That year, I was ordered to perform rites at Qingcheng, where I recounted this event, and Guangting recorded it.\n\n*Record of Marvels, Volume Three concluded*\n*Record of Marvels, Volume Four*",

      "translated_text": "The Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, President of the Board of Revenue in the Department of State Affairs, Lord of Broad Achievement, Duke of Cai, Minister Du Guangting, having compiled accounts of spirits and gods, records:\n\nThe presented scholar Cui, traveling from the Guanzhong region to sit for the imperial examinations, was journeying early one morning more than ten *li* beyond Tong Pass. The fifth watch had just struck, and the road was deserted—only himself, a servant, a sedan-chair, and a donkey. Suddenly, he encountered a procession bearing torches in ranks, with banners, spears, and armor, some two hundred men strong, resembling the retinue of a commissioner. Cui concealed himself behind a locust tree until they passed, then continued on his way. Before he had gone two or three *li*, the same procession turned back. He hid again, then proceeded cautiously. Following behind was a sturdy foot soldier carrying a tea chest, moving slowly. Cui asked who they were, and the soldier replied: *\"This is the Marshal of the Sacred Peak, escorting the Celestial Official. The official’s surname is Cui, and he is called Attendant Gentleman, a candidate entering the Pass to sit for the examinations. Why not pay him a visit to divine your prospects?\"* Cui demurred, saying he had no means of introduction, but the soldier offered to inquire on his behalf.\n\nWhen they reached the temple gate, the sky had not yet brightened. The soldier instructed Cui to wait by the side of the gate while he took the tea chest inside. After a long while, he emerged and said: *\"The Attendant Gentleman will receive you.\"* He promptly led Cui inside, where they met with extraordinary delight. The Attendant Gentleman detained him in the guest quarters. Soon after, the Marshal of the Sacred Peak arrived, exchanged words, and invited the Attendant Gentleman into the temple. There, tents and banquet mats were arranged, and the entertainment—singing girls and musicians—was lavish. As music played and wine flowed, the Attendant Gentleman, preparing to attend the feast, ordered his attendants to serve Cui with all due courtesy, providing tea and whatever else he required, treating him with utmost warmth. After some time drinking, Cui grew weary and strolled about, unconsciously wandering out the gate. Suddenly, he saw his maternal uncle-by-marriage. They clasped hands and spoke of old times. The uncle’s complexion was gaunt, his clothes tattered and threadbare. He wept as he asked after Cui, who replied: *\"Uncle, it seems you departed the world of men long ago. How is it I meet you here?\"* The uncle answered: *\"I left the human realm fifteen years ago. I have yet to find a post, and recently became the spirit of Fu Shui Bridge. Weary of endless receptions and plagued by want of food and clothing, my straits are dire. I heard you were on good terms with the Celestial Official, the Attendant Gentleman, and as we share the same clan name, I thought you might recommend me. I have come to plead my case. If you could mention my name, and I were appointed a minor spirit of the Southern Mountains, I might at least escape hunger and poverty. Thereafter, I could be promoted to a celestial rank and leave this wretched underworld behind.\"* Cui replied that they had only just met and he did not know if a recommendation were possible, but he would try. With that, he returned to the Attendant Gentleman’s quarters, where the feast soon ended, and he took his leave.",

My official duties will soon be concluded, and I must return at once—the schedule is pressing, and I cannot linger long.\" Thereupon, Cui presented the request from his father-in-law. The Attendant Gentleman replied, \"A *zishen* post is akin to a hereditary office among men, a most refined position. The spirit of Fu Shui Bridge holds a low and miscellaneous rank—how could such an appointment be easily secured? Still, I shall try to mention it. The Mountain Spirit will surely not refuse.\" He then went to pay his respects to the Mountain Spirit, and Cui secretly drew near to listen. He heard every word of the request, and the Mountain Spirit indeed granted it. An edict was immediately issued for the appointment, and soon after, the new *zishen* received the document, bowed in gratitude, and was escorted away by a retinue of one or two hundred officials and attendants, all in perfect order.\n\nCui stepped outside to offer his congratulations. The *zishen*, moved to tears, said, \"Were it not for your intercession, I could never have attained this position. After my next promotion, I shall enter the celestial bureaucracy. This year, the Earth Spirit reported that the Wei River would overflow, and your estate was to be swept away, along with all the households upstream and downstream—some three to five hundred families. I have already been ordered to protect your land. By the fifth or sixth month, you will be spared this disaster, and I shall receive five hundred bolts of silk in gratitude.\"\n\nIn an instant, the *zishen* departed with his entourage, and the Attendant Gentleman also took leave of the Mountain Spirit, seeing Cui off. Alone in the temple, Cui felt as if waking from a dream. He stepped outside to seek his servants, who were still at the inn, having seen nothing. Thereupon, he did not re-enter the pass but returned instead to his villa. That summer, the Wei River did overflow, causing great destruction—only Cui’s estate was spared. Before the estate stood an empty boat; after the waters receded, it held five hundred bolts of silk. Cui was thus further convinced of the truth of the matter.

      "translated_text": "Lord Duan Wenchang of Zouping, a man of talent who scorned the vulgar, wandered destitute through Jing and Chu. Often half-drunk, he would stroll the streets of Jiangling in clogs, heedless of the mud after rain. Beside the road stood a grand residence, its gate fronting a flowing canal. Once, in his cups, he sat by the canal, removed his clogs, and washed his feet, utterly indifferent to onlookers. He declared, \"When I become Military Commissioner of Jiangling, I shall buy this house.\" Those who heard him covered their mouths and laughed. Yet within a few years, he was indeed appointed to govern Jiangnan, and he purchased the very residence.\n\nHe had once served as an aide to the Grand Marshal, Prince Nan Kang of the Wei clan, acting as a postal inspector in Chengdu. One day, falling out of favor, the prince dismissed him and assigned him to the minor post of magistrate of Lingchi. In haste, he accepted the commission, setting out with a frail servant and a feeble horse. Six or seven *li* from Lingchi, as dusk deepened and the road emptied of travelers, two torches suddenly appeared ahead, guiding him. A voice called out, \"The Grand Marshal approaches!\" As he reached the city gate, the torches vanished. He knocked for some time before the magistrate sent someone to admit him.\n\nLater, when the prince was dispatched to Chang’an on a mission, Lord Duan befriended Liu Yuxi, who then served as Vice Minister of Rites. One day, as Liu conversed with a diviner, Lord Duan arrived unexpectedly. The diviner hid behind a bamboo screen, and after Lord Duan departed, he emerged, telling Liu, \"If you seek promotion within the ministry, the prospects are distant—you must wait a decade. Only after this guest becomes chancellor will you be appointed Director of the Bureau of Rites.\" Thereafter, Liu fell into disfavor and was repeatedly assigned to provincial posts. A decade later, when Lord Duan became chancellor, Liu was indeed appointed Director of the Bureau of Rites and returned to the capital, just as the diviner had foretold.\n\nIn the summer of the *gengwu* year during the reign of the Shu court, heavy rains swelled the Min River, threatening to breach the Dujiangyan weir at the mouth of the Jing River. That night, voices and clamor arose from the weir, as if hundreds of men bearing countless torches had gathered. Amid a violent storm, the torchlight remained unquenched. By dawn, the great weir had shifted several hundred *zhang*, diverting the waters into the Xinjin River. The banners in Li Bing’s shrine were soaked. Huang Jing, the magistrate of Daojiang, and the garrison commander jointly reported the event. At the time, Xinjin, Jia, and Mei suffered severe flooding, yet the Jing River did not overflow.\n\nWhen Zheng Junxiong was prefect of Suizhou, one evening he suddenly saw what appeared to be thousands of soldiers and banners encamped within the water’s embrace. Flags, tents, and bustling figures resembled a marching army. Too fearful to investigate, he could not discern their origin. The prefecture was placed on sudden alert, but by dawn, when scouts were sent to reconnoiter, the army had vanished, leaving only three or five stragglers. When questioned, they replied, \"We are the river’s drowned spirits.\" Years later, unrest in the provincial capital forced its relocation to the Three Gorges, and peace was restored. Upon returning to the region, Zheng sent men to inspect the site, where traces of encampments and firelight remained, all verifiable.\n\nIn a village on the east bank of Suizhou, known as Tang Village, an ancient figure was once seen standing by the roadside—clad in flowing robes with wide sleeves and an archaic cap. He addressed the villagers, saying, \"I am Lord Zhongli, the Great King. My old temple, a thousand *li* downstream, was destroyed by floods. My statue has now drifted upstream and will soon arrive. Build me a temple here.\" The villagers searched the river and found a wooden effigy, several *chi* tall. They erected a temple at the site where the figure had appeared, naming it the Spirit of Tang Village. To this day, prayers for rain or drought there are never unanswered. Some say the figure’s initial appearance resembled that of a Daoist priest.\n\nIn Guangdu County stood the Temple of Pan’gu the Third Lord, renowned for its efficacy. Any who passed its gates without showing proper reverence would suffer immediate consequences—being struck or stumbling on the road. Thus, people near and far feared and respected it. A county resident named Yang Zhiyu, who had received the Register of Orthodox Unity and Alliance威, once returned home drunk one night. The road was long, the moon dark. Passing the temple gate, he cried out, \"I am a disciple of Orthodox Unity! Drunk and moonless, with no companion to guide me home, I beseech your divine power to light my way!\" Suddenly, a torch emerged from the temple gate, leading him forward. Over twenty *li*, through narrow bridges and winding paths, he did not stumble once. Upon reaching home, the torch vanished. The villagers were astonished.\n\nOutside the gate of the Temple of the True Lord, Envoy of the Nine Heavens, on Mount Lu, lay a stone smooth as polished jade, gleaming and immaculate. Those who gazed upon it often witnessed its numinous power. Anyone who defiled the temple would be seized by the spirit officials and beaten beside the stone. Once, a young servant from a scholar’s lodging nearby played upon the stone, sitting and even urinating on it several times. Soon after, a man named Liu Dun filed a complaint with the prefecture, accusing the boy. The prefect sent men to the temple to investigate, but they found only evidence of the boy’s mischief—no trace of Liu Dun’s residence before the temple. A Daoist master named Mao, lodging at the temple, mentioned that a certain official named Liu Dun had recently stayed there, describing him as refined and learned in antiquity. Though Mao had visited him, he knew not where he lived. \"He claimed the boy sat on his head and urinated on him,\" Mao mused. \"Perhaps it was this stone.\" They dug beneath it, and after three or four *chi*, uncovered a vast stone root. All marveled at its strangeness. A small pavilion was built, its windows screened with gauze to keep the stone pristine.\n\nYongqing County in Fangzhou lay a hundred and twenty *li* east of the prefectural seat, a mountainous and ruined district where the city walls stood desolate. During the reign of Emperor Muzong, Magistrate Sun arrived from the capital to take office. A year later, his younger brother Ning came to visit.

He came upon a desolate temple, its earthen idols arrayed in rows—a central deity seated, three women attending at his side. No gate, no plaque, no inscription revealed whose shrine it was. He inquired of the county officials, who replied only, \"The Great King of Yongqing.\"\n\nHis brother lingered there for a long while, unable to dispel his melancholy. He composed a poem on the wall, a plea and a lament. Soon after, he fell into a deep slumber and found himself in the god’s presence.\n\nThe god addressed him: \"My name and deeds have long been obscure. Though I have longed to recount my story, I feared being dismissed as some malevolent specter. Now that you have asked, I may at last express my long-held sincerity and vent my years of pent-up grievance.\n\nI am from Piling.

      "translated_text": "From the north of Xiang and Han to the south of Lan Pass, temples shaped in my likeness stand in over thirty places. This temple’s image, too, is but one of the many where I once rested. Over the years, the rites have endured, yet folk tradition has erred grievously, mistaking my shrine for that of the White Tiger Spirit. How far from the truth!\n\nFortunately, you, sir, have inquired and allowed me to recount the beginning and end, that I may make plain the facts and correct the falsehood. One day, when your younger brother speaks of this in Xiang, let the guests and retainers compile and inscribe the truth upon tablets in the temple. Dust and rain have worn away the characters, nearly erasing them. In the *Dazhong* year of *Renshen*, Wang Shicheng, the *Guanfeng* Judicial Officer of Xiangzhou, oversaw the subordinate commanderies. Struck by the account, he feared the wooden tablets would decay and errors spread, so he had the text engraved upon stone.\n\nThus, the *Sacrificial Canon* states: \"Those who ward off great disasters, defend against great calamities, and whose merit extends to the people shall be worshipped for generations.\" Lord Zhou inherited his father’s valor and received the Mandate of the Supreme Emperor. Within the four commanderies, his temples stand in abundance—his kindness to the people was vast, and his due offerings are fitting. Yet vulgar custom knows not the truth, mistakenly deeming them shrines to the White Tiger. Had it not been for the poems of Sun Sheng, which stirred the hidden spirit of Kuopu to respond, his divine merit would have remained obscure, and the distinction between true and false lost. Let those who come after read this carefully and take heed.\n\nIn Hezhou’s Bachuan County, after the military upheaval, the official residences lay in ruins. The authorities relocated to a stockade, where they could barely secure themselves. During Magistrate Cui’s tenure, a strong soldier stole and uprooted stockade timber. Captured and sent to the garrison, the commander had him executed. The soldier’s family had long worshipped the Wall Mountain Spirit. After his death, the spirit began to haunt the magistrate’s household. Sometimes it appeared in visible form, coming and going; other times, it cursed from the air, hurled fire and torches, and broke objects. Money, silk, and clothing vanished without cause. Though chests and boxes remained locked as before, the garments inside were often shredded. They sought rituals and exorcisms, but none could subdue it.\n\nWhen the magistrate left office and returned home a thousand *li* away, the haunting followed. Day and night, it ate and drank like a living person. The household served it without rest, expending great effort and wealth, nearly exhausting their resources. Then, one day, the entire family heard the sound of a great crow flapping its wings, descending near the roof and lingering. A voice boomed from the air: \"I have come!\" The whole household, young and old, welcomed and served it. The spirit called itself the Great King.\n\nIt said: \"You have suffered misfortune of late. My brothers from Yong Brook wronged you without cause, ruining your livelihood, destroying your possessions, and causing strange disturbances. I thought you must have feared them greatly—now I have sent them all away. Your misfortune is ended, and fortune begins. The Great King has come to stay, though not for long. For now, I shall rest in the Heavenly Canopy Shrine. This Heavenly Canopy is most excellent—I shall borrow it to copy a version in the heavens. In three to five days, I will return it.\"\n\nDays later, they placed the Heavenly Canopy high upon the eaves, and it remained undamaged. From then on, the spirit was often present, sometimes summoning the master of the house to converse. Suddenly, it would order the young and old to recite poetry or perform music, and they could sing along to every tune. If they misread a character in the text, it would correct them. In conversation, it often urged people to do good, to cultivate *qi* techniques and the Dao. It also claimed to ride a crane to and from the heavens as usual.\n\nAt first, a flock of cranes appeared in the town. The spirit said: \"Only two among them are true cranes—the ones I ride. The rest are common crows.\" It also revealed its surname was Zhang and ate and drank like a living person. It had a daughter named Brocade Maiden, as well as a wife and servants, consuming no small amount of food. Generally, it would speak to good and virtuous people but refused to engage with the violent or wicked. It also mentioned: \"When I go to heaven, three drunken monks and soldiers once came to visit, speaking coarsely and insulting me. I ignored them. After the monk left, I told the household: 'That monk eats dog meat, drinks wine, and is violent and immoral. I did not wish to speak with him.'\"\n\nYet it knew clearly the good and evil deeds of people, their fortunes and misfortunes, blessings and calamities, and its words never missed the mark. It even knew their names and actions in detail. If questioned closely, it would deflect with other answers. What manner of spirit it was remains unknown.\n\nIn the early *Yongping* era, there was a monk named Huijin of the Wang clan who resided at Fugan Temple. One morning, as he left for Zifu Monastery, he saw a tall figure with an indigo-colored body pursuing him relentlessly. He fled to escape, reaching Bamboo Basket Bridge, where he dashed into a civilian’s home. The figure followed, seizing and dragging him with irresistible force. The monk wailed and pleaded. The figure asked: \"What is your surname?\" The monk replied: \"Wang.\" The figure said: \"Same surname, different given name,\" and released him.\n\nTrembling, the monk took refuge in the household. After some time, he calmed and returned to the temple. That very night, another man with the same surname but a different given name died.\n\n*Record of Marvels*, Volume Four—end.\n*Record of Marvels*, Volume Five.",

      "translated_text": "The common saying goes: \"To enter the Dragon Palace is to attain the rank of Water Immortal.\"\n\nLiu Junqing, styled Sun, served as a military aide (*yaya*) in Qingcheng Garrison during the *Qianfu* era. The regional commander was deeply devoted to virtue, often administering medicine and stone needles to cure the ailments of the poor. He personally attended to them, comforting and tending to both soldiers and common folk with tireless diligence. Diligent in his duties and sincere in his dealings, he was held in high esteem by his contemporaries. He possessed a pearl, large as a ball, said to have been passed down by his ancestors through generations as a treasured heirloom. When held to the light, it revealed the forms of objects in perfect detail—every hair and hue clearly visible—though all appeared inverted.\n\nAt that time, the rebel leader Han Zhu of Jinyuan seized Qingcheng and its surrounding market towns. Liu, as garrison commander, led his troops to relieve Taobu Garrison but was encircled by the rebels. Though his thirty-odd elite soldiers fought against hundreds, their strength was unequal. As defeat loomed, a dozen or so infantrymen shielded Liu and attempted to break through the siege, but to no avail. He perished at the hands of the rebels, and all who heard of it grieved deeply.\n\nIn Dangyang County of Jingzhou, a mountain leans over a ravine, within which lies the well of Liu Wenlong, exceedingly deep. A dragon’s lair lies within, its side passages extending an unknown distance. Before fair weather or rain, clouds and mist often rise from the well. During the *Guanghua* era, a Daoist claiming to hail from Mount Shang entered the well to retrieve dragon’s lair soil and medicinal herbs before departing.\n\nLater, a magistrate named Huang Xun took office. He frequently rode his horse near the well, allowing filth and waste to flow into it. When reproached, he offered excuses. Within a year, both he and his horse went blind.\n\nIn the *Gengwu* year of Shu, Wang Zonglang, Prefect of Jinzhou, memorialized: \"By the Xun River in Xunyang County stands the Temple of Azure Mist. For several days, smoke and clouds shrouded its roof in gloom, and music resounded day and night. Suddenly, one day, the waters surged, and a host of dragons emerged upon the surface, moving toward the Han River. The largest measured several *zhang*, the smallest over a *zhang*. Some were yellow, others black, red, white, or green—some resembling oxen, horses, donkeys, or sheep. Fifty in all, they advanced in ranks into the Han River, then circled back toward the temple, weaving in and out of sight for several *li* before vanishing after three days.\"\n\nIn the *Guiyou* year, in the fields of Xipu, a small dragon, dark green in color, was split in two. Within ten days, it rotted and disappeared.\n\nMoha Pond, west of the grand hall, also contains a dragon well. It is highly sacred, and none dare offend it. Within an ancient well in the Chengdu Academy’s Wuhou Residence, south of the Smoky Terrace, fish six or seven *cun* long often swim near the surface, causing the water to surge. It is said the well harbors a dragon.\n\nIn Yihu, at the border of Jianmen, Yichang, and Jiaguan along the Jialing River in Jianzhou, a woman of fifty appeared. She called herself the Eighteenth Aunt and frequently visited households, though she neither ate nor drank. She often admonished people: \"Do only good deeds, never defy the principles of the gods.

      "translated_text": "A merchant moored his boat on the Bian River and caught a giant turtle, which he roasted in the stove’s embers. That evening, he forgot to remove it. The next day, when he went to retrieve it, the shell was already charred. Brushing off the ashes, he placed it on the dining table to serve with his meal. After a long while, the turtle stretched its neck and moved its legs, crawling slowly across the table as if fully alive. All who saw it marveled. He cast it back into the water, where it swam away.\n\nDownstream from Xuanzhou, on the western bank near Caishi Mountain, lies West Liang Mountain, facing East Liang across the water. The residents of West Liang make their living by catching turtles, removing their shells while still alive to sell for pyromantic divination. After stripping the shells, they discard both flesh and carapace into the water—yet the creatures still move. Some say the shells regrow, and they harvest them year after year, supplying an endless market. Yet the turtles of this mountain never seem to diminish. All the divination turtles in the world come from here, though none knows why.\n\nIn the third year of Wude under Emperor Gaozu of Tang, Lord Lao appeared on Yangjiao Mountain. The Prince of Qin sent Ji Shanxing to report the vision. Shanxing told Lord Lao: *\"Entering the capital will be difficult—there must be some proof.\"* Lord Lao replied: *\"On the day you arrive, someone will present a stone resembling a turtle. Let that be your sign.\"* When Shanxing reached the palace gates, indeed, someone from Shaozhou offered a turtle-shaped stone, inscribed on its underside with six characters: *\"The realm at peace, for ten thousand days.\"*\n\nAt the end of the Wude era, when Emperor Taizong quelled the internal strife, a white turtle was seen swimming upon a lotus leaf in the palace pond. Taizong took it in hand, and it transformed into a white stone, lustrous as jade. After ascending the throne, he issued an edict: *\"Heaven, in its favor, bestows upon us this sacred turtle.\"*\n\nIn the *dingmao* year of the Huichang era in Shu, four turtles, each two or three inches long, emerged from a hole in the moat’s embankment near the temple city. Their backs bore golden inscriptions: *\"King\"* and *\"Great Auspice.\"*\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the first year of Qiande under the Shu emperor (*gengchen* day, the birthday of the Broadly Sagely One), Wang Yanhui, the garrison commander of Pengkou Town, presented a white turtle found in the Palace of Master Luo.\n\nIn Changsha County, during the first year of Taishi under Emperor Wu of the Eastern Jin, a divine turtle of dazzling whiteness, four or five *chi* in length, emerged from the water and circled the shore. The pond was thus named *Guītáng* (Turtle Pond), and the fertile fields below it spanned over a hundred *qing*.\n\n---\n\n**Strange Softshell Turtles**\nThe *yuan* resembles the *ao*, but those with red bellies are *yuan*, while white-bellied ones are *ao*. Common lore holds that the *yuan*’s body has twelve segments of flesh. When fishermen catch one, fearing its harm, they pierce it with hooks and sharp blades. Yet even when hacked apart with long-handled axes, its limbs severed and body dismembered, so long as the pieces are not cast into boiling water, they continue to writhe and flee. Even the largest *ao* or *yuan*, if bitten by mosquitoes or gnats, will die within a night.\n\nA man on the Shu River once caught an enormous *ao*, larger than usual, over a *chi* in length, its skirt crimson. He boiled it in a pot, and after a full night, it still swam and played as before. He stoked the fire further, and though the water boiled away, the *ao* did not die. Terrified, the household took it for a dragon’s omen. They cast it back into the river, where it floated away, never to be seen again.\n\n---\n\n**Strange Serpents**\nIn the region of Jianli, there are serpents three *chi* long, as thick as a vat, or at least as stout as a pillar. They have rabbit heads and snake bodies, with white markings beneath their necks. When they seek to harm a person, they emerge from the mountains, rolling downhill to strike travelers, burrowing into their armpits to drink their blood. These are called *bǎn-bí* (Slope-Noses). They hide in burrows, poking out only their snouts to bellow—a sound like an ox’s lowing, audible for miles, shaking the earth. When farmers burn their fields in winter, they sometimes burn these serpents to death, though they yield only fat.\n\nDuring the Qianfu era, at the Divine Immortal Post Station, a giant black serpent, over thirty *zhang* tall, was seen. Accompanying it were hundreds of smaller serpents, some as thick as rafters, others like five- or ten-*dan* jars. They slithered in formation from east to west, a procession of travelers. From dawn until dusk, they passed, their length stretching for miles. As the last of them went by, a small child stood atop the serpent’s tail, waving a red banner and dancing as he went. That year, Yang Shouliang, the military governor of Shannan, was defeated.\n\nIn the South Sea, there is a mountain tens of *li* high, a hundred *li* in circumference. Every summer, a giant serpent coils around it three or four times, drinking from the sea—this is its custom. One day, as it drank, an even larger serpent emerged from the sea and swallowed the fish. The sky darkened, and for a long time, neither was seen again.\n\nThe *Jīguānshé* (Cock’s-Crest Serpent) has a head like a rooster, complete with a comb. Its body is over a *chi* long and several *cun* in girth. Its bite is fatal. It is found at the foot of Mount Kuaiji.\n\nThe *Bàoshēnshé* (Exploding-Body Serpent) is one or two *chi* long, gray as ash. When it hears people passing, it flies from the forest like a withered branch, striking them sideways. Those it hits invariably die.\n\nThe *Huánghànshé* (Yellow-Cheeked Serpent) is one or two *chi* long, golden as yellow metal. It dwells in rock crevices and, when rain is coming, makes a sound like an ox’s bellow. Its bite is also fatal. It is found on Siming Mountain.\n\nIn Pixian County, a villager found a small serpent by the canal on the southern outskirts, over a *chi* long. He gutted it, skewered its body, and roasted it over smoke and fire. Days later, his young child suddenly swelled red all over, its skin blistering and bursting. The child wailed in agony, then spoke: *\"Your family killed me without cause, disemboweling me and roasting me over fire. Now let your child know this pain.\"* The family, horrified, retrieved the serpent’s remains, removed the bamboo skewer, sprinkled them with water, burned incense, and prayed in apology. They returned the remains to the place where it had been found.",
      "overlap_context": " life preserved by this turtle, but the people of the south have been forever freed from venomous creatures. The lives saved are beyond count—all by Your Majesty’s virtue and the power of this divine turtle.\"*\n\nIn the third year of Wucheng, on the *gengwu* day of the sixth month (the *guihai* day), Meng Yanhui, Governor of Guanghan, memorialized that a golden turtle, an inch in diameter, had been seen swimming upon a lotus leaf in West Lake. He had a painting made and submitted it to the throne.",

Beyond it, past the Tongguan Township and more than twenty *li* into the valley, there are two caves: one called the Eastern Women’s Study, the other the Western Women’s Study.\n\nThe Eastern Women’s Study is set in sheer cliffs, its entrance high upon the rock face, unreachable by climbing. At night, the sound of reading often drifts from within.\n\nThe Western Women’s Study is accessible by a path winding along the mountainside. Near its entrance stands a stone chamber, large enough to hold ten or twenty people. The cave mouth is sometimes occupied by figures holding torches, and one may enter. After traveling ten or twenty *li*, the passage splits into five doors on either side, each bearing inscriptions. Some lead to Penglai and other immortal realms.\n\nIn recent years, a rockfall has blocked the entrance, preventing entry.\n\nAtop the mountain is a sky-well, plunging straight down some two *zhang*. A natural stone slab juts out from its side, and beneath it, the well extends another two *zhang* or more, allowing passage. At the bottom, a niche with winding steps ascends broadly. Inside the niche lie tens of thousands of Daoist scriptures, all stored on beds of catalpa wood. A stone figure sits there, head bowed, hands resting on its knees, lifelike in appearance.\n\nAt the bottom of the sky-well lie countless bamboo slips, cast down by Daoist adepts—rotted and piled beyond counting.\n\nDuring the *Dashun* era, a Daoist practitioner from Fuping named Xu the Seventh once retrieved the *Scripture on Nurturing Life* from the cave and disseminated it. Later, a copy was returned to the mountain.\n\nProceeding north another twenty *li* or so, three springs emerge in the valley. A stone ledge there can shelter two or three hundred people. Within the valley lie three stone basins, each over a *zhang* wide, their surfaces smooth and unmarred by human craft. The basins brim with water from the springs, the excess flowing beyond the mountain.\n\nElders say immortals once bathed in these basins. Most who trespass upon this mountain are struck by thunder and hail, damaging crops. Thus, locals conceal their tracks, making the site difficult to find.\n\nThe mountain abounds with traces of immortals and contests of sagely power. Before the Eastern Women’s Study stands a nest of divine roc, guarding the cave entrance. Those who intrude are struck down by the roc, perishing instantly.\n\nLong ago, a Daoist adept carved five stone figures and placed them on the mountain. A farmer hoeing his crops was startled by the roc and fled beneath one of the stone figures, placing his bamboo hat upon its head. The roc struck the hat, breaking the stone figure’s head—its remains are still visible today.\n\nBelow the mountain, in Tongguan Township, many bear the surname Gongsun. On Jiashan, in Shibao Village, most are surnamed Wen or Ma.\n\nThe Maigu Cave on Fanyang Mountain is also known as the First Yangping of the Twenty-Four Transformations. It lies on the sunny side of the Fan River, from which it takes its name.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Original Boundary* states that Celestial Master Zhang Daoling once traveled here, and the Most High preached scriptures in this place. It is located south of Xindu County in Chengdu Prefecture, fifteen *li* across the river, where a range of mountains culminates in a solitary peak.\n\nDuring the *Guanghua* era, in the second year, the *jichou* day of the fifth month (5 June 899), as Emperor Zhenwu was ascending the dragon, the mountain’s earth crumbled, and the cave entrance opened of its own accord. Yang Jing, an official from Shikang Township, and the Daoist Zhang Shouzhen reported the matter to the prefecture, stating that after the cave opened, villagers came and went daily.\n\nThe prefecture dispatched the county clerk Yang Ze, the painter Ren Cong, and Zhang Shouzhen to inspect and map the site. Their report described entering the cave with torches:\n\nThe first door faces north, two *chi* high and three *chi* five *cun* wide. Proceeding to the second door, about five *chi* in, the second cave entrance measures one *chi* six *cun* square. Beyond lies darkness. The passage is one *zhang* two *chi* long and six *chi* wide, with two stone niches on the eastern side and two cave entrances to the southwest.\n\nOne southern passage is one *chi* six *cun* in diameter. Inside, it extends one *zhang* two *chi* long, one *zhang* wide, and four *chi* high, with three stone niches on the southern side.\n\nThe two western passages lead to connecting doors, each one *zhang* seven *chi* in diameter. Inside, they are five *chi* wide and six *chi* high, with a *zhang* between the doors. There is a chamber five *chi* high and four *chi* wide.\n\nWithin, stone carvings of *dou* and *gong* brackets, tiles, and bowls are arranged like a mountain. The characters for \"sun\" and \"moon\" are inscribed, along with a partitioned room one *chi* five *cun* high and two *chi* five *cun* wide.\n\nA stone *ao* (mythical turtle) stands one *chi* high and one *chi* five *cun* wide, with a door five *cun* wide. Three stone niches, each seven *chi* wide, are present.\n\nFurther west, a cave entrance one *chi* seven *cun* in diameter bends toward the southern door. A chamber six *chi* high and four *chi* wide lies beyond. Inside, stone *dou* and *gong* brackets, tiles, and two *ao* models share a bed one *chi* high and two *chi* three *cun* wide. The door is eight *chi* wide, with stone *dou* brackets.\n\nIn the northwest corner is another door, one *chi* six *cun* square. Inside, the space measures two *zhang* or more, with niches on the southern, western, and northern sides. In the southern corner, another cave entrance, one *chi* six *cun* in diameter, emits black vapor when approached with a torch, extinguishing the flame and preventing further entry.\n\nThe cave connects to the main Fanyang Mountain, about three *li* distant.\n\nAccording to a petition from the local villagers, including Zhang Zan of the Zhang clan, Fanyang is an ancient site. The mountain is regularly propitiated with sacrifices, and the cave has existed since antiquity, though it often seals itself. During the *Yuanhe* era, when Wei Gao, Prince of Nankang, was governing Shu, the cave suddenly opened. The people all said: \"When the cave door opens, the year will be abundant and goods plentiful.\"",

Stalactites coil upward like arms or fingers; when illuminated by torchlight, they gleam translucent, snapping brittle at the slightest bend.\n\nEmerging from the cave mouth, all is transformed by the wind into white stone.\n\nThirty or forty paces from the dais, lotus blossoms carpet the ground in every direction. Nearby flows a sweet spring, its waters warm and pale; those who explore the cave brew tea here. Ahead lies a transverse stream, its rapids swift and roaring, rushing out beyond the cave. Over the stream spans a bridge, some two or three *zhang* long and a *zhang* wide, neither of stone nor earth, yet of grand and sturdy craftsmanship.\n\nCrossing the bridge, one reaches a yellow earthen slope, four or five *zhang* high, its path treacherous and slick; travelers pause to catch their breath before reaching the summit. Atop the slope stands a vast hall, its four walls smooth and level, its center soaring several *zhang* high. On the walls, visitors have inscribed their names and the dates of their journeys. At the farthest corner of the hall, a recess appears, four or five *chi* high and three or four *chi* wide, suspended over a *zhang*-deep drop, beyond reach of climbers.\n\nLegend tells of a traveler who once scaled the green vines to enter; after months, he emerged in the caves of Mount Wu. Since then, none have dared follow.\n\nSeventy *li* west of Qifu lies Longzhou, where the Fish-Dragon Cave may be found. Within, stones of varying sizes drift out with the water.

The two cliffs stand apart by over a hundred *zhang*, their ascent perilous and inaccessible to all.\n\nAtop the peak stand the Heavenly Worthy and an ancient palace, their dates of construction unknown. Immortal adepts once strung a rope bridge to traverse it, but the cables have long since rotted away with the passage of years. A local saying goes: *\"He who would repair and renew it will find hair growing beneath his feet.\"* Such has been the tradition for ages.\n\nDuring the Xiantong era, a Daoist named Mao Yihuan, a native of the mountain’s foothills, took up the Way in his youth. He ceaselessly recited the *Five Thousand Characters*, wore tattered hempen robes, and daily chanted scriptures in the marketplace, begging for wine before ascending the mountain in a drunken state. Scaling sheer cliffs and perilous heights, he treated the impassable as a bridge.

      "translated_text": "Midway across, the bridge swayed and threatened to plunge into the abyss below—its depths unfathomable, none dared look down. After several years, the ropes rotted and the bridge collapsed, with no one to repair it.\n\nIn the *renchen* year of the Xiantong era, while performing a mountain sacrifice with guests on the western peak, Mao the Master was away on his travels. Someone told the magistrate: \"Beside this peak lies a narrow path, clinging to the cliffside, barely passable—no handholds for travelers. Yet Master Mao often ventured there, disappearing for over ten days before reemerging.\" The magistrate suspected he hid in a cave. Among the guests was Guo Toutui of Guangling, whom the magistrate asked to follow the path and investigate. After a long while, Toutui returned, shaken and speechless, then recounted: \"The path extends some thirty *zhang* or more before reaching a cave. Its mouth spans only three to five *chi*; descending, one finds level ground hundreds of *chi* below. The cave can seat over ten people. Inside stands a massive wooden chest, sealed with sturdy locks. This was where Master Mao read his scriptures—the stone surface is smooth, bearing the marks of knees and feet, with scrolls still resting there. But Master Mao himself was nowhere to be found. His household consists only of a wife and daughter, so it is suspected he attained the Dao.\"\n\nMaster Mao often carried a bowl with a lamp to cross the rope bridge. The mountain’s residents grew accustomed to the sight. The mountain teemed with venomous snakes and fierce tigers, so locals never dared venture alone. Yet when Mao returned at night, he showed no fear. Two crows always accompanied him; when guests were about to arrive, the crows would take flight and cry out. Mao would then prepare the seating for visitors, and before he finished, the guests would indeed arrive.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the seventh month in the *renzi* year, at Ghost City Mountain in Qingcheng, heavy rains caused cliffs to collapse, and a sudden torrent surged forth behind the Temple of the Venerable One, rising over a hundred *zhang* high. The temple hall stood directly in its path, threatened with destruction. Suddenly, a boulder fell like a dam, diverting the water eastward and sparing the hall from ruin. The temple had long relied on fetching water from the stream for daily use, a laborious task. From the source of the flood, a spring now flowed directly into the kitchen, its water sweet and fragrant, never ceasing in winter or summer.\n\nEast Pillar and West Pillar lie north of Jinzhou and south of Qianyuan, over sixty *li* away. The name derives from the connected mountains, their peaks striking and unusual. Locals say: \"A mountain comes from the south, and to its north stands a massive stone pillar. The mountain passes through the pillar, hence the name.\" Further east rise several sheer peaks, one towering above the rest, said to be where Master Pu ascended. Below Master Pu’s peak, near the cliff and in the ravine, lie stone slabs inscribed with seal script—six or seven sites in all. Few can decipher them, though they may still be found.\n\nFlame Sun Cave, as passed down by elders, lies atop Yang Mountain in Lingzhou. Hidden since ancient times, none knew its location. On the sixteenth day of the first month in the third year of the Qiande era (*xinsi* year), during the *gui-mao* night, the Well Inspector, Protector Ma Quanzhang, and the Military Commissioner, Grand Guardian Ma, dreamed of a man clad in purple robes with a sash, his tall hat and ancient attire resembling a Daoist. The man bowed and led them to a cliffside, saying: \"This is Flame Sun Cave. Sealed for many years, if you open and protect it, it will bring fortune to the state.\" He pointed to a nearby path, recently opened, and urged them to block it to prevent commoners from trampling the site. Then he departed.\n\nAt dawn, Quanzhang searched the area and found the earth slightly sunken. Probing with a staff, he discovered depths beyond measure. He ordered Hou Guangzhi, a military officer, to assemble laborers for excavation. Gradually, traces emerged, and as they dug, three stone gates appeared. Inside, only fine sand remained—no insects, no other creatures. The cave ran east to west, twenty-nine *chi* deep and five *chi* three *cun* wide. The entire cave was hewn from stone.\n\nThe first gate stood six *chi* high and five *chi* two *cun* wide. The second gate was five *chi* five *cun* high and three *chi* seven *cun* wide. The third gate measured four *chi* seven *cun* high and three *chi* five *cun* wide. From the third gate inward, the height remained a uniform six *chi* one *cun*. The three gates stood only three to four *chi* apart, their carving so exquisite it seemed beyond human craft.\n\nWithin the third gate, on the southern side, was a stone chamber seven *chi* four *cun* wide, four *chi* eight *cun* high, and four *chi* two *cun* deep. Behind it lay another small cave, its entrance concealed by a slab of stone. A narrow crevice allowed light to reveal depths unknown. On the northern side was another chamber, four *chi* two *cun* deep, seven *chi* three *cun* wide, and five *chi* high, containing a stone bed. A smaller western chamber measured two *chi* deep, three *chi* five *cun* wide, and three *chi* one *cun* high. The northwestern stone bed was three *chi* eight *cun* long and two *chi* eight *cun* wide. A stone stove in the northwest corner spanned two *chi* three *cun* in length, with a seven-*cun* lintel. The stove was eight *cun* deep and three *chi* five *cun* in circumference.\n\nFrom the cave’s entrance eastward to the sacred well, the distance measured forty-one *zhang* eight *chi*.

      "translated_text": "Du Zhangzhao summoned the supervisor of the sacred well, the chief Daoist master of the Heavenly Master’s Institute, and the eminent *daode* priest Fei Shengzhen for consultation. They stated: \"The Heavenly Master’s Institute currently possesses the *Stele of the Heavenly Master’s Sacred Virtue*, inscribed by Prefect Li Zhengqing during the Yuanhe era, which records: 'In the second year of Jian’an of the Eastern Han, Heavenly Master Zhang journeyed from Pei to Shu, determining Qian as its astrological division. Observing the *qi* and appearance of Yang Mountain, he pointed to his disciples and said: Beneath this mountain lies a salt spring.' Now, upon examining this cave, we find it precisely above the well—this is indeed the Flame-Yang Cave.\"\n\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll Six, compiled by Minister of Works, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, Grand Master of Splendid Happiness, and Duke of Cai, the臣 Du Guangting.\n\n**Strange Waters**\n\n**Yiyang County** lies within the borders of Changsha Prefecture. Established during the Qin dynasty, its name remains unchanged to this day. The *Treatise on Geography* states: \"The Yi River flows along its southern side,\" though its existence is now unrecorded. To the north, it borders the Kui River, whose source lies in the boundaries of Shaoling and Wugang Counties, flowing northeast into Dongting County. Gazing eastward, one may at times discern the city walls of Changsha, along with the forms and colors of people and horses, all distinctly visible. Whether at dawn or midday, the vision lingers for hours before gradually fading. Though the county lies a direct three hundred *li* from Changsha, separated by towering mountains, and thus logically beyond sight, could this be the numinous manifestation of mountains and spirits? A local saying goes: \"Changsha and Yiyang, sealed in the same moment.\" In the first year of Zhongyuan during the reign of Emperor Guangwu, when he sealed Mount Tai and performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices at Liangfu, the mountain spirits manifested palaces on that very day. When the First Emperor of Qin dispatched the fangshi Xu Fu to sail the seas in search of elixirs, he glimpsed amid the waves the foundations of Han palaces and towers, their forms vivid and distinct, complete with the estates of nobles and officials. When Ban Chao resided in Hunye, at dawn amid radiant clouds, he saw celestial palaces arrayed in the distance, with attendants and ministers—all in the style of the Han. Such phenomena defy precise explanation.\n\nOne hundred and twenty *li* west of Xinkang County lies Qingtan, a deep pool in Zhangpu Stream, where a white dragon is said to dwell. During droughts, locals cast sheep dung into the pool, and soon after, torrential rains and floods arise—an effect still witnessed today.\n\nAt the head of the Qiantang River’s tide, when Wu Zixu repeatedly remonstrated with the King of Wu and was executed for defying his decree, he was dismembered by sword before death. His final words to his son were: \"Hang my head at the southern gate to witness the arrival of Yue’s armies. Wrap my body in fish skin and cast it into the river, so that I may ride the tides morning and evening to witness Wu’s downfall.\" Since then, the tide surges from Haimen Mountain, rising hundreds of feet high, crossing Qiantang and passing Yupu before gradually subsiding. It comes twice daily, its roar thunderous, like lightning and galloping horses, audible for over a hundred *li*. At times, Zixu is seen riding a white horse and a plain carriage amid the tide, prompting the construction of a temple in his honor. On the banks of the Sha River within Luzhou City stands another temple to Zixu. Each morning and evening, when the tide rises, the river’s waters surge and swell, reaching a height of one *chi* and a width of over ten *zhang* before the temple, subsiding after the time it takes to eat a meal. The locals say it responds to the Qiantang tide.\n\nDuring the Jinglong era of Emperor Zhongzong, along the four hundred *li* of official roads west of Luoyang, the land appeared as a watery reflection. People, horses, and trees were visible as if standing upon it, their shadows clear enough to view from above. The phenomenon lasted over a month before vanishing.\n\nBeneath Zhaotan Mountain lies a frigid spring, its depths unfathomable, known as Zhaotan. A proverb says: \"Zhaotan has no bottom; Orange Isle floats above.\" Long ago, a man capsized here, sinking his copper pot, which bore an inscription. Later, it was recovered in Dongting Lake, suggesting an underground passage connects them. Within the Xiang River’s embrace lies a stone bed, upon which rests a stone coffin with a seamless lid, its color like polished bronze—its origins unknown.\n\nSeventy *li* southwest of Mount Lu stands Yongquan Abbey. Long ago, the Supreme Perfected Immortal Ge Xuan refined elixirs here, and in response, a spring gushed from a stone crevice, flowing over a hundred *li* into Xunyang Lake, irrigating vast fields. The area was once plagued by leeches, tormenting farmers, until the Immortal inscribed a talisman beneath the cave’s entrance. When water washed over it, the leech infestation vanished wherever the water flowed, benefiting nearby and distant lands alike. Later, the talisman was carved and moved to Yongquan Abbey, though its original site remains, its efficacy undiminished.\n\nIn Chizhou Prefecture, the Red River harbors a surging spring, its five or six veins welling from the mountainside to form a great pool. Flowing two or three hundred paces, it cascades over rocky steps into a vast stream.\n\nThe Medicinal Spring lies forty *li* west of Fangzhou, within the pavilion of the Nine-Chamber Palace. The palace’s grand foundations rest upon a massive boulder, with only the Medicinal Spring—a two-*chi*-wide earthen well—visible. Digging three or four *chi* deep reveals mere inches of water, neither depleting nor overflowing. Elders recount that two magpies once nested upon twin trees, drinking from this spring. Locals who drank its waters found their ailments cured, and blades tempered in it became twice as sharp as usual—hence its name. The twin trees flanking the well still stand today. During the Wei and Zhou dynasties, an imperial decree ordered the construction of palaces here, as the mountain housed nine grottoes of immortals, thus naming it the Nine-Chamber Palace. Five *li* north of the palace lies Tangkou Village, where once stood a hot spring with splendid halls. The people of the prefecture bathed here. When the Prince of Luling governed the region, his young daughter bathed in the spring and perished from an epidemic. Thereafter, the hot spring dried up, leaving only barren land. After the girl’s death, she appeared in a secret dream to her father, saying: \"Beneath the spring lies a dark cavern. I beg you to place a lamp there to illuminate it.\"",

Today, they have all vanished, leaving no trace of their former site—only the name Tangkou Village remains.\n\nThirty *li* northwest of Qingcheng County lies the Temple of the Supreme Lord Lao. To the east of its gates, a spring called Horse-Hoof Spring flows. Its water is sweet and never ceases, icy cold in spring and summer, warm in autumn and winter. This was the place where the Supreme Lord Lao and the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign met to commune with the Dao. The spring was formed when the horse ridden by the Supreme Lord stamped its hoof into the earth.\n\nSix-Times Water:\nTwo *li* south of the Zongxuan Temple on Mount Qingcheng, a sheer cliff rises over five hundred *chi*, facing the temple. At its summit lies the Altar of Dao Transmission, where Lord Xiao of the Night once bestowed the Dao upon the Yellow Emperor. At the base of the ravine stands a stone niche. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, a divine effigy was enshrined there, and every day at the six *shi* hours, water would naturally flow from the cliff—an unceasing phenomenon still witnessed by pilgrims today.\n\n**Wondrous Stones**\nDuring the reign of Emperor Yao, five treasures descended from heaven. The first was the essence of earth, which fell at the foot of Gucheng Mountain. It transformed into the Old Man of the Ruined Bridge, who bestowed a military treatise upon Zhang Liang, saying, \"Read this, and you shall become the teacher of emperors and kings. Later, seek me beneath Gucheng Mountain—there, a yellow stone awaits.\" When Zhang Liang aided the Han and his work was done, he searched beneath Gucheng Mountain and indeed found the yellow stone. After Zhang Liang retired to Mount Shang to study the Dao with the Four White-Haired Ones, his family buried his robes and cap alongside the yellow stone. In ancient times, a yellow *qi* was often seen rising from the tomb, towering several *zhang* high. Later, the Red Eyebrows rebels exhumed the grave, but no corpse was found, and the yellow stone had vanished—its *qi* forever extinguished.\n\nThe essence of Jupiter fell upon Mount Jing, where it transformed into jade. Viewed from the side, it appeared green; viewed head-on, it was white. Bian He discovered it and presented it to the King of Chu. Later, it passed into Zhao and was offered to the First Emperor of Qin, who unified the realm and carved it into the Seal of Longevity. Li Si inscribed its surface in small seal script, and it was passed down through the ages as the Imperial Heirloom. Some ancient and modern accounts differ, claiming it was the essence of the Great Horn Star—also known as Jupiter.\n\nThe essence of Mars fell into the South Sea, becoming a great pearl over a *chi* in diameter. At times, it would rise from the waves, its light illuminating hundreds of *li* of sea and sky with a crimson glow. The place is now called Pearl Pond or Pearl Cliff, and the pearl still appears occasionally.\n\nThe essence of Venus fell west of Guifeng Peak on Mount Zhongnan, which is why the mountain is named Mount Taibai. The essence transformed into a white stone, resembling fine jade, often veiled in purple *qi*. During the Tianbao era, Emperor Xuanzong built the Temple of the Mysterious Origin in the Daning Ward of Chang’an, on the site of his former residence in Linzi, intending to commission a statue of the Mysterious Origin. In a dream, a divine being told him: \"In the northern valley of Mount Taibai lies a jade stone—retrieve and carve it. The place where the purple *qi* appears is where it rests.\" The next day, the emperor sent envoys into the valley to search. Locals reported that for ten days, a purple *qi* had lingered, unscattered. They dug at the site and recovered the jade stone, which was carved into a statue of the Mysterious Origin over two *zhang* tall. Two Perfected Ones, two attendants, and likenesses of Li Linfu and Chen Xilie—each over six *chi* in height—were also fashioned.\n\nThe essence of Mercury fell into Willow Valley in Zhangye Commandery, transforming into a black stone over a *zhang* wide and three *chi* high. By the end of the Later Han, faint patterns began to emerge upon it, though they were not yet distinct.",

      "translated_text": "During the Qinglong era of the Wei, a sudden thunderclap resounded for over a hundred *li*, and the stone stood upright of its own accord. White patterns emerged upon it, depicting the forms of oxen, horses, immortals, jade rings, and jade *jue*—along with inscriptions. This truly foretold the rise of the Sima clan to the Jin, as a sign of the Metal Virtue.\n\nIn the time of Emperor Yao, when the celestial *qi* was exhausted in the Great Yang and the terrestrial *qi* reached its limit in the Great Yin, the cycle of ninety-six years of Yang had run its course, and the turning of the celestial mandate fell upon the year of *jiashen*. It was a convergence of great calamities, and thus the five planets offered their essence, while the sun and moon cast murky shadows—such were the omens.\n\nIn the summer of the tenth year of Tianfu (Gengwu), at Guanshi in Hongzhou, beneath Mount Yuewang, before the Zhaoxian Temple, a sound like thunder erupted, accompanied by a five-colored radiance spanning ten *zhang*. The boundaries of Yuan, Ji, Jiang, and Hongzhou all witnessed the light and heard the sound. Before the temple, five-colored mists lingered for a month before dispersing. A stone, seven or eight *chi* in length and over three *chi* in circumference, clear and jade-like in hue, fell to the ground. The military governor and Chancellor Liu Wei ordered it carried into the Zhaoxian Temple, where a vegetarian feast was held to offer prayers and thanks. Within seven days, the stone shrank to three *chi* in length. After several more days of feasting, it diminished further to just over a *chi*, and now remains at seven or eight *cun*, preserved within the temple.\n\nFifty *li* south of Jiangzhou lies a shop called Qilidian. South of Shejiang, atop a small hill, stands a stone of green hue, hard and smooth. Local lore claims that within the stone lies a pearl, and every Mid-Autumn Festival, over a dozen of them take flight like shooting stars, gathering and scattering. At times, light shimmers upon the stone, and it is said that the pearls are hidden there—priceless treasures. Some who have witnessed this have secretly marked the spot, only to find nothing upon returning.\n\nLi Tiao, a presented scholar from Kuaiji, once chanced upon a small stone, dark green and flat, warm and smooth to the touch, which he used as a paperweight. A fly alighted upon it and, when shooed away, was found to have turned to stone. Testing it with other insects, they too transformed, their shells hardening and growing heavy, indistinguishable from stone.\n\nIn the mountain pavilion of Yongkang County in Muzhou, a withered pine tree was felled and accidentally fell into water, where it turned to stone. Untransformed portions were tested in the water and likewise petrified. The transformed parts—branches, trunk, and bark—remained identical to pine, save for their hardness. Several untransformed segments were kept as curiosities.\n\nIn the mountains of Changming County in Sizhou, within an area of some twenty *li*, lay countless porcelain incense burners, each about two *cun* wide, some intact, others broken, piled amidst the forest in untold numbers.\n\nIn the wild fields of Jianchang County in Hongzhou, natural stone steles, stone figures, and stone tortoises lay scattered across the earth in great numbers. All bore the appearance of having been carved, yet bore no inscriptions. Most of the stone figures lay face-down, though some stood upright. It was also said that nearby stood a stone well, deep but dry. The curious who entered it with torches found a side passage of unknown length, its walls lined with stone figures.\n\nThe Auspicious Stone Inscriptions of Changsong:\nWhen Li Xiyu served as Governor of Liangzhou, Qin Changsong produced an auspicious stone upon which characters had formed naturally—one hundred and ten in total. The gist read: *\"The High Emperor’s sea bears two characters; Li Nine, King Eight Thousand. The Great Peaceful Son of Heaven, Li Shimin, shall reign a thousand years. The Crown Prince? Governs Yanshan. Every man enters the kingdom. The Lord exalts Wang Kua, rewarding Wen Tong for a thousand generations of greatness. King Five, King Seven, King Ten. Phoenix-plumed talent, Wu Wenzheng of the Zhenguan era. Flourishing the sagely in all directions, governing ten thousand below. Loyalty and filial piety bring goodness.\"* The Court dispatched the Gentleman of the Ministry of Rites, Liu Cheng, to verify the report by post-horse.

When struck, it rang like a bell. Military commissioner Liu Shijian presented another stone, about four *chi* in length, round in shape and blue in color, which, when struck, resounded like a chime. Along the half-cliff of Linjiang in Wu Commandery, a stone emerged from a landslide. When drummed with a mallet, it produced no sound. Emperor Wu inquired of Zhang Hua, who replied: *\"Carve a fish from paulownia wood from Shu, and strike it—then it shall sing.\"* Following his advice, the sound carried for *li*.\n\nShi Jilong constructed a river bridge at Lingchang Ford, quarrying stones for its central pier. Yet no stone, great or small, remained in place, swept away by the current. Over five million laborers toiled in vain. Jilong dispatched envoys to make offerings, sinking jade disks into the river. Soon after, the submerged jade washed ashore, the earth quaked, and waves surged onto the ford, toppling towers and halls, crushing over a hundred to death.\n\nIn the *Qianfu* era, a monk from Tiantai, journeying east from Mount Tiantai into Linhai County, discovered a cave. With fellow monks of like mind, he ventured inside. For the first ten or twenty *li*, the path was low and narrow, often muddy.

      "translated_text": "That year, the Huai and Xi regions suffered agricultural devastation, leading to a great famine.\n\nThe tomb of Emperor Wu of Changsha of the Han lies two *li* east of Changsha County, standing twenty-seven *zhang* high with a circumference of six hundred *zhang*. Long ago, Wu Gang, the chief clerk to Zhuge Dan, was visited by a man who remarked, \"You bear a striking resemblance to Wu Yin.\" Startled, Gang asked, \"How do you know this?\" The visitor replied, \"In the third year of Huangchu, I once traveled to Changsha and saw men excavating Wu Yin’s tomb, where many jade artifacts were found. Yin’s corpse lay stiff, yet his appearance remained unchanged from life—you resemble him closely.\" Gang said, \"He was my seventh-generation ancestor. Since you saw him then, where is the jade now?\" The man answered, \"It was all placed in Sun Jian’s temple.\"\n\nThe tomb of Emperor Ding of Changsha of the Han, along with that of his mother, Lady Tang, each stands thirteen *zhang* high with a circumference of three *li*. The larger tomb rises eighteen *zhang*, and the two are separated by three *zhang*.\n\nSoutheast of Dangtu County in Xuanzhou stands Mount Heng, at whose base lie eight grand tombs. During the Qianfu era, thieves excavated one, uncovering a pit with a rope woven from seventy bolts of silk. A man was lowered to inspect it, but swarms of black bees assailed him. Overwhelmed, he fled in terror, and nothing was retrieved. Local tradition holds this to be the tomb of Governor Tao of Guangzhou, though its occupant’s name and era remain unknown.\n\nBefore the main hall of Hongzhou stood a Chinese honey locust tree, so vast that several men could barely encircle it. Birds dared not perch upon it, and those who trespassed against it met with immediate divine retribution—a phenomenon attested for centuries. In the main hall, official business was never conducted at inauspicious times, a long-standing custom. When Li Xian assumed the governorship, he ordered the tree felled, despite protests from officials and commoners alike. After its removal, thousands of crows gathered, cawing incessantly. Suspecting something beneath, Xian ordered the ground excavated. Several feet down, they uncovered a massive tomb. Inside lay a stone inscription bearing hundreds of cryptic characters, concluding: *\"This is the tomb of Guo Pu. Five hundred years hence, the tomb-raider Li Xian shall appear.\"* The prophecy foretold events yet to come, some of which are still recalled today. Xian then ordered the tomb restored and relocated the hall to avoid its site.\n\nAccording to records, in the first year of Emperor Yuan of the Eastern Jin, Guo Pu was executed by Wang Dun in Jiankang. It remains unclear why his tomb lies in Yuzhang. From the first year of the Eastern Jin (a *dingchou* year) to the reigns of Emperor Wenzong and Emperor Jingzong of the Tang, precisely five hundred years had passed.\n\nWhen Zhong Chuan first entered Hongzhou, he ordered the city walls repaired. Soldiers and officials scattered to gather bricks from old tombs for the construction. Upon completion, Chuan dreamed of a man in archaic robes, his neck elongated and his bearing like that of Zilu, who approached and said, \"General, why have you desecrated my resting place and left me unsettled? Restore it at once.\" Upon waking, Chuan questioned his officers and retainers, but none recognized the figure. Then, an elder named Luo Tong sought an audience and said, \"Old maps record that thirty-one *bu* southeast of the city’s corner lies the tomb of Master Ziyu—a site long said to be spiritually potent. I fear the soldiers may have taken bricks from it, offending its occupant.\" Chuan sent men to investigate, and the account proved true.",

Upon completion, the figure appeared in his dreams again to express gratitude. Chuan rewarded Luo Tong with bolts of silk.\n\n**Note:** Zhaitai Mieming, a disciple of Confucius, styled Ziyu, resided in Wucheng. Though his appearance was unremarkable, he was upright and prudent. Wucheng was not part of Yuzhang Commandery—why his tomb should lie here remains unknown.\n\nThe tomb of General Xu Jing stands outside Chengdu’s Yanqiu Gate, seven or eight *li* due west. In the fields rises a great barrow, said to be the general’s resting place. Those who till the land or tend livestock—be it oxen or swine—who trespass upon it invariably meet with misfortune. Though most wild tombs outside the city have been lost, this one alone remains untouched, and none dare violate it. Jing, in the service of Former Shu, rose to the rank of Grand Minister of Works.\n\nIn Shangyu County of Yuezhou, over twenty *li* south of the river, stands Nanbao Temple in Nanbao Village. To reach it, one crosses Heng Ridge. A man fond of exploring landscapes, weary from climbing the ridge, rested beneath a tree where an old villager had also paused. As they spoke of the mountains and rivers, the villager pointed to a tomb by the path and said, “If this tomb belongs to a man, there is nothing to say. But if it is a woman’s, her son shall rise to the rank of the Three Dukes.” The traveler found his words strange and inquired among the temple monks and villagers. One who knew the tale said, “This is the tomb of Zheng Zhu’s mother.”\n\nIn the early Yuanhe era, the temple had a female servant who became involved with a villager named Shi. She bore a son, who by the age of ten was put to work by the monks, fetching water and porridge for a traveling monk surnamed Zheng, who had suffered from dysentery for over a month. The boy’s diligence impressed the monk, who wished to take him as an attendant. The monks said, “His father, Shi, is still alive. We must ask him first.” Shi consented without hesitation. When the abbot questioned him, he agreed again. The monk took the boy away, naming him Zheng after his own surname. He taught the boy medical texts and arts, and the boy later encountered a wandering scholar, mastering various skills. Through connections with nobles and officials, he rose to prominence. In the Dahe era, he received extraordinary favor and was appointed Military Commissioner of Feng Prefecture. Later, he was executed for his crimes—this was Zheng Zhu. After his mother’s death, the temple monks buried her on the ridge, the very tomb the old villager had pointed out.\n\nLi Dao, in the late Xiantong era, served as a judicial officer in Fengxiang Prefecture. While investigating a case of tomb robbery, he questioned the culprits about their exploits. They confessed, “We have been thieves for thirty years. North of Xianyang, east of Mount Qi, and beyond the imperial mausolea, we have opened nearly every ancient tomb.” When asked what they had found, they recounted, “Once, we entered a tomb and descended a sloping passage over thirty *chi* deep to a stone door. When we pried it open, arrows shot out endlessly—over a hundred in all—until they ceased. We then forced the door open. The first thief to enter was struck by a spinning blade and fell dead. Inside, over ten wooden figures whirled swords with the speed of wind, making it impossible to approach. We used a wooden beam to block them, and the mechanism stopped. We removed all the blades, and the figures could no longer move. Inside, we found a chamber with curtains and bedding neatly arranged. A lacquer lamp burned brightly, and wooden mannequins stood in for concubines. Over a *zhang* above the ground hung an iron-bound coffin suspended by chains. When we struck it with a beam, the coffin shifted, and sand poured down like water, impossible to halt. It flooded the chamber and rushed out the door, rising over two *chi* deep. After a long while, the tomb filled with sand, and we could not re-enter. We never learned whose tomb it was.”\n\nAnother tomb stood on the plains of Xianyang. Upon entering, the thieves found two mirrors that could reflect a person’s nose. The reverse sides were polished and gleaming, as if new. When they rubbed the mirrors and looked into the front, their reflections appeared normal. But when they looked into the reverse, their forms were fully visible—clothing and hats in perfect order—yet inverted. Seven *li* northeast of Anzhou lay an ancient tomb, seven or eight *chi* high and several hundred *bu* in circumference. No one knew whose it was. When bandits dug into it, they found it sealed with cast iron, extending over a *zhang* deep with no end in sight.\n\nTwenty *li* east of the city stood a great tomb. Bandits spent days opening it and found over a hundred gold hairpins, each weighing a hundred *jin*, along with stone seats, miscellaneous treasures, and ancient-style belts arranged in abundance. When they took one of the belts, water surged forth, quickly filling the tomb. The opening they had made soon sealed itself. The thieves presented two stone lions to the prefect, Military Commissioner Wu. That night, the prefect dreamed of a man in archaic robes, accompanied by a large retinue, who came to pay his respects, saying, “I am Wu, the Southern Barbarian Minister. Bandits have desecrated my resting place. As you share my surname, I ask that you restore it. Let the thieves go mad, and do not arrest them.” The prefect ordered the tomb repaired. Soon after, over thirty bandits went mad and died one after another.\n\nIn the third year of the Qianning era (896 CE), Li Shitai, Prefect of Shuzhou, Military Advisor to the Commissioner, and Minister of Works, built his residence in Chengdu’s Jinpu Ward, within the North Gate’s western circuit, the first estate on the western side. To its west stood the shrine of Li Bing. North of the estate, the terrain rose gradually, with a ridge extending southwest to meet the shrine.

      "translated_text": "In the *yihai* year of the Yongping era, it was said that men of Kaifeng opened the tomb of Prince Cao Gao. They took the stone figures, sheep-and-horse bricks, and other such relics. The coffin remained intact, yet as soon as it was touched, it crumbled to ashes, leaving no trace of bone. Only a few gold vessels remained. Before the coffin stood a cast-silver basin, three *chi* wide, filled to the brim with water. At its center sat a jade child, three *chi* tall, and the water neither increased nor diminished. Thus was fulfilled the saying of Master Hong: \"Where jade is buried in a tomb, grasses and trees grow lush and moist; where gold abounds, they wither and parch.\" Since the reign of Zhenyuan, two hundred years had passed, yet the water in the basin never waned—such was the moisture of the jade.\n\nHongzhou’s Fengcheng County once lay south of the Po River, the very place where Lei Huan unearthed his swords. After the Yellow Scarves’ uprising, warfare raged everywhere, and the county’s lands were largely encroached upon by Fuzhou. Commissioner Tang Bao relocated the townsfolk north of the river, building a city atop Red Ridge. Its front faced sheer cliffs, deemed a natural stronghold. Graves were dug up to construct houses for the people, and markets of several thousand households arose upon the site. Many malevolent spirits appeared—tall and monstrous in form—injuring all who saw them. When Magistrate Tang was in the county, the people lived in peace. But whenever he left on official business, the spirits ran rampant, beyond restraint. Upon his return, all was calm again.\n\nLater, Tang was promoted to regional commissioner, and Magistrate Guo succeeded him in governing the county. The spirits submitted to Guo as they had to Tang. Yet if Guo briefly departed, the ghosts would wreak havoc. After several years, the county was abandoned and later restored to its original location. Within the yamen, the main hall proved especially uninhabitable. Recently, hundreds of refugee households from neighboring prefectures sought shelter there, but nearly all perished. At dusk and night, the ghosts often manifested, committing violence. It is suspected these were the vengeful spirits of ancient corpses buried in the old graves, though none know their age.\n\n*Record of Marvels*, Scroll Eight—end.",
      "overlap_context": "uth of Stone Bamboo Shoot. The so-called \"Stone Laugh\" is surely the tomb’s spirit tablet. Since then, the site has been imbued with numinous power, and none dare violate it.\n\nLater, the Lord of Shu repurposed the shrine, offering sacrifices to the Dragon Spirit. A small chamber, the Dragon Hall, was erected to the east of the tomb. Minister Li neither disturbed the ancient grave nor coveted the gold coins—his conduct reflects the lofty discernment of the ancients.\n\nHow admirable! How admirable!",
