Author unknown. One juan.

The ears should not be strained to hear, the eyes should not be fixed in prolonged gaze. Sitting should not reach exhaustion, lying down should not extend to excess. Clothe yourself before the cold arrives, disrobe after the heat has come. Avoid extreme hunger, for hunger harms the qi. Do not overeat, nor drink to excess when parched, for overindulgence in drink runs deep. Overeating gives rise to masses and accumulations, overdrinking leads to phlegm stagnation and wind-qi congealment. Avoid extreme exertion, avoid extreme idleness. Do not sweat profusely, do not run while drunk, do not ride a horse after a full meal, do not speak excessively, do not feign anger, do not force yourself to eat rich or fresh foods, do not expose your head after washing your hair. In winter, avoid extreme warmth; in summer, avoid extreme cold. Extreme warmth in winter brings spring epidemics, extreme cold in summer brings autumn malaria and dysentery. Do not expose yourself beneath the stars and moon, do not approach corpses while hungry, do not fan yourself while asleep, do not eat with your head uncovered, do not drink cold water while overheated, do not rush from intense cold to a blazing stove, do not face fierce winds after bathing, do not remove clothes while drenched in sweat, do not plunge into cold water while overheated, do not urinate or defecate facing the sun, moon, or the Northern Dipper, do not expose your body beneath the stars, do not charge through frost, mist, or mountain vapors. All these harm the viscera and dissipate the spirit and soul.\n\nThe five flavors must not be indulged to excess: too much sourness harms the spleen, too much bitterness harms the lungs, too much acridity harms the liver, too much sweetness harms the kidneys, too much saltiness harms the heart. These correspond to the five phases, subtly governing the four limbs—this can be reasoned and investigated. Scholars and gentlemen ought to take heed. Violating these principles will not immediately cause harm, but over time, they accumulate into decline and decay.\n\nTherefore, the heart is the master of the five viscera, qi the messenger of the hundred limbs. In action, harmony is the steed; in circulation, serenity is the chariot. When joints and labor grow weary, lie down and practice *daoyin*. If one does not cultivate the arts of nurturing and care, does not follow the Dao of peace and harmony, qi will falter in an instant, the body wither amid sensual pleasures. The fleeting self is wearied, melancholy thoughts consume the heart. Upon hearing this Dao, one should deeply cultivate and guard it.\n\nThus, the perfected person always remains tranquil, never indulging in reckless abandon. Yet fools, before their desires are even fulfilled, have already harmed their bodies, dissipated their spirit and soul, and injured their *po*. How lamentable!\n\n*The Discourse on Nurturing Life and Cultivating Nature by Peng Zu* concludes.",
