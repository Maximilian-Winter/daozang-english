  "full_translation": "**The Scripture of Orthodox Unity’s Ritual Texts: The Rite of the Grand Offering for Protecting the State and Appeasing the Seas**\n\nThe *Scripture of Orthodox Unity’s Ritual Texts: The Rite of the Grand Offering for Protecting the State and Appeasing the Seas* is of uncertain authorship, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. It is one of the surviving fragments of the early Celestial Masters’ scripture *The Ritual Texts of Orthodox Unity*. One scroll. Based on the text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Proper Section I.\n\nThe Most High addressed the Immortal Dou Ziming, saying: \"When future rulers and emperors encounter instability in their lands—when the celestial bodies fall into disorder, the sun and moon lose their proper course, yin and yang fall out of harmony, warfare arises on all sides, pestilence spreads, and the multitudes suffer death and injury—you and your disciples should hasten to perform rites of salvation and disaster-aversion, invoking blessings and dispelling obstacles to eliminate calamities. You ought to establish a grand offering based on the *River Chart*, making universal supplications to the Thirty-Two Heavens, the Thirty-Two Emperors, the sun, moon, and constellations, the Jade Armillary and Jade Balance, the Thirty-Six Earths, the sacred mountains and great rivers, the grotto-palaces of the immortals, and the local earth deities.\n\nPrepare one thousand two hundred trays of food, cakes, and fruits, along with golden dragons, jade rings, silk inscribed with the adept’s life-destiny, five-colored ritual banners for the five directions, golden coins, silk for offerings, banners, incense, lamps, candles, seats for the divine officials, memorial documents, paper, brushes, and ritual knives—all arranged with utmost purity and order. Exhaust your sincerity in presenting memorials, repenting transgressions, and beseeching blessings and grace with offerings of faith.\n\nThe Son of Heaven shall use a bolt of silk; feudal lords, a *zhang*; and commoners, a *chi*. Alternatively, three hundred sixty trays or two hundred forty trays may be used. Appoint diligent Daoists—twelve, nine, or three in number—who, after bathing, purifying themselves, burning incense, donning clean robes, and observing abstinence, shall ascend the altar on an auspicious day to perform the rites and make universal supplications. Upon completion, distribute the golden dragons, jade rings, blue paper, blue silk, silver tablets, counting rods, and ritual tallies to the sacred mountains and great rivers. Present memorials and offerings, using thirty-six trays of food, cakes, and fruits—or twenty-four trays. Arrange the silk inscribed with the adept’s life-destiny, the five-colored ritual banners, golden coins, silk for offerings, incense, oil lamps, candles, paper, brushes, and seats for the divine officials in descending order of their original quantities. Display them in full array to address the immortals of the grotto-palaces, presenting your sincerity to invoke blessings and avert disasters. Cast the offerings into limpid pools or mountain caverns to safeguard the state’s destiny, recording the names of the immortals. The inscriptions on the silver tablets shall follow the *Lingbao* talisman format, concealed in the depths of mountains or waters. If kept secret, blessings shall descend; if revealed, misfortune shall arrive, plunging one into eternal darkness without divine protection.\"\n\nThe Most High further instructed Ziming: \"Those who study the Dao and seek immortality must devote themselves earnestly, laboring for the state and aiding the people, placing others before themselves. Through memorials, offerings, coins, and dispersed acts of merit—such as almsgiving to the poor, constructing quiet abodes, burning incense, lighting lamps, aiding all beings, releasing life, and delivering the dead—when their merits reach three thousand, they shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\"\n\nThereupon, Dou Ziming and his assembly prostrated themselves, unanimously praising the teaching, and withdrew after paying their respects.\n\nThe Heavenly Master declared: \"As pure virtue wanes and deceit proliferates, the Dao and virtue decline, and a hundred disasters arise, causing the land to become unstable, households to wither, omens and monstrosities to emerge, pestilence to spread, livelihoods to falter, and misfortune to strike with every move. Some may suffer demotion, loss of office, or stagnation in rank; others may face resentment, slander, or humiliation. There may be theft, banditry, or disturbances within and without, leading to the loss of territory and the people’s wealth. Fear and chaos may drive the populace to rebellion, or descendants may turn against their kin, causing households to decline. All undertakings may go awry, and every action may bring misfortune. In such times, one should perform offerings to the dragon deities—whether the dragons of the sea, rivers, or household waters—and worship them as one sees fit.\n\nThe offering rites must be pure and solemn. Use the finest seasonal fruits, ensuring they are fragrant. Perform the rites on an auspicious day, continuing for three years to bring peace to the state and prosperity to the people, filling granaries with grain. After nine years, gold and silk shall accumulate, and all endeavors shall succeed. This method is divinely efficacious; the Dao does not deceive.\n\nFor the ritual seats, use gold, silver, and precious treasures, along with silk banners and brocade robes, to clothe the dragon deities.\"\n\nFive golden dragons, each weighing one tael; *benming* patterned silk, with the Son of Heaven using one bolt of purple-patterned silk and feudal lords using *benming* silk. Five-directional ritual silks follow the colors of their respective directions: nine bolts for the East, three for the South, seven for the West, five for the North, and twelve for the Center. Crimson-patterned silk of three zhang and five chi, and for the Son of Heaven, three hundred fifty chi—these serve as ritual tokens of sincerity.\n\nThe Divine King of the Eastern Sea, Sovereign of Waters, wears upon his head the Great Dawn Treasure Radiance Crown. His robe is of azure brocade adorned with kingfisher-feather patterns, and his sash bears the Azure Numinous Nine-Colored Lion-and-Tiger Initiation Satchel. On the days of *Lichun* and the Spring Equinox, he mounts a jade-green chariot drawn by flying dragons and ascends to the High August Jade Emperor to inscribe the records of sins expunged and immortals registered, presenting his memorial before the Jade Emperor of Supreme Purity.\n\nThe Divine King of the Southern Sea, Sovereign of Waters, wears upon his head the Great Dawn Treasure Radiance Crown. His robe is of crimson brocade, and his sash bears the Cinnabar Numinous Three-Colored Striking Satchel. On the days of *Lixia* and the Summer Solstice, he rides a dragon-drawn flying cloud chariot and ascends to the High August Jade Emperor to inscribe the records of sins expunged and immortals registered, presenting his memorial before the Jade Emperor of Supreme Purity.\n\nThe Divine King of the Western Sea, Sovereign of Waters, wears upon his head the Great Dawn Treasure Radiance Crown. His robe is of white brocade with flying patterns, and his sash bears the White Numinous Life-Spirit Seal and the Nine-Colored Lion-and-Tiger Initiation Satchel. On the days of *Liqiu* and the Autumn Equinox, he mounts a white mist flying chariot and ascends to the High August Jade Emperor to inscribe the records of sins expunged and immortals registered, presenting his memorial before the Jade Emperor of Supreme Purity.\n\nThe Divine King of the Northern Sea, Sovereign of Waters, wears upon his head the Great Dawn Treasure Radiance Crown. His robe is of *qi*-brocade with flying patterns, and his sash bears the Vast Release Seven Primes Five-Colored Lion-and-Tiger Initiation Satchel. On the days of *Lidong* and the Winter Solstice, he mounts a *qi*-mist flying chariot and ascends to the High August Jade Emperor to inscribe the records of sins expunged and immortals registered, presenting his memorial before the Jade Emperor of Supreme Purity.\n\nFor the rites of offering to the sea deities, one must perform the offerings on the celestial days corresponding to the four seasons. Additionally, on the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months, present the ledgers of merits, transgressions, blessings, and retributions—life and death records—before the Three Palaces of Heaven. Those destined for rebirth are recorded in the Left Palace; those destined for immortality, in the Central Palace; and those destined for death, in the Right Palace. Matters concerning demotions, long-term servitude, great and small kalpas, and the myriad spirits of the waters are all reported in accordance with their causes, ensuring correspondence between the celestial and terrestrial realms. If there are those whose *qi* remains unrectified, they are to be examined and corrected during the three assemblies. The Three Officials—of Heaven, Earth, and Water—are also invoked.\n\nNext, visualize the deities.\nNext, strike the celestial drum.\n\nNext, kindle the incense burner.\nThe Most High Mysterious Origin, Five Numinous Venerable Lord, now summons the Merit Recorders and Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Incense-Bearing Envoys, and the Three *Qi* Rectifying Deities. Urgently report and present this to the Three Heavens’ Most High Mysterious Origin Dao Lord: we now burn incense and perform this offering rite, swiftly delivering it before the Imperial Presence.\nBow twice.\n\nNext, declare the ritual rank:\nGreat Immortal Capital, Orthodox Unity, Balanced *Qi*—this Daoist of the Celestial Master’s lineage, the minor male official, your servant [Name], bows twice with reverence.\n\nRespectfully invoke:\nThe Eastern Supreme Ninefold Mystery Jade Void Imperial Sovereign, Great Clarity Mysterious Origin;\nThe Most High Lord of the Great Dao of the Primordial Ultimate of the Three Heavens, the Venerable Lord of the Many Masters, the Jade Maidens of Tang Valley, the Great Imperial Lord of Fusang, the Heavenly Imperial Lord;\nThe Central Yellow Venerable Lord, the Nine Elder Immortal Capital Lords, the Nine *Qi* Masters, the Jade Throne of Great Clarity, the Jade Treasure King of Supreme Clarity and Great Perfection, the Prime Minister and Eastern Sea Jade Gate’s Eastern Florescence Youth Lord, the High Immortals and Myriad Sages of the Mysterious Ultimate Heavenly Worthies.\nBow twice.\n\nRespectfully invoke the Eastern Sea Spirit, Lord Aming Hegui.\nBow twice.\nRespectfully invoke the Southern Sea Spirit, Lord Zhushi Liuxiao.\nBow twice.\nRespectfully invoke the Western Sea Spirit, Lord Chengli Koulai.\nBow twice.\nRespectfully invoke the Northern Sea Spirit, Lord Yuqiang Haocinqiang.\nBow twice.\nRespectfully invoke the Water Emperor Spirits, Divine Officials, and Dragon Kings of Tang Valley’s Azure Florescence and Fangzhu Palace;\nRespectfully invoke the Water Emperor Spirits, Divine Officials, and Dragon Kings of the Azure Numinous Southern Water Assembly Palace;\nRespectfully invoke the Spirits, Divine Officials, and Dragon Kings of the Northern Capital’s Luodeng Palace;\nRespectfully invoke the Three Spirit Immortals of the Azure Sea, the Water Emperors of Penglai, Fangzhang, and Yingzhou, and the Divine Officials and Dragon Kings of all their palaces;\nRespectfully invoke the Five Directions’ Dragon Spirit Lords;\nRespectfully invoke the Five Directions’ Dragon Kings;\nRespectfully invoke the Five Directions’ Dragon King Elders;\nRespectfully invoke the Eastern Azure Emperor and Azure Dragon Spirit King;\nRespectfully invoke the Southern Vermilion Emperor and Vermilion Dragon Spirit King;\nRespectfully invoke the Western White Emperor and White Dragon Spirit King;\nRespectfully invoke the Northern *Qi* Emperor and *Qi* Dragon Spirit King;\nRespectfully invoke the Central Yellow Emperor and Yellow Dragon Spirit King;\nRespectfully invoke the Heavenly Flying Dragon Spirit Lords;\nRespectfully invoke the Earthly Reclining Dragon Spirit Lords;\nRespectfully invoke the Sun and Moon Dragon Spirit Lords;\nRespectfully invoke the Constellation Dragon Spirit Lords;\nRespectfully invoke the Cloud Dragon and Rain Dragon Spirit Lords;\nRespectfully invoke all the Dragon Spirit Lords of the Five Marchmounts, sacred mountains, hills, and mounds;\nRespectfully invoke the Dragon Spirit Lords guarding the nation’s lands, palaces, and treasuries;\nRespectfully invoke the River Earls and River Lords of the Three Rivers, Nine Jiang, Four Seas, Four Marshes, grotto sources, limpid pools, thousand streams, ten thousand valleys, and Twelve Huai waterways, as well as the Water Emperors, Water Palaces, and all Dragon Spirit Lords of the Four Directions and Eight Extremities.\nMay all don their solemn attire, crowns, and descend to the ritual space to partake in the offerings.\nBow twice.\n\nYour servant [Name] respectfully petitions the Eastern Sea Youth Lord, the Divine Officials, Water Emperors, and all Dragon Kings and Spirit Lords of the sea’s palaces and water palaces:\nBy fortunate karmic destiny, I was born into this world and humbly entered the Daoist lineage. My heart yearns to aid and deliver, to assist the nation and sustain life, to save and ferry the multitudes. Trembling with awe, I now present my sincere words.\nNext, recite the petition.\n\nAccording to the petition’s profound sincerity and earnest prayers, having received this trust and reverence, I dare not remain silent. I humbly submit that His Imperial Majesty’s heart is set upon humble palaces and frugal meals, nurturing the common people while bearing heaven’s heavy charge. He wishes to practice virtue and the Dao, desiring to widely bestow imperial transformation, govern through non-action, reflect thrice and ponder ninefold, secure the ancestral altars, and harmonize all under heaven to fulfill his aspirations. Relying upon the sea spirits and dragon kings, may they graciously condescend to this offering rite, descend in mercy to partake, and gather blessings for the nation.\nRespectfully presented for your awareness.\nYour servant [Name] bows twice.\n\nNext, offer incense.\nYour servant [Name] respectfully petitions the Sea Spirits, Dragon Kings, Water Emperors, Water Palaces, and all their divine officials:\nMay the great compassion of the numinous spirits descend, responding to the pleas of the living. May grace flow to the sentient and blessings extend to the insentient. May a single return of divine aid amplify our sincerity, and unseen blessings be added in support. May the Emperor’s divine majesty reach afar, his plans and strategies grow ever clearer, his insight penetrate the obscure, and his foreknowledge discern all matters. May every prayer and wish be fulfilled, the realm know peace, and the multitudes enjoy prosperity. May the Six Directions return to harmony, like stars revolving around the celestial pole; may all nations come to pay homage, like rivers flowing to the sea. May weapons be laid down, armor stilled, horses released, and oxen rested. May the people be nurtured without severity, governed without coercion. May virtue and the Dao be cultivated to repay great kindness. May heavenly disasters dissolve like clouds, and earthly calamities scatter like mist. May ministers be loyal and children filial, rulers benevolent and fathers kind.\n\nMay the Emperor eternally uphold the celestial honor, unchanging as heaven; may the Empress long occupy the earthly dignity, immovable as earth. May the Crown Prince, imperial princes, and brothers all take deep root, the imperial lineage flourishing abundantly, its branches enduring for ten thousand years and a thousand autumns, their glory unceasing. May all under heaven know no disasters, hells cease their suffering, prisons end their litigations, and all beings receive blessings. By the divine power of the spirits, may every wish be fulfilled, all virtues gather, and boundless grace be received.\nYour servant [Name] bows twice.\n\nNext, offer incense.\nYour servants [Names] respectfully petition the Eastern Sea Youth Lord, the Divine Officials, Water Emperors, and all Dragon Kings and Spirit Lords of the sea’s palaces and water palaces:\nThe Emperor now seeks blessings and averts calamities, invoking all these divine officials to present this modest offering. May the Great Sages and Mysterious Ones deign to witness it, responding as swiftly as echo follows sound. No further words are needed, nor repetition required. The rites of gratitude are complete, the incense offering concluded. May your cloud chariots and jade carriages, feathered canopies ascending, not tarry as the shadows shift and time passes. The lower realm is desolate and impure, unfit for prolonged stay. May you bestow compassion, extending vast grace.\nYour servant [Name] bows twice and respectfully escorts the deities’ departure.\n\nNext, chant the hymn of farewell.\nNext, offer incense.\n\nNext, replenish the incense burner. To the Incense Official Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all Attending Spirit Officials of the incense:\nMay the naturally arising golden liquid, cinnabar essence, and mushroom spirits of this offering site gather here before this incense altar. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected beings converge in this place. May we who study the Dao attain transcendence and ascend as immortals. May the Emperor receive blessings, and the realm be graced in all ten directions. May jade maidens and immortal youths attend the incense smoke, conveying our words directly before the divine.\n\n**The Primordial Numinous Treasure’s Decree to the Water Emperors for the Erasure of Sins from the Tablet**\n\nThe Numinous Treasure [addresses] the Water Emperors:\n[Name], styled [Courtesy Name], aged [X] years, born in the [X] month, prays for divine favor and immortal longevity, that the Three Origins may endure and the Nine Palaces’ Water Emperors and the twelve river sources’ great spirits of the Jiang, Hai, Huai, and Ji—along with the numinous deities of the underworld—erase his sinful name and report it to the Nine Heavens. He petitions to proceed to the Water Palace’s Golden Dragon Post for transmission.\n\nIn the [X] year of the Great Year, the [X] month, the [X] day of the new moon, this decree is proclaimed in [X]
