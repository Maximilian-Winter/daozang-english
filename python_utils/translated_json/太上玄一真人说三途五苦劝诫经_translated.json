  "full_translation": "The Supreme Perfected of the Mysterious Unity Speaks the Sutra of Admonitions on the Three Paths and Five Sufferings\n\n#1 The Dao spoke: Within the formless chaos, I surveyed the boundless qi of the heavens, countless in number. The rise and fall of heaven and earth, the retributions of life and death—none lack their counterparts, none lack their return. As heaven and earth revolve, the four seasons alternate in decline and renewal. The radiance of the sun and moon waxes and wanes, extinguishing and rebirthing in cycles. Humans, born of qi, possess intentions refined or coarse, conduct right or wrong. Their aspirations shape their form, while their deluded traces persist. Merit and transgression are recorded without the slightest omission, all made manifest before heaven and earth, their principles distinctly apportioned.\n\nThus, the dead are numberless, yet rebirth does not cease. All revolve through the turning of souls and spirits, endlessly returning, none but their former selves, cycling without end. Therefore, within the formless void, I opened the Eight Gates for all future lives, establishing the Dharma Wheel to instruct the ignorant, admonish through karmic conditions, and deliver the myriad beings.\n\nNow, as the Dao is cultivated and the practice of non-action attained, one knows their past lives and achieves utmost perfection. Yet I now behold beings from the boundless worlds beyond the Eight Gates—like grains of dust they come—common folk, men and women, learned and unlearned, heedless of their past lives, violating precepts and transgressing laws. They die in agony, dragged through the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, no longer retaining human form, all enduring the retribution for the evils of their former lives, receiving their due in this present existence.\n\nSeeing this, I grieve in silence, their suffering etched upon their forms, my compassion dwelling in my heart. Thus, I now turn the Dharma Wheel to deliver them. Let those who come heed this with clarity and caution, and attend to it with care.\n\n#2 The Dao spoke: I once surveyed the heavens and emerged through the Eastern Gate, where I beheld common folk, men and women, their mouths and faces festering with pus and blood, stinking and oozing. Their necks hung like threads, their bellies swelled like drums. Iron awls pierced their bodies, fire filled their mouths. Young and old dragged one another through burning coals, no longer human in form. Their feet trod upon blades, their bodies bore iron rods—pain unbearable, agony unendurable.\n\nGrieving for them, my compassion knew no bounds. The Dao asked: What crimes have these people committed? What karmic conditions from their past lives, what transgressions in their conduct, what sins have they accumulated to incur such retribution, such torment?\n\nA flying immortal of the Eastern Realm replied: These are sinners. In their former lives, they wielded malicious speech and venomous tongues, slandered the Dao and virtue, assailed their masters and teachers, and engaged in mutual defamation. Some wantonly killed and harmed, heedless of sentient beings, practicing cruelty and oppression. Their hearts harbored dark malice, slaughtering without restraint. Envious of those superior to them, they suppressed the worthy and wise. Thus, they have summoned this retribution, enduring every suffering. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn in the paths of non-human beings. Such are their karmic causes.\n\nThe Dao said: Let these beings reflect upon their past deeds, contemplate goodness, and enter the Dharma Wheel. Let them receive admonitions, be reborn among humans, and cultivate this Dao of mine to resolve their past retributions. Let them aspire to practice the Dao, widely open the Dharma gates, and establish fields of merit. When their merit is complete and their virtue perfected, they shall ascend into the Eastern Gate, behold the roots of their past lives, and receive deliverance, attaining the rank of flying immortals.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I once surveyed the heavens and emerged through the Western Gate, where I beheld common folk, men and women, with ox heads and beastly bodies, their tongues pulled out and pierced with iron awls. Mighty celestial enforcers beat them ceaselessly with iron rods, their bodies festering, no longer human in form. Their feet stood upon mountains of blades—pain unbearable, agony unendurable.\n\nSeeing this, I grieved without end. The Dao asked: What crimes have these people committed? What karmic conditions from their past lives, what fundamental transgressions have they committed to incur such retribution, such torment?\n\nA flying immortal of the Western Realm replied: These are sinners. In their former lives, they acted without the Dao, defied their masters’ commands, and slighted the Three Treasures. Their words belied their hearts; they undermined their roots and assailed their superiors. They cursed and swore, invoking gods and ghosts. They drank to excess, indulging in greed and desire without restraint. Some slandered the good and praised the wicked, defamed the worthy, flattered and harmed the loyal and virtuous, and took lives. The grievances of their victims cried out endlessly. Such grave sins have summoned this retribution, enduring every suffering. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn in the frontier lands of barbarians, possessing human form but lacking human sentiment. Such are their karmic causes.\n\nThe Dao said: Let these beings reflect upon their past deeds, contemplate their sufferings, and reform to do good. Let them enter the Dharma Wheel, receive admonitions, and be reborn in the Central Kingdom. Let them cultivate this Dao of mine to resolve their past retributions, aspire to do good, and widely establish fields of merit. Let them receive deliverance, enter my Western Gate, and behold the celestial beings enjoying the fruits of their meritorious deeds, eternally partaking of boundless retribution.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I once surveyed the heavens and emerged through the Southern Gate, where I beheld common folk, men and women, naked and unclothed, swallowing fire and eating coals, burned by flames. Their heads and faces were scorched, their entire bodies festering, no longer human in form. They wore iron cauldrons upon their heads, their feet resting upon mountains of fire—pain unbearable, torment unfit to behold.\n\nSeeing this, I grieved, my compassion dwelling in my heart. The Dao asked: From whence did these beings arise? What past lives gave them birth? What karmic conditions, what unlawful deeds have they committed to incur such retribution, such torment?\n\nA flying immortal of the Southern Realm replied: These sinners, in their former lives, wielded divisive speech and double tongues, slandered Daoists, and assailed the worthy. They were neither filial nor kind, neither benevolent nor loyal. They cursed and insulted their parents, and their six relations harmed one another. Some boiled and slaughtered livestock, cruelly taking animal lives, roasting and devouring them for momentary pleasure, heedless of their past lives. Others became butchers, slaughtering and dismembering countless beings. Such fundamental transgressions have summoned this retribution, enduring every suffering.\n\nAfter ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn among the six kinds of livestock to repay their former enmities—such are their karmic causes.\n\nThe Dao said: Might these beings be allowed to reform their past conduct, reflect upon goodness, and enter the Wheel of Dharma? Thus may they be reborn among men, receive admonitions, cultivate a heart of compassion, and widely establish merit. Then, having undergone deliverance, they may enter our Southern Gate, behold the hosts of heaven, and partake in the blessings of good deeds, forming karmic bonds with virtue.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I have often surveyed the heavens and, journeying through the Northern Gate, beheld common folk—men and women—naked and bare, young and old alike, dragging one another into cauldrons of boiling broth. Their bodies steep in scalding liquid, drenched in a hundred poisons, flesh rotting from their bones, suffering beyond endurance. Then they are cast into icy springs or thrust into the Northern Hell, where their necks and feet are shackled in cangues, their bodies subjected to torture. Confined in dark, heavy cages, they see not the three lights.\n\nThe Dao asked: From whence do these beings come? Through which gate were they born? With what have they formed karmic bonds? What deities have they offended? Though men incur retribution, how can such cruelty be so extreme? It is most pitiable.\n\nA flying immortal of the Northern Realm replied: These sinners, in their former lives, slew their lords and fathers, plotted rebellion against their masters, and murdered men. Some, relying on strength, oppressed the weak, betrayed friends, and assailed the virtuous. They lodged false accusations with officials, ensnaring the innocent in unjust lawsuits. Their grievances filled the heavens. Some exposed themselves beneath the three lights, defiling and insulting the lords of the age. Others destroyed quiet abodes, temples, and halls of governance. Some stole scriptures, transmitting them without vows, or cast doubt upon orthodox texts, slandering sacred writings. Some burned heavenly scriptures, showing contempt for the numinous and true. Such grave transgressions have summoned this retribution, enduring every torment.\n\nAfter ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn among the six kinds of livestock, or as lowly men, deaf, blind, or afflicted with the six maladies, their forms no longer human—such are their karmic causes.\n\nThe Dao said: Might these beings reflect upon their past conduct, reform their hearts, and turn to goodness? Let them be instructed in the Wheel of Dharma, receive admonitions, and be reborn in the human realm. Let them submit to precepts, cultivate the Dao anew, undergo deliverance, and enter our Northern Gate. There, beholding their past lives, they may come to know the utmost truth.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I have often surveyed the heavens and, journeying through the Northeast Gate, beheld common folk—men and women—with shaven heads and iron collars, shackled and burdened with mountains and stones. They tread back and forth upon beds of iron needles, denied rest day or night. Young and old follow one another in uncountable numbers, their suffering as bitter as mud and ashes, unbearable to witness.\n\nThe Dao asked: By what karmic cause were these beings born? Through which gate did they enter life? What sins have they accumulated? What deities have they offended to incur such retribution, enduring such torment? When shall their bodies, wracked by torture, find release?\n\nA flying immortal of the Northeast Realm replied: These sinners, in their former lives, abused their wealth and power to oppress the poor and lowly, forcibly seizing property and taking lives. Some became bandits, attacking one another, or robbed men of their beloved, violated the wives and concubines of others, and separated mothers from their children. Some committed incest among the six relations, defiling their own kin. Such grave transgressions have summoned this retribution.\n\nAfter enduring three rounds of torture, they shall be reborn among cattle and horses—such are their karmic causes.\n\nThe Dao, beholding them with sorrow and pity, addressed the flying immortal: Let these beings reflect upon their past lives and the transgressions they committed. Let them reform now, form karmic bonds with virtue, and escape this calamity. Let them cultivate merit, widely establish fields of blessing to atone for past wrongs, and receive admonitions. Then, delivered through the Northeast Gate, they may behold the multitude of good deeds, know the roots of their fate, and, with the Wheel of Rebirth unceasing, enter the boundless realm.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I have often surveyed the heavens and, journeying through the Southwest Gate, beheld common folk—men and women—naked and bare, embracing copper pillars. The pillars bore fiery needles that pierced their backs and bellies. Beasts of Mount Tai devoured their flesh as they stood upon iron grates. Young and old were dragged along, their human forms lost, their suffering as bitter as mud and ashes, unbearable to witness.\n\nThe Dao asked: What transgressions have these beings committed? What karmic causes bind them? What fundamental crimes have they wrought to incur such punishment? How many years of torment must they endure before release?\n\nA flying immortal of the Southwest Realm replied: These sinners, in their former lives, forcibly seized the food of others, cut short lives for profit, borrowed without repayment, and deceived men of their possessions. Relying on strength, they bullied the weak, their greed insatiable. When they obtained what they desired, they rejoiced; when they failed, they grew resentful, seizing opportunities to strike others and vent their malice. Some showed contempt for their elders, mocked the poor and sick, or exposed themselves, offending the three lights. They disrespected heaven and earth, feared neither ghosts nor spirits. Such grave transgressions have summoned this retribution, repaying their past enmities.\n\nAfter ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn as lowly servants—such are their karmic causes.\n\nThe Dao, beholding them with sorrow and endless pity, addressed the flying immortal: Let these beings reflect upon their past lives, reform their hearts, and turn to goodness. Let them cultivate the Dao anew, widely establish merit to dispel past enmities, and receive admonitions. Then, delivered through the Southwest Gate, they may behold the multitude of good deeds, know the consequences of sin and blessing, and, with the Wheel of Rebirth unceasing, enter the Dao of Non-Action.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I have often surveyed the heavens and, journeying through the Southeast Gate, beheld common folk—men and women—with shaven heads and iron collars, confined in dark, heavy cages. They saw not the three lights, but dwelt within the Five Peaks, where they were tortured thrice daily with iron rods, their beatings uncountable. Once their sentences were fixed, their souls were condemned to death, their bodies lashed and cast into the mountains to fill rivers and seas with earth and stone. Young and old were dragged along, enduring the five sufferings, their torment as bitter as mud and ashes, unbearable to witness.\n\nThe Dao spoke: What karmic conditions bind these souls? What deeds in past lives have led them here? Which divine laws did they transgress? Who is born without sin, yet they alone suffer thus?\n\nA celestial being of the Southeast Realm replied: These sinners in former lives took life and made wanton sacrifices, feeding shamans and demons. They mocked Daoist masters, slandered Perfected Ones, abandoned the true Law for falsehood, betrayed their teachers and the Dao, and cursed the virtuous. With disheveled hair, they raised their faces to the heavens, crying out to gods in blasphemous rites, seeking to kill others through dark invocations. Some scorned the sun and moon, reviled the stars, or devised their own heretical teachings, refusing to believe in past lives. Others destroyed mountains and dammed springs, blocking the paths of spirits, or desecrated graves, stealing burial garments, exposing bones to the wilds. They ridiculed those who did good, claimed their own ways were right, envied their betters, and harbored secret malice. Their sins are grave, and thus they face this retribution. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn among the lowly, afflicted by the six extremes, bearing crippling diseases or lifelong infirmities, repaying their past transgressions. Such are their causes.\n\nThe Dao, seeing this, was filled with sorrow and pity. To the celestial being, the Dao said: Let these souls reform their past conduct, reflect on their past lives, and cultivate goodness in this life. Let them establish merit, broaden their fields of blessing, and through sincere and earnest effort, atone for their former faults. Let them form a bond with the Dao, pass through the Southeast Gate, receive admonitions, and renew their virtuous deeds. Thus may they be reborn among humankind, learn to deliver all beings, and forge a karmic link with the Dao.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I have often surveyed the heavens and, journeying through the Northwest Gate, beheld common folk—men and women—with shaven heads and severed locks, climbing sword trees where winds from all eight directions blow the branches up and down. Below, their feet tread upon blade mountains, back and forth without end. Their hands and feet are torn and mangled, pus and blood flowing forth, unbearable to witness, their pain beyond endurance.\n\nThe Dao asked: What crimes have these souls committed? What past deeds have brought them here? Which scriptures or precepts did they violate to suffer such cruelty?\n\nA celestial being of the Northwest Realm replied: These sinners in former lives were vain and covetous, chasing fame and profit. Outwardly, they feigned devotion to the teachings, but hoarded treasures and refused to receive the scriptures. Though they accepted the texts, their faith was half-hearted, their minds gripped by stinginess. Before mastering the scriptures, they presumptuously styled themselves as teachers, ignoring the required years of study. They transmitted the teachings to disciples without celestial or terrestrial sanction, lacking sacred vows, passing them on carelessly. Those who received the texts were irreverent; those who bestowed them were negligent. They revealed secret texts, spreading them among the vulgar, causing the foolish to blame and slander the true Dao and revile the sacred scriptures. Some received the scriptures with impurity and disdain, slighting the Three Treasures, disregarding their teachers’ instructions, and following their own whims. Others observed precepts carelessly, their thoughts wandering. Their sins are grave, and thus they face this retribution. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn among the most foolish, forever cut off from the Dao, or afflicted by the six illnesses—deafness, blindness, and dullness. Such are their causes.\n\nThe Dao, seeing this, was filled with sorrow and pity. To the celestial being, the Dao said: Though these souls violated the precepts, they once entered the gateway of the Law. Let them reflect on the evil of their past conduct and turn their thoughts to goodness. Let them establish merit, submit to their teachers’ guidance, and pass through the Northwest Gate to receive admonitions. Thus may they be reborn among humankind, receive the sacred scriptures anew, diligently practice the great work, and when their merit is complete and their virtue widespread, ascend to the realm of the Perfected.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I open the Eight Gates to observe all beings from afar. I see common folk—men and women, learned and unlearned—heedless of past lives, committing every manner of primordial evil, overturning heaven and earth, sparing nothing in their transgressions. When their sins are complete, their souls are condemned to the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties, where they are tortured and beaten, their pain and poison boundless. Young and old are dragged along, mired in suffering, bound for kalpas without release. My sorrow and pity cannot be stilled.\n\nThus do I open the way to deliverance, offering admonitions that they may reflect on goodness and recall the sins of their past lives. Let them reform their conduct, inwardly embrace the Wheel of the Law, and swiftly attain rebirth among humankind. There, let them perform great merit, bestow kindness and charity, broaden their fields of blessing, revere their teachers and the sacred texts, and cultivate filial devotion. When their merit is complete and their virtue perfected, let them atone for past transgressions, receive blessings, enter the Dao’s realm, and awaken to their past lives, thus attaining Perfection.\n\nThis Law is vast and universal; its merit extends to all. Those who see these words shall, by their innate roots, liberate themselves, escape the Five Sufferings, be freed from the Three Paths, and forever leave the Eight Difficulties. In this life, they shall know peace; in every life, wealth and nobility; their families shall prosper. Reflecting on past lives, they shall form bonds with goodness.\n\nIf one observes perpetual fasting, burns incense, and performs prostrations, widely saves all beings, aids the multitude, practices self-sacrificing generosity, does what others cannot do, bears what others cannot bear, and cultivates all deeds in accord with the Law, they shall ascend as immortals, riding clouds and dragons, soaring through the heavens.\n\n*Verse on the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and the Rootless Fate*\n\nI journey through the Eight Gates,\nSurveying the heavens without limit.\nIn boundless worlds, I intimately know all karmic threads.\nI see common folk—men and women—\nWretched souls wailing, dragged through the Eight Difficulties.\nThey swallow fire and eat coals, bear stones and climb mountains.\nThey tread upon sword trees, where wind and blades assail them.\nTheir bodies are torn and broken, no longer human in form.\nSeeing this, I grieve, overcome with sorrow.\nI ask: What crimes have they committed? What past deeds bind them?\nBound to this retribution, they know not their karmic roots.\nLost, they cannot reform, sinking into the causes of sin.\nI think of you through kalpas, enduring every suffering.\nThe Three Lights are forever veiled; their hidden pain is unspeakable.\n\nGazing upon my Eight Gates, they are utterly obscured.\n\n**Gāthā on the Wondrous Awakening and the Wheel of Past Lives**\n\nThe wondrous awakening comes and goes with grace,\nSoul and spirit never briefly perish.\nWithin each cycle of life and death,\nForm and soul do not falter.\nThe gates of heaven and earth for sin and blessing,\nEach karmic encounter returns to unity.\nOnce one fully awakens to past deeds,\nThe Three Paths remain forever inescapable.\nThe Flying Immortals preach admonitions,\nGuiding one out through the revolving Eight Gates.\nContemplate the root of past lives,\nAccumulate goodness to liberate oneself.\nLet transformations be reborn among humans,\nOnly then does one realize fate’s unbroken flow.\nEstablish and open fields of blessing,\nBroadly save and aid all beings.\nWhen merit is complete and virtue widespread,\nTranscendence has no equal.\nThe body enjoys boundless years,\nSpirit rejoices, form delights.\nRoaming freely with fate’s shifts,\nCarefree in the chamber of non-action.\nLooking back at the foul gates of sin,\nForever parting from them with you.\n\n**Gāthā on the Dharma Wheel Lifting the Root of Life to Ascend the Mysterious**\n\nThe Eight Gates of karmic conditions,\nWhere sin and blessing arise.\nAt times, those with intent are seen,\nReflecting and awakening to heavenly sentiment.\nFor your sake now, I open the gates to expound the wondrous scripture.\nAs spoken in this scripture,\nEons of kalpas shall all receive glory.\nSubmitting and accepting admonitions,\nUse the scripture to deliver my form.\nContemplate the root of past lives,\nPull free the bonds of former selves.\nSurpass and transcend the Three Nets,\nThe Eight Difficulties thus vanish.\nThe soul returns to its settled essence,\nThe spirit commands honor from this.\nExtinction is like shedding a womb,\nVast and bright, beholding the Eight Purities.\nTurning the wheel, one attains divine immortality,\nAs my karmic mind refines.\nReceiving retribution without limit,\nWith resolve fixed, one enters the court of blessing.\nThe thirty-two marks of excellence,\nAll shine forth from within the body.\nThe nape bears the light of the Seven Treasures,\nIlluminating the forms of all heavens.\nSwift as clouds, the Eight Radiant Chariots,\nWhirling winds carry the green canopy.\nAscending into the Gate of the Profound Mysterious,\nThis joy knows no end.\n\n**The Dao Speaks:**\nThese three gāthās emerged before the Primordial Beginning, across countless kalpas. When the Dao perfected heaven and earth, its merit aided all things. Their teachings are subtle and wondrous, vast and boundless, imparted only to lofty immortals and great sages, the perfected beings of the ten directions who have attained the immortal Dao—not to middling immortals.\n\nThose who behold these texts, revere and uphold them, shall find joy in life and death, no longer traverse the Three Paths, nor tread the Eight Difficulties. In this world, they shall know wealth and nobility, their households at peace, their descendants wise and virtuous. Sons and daughters shall be bright and fair, endowed with wisdom, kindness, and dignity. Myriad evils shall vanish, a thousand disasters shall not touch them. Death shall part them from hell, sparing them the trials of Mount Tai. They shall ascend directly to the hall of blessing, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally. Their wheel of rebirth shall not cease, bound to good karmic conditions.\n\nIf one can maintain long fasts, cultivate practice and contemplate the true, uphold the Dharma and observe precepts, empty the mind and delve into the mysterious, expand salvation and relieve the distressed, deliver the destitute, bestow kindness and disperse virtue, serve and honor teachers and ancestors, meet their gaze with joy, endure hardship and cold alike—when merit is complete and virtue perfected, after death one shall become an immortal. Roaming the great void, one shall ascend into the midst of the Eight Gates.",

      "translated_text": "The Supreme Perfected of the Mysterious Unity Speaks the Sutra of Admonitions on the Three Paths and Five Sufferings\n\n#1 The Dao spoke: Within the formless chaos, I surveyed the boundless qi of the heavens, countless in number. The rise and fall of heaven and earth, the retributions of life and death—none lack their counterparts, none lack their return. As heaven and earth revolve, the four seasons alternate in decline and renewal. The radiance of the sun and moon waxes and wanes, extinguishing and rebirthing in cycles. Humans, born of qi, possess intentions refined or coarse, conduct right or wrong. Their aspirations shape their form, while their deluded traces persist. Merit and transgression are recorded without the slightest omission, all made manifest before heaven and earth, their principles distinctly apportioned.\n\nThus, the dead are numberless, yet rebirth does not cease. All revolve through the turning of souls and spirits, endlessly returning, none but their former selves, cycling without end. Therefore, within the formless void, I opened the Eight Gates for all future lives, establishing the Dharma Wheel to instruct the ignorant, admonish through karmic conditions, and deliver the myriad beings.\n\nNow, as the Dao is cultivated and the practice of non-action attained, one knows their past lives and achieves utmost perfection. Yet I now behold beings from the boundless worlds beyond the Eight Gates—like grains of dust they come—common folk, men and women, learned and unlearned, heedless of their past lives, violating precepts and transgressing laws. They die in agony, dragged through the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, no longer retaining human form, all enduring the retribution for the evils of their former lives, receiving their due in this present existence.\n\nSeeing this, I grieve in silence, their suffering etched upon their forms, my compassion dwelling in my heart. Thus, I now turn the Dharma Wheel to deliver them. Let those who come heed this with clarity and caution, and attend to it with care.\n\n#2 The Dao spoke: I once surveyed the heavens and emerged through the Eastern Gate, where I beheld common folk, men and women, their mouths and faces festering with pus and blood, stinking and oozing. Their necks hung like threads, their bellies swelled like drums. Iron awls pierced their bodies, fire filled their mouths. Young and old dragged one another through burning coals, no longer human in form. Their feet trod upon blades, their bodies bore iron rods—pain unbearable, agony unendurable.\n\nGrieving for them, my compassion knew no bounds. The Dao asked: What crimes have these people committed? What karmic conditions from their past lives, what transgressions in their conduct, what sins have they accumulated to incur such retribution, such torment?\n\nA flying immortal of the Eastern Realm replied: These are sinners. In their former lives, they wielded malicious speech and venomous tongues, slandered the Dao and virtue, assailed their masters and teachers, and engaged in mutual defamation. Some wantonly killed and harmed, heedless of sentient beings, practicing cruelty and oppression. Their hearts harbored dark malice, slaughtering without restraint. Envious of those superior to them, they suppressed the worthy and wise. Thus, they have summoned this retribution, enduring every suffering. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn in the paths of non-human beings. Such are their karmic causes.\n\nThe Dao said: Let these beings reflect upon their past deeds, contemplate goodness, and enter the Dharma Wheel. Let them receive admonitions, be reborn among humans, and cultivate this Dao of mine to resolve their past retributions. Let them aspire to practice the Dao, widely open the Dharma gates, and establish fields of merit. When their merit is complete and their virtue perfected, they shall ascend into the Eastern Gate, behold the roots of their past lives, and receive deliverance, attaining the rank of flying immortals.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I once surveyed the heavens and emerged through the Western Gate, where I beheld common folk, men and women, with ox heads and beastly bodies, their tongues pulled out and pierced with iron awls. Mighty celestial enforcers beat them ceaselessly with iron rods, their bodies festering, no longer human in form. Their feet stood upon mountains of blades—pain unbearable, agony unendurable.\n\nSeeing this, I grieved without end. The Dao asked: What crimes have these people committed? What karmic conditions from their past lives, what fundamental transgressions have they committed to incur such retribution, such torment?\n\nA flying immortal of the Western Realm replied: These are sinners. In their former lives, they acted without the Dao, defied their masters’ commands, and slighted the Three Treasures. Their words belied their hearts; they undermined their roots and assailed their superiors. They cursed and swore, invoking gods and ghosts. They drank to excess, indulging in greed and desire without restraint. Some slandered the good and praised the wicked, defamed the worthy, flattered and harmed the loyal and virtuous, and took lives. The grievances of their victims cried out endlessly. Such grave sins have summoned this retribution, enduring every suffering. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn in the frontier lands of barbarians, possessing human form but lacking human sentiment. Such are their karmic causes.\n\nThe Dao said: Let these beings reflect upon their past deeds, contemplate their sufferings, and reform to do good. Let them enter the Dharma Wheel, receive admonitions, and be reborn in the Central Kingdom. Let them cultivate this Dao of mine to resolve their past retributions, aspire to do good, and widely establish fields of merit. Let them receive deliverance, enter my Western Gate, and behold the celestial beings enjoying the fruits of their meritorious deeds, eternally partaking of boundless retribution.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I once surveyed the heavens and emerged through the Southern Gate, where I beheld common folk, men and women, naked and unclothed, swallowing fire and eating coals, burned by flames. Their heads and faces were scorched, their entire bodies festering, no longer human in form. They wore iron cauldrons upon their heads, their feet resting upon mountains of fire—pain unbearable, torment unfit to behold.\n\nSeeing this, I grieved, my compassion dwelling in my heart. The Dao asked: From whence did these beings arise? What past lives gave them birth? What karmic conditions, what unlawful deeds have they committed to incur such retribution, such torment?\n\nA flying immortal of the Southern Realm replied: These sinners, in their former lives, wielded divisive speech and double tongues, slandered Daoists, and assailed the worthy. They were neither filial nor kind, neither benevolent nor loyal. They cursed and insulted their parents, and their six relations harmed one another. Some boiled and slaughtered livestock, cruelly taking animal lives, roasting and devouring them for momentary pleasure, heedless of their past lives. Others became butchers, slaughtering and dismembering countless beings. Such fundamental transgressions have summoned this retribution, enduring every suffering.",

      "translated_text": "After ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn among the six kinds of livestock to repay their former enmities—such are their karmic causes.\n\nThe Dao said: Might these beings be allowed to reform their past conduct, reflect upon goodness, and enter the Wheel of Dharma? Thus may they be reborn among men, receive admonitions, cultivate a heart of compassion, and widely establish merit. Then, having undergone deliverance, they may enter our Southern Gate, behold the hosts of heaven, and partake in the blessings of good deeds, forming karmic bonds with virtue.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I have often surveyed the heavens and, journeying through the Northern Gate, beheld common folk—men and women—naked and bare, young and old alike, dragging one another into cauldrons of boiling broth. Their bodies steep in scalding liquid, drenched in a hundred poisons, flesh rotting from their bones, suffering beyond endurance. Then they are cast into icy springs or thrust into the Northern Hell, where their necks and feet are shackled in cangues, their bodies subjected to torture. Confined in dark, heavy cages, they see not the three lights.\n\nThe Dao asked: From whence do these beings come? Through which gate were they born? With what have they formed karmic bonds? What deities have they offended? Though men incur retribution, how can such cruelty be so extreme? It is most pitiable.\n\nA flying immortal of the Northern Realm replied: These sinners, in their former lives, slew their lords and fathers, plotted rebellion against their masters, and murdered men. Some, relying on strength, oppressed the weak, betrayed friends, and assailed the virtuous. They lodged false accusations with officials, ensnaring the innocent in unjust lawsuits. Their grievances filled the heavens. Some exposed themselves beneath the three lights, defiling and insulting the lords of the age. Others destroyed quiet abodes, temples, and halls of governance. Some stole scriptures, transmitting them without vows, or cast doubt upon orthodox texts, slandering sacred writings. Some burned heavenly scriptures, showing contempt for the numinous and true. Such grave transgressions have summoned this retribution, enduring every torment.\n\nAfter ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn among the six kinds of livestock, or as lowly men, deaf, blind, or afflicted with the six maladies, their forms no longer human—such are their karmic causes.\n\nThe Dao said: Might these beings reflect upon their past conduct, reform their hearts, and turn to goodness? Let them be instructed in the Wheel of Dharma, receive admonitions, and be reborn in the human realm. Let them submit to precepts, cultivate the Dao anew, undergo deliverance, and enter our Northern Gate. There, beholding their past lives, they may come to know the utmost truth.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I have often surveyed the heavens and, journeying through the Northeast Gate, beheld common folk—men and women—with shaven heads and iron collars, shackled and burdened with mountains and stones. They tread back and forth upon beds of iron needles, denied rest day or night. Young and old follow one another in uncountable numbers, their suffering as bitter as mud and ashes, unbearable to witness.\n\nThe Dao asked: By what karmic cause were these beings born? Through which gate did they enter life? What sins have they accumulated? What deities have they offended to incur such retribution, enduring such torment? When shall their bodies, wracked by torture, find release?\n\nA flying immortal of the Northeast Realm replied: These sinners, in their former lives, abused their wealth and power to oppress the poor and lowly, forcibly seizing property and taking lives. Some became bandits, attacking one another, or robbed men of their beloved, violated the wives and concubines of others, and separated mothers from their children. Some committed incest among the six relations, defiling their own kin. Such grave transgressions have summoned this retribution.\n\nAfter enduring three rounds of torture, they shall be reborn among cattle and horses—such are their karmic causes.\n\nThe Dao, beholding them with sorrow and pity, addressed the flying immortal: Let these beings reflect upon their past lives and the transgressions they committed. Let them reform now, form karmic bonds with virtue, and escape this calamity. Let them cultivate merit, widely establish fields of blessing to atone for past wrongs, and receive admonitions. Then, delivered through the Northeast Gate, they may behold the multitude of good deeds, know the roots of their fate, and, with the Wheel of Rebirth unceasing, enter the boundless realm.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I have often surveyed the heavens and, journeying through the Southwest Gate, beheld common folk—men and women—naked and bare, embracing copper pillars. The pillars bore fiery needles that pierced their backs and bellies. Beasts of Mount Tai devoured their flesh as they stood upon iron grates. Young and old were dragged along, their human forms lost, their suffering as bitter as mud and ashes, unbearable to witness.\n\nThe Dao asked: What transgressions have these beings committed? What karmic causes bind them? What fundamental crimes have they wrought to incur such punishment? How many years of torment must they endure before release?\n\nA flying immortal of the Southwest Realm replied: These sinners, in their former lives, forcibly seized the food of others, cut short lives for profit, borrowed without repayment, and deceived men of their possessions. Relying on strength, they bullied the weak, their greed insatiable. When they obtained what they desired, they rejoiced; when they failed, they grew resentful, seizing opportunities to strike others and vent their malice. Some showed contempt for their elders, mocked the poor and sick, or exposed themselves, offending the three lights. They disrespected heaven and earth, feared neither ghosts nor spirits. Such grave transgressions have summoned this retribution, repaying their past enmities.\n\nAfter ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn as lowly servants—such are their karmic causes.\n\nThe Dao, beholding them with sorrow and endless pity, addressed the flying immortal: Let these beings reflect upon their past lives, reform their hearts, and turn to goodness. Let them cultivate the Dao anew, widely establish merit to dispel past enmities, and receive admonitions. Then, delivered through the Southwest Gate, they may behold the multitude of good deeds, know the consequences of sin and blessing, and, with the Wheel of Rebirth unceasing, enter the Dao of Non-Action.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I have often surveyed the heavens and, journeying through the Southeast Gate, beheld common folk—men and women—with shaven heads and iron collars, confined in dark, heavy cages. They saw not the three lights, but dwelt within the Five Peaks, where they were tortured thrice daily with iron rods, their beatings uncountable. Once their sentences were fixed, their souls were condemned to death, their bodies lashed and cast into the mountains to fill rivers and seas with earth and stone. Young and old were dragged along, enduring the five sufferings, their torment as bitter as mud and ashes, unbearable to witness.",

      "translated_text": "The Dao spoke: What karmic conditions bind these souls? What deeds in past lives have led them here? Which divine laws did they transgress? Who is born without sin, yet they alone suffer thus?\n\nA celestial being of the Southeast Realm replied: These sinners in former lives took life and made wanton sacrifices, feeding shamans and demons. They mocked Daoist masters, slandered Perfected Ones, abandoned the true Law for falsehood, betrayed their teachers and the Dao, and cursed the virtuous. With disheveled hair, they raised their faces to the heavens, crying out to gods in blasphemous rites, seeking to kill others through dark invocations. Some scorned the sun and moon, reviled the stars, or devised their own heretical teachings, refusing to believe in past lives. Others destroyed mountains and dammed springs, blocking the paths of spirits, or desecrated graves, stealing burial garments, exposing bones to the wilds. They ridiculed those who did good, claimed their own ways were right, envied their betters, and harbored secret malice. Their sins are grave, and thus they face this retribution. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn among the lowly, afflicted by the six extremes, bearing crippling diseases or lifelong infirmities, repaying their past transgressions. Such are their causes.\n\nThe Dao, seeing this, was filled with sorrow and pity. To the celestial being, the Dao said: Let these souls reform their past conduct, reflect on their past lives, and cultivate goodness in this life. Let them establish merit, broaden their fields of blessing, and through sincere and earnest effort, atone for their former faults. Let them form a bond with the Dao, pass through the Southeast Gate, receive admonitions, and renew their virtuous deeds. Thus may they be reborn among humankind, learn to deliver all beings, and forge a karmic link with the Dao.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I have often surveyed the heavens and, journeying through the Northwest Gate, beheld common folk—men and women—with shaven heads and severed locks, climbing sword trees where winds from all eight directions blow the branches up and down. Below, their feet tread upon blade mountains, back and forth without end. Their hands and feet are torn and mangled, pus and blood flowing forth, unbearable to witness, their pain beyond endurance.\n\nThe Dao asked: What crimes have these souls committed? What past deeds have brought them here? Which scriptures or precepts did they violate to suffer such cruelty?\n\nA celestial being of the Northwest Realm replied: These sinners in former lives were vain and covetous, chasing fame and profit. Outwardly, they feigned devotion to the teachings, but hoarded treasures and refused to receive the scriptures. Though they accepted the texts, their faith was half-hearted, their minds gripped by stinginess. Before mastering the scriptures, they presumptuously styled themselves as teachers, ignoring the required years of study. They transmitted the teachings to disciples without celestial or terrestrial sanction, lacking sacred vows, passing them on carelessly. Those who received the texts were irreverent; those who bestowed them were negligent. They revealed secret texts, spreading them among the vulgar, causing the foolish to blame and slander the true Dao and revile the sacred scriptures. Some received the scriptures with impurity and disdain, slighting the Three Treasures, disregarding their teachers’ instructions, and following their own whims. Others observed precepts carelessly, their thoughts wandering. Their sins are grave, and thus they face this retribution. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall be reborn among the most foolish, forever cut off from the Dao, or afflicted by the six illnesses—deafness, blindness, and dullness. Such are their causes.\n\nThe Dao, seeing this, was filled with sorrow and pity. To the celestial being, the Dao said: Though these souls violated the precepts, they once entered the gateway of the Law. Let them reflect on the evil of their past conduct and turn their thoughts to goodness. Let them establish merit, submit to their teachers’ guidance, and pass through the Northwest Gate to receive admonitions. Thus may they be reborn among humankind, receive the sacred scriptures anew, diligently practice the great work, and when their merit is complete and their virtue widespread, ascend to the realm of the Perfected.\n\nThe Dao spoke: I open the Eight Gates to observe all beings from afar. I see common folk—men and women, learned and unlearned—heedless of past lives, committing every manner of primordial evil, overturning heaven and earth, sparing nothing in their transgressions. When their sins are complete, their souls are condemned to the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties, where they are tortured and beaten, their pain and poison boundless. Young and old are dragged along, mired in suffering, bound for kalpas without release. My sorrow and pity cannot be stilled.\n\nThus do I open the way to deliverance, offering admonitions that they may reflect on goodness and recall the sins of their past lives. Let them reform their conduct, inwardly embrace the Wheel of the Law, and swiftly attain rebirth among humankind. There, let them perform great merit, bestow kindness and charity, broaden their fields of blessing, revere their teachers and the sacred texts, and cultivate filial devotion. When their merit is complete and their virtue perfected, let them atone for past transgressions, receive blessings, enter the Dao’s realm, and awaken to their past lives, thus attaining Perfection.\n\nThis Law is vast and universal; its merit extends to all. Those who see these words shall, by their innate roots, liberate themselves, escape the Five Sufferings, be freed from the Three Paths, and forever leave the Eight Difficulties. In this life, they shall know peace; in every life, wealth and nobility; their families shall prosper. Reflecting on past lives, they shall form bonds with goodness.\n\nIf one observes perpetual fasting, burns incense, and performs prostrations, widely saves all beings, aids the multitude, practices self-sacrificing generosity, does what others cannot do, bears what others cannot bear, and cultivates all deeds in accord with the Law, they shall ascend as immortals, riding clouds and dragons, soaring through the heavens.\n\n*Verse on the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and the Rootless Fate*\n\nI journey through the Eight Gates,\nSurveying the heavens without limit.\nIn boundless worlds, I intimately know all karmic threads.\nI see common folk—men and women—\nWretched souls wailing, dragged through the Eight Difficulties.\nThey swallow fire and eat coals, bear stones and climb mountains.\nThey tread upon sword trees, where wind and blades assail them.\nTheir bodies are torn and broken, no longer human in form.\nSeeing this, I grieve, overcome with sorrow.\nI ask: What crimes have they committed? What past deeds bind them?\nBound to this retribution, they know not their karmic roots.\nLost, they cannot reform, sinking into the causes of sin.\nI think of you through kalpas, enduring every suffering.\nThe Three Lights are forever veiled; their hidden pain is unspeakable.",

When the Dao perfected heaven and earth, its merit aided all things. Their teachings are subtle and wondrous, vast and boundless, imparted only to lofty immortals and great sages, the perfected beings of the ten directions who have attained the immortal Dao—not to middling immortals.\n\nThose who behold these texts, revere and uphold them, shall find joy in life and death, no longer traverse the Three Paths, nor tread the Eight Difficulties. In this world, they shall know wealth and nobility, their households at peace, their descendants wise and virtuous. Sons and daughters shall be bright and fair, endowed with wisdom, kindness, and dignity. Myriad evils shall vanish, a thousand disasters shall not touch them. Death shall part them from hell, sparing them the trials of Mount Tai. They shall ascend directly to the hall of blessing, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally. Their wheel of rebirth shall not cease, bound to good karmic conditions.\n\nIf one can maintain long fasts, cultivate practice and contemplate the true, uphold the Dharma and observe precepts, empty the mind and delve into the mysterious, expand salvation and relieve the distressed, deliver the destitute, bestow kindness and disperse virtue, serve and honor teachers and ancestors, meet their gaze with joy, endure hardship and cold alike—when merit is complete and virtue perfected, after death one shall become an immortal. Roaming the great void, one shall ascend into the midst of the Eight Gates.",
