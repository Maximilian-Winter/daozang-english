  "full_translation": "**The Wondrous Manifestations of the Divine Transformations of Lord Pure Yang**\n\n**Sutra Title:** *The Wondrous Manifestations of the Divine Transformations of Lord Pure Yang*\nSeven fascicles. Compiled by Miao Shanshi of the Yuan dynasty.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, category of *Dongzhen* hagiographies and records.\n\n**Preface to *The Wondrous Manifestations of the Divine Transformations of Lord Pure Yang***\n\nThe Dao, at times, employs divine transformations to guide the worldly, or remedies to succor the virtuous. Yielding and adapting, it responds with expedient means—great compassion and boundless transformation—gathering the myriad beings to return to the One Source. Utmost aspiration and perfect benevolence embrace all virtues without clinging to any single one.\n\nTo awaken to the unceasingness of the non-empty, to comprehend the mystery of primordial arising—such subtleties defy exhaustive speech. To grasp their essence through conjecture is as distant as attempting to measure thought with intellect; only through sincere devotion and silent communion may they be realized.\n\nUndeterred by my shallow insight, I have gleaned from the scriptures, gathered from Tang and Song histories and biographies, and compiled verified accounts, stripping away embellishments to weave one hundred and twenty transformations into six fascicles. Each chapter concludes with harmonizing poems and lyrics, presented in straightforward exposition, entitled *The Wondrous Manifestations of the Divine Transformations*.\n\nMay those of kindred spirit, upon opening this volume, perceive the celestial patterns, silently apprehend the subtleties of the Dao, and attain luminous comprehension of the Primordial Ultimate, penetrating the profound mystery.\n\nLord Pure Yang’s perfect and wondrous penetration of the Dao, his attainment of the primordial spring of the precelestial, is beyond my humble capacity to compile. Yet with reverent intent, I offer this work to the discerning, that they may reflect upon nature’s spontaneity, avoid deviant paths, and proceed directly to the celestial thoroughfare.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Miao Shanshi, the Elder of Central Harmony of Jinling.\n\n**Imperial Edict**\n\nThe Emperor proclaims: The Great Dao unfolds its name, effecting transformations through primordial potency. The Perfect Real abides in freedom, achieving the work of non-interference.\n\nOur ancestral line has established this foundation. Revering the illustrious eras of old, We have long admired the mystic wind. From the lingering teachings of Chonghua to the dawning dispensation of Chongyang, the true has remained undimmed, transmitted across generations. Responses arise and resonate, though the origin be distant and unattainable.\n\nThough previous dynasties have repeatedly bestowed honors, in Our heart, We still deem such tributes insufficient. Thus, We command the scholar-officials to confer exalted titles: let Chonghua be styled *Emperor* and *Lord*, with the addition of *Purple Palace* and *Lesser Yang*. As for Zhengyang, Pure Yang, and Haichan, let them be granted the title *Perfected Lord*; the Seven Perfected below shall be styled *Perfected Ones*, their names inscribed in the annals to be transmitted for ten thousand generations.\n\nAlas! In the Han, Zhang Daoling was granted the title *Celestial Master*, and in the Tang, Ye Fashan likewise—such honors have ever been the glory of the Dao’s lineage. In this age, no dissenting voices shall arise; let this be established as a fixed institution. In this, perhaps Our aspirations may be fulfilled.\n\nLet the *Teaching Master of Donghua* be posthumously honored as *Emperor Lord of Donghua, Purple Palace, and Lesser Yang*. Let *Perfected Lord Zhongli of Zhengyang* be posthumously honored as *Perfected Lord of Zhengyang, Awakening, and Transmission of the Dao*. Let *Perfected Lord Lü of Chunyang* be posthumously honored as *Perfected Lord of Chunyang, Propagation of Rectitude, and Edification*. Let *Perfected Lord Liu of Haichan* be posthumously honored as *Perfected Lord of Haichan, Illumination, and Vast Transmission of the Dao*. Let *Perfected Lord Wang of Chongyang* be posthumously honored as *Perfected Lord of Chongyang, Quanzhen, and Initiation of Transformation*. Let this be executed by *Perfected Lord Zhang Zhijing*, *Holder of the Teaching*, *Embodier of the Dao*, *Sincere and Illuminated*.\n\nBy decree of the *August Emperor, Favored by Heaven* on a day in the first month of the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era.\n\nOf old, it was heard that the *Supreme* expounded the teaching of *Quanzhen*, aligning with the constancy of Heaven and Earth, and following the great harmony of yin and yang. From the transformations and manifestations of Donghua to the bequeathal of teachings for posterity, from the Han to the Tang, only after ages would a *Perfected One* emerge. At the juncture of Jin succeeding Song, in this flourishing dynasty, the *Mystic Lineage* was restored. Manifesting the gate of manifold wonders, it was anchored in the primordial simplicity of the *Original Name*. Some, transcending form through insight, immersed themselves in the *Spiritual Pivot*; others, harnessing stars and riding dragons, soared through the *Purple Ultimate*. Unheard, unseen, they alone companioned with the *Creator*, departing in serene freedom.\n\nYet it is also said: *They appear in response to the times.* Now, their legacy is transmitted to descendants, and their wondrous deeds are extolled as *Primal Merit*. Thus, let ranks be conferred in succession, that the *Lineage’s Wind* may be perpetuated. Apart from the *Founding Ancestor, Emperor Lord Donghua*, who shall be separately venerated, let the rest be uniformly implemented as follows:\n\nLet *Perfected Lord Zhongli of Zhengyang, Awakening, and Transmission of the Dao* be further honored as *Emperor Lord of Zhengyang, Awakening, Transmission of the Dao, and Bequeathal of Teachings*. Let *Perfected Lord Lü of Chunyang, Propagation of Rectitude, and Edification* be further honored as *Emperor Lord of Chunyang, Propagation of Rectitude, Edification, and Blessed Protection*. Let *Perfected Lord Liu of Haichan, Illumination, and Vast Transmission of the Dao* be further honored as *Emperor Lord of Haichan, Illumination, Vast Transmission of the Dao, and Pure Protection*. Let *Perfected Lord Wang of Chongyang, Quanzhen, and Initiation of Transformation* be further honored as *Emperor Lord of Chongyang, Quanzhen, Initiation of Transformation, and Assistance to the Ultimate*.\n\nThis is hereby entrusted to *Miao Daoyi*, *Grand Master of the Mystic Gate, Propagator of the Dao, Holder of the Teaching, Harmonizer, Upholder of Rectitude, Illuminated and Unadorned Perfected One*, for execution.\n\nOn a day in the second month of the third year of the Zhida era.\n*Record of the Divine Transformations and Wondrous Penetrations of Emperor Lord Chunyang*, Scroll One.\n\nWithin the Mystic Gate, *Miao Shanshi* having collated and arranged the poetic images and auspicious responses, *Illuminated Original Manifestation, First Transformation*:\n\nRespectfully following the transmission of the Dao, we record that *Emperor Lord* bore the surname *Lü* and the personal name *Yan*, styled *Dongbin*, a native of *Yongle County* in *Hezhong Prefecture* during the *Tang*. His great-grandfather, *Yan zhi*, concluded his service as *Military Commissioner of Zhedong*. His grandfather, *Wei*, was of pure and virtuous disposition, his literary compositions refined and exquisite. He delighted in goodness and the Dao, accumulating abundant hidden virtue. Progressing through successive promotions, he served as *Vice Minister of Rites* and concluded his career as *Prefect of Tanzhou*, posthumously enfeoffed as *Grand Governor of Shanzhou*.\n\n*Wei* fathered four sons, each marked by warmth, reverence, frugality, and deference. The eldest, *Wen*, mastered the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and excelled in literary composition, rising at one time to *Vice Director of the Ministry of Revenue* and concluding his career as *Prefect of Hengzhou*. The second, *Gong*, esteemed moral integrity and favored strategic discourse, concluding his career as *Palace Attendant Censor*. The third, *Jian*, was endowed with many talents, advancing as *Acting Censor*. The fourth, *Rang*, was virtuous and adept in governance, rising to *Right Mentor of the Crown Prince* and concluding his career as *Prefect of Haizhou*.\n\nThe *Perfected One* was the youngest son of *Rang*. On the fourteenth day of the fourth month of the fourteenth year of the *Zhenyuan* era of *Emperor Dezong of Tang*, at the hour of *si*, witnesses beheld a white crane descend from the heavens, entering the bedchamber and vanishing from sight. His mother, then at rest, awoke from a startled dream. At that very moment, the *Perfected One* was born, an extraordinary fragrance filling the room and lingering for days without dissipating.\n\nIn his childhood, he was solemn and spoke little, disinclined to play. As he grew, his stature exceeded six *chi*. His frame bore the bones of a Daoist immortal, his phoenix eyes extending to his temples, his brows refined and nose tall, his complexion a blend of yellow and white. Beneath his left brow and beside his right eye, he bore moles the size of beans, and beneath his feet, tortoise-shell patterns subtly emerged. By nature, he was pure, sincere, benevolent, filial, and keen of wit. The Three Teachings’ scriptures he mastered with profound comprehension, often reciting the *Book of Changes*, the *Dao and Its Virtue*, and the *Scripture of the Hidden Correspondence*. He favored wearing the *Huayang* cap, a yellow or white bordered robe with a broad sash, or else the carefree garb of a scholar. Later, he refused marriage, ever cherishing clarity and tranquility, disdaining ostentation and wealth. From his earliest years, his heart was already set upon the Daoist path.\n\nThe *Xiangzhang* observes: The Great Dao is inherently possessed by all, fully manifest in every being. Yet since birth, people are assailed by worldly desires, deluded by profit and fame. Moreover, lacking good fortune and ancestral virtue, they drift ever farther from the Dao. Thus the immortal masters declare: To attain the Dao and ascend to perfection, one relies upon the profound accumulated virtue of ancestors and one’s own innate wisdom, resolute will, and steadfast resolve from past lives—this eases the path to realization. Are these empty words? This chronicle records that the *Perfected Lord* was by nature pure and sincere, benevolent, filial, and keen of wit, mastering the Three Teachings’ scriptures at a glance—surely this is the fruit of innate wisdom and resolve from past lives. His grandfather, *Governor of Shanzhou*, delighted in goodness and the Dao, his governance rich in hidden virtue; all four of his sons rose to prominence. His father, *Rang*, was pure, sincere, and benevolent, his governance earning fine repute, the people’s reverence and admiration. Thus his name reached the throne, and he was promoted to the Crown Prince’s household. Through such sincerity, he moved the hearts of true immortals, who descended in response—was this not the overflowing blessing of accumulated goodness? Since coming of age, the *Perfected Lord* refused marriage, treasuring his essence and spirit—was this not the reverence for the body, skin, and hair bequeathed by his parents? With unwavering resolve, he cultivated the true, his mind serene and nature radiant, nurturing vastness and delighting in Heaven. His name resounded through later ages—was this not the essential way of perfecting virtue to honor his parents? Moreover, he inherited the lineage of the *Mysterious Origin* and the Daoist succession, his name inscribed in the *Purple Palace* of the immortals. As the sacred teacher of Heaven and humanity, his divine transformations knew no bounds, his presence now hidden, now revealed—how could he be spoken of in the same breath as ordinary sages?\n\nSome doubt the discrepancies in various accounts regarding the *Perfected Lord*’s birthplace and residences. Upon careful examination, these stem from his father’s official postings and relocations, as well as authors’ desires to claim him for their native regions, leading to inconsistencies. Today, the old homestead at *Jiufeng Mountain* in *Yongle Town*, *Hezhong Prefecture*, remains intact, and the *Chunyang Wanshou Palace* now stands upon its foundations. *Yongle County* was redesignated a town during the *Xining* era of the Song. Though I have verified this to the best of my ability, I dare not insist upon it absolutely, hoping only to resolve doubts for those of like mind.\n\n*The Awakening from the Millet Dream: The Second Transformation*\n\nIn the fifth year of the *Yuanhe* era of Emperor Xianzong of Tang, at the age of twenty-one, he journeyed to Chang’an to sit for the imperial examinations and lodged at an inn. One day, a Daoist adept of extraordinary appearance—his features ancient and noble, his beard full and eyes bright, clad in a crane-feather cloak and long robes—entered the inn without ceremony, bowed, and took a seat. He engaged the *Perfected Lord* in conversation, seeking to guide him onto the Dao. The *Perfected Lord* replied, “Let me first secure an official post to bring glory to my ancestors and uphold our family’s reputation; then I shall follow you, Master, without delay.”\n\nThe adept smiled and asked for a simple meal. The *Perfected Lord* ordered his servant to prepare rice. Feeling weary, he was about to sleep when the adept drew a pillow from his sleeve and said, “This is a *ruyi* pillow. If you rest upon it, all your desires shall be fulfilled.” As soon as he lay down, he dreamed that a messenger arrived, summoning the top-ranked scholar Lü to receive his commission. Beginning as a local magistrate, he was swiftly promoted to the imperial court, ascending through the ranks of remonstrance officials, the Hanlin Academy, and the Secret Pavilion, holding every esteemed post in turn. He was demoted and elevated by turns, married twice into wealthy families, and saw his descendants flourish, his halls filled with scholars and officials. Thus passed nearly forty years. For the last decade, he served as sole chancellor, his power and influence overwhelming. Then, suddenly, he was charged with a grave crime: his family’s property was confiscated, his wives and children scattered, and he was exiled to the southern frontier, left destitute and emaciated. As he stood in the wind and snow, sighing in despair, he awoke with a start.\n\nThe adept, still beside him, laughed and said, “The millet is not yet cooked, yet you’ve dreamed your way to the land of *Huaxu*.” The *Perfected Lord* exclaimed in astonishment, “Do you know my dream?” The adept replied, “In the span of a single moment, you have experienced fifty years of glory and ruin, of countless joys and sorrows. What is there to rejoice in gaining, or to grieve in losing? Only when one awakens to the Great Awakening does one realize that this is but a great dream. A human life of a hundred years is likewise but a single great dream.”\n\nThe *Perfected Lord* was suddenly enlightened: “Even the highest ranks of office, halls filled with gold and jade—when viewed thus, are but the playthings of fate. What is there to cling to?” He bowed deeply and said, “Master, you are no ordinary man. I beg you to enlighten this ignorant one.” The adept replied, “Now that you have pierced the illusions of the world—its fleeting flowers, its hollow fame and profit—turning your heart toward the Dao will be easy.”\n\nThe *Perfected Lord* said, “I have had a slight awakening. As the *Yi* says of the wandering soul and the transformations of life and death, I seek the principle of exhausting one’s nature to fulfill destiny. I implore you, Master, in your compassion, to instruct me in the path of cultivation.” The adept remained silent for a long while before speaking: “When the myriad principles merge and flow, the heart becomes clear and luminous. When the seven emotions are stilled, one’s nature becomes perfectly bright. When the heart is serene and at rest, the original nature is as jade and empty—what need is there for a wandering soul to transform? The nature is one with the Great Void, silent and vast, beyond birth and extinction. What fear of life and death remains? Know that I was never born—how then can there be death?”\n\nThe *Perfected Lord* stood in bewilderment for a long time before a great clarity dawned. He bowed again in gratitude and said, “By the fortune of past lives, I have met a true immortal. Just now, hearing your compassionate words of profound meaning, I suddenly forgot my own existence.” The adept said, “What I have told you is but one aspect of the wondrous truth of exhausting one’s nature. As for the great matter of the ultimate destiny of the wise spirit, it is not yet time to transmit it—wait until you are truly free and unburdened.” The *Perfected Lord* thanked him, saying, “Who are you, Master?”\n\nThe adept replied, “My surname is Zhongli, though this is but a provisional name. My style is Yunfang. I dwell on Crane Ridge of the Seven Stars Mountain in Zhongnan. Seek me there another day.” With that, he vanished like the wind. The *Perfected Lord* said, “Though I am dismayed, I am also joyful.” The next day, he returned to his hometown.\n\n*Xiangzhang* observes: The Old Immortal of *Nanhua* was suddenly awakened by the dream of a butterfly. The *Perfected Lord of Pure Yang* was thoroughly enlightened by the dream of the millet. Thus, the *Nanhua Sutra* says: “Only when one awakens to the Great Awakening does one realize that this is a great dream.” The *Perfected Lord of Pure Yang* was suddenly and completely enlightened, seeing through the emptiness of all illusions and penetrating the One True. How profound! How sublime!\n\n**The Third Transformation: Compassionate Virtue and Hidden Merit**\nUpon returning to his hometown, the *Perfected Lord* encountered a famine. He sold all his property and grain to relieve the starving poor, saving nearly twenty or thirty thousand lives. The elders and relatives of his village rejoiced but also urged him to retain some wealth for the sake of his descendants. The *Perfected Lord* sighed and said, “The fault of humanity lies in the heart. Deluded and confused about one’s original nature, one becomes attached to illusory things, clinging to wealth and possessions, giving rise to greed, anger, hatred, love, and sinking into the bitter realms of suffering. I do not presume to rebuke my kin, but having had a slight awakening, I find nothing worth clinging to.” He composed a poem to show his village elders and relatives:\n\n*I’ve shattered the embroidered gourd, trampled the zither underfoot,*\n*And with a flick of my sleeve, left the world of scholars behind.*\n*The Great Beginning’s true form is pure as jade,*\n*The Primordial True Suchness gleams like gold.*\n*Cinnabar flames rise to the heavens, beyond the ken of gods,*\n*The sword’s edge pierces the earth, eluding even ghosts.*\n*Since awakening from the millet dream,*\n*I know all my past efforts were in vain.*\n\nLater, he bid farewell to his hometown and set out alone for Zhongnan Mountain to seek his master, though none could dissuade him.\n\nXiangzhang remarked: When the Perfected One took leave of his kin during a famine, he gathered all his property and grain to relieve the starving poor, saving some twenty or thirty thousand lives. The village elders and relatives, moved by gratitude and respect, urged him to preserve his wealth for his descendants. The Perfected One sighed and said: “What people lose is their own minds. Deluded and ignorant of their true nature, they cling to illusory things, hoard wealth, and so give rise to anger, vexation, love, and sinking into the bitter realms of suffering. I do not presume to rebuke my esteemed kin, but having thoroughly awakened to the dreamlike nature of existence, I see that this body is but a temporary vessel—how then could worldly possessions be worth clinging to?”\n\nThereupon, he composed this poem to bid farewell and enter the Dao. How extraordinary! I have examined this poem and, for the benefit of like-minded seekers, appended my annotations:\n\n*I’ve shattered the embroidered gourd, trampled the zither underfoot,*\n*Crushed the illusory form, dissolved the sounds and sights like melting ice.*\n*With a flick of my sleeve, I left the world of scholars behind,*\n*Swept aside the net of fame and profit, transcended the thicket of right and wrong.*\n*The Great Beginning’s true form is pure as jade,*\n*Flawless Dharma-body, perfectly luminous and indestructible.*\n*The Primordial True Suchness gleams like gold,*\n*Ever ancient, ever present, eternally unchanging.*\n*Cinnabar flames rise to the heavens, beyond mortal mockery,*\n*Radiant wisdom illumines all, its transformations boundless.*\n*The sword’s edge pierces the earth, eluding even ghosts,*\n*Profound wisdom lies hidden, unseen by demons and spirits.*\n*Since awakening from the millet dream,*\n*Both dream and waking are empty—only the true spirit remains undimmed.*\n*Now I know all my past efforts were in vain:*\n*Ten years of literary pursuits like painted cakes,*\n*Three examinations’ labors like fleeting blossoms.*\n\nPitiful are those who, in their ignorance, take this poem and alter four lines—changing “awakening” to “seeing” and “millet” to “yellow dragon”—as if such wordplay were meaningful. The Perfected One’s flying sword severed the yellow dragon—how foolish! As the Perfected One’s verse declares: *“A grain of millet holds the world, a mustard seed contains Mount Sumeru, a cauldron boils mountains and rivers.”* This echoes the Sixth Patriarch’s *“Kalpa-fire burns the ocean’s depths”*—all metaphors for the wondrous subtlety of the wisdom-life of true emptiness, like the prajñā of the Vedas, the language of wisdom. How could such truths be reduced to the prattling of village sorcerers, the tangled vines of idle chatter? To deceive the ignorant with such nonsense—what is the intent?\n\nIt is like the blazing Buddha subduing the Nine Luminaries. Yet the Nine Luminaries—celestial bodies since time immemorial—follow their celestial paths with precise degrees and measures, not a hair’s breadth awry.\n\nMoreover, Jupiter’s radiant splendor in a person’s fate bestows wealth, nobility, intelligence, benevolence, and pure goodness—what crime could warrant the Buddha’s descent upon it? If such a descent truly occurred, the celestial bodies would cease their measured revolutions, and the very workings of creation would unravel. How absurd! The Buddha’s wisdom is lofty and luminous—he would only laugh at such deception. To slander the stars of heaven and defame the immortals and sages of China—such men reap their due retribution without exception. How pitiful their delusion, their blindness to the harm they bring!\n\nThus the *Records of the Perfected One’s Divine Transformations* states: *“My wisdom-sword severs the Three Corpses and Six Thieves, rebuking the obstructions of anger, attachment, desire, and affliction—how could I take a man’s head?”* Moreover, what enmity did Master Chao of the Chan school bear me? As Master Zhu Wengong said: *“The noble man, though benevolent, still masters himself; how could immortals ever take a man’s head?”* How true!\n\nOur teachings, as recorded in the *Sutra of Western Transformation*, contain over thirty accounts of such events. Thus Emperor Renzong of Song praised: *“He binds the teachings of Confucius; the Golden Immortal transforms the West.”* Furthermore, the Perfected Han initiated Chan Master Hui into the Dao, making him the Perfected Master Feng; the Perfected One of Ziyang initiated Chan Master Daoguang into the Dao, making him the Perfected Master Zishen. The Venerable Lü also guided over ten virtuous monks into the Way—all verifiable truths. Our tradition neither boasts nor exalts itself. Yet those who cling to self and others craftily fabricate distortions to conceal the truth. Even some of their own masters have studied under Chan monks—how laughable!\n\n*First Fascicle of the Records of the Wondrous Transformations of the Perfected Lord of Pure Yang Concluded*\n*Second Fascicle of the Records of the Wondrous Transformations of the Perfected Lord of Pure Yang*\n\nWithin the Gate of Mystery, Miao Shanshi collated and arranged the poetic imagery. The Fourth Transformation: Trials by the Five Demons.\n\nAs the Perfected Lord prepared to leave his hometown, he suddenly saw all his family stricken with illness and dead. His heart remained unmoved by sorrow, yet he prepared the funeral rites. Suddenly, those who had died rose without ailment—this was the first trial.\n\nOne night, dozens of bandits appeared, each brandishing blades and cudgels, demanding his wealth. In moments, all the treasures of his household were plundered and gone. The Perfected Lord remained utterly composed, allowing them to take what they wished—this was the second trial.\n\nNext, as he bid farewell to his village, he lost his way after a few leagues. Dusk fell, and in the distance, he saw a light. Approaching, he found two thatched huts. An old man emerged, carrying fishing nets. The Perfected Lord stepped forward, bowed, and asked for lodging. The old man replied, “I live alone and must fish by night.” After repeated refusals, he finally opened the door, saying, “Scholar, rest here. I go to fetch fish.” He instructed the Perfected Lord to bolt the door. In an instant, a woman of about twenty knocked, calling out. Assuming her to be the old man’s kin, the Perfected Lord opened the door. The woman entered with a bundle, bowed, and said, “Scholar, I lost my way in the night and seek shelter.” The Perfected Lord replied, “This is not my home. I, too, am a guest here, lodging with the fisherman. I dare not offer you shelter.” The woman said, “We are both travelers—why refuse me a single night? The hour is late, the darkness deep; I cannot go on.” She employed every art of seduction, adding, “My family owns boundless fields and wealth. I carry gold and treasures—why not take me as your wife? I would not wrong you.” The Perfected Lord sat in silence, unmoved, enduring her every ploy. At dawn, he opened his eyes to find himself seated beneath a great tree. He smiled to himself and rose to continue his journey—this was the third trial.\n\nNext, he came to a ferry crossing. Spring floods had swollen the waters, and a small boat approached. He sought passage, and as the boat reached midstream, a black wind arose, followed by towering waves, thunder, lightning, and torrential rain. The boat tossed violently, nearly capsizing. The Perfected Lord closed his eyes and sat in deep meditation, resigned to life or death, his heart as steadfast as Mount Tai. As they neared the shore, the boat overturned and sank, but he managed to reach land. When asked why, he only smiled and did not answer—this was the fourth trial.\n\nThat night, he lodged at an inn. Around the third watch, strange and monstrous forms appeared—countless ghosts and spirits, some intent on beating him, others on killing him. The Perfected Lord sat in majestic stillness, ignoring them all. Soon, several yakshas dragged forward a prisoner, bloodied and wailing, brandishing a sword. “You killed me in a past life,” it cried. “Today, you must repay my life!” The Perfected Lord replied, “If I took your life, then I should repay it. What more is there to say?” He bared his neck, ready for the blow. Suddenly, a rebuke rang out from the void, and the ghosts and spirits scattered. A man clapped his hands and laughed, saying, “I am Zhongli Quan of Cloud Chamber. I have long lamented that true immortals are rare, and the dust-bound hearts of men are hard to extinguish. My search for one who seeks the Dao surpasses even their desire to find me. Thus, I tested you five times, and you remained unmoved. You are fit to be taught. Yet your merit and conduct are not yet complete. For now, I will teach you the secret method of refining cinnabar and gold, so you may aid others. When your merit is full, I will come to deliver you.” The Perfected Lord said, “I have received the oral instructions for alchemy.” He then asked, “Once refined, will these substances change over time?” Zhongli Quan replied, “After three thousand years, they will revert to their original form.” The Perfected Lord sighed and said, “Then this would mislead people three thousand years hence. I do not wish to do this.” Zhongli Quan said, “With such a heart, your three thousand eight hundred merits are already complete.” The imagery concludes: “The depths of human appearance and emotion are most difficult to fathom. Thus, the *Nanhua Sutra* states: ‘Test a man with ten trials to know his true nature.’ The *Book of Changes* speaks of four grades of speech to discern sincerity or deceit. How much more so for those who cultivate the Dao and seek to become great sages? It is no trifling matter. Thus, the *Sacred Scriptures* say: ‘The more one takes things lightly, the more difficulties arise.’ Even sages find this hard—how much more so for us? Yet observe our kind: adversity stirs anger, prosperity brings joy. The dust of worldly thoughts, the breath of common air, old habits and familiar paths—all govern our actions. We are bound by the nature of blood and qi, yet to unlearn the nature of custom is no small task. Not a hair’s breadth has changed, yet we boast grandly, our words vast and empty, our demeanor haughty, brows raised, eyes glaring. We wave our dusters, brandish our staffs, clench our fists, point our fingers, shout and bellow, rave and rage—every manner of affectation. And we call this our ‘original, heavenly nature,’ a sudden, complete transcendence! This is nothing but clutching filth and crying injustice, covering one’s ears to steal a bell—self-deception of the deepest kind. How pitiful! The Perfected Lord of Primordial Yang subjected himself to trials of demons and favorable circumstances, yet the Perfected Lord of Pure Yang’s heart remained as jade and void, unshakable. Even when offered the art of alchemy to establish merit, he refused. Was this not fitting? The Perfected Lord of Primordial Yang clapped his hands in delight and received him as his disciple.\n\nWe, with our careless minds and trivial virtues, seek only self-liberation. Hearing of these trials and remaining unmoved—how can we not tremble with awe?”\n\nThe Fifth Transformation: Divine Manifestations and the Transmission of Scriptures.\n\nThe Perfected Master of Primordial Yang said, “I dwell in the Cave Heaven of Crane Ridge on Mount Zhongnan. Would you follow me there?” The Perfected Lord of Pure Yang replied, “I would gladly attend your phoenix carriage, Master.” Taking the True Man’s hand, they set forth. After but a few steps, all became hazy, and a gust of wind carried them across mountains and rivers. In an instant, they arrived at Crane Ridge. Before the cave, two tigers stood guard. The Master rebuked them, and they departed. Soon, the gates opened, revealing celestial guards in attendance. Amidst auspicious clouds and mist, jade terraces and golden halls gleamed, their vermilion doors studded with golden nails, their jasper steps and gilded pavilions resplendent with rare trees and precious blossoms.\n\nTwo immortal youths welcomed the Master into the jade hall, where he took his central seat, while the Imperial Lord sat in attendance. The air was warm as spring, and the scenery transcended the mortal realm. Soon, a dozen or so celestial lads presented elixirs of primordial harmony and immortal fruits as offerings. After partaking, as they sat at leisure, the Imperial Lord rose from his seat and asked, “What cave heaven is this?”\n\nThe Master replied, “This was once the former abode of my master, the Imperial Lord of Eastern Florescence—the Lesser Yang Grotto-Heaven.”\n\nThe Imperial Lord bowed twice and inquired, “How many kinds of immortals are there in the cultivation of transcendence, and what merits lead one to such a state?”\n\nThe Master said, “There are fifteen ranks of immortals in the refinement of truth. Let me briefly describe a few.\n\nThose who awaken to the world’s impermanence, where arising and ceasing are fleeting, illusions all empty, and worldly thoughts suddenly stilled—whose original nature shines with perfect clarity—are called *Pure and Numinous Ghost Immortals*.\n\nThose who emulate the celestial cycles of ascent and descent, the subtle ebb and flow of yin and yang, using body and mind as cauldron and furnace, essence and breath as elixir—who empty the five aggregates and still the seven emotions—whose physical form grows light and agile over time, drifting like a cloud, are called *Luminous Earth Immortals*.\n\nThose who extinguish all passions and desires, dissolve attachments and delusions, whose minds become lucid, whose nature is emptiness—who take the Great Ultimate as their furnace and heaven and earth as their cauldron, refining primordial essence, calming primordial qi, and coalescing primordial spirit—where the three primals merge in wondrous union, and the one true body is mysterious—who transcend the semblance of form, rising beyond the unbegun, beyond the ken of ghosts and spirits, whose transformations are boundless—are called *Divine Immortals*.\n\nThose whose spirit and breath fuse in marvelous harmony, whose transformations are unfathomable, whose form dissolves into the formless, whose nature and life abide in jade-like emptiness—whose body is one with the Great Void, where true emptiness is not empty, and the great image is imageless—who roam freely beyond the ultimate, swimming in the primordial, suddenly transcending the natural void to reach the Jade Purity Realm—are called *Celestial Immortals*.”\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, “Are these all encompassed by the Great Dao?”\n\nThe Master replied, “The Great Dao is without form or name, without question or response. Vast beyond measure, yet contained within the infinitesimal, it fills the cosmos and governs the ages. It neither changes nor shifts, neither lives nor dies. It transforms without transforming, is divine without divinity. Subtle, wondrous, serene, and spontaneous—ineffable and beyond description. Strive diligently, my disciple.”\n\nSuddenly, two immortals appeared, clad in golden crowns and rosy robes, jade pendants and cloud-like garments, bearing a jade decree and golden script. They summoned the Celestial Selection Envoy of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Tower, Zhongli of such-and-such, to attend the Jasper Pool Immortal Assembly in the Upper Palace of Penglai. The Master received the decree, whereupon the Perfected One presented a poem:\n\n*“To meet once attained the Dao is rare indeed,*\n*Now you ascend the immortal altar with haste.*\n*At your staff’s tip, spring’s hue in a gourd of wine,*\n*Atop your head, clouds pierce the Five Peaks’ crown.*\n*The sea-turtle drinker goes unrecognized,*\n*The mountain-burning talisman defies ghostly eyes.*\n*When you depart, this frame must wither—*\n*Grant this poor wretch the Elixir of Bone-Transformation!”*\n\nFearing the Master’s swift departure would leave no time for return, the Master smiled and drew from his sleeve a scroll of the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure: Ascending the Mysterious and Dissolving Disasters to Protect Life*, which he entrusted to the Perfected One. He admonished again, “This scripture was transmitted by the Imperial Lord of Eastern Florescence. Within it lies the wondrous subtlety of true emptiness and profound mystery, cutting through all illusions of form, sound, and false appearances. Study it well. I shall return before long. Take care, take care.”\n\nXiangzhang said:\n\"The Valley Spirit unobscured is called *Ling* (Numinous).\nThe fusion of primordial darkness is called *Bao* (Treasure).\nPenetrating the Mysterious Pass to ascend the supreme realm is called *Shengxuan* (Ascending the Mysterious).\nThe blending of heart and breath to preserve the Great Harmony is called *Huming* (Protecting Life).\"\n\nWithin the scripture, it speaks of sentient beings mired in stagnation, deluded by sound and form. From primordial chaos to the ultimate state—knowing emptiness as not-empty, knowing form as not-form—this is called *zhaoliao* (illuminating clarity), the first attainment of the wondrous tone. Recognizing the Dharma of primordial emptiness, one perceives without obstruction. Entering the gate of manifold subtleties, enlightenment arises naturally. Free from the net of doubts, one does not cling to the view of emptiness.\n\nThe above words are concise and apt, merging nature and principle. All three teachings’ essential truths— the great treasury of true emptiness—are fully contained in this scripture. Yet how lamentable that these practitioners recite it daily without ever savoring its true flavor, merely amassing superficial interpretations!\n\nThe Perfected Master first instructed in the methods of ghost immortals, earth immortals, and divine immortals, then bestowed this scripture—how could there not be wondrous subtleties beyond intent? Those who aspire to the Dao must earnestly chew and savor it.\n\n**Chapter Six: Illuminating the Dao in Its Mysterious Embodiment**\nThe True Master of Upright Yang attended the assembly and, after more than ten days, returned to the grotto-heaven. The Imperial Lord joyfully welcomed him with repeated bows. The Master said, \"You have dwelled in this secluded place for days—do you now wish to return?\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord replied, \"My worldly entanglements are already severed, and mundane darkness has dissipated. With my heart set on the Dao, why would I long for my homeland?\"\n\nThe Master nodded in approval and comforted him. The Imperial Lord then asked, \"The soul and spirit dwell in obscurity, and the supreme principle is profoundly subtle—how may one preserve the true?\"\n\nThe Master said, \"The lamp of wisdom shines in darkness; in perfect stillness, the spirit is numinous. When spirit and essence merge, how could one not unite with the true? The golden form and jade substance arise from essence and spirit. The method and image of ascension shall be imparted in oral instructions.\"\n\nAs the Imperial Lord bowed again in gratitude, golden light radiated brilliantly within the grotto, and a harmonious clarity pervaded the air. The Imperial Lord knelt in ninefold reverence and said, \"I have studied various alchemical scriptures and their hexagrams with differing names, yet many doubts remain. I beseech you, Master, in your compassion, to dispel my ignorance and elucidate each in detail.\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"The heart has no boundaries—where do doubts arise? Before heaven and earth took form, before parents were born, even the word *Dao* is but a forced name. What hexagrams or differing names could there be? Since you have doubts, do not hesitate to raise them.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"The alchemical texts speak of cultivating the Golden Elixir—what is the Golden Elixir?\"\n\nThe Master said, \"Gold is a metaphor for firmness; elixir, for roundness. It is your inherent nature—luminous, round, and indestructible.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"Are nature and life one or two?\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"They cannot be called one, nor can they be called two. The single point of numinous clarity is the primordial essence of nature. The single point of primordial *qi* is the ever-regulated life. If nature lacks life, they cannot rely on each other and cannot be at peace. If life lacks nature, they cannot interpenetrate and cannot be firmly consolidated. When the two merge, they become a single true and jadelike purity. Nature and life are both but forced names.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are water and fire?\"\n\nThe Master answered, \"Primordial spirit is fire; primordial *qi* is water. When spirit and *qi* blend, water and fire achieve harmony.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are true yin and true yang?\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"The single point of primordial essence within the body is true yin. The single point of primordial *qi* is true yang. When essence and *qi* fuse intimately, yin and yang merge into a singular, undifferentiated body.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are *kan* (坎) and *li* (离)?\"\n\nThe Master said, \"They are the images of yin-yang and water-fire mentioned earlier. Yang within yin is *kan*; yin within yang is *li*. Extracting the one yang from *kan* and returning the one yin to *li* forms the pure yang of *qian* (乾).\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What is the arising of the one yang?\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"It is the moment when the primordial *qi* within the body stirs. At the extreme of stillness, a single movement arises—this is the birth of the one yang. As the *Daodejing* says, 'Subtle and continuous, its use is never exhausted.' When the time arrives, the spirit knows it. At this moment, the abyss is clear, thoughts cease, and inner illumination naturally governs the ascent and descent of the Three Palaces. Clinging to the four cardinal points of *zi* and *wu* as the time of generation is all delusion. Not knowing the constant and acting recklessly invites misfortune.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What is the fire timing?\"\n\nThe Master answered, \"Wisdom is fire; *qi* is timing. When heart and breath interdepend, subtly and warmly sustained, this is the fire timing of civil refinement. When emotions arise and thoughts stir, with resolute will and forceful return, this is the fire timing of martial vigor.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are the medicinal substances?\"\n\nThe primordial *qi* is the primordial essence!\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are the furnace and cauldron?\"\n\nThe Master answered, \"The body is the jade furnace; the heart is the golden cauldron.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What is the Mysterious Pass?\"\n\nThe Master answered, \"It is the pivot of the most profound and wondrous mechanism, also called the 'mysterious within the mysterious,' the supreme and ultimate barrier. When the primordial spirit congeals within, it is forcibly named the 'Spirit Valley.' When the primordial *qi* rests within, it is forcibly named the 'Mysterious Female.' Metaphorically, it is the mysterious aperture within the body, the valley of emptiness and primal origin. It is the locus of primordial perfection, neither existent nor void. As the *Daodejing* states, 'The valley spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female'—this is precisely that wondrous principle.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are the Green Dragon and White Tiger?\"\n\nThe Master answered, \"Nature pertains to wood, hence it is metaphorically called the Green Dragon. Emotion pertains to metal, hence it is metaphorically called the White Tiger. Metal can overcome wood, so emotion often harms nature. If one can truly gather emotion back into nature, then metal and wood will be without conflict and become one, and naturally the dragon and tiger will be subdued.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are the Tortoise and Snake?\"\n\nThe Master answered, \"They are the symbolic representations of water and fire, yin and yang, as previously described.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are lead and mercury?\"\n\nThe Master answered, \"They are the heart and *qi*. The heart is like mercury, difficult to subdue; if one can truly still the *qi* and nurture the heart, then the heart will die, and nature will become perfectly luminous. If one can empty the heart and cultivate vastness, then the *qi* will rest, and the life-force will no longer leak. Lead can control mercury, so the sages borrowed these two substances as metaphors to teach people the ease of cultivating truth. As for the eight trigrams and five phases, all are metaphors employed to return to the origin. The four images and three powers are all forced names to convey the Dao. If you can still the heart and rest the *qi*, rest the *qi* and congeal the spirit, so that *qi* and spirit merge as one, heart and nature share a single source, and a body exists beyond the body—then the corporeal form becomes the Jade Void. All these many discussions are but clouds obscuring the vast sky, dust on the mirror, or wind upon the water. You must suddenly awaken and vigorously practice, and all will naturally unfold.\"\n\nThe Perfected One bowed in gratitude.\n\nXiangzhang said: \"This dialogue between master and ancestor has been secretly transmitted by successive sagely teachers, heart-to-heart as a hidden seal, bestowed only upon virtuous and aspiring scholars—with strict injunctions never to lightly reveal it to ordinary people. I, Fengsheng, count myself most fortunate to have encountered it. As I silently revered and savored its heart-transmission, I burned incense and performed the nine prostrations, offering gratitude in the emptiness of space. Every word is golden scripture, every character a pearl of jade—these are the most wondrous and precise teachings of cultivating truth. Herein lie the profound mysteries of illuminating the heart and nurturing nature, the marvelous functions of wisdom-life and true emptiness. All are contained within.\n\nI, the dull one, have often sighed in private at the worldly transmissions of *Lingbao Bifa* and *Zhong-Lü Chuandao Ji*, which are riddled with errors and distortions, composed by those who seek fame and novelty. Some attribute them to Shi Jianwu, though it remains uncertain. Others have cobbled together spurious texts, compiling records to validate principles and events, claiming them as the root of Dao transmission—truly the croaking of well-frogs. They mistake thieves for brothers, cast stones as earth, and lead the blind with blindness, displaying shamelessness beyond measure. I dare not speak further, for there are other treasures to be revealed.\"\n\n**Seventh Transformation: The Secret Seal of the Sword**\n\nDuring a tranquil sitting, the Perfected One of True Yang addressed the Imperial Lord of Pure Yang: \"To embody the Dao in cultivation relies entirely on the steadfast power of wisdom. To enter the wondrous and fathom the profound, one must first possess a resolute and unyielding will. Thus, from ultimate end to primal beginning, even heaven and earth cannot alter it. In its great function and subtle mechanism, even ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it. Therefore, the sages wield the treasure sword, inverting the pivot to traverse the celestial sphere, relying on its unyielding edge to directly subdue demons and monsters—hence the metaphor of the sword technique.\n\nThis sword is forged from the purest essence of the primordial extreme, blended with the primordial *qi* of pre-heaven, tempered in the furnace and scabbard of heaven and earth, and wrought with the pincers and hammer of the White Origin. Refined by the fire of wisdom and sharpened by the spring of spirit, it takes the Supreme Ultimate as its ring, firmness-within-softness as its hilt, keen sharpness as its blade, and purity as its scabbard. Radiant in empty whiteness, it is utterly pure, firm, and unyielding. It moves with the mechanism of creation and transformation, wielding the mandate of benevolence and awe. Raised, it transcends past and present; pressed, it knows no before or after. The gods and ghosts of the Six Heavens submit, the demons and monsters of the Three Realms beg for mercy. It shatters the hindrances of affliction, severs the bonds of greed and desire. It slays the seven emotions, executes the six thieves, severs wrath, and annihilates delusion and perversity. When matters arise, they are resolved at the blade’s edge. Concealed within the body, it can transcend life and death, embodying the primordial. Wielded in governance, it can pacify the nation and purify the world. Its brilliance and efficacy are vast, perfectly blending firmness and softness. At its sight, the treacherous grow cold with fear; at its name, heretics shatter with dread.\n\nYou must advance with diligence, perfecting the horizontal and vertical, so that the Great Void stands awe-inspiring.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord received this sword technique with utmost reverence, bowing in gratitude. Concealing its radiance and obscuring its edge, he secretly descended upon Huafeng Peak, naming it: *The Pre-Heavenly Reclusive Spirit Sword*.\n\nWhen the disciples of the teaching obtained this sword treatise, they savored and pondered it with boundless joy, composing the *Ode to the Wisdom Sword*:\n\n*In the Purple Ultimate Grotto, the sword’s secret is transmitted,*\n*Neither yin nor yang, nor forged of iron.*\n*The primordial qi of pre-heaven warms and melts, surging forth,*\n*Once cast, it can slay demonic afflictions.*\n\n*Refined by warmth, tempered and polished,*\n*Its edge surpasses Zhanlu and Moye, even Great E.*\n*Grasped in hand, dragons and tigers submit;*\n*Sheathed, the spirit and qi harmonize.*\n\n*It slays the Three Corpses, executes the Five Thieves,*\n*Annihilates the seven emotions and six desires.*\n*Greed, hatred, and delusion vanish entirely,*\n*Confused and scattered demonic hosts are utterly destroyed.*\n\n*It can give life, it can kill,*\n*Its authority over life and death flashes like lightning.*\n*When matters arise, they are resolved at the blade’s edge;*\n*When worries and doubts surge, they are quelled by its tip.*\n\n*Our Ancestor Lü, having obtained this sword,*\n*Opened and established heaven and earth as one expanse.*\n*Cutting off life and death, his body became adamantine,*\n*Manifesting or concealing, he transformed without fixed form.*\n\n*He saved the dying, revived the skeletal,*\n*How could a divine immortal take lives wantonly?*\n*Wild foxes craftily deceive the foolish and vulgar,*\n*Yet how could the phoenix of cinnabar resent the black hawk’s startlement?*\n\n*It subdues heavenly demons, tames heretics,*\n*Sweeping away ten thousand dharmas and a thousand gates with a single stroke.*\n*Its worth is priceless in pacifying the world,*\n*A treasure of boundless virtue, purifying the cosmos.*\n\n*This treasure sword ever accompanies the body,*\n*Concealed in use, revealed in benevolence, its edge absolute.*\n*Like flawless jade, its brilliance gleams,*\n*Clear as crystal, without a speck of dust.*\n\n*Within this treasure sword, the void abides,*\n*Personally bestowed by the Supreme upon the hand of Donghua.*\n*Secretly transmitted by the myriad ancestors and immortals,*\n*Obtained, its wisdom shines like the stars.*\n\n*Brandished like golden lightning, pressed like a jade dragon,*\n*It moves freely, manifesting the six penetrations.*\n*Its snow-bright blade glows within the primordial extreme,*\n*Its frost-sharp edge gleams in the Great Void.*\n\n*It pacifies the world, orders the nation,*\n*With a casual lift, the world is cleansed and solemn.*\n*The loyal, worthy, and sagely all submit,*\n*While the treacherous, rebellious, and perverse are all cut down.*\n\n*The buddhas, ancestors, and host of immortals,*\n*Without this sword, the Dao cannot be accomplished.*\n*It excises human desire to fulfill heavenly principle,*\n*Sweeping away the winds and clouds to ascend the Great Clarity.\"*\n\nHere ends the second scroll of *The Wondrous Records of the Divine Transformations of the Imperial Lord of Pure Yang*.\n\nHere begins the third scroll of *The Wondrous Records of the Divine Transformations of the Imperial Lord of Pure Yang*.\n\nHere begins the compilation of poetic imagery for the Gate of Mystery, corrected and arranged by Miao Shanshi.\n\n**The Eighth Transformation: Reclusion at Huafeng**\n\nAfter Master Zhengyang transmitted the oral instructions to the Imperial Lord, expounded the *Method of the Wisdom Sword* to dispel all doubts, he declared: *\"The feathered transcendents of the Ten Isles shall ascend to the Jade Capital—my audience with the Primordial has its appointed time. You may find it difficult to remain here long; go instead to the Feathered Valley of Huafeng to cultivate and await the hour. When the moment is ripe, you too shall respond to conditions and benefit beings. When your merit is complete and your work fulfilled, we shall meet again.\"*\n\nThereupon, at the mouth of the grotto, he inscribed these lines:\n*The spring qi fills the void, petals dripping dew,*\n*The morning sun strikes the sea as clouds return to the peaks.*\n\nHe further admonished: *\"After I depart, dwell well among mortals. When your merit and virtue are perfected, you too shall ascend to the Jade Void as I have.\"*\n\nThe Imperial Lord bowed twice and replied: *\"This disciple’s aspiration differs from yours, Master. I must first deliver all sentient beings in the world—only then will my ascent not be too late.\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"Strive on, young one. Though your heart is truly compassionate, the karmic conditions of beings are light, while their deeds are heavy. Of those you deliver henceforth, five hundred disciples shall follow, but only three to five shall inherit my Dao lineage. Until we meet again by chance, cherish and treasure this transmission.\"*\n\nWith these words, he departed with the two immortals, Shi Taiyu and Zheng Siyuan, riding upon a cloud-borne golden canopy and jade scepter, their feathered banners and immortal music ascending gently into the distance. The Imperial Lord, overcome with longing, then retreated to the Feathered Valley of Huafeng, where amid verdant forests and limpid springs, he herded and cultivated for over forty years, perfecting the fruit of the Dao.\n\nThus, Master Yong wrote in his stele inscription: *\"For over forty years, he dwelt in seclusion in the Feathered Valley of Huayin.\"* The *Daoist Canon*’s *Elixir Instructions of the Azure Lad Emperor* records that in the Tang dynasty, the presented scholar Lü Dongbin was enticed by Zhongli Quan with the mysteries of the Dao and received the method of refining the golden elixir to transmute form. Later, residing on Huafeng of Zhongnan, he completed his cultivation, his form and spirit both wondrous, his divine transformations unfathomable. Li Qi, who served as a gentleman of the Imperial Archives during the Xiangfu era, once witnessed Lü Dongbin in Guanzhong wielding the *Divine Sword Method*; though over a hundred years old, his countenance was that of an infant, and his steps swift as flight. Thereafter, he appeared and vanished at will, wandering through Hunan, Hubei, E’zhou, and Mount Lu, his whereabouts unknown even to himself, his movements beyond the ken of gods and spirits.\n\nThe *Illustrated Guide to Cultivating the Mysterious* records that he passed through Jiangzhou, ascended Yellow Crane Tower in Wuchang, and on the twentieth day of the fifth month at noon, transformed into a three-tiered crimson tower and ascended. He left behind this poem:\n*The magic fungus has no seed nor root,*\n*Yet knows to drink and eat, reviving the soul.*\n*So long as mist and rosy clouds sustain the years,*\n*Let the crow and hare race through the cosmos.*\n*The infant clings only to the mother in yang,*\n*The old woman must face the honored one atop the head.*\n*With virtue unwavering through a thousand ages,*\n*No tomb shall mark this lineage for descendants.*\n\nThe assembled stanzas declare: *\"The divine transformations of the sagely immortal defy constancy in dwelling; his traces are untraceable, hence his concealments and manifestations elude all knowledge. In some regions, temples, abbeys, and official monasteries stand, and mountains and rivers bear traces of his manifestations. Yet those who would erect steles and records often fail to find the right person. Moreover, some claim his name without substance, their shallow knowledge and partial glimpses failing to distinguish truth from falsehood. Others falsely attribute deeds to the Imperial Lord to lend credence to their tales—such as *The Pavilion Overlooking the River*, which claims he concealed his name, fearing recognition. How could one who transforms appearance and form beyond measure ever proclaim his own identity? Such errors propagate, and from these examples, the foolish may infer the rest. Thus, I have dared, though unworthy, to consult histories, classics, and collections, verifying facts to arrange and compile this record. May those who embody the Dao’s aspiration find their doubts resolved hereafter.\"*\n\nHis ascent upon the three-tiered crimson tower was but another divine transformation. Alas, the era was not recorded—only the poem remains.\n\n**The Ninth Transformation: Receiving the Luminous Seal**\n\nThe Imperial Lord of Pure Yang held his aspirations lofty, refusing service to kings and marquises. Transcending the mundane, he soared beyond the material world. Thus, none in the realm dared claim him as subject, nor could princes befriend him. After parting from his master, he concealed himself in the Feathered Valley of Huafeng for over forty years. Only in the late Tang did people come to know of him. He later revealed himself to Li Qi, who lived to one hundred and fifty before passing. Lü delivered over a hundred immortals, his appearances and names ever-changing.\n\nDuring the Five Dynasties period, he again concealed himself on Mount Hua, styling himself the *Palace of Primordial Harmony*, donning a hempen robe—hence the name *Hemp-Robed Daoist*. He expounded the principles of the *Book of Changes* and the *Triplex Unity* to enlighten Master Chen Xiyi, as well as Liu Xuanying, the Duke of Yan—later the *Imperial Lord of the Sea Toad*—both of whom became his disciples. The *Imperial Lord of the Sea Toad* first encountered Master Zhengyang, who revealed the peril of piled eggs, prompting his sudden awakening to the Dao. Later, he concealed himself on Mount Hua to cultivate and verify the truth.\n\nThe Imperial Lord of Pure Yang composed the *Heart of the Changes* and transmitted it to Master Xiyi—this is the *Heart of the Changes of the Hemp-Robed Master* now circulating in the world. He also composed three scrolls of *Secret Instructions of the Immortal Lineage* and transmitted them to Liu, the *Imperial Lord of the Sea Toad*. Today, in the Gate of Mystery, the transmission of the Dao flows heart to heart, secretly imparted and received, preserved in the *Precious Record of the Golden Lotus*.\n\nAt the beginning of the Song dynasty, he departed Mount Hua and left this poem for Master Xiyi:\n*A path through azure skies sees few travelers;*\n*Lament not the rise and fall of worldly affairs.*\n*Though the golden roster bears no surname,*\n*The Jade Capital yet cherishes an immortal’s name.*\n*Clouds return to the vast sea, dragons of a thousand years;*\n*Snow fills the endless sky, a crane’s lone cry.*\n\nLater, moved by gratitude, he added:\n*I thank the enlightened sage-kings of this luminous dynasty,*\n*Who repeatedly issued vermilion edicts to summon the Master.*\n\nIndeed, the founding emperors Taizu and Taizong thrice issued summons to him. Later, he returned to Huafeng, only to find Master Xiyi already ascended. He then left this poem:\n*The heavenly net is vast, yet how could it be loose?*\n*For you, I hasten to the precincts of Mount Hua.*\n*After the cold stars fade, a waning moon remains;*\n*As spring snow arrives, I inquire of the Great Void.*\n*Three Grotto Realized Ones return to the Purple Palace;*\n*A thousand-year-old crane transforms into a verdant wutong.*\n*Since parting from you, Master,*\n*Few true men walk the four quarters.*\n\nThe *Imagery and Stanzas* record: *\"The Realized One transmitted the mysteries of the *Changes* and the *Heart of the Changes* to Master Xiyi, who later transmitted them to Shenguang. Shenguang transmitted them to Mu Xiu, Mu Xiu to Zhou Lianxi, Zhou to the two Chengs, and the Chengs to Wen and Sima Guang.\"*\n\nSea Toad Emperor received the *Changes* and elucidated the Dao of immortality, later transmitting it southward to Zhang Ziyang. Zhang composed the *Triplex Unity of the Zhou Changes*. He passed it to Shi Taizhi, and after three transmissions it reached Zhuge Yuchan, then two more transmissions brought it to Master Li Yuansu of Qing’an. To the north, he transmitted it to Emperor Chongyang Wang, who used the mysteries of the *Changes* and the River Chart and Luo Writ to divide the teachings into the Ten Transformations of Li and the Seven Perfected of Danyang. Later, golden lotuses bloomed by the myriad, jade trees flourished by the thousand, and successors never lacked. All traced their lineage to the residual grace of Emperor Chunyang.\n\nDuring the Five Dynasties, Li Shouzheng rebelled and occupied Hezhong Prefecture. Emperor Taizu of Zhou personally led the campaign, accompanied by Emperor Taizu of Song and Emperor Shizong of Zhou, to besiege the city. Master Clad-in-Hemp and King Zhao Han observed from afar, saying, “How could Minister Li endure long?” King Han asked why. The master replied, “Beyond the city walls, three imperial qi arise.” Soon after, the city fell.\n\nAnother account: Qian Ruoshui, Duke Wenxi, possessed a spirit of refined purity. Master Xiyi deemed him fit to study immortality, but upon closer inspection, he asked the Perfected One to assess him. The master said, “He lacks the bone of immortality—he may only become a noble minister.” Both prophecies came to pass, and thus they were recorded.\n\n**The Tenth Transformation: Divine Response to Emperors**\nIn the second year of Jianlong during the reign of Emperor Shenwu of Song, the emperor sat in repose at the Dragon Pavilion in the imperial gardens when he suddenly saw a feather-clad immortal approaching from the southeast. Startled, the emperor rose to greet him, bowing and inviting him to sit. He asked the immortal whence he came. The reply: “From Mount Penglai.” When asked his name, the Immortal Lord traced two circles in the air and said, “Your Majesty is Zhu Ling—does the Celestial Emperor still recall?” The emperor fell silent. The Immortal Lord continued, “You shall flourish the realm with the virtue of fire. The realm will be pacified without toil—let this ease your sagely concerns. Refrain from slaughter, govern with non-action and purity, and all will endure.” After some time, the emperor could only nod in assent. The rest of their discourse remained secret.\n\nThe emperor ordered attendants to bring wine and fruit, but the Immortal Lord declined. The emperor hastily removed his jade belt and cinnabar robe to bestow upon him. The Immortal Lord smiled, then vanished into the void. The emperor realized: “It was Lord Lü.” He commanded his likeness be painted and enshrined in the Hall of Supreme Purity. Chen Jingyuan of the Left Street Daoist Registry transmitted his image to the world. Later, what Teng Zijin witnessed was nearly identical.\n\n**Poetic Imagery:**\nFive Dynasties rose and fell in fifty years,\nHeaven raised a hero to settle mountains and streams.\nThe Perfected One respectfully admonished with purity,\nThe sagely lord truly embraced nature’s decree.\nJade belt and cinnabar robe—imperial splendor,\nBlue kerchief and crane cloak—Daoist mystery.\nWith a fleeting smile, whither did he return?\nTurning back, clouds soared beyond the heavens.\n\n**The Eleventh Transformation: Seeking Tea at the Stone Shop**\nAt the end of Later Zhou, in Bianjing, a family named Shi ran a tea shop. Their daughter, still young, served tea with grace. The Emperor Lord disguised himself as a beggar, visiting daily to sit in the honored seat and demand tea. His clothes were tattered, his flesh filthy with grime—scarcely approachable. The girl harbored no disgust, instead serving him the finest tea. Her parents, enraged, beat her, yet she treated the Emperor Lord even better.\n\nAfter a month, the Emperor Lord asked, “Could you drink the dregs of my tea?” The girl, finding it too foul to swallow, poured it onto the ground. Suddenly, an extraordinary fragrance arose. She hastily licked it, and her spirit felt refreshed. The Emperor Lord said, “I am Master Lü, no beggar. I regret you did not finish my leavings. Yet do you wish for wealth, nobility, or longevity?” The girl replied, “I am but a humble girl—what do I know of nobility? Wealth and longevity would suffice.”\n\nThe Emperor Lord departed and never returned. Later, the girl married a battalion commander. Eventually, she became the wet nurse to a grandson of King Wu of Wu, who happened to be the uncle of Empress Xuanren Shenglie. She received the fief of Yangmu and lived to one hundred thirty-five before passing.\n\n**Poetic Imagery:**\nLu Tong’s seven bowls—why praise them so?\nA gauze hat and tattered cloak—what’s there to boast?\nMy ancestor’s dragon’s breath now unfurls,\nSuddenly, golden blossoms sprout across the earth.\n\nThe Shijia girl, nurtured halfway through her life, gained wealth, nobility, peace, and robust health in old age.\nHad Zhao Zhou tasted this flavor, he would have strolled casually into the clouds of nuptial mist.\n\n**The Twelfth Transformation: The Salvation of the Old Pine Spirit**\nBeneath White Crane Mountain in Baling County, Yuezhou, two deep pools concealed colossal pythons. Above the pools stood an ancient tree, its branches and trunk withered, overgrown with creeping vines.\n\nAs the Emperor Lord passed by, a figure descended from the treetop and bowed, saying, “I am the spirit of this pine. Fortunate to meet you, Master, I beg for deliverance.”\n\nThe Emperor Lord replied, “You are a demonic sprite—how could I speak to you of the Dao? Yet have you ever accrued hidden virtue?”\n\nThe spirit answered, “The two pythons in the pools have repeatedly harmed people. I, Shi Bailong, have often transformed into a man standing in the water to warn people away, saving hundreds of lives.”\n\nThe pythons emerged, and the Emperor Lord transformed them into swords, sinking them into the spring.\n\n**Poem by the Emperor Lord:**\nAlone I walk, alone I sit,\nIn this world, no one knows me.\nOnly the old tree spirit of Southern Mountain\nClearly recognizes a transcendent passing by.\n\nToday, before the Baling Hermitage, one withered old trunk stands dead, while a single branch beside it thrives—such is the power of divine elixir. The tree is called the \"Young Pine.\" Another massive stone, ink-black in appearance, remains where the Emperor Lord transformed it.\n\n**Poem:**\nA true immortal moves and rests with the times,\nHis spirit concealed—who sees me?\nKnowing the old tree saved many lives,\nHe leisurely passed by the pool.\nA single grain of the great elixir, wielded with a wave,\nShattered two giant pythons like wind.\nBeneath Lü’s Pavilion, traces endure,\nHis mighty virtue unmarred through the ages.\n\n**The Thirteenth Transformation: The Salvation of Guo Xian**\nGuo Shang’ao was the reborn form of the old tree spirit. One day, the Emperor Lord disguised himself as a beggar, his face filthy, his robes tattered, his sores oozing. Daily, he came to sip tea without paying a single coin. Those who sought tea covered their noses and left; for months, no one served him.\n\nGuo Yuan grew displeased but prepared finer tea to offer him. The Emperor Lord said, “You are teachable. I am Lü Gong. Your past life was as the old tree spirit—do you recall?”\n\nGuo was suddenly awakened, as if from a dream, and said, “Fortunate to meet you, Master, I beg you to teach me the Dao.”\n\nThe Emperor Lord replied, “If you wish to learn the Dao, fear not life and death. You must receive this sword.” Guo assented. The Emperor Lord raised his sword toward Guo’s head; Guo cried out, and the Emperor Lord vanished in an instant.\n\nDisheartened, Guo wandered thereafter as a cloud-water monk. One day, he unexpectedly encountered the Emperor Lord and attained the Dao.\n\nLater, Magistrate Zhao of Cizhou honored him. Guo said to Magistrate Zhao, “Tomorrow at noon, I shall depart. Prepare a small coffin with an opening at the head, and thread a bamboo pole through it.”\n\nZhao agreed. The next day at noon, Guo sat and passed away. Zhao followed his instructions, burying him on the riverbank, piercing the opening with a bamboo pole, and piling stones to protect it. When autumn rains swelled the river, Zhao exhumed the coffin—only tattered cotton and no corpse remained.\n\n**Poem:**\nThe tree spirit’s past life accrued hidden merit,\nReborn as a man, he hid in the marketplace.\nA single sword cut through the dust of this life,\nYears of Dharma rain connected past and present.\nWorldly passions extinguished, his heart boundless,\nHis celestial nature radiant, his body vast as the void.\nWhy manifest again in a coffin, grotesque and crude?\nHe left traces to inspire his lineage.\n\n**The Fourteenth Transformation: The Audience with Zhong Ruoweng**\nZhong Chuan, Military Commissioner of Pingdong, was called Ruoweng. The Emperor Lord, wearing a headscarf and white robe, sought an audience with him, leading a young cowherd who held a yellow calf in the courtyard.\n\nRuoweng marveled at his profound and expansive bearing, his graceful demeanor. Pointing to the cowherd, he said, “This Daoist is skilled in poetry—can he compose a verse on this scene?”\n\nThe Emperor Lord replied, “No need for my words—this boy can do it himself.” The cowherd wrote in large characters:\n*Grass carpets the wilds for six or seven li,\nA flute plays three or four notes in the evening breeze.\nReturning well-fed at dusk,\nHe sleeps under the moon, straw cloak still on.*\n\nAfter parting, people saw him carrying two large jars, singing loudly as he left the city. Someone reported to Ruoweng, “The jars had two mouths—this was Lü Gong!”\n\nRuoweng hastily pursued him but saw him no more. Today, those who preserve his calligraphy find it imbued with the bearing of soaring luan and phoenix—truly, no ordinary man could achieve such.\n\n**Poetic Reflection:**\n*The Master as cowherd had long made his name known,\nHis long song and twin jars stirred echoes profound.\nRuoweng’s pursuit left him only with grief,\nFor he failed to grasp the lightness of the Dao’s true leaf.*\n\n**The Fifteenth Transformation: Jing Ti Ding**\nMinister Ding, styled Weigong, hailed from Poyang. When the Emperor Lord visited him, he declared, “I am the grandson of Lü Wei of the Tang.” In appearance, he closely resembled Li Deyu, and his future path would mirror his as well. Weigong, however, took offense at the mention of his taboo name, showing neither favor nor respect. True to the prophecy, he was later disgraced and exiled beyond the seas—indeed, his fate echoed that of Zanyang. **Poetic Reflection:**\n*Weigong’s talents shone with cunning art,\nYet his heart was skewed, his nature obstinate.\nBlind to the warning of Li Deyu’s shade,\nHe now cowers, shamed before Minister Kou’s gaze.*\n\n**The Sixteenth Transformation: Chancellor Zhang**\nIn his early years, Chancellor Zhang Ji resided at home when the Emperor Lord visited him. Requesting brush and paper, the Emperor Lord wrote in the *bafen* script, inscribing a poem that subtly hinted at his future rise to the highest councils. The closing lines read:\n*Success shall come in the year of the shattered melon.*\nLater, Zhang did ascend to the grand council, dying at the age of sixty-four. The common folk took “shattered melon” to mean sixty-four (eight times eight), for it was his destined omen. **Poetic Reflection:**\n*The immortal’s verse foretold the shattered year,\nA fleeting spring, its firmness soon to disappear.\nAlas, Zhang grasped not the warning’s weight,\nAt sixty-four, he plunged into the yellow gate.*\n\n**The Seventeenth Transformation: Duke Cao of the State**\nDuke Cao of the State was the son of Chancellor Cao Bin and the younger brother of Empress Cao. His features were refined, his hair bound with a clasp, his bearing elegant and quick-witted. By nature, he was serene and gentle, his innate goodness pure and untainted.\n\nDuke Cao of the State scorned wealth and honor, yearning instead for purity and emptiness. By the age of twelve or thirteen, he had mastered the Three Teachings and their scriptures at a single glance. From childhood, he frequented the imperial palace, where the emperor and empress alike cherished and revered him. Whenever the emperor conversed with him, he spoke only of stillness, spontaneity, and the primal qi as the foundation of governance. The emperor, greatly pleased, once bestowed upon him a yellow robe with red sashes, but Cao merely bowed in gratitude and declined. One day, he took leave of the emperor and empress. When asked where he was bound, he replied, \"A Daoist’s home is wherever the mind wanders; his heart roams the four seas.\" The emperor and empress repeatedly urged him to stay, offering saddled horses and attendants, but he refused all. The emperor then presented him with a golden tablet, inscribed: *Wherever the Duke of the State goes, it is as if We Ourselves are present.* Soon after, he vanished for days at a time, living only by begging with a basket and exchanging alms for sustenance.\n\nOnce, at a Yellow River ferry crossing, the boatman demanded passage money. Cao said, \"I am a Daoist; I have no coin.\" The boatman cursed and drove him away, so Cao drew the golden tablet from his robe to cover the fare. When the passengers saw the imperial inscription, they cried, \"Long live the Emperor!\" The boatman, terrified, prostrated himself. Then, an emaciated Daoist seated in the boat shouted, \"You have left the world—how dare you rely on power to intimidate others?\" Cao bowed deeply and replied, \"Disciple, disciple—how could I presume such a thing?\" The Daoist asked, \"Can you cast it into the water?\" Without hesitation, Cao hurled the tablet into the depths. The crowd gasped and bowed in awe. The Daoist called Cao ashore, saying, \"Come with me.\" Cao agreed, and they disembarked together.\n\nAfter walking several li, they rested beneath a great tree. The Daoist asked, \"Have you ever met Dongbin?\" Cao replied, \"This humble one is but a mortal—how could I know an immortal?\" The Daoist sighed and said, \"I am he, and I have come specifically to guide you.\" Cao bowed again, and they journeyed on. Dongbin transmitted to him the wondrous oral formulas of the Dao, enabling him to cultivate and attain the fruit of immortality. His *Collected Writings of the Immortal* are said to have been passed down to the world.\n\n**Poetic Reflection:**\n*Beyond worldly things, his nature pure and true,\nHis spirit soared, his qi untainted, bright.\nWith eyes that spanned the seas, desire he overthrew,\nHis heart embraced the Three Powers, free of dust’s blight.\nThe golden tablet bestowed—he smiled but once,\nHis master’s secret transmission brought eternal spring.\nFrom green-clad father’s virtue, Tang’s grace did spring,\nOne empress, two immortals—such was heaven’s design.*\n\n**The Eighteenth Transformation: Immortal Lady Cao**\nAccording to *The Transmission of Immortal Lady Cao*, when Emperor Pure Yang was traveling through an ancient temple in Henan, a monk who had entered nirvana appeared faintly before him in the dead of night and bowed. The Emperor questioned him, and the monk replied, \"I was once the abbot of this temple, renowned for my swift and incisive responses in debate.\" The Emperor said, \"Alas, you are but a yin spirit now.\" The monk sighed and asked, \"Why do you say so?\" The Emperor replied, \"I, Pure Yang, respond to circumstances with effortless adaptability—all can see this. How could you compare?\" The monk, doubtful, pressed further. The Emperor said, \"If you do not believe me, tonight a certain household will hold a vegetarian feast. Let us both attend—what say you?\" The monk agreed, and they proceeded to the feast. The host welcomed them and seated them, soon serving a portion of the meal. The Emperor said, \"There are two of us—bring another portion.\" The host complied, and after the Emperor finished eating and rose to express his thanks, the monk had only inhaled the steam. The host asked, \"Sir, I prepared two portions as you instructed—where is the other guest?\" The Emperor feigned ignorance: \"I know not what became of him; he never arrived.\" They departed, and the monk, suddenly enlightened, bowed again and begged for instruction. The Emperor said, \"To achieve the fusion of nature and life, the perfection of form and spirit, one must refine the primal qi inherited from one’s parents. You must return to the human realm for a time.\" The monk said, \"I fear I will lose my way again.\" The Emperor replied, \"I will guide you myself.\" He then directed the monk to be reborn, and the monk’s thoughts instantly entered the capital, where he merged with Empress Cao’s womb and was conceived as a girl.\n\nFrom afar, the Emperor foresaw that she would struggle to escape the bonds of wealth and nobility, so he shrouded her form in darkness and ugliness. On the third day after her birth, the empress, fearing the emperor’s displeasure, sent her to be raised by her maternal grandmother. As she grew, her appearance remained homely, and she took up the hairpin and sash of a Daoist nun. Later, the Emperor Pure Yang came to awaken her, and Immortal Lady Cao instantly attained enlightenment. She burned incense, bowed, and sought the wondrous teachings of the Dao. The Emperor transmitted to her the secret mysteries of the Mysterious Pass, enabling her to cultivate and perfect both nature and life. Thereafter, her brush flowed effortlessly into prose and verse, and her recorded sayings and poems circulate in the world to this day.\n\n**Poetic Reflection:**\n*Illuminating the mind, perceiving nature—her learning was whole,\nYet she grasped nothing, for all was empty, free.\nA hundred years, ten thousand transformations—already void,\nWhere could that single spark of spirit find its home?\nNature and life merged, her body vast as space,\nForm and spirit fused, she soared beyond the heavens’ gate.\nHad Immortal Lady not met her true teacher,\nHow could she have realized true emptiness and roamed the azure skies?*\n\n**The Nineteenth Transformation: Immortal Lady He**\nImmortal Lady He was a Daoist maiden from Lingling. At thirteen, she followed her companions into the mountains to gather medicinal herbs and tea. Suddenly, she lost her way and wandered alone, unable to find the path home. At the foot of a mountain peak, she saw a man with a long beard and piercing eyes, wearing a tall hat and a green robe—it was Emperor Pure Yang. Immortal Lady He hurriedly prostrated herself before him. The Emperor produced a peach and said, \"You are young and fond of fruit—eat this entirely, and one day you will ascend to the heavens. If not, you will remain earthbound.\" She managed to eat half, and the bearded man pointed out the way home. When she returned, she believed only a day had passed, but in truth, a month had gone by. From then on, she neither hungered nor fell ill, and she gained profound insight into the fortunes and misfortunes of others. Later, she departed through *shi jie*.\n\nThe Emperor once told Immortal Lady He, \"I once wandered through the Huayin market selling medicine. I placed a single elixir among ten thousand pills, and when seekers came, I would reach into the gourd and draw one out at random to observe their karmic affinity.\"\n\n*Records of the Wondrous Transformations of Emperor Pure Yang, Volume Three—End*\n*Records of the Wondrous Transformations of Emperor Pure Yang, Volume Four*\n\n**The Orthodox Daoist Lineage: Miaoshan’s Collated Poems and Visions**\n\n**Twenty-Fifth Transformation: Journey to Jin’e Temple**\nWhen the Emperor arrived at Jin’e Temple in Siming, he found the abbot’s quarters desolate. Presently, a young novice emerged, and the Emperor asked, “Why so empty here?”\nThe novice replied, “Do not say it is empty—even the void cannot contain it.”\nPleased with his answer, the Emperor inscribed a poem on the wall:\n*Jin’e’s gate stands open, unlocked,*\n*Yet a barefoot immortal boy appears.*\n*I ask why the abbot’s hall is so desolate—*\n*He answers, “Even the void cannot contain it.”*\nHearing this, the Emperor smiled with delight, thinking, *How could the master here be an ordinary man?*\n*I came to pay my respects but could not meet him;*\n*My parched heart burns with dust-laden longing.*\n*As I depart, the waves stretch boundless,*\n*The path leads to Penglai, its mountains veiled in mist.*\n*My yearning ascends with my elder brother on Stone Tower,*\n*Where snow clears over the sea and a thousand peaks dawn.*\n\n**Poetic Vision:**\n*The cavern’s gate opens and shuts without lock or key,*\n*Emerging and returning—why move the feet?*\n*Forgetting both motion and stillness, unbound by all,*\n*The body’s samādhi is wholly unattached.*\n*No praise, no anger, no joy or delight,*\n*No deceit, no delusion—one with all beings.*\n*The celestial nature is pure and solemn, without the slightest blemish;*\n*The sacred realm is empty and tranquil, free of even a speck of dust.*\n*The boundless bitter sea stretches endlessly vast,*\n*Finite time fades into dark obscurity.*\n*Stone Tower shatters as the snow begins to clear—*\n*How many dawns remain in this quiet, solitary light?*\n\n**Twenty-Sixth Transformation**\n**Twenty-Seventh Transformation**\n**Twenty-Eighth Transformation**\n**Twenty-Ninth Transformation**\n**Thirtieth Transformation**\n**Thirty-First Transformation**\n**Thirty-Second Transformation**\n**Thirty-Third Transformation**\n*(The above entries were originally missing.)*\n\n**Thirty-Fourth Transformation: The Daoist Seal of Kangjie**\nMaster Kangjie, Shao Yong, styled Yaofu, was once seated in meditation when suddenly an extraordinary fragrance filled the room, and his mind became luminously clear. He cast a divination and obtained the *dui* trigram, representing the mouth. Doubled, it formed two mouths, and he said, “Master Lü has arrived.”\nHe hastily arranged his desk and set up a spirit tablet for the Perfected Lord Pure Yang, waiting respectfully. After some time, his servant announced a Daoist at the gate seeking an audience. Yong hurried out to bow and welcome him into the hall. The Perfected One sat in the place of honor and overturned the tablet, asking, “How did you know I was coming?”\nYong truthfully recounted the earlier signs. The Perfected One said, “Since you knew I was coming, you must also know where I am going. Where am I bound now?”\nYong, at a loss, could not answer. He bowed again and offered wine and fruit, earnestly entreating instruction. The Perfected One said, “Just now, when my thought stirred, you knew it. When I am quiescent, you are bewildered and at a loss.”\nYong suddenly awakened and bowed again. The Perfected One stopped him, saying, “What insight have you gained that you thank me?”\nYong replied, *“Before a single thought arises, even spirits and gods cannot know it. If not by me, then by whom?”*\nThe Perfected One said, “This is the principle of inherent nature, but the wisdom of true emptiness and the life of the spirit remain ungrasped.”\nYong bowed again and knelt thrice, saying, “I beg you to enlighten my dullness.”\nThe Perfected One said, “Mencius spoke of nurturing the vast and unyielding with integrity, calling it ‘hard to explain.’ It is not that it is hard to explain, but that one has not found the right person. Your virtue has long been profound, and you have accumulated much hidden merit. That is why I have come to guide you. You have just glimpsed the edge of the nature of reality—how could I bear not to transmit it to you? Yet though your nature is clear and bright, your karmic burdens remain unexhausted.”\nYong bowed repeatedly, entreating again and again, until the Perfected One imparted the oral transmission. After bowing in gratitude, Yong offered more wine, and they drank deeply until dusk, when the Perfected One vanished like the wind. An extraordinary fragrance lingered in the household for half a month.\nFrom then on, Yaofu seldom ventured out, withdrawing from worldly affairs to nurture his vast nature and delight in heaven. Later, his practice grew ever more refined, and he composed a poem:\n*At the winter solstice, midnight’s half,*\n*The heart of heaven remains unchanged.*\n*Where the single yang first stirs,*\n*All things are yet unborn.*\n*The wine of mystery tastes faint,*\n*The great sound is scarcely heard.*\n*If you doubt these words,*\n*Ask Fuxi again.*\n\n**Thirty-Fifth Transformation: The Divine Warning of Lord Chen**\nLord Chen Zhizhong built a grand estate in the capital and hosted a grand feast, gathering relatives and friends for revelry. Though Chen had long followed the Dao and harmonized his *qi* with virtue, a ragged Daoist—none other than Lü Dongbin—appeared and asked, “What skills do you possess?”\nThe Daoist replied, “I have a set of immortal music. Would you like me to perform it to grace your feast?”\nFrom his sleeve, he produced a scroll of paintings, which he hung on a pillar. It depicted twelve immortal maidens, each holding a musical instrument. The Daoist called to them as if they were real, and they lined up before him. Two maidens bearing ceremonial banners led the way, while the others played their instruments. All were fair as jade and flowers, their beauty and voices enchanting. They wore seven-jeweled crowns and six-ounce robes, their golden pendants and jade ornaments chiming softly as they moved. On each maiden’s nose was a grain of yellow jade, yet their forms were ethereal, unlike living beings. Their music soared clear and bright to the heavens, its melodies unlike anything heard before.\nAfter three pieces, Chen asked, “What sort of women are these?”\nThe Daoist replied, “These are the Jade Maidens of the Six Jia and Six Ding. When one cultivates the Dao to perfection, the three *hun* souls, seven *po* souls, five viscera, and six bowels within the body all transform into such beings. Would you like to learn?”\nChen, deeming it mere illusion, was displeased. The Daoist turned to the maidens and said, “You may go,” and they all returned to the scroll. The Daoist then took the scroll, opened his mouth, and swallowed it. He asked for paper and brush and wrote boldly:\n*I have endured three thousand kalpas in heaven,*\n*And five hundred years among men.*\n*My waist’s sword flashes like purple lightning,*\n*My crucible’s elixir flames rise in azure smoke.*\n*Now riding a white deer across the sea,*\n*Now straddling a green ox into the grotto-heaven.*\n*Such minor arts are but trifles to amuse—*\n*Who among mortals knows I am an immortal?*\nAt the end, he signed: *Inscribed by the Valley Guest.*\nThen he departed, vanishing in an instant. Chen realized the Valley Guest was Lü Dongbin and, filled with remorse, wished to tear out his eyes. Soon after, he passed away.\n\n**Thirty-Sixth Transformation: The Divine Inquiry of Master Xu**\nXu Shenweng of Hailing had attained the Dao and could foresee the fortunes and misfortunes of others. His home was always filled with guests. When Lü Huiqing came to visit, a Daoist was already seated in the place of honor and refused to rise, even hurling insults at Huiqing.\n\nHuiqing, indignant and aggrieved, demanded, “Who are you?” The Daoist replied, “You and I share the same ancestral lineage.”\n\nThe Daoist scattered incense-burner ash upon the ground and inscribed a *ci* poem in the ash:\n\n*Within the crucible, Kan and Li unite;*\n*In the gourd, heaven and earth reside.*\n*My breast brims with wind and moon—*\n*In one breath, I swallow the void.*\n*Within the dusty world, who knows me?*\n*I open my mouth to ask.*\n*Amid primordial chaos in the clouds,*\n*Thrice I play my flute.*\n*Beyond Yueyang Tower,*\n*The sky stretches far, the rosy clouds glow.*\n*Laughing, I ride the yellow crane,*\n*Passing briefly east of Hailing.*\n*With a sweep of my sleeve, I depart, laughing aloud—*\n*Jade pendants chime, phoenix bells ring,*\n*Wind whispers through towering pines.*\n*If you wish to know my traces,*\n*Ask the immortal elder.*\n\nHe clapped his hands, burst into laughter, and departed, vanishing without a trace. Huiqing questioned Xu, who replied, “That was Dongbin.” Only then did Huiqing grasp the meaning of “shared lineage” and, filled with remorse, lamented that it was too late to make amends.\n\n**Thirty-Seventh Transformation: Huiqing’s Second Encounter**\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, Huiqing was stationed as the prefect of Shanzhou at the Tianqing Abbey. On the seventh day of the seventh month, a strange figure passed by and inscribed two poems on paper. The first read:\n\n*A lone wanderer roams the four seas,*\n*Two gourds of frost and snow sustain my spirit.*\n*Kan and Li I have now gathered—*\n*Dragon-tiger elixir refined, mercury set in motion.*\n\nThe second read:\n\n*This wanderer was once a guest of Tiantai,*\n*South of the stone bridge lies my old abode.*\n*Father and son—born with two mouths,*\n*Much fond of singing, never of clapping.*\n\nHuiqing’s son-in-law, Yu Zhong, deciphered them, saying, “The first line of the latter poem: *guest* (宾) means ‘visitor.’ The second: *stone bridge* (石桥) signifies ‘grotto’ (洞). The third: *two mouths* (两口) is ‘Lü’ (吕). The fourth: *singing* (歌) is ‘ling’ (昤). The one who composed this poem must be Lü Dongbin.”\n\n**Thirty-Eighth Transformation: The Healing of Teng Zhong’s Affliction**\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, in the Eastern Capital, a Daoist calling himself the Valley Guest drank with the commoner Teng Zhong. As he prepared to leave, he bequeathed a single pill to Teng. Teng suffered from a chronic ailment and had vowed to fast and seek the Dao, hoping to meet a true immortal who might grant him medicine. Upon taking the pill, he was instantly cured. Two years later, they encountered each other again across the water at the eastern side of the Open Bright Bridge in Yangzhou. The Guest sat by the water’s edge and beckoned; Teng took the path and crossed the bridge’s pillar to reach him. Upon arrival, the figure he had seen before was nowhere to be found. Only then did he realize it had been Lü Dongbin. Overcome with disappointment, he feigned madness and soon after passed away.\n\n**Thirty-Ninth Transformation: The Transcendence of Chen Xuande**\nXuande—whose surname was Chen—once encountered the Lord of the Dao, who bestowed upon him the *Great-Soled Divine Elixir*. It allowed him to run swiftly and never age. He composed two *ci* poems. The first:\n\n*In refining, the center divides;*\n*The ministerial fire is upheld.*\n*Externally, square shoes lend aid—*\n*Pure emptiness, clarity, and mastery reign.*\n*(Sixteen characters missing from the original.)*\n*The numinous treasure forms the embryo,*\n*The ten directions’ primordial extremity.*\n*When the supremely true arrives,*\n*In the dim and indistinct, mushroom cakes and feathered canopies appear.*\n\nThe second:\n\n*A day of pure joy—*\n*Where has it gone in ten years?*\n*Old affairs taken up anew,*\n*A gentle breeze, slanting sun arrive in Jiangnan.*\n*Spring fills the level lake with shimmering beauty.*\n*In hand, a yellow slip—*\n*Dragon script inscribed.*\n*Before the green carriage, phoenix glue and jade kings are harnessed.*\n*The Record of Purity and Truth is signed,*\n*With an immortal’s title.*\n*Offices are listed in the Numinous Terrace’s Book of Scribes.*\n\nLater, Xuande departed through *shijie* (corpse liberation).\n\n**Fortieth Transformation: The Divine Portrait**\nThe Lord of the Dao wandered to Shanyang’s Divine Radiance Abbey and, begging a brush, painted his own likeness on the northern wall of the Three Clarities Hall. His brows and eyes were finely wrought, his appearance ancient and strange—unlike any commonly transmitted image. Above him stood the Seven Great Star Lords of the Northern Dipper, their hair unbound, holding jade tablets and standing to the side. He inscribed a talisman over a *zhang* in length, writing: *“Composed in the second year of Yuanyou. If you know where my brush began, you may speak with me of the Dao.”* Those afflicted with illness scraped off the talisman and ingested it, often with excellent results.\n\n**Forty-First Transformation: The Spirit Stone Seeks Alms**\n\n**Forty-First Transformation: The Spirit Stone Seeks Alms**\nAt Lingshi Temple on the southern shore of West Lake in Hangzhou, four Daoist priests arrived one day to beg for alms. The monks had already ceased their midday meal and refused to receive them. One of the priests inscribed a six-line poem:\n\n*South of the cove, springs and stones repeat,*\n*West of the peak, mist and clouds layer deep.*\n*Who first ascended, leading the way?*\n*Yan, Ou, Li Jia, and Xiao Yun—companions they.*\n\nSome later interpreted it thus: the first line concealed the character *Lü* (吕), the second *Dong* (洞), the third *Bin* (宾), and the fourth named three individuals—surely Lord Lü and his companions. The characters were written backward on a wooden beam, and though scraped, they would not fade.\n\n**Forty-Second Transformation: The Ordination of a Monk in the Jingde Era**\nAt Emei Courtyard within Jingde Temple in the Eastern Capital, a monk from Shu arrived to serve as abbot, known as the Emei Daoist. His precepts were strict, and for twenty years, he never left his abbot’s quarters. One day, a strange figure—clad in a blue headscarf and white robe—arrived. The Daoist treated him with great courtesy. The visitor spoke with him arrogantly until midnight before departing, promising to return on the same day the following year. The attendant monks all witnessed this. The next year, at noon on the appointed day, the Daoist bathed, sat, and passed away. By evening, the strange figure returned, sighing endlessly, then vanished without a trace. The following day, on the highest point of the wall beside the hall, characters were found written in a soaring, dynamic script—like a dancing phoenix or soaring luan. The poem read:\n\n*The sun sets, the west wind slants,*\n*Tonight, my old friend departs.*\n*To come or not—why leave me waiting,*\n*Standing till the wutong’s shadow fades?*\n\nA small inscription read *Tong Xing Zuo* (同省作), concealing the characters *Dongbin* (洞宾) within its strokes.\n\n**Forty-Third Transformation: Wandering the Dayu Ridge**\nAt Dayu Ridge in Hengpu, a wealthy young man, enamored of the Dao, built a hermitage and hosted wandering scholars for many years. One day, as a grand Yellow Register Offering had just concluded, a ragged Daoist priest arrived seeking alms. The crowd, unaware of his worth, treated him with disdain and humiliation. The priest inscribed a *ci* poem on the wall:\n\n*For a time, I wander Hengpu,*\n*Who speaks with the white crane that flies through?*\n*By the ridge’s homestead,*\n*How many winters have seen the plum blossoms bloom?*\n*Spring comes, spring goes,*\n*Man lingers where petals drift on flowing streams.*\n*Flowers fill the path ahead,*\n*Hiding immortals—none know where they tread.*\n\nAt the end, he wrote *Yuan Xin Chang Lao Lai* (元心昌老来). The characters were rendered in three distinct styles. Upon finishing, he entered the cloud hall and did not emerge for a long while. When they searched, he was gone. Examining the writing, they found it had penetrated the wall behind. Only then did they realize *Chang* (昌) and *Yuan Xin* (元心) formed *Lü* (吕)—it was Lord Lü. The crowd sighed in remorse.\n\n**Forty-Fourth Transformation: The Ordination of Duke Zhongxian**\n\nDuke Zhongxian of Han, in his later years, took pleasure in hosting Daoist adepts. The Lord of the Empire arrived in tattered robes and a soiled face to seek an audience. Han regarded him lightly and asked, \"What can you do?\" The Lord replied, \"I can make ink.\" Han bade him demonstrate, so the Lord dug a pit in the ground and submerged himself within it. Displeased, Han watched as the Lord kneaded the mud from the pit into ink, declaring, \"It is done.\" He then departed. Han slowly retrieved the ink and examined it, only to find it was fine gold. Upon its surface was inscribed the character *Lü*; when split open, the character penetrated its very texture. Han regretted his earlier dismissal.\n\nLater, they met again, and the Lord bestowed upon him a transformative teaching. After three years of devoted cultivation, Han underwent *shijie* and ascended as an Immortal of the Purple Court.\n\n**Forty-Fifth Transformation: The Visit to Jiang Hui**\nDaoist Jiang Hui of Quanzhou was of lofty aspiration and conduct. When Lord Dongbin called upon him, Jiang happened to be away. The Lord inscribed a poem upon the wall:\n\n*Drunk, I dance and sing on the island’s peak,*\n*The celestial gourd catches dew to bathe the golden elixir.*\n*At night, I probe the crane’s path through the autumn sky’s wall—*\n*Ten thousand leagues of western wind, a sword’s chill.*\n\nBelow, he wrote: *Yuan Shangguan Zhu visits Jiang Hui.* He then departed, the characters penetrating the wall. Upon his return, Jiang was astonished, saying, \"The character *gong* with *Yuan Shang*—this is Lü’s boat!\" He pursued him but could not find him again.\n\n**Forty-Sixth Transformation: The Gift of Medicine to Huang Jue**\n\n**Forty-Sixth Transformation: The Gift of Medicine to Huang Jue**\nHuang Jue was skilled in poetry but had not yet attained official rank. One day, as he saw a guest off beyond the Eastern Capital’s gate, he arrived only to find the guest already departed, beyond pursuit. At his lodging, he saw a Daoist adept and, spreading out a mat and wine, invited the adept to share them. When they had finished, the adept raised his cup, scooped water, and wrote the character *Lü* upon the table, saying, \"Next year, we shall meet in Jiangnan.\" Then he vanished in a flutter. Huang then realized it was Lord Dongbin. The following year, Huang was indeed transferred to an office in Jiangnan, where he again met Dongbin. The Lord gave him seven large coins, ten medium ones, and three small ones, saying, \"This number cannot be increased. I shall leave you with a few inches of medicine. On New Year’s Day, grind it with wine and take it—you will be free of illness for a year.\" Huang followed his instructions, and by the age of seventy-three, the medicine was nearly exhausted. He wrote a poem:\n\n*No calendar by my bed,*\n*Counting children on my fingers now.*\n*At seventy-three years old,*\n*He passed away.*\n\n**Forty-Seventh Transformation: The Enlightenment of Physician Li**\nLi Decheng of the Eastern Capital was a skilled physician with a reverent heart for the Dao and great compassion. He often saved the poor and suffering, accumulating hidden virtue. On a bitterly cold day, he encountered a destitute Daoist adept wearing only a single layer of clothing, his face pale with cold. The adept invited Li into a wineshop and took the seat of honor, which Li found strange. The proprietor said, \"Pay for the wine first.\" The adept pointed to three wine jars in the shop and said, \"Each contains a pint of wine money.\" The proprietor did not believe him at first but checked and found it to be true, so he gave them three pints of wine. The adept poured and drank, while Li took only one jar—the other two emptied themselves. The adept said to Li, \"This is but a small art. I am Lü Dongbin.\" Li was astonished and overjoyed. The adept wrote a quatrain:\n\n*The Son of Heaven within the ninefold palace is honored,*\n*The five ranks of nobles beyond are revered.*\n*Yet how can they compare to the carefree commoner,*\n*Who does not entrust his life and fate to Heaven and Earth?*\n\nLi did not grasp its meaning. The adept left him with a single pill, saying, \"Take this, and you shall enjoy long life.\" Then he departed. After taking the pill, Li’s hair did not turn white, his teeth did not fall out, and he lived to the age of one hundred and seven before passing away.\n\n**Forty-Eighth Transformation: The Inscription Left at the Convent**\nWithin the Eastern Capital’s An Yuan Gate stood a convent. The founding master wished to deliver a certain person, but their karmic affinity was shallow, and they did not come. On the eastern wall of the eastern gate, he wrote a poem, the ink penetrating more than three inches deep, the brushwork powerful and vigorous:\n\n*The Azure Dragon lingers here, hesitant,*\n*In the quiet night, the clouds drift idly—still they do not come.*\n*Knowing there is one whose karmic bonds may change their bones,*\n*I leave this true trace for a time, awaiting Mount Tiantai.*\n\nThe character *hui* (徊) was written only half—its meaning pointed to Dongbin.\n\n**Forty-Ninth Transformation: The Gift of Medicine to the Ma Family**\nDuring a year of widespread malarial fever in the Eastern Capital, Lord Dongbin manifested universally, turning all away.\n\nAn elderly woman of the Ma family was offering tea as alms when all her children and grandchildren fell ill. One day, a Daoist arrived, and the old woman treated him kindly, pleading for her descendants’ sickness. The Daoist said, “Wait for me at dawn tomorrow.” The woman rose early to await him, and he gave her medicine wrapped in crimson gauze. “When the illness strikes, hold this and you will recover,” he instructed. One pellet could cure a hundred people, but once a hundred were healed, it would no longer work. The woman followed his words, and her children and grandchildren were cured. When the hundredth person was treated, the medicine indeed failed. She opened the pouch to find no medicine left—only the three characters *Lü Dongbin*.\n\n**Fiftieth Transformation: The Rescue of a Filial Son’s Mother**\nIn Tonglu, Prefect Shen Zhizhen’s mother suffered from a carbuncle on her back, and no remedy could relieve her. His prayers were fervent, and his filial devotion moved Heaven. Lord Dongbin came to her in the night and said, “Your utmost filial piety has touched the heavens, and I have been sent to save her. Had it been one day later, she could not have been cured.” He then bestowed upon him the *Divine Treasure Ointment* formula: take five *gualou* fruits and five pieces of fine frankincense, each the size of a jujube, grind them finely, and simmer with one *jin* of white honey to form a paste. Each dose of three *qian*, dissolved in warm wine, would greatly heal carbuncles, malignant sores, swellings, and fistulas. His mother took it and recovered at once. Prefect Shen painted an image of Dongbin and revered it morning and evening.\n\n*The Wondrous Transformations of the Divine Lord Pure Yang, Scroll Four* concludes.\n\n---\n*The Wondrous Transformations of the Divine Lord Pure Yang, Scroll Five*\nCollated and compiled by Miao Shanshi of the Mystic Gate, with poems and illustrations\n\n**Fifty-First Transformation: The Tea Offering to the Great Cloud Monk**\nLord Dongbin disguised himself as the Recluse Hui and visited Great Cloud Temple. He took meals in the Assembly Hall for over a month, then said to the monks, “Your vegetarian fare is excellent, but you lack tea.” He departed, and ten days later returned with a small amount of tea. He prepared it himself in the kitchen, and several hundred monks were sated. Monk Zhiming invited the recluse for tea and recited a poem by Minister Ding: *“Flowers break along the monk’s whisk, clouds follow the guest’s bowl round.”* The recluse said, “The lines are fine, but they do not fully capture the essence of tea.” He then wrote a poem:\n\n*A jade-tipped spear proclaims the rarest grade,*\n*The monk’s craft demands meticulous care.*\n*In shallow hare’s-fur bowls, fragrant clouds gleam white,*\n*In frog-eye brew, snow-like waves rise and float.*\n*It banishes the sleep-demon from desk and mat,*\n*And sharpens the pure qi to refresh flesh and bone.*\n*Delighting in seclusion by the cliffs’ embrace,*\n*It refuses to transplant its roots to the capital’s throne.*\n\nThe monk presented a poem in return:\n*“Seeking truth, I’ve found the true—*\n*Only Master Lü remains.*\n*In my basket, naught but verse,*\n*In my furnace, silver flames.*\n*Your nature, pure as ancient days,*\n*Your spirit, warm as spring’s own rays.*\n*One day on Cloud Bridge’s path,*\n*How might I draw near your way?”*\n\nThe recluse responded:\n*A wanderer three thousand li from home,*\n*A cloud-roving hand for seven hundred years.*\n*When my deeds are full, Penglai becomes my lodge,*\n*When the Dao is perfected, tiles and stones turn gold.*\n*In my wine jar, wine for guests is ever stored,*\n*In my furnace, spring’s alchemy unfolds.*\n*Who fears a lack of teachers when virtue’s sown?*\n*Since ancient times, Heaven and Earth show no favor to kin.*\n\nHe then left the monk a single elixir pellet, saying, “Take this, and you will not die.” He departed, and later the monk too ascended as an immortal.\n\n**Fifty-Second Transformation: The Persuasion of Hou Yonghui**\nLord Dongbin traveled to Jiangzhou’s Mount Lu, to the Simplicity and Quiet Abbey, where he tempered his sword by the steps. Daoist Hou Yonghui asked him, “What is its use?” He replied, “All the injustices of the world will be swept away by it.” Hou found this strange and shared wine and fruit with him, saying, “Your Daoist bearing is lofty and pure—you cannot be an ordinary man of this dusty world.” Lord Dongbin said, “Let us drink deeply; there’s no need for exhaustive inquiry.” Once drunk, he dipped a chopstick in wine and wrote a poem on the wall with his sword:\n\n*Who dares shrink from honing the blade’s keen edge?*\n*At dawn, the jade dragon roars as the case is opened.*\n*In my hand, the qi’s might freezes three feet of ice;*\n*On the stone, the spirit coils like a single snake.*\n*Villains’ blood silently follows the flowing stream,*\n*Wicked grease wholly dissolves the old scars.*\n*To shear away the world’s injustices,*\n*I’ll ascend the nine heavens with you in tow.*\n\nAt first, the words seemed invisible, but soon the ink gathered and glowed, penetrating through to the other side of the wall.\n\nThe lord was greatly startled and pressed further, asking about sword arts. Dongbin replied, “There is the Dao-sword and the method-sword. The Dao-sword transcends form, while the method-sword serves as defense. What common eyes perceive is merely the latter—capable only of dispelling demons and banishing malevolent spirits.”\n\nThe lord asked, “If one were to slay a treacherous villain with the Dao-sword amidst a throng, would it not be witnessed by the vulgar?”\n\nDongbin said, “The Dao-sword is the sword of loyalty, cutting away only one’s own delusions and falsehoods. The method-sword, however, is for defense—and operates differently. It takes spirit as its mother and the blade as its child: where spirit abides, the blade abides; where spirit departs, the blade disperses. Cherish the spirit, treasure the blade, and with these strike down the unrighteous—such are the ways of gods and demons.”\n\nThe lord exclaimed, “Truly the words of an immortal!” and begged to know his name. Dongbin replied, “I am Lü Yan.” With that, he cast himself into the air and vanished, leaving the lord filled with bitter regret. Only after a long while did he disappear from sight.\n\n---\n\n**The Fifty-Third Transformation: Playful Revelry at Rainbow Bridge**\n\nAt Suzhou’s Rainbow Bridge, a ragged Daoist arrived one day, carrying wine to the bridge pavilion. There, he drank alone in leisure, chanting and singing from dawn till dusk, his spirit as light as the drifting wind. The crowd marveled at his drinking—from morning to evening, his capacity far exceeded mortal measure, yet no vessel seemed to hold his wine.\n\nWhen asked his name, the Daoist took the ashes from a temple incense burner and inscribed a lyric on a pillar:\n\n*A flying beam presses the water,*\n*The rainbow’s reflection sinks in clarity.*\n*Mornings wrapped in tangerine mist,*\n*Half the fishing village veiled in grassy smoke.*\n*From ancient times to now,*\n*Things change, people fade.*\n\n**Within heaven and earth, only the rivers and mountains remain ageless.**\nBeneath rain-woven hat and wind-tattered hood,\nwho across the four seas would know this Daoist?\nA single sword cleaves the void—how many times has it arrived?\nThe jade dragon’s neighing never ceases,\nas the moon, cold and bright, returns to the waves.\nWhich immortal seals the Purple Ultimate Grotto-Heaven?\nPointing to the cloud-screened misty barrier—there is my hut.\nLet moss carpet the ground in its fullness;\nyear after year, I do not return.\n\nPostscript: *I am Lü Dongbin.*\n\nThe crowd, astonished, pursued him, but in an instant he vanished.\n\n---\n\n**The Fifty-Fourth Transformation: Visiting Master Nie the Alchemist**\n\nAt Jiangzhou’s Taiping Abbey, the Daoist Master Xue held lofty aspirations. When the Perfected Lord passed through, he bestowed a poem:\n\n*A fallen wanderer, Daoist Xue,*\n*aged yet beardless.*\n*Amid clouds, he idly moves stones;*\n*in snow, he seeks steles.*\n*He boasts of drinking great wine,*\n*disdains those who recite petty verses.*\n*What manner of man is he?*\n*Let the vulgar mock as they will.*\n\nA brief postscript read: *The Returning Daoist, with three companions, visits Alchemist Xue.*\n\nOnly then did they realize *Lü Dongbin* was concealed within the characters.\n\n---\n\n**The Fifty-Fifth Transformation: Tempting the Southern Daoist**\n\nAt Suzhou’s Fuli County, in the Tianqing Abbey, lived the Daoist Yu, who from youth had studied the *Zhuangzi* and *Laozi*, possessing an extraordinary spirit. One morning, as he rose, a traveling medicine-selling Daoist arrived—none other than Lü Dongbin. His bearing was majestic, and he stayed for over a month. Though the Perfected Lord wished to initiate him, their minds did not align. At parting, he inscribed two quatrains on the door in grand seal script, the brushwork soaring and dynamic:\n\n*I.*\n*Autumn’s desolation—scattered leaves take flight,*\n*Beneath the pine’s shadow, time drifts as I sit.*\n*Clouds veil the crane-drawn chariot—where has it gone?*\n*The immortal’s morning audience at the grotto-heaven has missed my turn.*\n\n*II.*\n*For a thousand years, the elixir talisman guards the arm,*\n*While the* Huangting *scripture’s inner vision is chanted aloud.*\n*Amid the crane’s abode, the ancient altar, pine shadows deep,*\n*Silent and still, the door remains ajar—no human trace.*\n\nAfter he departed, people rushed to carve out the characters to cure illnesses, and many were healed. The script had sunk a full inch into the wood, yet the ink remained unfaded.\n\n---\n\n**The Fifty-Sixth Transformation: Initiating the Courtesan Hou**\n\nIn Yanzhou, a courtesan surnamed Hou kept lodgings for travelers. The Perfected Lord, disguised, sought her services, leaving at dawn and returning at dusk, always drunk. For over a month, he paid not a single coin. Hou summoned him for tea, and Lü Dongbin said: *\"Master Zhongli told me you are one with whom the Dao may be discussed.\"*\n\nHou, uncomprehending, plied him with wine. The Perfected Lord drank without cease, growing increasingly displeased. Extending his arm, he revealed a golden hairpin beneath his sleeve, removed one, and bade her sell it for wine. Hou, coveting the gold, said: *\"After drinking, will you stay the night?\"*\n\n*\"Very well,\"* he replied.\n\nHe ascended the bed and snored loudly. By midnight, Hou approached the bed, but the Perfected Lord thrust out his hand, repelling her, and sharply ordered her away. At daybreak, he was gone. On her back, where his hand had struck, the character *Lü* was branded deep into her flesh.\n\nHou, awakened, thought: *\"This is Lord Lü! Had I not erred in a single thought in a past life, would I have come to this? Has he come to deliver me?\"*\n\nShe immediately cut her hair, donned coarse cloth, and sought out Lü Dongbin. Upon meeting again, she received the Dao and vanished, her fate unknown.\n\n**The Fifty-Seventh Transformation: Tempting the Minister**\n\nMinisterial Gentleman Jia Shixiong of the Ministry of Works kept an ancient iron mirror, which he once wished to temper and polish. The Perfected Lord, posing as a wandering guest, paid him a visit. At first, he spoke only of the Dao, but Jia did not comprehend. The next day, the guest begged to test his skill. From his bamboo case, he took a pinch of medicine, placed it on the mirror, and departed, saying: *\"Wait a moment, and I shall return.\"* The medicine’s trace had vanished, but upon the door of the Taiping Temple where he lodged, a poem appeared:\n\n*\"In hand, a green serpent soars beneath the sun,\nWithin the cave, immortal fruits bloom ever bright.\nKnow this: the cloud-wreathed guest beyond the world\nIs not the man who grinds mirrors in the dust.\"*\n\n---\n\n**The Fifty-Eighth Transformation: Tempting Kuang Ruogu**\n\nAt the Hermit’s Abbey on Mount Qingcheng, the Daoist Kuang Ruogu possessed a noble bearing, his precepts and conduct pure and strict. He often used talismanic water from the Heart of Heaven and the Three Luminaries to cure illnesses, with remarkable efficacy. Yet whatever money or silk he received, he immediately distributed to the poor.\n\nThe Perfected Lord, disguising himself as Master Guest, paid him a visit and stayed for over a month. The talismans he drew would often rise into the air, transforming into dragons and serpents that vanished into mist and cloud. When he summoned spirits or generals, their forms would manifest, speaking in human tongues. His feet stamped the earth to raise thunder, his eyes flashed to strike lightning, his breath darkened into clouds, and his spittle scattered into rain.\n\nHe was also skilled in painting without brush or ink—merely holding water in his mouth and spraying it onto silk or paper, whereupon mountains, rivers, flowers, trees, palaces, birds, beasts, and figures would naturally appear, requiring only a light touch to refine. The money he earned from selling these paintings, he spent on wine, drinking deeply with Ruogu. Ruogu, though accustomed to vast quantities of liquor, was always bested by his guest.\n\nOne day, Ruogu asked: *\"Sir, your conduct is unlike that of ordinary men. You must have come from among the immortals. Might you speak to me of the Dao?\"*\n\nThe guest replied: *\"The seven stars of the Northern Dipper are missing one from your left foot. How could you attain the Dao? Another lifetime will be needed.\"*\n\nRuogu was astonished: *\"Master Guest is truly a sage! Beneath my left foot is a black mole shaped like the Northern Dipper, lacking one star—something no one has ever known.\"* He then asked how long he might live.\n\nThe Perfected Lord wrote ninety-four characters in reverse upon the wall, arranging them into two interlocking circles before departing. Only then did Ruogu realize the two circles formed the character *Lü*—his guest’s surname. Later, Ruogu died at the age of ninety-four, fulfilling the reversed writing’s prophecy.\n\n**Poetic Image:**\n*The master refined the mysterious in profound stillness,\nResponding to the moment, his method natural and free.\nRuogu, proud and scornful of the Dao,\nMust wait another life—no path to immortality.*\n\n---\n\n**The Fifty-Ninth Transformation: Delivering the Brush-Maker**\n\nOn Green River, the brush-maker Zhai was fond of hosting wandering adepts. The Perfected Lord visited him, and Zhai lodged him at his home with the utmost courtesy. From then on, they came and went for over a year.\n\nOne day, the Perfected Lord took Zhai boating on the river. He split a brush shaft in two and set the pieces adrift upon the waves. Stepping onto one half, he beckoned Zhai to follow. Terrified, Zhai dared not move, but the Perfected Lord laughed and crossed to the shore. In an instant, he vanished. Only then did Zhai realize he was an extraordinary man.\n\nTen days later, the Perfected Lord returned, bringing food for Zhai—all of it rotten and foul. Zhai pinched his nose and refused to eat. The Perfected Lord sighed: *\"Since you cannot stomach coarse fare, I shall leave you two jars of meat sauce.\"* He departed and was seen no more. When Zhai opened the jars, they were filled with gold flakes—not two great vats, but two small vessels.\n\n**Poetic Image:**\n*For over a year, they came and went, companions true,\nYet Zhai’s virtue was not unaccompanied.\nRefusing the foul food, he spurned the boat’s ascent—\nAlas, his share of immortality slipped away.*\n\n---\n\n**The Sixtieth Transformation: Delivering the Courtesan Huang Ying**\n\nIn Guangling, the courtesan Huang Ying was renowned for her beauty. Wealthy patrons crowded her door, yet she took pleasure in aiding the poor and giving alms. One day, a certain Lü the Scholar—none other than Dongbin—sought lodging. Huang, seeing his shabby and filthy state, turned him away.\n\nThe scholar wrote two poems upon her screen:\n\n*I.*\n*\"Mengmu and Xishi shared this frame,\nYet age and youth stand far apart.\nOne day, a crone with crane-white hair,\nToday, a face like flowers, fair.\"*\n\n*II.*\n*\"Flowers bloom and fade, two joys, two sorrows,\nFlower and mortal share the same fate.\nWhile on the branch, beware the plucking hand,\nFallen to earth, who then will gaze?\"*\n\nWhen he finished writing, he vanished in an instant. Huang, awakened, sought to gouge out her eyes.\n\n**Poetic Image:**\n*Illusion shapes the body, a borrowed shell,\nGreed for wealth and lust for beauty sever true kinship.\nIn action and stillness, speech and silence—who is master?\nWho perceives the lord within the center?*\n\n**And again:**\n*All day, she sold her smiles and chased delight,\nYet how much hidden virtue did she store?\nThe true immortal came to save her soul,\nBut alas, her blessings were too thin to bear.*\n\n---\n\n**The Sixty-First Transformation: Playful Wandering in Yueyang**\n\nThe Perfected Lord wandered to Yueyang, disguising himself as a medicine peddler. He priced each pill at a thousand gold, yet after three days, none were sold. He then ascended Yueyang Tower and consumed his own medicine. Suddenly, he stood suspended in midair. The crowd, startled, longed for his elixir. The Perfected Lord laughed: *\"The Dao lies before your eyes, a step from Penglai’s fields. Yet you grasp the trigger but do not loose the arrow—missing what is right in front of you.\"*\n\nHe then recited a poem:\n*\"At dawn, I roam the northern seas; by dusk, the dark southern woods.\nIn my sleeve, a green serpent—my gall bold as the sun.\nThree days in Yueyang, and none knew me,\nAs I soared, chanting, over Dongting Lake.\"*\n\n**Poetic Image:**\n*The immortal soars like a phoenix perched on wu-tung,\nForgetting both concealment and display, essence and form.\nHis wondrous medicine could deliver men, yet none knew,\nWhile his virtuous breeze swept the river and lake.*\n\n---\n\n**The Sixty-Second Transformation: Saving Supervisor Zhao**\n\nSupervisor Zhao Yingdao of the Bureau of Imperial Regalia fell gravely ill, nearing death. Exhausted, he wept as he bid farewell to his kin: *\"I am dying. Of all the things I possess, I would willingly part with them—save for my white-haired parents, whom I must entrust to you. What is to be done?\"*\n\nBefore he could finish speaking, a Daoist suddenly knocked at the door. He said to Zhao: *\"Your illness is not difficult to cure.\"* He took two sheets of paper, cut a hole in each the size of a plate, and handed them to Zhao: *\"Tonight, burn one sheet, mix the ashes with frankincense-infused water, and apply it to the afflicted area. Keep the other for those who come after.\"*\n\nThe Daoist spoke thus and departed. Zhao applied the medicine, and by dawn, he had fully recovered. Overjoyed, he sought the Daoist but found no trace. Only then did he realize the two plate-sized holes formed the character \"Lü\" (吕). A poem was composed in praise:\n\n*\"Supervisor Zhao’s filial piety filled the heavens,\nHis devotion moved the merciful immortals, Lü’s twin sages.\nCured, he sought the truth—yet the truth had vanished,\nThe unspoken legacy of salvation passed through the heart.\"*\n\n**The Sixty-Third Transformation: Guiding Scholar Cui**\n\nScholar Cui, having passed the imperial examinations, traveled through Baling and lodged at an inn, where he sang the lyric *\"Spring in the Qin Garden.\"* The Perfected Lord, wandering incognito by Pu Creek amid the marketplace, inquired about the song. Cui replied, *\"It is a new tune from the capital.\"* The Lord said, *\"I shall compose a verse to match it, but I cannot write. I will sing it, and you shall transcribe it for me.\"* Cui obliged, and the lyrics read:\n\n*\"The elixir of seven returns and nine refinements\nDemands first the tempering of self, awaiting the hour.\nWhen the primal yang stirs at midnight,\nThe clepsydra’s waters flow long.\nThe lead cauldron warms, its glow piercing the curtains,\nAs creation races, tiger and dragon entwine.\nThe fire-tending work ascends to Ox and Dipper’s perilous heights.\nBy Qujiang’s banks, the moon’s radiance gleams pure—\nA crow takes flight, having tasted the knife’s measure.\nWho would believe the elder brother nurtured from nothing?\nDiscern the water’s source—clear or turbid—\nThe barrier between wood and metal.\nWithout a master’s guidance, this truth remains obscure.\nThe Dao’s subtleties, the heavens’ mysteries—\nEven hastening to begin, one fears it may be too late.\nOn Penglai’s path, with three thousand merits fulfilled,\nOne strides alone into the clouds’ return.\"*\n\nCui asked his name. The Lord replied, *\"I was born by the river’s mouth, raised by the mountain’s mouth, and now dwell as a guest guarding the valley.\"* The next day, Cui recounted this to the prefect, who exclaimed, *\"That was Lü Dongbin!\"* They rushed to summon him, but as they knocked, the voice receded into the distance. Calling again yielded no response. They pushed open the door—no one was there. On the wall, a poem remained:\n\n*\"The infant within my belly is fully nurtured,\nYet I linger in the dusty market for fleeting amusement.\nFoolish scholars wag their tongues without cause—\nI retreat into the depths of white clouds.\"*\n\nCui and the prefect sighed in regret, then composed a matching verse:\n\n*\"From the birth of yang, at the heart of stillness,\nWhen silence reaches its extreme, the earth’s thunder trembles.\nThe jade gate bursts open, the heavens’ heart shines clear.\nLowering the curtains, the true fire surges and melts.\nThe numinous spring resounds, the valley spirit unobscured—what peril remains?\nNaturally wondrous, like the Three Rivers,\nA dragon leaps, a roc soars ninety thousand li.\nThe central earth forms the double-gemmed elixir,\nAffection lingers thick as a mother shielding her child.\nIn this trance, the true visage—neither empty nor form—\nA profound, subtle image.\nWithout knowledge, without perception,\nLife abides in the cinnabar’s perfection.\nWith wholehearted devotion, cultivate the true Dao,\nDelay no longer—complete the work.\nGrasp the three powers’ principles, unify and return them all.\"*\n\nA poem in reflection:\n\n*\"The great elixir of dual-natured life is complete,\nThe master pities the worthy, expounding the Dao’s truth.\nThe prefect, now enlightened, sought to pay homage—\nHow could the patriarch deign to linger?\"*\n\n**The Sixty-Fourth Transformation: Bestowing the Elixir in Chengdu**\n\nIn the medicine market of Chengdu, a Daoist with a filthy face and tattered robes appeared daily, holding a single elixir pill. He cried out in the streets, *\"I am Lü Dongbin! Whoever bows to me shall receive this pill.\"* The crowd dismissed him as mad, gathering to mock and ridicule him, some even heaping abuse. The Daoist paid no heed, pacing the market’s lanes again and again.\n\nAs night fell and no one had come to bow, the Daoist went to sit by the fire pit before the Five Manifestations Temple. Children gathered, pelting him with tiles and stones, but the Daoist only smiled and said, *\"The world longs to see me, yet having seen me, they do not recognize me—such is fate.\"* Then he swallowed the elixir himself. Suddenly, five-colored clouds enveloped him, and in an instant, he vanished. The crowd was filled with remorse.\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"A single golden elixir could have bridged the green,\nYet clearly shown, they wove their own illusions.\nThe world’s meager fortune lightly cast aside—\nThey saw the true immortal yet missed the mystery.\"*\n\n**The Sixty-Fifth Transformation: Testing Chen Danran**\n\nChen Danran was a wealthy scholar who admired the Dao. For years, he hosted wandering Daoists, yet none proved worthy. The Perfected Lord disguised himself as a laborer, tending Chen’s garden for over a year. Though he worked twice as hard as others, Chen merely treated him as a hired hand. One day, Chen and a Daoist friend discussed the *Yin Fu Jing*, pausing at the lines: *\"When Heaven unleashes its killing force, dragons and serpents rise from the land; when man unleashes his killing force, Heaven and Earth are overturned.\"* They could not fathom the meaning of \"killing force.\" The laborer interjected loudly: *\"That which gives life does not live; that which brings death does not die. To kill life after it is born, or to learn death before it comes—this is the way to long life.\"* Chen was astonished: *\"You are but a laborer—who taught you such words?\"* When pressed, the man only spoke nonsense, his words incomprehensible. The friend scoffed: *\"Some rustic must have overheard this somewhere—he doesn’t truly understand it.\"* Soon after, the laborer took leave of Chen, saying, *\"I must journey far. I will return on the fifth day of the fifth month next year.\"* He departed without a trace.\n\nLater, a villager of Chen’s, traveling in Baling, encountered the man, who said: *\"Tell Master Chen I am Lü Dongbin. Had he been ready, I would have transmitted the Dao. But I observed him further, and he was not. I will not return.\"* With that, he strode into the bamboo grove before the Lüxian Pavilion and vanished. On the fifth day of the fifth month the following year, at noon, Chen suddenly died.\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"For years he sought the Dao and questioned masters—\nWhy did the true immortal descend in vain?\nHe spoke plainly of life and death’s profound mystery,\nYet Danran remained empty, still empty.\"*\n\n**The Sixty-Sixth Transformation: The Governor’s Chess Match**\n\nThe governor of Wuchang was playing chess one day when an unnamed Daoist approached and declared, *\"I can play.\"* The governor tested him, and after only eight moves, the Daoist said, *\"You have lost.\"* The governor protested: *\"The board is not yet full—how can you know?\"* The Daoist replied: *\"My pieces control the key paths—thus I know.\"* And indeed, the governor lost. After several games, all ending in defeat, the Daoist suddenly brushed his sleeves and disappeared. The governor sent men to search the city. They heard flute music near the government office, but when they arrived, the sound came from the East Gate. Rushing there, they heard it at the West Gate; at the West Gate, it shifted to the South Gate; at the South Gate, to the North Gate; and at the North Gate, to the Yellow Crane Tower. The Daoist entered a stone pavilion and vanished, leaving only a poem:\n\n*\"Fluting at Yellow Crane Tower,\nWhite duckweed, red reeds mirror the river’s edge.\nDeep feelings yearn to be spoken, yet none understand—\nOnly the clear wind and bright moon know.\"*\n\nAt the end was a small character: *\"Lü.\"*\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"The game revealed victory and defeat in an instant,\nA bright moon hung over the waters’ edge.\nIn vain they chased the sound through four gates—\nThey could not grasp the move within the board.\"*\n\n**The Sixty-Seventh Transformation: The Seven Sons’ Trial**\n\nChen Qizi, a barber, and his wife ran a tea shop where they offered haircuts and shaves. One day, a Daoist arrived carrying a silver ingot and asked for a shave. No sooner was his hair cut than it regrew; as soon as it regrew, it was cut again. From dawn till dusk, the couple’s hands nearly fell from exhaustion. Realizing he was no ordinary man, they asked, *\"Will you teach us the Dao?\"* The Daoist replied, *\"I will return tomorrow.\"* Chen rose early to wait, but the Daoist never came. Months passed in silence. Chen abandoned his trade and wandered as a mendicant in search of him, yet after decades, he found no trace. His resolve wavered, and he thought of returning home. After traveling five *li*, he suddenly saw the Daoist emerge from the mountains. *\"I am Lü Dongbin,\"* the man said. *\"With such sincerity, how could you not attain the Dao?\"* He transmitted the elixir formula and gave a poem:\n\n*\"Hand in hand we ascend to the Jade Emperor’s realm,\nA bond from past lives, no common thread.\nWith you, a turn of the golden blade’s hand—\nShave away the endless frost upon your head.\"*\n\nFrom then on, Qizi cultivated diligently. After achieving realization, he departed with his master.\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"After ten years of despair, he turned toward home—\nThe true immortal, moved by his devotion, spoke the eternal truth.\nIn winter’s frozen earth, red flames arise;\nIn summer’s scorching heat, snow and frost descend.\"*\n\n**The Sixty-Eighth Transformation: Selling Ink in Wuchang**\n\nThe Perfected Lord wandered through Wuchang, disguising himself as an ink merchant.\n\nThe ink was barely over an inch in size, yet priced at three thousand coins. For days, it found no buyer, and the crowd mocked and ridiculed him. A butcher named Wang remarked, *\"The ink is small, yet the price is steep—does it hold some hidden value?\"* He then spent three thousand coins to buy a bamboo shoot and invited the merchant to drink until drunk before returning home. Deep in slumber past midnight, there came a knock at the door. It was the merchant, returning the money and bidding farewell. Upon inspection, the ink had transformed into a piece of purple gold, bearing the character *\"Lü.\"* Searching for the merchant again proved futile, for he had vanished without a trace.\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"A single ink for three thousand—intent profound,\nOnly the One who knows the Dao could fathom its sound.\nThough the butcher Wang saw with keen sight,\nHe gained the gold but lost the heart’s light.\"*\n\n**The Sixty-Ninth Transformation: Selling a Filthy Comb at a High Price**\n\nThe Perfected Lord wandered to the Tianxin Bridge in Wuchang, where he sold a shabby, filthy wooden comb. He set the price at a thousand coins, yet for months, no one purchased it. Soon, an elderly beggar woman, over eighty years old, hobbled by—her back bent, her hair as white as frost. The Perfected Lord said to her, *\"People chase what lies before their eyes, yet when they see me selling this shabby, filthy item at a high price, do they grasp my true intent? Among thousands, not one possesses insight—how then can they advance upon the Way?\"* He then gave the comb to the old woman to arrange her hair. With each stroke, her hair grew longer, black as raven’s wings, cascading to the ground, and her appearance grew youthful. The onlookers, struck with awe, clamored to buy the comb. The Perfected Lord smiled and said, *\"Those who see do not recognize; those who recognize do not see.\"* With that, he cast the comb into the river below, where it transformed into a blue dragon and soared into the sky. Both the Perfected Lord and the old woman vanished from sight.\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"A filthy comb, a thousand coins—luring the crowd,\nFor months, none grasped the hidden vow.\nOnly when hair flowed did they covet its grace,\nAs the dragon vanished into the cloud’s embrace.\"*\n\n**The Seventieth Transformation: Breaking Protocol While Drunk**\n\nThe Perfected Lord wandered through the market of Baling, where Prefect Chen Fu emerged with his procession. The Perfected Lord, violating protocol, refused to yield and was seized by the guards. The prefect had him thrown into prison and ordered him to write a confession. By dusk, he had not written a single word. The jailer pressed him, but the Perfected Lord replied, *\"Wait until I sober up.\"* The jailer scoffed, *\"How can you not fear punishment and seek solace in wine?\"* Before he could finish speaking, the Perfected Lord vanished, leaving behind only a slip of paper that read:\n\n*\"A fleeting farewell to Penglai’s sea-bound shore,\nBy chance I met the prefect—what was this for?\nBeneath the Northern Dipper’s bowl I dwell,\nMy sword hangs by the Southern Winnower’s horn so well.\nWhen I am drunk, I am truly drunk,\nWhat sorrow is, I know not—what’s its brink?\nWhy meet yet fail to recognize my face?\nI ride the white clouds home, leaving no trace.\"*\n\nThe prefect exclaimed, *\"This is Lord Lü!\"* At dawn, he burned incense and begged forgiveness. One day, he saw the Perfected Lord locked in a water basin. He hastily summoned a painter to capture his likeness, which bore a striking resemblance to Teng Zijing.\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"Blending with the world, he roams in joy,\nBound yet unbound—no need to employ.\nThe fiery official’s wrath he transcends,\nIn wisdom’s sea, the source he comprehends.\nWithin his gourd, true bliss resides,\nNo sorrow clouds his heart’s bright tides.\nThe prefect, awakened, should swiftly retire,\nLest his worldly ties ignite desire.\"*\n\n**The Seventy-First Transformation: Delivering Shi Jianwu**\n\nShi Jianwu, styled Xisheng, hailed from Putian. In the Tang dynasty, there was another Jianwu—Liu Zhenzi—just as there were two Iron Crutches Li and three Horses of Nature. From youth, he studied Buddhism, mastered the classics and histories, and excelled in literary composition.\n\nHaving embraced the Dao, he withdrew to seclude himself on West Mountain in Yuzhang, where the Perfected Lord instructed him in the method of inverting the Five Phases and the principle of revolving the Three Fields. Some say that *The Anthology of Zhong-Lü’s Transmission of the Dao* and *The Record of Gathered Perfection* were both compiled by him. On the day of his attainment, he composed a poem:\n\n*\"Layer upon layer, the dark Dao coalesces into spirit,\nJade towers and golden halls renew with each day.\nShould you recall those who studied the Dao on West Mountain,\nCount me, and we are thirteen in all.\"*\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"Transmitting the Dao, the anthology weaves wonders and confounds gods,\nThe West Mountain record reforms virtue, ever renewed.\nIf these two books truly speak the master’s words,\nHow many souls they’ve led astray with their delusions!\"*\n\n**The Seventy-Second Transformation: Delivering Liu the Lame Immortal**\n\nLiu the Lame Immortal of Changsha encountered the Perfected Lord on Jun Mountain, where he was taught the method of the Black Tortoise’s Breath. Upon completing his practice, he retired to seclude himself on Mount Lu, styling himself Master of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers. He often attended the Perfected Lord, traveling to and from the Yellow Grotto and frequently visiting beneath the city walls. He left a poem:\n\n*\"Of the seventy-two peaks of South Mountain,\nI love only the ruins within the grotto.\"*\n\nLater, there was one Zheng Yu who met the Lame Immortal outside Qingtai Gate, and together they ascended as immortals.\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"Liu the Lame Immortal’s practice ran deep,\nHis sincerity moved the immortal master to enlighten his heart.\nThe Black Tortoise’s Breath, subtle and unbroken,\nForm and spirit merged, resounding with the rarest tones.\"*\n\n**The Seventy-Third Transformation: Delivering Scholar Chen**\n\nChen Fei, a presented scholar from Min.\n\nChen arrived from Mount Luofu to wander Mount Heng, where he soon encountered the Perfected Lord and accompanied him for over ten days. Chen, reverently bowing, inquired of the Dao. The Perfected Lord said: *\"Joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure—before their arousal, this is called the Center. What do you take as the Center?\"* Chen remained silent and wrote a circle (○). The Perfected Lord said: *\"This is the principle of nature.\"* *\"What is Heaven’s Mandate?\"* Chen bowed again, and the Perfected Lord silently imparted it to him. Thereupon, he attained the Dao. Later, he visited Li Guan of Yichun and recounted the full story of how Lü Dongbin had delivered the Old Tree Immortal. Now he dwells in seclusion at Yongkang Army in Mount Heng.\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"The ice of examination degrees melted, books cast aside,\nSuddenly forgetting ‘this’ and ‘that,’ ‘also’ and ‘yet.’\nIn emptiness, the perfect Dao reveals Heaven’s Mandate,\nA single spark of numinous truth embodies the Great Void.\"*\n\n**The Seventy-Fourth Transformation: Delivering Merchant Ni**\n\nA certain Ni had newly opened a wineshop when a Daoist arrived and demanded wine. From dawn till dusk, he drank fine brew by the *shi* and more. The crowd marveled and gathered to watch. Ni demanded payment, but the Daoist only glared in silence before collapsing in drunkenness. Ni sat guard over him. At the first drum of dawn, the Daoist suddenly rose, seized a brush, and inscribed a poem on the wall:\n\n*\"Like a whale’s gulp or a turtle’s swallow—hundreds of cups,\nWho raises the jade mountain, who topples it?\nSober, the wind of heaven chimes in both sleeves,\nA crimson cloud drifts in from the sea.\"*\n\nAt the end, he wrote: *\"Composed by Wangshan Daoist Yang Chun.\"* Then, taking a clod of earth, he hurled it at Ni’s face. He strode out the door, gazed northeast, and a crimson cloud drifted toward him. Clapping his hands and laughing loudly, he vanished in an instant. When they scraped the wall, the ink had soaked through several *fen*. The clod of earth was pure gold. From then on, the wineshop thrived, and they knew Yang Chun was none other than Pure Yang.\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"To deliver Ni, he toyed with winecups,\nStraightforward: ‘Who rises, who falls?’\nThough gold struck his face, he remained deluded—\nHow might he turn his light to see his original nature?\"*\n\n**The Seventy-Fifth Transformation: Deluding Yang Liujin**\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Huizong, a Daoist calling himself Chang Xuzhong frequented the various jade palaces. His conduct was strange, his movements uncanny. He drank wine without limit, devoured raw fish and meat by the tens of *jin*, and downed icy water by the tens of *hu*. Once, when snow blanketed the ground six or seven *chi* deep, he buried himself in it for ten days without emerging, only to rise again when the snow cleared. He walked across deep pools as if treading level ground. Skilled in cursive script, he wrote in the style of withered vines and wandering silk, thousands of characters flowing unbroken in a single stroke. People vied to bring him paper, but he often refused.\n\nAt the time, there was a courtesan named Yang Liujin, a beauty of the capital. The Daoist frequented her home, warning and admonishing her, yet Yang remained unmoved. He repeatedly offered her gold and silk, but she never yielded to his advances.\n\nOne evening, Yang, emboldened by drink, approached the Daoist. The Daoist said: \"I have long since achieved the union of *kan* and *li* within my body, the inner harmony of husband and wife. The sacred embryo has taken form, and the infant and elder brother give rise to one another. How could I still cling to external beauty? The joy of inner union far surpasses that of the outer world.\" Yang, bewildered, found his words strange and incomprehensible.\n\nAt the time, the grand councilor Zhang Tianjue and the court guest Xiao, both long familiar with Yang, were told of this by her. Xiao relayed it to Zhang, who hastened to seek out the Daoist. The Daoist cried out loudly and fled, making straight for the Cloud Hall of Binyun Hermitage, where he vanished. After a long search, they found no trace of him—only a poem left upon the wall:\n\n*With one breath, the phoenix flute rends the Great Clarity,\nGreen-robed youths chant the steps of emptiness.\nFrom the jade tower, a call awakens a thousand-year dream,\nUpon the jade peach branch, the golden parrot sings.*\n\nZhang said: \"His courtesy name is Xu Zhong—this is Lord Lü.\" Later, the hermitage was consumed by fire, leaving no remnant, yet the poem alone remained untouched, a singular marvel.\n\nAnother poem reads:\n*Unmoved by cold or heat, his body light and pure,\nHe admonished the fair one to forsake form and sound.\nYet the inner yin and yang he could not make her grasp—\nIn vain the red-crowned crane cries in the Nine Marshes.*\n\n**The Seventy-Sixth Transformation: Releasing Life at Mount Lu**\nDuring the Chongning era, a traveler sailing the sea was blown off course by a fierce wind to an island, where he beheld a cave paradise. Above the golden gates hung a plaque of jade inscribed: *Celestial Immortals’ Abode*. An old man stood at the entrance, and the traveler bowed and asked: \"What blessed realm is this?\" The old man replied: \"This is a cave heaven, a place cut off from the mortal world. Only Lü Dongbin comes here from time to time to wander and play.\"\n\nThe traveler inquired after his name, and the old man said: \"I am Pei Xiu of the Tang.\" The traveler mentioned that he had heard of a missing text at Mount Lu. Upon investigating, the locals all spoke of a Daoist who, seeing a tavern owner slicing live fish for a stew, could not bear it. He transformed the man to release the fish, but the owner refused, saying: \"I will make this fish live again.\" The cook did not believe him, so the Daoist placed a single pill into the fish’s belly—whereupon it leapt and writhed. The onlookers were astonished, and the fish was set free into the river, where it circled joyfully before swimming away. The Daoist vanished, leaving only two characters written in the sand: *Return, traveler.*\n\nThe seafarer realized that the day he had been in the cave heaven was the same as the day of the fish’s release. Thus, he abandoned his home and entered the Dao.\n\nAnother poem:\n*A seafarer’s boat, blown to a cave heaven—\nClearly, from a past life, he had immortal ties.\nHearing of the fish’s death, he awakened at last—\nWhy not, in that cave heaven, bow and become a transcendent?*\n\n**The Seventy-Seventh Transformation: Admonishing the Judicial Commissioner**\nThe Perfected Lord wandered to Jiangxia, disguising himself as Lü Yuangui. He frequented the home of a local named Yang, foretelling fortunes with divine accuracy and urging the people to awaken to the Dao. One day, he suddenly took his leave, saying: \"An evil man is coming—I must avoid him.\"\n\nThat very day, the judicial commissioner Yu, on his circuit to inspect prisons, arrived in Ezhou and sought out Lord Lü, but he was nowhere to be found. Instead, they found his old acquaintance, Cen Wenxiu. When questioned, Cen insisted he knew nothing. Yu tempted him with sensual pleasures and threatened punishment, but Cen’s answers remained unchanged. Yu ordered a search of his home, where they found a long poem left behind by the Daoist, titled *On the Secrets of the Elixir*. Upon reading it, Yu realized: \"This is Lord Lü! ‘Yuangui’ was merely a splitting of the characters of ‘Mr. Lü.’ The ‘evil man’ he spoke of was me, pressing him so.\"\n\nAnother poem:\n*Coming and going to Yang’s home, he urged men to reform,\nSeeking especially to awaken the judicial commissioner.\nBy chance, he saw through Yu’s deceitful heart—\nSweeping his sleeves, he returned to the Jade Capital.*\n\n**The Seventy-Eighth Transformation: Delivering Yao Daozhen**\nIn Hezhou, there lived a man named Yao Daozhen, who in his youth served as a boatman on the Three Gorges. The Perfected Lord sent him to carry medicine sacks, traveling between Jing and Xiang for a full year. One day, while Dongbin was wandering Lake Dongting, he sat upon the water and beckoned to Daozhen. Trembling, Daozhen dared not approach, but the Perfected Lord prodded him with his staff and said: \"Is your allotted time not yet up for transcendence?\"\n\nThen he handed him twelve pills, each the size of a millet grain, saying: \"When Jupiter completes its cycle, take one pill. After finishing them, you will not die. From then on, whenever you pass a dragon’s lair, you will transform again—only beware of the Clear River.\" From that time, Daozhen ceased eating, sometimes sleeping for ten days before awakening. In scorching heat, he bundled himself in heavy furs; in the depths of winter, he lay naked upon the ice.\n\nLater, he arrived at Tongchuan and settled in a place called Longfu Town. In the fourth year of the Zhongning era, a man from the prefecture named He Shi, afflicted with madness, forcibly brought Daozhen to his home. There was a body of water named Clear River near Shi’s residence, and Daozhen, having forgotten the Perfected Lord’s warning, unwittingly crossed it three times. When Shi came to welcome him, his procession was excessively grand. The prefectural governor, Shi, saw this and took them for sorcerers. Daozhen and Shi were thrown into prison, where Daozhen said: \"I forgot the Perfected One’s words—this is my just deserts. What regret can there be?\" He then prostrated himself upon the ground and, after seven days, departed his body in liberation.\n\n*Verse:*\nServing the master, again and again completing three cycles,\nGrinding away the dust of the world—yet still not at rest.\nOne death, and in an instant, the previous step is forgotten,\nAs the immortal master beckons him to Yingzhou.\n\n**Inscription for the Seventy-Ninth Transformation**\nThe Perfected Lord traveled to Tianqing Abbey in Qinzhou. At that time, all the Daoist clergy had gone to a neighboring prefecture for a jiao offering, leaving only a young acolyte behind. The Perfected Lord asked for a brush to write, but the boy declined, saying the abbey had just been renovated and the master had forbidden defacing the walls. The Perfected Lord then said: \"Then trouble yourself to tend the incense burner in the Hall of Fire. I wish to pay homage to the Three Clarities.\" When he entered, he saw the clear, rippling water of a pond behind the hall. With a melon rind, he inscribed upon the wall:\n\n*A stone pool of limpid water—this is my heart,*\n*Steeping those peach blossoms in its inverted depths.*\n*Once within the empty precincts of Bangshan,*\n*Freed from worldly burdens, I play the seven-stringed zither.*\n\nAt the end, he wrote: *\"Huihou Yangshu.\"* The wall was exceedingly high, beyond the reach of any hand. When the others returned and marveled at it, they realized that *Hui* was Lü [Dongbin], and *Hou Yang* was the reverse of his name.\n\n*Verse:*\nSerene and luminous, the void is the heart of the Dao,\nThe primal essence rises and sets like sun and moon.\nIn this pure hall, who is the true kindred spirit?\nStrumming the zither’s empty strings in a single melody.\n\n**The Eightieth Transformation: Zhang Zhennu**\nZhang Zhennu was a courtesan from Wuxing, of a simple and unadorned nature. Though fallen into the wind and dust of the world, each evening she bathed and changed her clothes, lighting incense at the hearth to pray to Heaven, fervently seeking deliverance. During the Xuanhe era, a scholar visited her. Zhennu, seeing his refined and extraordinary bearing, treated him with particular reverence. She prepared wine, and they parted after a joyous evening. The next day, he returned, and thus they continued for over a month, yet he never once crossed the bounds of propriety.\n\nZhang, astonished, asked him, \"You have graced me with your favor for so long—why never stay the night to enjoy the pleasures of the pillow and mat? Is your handmaid too coarse and unworthy to serve you?\"\n\nThe scholar replied, \"Not so. When people find affinity, what matters is the meeting of hearts—why must it be thus?\" Another day, midway through their wine, he asked Zhennu, \"What else do you do in your daily life?\"\n\nShe answered, \"Having lost myself to this life, what else can I do? Each evening, I pray only to settle this debt.\"\n\nThe scholar said, \"Then why not study the Dao?\"\n\nShe replied, \"Pressed by the needs of body and mouth, how could I find time for such things? And where would I find a teacher?\"\n\nThe scholar said, \"Could I be your teacher?\"\n\nShe answered, \"If that is so, then I would be most fortunate.\" She immediately rose, straightened her clothes, lit incense at the hearth, and bowed to him.\n\nAfter he left, a full ten days passed without his return. Zhang, alone, idly wrote:\n\n*Met my teacher all this time,\nYet not a word was spoken.\nNow that he’s gone,\nMy heart is heavy with longing.*\n\nShe had barely set down her brush when the scholar suddenly arrived. Seeing what she had written, he laughed and asked, \"What is this?\" Zhang tried to hide it, but the scholar said, \"Why not show me?\" When she did, he added to it:\n\n*No need for cleverness or skill,\nI’ll give you a method simple and true.\nFrom midnight to noon, sit in stillness,\nThrough the twin passes of the spine,\nPast Kunlun’s weary slope.\nConserve your strength,\nAnd think of me.*\n\nZhang Zhennu rejoiced greatly and bowed in deep gratitude. From then on, her spirit felt unbound, as if awakened. He also imparted secret teachings to her, which she never revealed to others. Yet she still did not know who he truly was.\n\nMonths later, he came to bid her farewell. Zhang prepared a feast to send him off. At the parting, he handed her a sealed letter, saying, \"Open this after I have gone.\" When she broke the seal, she found a lyric to the tune of *Stepping into the Moon Palace*:\n\n*Kan and Li, Qian and Dui divide at midnight and noon,\nYou must recognize your own ancestral root.\nThe thunder shakes the earth, rain falls on the mountain’s crest—\nTo wash and nurture the yellow sprout as it breaks the soil.\nSeize the golden essence, bind it fast,\nDistinguish jia and geng to subdue dragon and tiger.\nWhen others ask who transmitted this to you,\nSay only that the master’s surname was Lü.*\n\nZhang then purified herself, bid farewell to her guests and friends, painted his portrait, and served it with devotion. Practicing his instructions, after a year, she departed through *shijie*. The accompanying poetic imagery reads:\n\n*Yang returns to Qian,\nPure yin’s filth at noon—an image of the primal lord.\nThis is our original ancestor, a single qi,\nMisty and descending as sweet rain.\nSuddenly vast and floating,\nThe black soil’s primordial extremity.\nWithin, sincerity is tightly sealed,\nJade dragon coiled, darkly imprisoned gold tiger.\nThe master lightly strikes the stringless zither,\nNo longer bound to the official tones of gong, shang, or lü.*\n\n*The Wondrous Record of the Divine Transformations of the Imperial Lord of Pure Yang, Scroll Five, concludes.*\n\n*The Wondrous Record of the Divine Transformations of the Imperial Lord of Pure Yang, Scroll Six*\n*Collated and Compiled by Miao Shanshi of the Mysterious Gate*\n\n**The Eighty-First Transformation: Enlightening Liu Gaoshang**\n\nLiu Gaoshang was of a naturally pure and sincere disposition, his nature gentle and kind. He held no love for wealth or honor, promptly abandoning his riches and property. He severed worldly attachments and transcended the mundane, refusing to serve kings or nobles, for his aspirations soared high. Forsaking Confucian studies for the Dao, he retreated into forests and springs. Roaming beyond the world’s bounds, he first encountered an immortal who said to him: *\"A broken inner hinge mends, a shattered jar is made whole—cultivating the true is just like this.\"*\n\nLater, he met the Imperial Lord, and their words resonated deeply. Gaoshang asked: *\"The heart of the Dao is subtle—may I perceive it?\"* The Lord replied: *\"It lies beyond the reach of ear or eye, known only through silent communion of the spirit.\"*\n\nGaoshang inquired: *\"What is meant by ‘holding fast to the center’?\"* The Lord answered: *\"Where the seven emotions have yet to arise, where the six desires do not stir—what is that?\"* He further asked: *\"What is its form?\"* The Imperial Lord fell silent, gazing into the void as he traced a single character in the air.\n\nGaoshang bowed and said: *\"The myriad principles return to the origin, the one nature is the great void—I am no longer in doubt.\"* The Imperial Lord then asked: *\"Do you understand the true emptiness of the wisdom-life?\"* Gaoshang bowed again, entreating instruction. The Lord secretly transmitted an oral formula and departed.\n\nLater, in Anding Township of Bohai County, Gaoshang built a hut and dwelled in a garden for over twenty years, perfecting his cultivation and spreading the Dao’s teachings far and wide. Emperor Huizong summoned him thrice before he finally appeared at court, where he expounded only the principles of purity and naturalness as the foundation of governance. When the emperor inquired about the wonders of refining the golden elixir, Gaoshang replied: *\"Your Majesty governs myriad affairs—this matter lies beyond the world and need not trouble your sagely concern.\"* The emperor, silently pleased, bestowed upon him the title *Master of Subtle Wonder*.\n\nLater, he wandered to Mount Luofu, establishing a Daoist sanctuary, and manifested his transformations at the Hidden Truth Abbey in Suzhou, leaving behind stele inscriptions. He composed the *Returning to the Origin* for the world, often instructing his disciples: *\"When spirit congeals and qi gathers, the elixir forms in stillness. The heart harbors no delusive thoughts, the mind does not stray outward. Let the heart die utterly—there is no need for external seeking. The three realms undergo spiritual transformation.\"*\n\n**Poetic Imagery:**\n*A shattered jar’s hinge mends—leaks may be sealed through subtle cultivation.\nThe seven emotions arise from no-cause, the nature is clear, the wisdom-life incomplete.\nReceiving the master’s secret transmission, joy unbounded—\nRoaming the Central Plain, hidden in a garden.\nPlayfully wandering Luofu and Suzhou,\nWithin the hall, brush and ink stand as companions.\nA hundred thousand myriad wondrous transformations—\nThe imperial capital thrice summons the counselor.\nPure and tranquil, his virtuous plan fulfilled,\nHis journey complete, he rides his sword to Penglai.*\n\n---\n\n**The Eighty-Second Transformation: Exorcising the Palace Haunting**\n\nDuring the Zhenghe era, a malevolent spirit appeared in the imperial palace by day, stealing gold and jewels, violating the consorts and concubines—yet the emperor’s own chambers remained untouched. Though Lin Lingsu, Wang Wenqing, and other court Daoists attempted to suppress it, the haunting ceased only to return. The emperor fasted and prayed devoutly, presenting petitions to the Nine Heavens.\n\nOne afternoon as the emperor dozed, he saw beyond the eastern gate a Daoist priest wearing a kingfisher-blue lotus coronet and a purple crane-feather cloak, holding a crystal ruyi scepter. The priest bowed and said, “Your servant has received the Supreme Emperor’s edict to suppress the haunting.” After a while, a warrior in golden armor seized the specter, split it open, and devoured it nearly whole. The emperor asked who the warrior was, and the Daoist replied, “He is Lord Guan Yu, the Perfected Lord of Sagely Tranquility whom Your Majesty has enfeoffed.” The emperor repeatedly expressed his gratitude, then asked where Zhang Fei was. Guan Yu answered, “Fei is my brother through many kalpas. Now he has been reborn to Your Majesty in the household of the Yue family in Xiangzhou. In the future, he will assist in the restoration of the dynasty, and Fei will render great service.” The emperor asked the Daoist’s name, and he replied, “My surname is Yang, and I was born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month. Your Majesty’s nature inclines toward the strange and marvelous, and your mind is not upright, which has allowed evil to invade the palace. You must rectify your mind and cultivate purity and tranquility to govern and transform the realm, thereby averting future incursions by treacherous thieves.” The emperor did not comprehend, and the Daoist vanished, leaving the emperor to believe he was Lü Dongbin.\n\nFrom that time onward, the palace hauntings ceased entirely. The emperor then decreed that all places where Lü Dongbin was venerated with incense should be officially designated as sites of the “Wondrous Daoist Transformations of the Perfected Spirit.” He also commissioned a statue of Lü to be enshrined in the Jingling Palace, where seasonal sacrifices were offered. A poetic reflection follows:\n\nThe Son of Heaven, the Celestial Origin flourishes,\nIn pure sincerity, he holds fast to the center.\nWhen sincerity and the center are not obscured,\nAbove and below, all is harmonious and free.\nTreacherous flatterers retreat into hiding,\nDark malevolence severs its shadowy threads.\nThe loyal and good uphold the true transformation,\nWhile demons and monsters lose their numinous power.\nIn purity and tranquility, yin and yang are balanced,\nPeace and harmony bring abundance to all beings.\nWeapons and warfare are stilled,\nAnd the world delights in the wind of benevolence.\n\n**The Eighty-Third Transformation: Playfully Wandering Luofu**\n\nThe Perfected Lord wandered to the Zhuming Abbey on Mount Luofu. Arriving at a small courtyard, he found the Daoist master away and only a young novice present. The novice bowed to the Perfected Lord and said, “Master, please sit here for a moment.” He then secretly took the Daoist’s wine and offered it to the Perfected Lord, who drank his fill. The Perfected Lord then instructed the novice to finish the rest, but the novice refused. The novice suffered from a cataract in his left eye, so the Perfected Lord chanted over the remaining wine and applied it to the novice’s eye. Suddenly, the eye cleared, as if it had never been afflicted. The Perfected Lord then took up a brush and painted a landscape on the wall, depicting three ponds at the foot of a mountain. He said, “If you drink my wine, you will attain immortality. If you do not, it is your fate—yet you will still enjoy long life.” With these words, he flew into the stone wall and vanished.\n\nWhen the Daoist master returned and saw the mountain painting extending through the wall inside and out, he was astonished and exclaimed, “The three ponds at the mountain’s base form the character *kun*—was this not Master Lü?” Later, the novice indeed lived to the age of one hundred and fifty before passing away. A poetic reflection follows:\n\nWith carefree steps, he wanders the seas and peaks,\nTurning, he suddenly arrives at Luofu.\nThe Daoist eye opens, dispelling darkness,\nMountains and waters conceal his name, returning to the Great Void.\n\n**The Eighty-Fourth Transformation: Admonishing the Monk of Changsha**\n\nThe Perfected Lord wandered to Changsha, disguising himself as a returning Daoist.\n\nHolding a small clay jar, he begged for coins, and though he received countless, the jar never filled—people all marveled at this wonder. One day, seated by the roadside in the market, he declared, “Whoever can fill my jar with coins shall be taught the Dao.” The crowd vied to toss coins into the jar, yet it remained unfilled. A monk, pushing a cart laden with coins, jested, “Can your jar hold this?” The Daoist replied, “Indeed.” He then bade the monk push the cart into the jar. A deep, resonant sound arose, and in an instant, the cart vanished. The monk exclaimed, “Are you a divine immortal or a master of illusion?” The Daoist extemporized a poem:\n\nNeither god nor immortal,\nNeither illusion nor trick.\nHeaven and earth have their end,\nMulberry fields shift and change.\nThis body is not your true self—\nWhy cling to it so?\nWhy not follow me,\nRiding a whale through boundless skies?\n\nThe monk grew ever more astonished and suspicious, wishing to kill him. The Daoist said, “Do you grieve for these coins? I shall repay you now.” He took a slip of paper, cast it into the jar, and intoned, “Hasten to push the cart out.” After a long while, nothing emerged. The Daoist said, “Only I can retrieve it myself.” With that, he leapt into the jar and vanished. The monk shattered the jar, finding only a slip of paper inscribed with a poem:\n\nTo seek the true, first know the true,\nYet seeing it, you fail to wake.\nWe’ll meet again with a laugh,\nDriving your cart on the eastern road.\n\nThe monk returned in dejection. On the eastern road, he suddenly saw the Daoist and said, “I have awaited you. Your attachment to the debt is repaid—seeking the Dao thus will not do.” The monk began to repent and apologize, but the Daoist was already gone. A collective verse follows:\n\nAll dharmas are not true,\nThis body is but illusion.\nFame and fortune are like water bubbles,\nWorldly affairs shift like clouds.\nGold and jade do not endure,\nRank and eminence are not worth longing for.\nHow many monks still crave wealth,\nDeepening the vast sea of suffering?\nIllusions delude and bind,\nThe true source remains obscured.\nNot knowing the luminous nature of heaven,\nThey лишь tread the paths of the mind.\n\n**The Eighty-Fifth Transformation: Warning Lou Daoming**\n\nLou Daoming of Zitong was wealthy and skilled in the arts of the Plain Girl. He kept young maidens, selecting only those of exceptional beauty, plumpness, and flawless complexion—never fewer than ten. Yet he was generous in aiding the poor and often performed hidden acts of kindness. His spirit was clear, his body robust, his face like a peach blossom. Sometimes he went months without eating, and at ninety-seven, he appeared no older than fifty. He was particularly fond of boasting and exaggeration. When entertaining guests, he might claim the Plain Girl had sent him fruit or that Peng Zu and Rong Cheng had bequeathed him writings, insisting he was a true immortal.\n\nOne day, the Lord Emperor disguised himself as a beggar and came to his door. Lou, failing to recognize him, shouted at him to leave. The Lord Emperor pressed his two feet upon a stone basin, instantly carving two square holes, each three inches deep. Lou, astonished, invited him to sit beside him, saying, “You are no beggar.” He summoned his maidservants to sing *The Immortal’s Journey* and offered wine. The Lord Emperor improvised a *Wang Jiangnan* lyric to intoxicate him:\n\n*Above the Jasper Pool,*\n*Auspicious mists embrace the immortals.*\n*Silken-clad golden youths strike phoenix chimes,*\n*Green-robed maidens play simurgh pipes.*\n*Here in the Great Brahma Heaven,*\n*Drunk in the ethereal Jade Capital Mountain.*\n*The steps of emptiness sung to their end,*\n*Who knows what year this night may be?*\n*Seas turn to mulberry fields once more.*\n\nThe maidservants brought Sichuan paper for him to write upon. He wrote from the bottom of the page to the top, filling every space without leaving a gap. Lou was greatly shocked and joyfully begged for the essentials of the Dao. The Lord Emperor replied, “I transmit it by word of mouth.” Lou pressed further, and again he said, “I transmit it by word of mouth.” Suddenly, he ascended to the treetop of a large parasol tree outside the door and vanished.\n\nA few days later, Lou suddenly fell ill, vomiting a silver-like viscous fluid by the bucketful before dying. The “word of mouth” transmission and the two square holes in the stone were both allusions to the character *Lü*.\n\n**Verse:**\nMaster Lou was sturdy and vigorous, his nature kind and benevolent.\nYet his heart strayed from the true path—his claims of wine, fruit, and bequeathed writings were all demonic illusions.\nStill, his many hidden virtues moved the Patriarch to warn and save him.\nAlas, Daoming failed to awaken!\nThe lofty scholar’s will, the true immortal’s essence—\nCultivating vast emptiness, he blows the jade flute,\nAbsorbing the celestial music of the jade pipes.\nPurifying the radiant heart,\nFar from the sea of desire,\nHe overturns the mountain of the self.\nExploring the mysteries of the Dark and Plain,\nLou clung to perverse defenses, mistaking them for the Dao—\nCease this harm to the cinnabar field!\n\n---\n\n**The Eighty-Sixth Transformation: The Crane Assembly at Mount Qingcheng**\n\nAt the end of the Shaoxing era, the Lord Emperor attended the Crane Assembly at Mount Qingcheng and rested at the home of a pastry vendor. The man did not recognize him and, when the Lord Emperor drunkenly vomited into a basin of rancid dough, showed no displeasure. Instead, a strange fragrance filled the room, and the people marveled. Lü Dongbin dipped his brush in thick ink and wrote a poem on the door’s great wooden panel:\n\n*Only fear the needle’s departure from the heart,*\n*True bronze transmuted into gold.*\n*The temples’ once-white hair*\n*Gallops away like a steed, hard to find.*\n\nHe signed it: *Lü Dongbin was here.* The brushwork was vigorous, its luster extraordinary, drawing a crowd. Some tried to carve it away, but the ink had already penetrated the wood’s reverse, growing even more vivid. At that time, a scholar named Guan Yunxiang saw it and recognized the figure in the poem as a gaunt Daoist.\n\nAfterward, the pastry vendor’s family held a grand feast in honor of the oil cakes.\n\n**Verse:**\nAt the Crane Assembly on Qingcheng, the golden needle was bestowed,\nSpilling forth entrails turned to gold across the earth.\nHow many blind mortals fail to awaken,\nAs clouds drift away, untraceable?\n\n---\n\n**The Eighty-Seventh Transformation: Delivering Cao Sanxiang**\n\nIn Anfeng County, the courtesan Cao Sanxiang contracted a loathsome disease. As she lodged travelers at her inn, the Lord Emperor disguised himself as a poor scholar seeking shelter. Her servant, seeing his shabby clothes, refused him, but Sanxiang said, “Since I stand at this gate, why distinguish between clean and filthy?” She welcomed him in and treated him with great courtesy.\n\nBefore long, Cao’s illness flared, and she suffered terribly. The Lord Emperor bound her thigh with a sinew and said, “Turn your heart, turn your heart.” Outside the door stood a long-dead soapberry tree. He applied medicine to it, and the next day, the tree revived, its branches and leaves lush and thriving. Only then did Cao realize he was a true immortal—and that the two “turn your heart” exhortations were an allusion to *Lü*. She immediately destroyed her cosmetics, abandoned her home, and traveled far away to serve in the shrine of the True Man Lü.\n\nAt the end of the Shaoxing era, Cao suddenly returned to her hometown, her appearance refined and radiant. No one recognized her. She recounted her story, then departed, never to be seen again.\n\n**Verse:**\nEvery person may become an immortal,\nIf only they turn their heart—then the path appears.\nMoved by Sanxiang’s hidden virtues,\nFrom the mire, she rose to the azure heavens.\n\n---\n\n**The Eighty-Eighth Transformation: The Jeweled Wheel’s Manifestation**\n\nDuring the Shaoxing era, the county magistrate Hu Zhen was fond of Daoist arts. He held a grand ritual at the Baolu Palace in the capital, where many masters of esoteric techniques gathered. The Lord Emperor, concealing his name, lodged among them and boasted of his extraordinary abilities. Taking a small amount of medicine in his palm, he blew on it several times. Suddenly, a red glow spread, forming a jeweled wheel in which the characters *Dongbin* appeared. The crowd was astonished, but when they searched for him, he had vanished.\n\n**Verse:**\nHeaven’s Dao is not mere technique—\nThose who claim it as such blind their eyes.\nWithin the jeweled wheel, the celestial true nature is revealed,\nSilently attaining perfect clarity and the supreme vehicle.\n\n---\n\n**The Eighty-Ninth Transformation: The Medicine That Saved Daoist Fu**\n\nDaoist Fu of Jiangling was pure and kind, daily revering the image of Lü Dongbin with utmost devotion. On New Year’s Day during the Qiandao era, he sat alone in his shop when a guest in a square cap and cloth robe entered. They spoke for a long time, then the guest rose and said, “I have a hundred coins—would you accompany me to a tavern for a drink?” Fu agreed. From then on, the guest visited every ten days, sometimes staying to drink, sometimes inviting Fu to join him.\n\nAt the time, Fu’s eyes were dim and often teary. The guest taught him to take raw and prepared *dihuang* (rehmannia), slice and dry them, then mix equal parts with Sichuan peppercorns (removing the stems, seeds, and closed pods) and lightly stir-fry the three ingredients.\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nGrind the ingredients into powder, blend with honey, and form into pills. Take fifty pills on an empty stomach with rice water. Fu followed the method and could see clearly at night. Later, he suddenly saw a true image resembling the guest—a stone statue of the Lü Dongbin he had revered.\n\n*Poetic Image:*\nWhen drinking together, the heart was already revealed,\nThe Dao-nature opened, and perfect clarity was attained.\nFu’s blessings were shallow, you might think,\nYet the medicine saved his dim and clouded eyes.\n\n**The Longxi Beggar’s Meal (Ninetieth Transformation)**\nIn Longxi County of Fuzhou, an old woman ran a roadside eatery and often offered meals to passing Buddhist monks and Daoist priests. During the Qiandao era, a Daoist came to beg for food. The old woman welcomed him warmly. When she asked his name, he did not answer. After eating, he used the charred end of a firewood stick to write on the wall: *\"Lü Dongbin came here\"*—the characters shone with an extraordinary radiance. From then on, her eatery thrived with customers.\n\nThe prefect heard of this and rode out to see it for himself, but the writing had already faded without a trace. The prefect sighed in awe and returned, convinced of the divine brush.\n\n*Poetic Verse:*\nIdly playing in Longxi, transforming a single meal,\nThe old woman kindly served, never asking whence he came.\nThe writing on the wall pointed directly to the enlightened Way—\nThe prefect, unaware, vainly hoped for more.\n\n**Warning to Commander Zhao (Ninety-First Transformation)**\nIn Tanzhou, Military Commander Zhao Buwen held a Crane Gathering on the fourteenth day of the fourth month in the ninth year of the Chunxi era. A Daoist, appearing from nowhere, lifted his robe and entered the feast hall without bowing to anyone, then vanished into an inner chamber. All that remained was a sheet of paper on the table, inscribed with a quatrain:\n\n*From this meeting, no lack of affinity,*\n*The courtyard’s splendor is a small grotto-heaven.*\n*A sword soars into the sky and flies away,*\n*Startling the old dragon of Dongting from its slumber.*\n\nAt the end was written: *\"Written by the Valley Guest.\"*\n\n*Poetic Verse:*\nEach post, with kindness, weaves the threads of Dao,\nThe immortals descend, moved by sincerity.\nLifting his robe without a bow—true tidings,\nAwakening to the body’s sleep while the spirit remains awake.\n\n**Demanding Wine in Shaozhou (Ninety-Second Transformation)**\nOutside Shaozhou city, an old woman ran a tavern. Every morning, she reverently offered three cups of wine to the True Man Lü. One day, a Daoist named Lü came to ask for wine, but she had none left. She gave him a *sheng* of murky lees instead. The Daoist asked the price, and she said, \"Twenty coins per *sheng*.\" He pointed at the wine, wrote twenty characters on a purple stone outside the door, and placed two copper coins beside them—then vanished. Upon closer inspection, the writing and coins had pierced through the stone, sinking several *chi* deep. From then on, crowds gathered to see it, and her tavern prospered. The old woman passed away at ninety while sitting in meditation. Later, people built the Kangxian Hall at her former home.\n\n*Poetic Image:*\nEach morning, she poured wine for the true immortal,\nThe ritual slight, but her heart was never light.\nTwenty-two coins pierced the stone in an instant—\nA transformed heart, joyful in long life.\n\n**Healing the Illness of the Liu Family (Ninety-Third Transformation)**\nIn Yuezhou, a poor man named Liu had been lame and barely able to walk for nearly twenty years. Every day, he burned incense at his stove, praying to heaven to cure his ailment with utmost sincerity. One day, a Daoist carrying an iron gourd visited Liu and said, \"Your illness is easy to cure. Follow me.\" Liu followed him for about two *li*, where the Daoist pointed to the ground and said, \"Beneath here, three *chi* deep, lies a five-colored stone. Dig it up.\" They did so and found a stone the size of a pellet, its hues unlike any ordinary stone. The Daoist said, \"Take it home, expose it to the sun for nine days, grind it into fine powder, and drink it with a decoction of quince peel. You will be cured. Then come to the third room on the left in the east corridor of Zhuyun Hermitage outside the city to meet me again.\" Liu followed his instructions, and after finishing the medicine, he felt as light and agile as if he had never been ill. He went to the hermitage and searched the left and right walls but found no one—only an image of Lü Dongbin holding an iron gourd.\n\n*Poetic Image:*\nPoor in body, suffering in illness, yet his heart stood firm,\nTwenty years of sincere prayers to the high heavens.\nA borrowed image, a compassionate lesson—\nSuddenly cured, his steps light and free.\n\n**Prefect Zhang’s Enlightenment (Ninety-Fourth Transformation)**\nEast of Chuixing Temple in Yiyang County, Tanzhou, stood the Laizhen Hall. During the Qiandao era, the Lord Emperor had once visited and inscribed a poem on its wall. A cloth robe had brushed against him in the ninth month of autumn, leaving Prefect Zhang Diao filled with admiration. During the Chunxi era, when Zhang was magistrate of Yueyang, he ordered the restoration of the Lü Dongbin statue. That night, Lü appeared in a dream to thank him and said, \"You have kept the *Threefold Method of the Five Metal Elixirs* hidden for years. You should transmit it to later generations so that all may witness the great Dao, rather than keeping it for yourself alone.\" Upon waking, Zhang had the text printed in the prefectural study to spread its teachings widely.\n\nThe preface to the *Threefold Method* reads:\n*\"From youth, I studied Confucian teachings; in adulthood, I grew fond of the mysteries of the Dao. My aspirations turned to purity and emptiness, my heart wandered among clouds and waters. I sought teachers and visited friends, traveling without weariness.\"*\n\nEarnest inquiry and reflective thought never gave way to slackening. The ascent and descent of yin and yang follow the pattern of the Two Modes. The root of nature and life returns to the One Breath. Formless and featureless, they come as but a single man and woman. With names and surnames, they depart leaving three sons and three daughters. By the nine-tiered terrace, the Golden Lad gathers the Yellow Sprout. Before the twelve-pillared tower, the Jade Maiden harvests the White Snow. Fire arises from water, discerning the talent of the Eight Trigrams. Within yin, yang is refined, naturally distinguishing the darkness of the Nine Provinces. The Three Flowers harmonize, their fiery radiance ascending straight to the dark thoroughfare. After a thousand days of practice, the work is complete, and the phoenix and crane soar freely to the island seas.\n\nThe celestial mechanism runs deep, not to be lightly spoken of. The essential subtleties of the Dao are difficult to describe directly. Now, drawing from methods witnessed in daily practice and the verified talismans of revered masters, I have compiled eighteen oral instructions to secretly guide later learners.\n\nFor the minor accomplishment of the Golden Elixir, seven instructions:\n1. The Heavenly Lad Never Ages\n2. Gathering Fire to Boil the Sea\n3. Matching Yin and Yang\n4. Gathering Fire to Return to the Origin\n5. Dispersing Fire to Refine Form\n6. The Dragon-Tiger Golden Elixir\n7. The Fire Times of the Celestial Cycle\n\nFor the intermediate accomplishment of the Golden Elixir, six instructions:\n1. The River Chariot Behind the Elbow\n2. Flying Golden Essence Behind the Elbow\n3. The Jade Fluid Returning Elixir\n4. Refining Form with Jade Fluid\n5. The Golden Fluid Returning Elixir\n6. Refining Form with Golden Fluid\n\nFor the major accomplishment of the Golden Elixir, five instructions:\n1. Gathering Spirit to Audience the Origin\n2. Refining Breath into Form\n3. Body in Unity with the Great Void\n4. Exiting Being and Entering Non-Being\n5. Form and Spirit Transcending Liberation\n\nThe text comprises three thousand words, with each instruction in four lines of four characters each. In plain language, it reveals the obscure and primordial essence of the precelestial supreme spirit. By this measure, it stands far apart from the *Transmitted Dao and Collected Numinous Treasures Methods*.\n\n**Poetic Imagery:**\nSudden and gradual, the three accomplishments are neither easy nor hard;\nLofty and empty, the self returns to contemplation of the heart.\nThe numinous spring transforms substance, the Elixir Terrace gleams;\nThe fire of wisdom refines form, the Sea of Desire dries.\nCeasing thoughts and concentrating spirit, the full Dharma-image is preserved;\nRefining essence into breath, the youthful countenance abides.\nForm and spirit both wondrous, transcending birth and death,\nThey roam the precelestial, no ordinary affair.\n\n*Pure Yang Emperor’s Wondrous Records of Divine Transformations, Scroll Six (concluded)*\n*Pure Yang Emperor’s Wondrous Records of Divine Transformations, Scroll Seven*\n*Collated and arranged by Miao Shanshi of the Mysterious Gate, with poetic imagery*\n*Ninety-Fifth Transformation of the Venerable Kai Xian*\n\nAt Mount Lu’s Kai Xian Monastery, the monk Fazhen had sat in meditation for twenty years, his precepts and conduct exemplary. One day, as he entered samādhi, he saw a Daoist come to call and ask: “Master, do you hold that the Dao is to be realized through sitting alone?” Fazhen replied: “So I do.” The Daoist said: “The Buddha’s precepts forbid greed, anger, delusion, and killing. How is it that when you sit, you claim to have extinguished these impulses, yet when you encounter circumstances or objects, you cannot master yourself? Then these four kinds of mind scatter and surge beyond control—can the Dao reside in sitting alone?”\n\nThereupon he led Fazhen through the monks’ hall. They saw a monk fast asleep, snoring deeply. The Daoist said: “Let us sit here a while and observe this monk.” After a long time, they saw a small crimson serpent, over five inches long, emerge from the crown of the sleeping monk’s head. It slithered down the left leg of the bed to the floor, crossed over to feed on spittle and phlegm, then circled the chamber pot and drank before departing. It glided outside the veranda, crossed a small ditch, and wound around a flower terrace, pausing as if to rest. Crossing back, it encountered the Daoist, who poured a bucket of water to flood the ditch, forcing the serpent to retreat. The Daoist then planted a small blade in its path. Seeing it, the serpent shrank back, found a side route, reached the right leg of the bed, and re-entered through the crown of the monk’s head.\n\nThe monk awoke with a start and, greeting the Daoist and Fazhen, said: “I just had a dream. Let me tell you both. At first, I dreamed I exited through the left gate and encountered two fine vegetarian offerings. I ate them, then came upon fine wine and drank. Crossing a small river outside the gate, I met dozens of beautiful women and gazed at them to my heart’s content. Crossing another small river, the water suddenly rose, and I could not proceed. Turning back, I encountered a bandit who tried to kill me. I fled by a shortcut, entered through the right gate, and awoke.”\n\nThe Daoist and Fazhen laughed heartily and left, saying: “Your feet were the gates; your spittle, phlegm, and urine were the offerings and wine; the ditch was the river; the flowers and trees were the beautiful women; and the blade was the bandit. Such are the illusions of dream and delusion.”\n\nFazhen asked: “What was that serpent?” The Daoist replied: “This monk’s nature is venomous and prone to anger. His habitual tendencies have altered his form and color, and he has already taken on the appearance of a serpent. When he closes his eyes in death, he will be born among serpents. Should he not be terrified?” Then he said: “I am Lü Dongbin. Seeing your sincerity and capacity for the Dao, I have come to instruct you.”\n\nThe monk bowed in reverence and sought guidance. Later, he followed the Daoist away, and none knew his ultimate fate.\n\n*Poetic Imagery:*\nFazhen’s virtue and conduct stood apart from common men;\nOur Ancestor, in mercy, came to rescue him from dust.\nThe seed of Dao lies benighted through love and desire;\nThe Buddha-mind grows deluded over food and lust.\nThe four beginnings extinguished, the primordial lord is clear;\nOne nature, perfectly pure, reveals its original truth.\nThe sleeping monk, now awakened, at last gains insight—\nTogether they follow the Master beyond the heavens, in joy eternal.\n\n*Ninety-Sixth Transformation: Wandering Shen’s Garden*\nShen Weixin of Huzhou was kind and full of hidden virtue. His family garden was most splendid. During the Qingyuan era, a visitor in a dark blue robe and headscarf entered and wandered freely. His appearance was quite unusual. The gardener hurried to inform the master, but when they searched, the visitor had vanished. Only on the wall of the rear pavilion did they find a poem:\n\nA thousand miles I came, the road from Shu so long;\nWith staff in hand, I wander idly through a hundred-flowered estate.\nWhose home holds parrots and dogs amid a thousand households’ market?\nWithin lies a hidden isle where immortals abide.\nNestling swallows and calling turtledoves—spring at ease;\nFalling blossoms and flying catkins—water faintly gleams.\nThe master has resolved his worldly affairs;\nHere he reopens Green Wild Hall.\n\nAt the end was written: “Composed by the Daoist Xiang.” Some said *xiang* was a reversal of *hui*, meaning it must have been Lü Dongbin.\n\n*Poetic Imagery:*\nSincerity and trust—within the gourd, sun and moon stretch long;\nAmid waters and mountains, the immortal’s estate lies hidden.\nLike peril in the world revealing what is true,\nIt is best to hide deep where clouds take root.\nProfound and solid, harmonious—here the Daoist finds joy;\nVain and flashy, cunning—worldly men grow lost in mist.\nShen’s garden, lovely in every detail,\nHow could it compare to White Jade Hall on Mount Jing?\n\n*Ninety-Seventh Transformation: Deliverance of Yang Taiming*\nYang Taiming of Nankang was filial toward his parents. After their deaths, he built a hut by their graves and remained in mourning for three years before returning home. One day during his vigil, on the seventh day of the seventh month, the Pure Yang Emperor came to call and said: “You will face a calamity in the eighth month. Take my medicine, and it will pass.” He produced a small gourd, took out medicine, and gave it to Taiming, who swallowed it. Then the Emperor spread his robe over Taiming’s back and said: “Will you come with me?” Taiming assented. The Emperor placed him inside the gourd. Bewildered, Taiming was about to speak when the Emperor laughed and said: “What am I doing? I was merely testing you.” He reached into the gourd and returned Taiming to his place.\n\nPresently, the Emperor took a cup of water, dropped the medicine into it, and stirred with his hand. In an instant, the medicine gathered into a pellet the size of a bullet, its radiance dazzling. He asked Taiming: “Would you like to take it?” Taiming replied: “Perhaps later.” The Emperor then consumed it himself and said slowly: “To hesitate is already to miss the mark. You endure hardship here—do you ever think of how to provide for your daily needs? I have something to give you.” He took a clod of earth and blew on it, turning it into purple gold. Taiming, thinking the Emperor was tempting him with profit, refused to accept it. The Emperor kicked the gold, turning it back into stone.\n\nTaiming said: “All the immortals have left me poems. Can you do the same?” The Emperor immediately took up a worn brush, dipped it in a cup of water, and with three or four strokes on the ground, wrote boldly on the wall:\n\nYang is a man of true integrity,\nHis filial piety resounding through heaven and earth.\nHeaven, pitying his hardship,\nSent me on the seventh night to visit him.\nI offered medicine to transform stubborn stone,\nAnd left you wealth for generations to come.\nSince you would not accept it from me,\nI would not force it upon you.\nThe winds and dust make brief my stay—\nI hope your resolve remains unswerving.\nWhen the time comes for the Rat’s year,\nYou will see the clouds turn as easily as a palm.\n\nAt the end, he signed: “Presented by the Returning Guest,” then departed. At first, the characters seemed faint and hard to discern, but soon their color deepened to a rich red, sinking several *fen* into the wall.\n\nIn the first month of the Year of the Rat, a perfected one came and took Taiming away with him.\n\n*Poetic Imagery:*\nThe Dao’s source is one—bright or dim, heaven and earth diverge.\nHeaven and earth rise and fall;\nSun and moon come and go.\nThe world rarely sees clarity and emptiness;\nWealth and honor—men vie to enjoy them.\n\nThe immortal ancestor labored to awaken him,\nWhile Taiming strove with earnest force.\nWhen the heart is empty, the eye of nature sees clearly;\nBreath stills, the spirit becomes pure and bright.\nNot awakened—it is as if mountains stand between;\nEnlightened—it is as if the palm lies before the eye.\n\n**The Ninety-Eighth Transformation: Passing Through the Second Son of the Qiao Family**\nIn the capital, there lived a man named Qiao Erlang, whose family was wealthy and generous in ritual. He was valiant yet humble, harmonious with others, benevolent and kind to all things. He donated coffins to bury the destitute and orphaned, and set out congee to relieve the starving and imprisoned. He often observed fasts and revered the true immortals, and thus was moved to encounter the ancestral master. Since their first meeting, whenever the master sought money or goods to aid others—or demanded wine until he was thoroughly drunk—Qiao gladly provided them without a trace of reluctance or stinginess. At times, the master’s wild and offensive words would provoke him, yet over a year and more, Qiao remained unmoved in heart. Therefore, the ancestral master exerted great effort to guide him into the Dao and cultivate the true. At parting, he bestowed a long poem:\n\nWithin the imperial capital, we met,\nAnd blissfully, you were soon drunk for a year.\nIn drunkenness, you often cherished the true,\nNeither for fame nor for gain.\nI urge you to abandon fleeting glory,\nAnd hasten instead upon the misty rosy path.\nHow to embark on that misty rosy way?\nFirst, let golden essence fly from behind your elbow.\nWhen golden essence soars into the upper palace,\nUpper and lower palaces alike shine with light.\nThen, jade dew trickles forth,\nRushing to the primordial sea like thunder’s roar.\nFrom this, husband and wife meet in joy,\nLeaping and exulting beyond all bounds.\nWater and fire, once two halves in question,\nNow reverse to form Earth over Heaven, supreme.\nOne floats, one sinks—yang refines yin,\nOnly when yin is exhausted is this truth profound.\nAt root, what is this fundamental thing?\nClearly, it is but gold within water.\nQiao, Qiao—act swiftly!\nDo not chase the fleeing crow or fleeing hare.\nHow can one cultivate and become a true immortal?\nThe floating life of this dusty world does not endure.\nCan mortal men attain long life?\nFrom ancient times to now—there are, there are, there are!\n\n*Poetic Imagery:*\nBeyond heaven and earth, what lies concealed?\nDrowsy and silent, ever as if drunk.\nBlending with the world, the work of spirit is complete;\nSpreading the Dao, saving people—how abundant the blessings.\nFavor and disgrace stir no surprise—who displays honor?\nRoaming freely, soaring like the roc’s flight.\nA myriad greens scatter into the chamber of clear ice,\nA single point of perfect clarity, lustrous as crystal.\nPlucking the jade zither, pure and vast,\nLeisurely wielding the jade dust, echoing rare sounds.\nThe pivot turns round and free, wind and clouds gather;\nStirring the mysterious pass, beyond the ultimate.\nThe pure and solemn Daoist wind stills all sounds,\nAs primordial darkness merges with yang in harmony.\nWithin *kan*, true yang; within *li*, true yin—\n*Kan* and *li* conjoined, profoundly subtle.\nIn an instant, wondrous union blends the central palace,\nPure yang of *qian*, a body of sturdy gold.\nShattering emptiness without hands,\nThe footless child flies with skill.\nThe golden youth and formless one stir the mysterious pearl,\nWisdom’s life endures as long as heaven and earth.\nIf one asks of this celestial mechanism,\nI say: the true and primordial holds wondrous being.\n\n**The Ninety-Ninth Transformation: Rectifying the Heart**\nIn the second year of Zhenghe during the reign of Emperor Huizong, the imperial carriage visited the Baolu Palace. After the vegetarian offering and fast were completed, the emperor asked the assembled Daoists: “Does anyone possess extraordinary arts? Can anyone transmute mercury into silver?” None answered, until the lowest-ranking Daoist stepped forward out of turn: “Transmuting mercury into silver relies on some cause and is not worth discussing. This poor Daoist specializes in using earth for the task.” The emperor was astonished and immediately commanded him to proceed. The Daoist then mixed clay, shaped it into silver ingots, and placed them in the furnace. After firing, radiant light burst forth in all directions, and true silver was formed. The Daoist said: “It still lacks luster. Permit this poor Daoist to return to my lodging to fetch the elixir.” He departed but did not return for a long time.\n\nThe emperor ordered his attendants to hasten and summon the Daoist, but his whereabouts were already unknown. The emperor commanded the furnace to be opened, and a single ingot of patterned silver was retrieved, upon which was inscribed a quatrain, as if cast in relief:\n\n*In the world, all clamor to refine mercury into silver,*\n*Most should be false, not true.*\n*For the grand minister of a peaceful age, Zhang Tianjue,*\n*Lü Dongbin wanders the seas as a man of leisure.*\n\nThe emperor and the assembled Daoists were stunned, filled with remorse for failing to recognize a true immortal. The following day, the emperor ordered another vegetarian feast and ritual to offer thanks.\n\nHe composed a poem for the assembly:\n*Alas! Greed for profit led to questions of alchemy,*\n*Deluded views and clouded minds lose their original truth.*\n*A stern warning: in times of peace, no grand minister remains,*\n*Yet one who has known the dust of the world should dwell as a guest of the court.*\n\n---\n\n**The Hundred Transformations of Master Huang**\n\nWhen the Perfected Lord wandered to Mount Wutong, he saw Huang Yizhong, who had abandoned Confucian studies to enter the Dao, steadfast in his devotion to the true. He built a hut to receive traveling Daoist companions from all directions, never resting for years. One day, the Perfected Lord sought lodging, and Huang, recognizing something extraordinary, treated him with reverence each day. The Perfected Lord tested his resolve with contrary intentions, but Huang’s sincerity only deepened, and at last, he received the secret transmission.\n\nFrom then on, Huang’s understanding became profoundly clear. Before parting, he sought final teachings, and the Perfected Lord bestowed upon him a long verse:\n\n*I possess words most wondrous, most profound,*\n*Roaming the eight directions, yet nowhere uttered.*\n*My cloud-borne chariot drifted to Dingyang,*\n*Where I beheld a noble one by the mystic shore.*\n*I knew you were a wanderer like a solitary cloud,*\n*And spoke of the subtle and indistinct, born of stillness.*\n*For the Great Dao is the root and source of all,*\n*And I urge you to seek the true substance in person.*\n*Within it lies one divided into three and five,*\n*Originally nameless, called the Mother of the Elixir.*\n*Cold springs flow dark and ceaseless,*\n*Piercing Kunlun to return to the Purple Palace.*\n*Floating, sinking, rising, descending into the Central Palace,*\n*The four images and five phases all meet in Earth.*\n*Drive the Azure Dragon, seize the White Tiger,*\n*Summon auspicious clouds, descend sweet dew.*\n*Lead congeals true mercury, cinnabar forms the elixir,*\n*A single wheel of fire reigns as the true master.*\n*Having cultivated the truth, you must be steadfast,*\n*Able to turn heaven and earth, to sail mountains and seas.*\n*Its workings are unknown even to heaven and earth,*\n*Its transformations elude even ghosts and spirits.*\n*After a thousand mornings, refine the body of purple gold,*\n*Thus attaining perfection and returning to simplicity.*\n\n*Huang, scholar Huang,*\n*Having cultivated the truth, you must begin early.*\n*In this world, when will all affairs ever end?*\n*Craving fame, craving profit, loving gold in excess,*\n*For their sake, the body withers and ages.*\n*Now I urge you with a sorrowful heart—*\n*Reflect upon yourself, and live with fierce resolve.*\n*Do not let the great limit arrive before you,*\n*Only to drift once more into arising and ceasing.*\n\nThe latter text states: Chang left these few words in the void, expressing his intent, and vowed that upon meeting again, he would part from you for good. Do not waver from your original resolve—nurture well, nurture well.\n\nThree years later, Huang departed into reclusion.\n\nPoem in response to the image:\nBorrowing form to force a name, leaving wondrous words,\nCompassionate clouds and Dharma rain like a dragon’s breath.\nThe Dao’s wind stirs, solemnizing the numinous terrace,\nThe precious cauldron gleams round and bright, illuminating the elixir’s shore.\n\nChang, styled Xuzhong, the Valley Guest,\nWanders boundless, his spirit transforming in the faint and indistinct.\nHe teaches others to cultivate nature and complete the true heart,\nPointing directly to emptiness, forgetting illusory things.\n\nSpirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, intent, and will—these five,\nThe five are the children, the center is the mother.\nWithin the void, the five harmonies attend the one spirit,\nThe one spirit secretly blends, concealed in the mysterious palace.\n\nThe nature-heaven shines bright as the floating dawn,\nThe spirit-land is solemn and pure, the true pure land.\nClouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger,\nSincerity moves in resonance, revealing the whole body.\n\nRaising a finger or stretching a fist—this is but the knowing spirit,\nRaising brows or blinking eyes—these are not the true master.\nEnter the mysterious gate with steadfast sincerity,\nOur ancestor hid for nine years on Mount Hua.\n\nThe heart free of delusion and falsehood is the whole truth,\nNature uninclined to bias is only right awakening.\nA single thought of emptiness restores the original state,\nThe calculating mind vanishes, returning to pure simplicity.\n\nRejoice in the image first, act early,\nLet affairs rest, let the heart be clear.\nWithin the Purple Goldwatch, pay homage to the Three Pure Ones,\nIn the White Jade Hall, attend the Nine Elders.\n\nTranscend the ten thousand dharmas, depart from all things,\nThe wisdom sword’s light burns cold, the heart’s resolve fierce.\nSpirit congeals in the azure void, primordial joy arises,\nThe nature-body of jade-like emptiness endures eternally.\n\nThe *Biographies of the One Hundred and Eleven Transformations of Master Wang, Ancestor of the Way* states: His surname was Wang, his original name Zhongfu, styled Yunqing, a native of Dawei Village in Xianyang. His mother carried him for twenty-four months before his birth, and he was born wise and quick. In maturity, his bearing was imposing, his forehead broad, his eyes large, his beard and whiskers long and fine.\n\nHis aspirations and conduct were lofty, unbound by trivial conventions, and he excelled in both literary and martial arts. In the early years of the Tianchun era, he tested in military strategy, passed the imperial examination, and was renamed Shixiong, styled Dewei. He delighted in almsgiving, aiding others, and accumulated much hidden virtue. Once he sighed, saying: \"Confucius was free from doubt at forty, Mencius unmoved in heart at forty—yet I, past that age, still toil in worldly affairs. Am I not foolish?\"\n\nOne day, the Master drank at a tavern in Ganhe Town when suddenly two men of identical form and visage appeared, each draped in felt robes, sitting and smiling at him. Startled, the Master followed them as they left. Upon reaching their dwelling, he bowed and earnestly sought their instruction. The two immortals slowly replied: \"This one may be taught.\" They then awakened his nature, and the Master suddenly attained enlightenment. The immortals further instructed: \"The wondrous subtlety lies in the clarity of the heart and the illumination of the nature. When your worldly burdens melt like ice and your karmic entanglements dissolve, we shall entrust you to your destined teacher.\" The Master was then named Haichan, renamed Jia, and styled Zhiming. Thereafter, he feigned madness, and people took him for a lunatic—though he accepted the reputation as his own.\n\nUpon closer examination, the two immortals were revealed to be the twin Lüs, the Immortals. Secretly transmitted as the *One Hundred and Second Transformation of Master Chongyang*.\n\nAfter his enlightenment at Ganhe Town, Master Chongyang feigned madness and rejoiced in freedom, untroubled by worldly affairs. Thus, he severed karmic ties and shed worldly burdens, leaving the dust of the mundane behind for over a year. Suddenly, two immortals appeared—clad in blue headscarves and hempen robes, each bearing two sacks and an inverted fan. The Master glimpsed them and recognized the same felt-robed masters from before. He bowed, calling them \"Teacher,\" and invited them into a tavern. As the wine drew to a close, he inquired after their names, but they did not answer. As they departed, they pointed to Liu Haichan’s boat, saying: \"This is your teacher.\" Chongyang paid his respects, and Liu transmitted the secret seal of the true, empty wisdom-life, along with five esoteric verses, instructing: \"Master these thoroughly, then burn them. I am Pure Yang, disciple of the True Yang Master.\" With that, he leaned on his staff alongside Haichan, riding the wind into the clouds.\n\n**The One Hundred and Third Transformation: Jing Zhongshan**\nJing Zhongshan of Changsha resigned from office in Jining during the Jisi year of Jiading and returned home. As his boat docked at the southern ferry of Baling during the evening watch, he suddenly saw another vessel pass by. Aboard it stood a man in a yellow robe, his bearing extraordinary, gazing fixedly at Zhongshan for a long while. Zhongshan peered into the cabin and saw no other belongings—only ten black jars on the bow and two blue-clad youths standing unevenly before the awning. Assuming the man would cross directly, he watched as the boat advanced only two *zhang* before turning back, the yellow-robed figure once more seated solemnly in the stern.\n\nThe two boats sailed side by side for one or two *li*, the man gazing intently at Zhongshan again before the vessel vanished. Zhongshan, who had taken him for a wealthy merchant and not spoken to him, was now struck with astonishment, realizing he had encountered an immortal. The next day, he visited the Lü Immortal Pavilion to pay homage to the true image—there stood the figure in a yellow robe, flanked by two youths in blue, their appearances identical to those he had seen the day before. Zhongshan lamented his mortal eyes’ failure to recognize a divine being and sighed deeply. Later, he composed a *Shuidiao Getou* lyric, including the line: *\"At the southern ferry port, I meet again the boat of Lord Lü.\"*\n\nThe following year, Zhongshan passed away. His grandson Jingjian would later show others a portrait of his grandfather’s encounter with the yellow-robed immortal, depicting one of transcendent purity and aloofness from the world.\n\n**The One Hundred and Fourth Transformation: Visiting Hanshan Temple**\nThe Emperor Lord traveled to Hanshan Temple, resting five *li* outside the Changmen Gate of Suzhou.\n\nOne night, a fierce wind arose, and the temple’s pagoda bells clanged incessantly, their din unceasing even by dawn. That morning, the abbot of the temple served tea. When asked his surname, he replied, “Lü.” As they sat in conversation, the Emperor Lord remarked on the night’s wind that had set the bell chimes clattering so vexatiously. The abbot jested, “You are Master Lü—why not bid the bells fall silent?” The Emperor Lord smiled, then blew a breath to still them, and at once, the clamor ceased. The monks, astonished, looked up—only to find him vanished. Then the abbot realized he had been in the presence of the true Master Lü. Later, the monks removed the old bells and replaced them with new ones, yet to this day, they make no sound.\n\n**The One Hundred and Fifth Transformation: The Portrait at Yizhen**\nAt the Tianqing Abbey in Zhenzhou, the prior had long venerated the Perfected Lord of Pure Yang. One day, he resolved to commission a clay statue for worship. The wooden armature was prepared, and the clay applied—yet the artisan failed to arrive as promised. Suddenly, a scholar seeking lodging appeared. Learning of the prior’s frustration, the scholar inquired and offered, “This humble one is skilled in sculpture. Do not fret; by tomorrow, I shall complete the statue.” The prior, overjoyed, hosted him warmly. That night, the scholar drank deeply and retired. The next morning, the prior invited him to an early meal, but he had already departed. Just then, two or three monks arrived, exclaiming that someone had sculpted a statue of the Perfected Lord Lü in the corridor’s shrine the night before. The prior rushed to see—indeed, the statue stood there, its features refined and spirit luminous, one foot drawn up in serene repose. All rejoiced, offering thanks and alms. From then on, prayers were never unanswered. Later, when fire ravaged the abbey three times, the statue alone remained unscathed. The events are recorded on a stele at the abbey.\n\n**The One Hundred and Sixth Transformation: The Perfected One of Guan Pass**\nThe Perfected One of Guan Pass was born a poor girl with a lofty aspiration to transcend the world. At sixteen, her parents arranged a marriage, but she fled into the mountains and never returned. When hunger gnawed at her, she gathered acorns to eat. Suddenly, an old man appeared—his beard and brows trailing to the ground, his eyes gleaming with a jade-like light. He traced a line across her abdomen and declared, “I have severed your red dragon. From now on, you may enter the Dao.” Guan bowed and sought instruction. The elder imparted esoteric teachings in secret. She thanked him but said, “Yet the burden of sustenance remains—how can I pursue the Dao?” The old man replied, “That is easily solved.” From his sleeve, he produced an acorn, radiant as a pellet of light, and said, “Eat this, and you shall never hunger.” She consumed it, and after some time, it was gone—along with the old man. Upon returning home, she lost all taste for cooked food, eating only fruits and drinking water. Her menses ceased, and her movements became as effortless as a spirit’s. Her parents no longer pressed her to marry. During the Chunyou era, she was summoned to court. The Empress Dowager favored her and ordained her as a Daoist, bestowing the title *Perfected One*. Once, when dispatched by imperial decree to offer incense at the Heavenly Master’s altar on Dragon-Tiger Mountain, a Daoist priest saw her and remarked to others, “Her skin is delicate as jade, her brows and eyes finely wrought—truly a heavenly maiden. Her spirit is serene, her bearing refined beyond the ordinary.” Guan later composed *The Biographies of Female Immortals* in seven fascicles, stating that the old man she met was none other than the Perfected Immortal Dongbin.\n\n**The One Hundred and Seventh Transformation: The Elixir of Mo Di**\nMo Di, an elderly military officer in Yangzhou, had long since resigned his commission. At home, he devoted himself to the Dao, converting many to its Way, accumulating merit to atone for past transgressions, and often fasting with fellow Daoists to aid the poor. One day, a Daoist encountered him and asked, “What Dao have you studied?” Mo replied, “My life has been one of repentance—for the sin of killing. How dare I aspire to the Dao? Since my youth, I have fought in a hundred battles, taking countless lives. Now, at seventy-three, I deeply regret it, for I often see the vengeful spirits of the slain.” The Daoist said, “Life and death follow the same principle; sin and blessing are fundamentally empty. If you deem yourself guilty, guilt manifests. If you see no sin, evil vanishes. The forms and shadows of your foes arise from your own mind—they are not real. The ancients, whether committing great good or great evil, found that at the extreme, a single thought could reverse fate—its power is immense.” He then led Mo to the water’s edge, where Mo indeed saw over a hundred blood-drenched figures gathering around him. Terrified, he wept and begged for mercy. The Daoist shouted, and the vengeful spirits scattered. He then gave Mo three elixir pellets, saying, “Take three, and you shall become a celestial immortal; two, an earthly immortal; one, a lord of the underworld.” Mo placed the pellets on his palm—one ascended into the sky, one fell to the earth, and he swallowed the last. The Daoist said, “Your fate is thus determined.” Mo bowed and asked his name. The Daoist traced the character *Lü* in the air before vanishing. From then on, Mo abstained from cooked food, and his insight into others’ fortunes grew keen. At the age of one hundred and three, he sat upright and passed away.\n\n**The One Hundred and Eighth Transformation: The Crossing of Monk Zhang**\nThe monk Zhixuan of Mount Heng, surnamed Zhang, once visited the Xiugai Peak’s Monastery of Cultivating the Real. There, he encountered the Emperor Lord, and their exchange of Chan wit was so swift and harmonious that it seemed fated. The Emperor Lord asked, “In the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, when Śākyamuni Buddha and Prabhūtaratna Buddha enter the stupa and merge, sitting side by side on the golden couch without distinction of left or right—what do they speak of?” The monk was at a loss. He bowed and asked for an answer. The Emperor Lord replied, “This is the true Dharma of the Buddha and patriarchs—the eye that conceals the true form, the marvel of mind-to-mind transmission beyond the teachings of emptiness and reality. The merging of the two Buddhas is the fusion of nature and life. Their lack of distinction between left and right is the unity of the Great Void. You cling to one side, believing that seeing nature is sufficient for enlightenment—how partial is your view!” The monk bowed again and begged for further instruction. The Emperor Lord imparted a secret teaching. The monk exclaimed, “Without meeting a true master, I would have nearly wasted this life!” The Emperor Lord then inscribed a poem to mark the occasion:\n\n*For a hundred autumns, Pure Yang’s Dao has faded,*\n*Yet the five lakes and four seas remain his to roam.*\n*This body has already transcended the three thousand realms,*\n*Each day, I traverse scores of states.*\n*Drunk beneath the clear wind and bright moon,*\n*I trample the red smartweed and white duckweed isles.*\n\nThe Chan monks in their sleeves should not laugh at me,\nFor I dwell at the summit of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra’s* realm.\nThe monk expressed his gratitude, stepped out the door, and departed on a cloud.\n\n*Record of the Wondrous Spiritual Transformations of Emperor Lord Pure Yang, Scroll Seven—Concluded*",

Compiled by Miao Shanshi of the Yuan dynasty.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, category of *Dongzhen* hagiographies and records.\n\n**Preface to *The Wondrous Manifestations of the Divine Transformations of Lord Pure Yang***\n\nThe Dao, at times, employs divine transformations to guide the worldly, or remedies to succor the virtuous. Yielding and adapting, it responds with expedient means—great compassion and boundless transformation—gathering the myriad beings to return to the One Source. Utmost aspiration and perfect benevolence embrace all virtues without clinging to any single one.\n\nTo awaken to the unceasingness of the non-empty, to comprehend the mystery of primordial arising—such subtleties defy exhaustive speech. To grasp their essence through conjecture is as distant as attempting to measure thought with intellect; only through sincere devotion and silent communion may they be realized.\n\nUndeterred by my shallow insight, I have gleaned from the scriptures, gathered from Tang and Song histories and biographies, and compiled verified accounts, stripping away embellishments to weave one hundred and twenty transformations into six fascicles. Each chapter concludes with harmonizing poems and lyrics, presented in straightforward exposition, entitled *The Wondrous Manifestations of the Divine Transformations*.\n\nMay those of kindred spirit, upon opening this volume, perceive the celestial patterns, silently apprehend the subtleties of the Dao, and attain luminous comprehension of the Primordial Ultimate, penetrating the profound mystery.\n\nLord Pure Yang’s perfect and wondrous penetration of the Dao, his attainment of the primordial spring of the precelestial, is beyond my humble capacity to compile. Yet with reverent intent, I offer this work to the discerning, that they may reflect upon nature’s spontaneity, avoid deviant paths, and proceed directly to the celestial thoroughfare.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Miao Shanshi, the Elder of Central Harmony of Jinling.\n\n**Imperial Edict**\n\nThe Emperor proclaims: The Great Dao unfolds its name, effecting transformations through primordial potency. The Perfect Real abides in freedom, achieving the work of non-interference.\n\nOur ancestral line has established this foundation. Revering the illustrious eras of old, We have long admired the mystic wind. From the lingering teachings of Chonghua to the dawning dispensation of Chongyang, the true has remained undimmed, transmitted across generations. Responses arise and resonate, though the origin be distant and unattainable.\n\nThough previous dynasties have repeatedly bestowed honors, in Our heart, We still deem such tributes insufficient. Thus, We command the scholar-officials to confer exalted titles: let Chonghua be styled *Emperor* and *Lord*, with the addition of *Purple Palace* and *Lesser Yang*. As for Zhengyang, Pure Yang, and Haichan, let them be granted the title *Perfected Lord*; the Seven Perfected below shall be styled *Perfected Ones*, their names inscribed in the annals to be transmitted for ten thousand generations.\n\nAlas! In the Han, Zhang Daoling was granted the title *Celestial Master*, and in the Tang, Ye Fashan likewise—such honors have ever been the glory of the Dao’s lineage. In this age, no dissenting voices shall arise; let this be established as a fixed institution. In this, perhaps Our aspirations may be fulfilled.",

      "translated_text": "In his childhood, he was solemn and spoke little, disinclined to play. As he grew, his stature exceeded six *chi*. His frame bore the bones of a Daoist immortal, his phoenix eyes extending to his temples, his brows refined and nose tall, his complexion a blend of yellow and white. Beneath his left brow and beside his right eye, he bore moles the size of beans, and beneath his feet, tortoise-shell patterns subtly emerged. By nature, he was pure, sincere, benevolent, filial, and keen of wit. The Three Teachings’ scriptures he mastered with profound comprehension, often reciting the *Book of Changes*, the *Dao and Its Virtue*, and the *Scripture of the Hidden Correspondence*. He favored wearing the *Huayang* cap, a yellow or white bordered robe with a broad sash, or else the carefree garb of a scholar. Later, he refused marriage, ever cherishing clarity and tranquility, disdaining ostentation and wealth. From his earliest years, his heart was already set upon the Daoist path.\n\nThe *Xiangzhang* observes: The Great Dao is inherently possessed by all, fully manifest in every being. Yet since birth, people are assailed by worldly desires, deluded by profit and fame. Moreover, lacking good fortune and ancestral virtue, they drift ever farther from the Dao. Thus the immortal masters declare: To attain the Dao and ascend to perfection, one relies upon the profound accumulated virtue of ancestors and one’s own innate wisdom, resolute will, and steadfast resolve from past lives—this eases the path to realization. Are these empty words? This chronicle records that the *Perfected Lord* was by nature pure and sincere, benevolent, filial, and keen of wit, mastering the Three Teachings’ scriptures at a glance—surely this is the fruit of innate wisdom and resolve from past lives. His grandfather, *Governor of Shanzhou*, delighted in goodness and the Dao, his governance rich in hidden virtue; all four of his sons rose to prominence. His father, *Rang*, was pure, sincere, and benevolent, his governance earning fine repute, the people’s reverence and admiration. Thus his name reached the throne, and he was promoted to the Crown Prince’s household. Through such sincerity, he moved the hearts of true immortals, who descended in response—was this not the overflowing blessing of accumulated goodness? Since coming of age, the *Perfected Lord* refused marriage, treasuring his essence and spirit—was this not the reverence for the body, skin, and hair bequeathed by his parents? With unwavering resolve, he cultivated the true, his mind serene and nature radiant, nurturing vastness and delighting in Heaven. His name resounded through later ages—was this not the essential way of perfecting virtue to honor his parents? Moreover, he inherited the lineage of the *Mysterious Origin* and the Daoist succession, his name inscribed in the *Purple Palace* of the immortals. As the sacred teacher of Heaven and humanity, his divine transformations knew no bounds, his presence now hidden, now revealed—how could he be spoken of in the same breath as ordinary sages?\n\nSome doubt the discrepancies in various accounts regarding the *Perfected Lord*’s birthplace and residences. Upon careful examination, these stem from his father’s official postings and relocations, as well as authors’ desires to claim him for their native regions, leading to inconsistencies. Today, the old homestead at *Jiufeng Mountain* in *Yongle Town*, *Hezhong Prefecture*, remains intact, and the *Chunyang Wanshou Palace* now stands upon its foundations. *Yongle County* was redesignated a town during the *Xining* era of the Song.

      "translated_text": "In the fifth year of the *Yuanhe* era of Emperor Xianzong of Tang, at the age of twenty-one, he journeyed to Chang’an to sit for the imperial examinations and lodged at an inn. One day, a Daoist adept of extraordinary appearance—his features ancient and noble, his beard full and eyes bright, clad in a crane-feather cloak and long robes—entered the inn without ceremony, bowed, and took a seat. He engaged the *Perfected Lord* in conversation, seeking to guide him onto the Dao. The *Perfected Lord* replied, “Let me first secure an official post to bring glory to my ancestors and uphold our family’s reputation; then I shall follow you, Master, without delay.”\n\nThe adept smiled and asked for a simple meal. The *Perfected Lord* ordered his servant to prepare rice. Feeling weary, he was about to sleep when the adept drew a pillow from his sleeve and said, “This is a *ruyi* pillow. If you rest upon it, all your desires shall be fulfilled.” As soon as he lay down, he dreamed that a messenger arrived, summoning the top-ranked scholar Lü to receive his commission. Beginning as a local magistrate, he was swiftly promoted to the imperial court, ascending through the ranks of remonstrance officials, the Hanlin Academy, and the Secret Pavilion, holding every esteemed post in turn. He was demoted and elevated by turns, married twice into wealthy families, and saw his descendants flourish, his halls filled with scholars and officials. Thus passed nearly forty years. For the last decade, he served as sole chancellor, his power and influence overwhelming. Then, suddenly, he was charged with a grave crime: his family’s property was confiscated, his wives and children scattered, and he was exiled to the southern frontier, left destitute and emaciated. As he stood in the wind and snow, sighing in despair, he awoke with a start.\n\nThe adept, still beside him, laughed and said, “The millet is not yet cooked, yet you’ve dreamed your way to the land of *Huaxu*.” The *Perfected Lord* exclaimed in astonishment, “Do you know my dream?” The adept replied, “In the span of a single moment, you have experienced fifty years of glory and ruin, of countless joys and sorrows. What is there to rejoice in gaining, or to grieve in losing? Only when one awakens to the Great Awakening does one realize that this is but a great dream. A human life of a hundred years is likewise but a single great dream.”\n\nThe *Perfected Lord* was suddenly enlightened: “Even the highest ranks of office, halls filled with gold and jade—when viewed thus, are but the playthings of fate. What is there to cling to?” He bowed deeply and said, “Master, you are no ordinary man. I beg you to enlighten this ignorant one.” The adept replied, “Now that you have pierced the illusions of the world—its fleeting flowers, its hollow fame and profit—turning your heart toward the Dao will be easy.”\n\nThe *Perfected Lord* said, “I have had a slight awakening. As the *Yi* says of the wandering soul and the transformations of life and death, I seek the principle of exhausting one’s nature to fulfill destiny. I implore you, Master, in your compassion, to instruct me in the path of cultivation.” The adept remained silent for a long while before speaking: “When the myriad principles merge and flow, the heart becomes clear and luminous. When the seven emotions are stilled, one’s nature becomes perfectly bright. When the heart is serene and at rest, the original nature is as jade and empty—what need is there for a wandering soul to transform? The nature is one with the Great Void, silent and vast, beyond birth and extinction. What fear of life and death remains? Know that I was never born—how then can there be death?”\n\nThe *Perfected Lord* stood in bewilderment for a long time before a great clarity dawned. He bowed again in gratitude and said, “By the fortune of past lives, I have met a true immortal. Just now, hearing your compassionate words of profound meaning, I suddenly forgot my own existence.” The adept said, “What I have told you is but one aspect of the wondrous truth of exhausting one’s nature. As for the great matter of the ultimate destiny of the wise spirit, it is not yet time to transmit it—wait until you are truly free and unburdened.” The *Perfected Lord* thanked him, saying, “Who are you, Master?”\n\nThe adept replied, “My surname is Zhongli, though this is but a provisional name. My style is Yunfang. I dwell on Crane Ridge of the Seven Stars Mountain in Zhongnan. Seek me there another day.” With that, he vanished like the wind. The *Perfected Lord* said, “Though I am dismayed, I am also joyful.” The next day, he returned to his hometown.\n\n*Xiangzhang* observes: The Old Immortal of *Nanhua* was suddenly awakened by the dream of a butterfly. The *Perfected Lord of Pure Yang* was thoroughly enlightened by the dream of the millet. Thus, the *Nanhua Sutra* says: “Only when one awakens to the Great Awakening does one realize that this is a great dream.” The *Perfected Lord of Pure Yang* was suddenly and completely enlightened, seeing through the emptiness of all illusions and penetrating the One True. How profound! How sublime!\n\n**The Third Transformation: Compassionate Virtue and Hidden Merit**\nUpon returning to his hometown, the *Perfected Lord* encountered a famine. He sold all his property and grain to relieve the starving poor, saving nearly twenty or thirty thousand lives. The elders and relatives of his village rejoiced but also urged him to retain some wealth for the sake of his descendants. The *Perfected Lord* sighed and said, “The fault of humanity lies in the heart. Deluded and confused about one’s original nature, one becomes attached to illusory things, clinging to wealth and possessions, giving rise to greed, anger, hatred, love, and sinking into the bitter realms of suffering. I do not presume to rebuke my kin, but having had a slight awakening, I find nothing worth clinging to.” He composed a poem to show his village elders and relatives:\n\n*I’ve shattered the embroidered gourd, trampled the zither underfoot,*\n*And with a flick of my sleeve, left the world of scholars behind.*\n*The Great Beginning’s true form is pure as jade,*\n*The Primordial True Suchness gleams like gold.*\n*Cinnabar flames rise to the heavens, beyond the ken of gods,*\n*The sword’s edge pierces the earth, eluding even ghosts.*\n*Since awakening from the millet dream,*\n*I know all my past efforts were in vain.*\n\nLater, he bid farewell to his hometown and set out alone for Zhongnan Mountain to seek his master, though none could dissuade him.",

The village elders and relatives, moved by gratitude and respect, urged him to preserve his wealth for his descendants. The Perfected One sighed and said: “What people lose is their own minds. Deluded and ignorant of their true nature, they cling to illusory things, hoard wealth, and so give rise to anger, vexation, love, and sinking into the bitter realms of suffering. I do not presume to rebuke my esteemed kin, but having thoroughly awakened to the dreamlike nature of existence, I see that this body is but a temporary vessel—how then could worldly possessions be worth clinging to?”\n\nThereupon, he composed this poem to bid farewell and enter the Dao.

The Perfected One’s flying sword severed the yellow dragon—how foolish! As the Perfected One’s verse declares: *“A grain of millet holds the world, a mustard seed contains Mount Sumeru, a cauldron boils mountains and rivers.”* This echoes the Sixth Patriarch’s *“Kalpa-fire burns the ocean’s depths”*—all metaphors for the wondrous subtlety of the wisdom-life of true emptiness, like the prajñā of the Vedas, the language of wisdom.

      "translated_text": "Within the Gate of Mystery, Miao Shanshi collated and arranged the poetic imagery. The Fourth Transformation: Trials by the Five Demons.\n\nAs the Perfected Lord prepared to leave his hometown, he suddenly saw all his family stricken with illness and dead. His heart remained unmoved by sorrow, yet he prepared the funeral rites. Suddenly, those who had died rose without ailment—this was the first trial.\n\nOne night, dozens of bandits appeared, each brandishing blades and cudgels, demanding his wealth. In moments, all the treasures of his household were plundered and gone. The Perfected Lord remained utterly composed, allowing them to take what they wished—this was the second trial.\n\nNext, as he bid farewell to his village, he lost his way after a few leagues. Dusk fell, and in the distance, he saw a light. Approaching, he found two thatched huts. An old man emerged, carrying fishing nets. The Perfected Lord stepped forward, bowed, and asked for lodging. The old man replied, “I live alone and must fish by night.” After repeated refusals, he finally opened the door, saying, “Scholar, rest here. I go to fetch fish.” He instructed the Perfected Lord to bolt the door. In an instant, a woman of about twenty knocked, calling out. Assuming her to be the old man’s kin, the Perfected Lord opened the door. The woman entered with a bundle, bowed, and said, “Scholar, I lost my way in the night and seek shelter.” The Perfected Lord replied, “This is not my home. I, too, am a guest here, lodging with the fisherman. I dare not offer you shelter.” The woman said, “We are both travelers—why refuse me a single night? The hour is late, the darkness deep; I cannot go on.” She employed every art of seduction, adding, “My family owns boundless fields and wealth. I carry gold and treasures—why not take me as your wife? I would not wrong you.” The Perfected Lord sat in silence, unmoved, enduring her every ploy. At dawn, he opened his eyes to find himself seated beneath a great tree. He smiled to himself and rose to continue his journey—this was the third trial.\n\nNext, he came to a ferry crossing. Spring floods had swollen the waters, and a small boat approached. He sought passage, and as the boat reached midstream, a black wind arose, followed by towering waves, thunder, lightning, and torrential rain. The boat tossed violently, nearly capsizing. The Perfected Lord closed his eyes and sat in deep meditation, resigned to life or death, his heart as steadfast as Mount Tai. As they neared the shore, the boat overturned and sank, but he managed to reach land. When asked why, he only smiled and did not answer—this was the fourth trial.\n\nThat night, he lodged at an inn. Around the third watch, strange and monstrous forms appeared—countless ghosts and spirits, some intent on beating him, others on killing him. The Perfected Lord sat in majestic stillness, ignoring them all. Soon, several yakshas dragged forward a prisoner, bloodied and wailing, brandishing a sword. “You killed me in a past life,” it cried. “Today, you must repay my life!” The Perfected Lord replied, “If I took your life, then I should repay it. What more is there to say?” He bared his neck, ready for the blow. Suddenly, a rebuke rang out from the void, and the ghosts and spirits scattered. A man clapped his hands and laughed, saying, “I am Zhongli Quan of Cloud Chamber. I have long lamented that true immortals are rare, and the dust-bound hearts of men are hard to extinguish. My search for one who seeks the Dao surpasses even their desire to find me. Thus, I tested you five times, and you remained unmoved. You are fit to be taught. Yet your merit and conduct are not yet complete. For now, I will teach you the secret method of refining cinnabar and gold, so you may aid others. When your merit is full, I will come to deliver you.” The Perfected Lord said, “I have received the oral instructions for alchemy.” He then asked, “Once refined, will these substances change over time?” Zhongli Quan replied, “After three thousand years, they will revert to their original form.” The Perfected Lord sighed and said, “Then this would mislead people three thousand years hence. I do not wish to do this.” Zhongli Quan said, “With such a heart, your three thousand eight hundred merits are already complete.” The imagery concludes: “The depths of human appearance and emotion are most difficult to fathom. Thus, the *Nanhua Sutra* states: ‘Test a man with ten trials to know his true nature.’ The *Book of Changes* speaks of four grades of speech to discern sincerity or deceit. How much more so for those who cultivate the Dao and seek to become great sages? It is no trifling matter. Thus, the *Sacred Scriptures* say: ‘The more one takes things lightly, the more difficulties arise.’ Even sages find this hard—how much more so for us? Yet observe our kind: adversity stirs anger, prosperity brings joy. The dust of worldly thoughts, the breath of common air, old habits and familiar paths—all govern our actions. We are bound by the nature of blood and qi, yet to unlearn the nature of custom is no small task. Not a hair’s breadth has changed, yet we boast grandly, our words vast and empty, our demeanor haughty, brows raised, eyes glaring. We wave our dusters, brandish our staffs, clench our fists, point our fingers, shout and bellow, rave and rage—every manner of affectation. And we call this our ‘original, heavenly nature,’ a sudden, complete transcendence! This is nothing but clutching filth and crying injustice, covering one’s ears to steal a bell—self-deception of the deepest kind. How pitiful! The Perfected Lord of Primordial Yang subjected himself to trials of demons and favorable circumstances, yet the Perfected Lord of Pure Yang’s heart remained as jade and void, unshakable. Even when offered the art of alchemy to establish merit, he refused. Was this not fitting? The Perfected Lord of Primordial Yang clapped his hands in delight and received him as his disciple.\n\nWe, with our careless minds and trivial virtues, seek only self-liberation. Hearing of these trials and remaining unmoved—how can we not tremble with awe?”\n\nThe Fifth Transformation: Divine Manifestations and the Transmission of Scriptures.\n\nThe Perfected Master of Primordial Yang said, “I dwell in the Cave Heaven of Crane Ridge on Mount Zhongnan. Would you follow me there?” The Perfected Lord of Pure Yang replied, “I would gladly attend your phoenix carriage, Master.” Taking the True Man’s hand, they set forth. After but a few steps, all became hazy, and a gust of wind carried them across mountains and rivers. In an instant, they arrived at Crane Ridge. Before the cave, two tigers stood guard. The Master rebuked them, and they departed. Soon, the gates opened, revealing celestial guards in attendance. Amidst auspicious clouds and mist, jade terraces and golden halls gleamed, their vermilion doors studded with golden nails, their jasper steps and gilded pavilions resplendent with rare trees and precious blossoms.",

      "translated_text": "Two immortal youths welcomed the Master into the jade hall, where he took his central seat, while the Imperial Lord sat in attendance. The air was warm as spring, and the scenery transcended the mortal realm. Soon, a dozen or so celestial lads presented elixirs of primordial harmony and immortal fruits as offerings. After partaking, as they sat at leisure, the Imperial Lord rose from his seat and asked, “What cave heaven is this?”\n\nThe Master replied, “This was once the former abode of my master, the Imperial Lord of Eastern Florescence—the Lesser Yang Grotto-Heaven.”\n\nThe Imperial Lord bowed twice and inquired, “How many kinds of immortals are there in the cultivation of transcendence, and what merits lead one to such a state?”\n\nThe Master said, “There are fifteen ranks of immortals in the refinement of truth. Let me briefly describe a few.\n\nThose who awaken to the world’s impermanence, where arising and ceasing are fleeting, illusions all empty, and worldly thoughts suddenly stilled—whose original nature shines with perfect clarity—are called *Pure and Numinous Ghost Immortals*.\n\nThose who emulate the celestial cycles of ascent and descent, the subtle ebb and flow of yin and yang, using body and mind as cauldron and furnace, essence and breath as elixir—who empty the five aggregates and still the seven emotions—whose physical form grows light and agile over time, drifting like a cloud, are called *Luminous Earth Immortals*.\n\nThose who extinguish all passions and desires, dissolve attachments and delusions, whose minds become lucid, whose nature is emptiness—who take the Great Ultimate as their furnace and heaven and earth as their cauldron, refining primordial essence, calming primordial qi, and coalescing primordial spirit—where the three primals merge in wondrous union, and the one true body is mysterious—who transcend the semblance of form, rising beyond the unbegun, beyond the ken of ghosts and spirits, whose transformations are boundless—are called *Divine Immortals*.\n\nThose whose spirit and breath fuse in marvelous harmony, whose transformations are unfathomable, whose form dissolves into the formless, whose nature and life abide in jade-like emptiness—whose body is one with the Great Void, where true emptiness is not empty, and the great image is imageless—who roam freely beyond the ultimate, swimming in the primordial, suddenly transcending the natural void to reach the Jade Purity Realm—are called *Celestial Immortals*.”\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, “Are these all encompassed by the Great Dao?”\n\nThe Master replied, “The Great Dao is without form or name, without question or response. Vast beyond measure, yet contained within the infinitesimal, it fills the cosmos and governs the ages. It neither changes nor shifts, neither lives nor dies. It transforms without transforming, is divine without divinity. Subtle, wondrous, serene, and spontaneous—ineffable and beyond description. Strive diligently, my disciple.”\n\nSuddenly, two immortals appeared, clad in golden crowns and rosy robes, jade pendants and cloud-like garments, bearing a jade decree and golden script. They summoned the Celestial Selection Envoy of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Tower, Zhongli of such-and-such, to attend the Jasper Pool Immortal Assembly in the Upper Palace of Penglai. The Master received the decree, whereupon the Perfected One presented a poem:\n\n*“To meet once attained the Dao is rare indeed,*\n*Now you ascend the immortal altar with haste.*\n*At your staff’s tip, spring’s hue in a gourd of wine,*\n*Atop your head, clouds pierce the Five Peaks’ crown.*\n*The sea-turtle drinker goes unrecognized,*\n*The mountain-burning talisman defies ghostly eyes.*\n*When you depart, this frame must wither—*\n*Grant this poor wretch the Elixir of Bone-Transformation!”*\n\nFearing the Master’s swift departure would leave no time for return, the Master smiled and drew from his sleeve a scroll of the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure: Ascending the Mysterious and Dissolving Disasters to Protect Life*, which he entrusted to the Perfected One. He admonished again, “This scripture was transmitted by the Imperial Lord of Eastern Florescence. Within it lies the wondrous subtlety of true emptiness and profound mystery, cutting through all illusions of form, sound, and false appearances. Study it well. I shall return before long. Take care, take care.”",

      "translated_text": "Xiangzhang said:\n\"The Valley Spirit unobscured is called *Ling* (Numinous).\nThe fusion of primordial darkness is called *Bao* (Treasure).\nPenetrating the Mysterious Pass to ascend the supreme realm is called *Shengxuan* (Ascending the Mysterious).\nThe blending of heart and breath to preserve the Great Harmony is called *Huming* (Protecting Life).\"\n\nWithin the scripture, it speaks of sentient beings mired in stagnation, deluded by sound and form. From primordial chaos to the ultimate state—knowing emptiness as not-empty, knowing form as not-form—this is called *zhaoliao* (illuminating clarity), the first attainment of the wondrous tone. Recognizing the Dharma of primordial emptiness, one perceives without obstruction. Entering the gate of manifold subtleties, enlightenment arises naturally. Free from the net of doubts, one does not cling to the view of emptiness.\n\nThe above words are concise and apt, merging nature and principle. All three teachings’ essential truths— the great treasury of true emptiness—are fully contained in this scripture. Yet how lamentable that these practitioners recite it daily without ever savoring its true flavor, merely amassing superficial interpretations!\n\nThe Perfected Master first instructed in the methods of ghost immortals, earth immortals, and divine immortals, then bestowed this scripture—how could there not be wondrous subtleties beyond intent? Those who aspire to the Dao must earnestly chew and savor it.\n\n**Chapter Six: Illuminating the Dao in Its Mysterious Embodiment**\nThe True Master of Upright Yang attended the assembly and, after more than ten days, returned to the grotto-heaven. The Imperial Lord joyfully welcomed him with repeated bows. The Master said, \"You have dwelled in this secluded place for days—do you now wish to return?\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord replied, \"My worldly entanglements are already severed, and mundane darkness has dissipated. With my heart set on the Dao, why would I long for my homeland?\"\n\nThe Master nodded in approval and comforted him. The Imperial Lord then asked, \"The soul and spirit dwell in obscurity, and the supreme principle is profoundly subtle—how may one preserve the true?\"\n\nThe Master said, \"The lamp of wisdom shines in darkness; in perfect stillness, the spirit is numinous. When spirit and essence merge, how could one not unite with the true? The golden form and jade substance arise from essence and spirit. The method and image of ascension shall be imparted in oral instructions.\"\n\nAs the Imperial Lord bowed again in gratitude, golden light radiated brilliantly within the grotto, and a harmonious clarity pervaded the air. The Imperial Lord knelt in ninefold reverence and said, \"I have studied various alchemical scriptures and their hexagrams with differing names, yet many doubts remain. I beseech you, Master, in your compassion, to dispel my ignorance and elucidate each in detail.\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"The heart has no boundaries—where do doubts arise? Before heaven and earth took form, before parents were born, even the word *Dao* is but a forced name. What hexagrams or differing names could there be? Since you have doubts, do not hesitate to raise them.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"The alchemical texts speak of cultivating the Golden Elixir—what is the Golden Elixir?\"\n\nThe Master said, \"Gold is a metaphor for firmness; elixir, for roundness. It is your inherent nature—luminous, round, and indestructible.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"Are nature and life one or two?\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"They cannot be called one, nor can they be called two. The single point of numinous clarity is the primordial essence of nature. The single point of primordial *qi* is the ever-regulated life. If nature lacks life, they cannot rely on each other and cannot be at peace. If life lacks nature, they cannot interpenetrate and cannot be firmly consolidated. When the two merge, they become a single true and jadelike purity. Nature and life are both but forced names.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are water and fire?\"\n\nThe Master answered, \"Primordial spirit is fire; primordial *qi* is water. When spirit and *qi* blend, water and fire achieve harmony.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are true yin and true yang?\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"The single point of primordial essence within the body is true yin. The single point of primordial *qi* is true yang. When essence and *qi* fuse intimately, yin and yang merge into a singular, undifferentiated body.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are *kan* (坎) and *li* (离)?\"\n\nThe Master said, \"They are the images of yin-yang and water-fire mentioned earlier. Yang within yin is *kan*; yin within yang is *li*. Extracting the one yang from *kan* and returning the one yin to *li* forms the pure yang of *qian* (乾).\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What is the arising of the one yang?\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"It is the moment when the primordial *qi* within the body stirs. At the extreme of stillness, a single movement arises—this is the birth of the one yang. As the *Daodejing* says, 'Subtle and continuous, its use is never exhausted.' When the time arrives, the spirit knows it. At this moment, the abyss is clear, thoughts cease, and inner illumination naturally governs the ascent and descent of the Three Palaces. Clinging to the four cardinal points of *zi* and *wu* as the time of generation is all delusion. Not knowing the constant and acting recklessly invites misfortune.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What is the fire timing?\"\n\nThe Master answered, \"Wisdom is fire; *qi* is timing. When heart and breath interdepend, subtly and warmly sustained, this is the fire timing of civil refinement. When emotions arise and thoughts stir, with resolute will and forceful return, this is the fire timing of martial vigor.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are the medicinal substances?\"",

When the primordial spirit congeals within, it is forcibly named the 'Spirit Valley.' When the primordial *qi* rests within, it is forcibly named the 'Mysterious Female.' Metaphorically, it is the mysterious aperture within the body, the valley of emptiness and primal origin. It is the locus of primordial perfection, neither existent nor void. As the *Daodejing* states, 'The valley spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female'—this is precisely that wondrous principle.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are the Green Dragon and White Tiger?\"\n\nThe Master answered, \"Nature pertains to wood, hence it is metaphorically called the Green Dragon. Emotion pertains to metal, hence it is metaphorically called the White Tiger. Metal can overcome wood, so emotion often harms nature. If one can truly gather emotion back into nature, then metal and wood will be without conflict and become one, and naturally the dragon and tiger will be subdued.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are the Tortoise and Snake?\"\n\nThe Master answered, \"They are the symbolic representations of water and fire, yin and yang, as previously described.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord asked, \"What are lead and mercury?\"\n\nThe Master answered, \"They are the heart and *qi*. The heart is like mercury, difficult to subdue; if one can truly still the *qi* and nurture the heart, then the heart will die, and nature will become perfectly luminous. If one can empty the heart and cultivate vastness, then the *qi* will rest, and the life-force will no longer leak. Lead can control mercury, so the sages borrowed these two substances as metaphors to teach people the ease of cultivating truth. As for the eight trigrams and five phases, all are metaphors employed to return to the origin. The four images and three powers are all forced names to convey the Dao. If you can still the heart and rest the *qi*, rest the *qi* and congeal the spirit, so that *qi* and spirit merge as one, heart and nature share a single source, and a body exists beyond the body—then the corporeal form becomes the Jade Void. All these many discussions are but clouds obscuring the vast sky, dust on the mirror, or wind upon the water.

      "translated_text": "Xiangzhang said: \"This dialogue between master and ancestor has been secretly transmitted by successive sagely teachers, heart-to-heart as a hidden seal, bestowed only upon virtuous and aspiring scholars—with strict injunctions never to lightly reveal it to ordinary people. I, Fengsheng, count myself most fortunate to have encountered it. As I silently revered and savored its heart-transmission, I burned incense and performed the nine prostrations, offering gratitude in the emptiness of space. Every word is golden scripture, every character a pearl of jade—these are the most wondrous and precise teachings of cultivating truth. Herein lie the profound mysteries of illuminating the heart and nurturing nature, the marvelous functions of wisdom-life and true emptiness. All are contained within.\n\nI, the dull one, have often sighed in private at the worldly transmissions of *Lingbao Bifa* and *Zhong-Lü Chuandao Ji*, which are riddled with errors and distortions, composed by those who seek fame and novelty. Some attribute them to Shi Jianwu, though it remains uncertain. Others have cobbled together spurious texts, compiling records to validate principles and events, claiming them as the root of Dao transmission—truly the croaking of well-frogs. They mistake thieves for brothers, cast stones as earth, and lead the blind with blindness, displaying shamelessness beyond measure. I dare not speak further, for there are other treasures to be revealed.\"\n\n**Seventh Transformation: The Secret Seal of the Sword**\n\nDuring a tranquil sitting, the Perfected One of True Yang addressed the Imperial Lord of Pure Yang: \"To embody the Dao in cultivation relies entirely on the steadfast power of wisdom. To enter the wondrous and fathom the profound, one must first possess a resolute and unyielding will. Thus, from ultimate end to primal beginning, even heaven and earth cannot alter it. In its great function and subtle mechanism, even ghosts and spirits cannot fathom it. Therefore, the sages wield the treasure sword, inverting the pivot to traverse the celestial sphere, relying on its unyielding edge to directly subdue demons and monsters—hence the metaphor of the sword technique.\n\nThis sword is forged from the purest essence of the primordial extreme, blended with the primordial *qi* of pre-heaven, tempered in the furnace and scabbard of heaven and earth, and wrought with the pincers and hammer of the White Origin. Refined by the fire of wisdom and sharpened by the spring of spirit, it takes the Supreme Ultimate as its ring, firmness-within-softness as its hilt, keen sharpness as its blade, and purity as its scabbard. Radiant in empty whiteness, it is utterly pure, firm, and unyielding. It moves with the mechanism of creation and transformation, wielding the mandate of benevolence and awe. Raised, it transcends past and present; pressed, it knows no before or after. The gods and ghosts of the Six Heavens submit, the demons and monsters of the Three Realms beg for mercy. It shatters the hindrances of affliction, severs the bonds of greed and desire. It slays the seven emotions, executes the six thieves, severs wrath, and annihilates delusion and perversity. When matters arise, they are resolved at the blade’s edge. Concealed within the body, it can transcend life and death, embodying the primordial. Wielded in governance, it can pacify the nation and purify the world. Its brilliance and efficacy are vast, perfectly blending firmness and softness. At its sight, the treacherous grow cold with fear; at its name, heretics shatter with dread.\n\nYou must advance with diligence, perfecting the horizontal and vertical, so that the Great Void stands awe-inspiring.\"\n\nThe Imperial Lord received this sword technique with utmost reverence, bowing in gratitude. Concealing its radiance and obscuring its edge, he secretly descended upon Huafeng Peak, naming it: *The Pre-Heavenly Reclusive Spirit Sword*.\n\nWhen the disciples of the teaching obtained this sword treatise, they savored and pondered it with boundless joy, composing the *Ode to the Wisdom Sword*:\n\n*In the Purple Ultimate Grotto, the sword’s secret is transmitted,*\n*Neither yin nor yang, nor forged of iron.*\n*The primordial qi of pre-heaven warms and melts, surging forth,*\n*Once cast, it can slay demonic afflictions.*\n\n*Refined by warmth, tempered and polished,*\n*Its edge surpasses Zhanlu and Moye, even Great E.*\n*Grasped in hand, dragons and tigers submit;*\n*Sheathed, the spirit and qi harmonize.*\n\n*It slays the Three Corpses, executes the Five Thieves,*\n*Annihilates the seven emotions and six desires.*\n*Greed, hatred, and delusion vanish entirely,*\n*Confused and scattered demonic hosts are utterly destroyed.*\n\n*It can give life, it can kill,*\n*Its authority over life and death flashes like lightning.*\n*When matters arise, they are resolved at the blade’s edge;*\n*When worries and doubts surge, they are quelled by its tip.*\n\n*Our Ancestor Lü, having obtained this sword,*\n*Opened and established heaven and earth as one expanse.*\n*Cutting off life and death, his body became adamantine,*\n*Manifesting or concealing, he transformed without fixed form.*\n\n*He saved the dying, revived the skeletal,*\n*How could a divine immortal take lives wantonly?*\n*Wild foxes craftily deceive the foolish and vulgar,*\n*Yet how could the phoenix of cinnabar resent the black hawk’s startlement?*\n\n*It subdues heavenly demons, tames heretics,*\n*Sweeping away ten thousand dharmas and a thousand gates with a single stroke.*\n*Its worth is priceless in pacifying the world,*\n*A treasure of boundless virtue, purifying the cosmos.*\n\n*This treasure sword ever accompanies the body,*\n*Concealed in use, revealed in benevolence, its edge absolute.*\n*Like flawless jade, its brilliance gleams,*\n*Clear as crystal, without a speck of dust.*\n\n*Within this treasure sword, the void abides,*\n*Personally bestowed by the Supreme upon the hand of Donghua.*\n*Secretly transmitted by the myriad ancestors and immortals,*\n*Obtained, its wisdom shines like the stars.*\n\n*Brandished like golden lightning, pressed like a jade dragon,*\n*It moves freely, manifesting the six penetrations.*\n*Its snow-bright blade glows within the primordial extreme,*\n*Its frost-sharp edge gleams in the Great Void.*\n\n*It pacifies the world, orders the nation,*\n*With a casual lift, the world is cleansed and solemn.*\n*The loyal, worthy, and sagely all submit,*\n*While the treacherous, rebellious, and perverse are all cut down.*\n\n*The buddhas, ancestors, and host of immortals,*\n*Without this sword, the Dao cannot be accomplished.*\n*It excises human desire to fulfill heavenly principle,*\n*Sweeping away the winds and clouds to ascend the Great Clarity.\"*\n\nHere ends the second scroll of *The Wondrous Records of the Divine Transformations of the Imperial Lord of Pure Yang*.\n\nHere begins the third scroll of *The Wondrous Records of the Divine Transformations of the Imperial Lord of Pure Yang*.",

If you can still the heart and rest the *qi*, rest the *qi* and congeal the spirit, so that *qi* and spirit merge as one, heart and nature share a single source, and a body exists beyond the body—then the corporeal form becomes the Jade Void. All these many discussions are but clouds obscuring the vast sky, dust on the mirror, or wind upon the water. You must suddenly awaken and vigorously practice, and all will naturally unfold.\"\n\nThe Perfected One bowed in gratitude.",

      "translated_text": "Here begins the compilation of poetic imagery for the Gate of Mystery, corrected and arranged by Miao Shanshi.\n\n**The Eighth Transformation: Reclusion at Huafeng**\n\nAfter Master Zhengyang transmitted the oral instructions to the Imperial Lord, expounded the *Method of the Wisdom Sword* to dispel all doubts, he declared: *\"The feathered transcendents of the Ten Isles shall ascend to the Jade Capital—my audience with the Primordial has its appointed time. You may find it difficult to remain here long; go instead to the Feathered Valley of Huafeng to cultivate and await the hour. When the moment is ripe, you too shall respond to conditions and benefit beings. When your merit is complete and your work fulfilled, we shall meet again.\"*\n\nThereupon, at the mouth of the grotto, he inscribed these lines:\n*The spring qi fills the void, petals dripping dew,*\n*The morning sun strikes the sea as clouds return to the peaks.*\n\nHe further admonished: *\"After I depart, dwell well among mortals. When your merit and virtue are perfected, you too shall ascend to the Jade Void as I have.\"*\n\nThe Imperial Lord bowed twice and replied: *\"This disciple’s aspiration differs from yours, Master. I must first deliver all sentient beings in the world—only then will my ascent not be too late.\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"Strive on, young one. Though your heart is truly compassionate, the karmic conditions of beings are light, while their deeds are heavy. Of those you deliver henceforth, five hundred disciples shall follow, but only three to five shall inherit my Dao lineage. Until we meet again by chance, cherish and treasure this transmission.\"*\n\nWith these words, he departed with the two immortals, Shi Taiyu and Zheng Siyuan, riding upon a cloud-borne golden canopy and jade scepter, their feathered banners and immortal music ascending gently into the distance. The Imperial Lord, overcome with longing, then retreated to the Feathered Valley of Huafeng, where amid verdant forests and limpid springs, he herded and cultivated for over forty years, perfecting the fruit of the Dao.\n\nThus, Master Yong wrote in his stele inscription: *\"For over forty years, he dwelt in seclusion in the Feathered Valley of Huayin.\"* The *Daoist Canon*’s *Elixir Instructions of the Azure Lad Emperor* records that in the Tang dynasty, the presented scholar Lü Dongbin was enticed by Zhongli Quan with the mysteries of the Dao and received the method of refining the golden elixir to transmute form. Later, residing on Huafeng of Zhongnan, he completed his cultivation, his form and spirit both wondrous, his divine transformations unfathomable. Li Qi, who served as a gentleman of the Imperial Archives during the Xiangfu era, once witnessed Lü Dongbin in Guanzhong wielding the *Divine Sword Method*; though over a hundred years old, his countenance was that of an infant, and his steps swift as flight. Thereafter, he appeared and vanished at will, wandering through Hunan, Hubei, E’zhou, and Mount Lu, his whereabouts unknown even to himself, his movements beyond the ken of gods and spirits.\n\nThe *Illustrated Guide to Cultivating the Mysterious* records that he passed through Jiangzhou, ascended Yellow Crane Tower in Wuchang, and on the twentieth day of the fifth month at noon, transformed into a three-tiered crimson tower and ascended. He left behind this poem:\n*The magic fungus has no seed nor root,*\n*Yet knows to drink and eat, reviving the soul.*\n*So long as mist and rosy clouds sustain the years,*\n*Let the crow and hare race through the cosmos.*\n*The infant clings only to the mother in yang,*\n*The old woman must face the honored one atop the head.*\n*With virtue unwavering through a thousand ages,*\n*No tomb shall mark this lineage for descendants.*\n\nThe assembled stanzas declare: *\"The divine transformations of the sagely immortal defy constancy in dwelling; his traces are untraceable, hence his concealments and manifestations elude all knowledge. In some regions, temples, abbeys, and official monasteries stand, and mountains and rivers bear traces of his manifestations. Yet those who would erect steles and records often fail to find the right person. Moreover, some claim his name without substance, their shallow knowledge and partial glimpses failing to distinguish truth from falsehood. Others falsely attribute deeds to the Imperial Lord to lend credence to their tales—such as *The Pavilion Overlooking the River*, which claims he concealed his name, fearing recognition. How could one who transforms appearance and form beyond measure ever proclaim his own identity? Such errors propagate, and from these examples, the foolish may infer the rest. Thus, I have dared, though unworthy, to consult histories, classics, and collections, verifying facts to arrange and compile this record. May those who embody the Dao’s aspiration find their doubts resolved hereafter.\"*\n\nHis ascent upon the three-tiered crimson tower was but another divine transformation. Alas, the era was not recorded—only the poem remains.\n\n**The Ninth Transformation: Receiving the Luminous Seal**\n\nThe Imperial Lord of Pure Yang held his aspirations lofty, refusing service to kings and marquises. Transcending the mundane, he soared beyond the material world. Thus, none in the realm dared claim him as subject, nor could princes befriend him. After parting from his master, he concealed himself in the Feathered Valley of Huafeng for over forty years. Only in the late Tang did people come to know of him. He later revealed himself to Li Qi, who lived to one hundred and fifty before passing. Lü delivered over a hundred immortals, his appearances and names ever-changing.\n\nDuring the Five Dynasties period, he again concealed himself on Mount Hua, styling himself the *Palace of Primordial Harmony*, donning a hempen robe—hence the name *Hemp-Robed Daoist*. He expounded the principles of the *Book of Changes* and the *Triplex Unity* to enlighten Master Chen Xiyi, as well as Liu Xuanying, the Duke of Yan—later the *Imperial Lord of the Sea Toad*—both of whom became his disciples. The *Imperial Lord of the Sea Toad* first encountered Master Zhengyang, who revealed the peril of piled eggs, prompting his sudden awakening to the Dao. Later, he concealed himself on Mount Hua to cultivate and verify the truth.\n\nThe Imperial Lord of Pure Yang composed the *Heart of the Changes* and transmitted it to Master Xiyi—this is the *Heart of the Changes of the Hemp-Robed Master* now circulating in the world. He also composed three scrolls of *Secret Instructions of the Immortal Lineage* and transmitted them to Liu, the *Imperial Lord of the Sea Toad*. Today, in the Gate of Mystery, the transmission of the Dao flows heart to heart, secretly imparted and received, preserved in the *Precious Record of the Golden Lotus*.\n\nAt the beginning of the Song dynasty, he departed Mount Hua and left this poem for Master Xiyi:\n*A path through azure skies sees few travelers;*\n*Lament not the rise and fall of worldly affairs.*\n*Though the golden roster bears no surname,*\n*The Jade Capital yet cherishes an immortal’s name.*\n*Clouds return to the vast sea, dragons of a thousand years;*\n*Snow fills the endless sky, a crane’s lone cry.*\n\nLater, moved by gratitude, he added:\n*I thank the enlightened sage-kings of this luminous dynasty,*\n*Who repeatedly issued vermilion edicts to summon the Master.*\n\nIndeed, the founding emperors Taizu and Taizong thrice issued summons to him. Later, he returned to Huafeng, only to find Master Xiyi already ascended. He then left this poem:\n*The heavenly net is vast, yet how could it be loose?*\n*For you, I hasten to the precincts of Mount Hua.*\n*After the cold stars fade, a waning moon remains;*\n*As spring snow arrives, I inquire of the Great Void.*\n*Three Grotto Realized Ones return to the Purple Palace;*\n*A thousand-year-old crane transforms into a verdant wutong.*\n*Since parting from you, Master,*\n*Few true men walk the four quarters.*\n\nThe *Imagery and Stanzas* record: *\"The Realized One transmitted the mysteries of the *Changes* and the *Heart of the Changes* to Master Xiyi, who later transmitted them to Shenguang. Shenguang transmitted them to Mu Xiu, Mu Xiu to Zhou Lianxi, Zhou to the two Chengs, and the Chengs to Wen and Sima Guang.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Sea Toad Emperor received the *Changes* and elucidated the Dao of immortality, later transmitting it southward to Zhang Ziyang. Zhang composed the *Triplex Unity of the Zhou Changes*. He passed it to Shi Taizhi, and after three transmissions it reached Zhuge Yuchan, then two more transmissions brought it to Master Li Yuansu of Qing’an. To the north, he transmitted it to Emperor Chongyang Wang, who used the mysteries of the *Changes* and the River Chart and Luo Writ to divide the teachings into the Ten Transformations of Li and the Seven Perfected of Danyang. Later, golden lotuses bloomed by the myriad, jade trees flourished by the thousand, and successors never lacked. All traced their lineage to the residual grace of Emperor Chunyang.\n\nDuring the Five Dynasties, Li Shouzheng rebelled and occupied Hezhong Prefecture. Emperor Taizu of Zhou personally led the campaign, accompanied by Emperor Taizu of Song and Emperor Shizong of Zhou, to besiege the city. Master Clad-in-Hemp and King Zhao Han observed from afar, saying, “How could Minister Li endure long?” King Han asked why. The master replied, “Beyond the city walls, three imperial qi arise.” Soon after, the city fell.\n\nAnother account: Qian Ruoshui, Duke Wenxi, possessed a spirit of refined purity. Master Xiyi deemed him fit to study immortality, but upon closer inspection, he asked the Perfected One to assess him. The master said, “He lacks the bone of immortality—he may only become a noble minister.” Both prophecies came to pass, and thus they were recorded.\n\n**The Tenth Transformation: Divine Response to Emperors**\nIn the second year of Jianlong during the reign of Emperor Shenwu of Song, the emperor sat in repose at the Dragon Pavilion in the imperial gardens when he suddenly saw a feather-clad immortal approaching from the southeast. Startled, the emperor rose to greet him, bowing and inviting him to sit. He asked the immortal whence he came. The reply: “From Mount Penglai.” When asked his name, the Immortal Lord traced two circles in the air and said, “Your Majesty is Zhu Ling—does the Celestial Emperor still recall?” The emperor fell silent. The Immortal Lord continued, “You shall flourish the realm with the virtue of fire. The realm will be pacified without toil—let this ease your sagely concerns. Refrain from slaughter, govern with non-action and purity, and all will endure.” After some time, the emperor could only nod in assent. The rest of their discourse remained secret.\n\nThe emperor ordered attendants to bring wine and fruit, but the Immortal Lord declined. The emperor hastily removed his jade belt and cinnabar robe to bestow upon him. The Immortal Lord smiled, then vanished into the void. The emperor realized: “It was Lord Lü.” He commanded his likeness be painted and enshrined in the Hall of Supreme Purity. Chen Jingyuan of the Left Street Daoist Registry transmitted his image to the world. Later, what Teng Zijin witnessed was nearly identical.\n\n**Poetic Imagery:**\nFive Dynasties rose and fell in fifty years,\nHeaven raised a hero to settle mountains and streams.\nThe Perfected One respectfully admonished with purity,\nThe sagely lord truly embraced nature’s decree.\nJade belt and cinnabar robe—imperial splendor,\nBlue kerchief and crane cloak—Daoist mystery.\nWith a fleeting smile, whither did he return?\nTurning back, clouds soared beyond the heavens.\n\n**The Eleventh Transformation: Seeking Tea at the Stone Shop**\nAt the end of Later Zhou, in Bianjing, a family named Shi ran a tea shop. Their daughter, still young, served tea with grace. The Emperor Lord disguised himself as a beggar, visiting daily to sit in the honored seat and demand tea. His clothes were tattered, his flesh filthy with grime—scarcely approachable. The girl harbored no disgust, instead serving him the finest tea. Her parents, enraged, beat her, yet she treated the Emperor Lord even better.\n\nAfter a month, the Emperor Lord asked, “Could you drink the dregs of my tea?” The girl, finding it too foul to swallow, poured it onto the ground. Suddenly, an extraordinary fragrance arose. She hastily licked it, and her spirit felt refreshed. The Emperor Lord said, “I am Master Lü, no beggar. I regret you did not finish my leavings. Yet do you wish for wealth, nobility, or longevity?” The girl replied, “I am but a humble girl—what do I know of nobility? Wealth and longevity would suffice.”\n\nThe Emperor Lord departed and never returned. Later, the girl married a battalion commander. Eventually, she became the wet nurse to a grandson of King Wu of Wu, who happened to be the uncle of Empress Xuanren Shenglie. She received the fief of Yangmu and lived to one hundred thirty-five before passing.\n\n**Poetic Imagery:**\nLu Tong’s seven bowls—why praise them so?\nA gauze hat and tattered cloak—what’s there to boast?\nMy ancestor’s dragon’s breath now unfurls,\nSuddenly, golden blossoms sprout across the earth.",

Above the pools stood an ancient tree, its branches and trunk withered, overgrown with creeping vines.\n\nAs the Emperor Lord passed by, a figure descended from the treetop and bowed, saying, “I am the spirit of this pine. Fortunate to meet you, Master, I beg for deliverance.”\n\nThe Emperor Lord replied, “You are a demonic sprite—how could I speak to you of the Dao? Yet have you ever accrued hidden virtue?”\n\nThe spirit answered, “The two pythons in the pools have repeatedly harmed people. I, Shi Bailong, have often transformed into a man standing in the water to warn people away, saving hundreds of lives.”\n\nThe pythons emerged, and the Emperor Lord transformed them into swords, sinking them into the spring.\n\n**Poem by the Emperor Lord:**\nAlone I walk, alone I sit,\nIn this world, no one knows me.\nOnly the old tree spirit of Southern Mountain\nClearly recognizes a transcendent passing by.\n\nToday, before the Baling Hermitage, one withered old trunk stands dead, while a single branch beside it thrives—such is the power of divine elixir. The tree is called the \"Young Pine.\" Another massive stone, ink-black in appearance, remains where the Emperor Lord transformed it.\n\n**Poem:**\nA true immortal moves and rests with the times,\nHis spirit concealed—who sees me?\nKnowing the old tree saved many lives,\nHe leisurely passed by the pool.\nA single grain of the great elixir, wielded with a wave,\nShattered two giant pythons like wind.\nBeneath Lü’s Pavilion, traces endure,\nHis mighty virtue unmarred through the ages.\n\n**The Thirteenth Transformation: The Salvation of Guo Xian**\nGuo Shang’ao was the reborn form of the old tree spirit. One day, the Emperor Lord disguised himself as a beggar, his face filthy, his robes tattered, his sores oozing. Daily, he came to sip tea without paying a single coin. Those who sought tea covered their noses and left; for months, no one served him.\n\nGuo Yuan grew displeased but prepared finer tea to offer him. The Emperor Lord said, “You are teachable. I am Lü Gong. Your past life was as the old tree spirit—do you recall?”\n\nGuo was suddenly awakened, as if from a dream, and said, “Fortunate to meet you, Master, I beg you to teach me the Dao.”\n\nThe Emperor Lord replied, “If you wish to learn the Dao, fear not life and death. You must receive this sword.” Guo assented. The Emperor Lord raised his sword toward Guo’s head; Guo cried out, and the Emperor Lord vanished in an instant.\n\nDisheartened, Guo wandered thereafter as a cloud-water monk. One day, he unexpectedly encountered the Emperor Lord and attained the Dao.\n\nLater, Magistrate Zhao of Cizhou honored him. Guo said to Magistrate Zhao, “Tomorrow at noon, I shall depart. Prepare a small coffin with an opening at the head, and thread a bamboo pole through it.”\n\nZhao agreed. The next day at noon, Guo sat and passed away. Zhao followed his instructions, burying him on the riverbank, piercing the opening with a bamboo pole, and piling stones to protect it. When autumn rains swelled the river, Zhao exhumed the coffin—only tattered cotton and no corpse remained.\n\n**Poem:**\nThe tree spirit’s past life accrued hidden merit,\nReborn as a man, he hid in the marketplace.\nA single sword cut through the dust of this life,\nYears of Dharma rain connected past and present.\nWorldly passions extinguished, his heart boundless,\nHis celestial nature radiant, his body vast as the void.\nWhy manifest again in a coffin, grotesque and crude?\nHe left traces to inspire his lineage.\n\n**The Fourteenth Transformation: The Audience with Zhong Ruoweng**\nZhong Chuan, Military Commissioner of Pingdong, was called Ruoweng. The Emperor Lord, wearing a headscarf and white robe, sought an audience with him, leading a young cowherd who held a yellow calf in the courtyard.\n\nRuoweng marveled at his profound and expansive bearing, his graceful demeanor. Pointing to the cowherd, he said, “This Daoist is skilled in poetry—can he compose a verse on this scene?”\n\nThe Emperor Lord replied, “No need for my words—this boy can do it himself.” The cowherd wrote in large characters:\n*Grass carpets the wilds for six or seven li,\nA flute plays three or four notes in the evening breeze.\nReturning well-fed at dusk,\nHe sleeps under the moon, straw cloak still on.*\n\nAfter parting, people saw him carrying two large jars, singing loudly as he left the city. Someone reported to Ruoweng, “The jars had two mouths—this was Lü Gong!”\n\nRuoweng hastily pursued him but saw him no more. Today, those who preserve his calligraphy find it imbued with the bearing of soaring luan and phoenix—truly, no ordinary man could achieve such.",

      "translated_text": "Duke Cao of the State scorned wealth and honor, yearning instead for purity and emptiness. By the age of twelve or thirteen, he had mastered the Three Teachings and their scriptures at a single glance. From childhood, he frequented the imperial palace, where the emperor and empress alike cherished and revered him. Whenever the emperor conversed with him, he spoke only of stillness, spontaneity, and the primal qi as the foundation of governance. The emperor, greatly pleased, once bestowed upon him a yellow robe with red sashes, but Cao merely bowed in gratitude and declined. One day, he took leave of the emperor and empress. When asked where he was bound, he replied, \"A Daoist’s home is wherever the mind wanders; his heart roams the four seas.\" The emperor and empress repeatedly urged him to stay, offering saddled horses and attendants, but he refused all. The emperor then presented him with a golden tablet, inscribed: *Wherever the Duke of the State goes, it is as if We Ourselves are present.* Soon after, he vanished for days at a time, living only by begging with a basket and exchanging alms for sustenance.\n\nOnce, at a Yellow River ferry crossing, the boatman demanded passage money. Cao said, \"I am a Daoist; I have no coin.\" The boatman cursed and drove him away, so Cao drew the golden tablet from his robe to cover the fare. When the passengers saw the imperial inscription, they cried, \"Long live the Emperor!\" The boatman, terrified, prostrated himself. Then, an emaciated Daoist seated in the boat shouted, \"You have left the world—how dare you rely on power to intimidate others?\" Cao bowed deeply and replied, \"Disciple, disciple—how could I presume such a thing?\" The Daoist asked, \"Can you cast it into the water?\" Without hesitation, Cao hurled the tablet into the depths. The crowd gasped and bowed in awe. The Daoist called Cao ashore, saying, \"Come with me.\" Cao agreed, and they disembarked together.\n\nAfter walking several li, they rested beneath a great tree. The Daoist asked, \"Have you ever met Dongbin?\" Cao replied, \"This humble one is but a mortal—how could I know an immortal?\" The Daoist sighed and said, \"I am he, and I have come specifically to guide you.\" Cao bowed again, and they journeyed on. Dongbin transmitted to him the wondrous oral formulas of the Dao, enabling him to cultivate and attain the fruit of immortality. His *Collected Writings of the Immortal* are said to have been passed down to the world.\n\n**Poetic Reflection:**\n*Beyond worldly things, his nature pure and true,\nHis spirit soared, his qi untainted, bright.\nWith eyes that spanned the seas, desire he overthrew,\nHis heart embraced the Three Powers, free of dust’s blight.\nThe golden tablet bestowed—he smiled but once,\nHis master’s secret transmission brought eternal spring.\nFrom green-clad father’s virtue, Tang’s grace did spring,\nOne empress, two immortals—such was heaven’s design.*\n\n**The Eighteenth Transformation: Immortal Lady Cao**\nAccording to *The Transmission of Immortal Lady Cao*, when Emperor Pure Yang was traveling through an ancient temple in Henan, a monk who had entered nirvana appeared faintly before him in the dead of night and bowed. The Emperor questioned him, and the monk replied, \"I was once the abbot of this temple, renowned for my swift and incisive responses in debate.\" The Emperor said, \"Alas, you are but a yin spirit now.\" The monk sighed and asked, \"Why do you say so?\" The Emperor replied, \"I, Pure Yang, respond to circumstances with effortless adaptability—all can see this. How could you compare?\" The monk, doubtful, pressed further. The Emperor said, \"If you do not believe me, tonight a certain household will hold a vegetarian feast. Let us both attend—what say you?\" The monk agreed, and they proceeded to the feast. The host welcomed them and seated them, soon serving a portion of the meal. The Emperor said, \"There are two of us—bring another portion.\" The host complied, and after the Emperor finished eating and rose to express his thanks, the monk had only inhaled the steam. The host asked, \"Sir, I prepared two portions as you instructed—where is the other guest?\" The Emperor feigned ignorance: \"I know not what became of him; he never arrived.\" They departed, and the monk, suddenly enlightened, bowed again and begged for instruction. The Emperor said, \"To achieve the fusion of nature and life, the perfection of form and spirit, one must refine the primal qi inherited from one’s parents. You must return to the human realm for a time.\" The monk said, \"I fear I will lose my way again.\" The Emperor replied, \"I will guide you myself.\" He then directed the monk to be reborn, and the monk’s thoughts instantly entered the capital, where he merged with Empress Cao’s womb and was conceived as a girl.\n\nFrom afar, the Emperor foresaw that she would struggle to escape the bonds of wealth and nobility, so he shrouded her form in darkness and ugliness. On the third day after her birth, the empress, fearing the emperor’s displeasure, sent her to be raised by her maternal grandmother. As she grew, her appearance remained homely, and she took up the hairpin and sash of a Daoist nun. Later, the Emperor Pure Yang came to awaken her, and Immortal Lady Cao instantly attained enlightenment. She burned incense, bowed, and sought the wondrous teachings of the Dao. The Emperor transmitted to her the secret mysteries of the Mysterious Pass, enabling her to cultivate and perfect both nature and life. Thereafter, her brush flowed effortlessly into prose and verse, and her recorded sayings and poems circulate in the world to this day.\n\n**Poetic Reflection:**\n*Illuminating the mind, perceiving nature—her learning was whole,\nYet she grasped nothing, for all was empty, free.\nA hundred years, ten thousand transformations—already void,\nWhere could that single spark of spirit find its home?\nNature and life merged, her body vast as space,\nForm and spirit fused, she soared beyond the heavens’ gate.\nHad Immortal Lady not met her true teacher,\nHow could she have realized true emptiness and roamed the azure skies?*\n\n**The Nineteenth Transformation: Immortal Lady He**\nImmortal Lady He was a Daoist maiden from Lingling. At thirteen, she followed her companions into the mountains to gather medicinal herbs and tea. Suddenly, she lost her way and wandered alone, unable to find the path home. At the foot of a mountain peak, she saw a man with a long beard and piercing eyes, wearing a tall hat and a green robe—it was Emperor Pure Yang. Immortal Lady He hurriedly prostrated herself before him. The Emperor produced a peach and said, \"You are young and fond of fruit—eat this entirely, and one day you will ascend to the heavens. If not, you will remain earthbound.\" She managed to eat half, and the bearded man pointed out the way home. When she returned, she believed only a day had passed, but in truth, a month had gone by. From then on, she neither hungered nor fell ill, and she gained profound insight into the fortunes and misfortunes of others. Later, she departed through *shi jie*.\n\nThe Emperor once told Immortal Lady He, \"I once wandered through the Huayin market selling medicine. I placed a single elixir among ten thousand pills, and when seekers came, I would reach into the gourd and draw one out at random to observe their karmic affinity.\"\n\n*Records of the Wondrous Transformations of Emperor Pure Yang, Volume Three—End*\n*Records of the Wondrous Transformations of Emperor Pure Yang, Volume Four*",

Presently, a young novice emerged, and the Emperor asked, “Why so empty here?”\nThe novice replied, “Do not say it is empty—even the void cannot contain it.”\nPleased with his answer, the Emperor inscribed a poem on the wall:\n*Jin’e’s gate stands open, unlocked,*\n*Yet a barefoot immortal boy appears.*\n*I ask why the abbot’s hall is so desolate—*\n*He answers, “Even the void cannot contain it.”*\nHearing this, the Emperor smiled with delight, thinking, *How could the master here be an ordinary man?*\n*I came to pay my respects but could not meet him;*\n*My parched heart burns with dust-laden longing.*\n*As I depart, the waves stretch boundless,*\n*The path leads to Penglai, its mountains veiled in mist.*\n*My yearning ascends with my elder brother on Stone Tower,*\n*Where snow clears over the sea and a thousand peaks dawn.*\n\n**Poetic Vision:**\n*The cavern’s gate opens and shuts without lock or key,*\n*Emerging and returning—why move the feet?*\n*Forgetting both motion and stillness, unbound by all,*\n*The body’s samādhi is wholly unattached.*\n*No praise, no anger, no joy or delight,*\n*No deceit, no delusion—one with all beings.*\n*The celestial nature is pure and solemn, without the slightest blemish;*\n*The sacred realm is empty and tranquil, free of even a speck of dust.*\n*The boundless bitter sea stretches endlessly vast,*\n*Finite time fades into dark obscurity.*\n*Stone Tower shatters as the snow begins to clear—*\n*How many dawns remain in this quiet, solitary light?*\n\n**Twenty-Sixth Transformation**\n**Twenty-Seventh Transformation**\n**Twenty-Eighth Transformation**\n**Twenty-Ninth Transformation**\n**Thirtieth Transformation**\n**Thirty-First Transformation**\n**Thirty-Second Transformation**\n**Thirty-Third Transformation**\n*(The above entries were originally missing.)*\n\n**Thirty-Fourth Transformation: The Daoist Seal of Kangjie**\nMaster Kangjie, Shao Yong, styled Yaofu, was once seated in meditation when suddenly an extraordinary fragrance filled the room, and his mind became luminously clear. He cast a divination and obtained the *dui* trigram, representing the mouth. Doubled, it formed two mouths, and he said, “Master Lü has arrived.”\nHe hastily arranged his desk and set up a spirit tablet for the Perfected Lord Pure Yang, waiting respectfully. After some time, his servant announced a Daoist at the gate seeking an audience. Yong hurried out to bow and welcome him into the hall. The Perfected One sat in the place of honor and overturned the tablet, asking, “How did you know I was coming?”\nYong truthfully recounted the earlier signs. The Perfected One said, “Since you knew I was coming, you must also know where I am going. Where am I bound now?”\nYong, at a loss, could not answer. He bowed again and offered wine and fruit, earnestly entreating instruction. The Perfected One said, “Just now, when my thought stirred, you knew it. When I am quiescent, you are bewildered and at a loss.”\nYong suddenly awakened and bowed again. The Perfected One stopped him, saying, “What insight have you gained that you thank me?”\nYong replied, *“Before a single thought arises, even spirits and gods cannot know it. If not by me, then by whom?”*\nThe Perfected One said, “This is the principle of inherent nature, but the wisdom of true emptiness and the life of the spirit remain ungrasped.”\nYong bowed again and knelt thrice, saying, “I beg you to enlighten my dullness.”\nThe Perfected One said, “Mencius spoke of nurturing the vast and unyielding with integrity, calling it ‘hard to explain.’ It is not that it is hard to explain, but that one has not found the right person. Your virtue has long been profound, and you have accumulated much hidden merit. That is why I have come to guide you. You have just glimpsed the edge of the nature of reality—how could I bear not to transmit it to you? Yet though your nature is clear and bright, your karmic burdens remain unexhausted.”\nYong bowed repeatedly, entreating again and again, until the Perfected One imparted the oral transmission. After bowing in gratitude, Yong offered more wine, and they drank deeply until dusk, when the Perfected One vanished like the wind. An extraordinary fragrance lingered in the household for half a month.\nFrom then on, Yaofu seldom ventured out, withdrawing from worldly affairs to nurture his vast nature and delight in heaven. Later, his practice grew ever more refined, and he composed a poem:\n*At the winter solstice, midnight’s half,*\n*The heart of heaven remains unchanged.*\n*Where the single yang first stirs,*\n*All things are yet unborn.*\n*The wine of mystery tastes faint,*\n*The great sound is scarcely heard.*\n*If you doubt these words,*\n*Ask Fuxi again.*\n\n**Thirty-Fifth Transformation: The Divine Warning of Lord Chen**\nLord Chen Zhizhong built a grand estate in the capital and hosted a grand feast, gathering relatives and friends for revelry. Though Chen had long followed the Dao and harmonized his *qi* with virtue, a ragged Daoist—none other than Lü Dongbin—appeared and asked, “What skills do you possess?”\nThe Daoist replied, “I have a set of immortal music. Would you like me to perform it to grace your feast?”\nFrom his sleeve, he produced a scroll of paintings, which he hung on a pillar. It depicted twelve immortal maidens, each holding a musical instrument. The Daoist called to them as if they were real, and they lined up before him. Two maidens bearing ceremonial banners led the way, while the others played their instruments. All were fair as jade and flowers, their beauty and voices enchanting. They wore seven-jeweled crowns and six-ounce robes, their golden pendants and jade ornaments chiming softly as they moved. On each maiden’s nose was a grain of yellow jade, yet their forms were ethereal, unlike living beings. Their music soared clear and bright to the heavens, its melodies unlike anything heard before.\nAfter three pieces, Chen asked, “What sort of women are these?”\nThe Daoist replied, “These are the Jade Maidens of the Six Jia and Six Ding. When one cultivates the Dao to perfection, the three *hun* souls, seven *po* souls, five viscera, and six bowels within the body all transform into such beings. Would you like to learn?”\nChen, deeming it mere illusion, was displeased. The Daoist turned to the maidens and said, “You may go,” and they all returned to the scroll. The Daoist then took the scroll, opened his mouth, and swallowed it. He asked for paper and brush and wrote boldly:\n*I have endured three thousand kalpas in heaven,*\n*And five hundred years among men.*\n*My waist’s sword flashes like purple lightning,*\n*My crucible’s elixir flames rise in azure smoke.*\n*Now riding a white deer across the sea,*\n*Now straddling a green ox into the grotto-heaven.*\n*Such minor arts are but trifles to amuse—*\n*Who among mortals knows I am an immortal?*\nAt the end, he signed: *Inscribed by the Valley Guest.*\nThen he departed, vanishing in an instant. Chen realized the Valley Guest was Lü Dongbin and, filled with remorse, wished to tear out his eyes. Soon after, he passed away.\n\n**Thirty-Sixth Transformation: The Divine Inquiry of Master Xu**\nXu Shenweng of Hailing had attained the Dao and could foresee the fortunes and misfortunes of others. His home was always filled with guests. When Lü Huiqing came to visit, a Daoist was already seated in the place of honor and refused to rise, even hurling insults at Huiqing.",

The third: *two mouths* (两口) is ‘Lü’ (吕). The fourth: *singing* (歌) is ‘ling’ (昤). The one who composed this poem must be Lü Dongbin.”\n\n**Thirty-Eighth Transformation: The Healing of Teng Zhong’s Affliction**\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, in the Eastern Capital, a Daoist calling himself the Valley Guest drank with the commoner Teng Zhong. As he prepared to leave, he bequeathed a single pill to Teng. Teng suffered from a chronic ailment and had vowed to fast and seek the Dao, hoping to meet a true immortal who might grant him medicine. Upon taking the pill, he was instantly cured. Two years later, they encountered each other again across the water at the eastern side of the Open Bright Bridge in Yangzhou. The Guest sat by the water’s edge and beckoned; Teng took the path and crossed the bridge’s pillar to reach him. Upon arrival, the figure he had seen before was nowhere to be found. Only then did he realize it had been Lü Dongbin. Overcome with disappointment, he feigned madness and soon after passed away.\n\n**Thirty-Ninth Transformation: The Transcendence of Chen Xuande**\nXuande—whose surname was Chen—once encountered the Lord of the Dao, who bestowed upon him the *Great-Soled Divine Elixir*. It allowed him to run swiftly and never age. He composed two *ci* poems. The first:\n\n*In refining, the center divides;*\n*The ministerial fire is upheld.*\n*Externally, square shoes lend aid—*\n*Pure emptiness, clarity, and mastery reign.*\n*(Sixteen characters missing from the original.)*\n*The numinous treasure forms the embryo,*\n*The ten directions’ primordial extremity.*\n*When the supremely true arrives,*\n*In the dim and indistinct, mushroom cakes and feathered canopies appear.*\n\nThe second:\n\n*A day of pure joy—*\n*Where has it gone in ten years?*\n*Old affairs taken up anew,*\n*A gentle breeze, slanting sun arrive in Jiangnan.*\n*Spring fills the level lake with shimmering beauty.*\n*In hand, a yellow slip—*\n*Dragon script inscribed.*\n*Before the green carriage, phoenix glue and jade kings are harnessed.*\n*The Record of Purity and Truth is signed,*\n*With an immortal’s title.*\n*Offices are listed in the Numinous Terrace’s Book of Scribes.*\n\nLater, Xuande departed through *shijie* (corpse liberation).\n\n**Fortieth Transformation: The Divine Portrait**\nThe Lord of the Dao wandered to Shanyang’s Divine Radiance Abbey and, begging a brush, painted his own likeness on the northern wall of the Three Clarities Hall. His brows and eyes were finely wrought, his appearance ancient and strange—unlike any commonly transmitted image.

The characters were written backward on a wooden beam, and though scraped, they would not fade.\n\n**Forty-Second Transformation: The Ordination of a Monk in the Jingde Era**\nAt Emei Courtyard within Jingde Temple in the Eastern Capital, a monk from Shu arrived to serve as abbot, known as the Emei Daoist. His precepts were strict, and for twenty years, he never left his abbot’s quarters. One day, a strange figure—clad in a blue headscarf and white robe—arrived. The Daoist treated him with great courtesy. The visitor spoke with him arrogantly until midnight before departing, promising to return on the same day the following year. The attendant monks all witnessed this. The next year, at noon on the appointed day, the Daoist bathed, sat, and passed away. By evening, the strange figure returned, sighing endlessly, then vanished without a trace. The following day, on the highest point of the wall beside the hall, characters were found written in a soaring, dynamic script—like a dancing phoenix or soaring luan. The poem read:\n\n*The sun sets, the west wind slants,*\n*Tonight, my old friend departs.*\n*To come or not—why leave me waiting,*\n*Standing till the wutong’s shadow fades?*\n\nA small inscription read *Tong Xing Zuo* (同省作), concealing the characters *Dongbin* (洞宾) within its strokes.\n\n**Forty-Third Transformation: Wandering the Dayu Ridge**\nAt Dayu Ridge in Hengpu, a wealthy young man, enamored of the Dao, built a hermitage and hosted wandering scholars for many years. One day, as a grand Yellow Register Offering had just concluded, a ragged Daoist priest arrived seeking alms. The crowd, unaware of his worth, treated him with disdain and humiliation. The priest inscribed a *ci* poem on the wall:\n\n*For a time, I wander Hengpu,*\n*Who speaks with the white crane that flies through?*\n*By the ridge’s homestead,*\n*How many winters have seen the plum blossoms bloom?*\n*Spring comes, spring goes,*\n*Man lingers where petals drift on flowing streams.*\n*Flowers fill the path ahead,*\n*Hiding immortals—none know where they tread.*\n\nAt the end, he wrote *Yuan Xin Chang Lao Lai* (元心昌老来). The characters were rendered in three distinct styles. Upon finishing, he entered the cloud hall and did not emerge for a long while. When they searched, he was gone. Examining the writing, they found it had penetrated the wall behind. Only then did they realize *Chang* (昌) and *Yuan Xin* (元心) formed *Lü* (吕)—it was Lord Lü.

Displeased, Han watched as the Lord kneaded the mud from the pit into ink, declaring, \"It is done.\" He then departed. Han slowly retrieved the ink and examined it, only to find it was fine gold. Upon its surface was inscribed the character *Lü*; when split open, the character penetrated its very texture.

One day, as he saw a guest off beyond the Eastern Capital’s gate, he arrived only to find the guest already departed, beyond pursuit. At his lodging, he saw a Daoist adept and, spreading out a mat and wine, invited the adept to share them. When they had finished, the adept raised his cup, scooped water, and wrote the character *Lü* upon the table, saying, \"Next year, we shall meet in Jiangnan.\" Then he vanished in a flutter. Huang then realized it was Lord Dongbin. The following year, Huang was indeed transferred to an office in Jiangnan, where he again met Dongbin. The Lord gave him seven large coins, ten medium ones, and three small ones, saying, \"This number cannot be increased. I shall leave you with a few inches of medicine. On New Year’s Day, grind it with wine and take it—you will be free of illness for a year.\" Huang followed his instructions, and by the age of seventy-three, the medicine was nearly exhausted. He wrote a poem:\n\n*No calendar by my bed,*\n*Counting children on my fingers now.*\n*At seventy-three years old,*\n*He passed away.*\n\n**Forty-Seventh Transformation: The Enlightenment of Physician Li**\nLi Decheng of the Eastern Capital was a skilled physician with a reverent heart for the Dao and great compassion. He often saved the poor and suffering, accumulating hidden virtue. On a bitterly cold day, he encountered a destitute Daoist adept wearing only a single layer of clothing, his face pale with cold. The adept invited Li into a wineshop and took the seat of honor, which Li found strange. The proprietor said, \"Pay for the wine first.\" The adept pointed to three wine jars in the shop and said, \"Each contains a pint of wine money.\" The proprietor did not believe him at first but checked and found it to be true, so he gave them three pints of wine. The adept poured and drank, while Li took only one jar—the other two emptied themselves. The adept said to Li, \"This is but a small art. I am Lü Dongbin.\" Li was astonished and overjoyed. The adept wrote a quatrain:\n\n*The Son of Heaven within the ninefold palace is honored,*\n*The five ranks of nobles beyond are revered.*\n*Yet how can they compare to the carefree commoner,*\n*Who does not entrust his life and fate to Heaven and Earth?*\n\nLi did not grasp its meaning. The adept left him with a single pill, saying, \"Take this, and you shall enjoy long life.\" Then he departed. After taking the pill, Li’s hair did not turn white, his teeth did not fall out, and he lived to the age of one hundred and seven before passing away.\n\n**Forty-Eighth Transformation: The Inscription Left at the Convent**\nWithin the Eastern Capital’s An Yuan Gate stood a convent. The founding master wished to deliver a certain person, but their karmic affinity was shallow, and they did not come.

One day, a Daoist arrived, and the old woman treated him kindly, pleading for her descendants’ sickness. The Daoist said, “Wait for me at dawn tomorrow.” The woman rose early to await him, and he gave her medicine wrapped in crimson gauze. “When the illness strikes, hold this and you will recover,” he instructed. One pellet could cure a hundred people, but once a hundred were healed, it would no longer work. The woman followed his words, and her children and grandchildren were cured.

Had it been one day later, she could not have been cured.” He then bestowed upon him the *Divine Treasure Ointment* formula: take five *gualou* fruits and five pieces of fine frankincense, each the size of a jujube, grind them finely, and simmer with one *jin* of white honey to form a paste. Each dose of three *qian*, dissolved in warm wine, would greatly heal carbuncles, malignant sores, swellings, and fistulas. His mother took it and recovered at once.

He took meals in the Assembly Hall for over a month, then said to the monks, “Your vegetarian fare is excellent, but you lack tea.” He departed, and ten days later returned with a small amount of tea. He prepared it himself in the kitchen, and several hundred monks were sated. Monk Zhiming invited the recluse for tea and recited a poem by Minister Ding: *“Flowers break along the monk’s whisk, clouds follow the guest’s bowl round.”* The recluse said, “The lines are fine, but they do not fully capture the essence of tea.” He then wrote a poem:\n\n*A jade-tipped spear proclaims the rarest grade,*\n*The monk’s craft demands meticulous care.*\n*In shallow hare’s-fur bowls, fragrant clouds gleam white,*\n*In frog-eye brew, snow-like waves rise and float.*\n*It banishes the sleep-demon from desk and mat,*\n*And sharpens the pure qi to refresh flesh and bone.*\n*Delighting in seclusion by the cliffs’ embrace,*\n*It refuses to transplant its roots to the capital’s throne.*\n\nThe monk presented a poem in return:\n*“Seeking truth, I’ve found the true—*\n*Only Master Lü remains.*\n*In my basket, naught but verse,*\n*In my furnace, silver flames.*\n*Your nature, pure as ancient days,*\n*Your spirit, warm as spring’s own rays.*\n*One day on Cloud Bridge’s path,*\n*How might I draw near your way?”*\n\nThe recluse responded:\n*A wanderer three thousand li from home,*\n*A cloud-roving hand for seven hundred years.*\n*When my deeds are full, Penglai becomes my lodge,*\n*When the Dao is perfected, tiles and stones turn gold.*\n*In my wine jar, wine for guests is ever stored,*\n*In my furnace, spring’s alchemy unfolds.*\n*Who fears a lack of teachers when virtue’s sown?*\n*Since ancient times, Heaven and Earth show no favor to kin.*\n\nHe then left the monk a single elixir pellet, saying, “Take this, and you will not die.” He departed, and later the monk too ascended as an immortal.\n\n**Fifty-Second Transformation: The Persuasion of Hou Yonghui**\nLord Dongbin traveled to Jiangzhou’s Mount Lu, to the Simplicity and Quiet Abbey, where he tempered his sword by the steps.

The Dao-sword transcends form, while the method-sword serves as defense.

The method-sword, however, is for defense—and operates differently. It takes spirit as its mother and the blade as its child: where spirit abides, the blade abides; where spirit departs, the blade disperses.

      "translated_text": "**The Fifty-Seventh Transformation: Tempting the Minister**\n\nMinisterial Gentleman Jia Shixiong of the Ministry of Works kept an ancient iron mirror, which he once wished to temper and polish. The Perfected Lord, posing as a wandering guest, paid him a visit. At first, he spoke only of the Dao, but Jia did not comprehend. The next day, the guest begged to test his skill. From his bamboo case, he took a pinch of medicine, placed it on the mirror, and departed, saying: *\"Wait a moment, and I shall return.\"* The medicine’s trace had vanished, but upon the door of the Taiping Temple where he lodged, a poem appeared:\n\n*\"In hand, a green serpent soars beneath the sun,\nWithin the cave, immortal fruits bloom ever bright.\nKnow this: the cloud-wreathed guest beyond the world\nIs not the man who grinds mirrors in the dust.\"*\n\n---\n\n**The Fifty-Eighth Transformation: Tempting Kuang Ruogu**\n\nAt the Hermit’s Abbey on Mount Qingcheng, the Daoist Kuang Ruogu possessed a noble bearing, his precepts and conduct pure and strict. He often used talismanic water from the Heart of Heaven and the Three Luminaries to cure illnesses, with remarkable efficacy. Yet whatever money or silk he received, he immediately distributed to the poor.\n\nThe Perfected Lord, disguising himself as Master Guest, paid him a visit and stayed for over a month. The talismans he drew would often rise into the air, transforming into dragons and serpents that vanished into mist and cloud. When he summoned spirits or generals, their forms would manifest, speaking in human tongues. His feet stamped the earth to raise thunder, his eyes flashed to strike lightning, his breath darkened into clouds, and his spittle scattered into rain.\n\nHe was also skilled in painting without brush or ink—merely holding water in his mouth and spraying it onto silk or paper, whereupon mountains, rivers, flowers, trees, palaces, birds, beasts, and figures would naturally appear, requiring only a light touch to refine. The money he earned from selling these paintings, he spent on wine, drinking deeply with Ruogu. Ruogu, though accustomed to vast quantities of liquor, was always bested by his guest.\n\nOne day, Ruogu asked: *\"Sir, your conduct is unlike that of ordinary men. You must have come from among the immortals. Might you speak to me of the Dao?\"*\n\nThe guest replied: *\"The seven stars of the Northern Dipper are missing one from your left foot. How could you attain the Dao? Another lifetime will be needed.\"*\n\nRuogu was astonished: *\"Master Guest is truly a sage! Beneath my left foot is a black mole shaped like the Northern Dipper, lacking one star—something no one has ever known.\"* He then asked how long he might live.\n\nThe Perfected Lord wrote ninety-four characters in reverse upon the wall, arranging them into two interlocking circles before departing. Only then did Ruogu realize the two circles formed the character *Lü*—his guest’s surname. Later, Ruogu died at the age of ninety-four, fulfilling the reversed writing’s prophecy.\n\n**Poetic Image:**\n*The master refined the mysterious in profound stillness,\nResponding to the moment, his method natural and free.\nRuogu, proud and scornful of the Dao,\nMust wait another life—no path to immortality.*\n\n---\n\n**The Fifty-Ninth Transformation: Delivering the Brush-Maker**\n\nOn Green River, the brush-maker Zhai was fond of hosting wandering adepts. The Perfected Lord visited him, and Zhai lodged him at his home with the utmost courtesy. From then on, they came and went for over a year.\n\nOne day, the Perfected Lord took Zhai boating on the river. He split a brush shaft in two and set the pieces adrift upon the waves. Stepping onto one half, he beckoned Zhai to follow. Terrified, Zhai dared not move, but the Perfected Lord laughed and crossed to the shore. In an instant, he vanished. Only then did Zhai realize he was an extraordinary man.\n\nTen days later, the Perfected Lord returned, bringing food for Zhai—all of it rotten and foul. Zhai pinched his nose and refused to eat. The Perfected Lord sighed: *\"Since you cannot stomach coarse fare, I shall leave you two jars of meat sauce.\"* He departed and was seen no more. When Zhai opened the jars, they were filled with gold flakes—not two great vats, but two small vessels.\n\n**Poetic Image:**\n*For over a year, they came and went, companions true,\nYet Zhai’s virtue was not unaccompanied.\nRefusing the foul food, he spurned the boat’s ascent—\nAlas, his share of immortality slipped away.*\n\n---\n\n**The Sixtieth Transformation: Delivering the Courtesan Huang Ying**\n\nIn Guangling, the courtesan Huang Ying was renowned for her beauty. Wealthy patrons crowded her door, yet she took pleasure in aiding the poor and giving alms. One day, a certain Lü the Scholar—none other than Dongbin—sought lodging. Huang, seeing his shabby and filthy state, turned him away.\n\nThe scholar wrote two poems upon her screen:\n\n*I.*\n*\"Mengmu and Xishi shared this frame,\nYet age and youth stand far apart.\nOne day, a crone with crane-white hair,\nToday, a face like flowers, fair.\"*\n\n*II.*\n*\"Flowers bloom and fade, two joys, two sorrows,\nFlower and mortal share the same fate.\nWhile on the branch, beware the plucking hand,\nFallen to earth, who then will gaze?\"*\n\nWhen he finished writing, he vanished in an instant. Huang, awakened, sought to gouge out her eyes.\n\n**Poetic Image:**\n*Illusion shapes the body, a borrowed shell,\nGreed for wealth and lust for beauty sever true kinship.\nIn action and stillness, speech and silence—who is master?\nWho perceives the lord within the center?*\n\n**And again:**\n*All day, she sold her smiles and chased delight,\nYet how much hidden virtue did she store?\nThe true immortal came to save her soul,\nBut alas, her blessings were too thin to bear.*\n\n---\n\n**The Sixty-First Transformation: Playful Wandering in Yueyang**\n\nThe Perfected Lord wandered to Yueyang, disguising himself as a medicine peddler. He priced each pill at a thousand gold, yet after three days, none were sold. He then ascended Yueyang Tower and consumed his own medicine. Suddenly, he stood suspended in midair. The crowd, startled, longed for his elixir. The Perfected Lord laughed: *\"The Dao lies before your eyes, a step from Penglai’s fields. Yet you grasp the trigger but do not loose the arrow—missing what is right in front of you.\"*\n\nHe then recited a poem:\n*\"At dawn, I roam the northern seas; by dusk, the dark southern woods.\nIn my sleeve, a green serpent—my gall bold as the sun.\nThree days in Yueyang, and none knew me,\nAs I soared, chanting, over Dongting Lake.\"*\n\n**Poetic Image:**\n*The immortal soars like a phoenix perched on wu-tung,\nForgetting both concealment and display, essence and form.\nHis wondrous medicine could deliver men, yet none knew,\nWhile his virtuous breeze swept the river and lake.*\n\n---\n\n**The Sixty-Second Transformation: Saving Supervisor Zhao**\n\nSupervisor Zhao Yingdao of the Bureau of Imperial Regalia fell gravely ill, nearing death. Exhausted, he wept as he bid farewell to his kin: *\"I am dying. Of all the things I possess, I would willingly part with them—save for my white-haired parents, whom I must entrust to you. What is to be done?\"*\n\nBefore he could finish speaking, a Daoist suddenly knocked at the door. He said to Zhao: *\"Your illness is not difficult to cure.\"* He took two sheets of paper, cut a hole in each the size of a plate, and handed them to Zhao: *\"Tonight, burn one sheet, mix the ashes with frankincense-infused water, and apply it to the afflicted area. Keep the other for those who come after.\"*",

On her back, where his hand had struck, the character *Lü* was branded deep into her flesh.\n\nHou, awakened, thought: *\"This is Lord Lü! Had I not erred in a single thought in a past life, would I have come to this? Has he come to deliver me?\"*\n\nShe immediately cut her hair, donned coarse cloth, and sought out Lü Dongbin. Upon meeting again, she received the Dao and vanished, her fate unknown.",

      "translated_text": "As night fell and no one had come to bow, the Daoist went to sit by the fire pit before the Five Manifestations Temple. Children gathered, pelting him with tiles and stones, but the Daoist only smiled and said, *\"The world longs to see me, yet having seen me, they do not recognize me—such is fate.\"* Then he swallowed the elixir himself. Suddenly, five-colored clouds enveloped him, and in an instant, he vanished. The crowd was filled with remorse.\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"A single golden elixir could have bridged the green,\nYet clearly shown, they wove their own illusions.\nThe world’s meager fortune lightly cast aside—\nThey saw the true immortal yet missed the mystery.\"*\n\n**The Sixty-Fifth Transformation: Testing Chen Danran**\n\nChen Danran was a wealthy scholar who admired the Dao. For years, he hosted wandering Daoists, yet none proved worthy. The Perfected Lord disguised himself as a laborer, tending Chen’s garden for over a year. Though he worked twice as hard as others, Chen merely treated him as a hired hand. One day, Chen and a Daoist friend discussed the *Yin Fu Jing*, pausing at the lines: *\"When Heaven unleashes its killing force, dragons and serpents rise from the land; when man unleashes his killing force, Heaven and Earth are overturned.\"* They could not fathom the meaning of \"killing force.\" The laborer interjected loudly: *\"That which gives life does not live; that which brings death does not die. To kill life after it is born, or to learn death before it comes—this is the way to long life.\"* Chen was astonished: *\"You are but a laborer—who taught you such words?\"* When pressed, the man only spoke nonsense, his words incomprehensible. The friend scoffed: *\"Some rustic must have overheard this somewhere—he doesn’t truly understand it.\"* Soon after, the laborer took leave of Chen, saying, *\"I must journey far. I will return on the fifth day of the fifth month next year.\"* He departed without a trace.\n\nLater, a villager of Chen’s, traveling in Baling, encountered the man, who said: *\"Tell Master Chen I am Lü Dongbin. Had he been ready, I would have transmitted the Dao. But I observed him further, and he was not. I will not return.\"* With that, he strode into the bamboo grove before the Lüxian Pavilion and vanished. On the fifth day of the fifth month the following year, at noon, Chen suddenly died.\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"For years he sought the Dao and questioned masters—\nWhy did the true immortal descend in vain?\nHe spoke plainly of life and death’s profound mystery,\nYet Danran remained empty, still empty.\"*\n\n**The Sixty-Sixth Transformation: The Governor’s Chess Match**\n\nThe governor of Wuchang was playing chess one day when an unnamed Daoist approached and declared, *\"I can play.\"* The governor tested him, and after only eight moves, the Daoist said, *\"You have lost.\"* The governor protested: *\"The board is not yet full—how can you know?\"* The Daoist replied: *\"My pieces control the key paths—thus I know.\"* And indeed, the governor lost. After several games, all ending in defeat, the Daoist suddenly brushed his sleeves and disappeared. The governor sent men to search the city. They heard flute music near the government office, but when they arrived, the sound came from the East Gate. Rushing there, they heard it at the West Gate; at the West Gate, it shifted to the South Gate; at the South Gate, to the North Gate; and at the North Gate, to the Yellow Crane Tower. The Daoist entered a stone pavilion and vanished, leaving only a poem:\n\n*\"Fluting at Yellow Crane Tower,\nWhite duckweed, red reeds mirror the river’s edge.\nDeep feelings yearn to be spoken, yet none understand—\nOnly the clear wind and bright moon know.\"*\n\nAt the end was a small character: *\"Lü.\"*\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"The game revealed victory and defeat in an instant,\nA bright moon hung over the waters’ edge.\nIn vain they chased the sound through four gates—\nThey could not grasp the move within the board.\"*\n\n**The Sixty-Seventh Transformation: The Seven Sons’ Trial**\n\nChen Qizi, a barber, and his wife ran a tea shop where they offered haircuts and shaves. One day, a Daoist arrived carrying a silver ingot and asked for a shave. No sooner was his hair cut than it regrew; as soon as it regrew, it was cut again. From dawn till dusk, the couple’s hands nearly fell from exhaustion. Realizing he was no ordinary man, they asked, *\"Will you teach us the Dao?\"* The Daoist replied, *\"I will return tomorrow.\"* Chen rose early to wait, but the Daoist never came. Months passed in silence. Chen abandoned his trade and wandered as a mendicant in search of him, yet after decades, he found no trace. His resolve wavered, and he thought of returning home. After traveling five *li*, he suddenly saw the Daoist emerge from the mountains. *\"I am Lü Dongbin,\"* the man said. *\"With such sincerity, how could you not attain the Dao?\"* He transmitted the elixir formula and gave a poem:\n\n*\"Hand in hand we ascend to the Jade Emperor’s realm,\nA bond from past lives, no common thread.\nWith you, a turn of the golden blade’s hand—\nShave away the endless frost upon your head.\"*\n\nFrom then on, Qizi cultivated diligently.

He cried out in the streets, *\"I am Lü Dongbin! Whoever bows to me shall receive this pill.\"* The crowd dismissed him as mad, gathering to mock and ridicule him, some even heaping abuse. The Daoist paid no heed, pacing the market’s lanes again and again.",

      "translated_text": "The ink was barely over an inch in size, yet priced at three thousand coins. For days, it found no buyer, and the crowd mocked and ridiculed him. A butcher named Wang remarked, *\"The ink is small, yet the price is steep—does it hold some hidden value?\"* He then spent three thousand coins to buy a bamboo shoot and invited the merchant to drink until drunk before returning home. Deep in slumber past midnight, there came a knock at the door. It was the merchant, returning the money and bidding farewell. Upon inspection, the ink had transformed into a piece of purple gold, bearing the character *\"Lü.\"* Searching for the merchant again proved futile, for he had vanished without a trace.\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"A single ink for three thousand—intent profound,\nOnly the One who knows the Dao could fathom its sound.\nThough the butcher Wang saw with keen sight,\nHe gained the gold but lost the heart’s light.\"*\n\n**The Sixty-Ninth Transformation: Selling a Filthy Comb at a High Price**\n\nThe Perfected Lord wandered to the Tianxin Bridge in Wuchang, where he sold a shabby, filthy wooden comb. He set the price at a thousand coins, yet for months, no one purchased it. Soon, an elderly beggar woman, over eighty years old, hobbled by—her back bent, her hair as white as frost. The Perfected Lord said to her, *\"People chase what lies before their eyes, yet when they see me selling this shabby, filthy item at a high price, do they grasp my true intent? Among thousands, not one possesses insight—how then can they advance upon the Way?\"* He then gave the comb to the old woman to arrange her hair. With each stroke, her hair grew longer, black as raven’s wings, cascading to the ground, and her appearance grew youthful. The onlookers, struck with awe, clamored to buy the comb. The Perfected Lord smiled and said, *\"Those who see do not recognize; those who recognize do not see.\"* With that, he cast the comb into the river below, where it transformed into a blue dragon and soared into the sky. Both the Perfected Lord and the old woman vanished from sight.\n\n*A poem in reflection:*\n*\"A filthy comb, a thousand coins—luring the crowd,\nFor months, none grasped the hidden vow.\nOnly when hair flowed did they covet its grace,\nAs the dragon vanished into the cloud’s embrace.\"*\n\n**The Seventieth Transformation: Breaking Protocol While Drunk**\n\nThe Perfected Lord wandered through the market of Baling, where Prefect Chen Fu emerged with his procession. The Perfected Lord, violating protocol, refused to yield and was seized by the guards. The prefect had him thrown into prison and ordered him to write a confession. By dusk, he had not written a single word. The jailer pressed him, but the Perfected Lord replied, *\"Wait until I sober up.\"* The jailer scoffed, *\"How can you not fear punishment and seek solace in wine?\"* Before he could finish speaking, the Perfected Lord vanished, leaving behind only a slip of paper that read:\n\n*\"A fleeting farewell to Penglai’s sea-bound shore,\nBy chance I met the prefect—what was this for?\nBeneath the Northern Dipper’s bowl I dwell,\nMy sword hangs by the Southern Winnower’s horn so well.\nWhen I am drunk, I am truly drunk,\nWhat sorrow is, I know not—what’s its brink?\nWhy meet yet fail to recognize my face?\nI ride the white clouds home, leaving no trace.\"*\n\nThe prefect exclaimed, *\"This is Lord Lü!\"* At dawn, he burned incense and begged forgiveness.

The Perfected Lord said: *\"This is the principle of nature.\"* *\"What is Heaven’s Mandate?\"* Chen bowed again, and the Perfected Lord silently imparted it to him. Thereupon, he attained the Dao.

      "translated_text": "One evening, Yang, emboldened by drink, approached the Daoist. The Daoist said: \"I have long since achieved the union of *kan* and *li* within my body, the inner harmony of husband and wife. The sacred embryo has taken form, and the infant and elder brother give rise to one another. How could I still cling to external beauty? The joy of inner union far surpasses that of the outer world.\" Yang, bewildered, found his words strange and incomprehensible.\n\nAt the time, the grand councilor Zhang Tianjue and the court guest Xiao, both long familiar with Yang, were told of this by her. Xiao relayed it to Zhang, who hastened to seek out the Daoist. The Daoist cried out loudly and fled, making straight for the Cloud Hall of Binyun Hermitage, where he vanished. After a long search, they found no trace of him—only a poem left upon the wall:\n\n*With one breath, the phoenix flute rends the Great Clarity,\nGreen-robed youths chant the steps of emptiness.\nFrom the jade tower, a call awakens a thousand-year dream,\nUpon the jade peach branch, the golden parrot sings.*\n\nZhang said: \"His courtesy name is Xu Zhong—this is Lord Lü.\" Later, the hermitage was consumed by fire, leaving no remnant, yet the poem alone remained untouched, a singular marvel.\n\nAnother poem reads:\n*Unmoved by cold or heat, his body light and pure,\nHe admonished the fair one to forsake form and sound.\nYet the inner yin and yang he could not make her grasp—\nIn vain the red-crowned crane cries in the Nine Marshes.*\n\n**The Seventy-Sixth Transformation: Releasing Life at Mount Lu**\nDuring the Chongning era, a traveler sailing the sea was blown off course by a fierce wind to an island, where he beheld a cave paradise. Above the golden gates hung a plaque of jade inscribed: *Celestial Immortals’ Abode*. An old man stood at the entrance, and the traveler bowed and asked: \"What blessed realm is this?\" The old man replied: \"This is a cave heaven, a place cut off from the mortal world. Only Lü Dongbin comes here from time to time to wander and play.\"\n\nThe traveler inquired after his name, and the old man said: \"I am Pei Xiu of the Tang.\" The traveler mentioned that he had heard of a missing text at Mount Lu. Upon investigating, the locals all spoke of a Daoist who, seeing a tavern owner slicing live fish for a stew, could not bear it. He transformed the man to release the fish, but the owner refused, saying: \"I will make this fish live again.\" The cook did not believe him, so the Daoist placed a single pill into the fish’s belly—whereupon it leapt and writhed. The onlookers were astonished, and the fish was set free into the river, where it circled joyfully before swimming away. The Daoist vanished, leaving only two characters written in the sand: *Return, traveler.*\n\nThe seafarer realized that the day he had been in the cave heaven was the same as the day of the fish’s release. Thus, he abandoned his home and entered the Dao.\n\nAnother poem:\n*A seafarer’s boat, blown to a cave heaven—\nClearly, from a past life, he had immortal ties.\nHearing of the fish’s death, he awakened at last—\nWhy not, in that cave heaven, bow and become a transcendent?*\n\n**The Seventy-Seventh Transformation: Admonishing the Judicial Commissioner**\nThe Perfected Lord wandered to Jiangxia, disguising himself as Lü Yuangui. He frequented the home of a local named Yang, foretelling fortunes with divine accuracy and urging the people to awaken to the Dao. One day, he suddenly took his leave, saying: \"An evil man is coming—I must avoid him.\"\n\nThat very day, the judicial commissioner Yu, on his circuit to inspect prisons, arrived in Ezhou and sought out Lord Lü, but he was nowhere to be found. Instead, they found his old acquaintance, Cen Wenxiu. When questioned, Cen insisted he knew nothing. Yu tempted him with sensual pleasures and threatened punishment, but Cen’s answers remained unchanged. Yu ordered a search of his home, where they found a long poem left behind by the Daoist, titled *On the Secrets of the Elixir*. Upon reading it, Yu realized: \"This is Lord Lü! ‘Yuangui’ was merely a splitting of the characters of ‘Mr. Lü.’ The ‘evil man’ he spoke of was me, pressing him so.\"\n\nAnother poem:\n*Coming and going to Yang’s home, he urged men to reform,\nSeeking especially to awaken the judicial commissioner.\nBy chance, he saw through Yu’s deceitful heart—\nSweeping his sleeves, he returned to the Jade Capital.*\n\n**The Seventy-Eighth Transformation: Delivering Yao Daozhen**\nIn Hezhou, there lived a man named Yao Daozhen, who in his youth served as a boatman on the Three Gorges. The Perfected Lord sent him to carry medicine sacks, traveling between Jing and Xiang for a full year. One day, while Dongbin was wandering Lake Dongting, he sat upon the water and beckoned to Daozhen. Trembling, Daozhen dared not approach, but the Perfected Lord prodded him with his staff and said: \"Is your allotted time not yet up for transcendence?\"\n\nThen he handed him twelve pills, each the size of a millet grain, saying: \"When Jupiter completes its cycle, take one pill. After finishing them, you will not die. From then on, whenever you pass a dragon’s lair, you will transform again—only beware of the Clear River.\" From that time, Daozhen ceased eating, sometimes sleeping for ten days before awakening. In scorching heat, he bundled himself in heavy furs; in the depths of winter, he lay naked upon the ice.",

      "translated_text": "Later, he arrived at Tongchuan and settled in a place called Longfu Town. In the fourth year of the Zhongning era, a man from the prefecture named He Shi, afflicted with madness, forcibly brought Daozhen to his home. There was a body of water named Clear River near Shi’s residence, and Daozhen, having forgotten the Perfected Lord’s warning, unwittingly crossed it three times. When Shi came to welcome him, his procession was excessively grand. The prefectural governor, Shi, saw this and took them for sorcerers. Daozhen and Shi were thrown into prison, where Daozhen said: \"I forgot the Perfected One’s words—this is my just deserts. What regret can there be?\" He then prostrated himself upon the ground and, after seven days, departed his body in liberation.\n\n*Verse:*\nServing the master, again and again completing three cycles,\nGrinding away the dust of the world—yet still not at rest.\nOne death, and in an instant, the previous step is forgotten,\nAs the immortal master beckons him to Yingzhou.\n\n**Inscription for the Seventy-Ninth Transformation**\nThe Perfected Lord traveled to Tianqing Abbey in Qinzhou. At that time, all the Daoist clergy had gone to a neighboring prefecture for a jiao offering, leaving only a young acolyte behind. The Perfected Lord asked for a brush to write, but the boy declined, saying the abbey had just been renovated and the master had forbidden defacing the walls. The Perfected Lord then said: \"Then trouble yourself to tend the incense burner in the Hall of Fire. I wish to pay homage to the Three Clarities.\" When he entered, he saw the clear, rippling water of a pond behind the hall. With a melon rind, he inscribed upon the wall:\n\n*A stone pool of limpid water—this is my heart,*\n*Steeping those peach blossoms in its inverted depths.*\n*Once within the empty precincts of Bangshan,*\n*Freed from worldly burdens, I play the seven-stringed zither.*\n\nAt the end, he wrote: *\"Huihou Yangshu.\"* The wall was exceedingly high, beyond the reach of any hand. When the others returned and marveled at it, they realized that *Hui* was Lü [Dongbin], and *Hou Yang* was the reverse of his name.\n\n*Verse:*\nSerene and luminous, the void is the heart of the Dao,\nThe primal essence rises and sets like sun and moon.\nIn this pure hall, who is the true kindred spirit?\nStrumming the zither’s empty strings in a single melody.\n\n**The Eightieth Transformation: Zhang Zhennu**\nZhang Zhennu was a courtesan from Wuxing, of a simple and unadorned nature.

During the Xuanhe era, a scholar visited her. Zhennu, seeing his refined and extraordinary bearing, treated him with particular reverence. She prepared wine, and they parted after a joyous evening. The next day, he returned, and thus they continued for over a month, yet he never once crossed the bounds of propriety.",

      "translated_text": "**The Eighty-First Transformation: Enlightening Liu Gaoshang**\n\nLiu Gaoshang was of a naturally pure and sincere disposition, his nature gentle and kind. He held no love for wealth or honor, promptly abandoning his riches and property. He severed worldly attachments and transcended the mundane, refusing to serve kings or nobles, for his aspirations soared high. Forsaking Confucian studies for the Dao, he retreated into forests and springs. Roaming beyond the world’s bounds, he first encountered an immortal who said to him: *\"A broken inner hinge mends, a shattered jar is made whole—cultivating the true is just like this.\"*\n\nLater, he met the Imperial Lord, and their words resonated deeply. Gaoshang asked: *\"The heart of the Dao is subtle—may I perceive it?\"* The Lord replied: *\"It lies beyond the reach of ear or eye, known only through silent communion of the spirit.\"*\n\nGaoshang inquired: *\"What is meant by ‘holding fast to the center’?\"* The Lord answered: *\"Where the seven emotions have yet to arise, where the six desires do not stir—what is that?\"* He further asked: *\"What is its form?\"* The Imperial Lord fell silent, gazing into the void as he traced a single character in the air.\n\nGaoshang bowed and said: *\"The myriad principles return to the origin, the one nature is the great void—I am no longer in doubt.\"* The Imperial Lord then asked: *\"Do you understand the true emptiness of the wisdom-life?\"* Gaoshang bowed again, entreating instruction. The Lord secretly transmitted an oral formula and departed.\n\nLater, in Anding Township of Bohai County, Gaoshang built a hut and dwelled in a garden for over twenty years, perfecting his cultivation and spreading the Dao’s teachings far and wide. Emperor Huizong summoned him thrice before he finally appeared at court, where he expounded only the principles of purity and naturalness as the foundation of governance. When the emperor inquired about the wonders of refining the golden elixir, Gaoshang replied: *\"Your Majesty governs myriad affairs—this matter lies beyond the world and need not trouble your sagely concern.\"* The emperor, silently pleased, bestowed upon him the title *Master of Subtle Wonder*.\n\nLater, he wandered to Mount Luofu, establishing a Daoist sanctuary, and manifested his transformations at the Hidden Truth Abbey in Suzhou, leaving behind stele inscriptions. He composed the *Returning to the Origin* for the world, often instructing his disciples: *\"When spirit congeals and qi gathers, the elixir forms in stillness. The heart harbors no delusive thoughts, the mind does not stray outward. Let the heart die utterly—there is no need for external seeking. The three realms undergo spiritual transformation.\"*\n\n**Poetic Imagery:**\n*A shattered jar’s hinge mends—leaks may be sealed through subtle cultivation.\nThe seven emotions arise from no-cause, the nature is clear, the wisdom-life incomplete.\nReceiving the master’s secret transmission, joy unbounded—\nRoaming the Central Plain, hidden in a garden.\nPlayfully wandering Luofu and Suzhou,\nWithin the hall, brush and ink stand as companions.\nA hundred thousand myriad wondrous transformations—\nThe imperial capital thrice summons the counselor.\nPure and tranquil, his virtuous plan fulfilled,\nHis journey complete, he rides his sword to Penglai.*\n\n---\n\n**The Eighty-Second Transformation: Exorcising the Palace Haunting**\n\nDuring the Zhenghe era, a malevolent spirit appeared in the imperial palace by day, stealing gold and jewels, violating the consorts and concubines—yet the emperor’s own chambers remained untouched.

      "translated_text": "One afternoon as the emperor dozed, he saw beyond the eastern gate a Daoist priest wearing a kingfisher-blue lotus coronet and a purple crane-feather cloak, holding a crystal ruyi scepter. The priest bowed and said, “Your servant has received the Supreme Emperor’s edict to suppress the haunting.” After a while, a warrior in golden armor seized the specter, split it open, and devoured it nearly whole. The emperor asked who the warrior was, and the Daoist replied, “He is Lord Guan Yu, the Perfected Lord of Sagely Tranquility whom Your Majesty has enfeoffed.” The emperor repeatedly expressed his gratitude, then asked where Zhang Fei was. Guan Yu answered, “Fei is my brother through many kalpas. Now he has been reborn to Your Majesty in the household of the Yue family in Xiangzhou. In the future, he will assist in the restoration of the dynasty, and Fei will render great service.” The emperor asked the Daoist’s name, and he replied, “My surname is Yang, and I was born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month. Your Majesty’s nature inclines toward the strange and marvelous, and your mind is not upright, which has allowed evil to invade the palace. You must rectify your mind and cultivate purity and tranquility to govern and transform the realm, thereby averting future incursions by treacherous thieves.” The emperor did not comprehend, and the Daoist vanished, leaving the emperor to believe he was Lü Dongbin.\n\nFrom that time onward, the palace hauntings ceased entirely. The emperor then decreed that all places where Lü Dongbin was venerated with incense should be officially designated as sites of the “Wondrous Daoist Transformations of the Perfected Spirit.” He also commissioned a statue of Lü to be enshrined in the Jingling Palace, where seasonal sacrifices were offered. A poetic reflection follows:\n\nThe Son of Heaven, the Celestial Origin flourishes,\nIn pure sincerity, he holds fast to the center.\nWhen sincerity and the center are not obscured,\nAbove and below, all is harmonious and free.\nTreacherous flatterers retreat into hiding,\nDark malevolence severs its shadowy threads.\nThe loyal and good uphold the true transformation,\nWhile demons and monsters lose their numinous power.\nIn purity and tranquility, yin and yang are balanced,\nPeace and harmony bring abundance to all beings.\nWeapons and warfare are stilled,\nAnd the world delights in the wind of benevolence.\n\n**The Eighty-Third Transformation: Playfully Wandering Luofu**\n\nThe Perfected Lord wandered to the Zhuming Abbey on Mount Luofu. Arriving at a small courtyard, he found the Daoist master away and only a young novice present. The novice bowed to the Perfected Lord and said, “Master, please sit here for a moment.” He then secretly took the Daoist’s wine and offered it to the Perfected Lord, who drank his fill. The Perfected Lord then instructed the novice to finish the rest, but the novice refused. The novice suffered from a cataract in his left eye, so the Perfected Lord chanted over the remaining wine and applied it to the novice’s eye. Suddenly, the eye cleared, as if it had never been afflicted. The Perfected Lord then took up a brush and painted a landscape on the wall, depicting three ponds at the foot of a mountain. He said, “If you drink my wine, you will attain immortality. If you do not, it is your fate—yet you will still enjoy long life.” With these words, he flew into the stone wall and vanished.\n\nWhen the Daoist master returned and saw the mountain painting extending through the wall inside and out, he was astonished and exclaimed, “The three ponds at the mountain’s base form the character *kun*—was this not Master Lü?” Later, the novice indeed lived to the age of one hundred and fifty before passing away. A poetic reflection follows:\n\nWith carefree steps, he wanders the seas and peaks,\nTurning, he suddenly arrives at Luofu.\nThe Daoist eye opens, dispelling darkness,\nMountains and waters conceal his name, returning to the Great Void.\n\n**The Eighty-Fourth Transformation: Admonishing the Monk of Changsha**\n\nThe Perfected Lord wandered to Changsha, disguising himself as a returning Daoist.",

One day, seated by the roadside in the market, he declared, “Whoever can fill my jar with coins shall be taught the Dao.” The crowd vied to toss coins into the jar, yet it remained unfilled. A monk, pushing a cart laden with coins, jested, “Can your jar hold this?” The Daoist replied, “Indeed.” He then bade the monk push the cart into the jar. A deep, resonant sound arose, and in an instant, the cart vanished. The monk exclaimed, “Are you a divine immortal or a master of illusion?” The Daoist extemporized a poem:\n\nNeither god nor immortal,\nNeither illusion nor trick.\nHeaven and earth have their end,\nMulberry fields shift and change.\nThis body is not your true self—\nWhy cling to it so?\nWhy not follow me,\nRiding a whale through boundless skies?\n\nThe monk grew ever more astonished and suspicious, wishing to kill him. The Daoist said, “Do you grieve for these coins? I shall repay you now.” He took a slip of paper, cast it into the jar, and intoned, “Hasten to push the cart out.” After a long while, nothing emerged. The Daoist said, “Only I can retrieve it myself.” With that, he leapt into the jar and vanished. The monk shattered the jar, finding only a slip of paper inscribed with a poem:\n\nTo seek the true, first know the true,\nYet seeing it, you fail to wake.\nWe’ll meet again with a laugh,\nDriving your cart on the eastern road.\n\nThe monk returned in dejection.

      "translated_text": "**The Eighty-Fifth Transformation: Warning Lou Daoming**\n\nLou Daoming of Zitong was wealthy and skilled in the arts of the Plain Girl. He kept young maidens, selecting only those of exceptional beauty, plumpness, and flawless complexion—never fewer than ten. Yet he was generous in aiding the poor and often performed hidden acts of kindness. His spirit was clear, his body robust, his face like a peach blossom. Sometimes he went months without eating, and at ninety-seven, he appeared no older than fifty. He was particularly fond of boasting and exaggeration. When entertaining guests, he might claim the Plain Girl had sent him fruit or that Peng Zu and Rong Cheng had bequeathed him writings, insisting he was a true immortal.\n\nOne day, the Lord Emperor disguised himself as a beggar and came to his door. Lou, failing to recognize him, shouted at him to leave. The Lord Emperor pressed his two feet upon a stone basin, instantly carving two square holes, each three inches deep. Lou, astonished, invited him to sit beside him, saying, “You are no beggar.” He summoned his maidservants to sing *The Immortal’s Journey* and offered wine. The Lord Emperor improvised a *Wang Jiangnan* lyric to intoxicate him:\n\n*Above the Jasper Pool,*\n*Auspicious mists embrace the immortals.*\n*Silken-clad golden youths strike phoenix chimes,*\n*Green-robed maidens play simurgh pipes.*\n*Here in the Great Brahma Heaven,*\n*Drunk in the ethereal Jade Capital Mountain.*\n*The steps of emptiness sung to their end,*\n*Who knows what year this night may be?*\n*Seas turn to mulberry fields once more.*\n\nThe maidservants brought Sichuan paper for him to write upon. He wrote from the bottom of the page to the top, filling every space without leaving a gap. Lou was greatly shocked and joyfully begged for the essentials of the Dao. The Lord Emperor replied, “I transmit it by word of mouth.” Lou pressed further, and again he said, “I transmit it by word of mouth.” Suddenly, he ascended to the treetop of a large parasol tree outside the door and vanished.\n\nA few days later, Lou suddenly fell ill, vomiting a silver-like viscous fluid by the bucketful before dying. The “word of mouth” transmission and the two square holes in the stone were both allusions to the character *Lü*.\n\n**Verse:**\nMaster Lou was sturdy and vigorous, his nature kind and benevolent.\nYet his heart strayed from the true path—his claims of wine, fruit, and bequeathed writings were all demonic illusions.\nStill, his many hidden virtues moved the Patriarch to warn and save him.\nAlas, Daoming failed to awaken!\nThe lofty scholar’s will, the true immortal’s essence—\nCultivating vast emptiness, he blows the jade flute,\nAbsorbing the celestial music of the jade pipes.\nPurifying the radiant heart,\nFar from the sea of desire,\nHe overturns the mountain of the self.\nExploring the mysteries of the Dark and Plain,\nLou clung to perverse defenses, mistaking them for the Dao—\nCease this harm to the cinnabar field!\n\n---\n\n**The Eighty-Sixth Transformation: The Crane Assembly at Mount Qingcheng**\n\nAt the end of the Shaoxing era, the Lord Emperor attended the Crane Assembly at Mount Qingcheng and rested at the home of a pastry vendor. The man did not recognize him and, when the Lord Emperor drunkenly vomited into a basin of rancid dough, showed no displeasure. Instead, a strange fragrance filled the room, and the people marveled. Lü Dongbin dipped his brush in thick ink and wrote a poem on the door’s great wooden panel:\n\n*Only fear the needle’s departure from the heart,*\n*True bronze transmuted into gold.*\n*The temples’ once-white hair*\n*Gallops away like a steed, hard to find.*\n\nHe signed it: *Lü Dongbin was here.* The brushwork was vigorous, its luster extraordinary, drawing a crowd. Some tried to carve it away, but the ink had already penetrated the wood’s reverse, growing even more vivid. At that time, a scholar named Guan Yunxiang saw it and recognized the figure in the poem as a gaunt Daoist.\n\nAfterward, the pastry vendor’s family held a grand feast in honor of the oil cakes.\n\n**Verse:**\nAt the Crane Assembly on Qingcheng, the golden needle was bestowed,\nSpilling forth entrails turned to gold across the earth.\nHow many blind mortals fail to awaken,\nAs clouds drift away, untraceable?\n\n---\n\n**The Eighty-Seventh Transformation: Delivering Cao Sanxiang**\n\nIn Anfeng County, the courtesan Cao Sanxiang contracted a loathsome disease. As she lodged travelers at her inn, the Lord Emperor disguised himself as a poor scholar seeking shelter. Her servant, seeing his shabby clothes, refused him, but Sanxiang said, “Since I stand at this gate, why distinguish between clean and filthy?” She welcomed him in and treated him with great courtesy.\n\nBefore long, Cao’s illness flared, and she suffered terribly. The Lord Emperor bound her thigh with a sinew and said, “Turn your heart, turn your heart.” Outside the door stood a long-dead soapberry tree. He applied medicine to it, and the next day, the tree revived, its branches and leaves lush and thriving. Only then did Cao realize he was a true immortal—and that the two “turn your heart” exhortations were an allusion to *Lü*. She immediately destroyed her cosmetics, abandoned her home, and traveled far away to serve in the shrine of the True Man Lü.\n\nAt the end of the Shaoxing era, Cao suddenly returned to her hometown, her appearance refined and radiant. No one recognized her. She recounted her story, then departed, never to be seen again.\n\n**Verse:**\nEvery person may become an immortal,\nIf only they turn their heart—then the path appears.\nMoved by Sanxiang’s hidden virtues,\nFrom the mire, she rose to the azure heavens.\n\n---\n\n**The Eighty-Eighth Transformation: The Jeweled Wheel’s Manifestation**\n\nDuring the Shaoxing era, the county magistrate Hu Zhen was fond of Daoist arts. He held a grand ritual at the Baolu Palace in the capital, where many masters of esoteric techniques gathered. The Lord Emperor, concealing his name, lodged among them and boasted of his extraordinary abilities. Taking a small amount of medicine in his palm, he blew on it several times. Suddenly, a red glow spread, forming a jeweled wheel in which the characters *Dongbin* appeared. The crowd was astonished, but when they searched for him, he had vanished.\n\n**Verse:**\nHeaven’s Dao is not mere technique—\nThose who claim it as such blind their eyes.\nWithin the jeweled wheel, the celestial true nature is revealed,\nSilently attaining perfect clarity and the supreme vehicle.\n\n---\n\n**The Eighty-Ninth Transformation: The Medicine That Saved Daoist Fu**\n\nDaoist Fu of Jiangling was pure and kind, daily revering the image of Lü Dongbin with utmost devotion. On New Year’s Day during the Qiandao era, he sat alone in his shop when a guest in a square cap and cloth robe entered. They spoke for a long time, then the guest rose and said, “I have a hundred coins—would you accompany me to a tavern for a drink?” Fu agreed. From then on, the guest visited every ten days, sometimes staying to drink, sometimes inviting Fu to join him.\n\nAt the time, Fu’s eyes were dim and often teary. The guest taught him to take raw and prepared *dihuang* (rehmannia), slice and dry them, then mix equal parts with Sichuan peppercorns (removing the stems, seeds, and closed pods) and lightly stir-fry the three ingredients.",

Fu followed the method and could see clearly at night. Later, he suddenly saw a true image resembling the guest—a stone statue of the Lü Dongbin he had revered.\n\n*Poetic Image:*\nWhen drinking together, the heart was already revealed,\nThe Dao-nature opened, and perfect clarity was attained.\nFu’s blessings were shallow, you might think,\nYet the medicine saved his dim and clouded eyes.\n\n**The Longxi Beggar’s Meal (Ninetieth Transformation)**\nIn Longxi County of Fuzhou, an old woman ran a roadside eatery and often offered meals to passing Buddhist monks and Daoist priests. During the Qiandao era, a Daoist came to beg for food. The old woman welcomed him warmly. When she asked his name, he did not answer. After eating, he used the charred end of a firewood stick to write on the wall: *\"Lü Dongbin came here\"*—the characters shone with an extraordinary radiance. From then on, her eatery thrived with customers.\n\nThe prefect heard of this and rode out to see it for himself, but the writing had already faded without a trace. The prefect sighed in awe and returned, convinced of the divine brush.\n\n*Poetic Verse:*\nIdly playing in Longxi, transforming a single meal,\nThe old woman kindly served, never asking whence he came.\nThe writing on the wall pointed directly to the enlightened Way—\nThe prefect, unaware, vainly hoped for more.\n\n**Warning to Commander Zhao (Ninety-First Transformation)**\nIn Tanzhou, Military Commander Zhao Buwen held a Crane Gathering on the fourteenth day of the fourth month in the ninth year of the Chunxi era. A Daoist, appearing from nowhere, lifted his robe and entered the feast hall without bowing to anyone, then vanished into an inner chamber. All that remained was a sheet of paper on the table, inscribed with a quatrain:\n\n*From this meeting, no lack of affinity,*\n*The courtyard’s splendor is a small grotto-heaven.*\n*A sword soars into the sky and flies away,*\n*Startling the old dragon of Dongting from its slumber.*\n\nAt the end was written: *\"Written by the Valley Guest.\"*\n\n*Poetic Verse:*\nEach post, with kindness, weaves the threads of Dao,\nThe immortals descend, moved by sincerity.\nLifting his robe without a bow—true tidings,\nAwakening to the body’s sleep while the spirit remains awake.\n\n**Demanding Wine in Shaozhou (Ninety-Second Transformation)**\nOutside Shaozhou city, an old woman ran a tavern. Every morning, she reverently offered three cups of wine to the True Man Lü. One day, a Daoist named Lü came to ask for wine, but she had none left. She gave him a *sheng* of murky lees instead. The Daoist asked the price, and she said, \"Twenty coins per *sheng*.\" He pointed at the wine, wrote twenty characters on a purple stone outside the door, and placed two copper coins beside them—then vanished. Upon closer inspection, the writing and coins had pierced through the stone, sinking several *chi* deep. From then on, crowds gathered to see it, and her tavern prospered. The old woman passed away at ninety while sitting in meditation. Later, people built the Kangxian Hall at her former home.\n\n*Poetic Image:*\nEach morning, she poured wine for the true immortal,\nThe ritual slight, but her heart was never light.\nTwenty-two coins pierced the stone in an instant—\nA transformed heart, joyful in long life.\n\n**Healing the Illness of the Liu Family (Ninety-Third Transformation)**\nIn Yuezhou, a poor man named Liu had been lame and barely able to walk for nearly twenty years. Every day, he burned incense at his stove, praying to heaven to cure his ailment with utmost sincerity. One day, a Daoist carrying an iron gourd visited Liu and said, \"Your illness is easy to cure. Follow me.\" Liu followed him for about two *li*, where the Daoist pointed to the ground and said, \"Beneath here, three *chi* deep, lies a five-colored stone. Dig it up.\" They did so and found a stone the size of a pellet, its hues unlike any ordinary stone. The Daoist said, \"Take it home, expose it to the sun for nine days, grind it into fine powder, and drink it with a decoction of quince peel. You will be cured. Then come to the third room on the left in the east corridor of Zhuyun Hermitage outside the city to meet me again.\" Liu followed his instructions, and after finishing the medicine, he felt as light and agile as if he had never been ill. He went to the hermitage and searched the left and right walls but found no one—only an image of Lü Dongbin holding an iron gourd.\n\n*Poetic Image:*\nPoor in body, suffering in illness, yet his heart stood firm,\nTwenty years of sincere prayers to the high heavens.\nA borrowed image, a compassionate lesson—\nSuddenly cured, his steps light and free.\n\n**Prefect Zhang’s Enlightenment (Ninety-Fourth Transformation)**\nEast of Chuixing Temple in Yiyang County, Tanzhou, stood the Laizhen Hall. During the Qiandao era, the Lord Emperor had once visited and inscribed a poem on its wall. A cloth robe had brushed against him in the ninth month of autumn, leaving Prefect Zhang Diao filled with admiration. During the Chunxi era, when Zhang was magistrate of Yueyang, he ordered the restoration of the Lü Dongbin statue. That night, Lü appeared in a dream to thank him and said, \"You have kept the *Threefold Method of the Five Metal Elixirs* hidden for years. You should transmit it to later generations so that all may witness the great Dao, rather than keeping it for yourself alone.\" Upon waking, Zhang had the text printed in the prefectural study to spread its teachings widely.\n\nThe preface to the *Threefold Method* reads:\n*\"From youth, I studied Confucian teachings; in adulthood, I grew fond of the mysteries of the Dao.

      "translated_text": "At Mount Lu’s Kai Xian Monastery, the monk Fazhen had sat in meditation for twenty years, his precepts and conduct exemplary. One day, as he entered samādhi, he saw a Daoist come to call and ask: “Master, do you hold that the Dao is to be realized through sitting alone?” Fazhen replied: “So I do.” The Daoist said: “The Buddha’s precepts forbid greed, anger, delusion, and killing. How is it that when you sit, you claim to have extinguished these impulses, yet when you encounter circumstances or objects, you cannot master yourself? Then these four kinds of mind scatter and surge beyond control—can the Dao reside in sitting alone?”\n\nThereupon he led Fazhen through the monks’ hall. They saw a monk fast asleep, snoring deeply. The Daoist said: “Let us sit here a while and observe this monk.” After a long time, they saw a small crimson serpent, over five inches long, emerge from the crown of the sleeping monk’s head. It slithered down the left leg of the bed to the floor, crossed over to feed on spittle and phlegm, then circled the chamber pot and drank before departing. It glided outside the veranda, crossed a small ditch, and wound around a flower terrace, pausing as if to rest. Crossing back, it encountered the Daoist, who poured a bucket of water to flood the ditch, forcing the serpent to retreat. The Daoist then planted a small blade in its path. Seeing it, the serpent shrank back, found a side route, reached the right leg of the bed, and re-entered through the crown of the monk’s head.\n\nThe monk awoke with a start and, greeting the Daoist and Fazhen, said: “I just had a dream. Let me tell you both. At first, I dreamed I exited through the left gate and encountered two fine vegetarian offerings. I ate them, then came upon fine wine and drank. Crossing a small river outside the gate, I met dozens of beautiful women and gazed at them to my heart’s content. Crossing another small river, the water suddenly rose, and I could not proceed. Turning back, I encountered a bandit who tried to kill me. I fled by a shortcut, entered through the right gate, and awoke.”\n\nThe Daoist and Fazhen laughed heartily and left, saying: “Your feet were the gates; your spittle, phlegm, and urine were the offerings and wine; the ditch was the river; the flowers and trees were the beautiful women; and the blade was the bandit. Such are the illusions of dream and delusion.”\n\nFazhen asked: “What was that serpent?” The Daoist replied: “This monk’s nature is venomous and prone to anger. His habitual tendencies have altered his form and color, and he has already taken on the appearance of a serpent. When he closes his eyes in death, he will be born among serpents. Should he not be terrified?” Then he said: “I am Lü Dongbin. Seeing your sincerity and capacity for the Dao, I have come to instruct you.”\n\nThe monk bowed in reverence and sought guidance. Later, he followed the Daoist away, and none knew his ultimate fate.\n\n*Poetic Imagery:*\nFazhen’s virtue and conduct stood apart from common men;\nOur Ancestor, in mercy, came to rescue him from dust.\nThe seed of Dao lies benighted through love and desire;\nThe Buddha-mind grows deluded over food and lust.\nThe four beginnings extinguished, the primordial lord is clear;\nOne nature, perfectly pure, reveals its original truth.\nThe sleeping monk, now awakened, at last gains insight—\nTogether they follow the Master beyond the heavens, in joy eternal.\n\n*Ninety-Sixth Transformation: Wandering Shen’s Garden*\nShen Weixin of Huzhou was kind and full of hidden virtue. His family garden was most splendid. During the Qingyuan era, a visitor in a dark blue robe and headscarf entered and wandered freely. His appearance was quite unusual. The gardener hurried to inform the master, but when they searched, the visitor had vanished. Only on the wall of the rear pavilion did they find a poem:\n\nA thousand miles I came, the road from Shu so long;\nWith staff in hand, I wander idly through a hundred-flowered estate.\nWhose home holds parrots and dogs amid a thousand households’ market?\nWithin lies a hidden isle where immortals abide.\nNestling swallows and calling turtledoves—spring at ease;\nFalling blossoms and flying catkins—water faintly gleams.\nThe master has resolved his worldly affairs;\nHere he reopens Green Wild Hall.\n\nAt the end was written: “Composed by the Daoist Xiang.” Some said *xiang* was a reversal of *hui*, meaning it must have been Lü Dongbin.\n\n*Poetic Imagery:*\nSincerity and trust—within the gourd, sun and moon stretch long;\nAmid waters and mountains, the immortal’s estate lies hidden.\nLike peril in the world revealing what is true,\nIt is best to hide deep where clouds take root.\nProfound and solid, harmonious—here the Daoist finds joy;\nVain and flashy, cunning—worldly men grow lost in mist.\nShen’s garden, lovely in every detail,\nHow could it compare to White Jade Hall on Mount Jing?\n\n*Ninety-Seventh Transformation: Deliverance of Yang Taiming*\nYang Taiming of Nankang was filial toward his parents. After their deaths, he built a hut by their graves and remained in mourning for three years before returning home. One day during his vigil, on the seventh day of the seventh month, the Pure Yang Emperor came to call and said: “You will face a calamity in the eighth month. Take my medicine, and it will pass.” He produced a small gourd, took out medicine, and gave it to Taiming, who swallowed it. Then the Emperor spread his robe over Taiming’s back and said: “Will you come with me?” Taiming assented. The Emperor placed him inside the gourd. Bewildered, Taiming was about to speak when the Emperor laughed and said: “What am I doing? I was merely testing you.” He reached into the gourd and returned Taiming to his place.\n\nPresently, the Emperor took a cup of water, dropped the medicine into it, and stirred with his hand. In an instant, the medicine gathered into a pellet the size of a bullet, its radiance dazzling. He asked Taiming: “Would you like to take it?” Taiming replied: “Perhaps later.” The Emperor then consumed it himself and said slowly: “To hesitate is already to miss the mark. You endure hardship here—do you ever think of how to provide for your daily needs? I have something to give you.” He took a clod of earth and blew on it, turning it into purple gold. Taiming, thinking the Emperor was tempting him with profit, refused to accept it. The Emperor kicked the gold, turning it back into stone.\n\nTaiming said: “All the immortals have left me poems. Can you do the same?” The Emperor immediately took up a worn brush, dipped it in a cup of water, and with three or four strokes on the ground, wrote boldly on the wall:\n\nYang is a man of true integrity,\nHis filial piety resounding through heaven and earth.\nHeaven, pitying his hardship,\nSent me on the seventh night to visit him.\nI offered medicine to transform stubborn stone,\nAnd left you wealth for generations to come.\nSince you would not accept it from me,\nI would not force it upon you.\nThe winds and dust make brief my stay—\nI hope your resolve remains unswerving.\nWhen the time comes for the Rat’s year,\nYou will see the clouds turn as easily as a palm.\n\nAt the end, he signed: “Presented by the Returning Guest,” then departed. At first, the characters seemed faint and hard to discern, but soon their color deepened to a rich red, sinking several *fen* into the wall.\n\nIn the first month of the Year of the Rat, a perfected one came and took Taiming away with him.\n\n*Poetic Imagery:*\nThe Dao’s source is one—bright or dim, heaven and earth diverge.\nHeaven and earth rise and fall;\nSun and moon come and go.\nThe world rarely sees clarity and emptiness;\nWealth and honor—men vie to enjoy them.",

Can anyone transmute mercury into silver?” None answered, until the lowest-ranking Daoist stepped forward out of turn: “Transmuting mercury into silver relies on some cause and is not worth discussing. This poor Daoist specializes in using earth for the task.” The emperor was astonished and immediately commanded him to proceed. The Daoist then mixed clay, shaped it into silver ingots, and placed them in the furnace. After firing, radiant light burst forth in all directions, and true silver was formed.

      "translated_text": "His aspirations and conduct were lofty, unbound by trivial conventions, and he excelled in both literary and martial arts. In the early years of the Tianchun era, he tested in military strategy, passed the imperial examination, and was renamed Shixiong, styled Dewei. He delighted in almsgiving, aiding others, and accumulated much hidden virtue. Once he sighed, saying: \"Confucius was free from doubt at forty, Mencius unmoved in heart at forty—yet I, past that age, still toil in worldly affairs. Am I not foolish?\"\n\nOne day, the Master drank at a tavern in Ganhe Town when suddenly two men of identical form and visage appeared, each draped in felt robes, sitting and smiling at him. Startled, the Master followed them as they left. Upon reaching their dwelling, he bowed and earnestly sought their instruction. The two immortals slowly replied: \"This one may be taught.\" They then awakened his nature, and the Master suddenly attained enlightenment. The immortals further instructed: \"The wondrous subtlety lies in the clarity of the heart and the illumination of the nature. When your worldly burdens melt like ice and your karmic entanglements dissolve, we shall entrust you to your destined teacher.\" The Master was then named Haichan, renamed Jia, and styled Zhiming. Thereafter, he feigned madness, and people took him for a lunatic—though he accepted the reputation as his own.\n\nUpon closer examination, the two immortals were revealed to be the twin Lüs, the Immortals. Secretly transmitted as the *One Hundred and Second Transformation of Master Chongyang*.\n\nAfter his enlightenment at Ganhe Town, Master Chongyang feigned madness and rejoiced in freedom, untroubled by worldly affairs. Thus, he severed karmic ties and shed worldly burdens, leaving the dust of the mundane behind for over a year. Suddenly, two immortals appeared—clad in blue headscarves and hempen robes, each bearing two sacks and an inverted fan. The Master glimpsed them and recognized the same felt-robed masters from before. He bowed, calling them \"Teacher,\" and invited them into a tavern. As the wine drew to a close, he inquired after their names, but they did not answer. As they departed, they pointed to Liu Haichan’s boat, saying: \"This is your teacher.\" Chongyang paid his respects, and Liu transmitted the secret seal of the true, empty wisdom-life, along with five esoteric verses, instructing: \"Master these thoroughly, then burn them. I am Pure Yang, disciple of the True Yang Master.\" With that, he leaned on his staff alongside Haichan, riding the wind into the clouds.\n\n**The One Hundred and Third Transformation: Jing Zhongshan**\nJing Zhongshan of Changsha resigned from office in Jining during the Jisi year of Jiading and returned home. As his boat docked at the southern ferry of Baling during the evening watch, he suddenly saw another vessel pass by. Aboard it stood a man in a yellow robe, his bearing extraordinary, gazing fixedly at Zhongshan for a long while. Zhongshan peered into the cabin and saw no other belongings—only ten black jars on the bow and two blue-clad youths standing unevenly before the awning. Assuming the man would cross directly, he watched as the boat advanced only two *zhang* before turning back, the yellow-robed figure once more seated solemnly in the stern.\n\nThe two boats sailed side by side for one or two *li*, the man gazing intently at Zhongshan again before the vessel vanished. Zhongshan, who had taken him for a wealthy merchant and not spoken to him, was now struck with astonishment, realizing he had encountered an immortal. The next day, he visited the Lü Immortal Pavilion to pay homage to the true image—there stood the figure in a yellow robe, flanked by two youths in blue, their appearances identical to those he had seen the day before. Zhongshan lamented his mortal eyes’ failure to recognize a divine being and sighed deeply. Later, he composed a *Shuidiao Getou* lyric, including the line: *\"At the southern ferry port, I meet again the boat of Lord Lü.\"*\n\nThe following year, Zhongshan passed away. His grandson Jingjian would later show others a portrait of his grandfather’s encounter with the yellow-robed immortal, depicting one of transcendent purity and aloofness from the world.\n\n**The One Hundred and Fourth Transformation: Visiting Hanshan Temple**\nThe Emperor Lord traveled to Hanshan Temple, resting five *li* outside the Changmen Gate of Suzhou.",

      "translated_text": "One night, a fierce wind arose, and the temple’s pagoda bells clanged incessantly, their din unceasing even by dawn. That morning, the abbot of the temple served tea. When asked his surname, he replied, “Lü.” As they sat in conversation, the Emperor Lord remarked on the night’s wind that had set the bell chimes clattering so vexatiously. The abbot jested, “You are Master Lü—why not bid the bells fall silent?” The Emperor Lord smiled, then blew a breath to still them, and at once, the clamor ceased. The monks, astonished, looked up—only to find him vanished. Then the abbot realized he had been in the presence of the true Master Lü. Later, the monks removed the old bells and replaced them with new ones, yet to this day, they make no sound.\n\n**The One Hundred and Fifth Transformation: The Portrait at Yizhen**\nAt the Tianqing Abbey in Zhenzhou, the prior had long venerated the Perfected Lord of Pure Yang. One day, he resolved to commission a clay statue for worship. The wooden armature was prepared, and the clay applied—yet the artisan failed to arrive as promised. Suddenly, a scholar seeking lodging appeared. Learning of the prior’s frustration, the scholar inquired and offered, “This humble one is skilled in sculpture. Do not fret; by tomorrow, I shall complete the statue.” The prior, overjoyed, hosted him warmly. That night, the scholar drank deeply and retired. The next morning, the prior invited him to an early meal, but he had already departed. Just then, two or three monks arrived, exclaiming that someone had sculpted a statue of the Perfected Lord Lü in the corridor’s shrine the night before. The prior rushed to see—indeed, the statue stood there, its features refined and spirit luminous, one foot drawn up in serene repose. All rejoiced, offering thanks and alms. From then on, prayers were never unanswered. Later, when fire ravaged the abbey three times, the statue alone remained unscathed. The events are recorded on a stele at the abbey.\n\n**The One Hundred and Sixth Transformation: The Perfected One of Guan Pass**\nThe Perfected One of Guan Pass was born a poor girl with a lofty aspiration to transcend the world. At sixteen, her parents arranged a marriage, but she fled into the mountains and never returned. When hunger gnawed at her, she gathered acorns to eat. Suddenly, an old man appeared—his beard and brows trailing to the ground, his eyes gleaming with a jade-like light. He traced a line across her abdomen and declared, “I have severed your red dragon. From now on, you may enter the Dao.” Guan bowed and sought instruction. The elder imparted esoteric teachings in secret. She thanked him but said, “Yet the burden of sustenance remains—how can I pursue the Dao?” The old man replied, “That is easily solved.” From his sleeve, he produced an acorn, radiant as a pellet of light, and said, “Eat this, and you shall never hunger.” She consumed it, and after some time, it was gone—along with the old man. Upon returning home, she lost all taste for cooked food, eating only fruits and drinking water. Her menses ceased, and her movements became as effortless as a spirit’s. Her parents no longer pressed her to marry. During the Chunyou era, she was summoned to court. The Empress Dowager favored her and ordained her as a Daoist, bestowing the title *Perfected One*. Once, when dispatched by imperial decree to offer incense at the Heavenly Master’s altar on Dragon-Tiger Mountain, a Daoist priest saw her and remarked to others, “Her skin is delicate as jade, her brows and eyes finely wrought—truly a heavenly maiden. Her spirit is serene, her bearing refined beyond the ordinary.” Guan later composed *The Biographies of Female Immortals* in seven fascicles, stating that the old man she met was none other than the Perfected Immortal Dongbin.\n\n**The One Hundred and Seventh Transformation: The Elixir of Mo Di**\nMo Di, an elderly military officer in Yangzhou, had long since resigned his commission. At home, he devoted himself to the Dao, converting many to its Way, accumulating merit to atone for past transgressions, and often fasting with fellow Daoists to aid the poor. One day, a Daoist encountered him and asked, “What Dao have you studied?” Mo replied, “My life has been one of repentance—for the sin of killing. How dare I aspire to the Dao? Since my youth, I have fought in a hundred battles, taking countless lives. Now, at seventy-three, I deeply regret it, for I often see the vengeful spirits of the slain.” The Daoist said, “Life and death follow the same principle; sin and blessing are fundamentally empty. If you deem yourself guilty, guilt manifests. If you see no sin, evil vanishes. The forms and shadows of your foes arise from your own mind—they are not real. The ancients, whether committing great good or great evil, found that at the extreme, a single thought could reverse fate—its power is immense.” He then led Mo to the water’s edge, where Mo indeed saw over a hundred blood-drenched figures gathering around him. Terrified, he wept and begged for mercy. The Daoist shouted, and the vengeful spirits scattered. He then gave Mo three elixir pellets, saying, “Take three, and you shall become a celestial immortal; two, an earthly immortal; one, a lord of the underworld.” Mo placed the pellets on his palm—one ascended into the sky, one fell to the earth, and he swallowed the last. The Daoist said, “Your fate is thus determined.” Mo bowed and asked his name. The Daoist traced the character *Lü* in the air before vanishing. From then on, Mo abstained from cooked food, and his insight into others’ fortunes grew keen. At the age of one hundred and three, he sat upright and passed away.\n\n**The One Hundred and Eighth Transformation: The Crossing of Monk Zhang**\nThe monk Zhixuan of Mount Heng, surnamed Zhang, once visited the Xiugai Peak’s Monastery of Cultivating the Real. There, he encountered the Emperor Lord, and their exchange of Chan wit was so swift and harmonious that it seemed fated. The Emperor Lord asked, “In the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, when Śākyamuni Buddha and Prabhūtaratna Buddha enter the stupa and merge, sitting side by side on the golden couch without distinction of left or right—what do they speak of?” The monk was at a loss. He bowed and asked for an answer. The Emperor Lord replied, “This is the true Dharma of the Buddha and patriarchs—the eye that conceals the true form, the marvel of mind-to-mind transmission beyond the teachings of emptiness and reality. The merging of the two Buddhas is the fusion of nature and life. Their lack of distinction between left and right is the unity of the Great Void. You cling to one side, believing that seeing nature is sufficient for enlightenment—how partial is your view!” The monk bowed again and begged for further instruction. The Emperor Lord imparted a secret teaching. The monk exclaimed, “Without meeting a true master, I would have nearly wasted this life!” The Emperor Lord then inscribed a poem to mark the occasion:\n\n*For a hundred autumns, Pure Yang’s Dao has faded,*\n*Yet the five lakes and four seas remain his to roam.*\n*This body has already transcended the three thousand realms,*\n*Each day, I traverse scores of states.*\n*Drunk beneath the clear wind and bright moon,*\n*I trample the red smartweed and white duckweed isles.*",
