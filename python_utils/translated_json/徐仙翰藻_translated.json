Continuation of the Daoist Canon*\n\n**Scroll One of Xu Xian’s Elegant Compositions**\n\n**Record of the Lingji Ancestral Temple**\nThe term \"ancestor\" speaks of origins. My surname is Xu, descendant of King Yan of Xu, a lineage that served the Tang dynasty. When the Five Dynasties fell into chaos, I received the Son of Heaven’s command to guard Jinling. In the second year of Kaiyun of the Jin (945 CE), the Min king Wang’s internal strife erupted into war. I then led cavalry commanders Zha, Bian, and ten thousand riders to defect to Jianzhou. The following year, I seized Fuzhou, took the western path through the Xi gorge, scaled the Deer Ridge, and advanced from Nantai County to capture Zhang and Quan. A villager surnamed Hu knelt before my horse and said: \"Just now, routed soldiers wrought havoc, becoming the people’s unforeseen enemy. Today, we behold the royal army once more. If Your Lordship pities their innocence and revives them with a breath, sparing them from calamity, no virtue could be greater.\"\n\nThe troops halted and formed ranks. I instructed my sons Shang and Bo to join forces and, by military discipline, blunt the enemy’s assault. The rebels perished in battle, and the people found respite. When the army withdrew, the elders still harbored the lingering affection of *tiepao*. I pondered Li Yushi’s counsel on leniency and, from horseback, devised a plan, knowing the time had come to act with them. The following year, I indeed escaped transformation amid the snares of the ranks. My spirit, undiminished, descended to become a deity upon the southern slope of Biefeng. Initially, there was no temple—only a thatched hut and a wooden incense burner. Yet during the seasonal sacrifices of *Fu* and *La*, the rites were never neglected.\n\nIn the spring of the eighth year of Taiping Xingguo in the Song Dynasty (the year *guiwei*), no rain fell, and seeds remained unplanted in the earth, causing the stewards deep concern. In the second month, on the auspicious day *wuz*i, divination was performed before me. Before the old auspicious shrine lay a deep pool, its circumference spanning four or five *zhang*, its depths unfathomable. Suddenly, clouds and *qi* surged upward, lingering without dispersal the entire day. At dawn the following day, fierce winds, thunder, lightning, and hail arrived in unison, and the people rejoiced greatly.\n\nThree days later, at first light, Zai Shengming came to the shrine to seek an answer. He beheld the shrine swept away, reduced to a ruin by floodwaters. Filled with astonishment and doubt, he prepared incense and submerged it in the pool, offering prayers. Suddenly, a wooden incense burner emerged from the water’s center, its ash unsullied by moisture—sure proof of a divine presence. In an instant, twin dragons coiled in the distance, bearing the shrine westward upon their wings, until they reached the islet where the mountains barred the stream’s flow. This islet was formerly called Incense Burner Peak. Crows and magpies took flight, calling as if to welcome something. Paper money marked the boundary, and a rare fragrance suffused the air. By night, the auspicious glow of heavenly lamps appeared; by day, the sound of metal and stone resounded. The villagers marveled and, seizing the opportunity, built a temple upon the site. Later, the temple produced the auspicious sign of *lingzhi*, and so it was named the Ancestral Temple of Zhi Islet.\n\nIn the first month of the first year of Yongxi, on the day *dingmao*, the construction was completed and the matter reported. The benefactor was a man of Henan surnamed Fang, named Jue, who oversaw the work.\n\nIn the second year of Qiandao, *bingxu* (1166), Fang Jue’s grandsons—Xun, Gan, and Zhong—presented the matter to Prefect Feng Li of the prefecture, who inscribed the plaque with the four characters *Hujing Ganying* (\"Protecting the Realm, Responding to Devotion\"). In the third year of Xining, *gengxu* (1070), Zhang Guan of Hejian, Chen Pengchu of Yingchuan, Lin Huaixian of Jinan, and Huang Ban of Jiangxia reported the affair to Cheng Shimeng, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, who memorialized the throne. At the time, the Wang clan of Banshan held power in the court, and the people were burdened by the *Green Sprouts* corvée, so the matter was not addressed.\n\nIn the eighth year, *yimao* (1075), when Liu Yi, a native of the prefecture, governed Guizhou, Jiaozhi raiders invaded the border and seized Qin and Lian prefectures. Liu Shu, then serving alongside Zhou Ruli in the autumn bureau, prayed to me, and I manifested the numinous power of Mount Gong. The raiders indeed retreated. Liu Shu then submitted a full report. During the Yanshao era, my hidden merits became most conspicuous: the victory of Han Zhongwu at Dayi Garrison and the achievements of Monk Yuan of Wu’an. Xue Bi, the Pacification Commissioner of the circuit, memorialized the throne during the Duanping era.\n\nIn the first year of Duanping, *jiawu* (1234), Zhou Shuo, Supervisor of the Left Treasury, and Zhou Sui, Prefect of Chaozhou, detailed the matter and submitted it to the chief minister Li Zongmian. In the third year, *bingshen* (1236), in the tenth month, He Cong, the military commissioner of the circuit, was appointed Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, and the imperial decree was finally obtained. In the second year of Jiaxi, *wuxu* (1238), the edict was issued, bestowing the title *Lingji* (\"Numinous Aid\") and adding honorifics. The gods rejoiced, the people celebrated, and their virtue was thus made manifest.\n\nSince the dynasty began selecting officials through the examination system, I have been enrolled in the register of successful candidates. Those from my hometown who passed the examinations soared like meteors, surpassing all other counties south of the river. Thereafter, the literary flourishing grew ever greater: those listed on the *Huangjia* (imperial examination roster) were numerous, as were those selected in the highest ranks of the Southern Palace. Their reputations resounded, their ranks were lofty—some held office in the autumn court, some oversaw the imperial treasury, some governed flowery domains, some instructed the floating lords. Even those with minor ranks could be counted by the cartload or measured by the bushel.\n\nLater, Fang Ce of the Henan Fang clan, styled Zhu, and Wang Jie, styled Lang, each passed the imperial examinations through their literary talents. Both had divined their success through dreams at my shrine and received their reward. Such is the breadth of my merit among the people—far beyond the hearsay of idle gossip, achieved not in a single morning or evening.\n\nSince the temple’s founding in the Kaiyun era of the Later Jin, counting the *jiazi* cycles, over two thousand four hundred years have passed. Initially dismantled to become a village altar, its foundation lay by the banks of Qingbu Stream. It was later relocated to the east of the lane, where the present Lingji Palace now stands. The entire household, encircled by devotion, received celestial favor and titles:\n\nI, *Zhizheng*, was canonized as *Jiutian Jinque Mingdao Dade Dashian Xianling Puji Zhenren* (\"Perceiver of Truth, Great Immortal of the Ninefold Golden Towers, Illuminating the Dao and Manifesting Virtue, Numinously Efficacious and Universally Beneficent Perfected One\"), and enfeoffed as Jiang Wang.\n\nZhong, *Zhie*, was canonized as *Jiutian Yuque Xuanhua Fujiao Shangxian Zhaoling Bojie Zhenren* (\"Perceiver of Righteousness, Supreme Immortal of the Ninefold Jade Towers, Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Teaching, Illustriously Numinous and Vastly Beneficent Perfected One\"), and enfeoffed as Rao Wang.\n\nOur father, named Wen, was enfeoffed as Qi Wang and canonized as *Zhongwu Zhenren* (\"Loyal and Martial Perfected One\").\n\nOur mother, née Tian, was canonized as *Renshou Xianfei* (\"Benevolent and Longevous Immortal Consort\").\n\nMy wife, née Tao, was enfeoffed as *Jingguo Furen* (\"Lady of Jing State\") and canonized as *Shunzhu Renhui Xianfei* (\"Compliant and Assisting, Benevolent and Kind Immortal Consort\").\n\nZhong’s wife, née Xu, was enfeoffed as *Weiguo Furen* (\"Lady of Wei State\") and canonized as *Shanzhu Ciyi Xianfei* (\"Kindly Assisting, Compassionate and Virtuous Immortal Consort\").\n\nOur five sons:\n- **Chawen Hui**, *Yong’an Marshal and Guardian*, canonized as *Yuanshuai*.\n- **Bian Hao**, *Wu’an Marshal and Guardian*, canonized as *Yuanshuai*.\n- **Wei Cen**, *Military Commissioner and Left Gate Marshal*.\n- **Zhao Zhong**, *Commander-in-Chief and Right Gate Marshal*.\n- **Diao Yanneng**, *Commander of the Vanguard and Marshal of the Army*.\n\nOur four elder brothers—*Zhigao*, *Zhixun*, *Zhijian*, and *Zhixun*—were all enfeoffed as kings and received sacrifices in the temples of Jinling. Their origins and generations are fully recorded in the *History of the Five Dynasties*. This temple is the progenitor of all such shrines. *Zu* (\"ancestor\") signifies a beginning—how could one forget the origin and obscure its source?\n\nThe founding and history of the Ancestral Temple have been recounted above. All things decay with time, and without repair, they decay further. Thus, we built halls of wood and chambers of stone, planning for a hundred thousand years. The merits were vast, the expenses great, and the names and contributions of the benefactors remain on record. This occurred in the year *dinghai* (1287), the twenty-fourth year of the Zhiyuan era, on the day *dingwei* of the eleventh month.\n\nTwelve years later, the grand gate was restored, and the plaque was inscribed with the name *Zhiyu Zumiao* (\"Ancestral Temple of Zhi Islet\"). As the old stele had eroded, I descended this stele and inscribed it at the request of the gentlemen of the Henan Fang clan—Zhuangyou, Fengwu, and Sixi.\n\n**Inscription:**\nThe waters flow—trace their source.\nThe leaves of trees—seek their root.\nWhen the source runs deep, the streams diverge.\nWhen the root stands firm, the leaves flourish.\nThis is the Ancestral Temple, revered shrine of this land.\nHere it has stood for a hundred thousand years.\nIts merit rivals the sun and moon, its virtue the heavens and earth.\nIts names and titles are preserved in history.\nOf old, its temple was called *Ming* (\"Illustrious\"), and the gods were divine.\nNow, its celestial rank is that of immortal and transcendent.\nIts blessings have been bestowed upon the people—\nHow shall we repay them? With offerings of orchids and ferns.\nIn the year *dinghai*, the temple was renewed.\nTwelve years later, our gates were grandly restored.\nInscribed upon this stele, carved into stone,\nIts origins recounted, its sacrifices transmitted.\nLike the sacred peaks, its fame resounds thrice.\nFor ten thousand myriad years, we pray for the sagely lord.\n\n**Record of Lingji Palace**\nMy surname is Xu, descended from the Ying clan. The physician Boyi of the Xia dynasty was enfeoffed in Xu, in the land of Xiapei Tong County. The state flourished through the Xia, Yin, and Zhou dynasties, each era marked by great merit. King Yan of Xu governed with such renown for benevolence and righteousness that he received the auspicious omen of a crimson bow and vermilion arrows. When King Mu of Zhou heard of this, he attacked Xu. Unwilling to let his people suffer, King Yan retreated to the foot of Wuyuan Mountain in Pengcheng, naming the mountain after himself. There he dwelled. For over three thousand years, generations of descendants—eminent figures and towering scholars whose deeds are recorded in history—all trace their lineage to King Yan, my ancestor.\n\nMy family served the Tang dynasty for generations, all holding high office. During the chaos of the Five Dynasties, heroes and warlords arose in swarms, carving up the land and plundering one another. By the Son of Heaven’s decree, I was left to guard Jinling. Overseeing more than twenty prefectures south of the Yangtze, I eased taxes and relaxed levies, ensuring the army was well-provisioned. The tribes of the forests and caves adhered to the laws, holding fast to their oaths even unto death. The elderly and children played and wandered, joining hands to sing in celebration. Above, none bore grievance; below, none harbored enmity. The people of the Jiangnan region owed their lives to me. My merit and virtue shone as brightly as the sun and moon—though ages may pass, they cannot be erased.\n\nIn the second year of the *Kaiyun* era of the Jin, the King of Min, surnamed Wang, lost his state and sought my aid. I led an army of ten thousand, advancing by both ship and foot. The prefectures of Min each surrendered their cities. The following year, I took Fuzhou and captured it. As the army reached the southern bank of the Xiajiang, we passed through Qingbu. The elders of the village came forth with jars of wine to welcome my troops, yet they lamented: \"Just now, several hundred routed soldiers hid atop Biefeng Peak. Arrogant and violent, they were on the verge of rebellion. Had your royal army not arrived today, they would have overthrown our neighbors—how many of us would have remained?\" I then turned my forces southward, scaling the peak, blunting their vanguard, breaking their strength, and annihilating their ringleaders. All their followers were captured. In the end, the rebels cast aside their armor and cheered in surrender, yielding without battle. The villagers bore no grudge; markets carried on as usual. Not a single trace of disturbance marred the fields or their harvests.\n\nThus, to this day, the mountainside is called \"Battle Gate,\" marking the beginning of this event. When my army returned, the elders clung to me in admiration and reluctance, unwilling to let me depart. They cut thatch to build a hut north of Biefeng’s Dragon Gorge, where they painted my likeness and enshrined me in a temple. Morning incense and evening lamps were offered to pray for my longevity. My heart stirred with sorrow, and I swore to the people: \"Next year, I shall depart this world and dwell here, bound in friendship with you all.\" When the time came, I manifested in dreams to reveal my spirit. No year brought famine, no people suffered premature death or plague. Divinations for rain and harvests were answered as swiftly as echo follows sound. In life, I could not fully bless my people; in death, to be venerated in their land and sustained by their offerings—this is no deceit against them.\n\nAs years passed and months turned, the temple fell into disrepair, its roof leaking and walls battered by wind, leaving no shelter. Yet suddenly, a towering cloud of qi arose, and a divine dragon coiled in protection. The wooden censer remained unbroken, my likeness stood firm and unyielding—all who witnessed it marveled. A villager named Fang Jue first established a temple in the wilds of Chuanyan, honoring me with the title \"Guardian of the Realm, Moved by Devotion.\" This is the ancestral temple of Zhiyu.\n\nIn the early years of Xiangfu, customs shifted and the population flourished. The village elders consulted one another and unanimously agreed to rebuild the temple by the banks of Qingbu’s Yansi Stream. Once, the stream’s torrents surged violently, drowning fields and crops. With divine soldiers, I dredged its source and diverted its flow, ensuring it no longer harmed the people. Thus, the place is still called \"Altar of the Community,\" where traces of the past remain.\n\nAs mulberry fields turn to seas and things transform with time, there were always villagers who gladly offered their land.\n\nTo the east of Dragon’s Head Peak, the land lay broad and level, its mountains and waters both exquisite. I divined an auspicious site and made my dwelling there. Magpies and crows lent their numinous presence; bees and serpents gathered in throngs. Paper money marked the sacred bounds, and wondrous fragrance assailed the senses. By night, heavenly lamps appeared as omens; by day, the sounds of metal and stone rang forth. The villagers, moved by these signs, built a temple there. They summoned carpenters, stonemasons, and laborers, who gathered with tools in hand beneath the shrine. They hewed planks, shaped deafening columns, and laid foundations; they fired tiles, molded bricks, and raised walls. In the ding-you year of the Zhenghe era, the work was completed with ease. My likeness was rendered with solemn majesty, its presence awe-inspiring. To this day, the elders still recall and recount these events.\n\nAs the temple was expanded and opened, its halls grew deep and vast—this was during the Longxing era. In the autumn of the gui-wei year, when the reign title was changed, the kitchens and storehouses were enlarged. By the spring of the bing-yin year of the second Kaixi reign, the main halls and courtyards were erected, their steps and ranks in perfect order. Lofty was its height, resplendent its newness. Its scale and design surpassed all former efforts. This was in the eighth year of the Xianchun era, the ren-shen year. Even now, the names of the benefactors inscribed upon the beams have not faded. I reflect upon the ancients, and their hearts truly align with mine. Thus, I dare not rest idle in my abode, for I must safeguard their descendants and the common folk—such is my bounden duty, and therein lies its merit.\n\nAs for the temples and images in the west, south, and north, all trace their origins to this place. Though they were later divided and dispersed, the passage of time has been long. If one were to question the white-haired elders, they would attest to how deeply my numinous virtue has taken root in the people.\n\nDuring the calamity of the Jingkang era’s yang-nine misfortune, I protected the realm with divine soldiers, manifesting the spirit of the mountains and grasses, displaying the fluttering banners and swaying standards. The treacherous rebels were executed, and the Central Plains restored to peace. My deeds were reported to the imperial court. Though I was graciously honored by the sagely emperor, I did not cross southward in the end.\n\nDuring the Jiaxi era, the local prefect of Chaozhou, Zhou Sui, along with village elders Zhang Shaobai and others, submitted a petition to the court. A rescript in gold ink bestowed praise, conferring the honorific title *Lingji* upon me, and the temple’s sacrificial register was splendidly renewed, its rites further augmented. Both gods and men rejoiced—how grand and glorious!\n\nYet of late, times have changed and affairs diverged; the swans of the central marsh have but newly alighted. As for the temple’s upkeep, who has leisure for such matters? The roof’s crown is askew, the foundation’s sandals unaligned—who will set them right? The walls crumble in shadow, the murals dim and obscure—who will restore them? If I do not exalt my illustrious deeds, widely manifesting them to the four quarters and proclaiming them to all of you, it would be remiss indeed. Should even a single meal be neglected, how could this remain a place of reverence and divine tranquility?\n\nThe villagers each consulted me on their affairs, seeking my brush to validate their fortunes. I revealed to them the oracle, saying: *The sixty-four slips correspond to the sixty-four hexagrams of the* Yijing. *Nothing in heaven or earth lies beyond the* Yijing. *As a book of divination, it determines fortune and misfortune—thus it decides all.* Having shown them the slips’ use, how could I dare take up my brush to compose a text, entrusting and charging you all? Let this be my proclamation: from this day forward, each of you must attend to your duties, setting the mean within your hearts. Plan and labor to establish your merits, that the ruined may be revived, the old made new.\n\nI dare not claim sole credit for this glory; in initiating such affairs, the people’s livelihoods must be ordered. May they prosper in longevity and wealth, flourish and thrive—my blessings upon them are not slight. On an auspicious day in the eighth month, the autumn of the gengxu year, the work was completed, and I was asked to inscribe this record.\n\nMy royal grandfather ruled Wu and was enfeoffed as Prince of Qi, posthumously honored as *Zhongwu*. He had four elder brothers: the eldest, named Zhigao, inherited his father’s title and was later re-enfeoffed in Tang. The next, Zhixun, Zhijian, and Zhixun, all held power in Wu, were enfeoffed as princes, and each received temple sacrifices in Jinling. I am Zhizheng, enfeoffed as Prince of Jiang. My second brother, Zhikua, was enfeoffed as Prince of Rao. These events are recorded in history, and my hidden merits are detailed in the *Book of [Missing Character]*, under the *Bureau of Sacrifices*. I have partaken of this land’s offerings for over four hundred years, and shall continue for a thousand thousand more—beyond reckoning.\n\nIn this sagely dynasty’s era of unity, all within the realm offer allegiance. Heaven and earth, ghosts and spirits, all partake of its virtue. Humbly awaiting the imperial grace, I look up to the throne’s decree. May this honor and favor meet expectations, and may the people never forget. Thrice I cry: *Long live the emperor! Long live the emperor! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years!*\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*Gentle and yielding, the Prince of Yan,*\n*His filial descendants are blessed.*\n*Unfailing in virtue,*\n*He dwells in this land.*\n*By winding Biefeng, east of Dragon’s Head,*\n*The Lingji title bestowed—his merit to the people.*\n*The new temple stands resplendent,*\n*Its renown mighty and bright.*\n*Shoulder to shoulder, the people gather,*\n*Coming to offer and partake.*\n*You, the people, do not doubt—*\n*Abundant blessings descend.*\n*I pledge this ode,*\n*Carved in stone, unyielding.*\n\n**On the Stele’s Reverse:**\nSome say stele inscriptions must have a reverse side, while records need not. I know not what defines a *record* or a *stele*. Those called *records* without a reverse—such as the *Record of Music*, *Record of Learning*, *Records of History*, *Mourning Records*, *Biographies*—are not steles. Once engraved on stone, it is called a *stele*. Steles employ *ci* and *ming*, both mournful texts, while records do not. Long ago, Liu Zongyuan composed a stone inscription for his father, yet still inscribed the names of his disciples and followers on the reverse. The reverse of a *biao* began with Liu; the reverse of a *record* began with Xu, Prince of Jiang—who would dare question it?\n\n**Stele’s Reverse:**\nHeaven has not yet forsaken this culture, thus it lends me its hand to glorify virtue and illuminate goodness. It is your duty to assist me in this endeavor.\n\nRecently, Lin Dongcun’s public assembly presented the words of Zhou Junxi: *\"Shall we give birth to a Shen, or to a Yin?\"* How profound! These words speak for me. Let them be carved at your side. When scholars ascend this hall and read this record, may they know what to strive for, and never bring shame upon the gods.\n\n**Further:**\nIn life, one is a man; in death, a spirit. Those who serve the state and benefit the people deserve temple sacrifices. Temples with imperial decrees must have steles to record their deeds. Long ago, Liu Hou was demoted to the god of Luo Pool, and Han Wengong composed a record for him. Though I have emulated but a fraction of Liu Hou’s deeds, I lack his talent and cannot secure a Han Wengong to inscribe my story. How then shall I instruct posterity? I dare recount my own history; let those who come after Han Wengong record it.\n\n**Record of Upholding Sincerity:**\nThe hall of Lingji bears the inscription *Cuncheng* (\"Upholding Sincerity\")—this is the god’s own brush. One day, a guest from afar arrived, seeking to borrow my numen. Clad in ceremonial robes, he entered the hall and found the god’s compositions—steles, inscriptions, records, and eulogies. Reading them carefully, he pondered deeply before withdrawing and asking: *\"Why are only the two characters* Cuncheng *left uninscribed? Is it that they exist but remain uncarved?\"* He sought my answer.\n\nI, a spirit, cannot speak with my mouth, so I borrow brush and tongue to reply: *Sincerity is truth without falsehood. Human nature is inherently sincere; without sincerity, one cannot establish oneself. Between ruler and minister—this is sincerity. Between father and son—this is sincerity. Among brothers, husband and wife, friends—this is sincerity. Sincerity is one and the same; seek it within yourself, and it will endure. This is not the so-called* Way of Sincerity. *If one strives in this, though thunder roars above, one will not fear; though abysses yawn below, one will not tremble. There is no other reason—sincerity abides.*\n\nIf but a single word is untrue, a single phrase insincere, it is called delusion—it is not sincerity. How grave it is! In the darkest chamber, though one sees no one, every gesture, every glance, lays bare the heart’s depths. Those in whom sincerity abides are few indeed; those who speak falsely flow like a torrent. If a minister thus serves his lord, the lord will doubt. If a son thus speaks to his father, the father will doubt. When brothers, friends, husband and wife interact in such a manner, there is nowhere doubt does not arise. Once the mind of calculation sprouts, even gulls and crows will not alight—how much less men, how much less spirits and gods?\n\nYou, who do not deceive yourself, are true and without falsehood. Though you do not speak of sincerity, sincerity abides of itself. What need is there for ornamentation? The *Book of Changes* says: *\"Guard against deceit to preserve sincerity.\"* The meaning of these two characters begins here. Do you understand? Remember this well.\n\n**Record of the Hall of Familial Harmony**\nThe *Record of the Hall of Familial Harmony* serves to clarify human relationships. Among the great bonds of humanity, none is greater than loving one’s kin. To love one’s kin is for the father to be a father, the son to be a son, the elder brother to be an elder brother, the younger brother to be a younger brother, the husband to be a husband, the wife to be a wife. Thus, in the *Rites of Zhou*, the Grand Steward instructed the king to govern the myriad people through eight principles, the first of which was *\"cherish one’s kin.\"*\n\nTruly, for the father to be a father, the son a son, the elder brother an elder brother, the younger brother a younger brother, the husband a husband, the wife a wife—this is the foundation of human relationships. This is why the Grand Steward, in governing the myriad people, must first speak of cherishing one’s kin. Cherishing one’s kin is the root of teaching the people.\n\nIn the flourishing eras of the Three Dynasties, human relationships were clear among the high, and the common folk were harmonious below. Filial piety, kindness, fraternal love, and deference were practiced in harmony and humility. This was not a matter of cultivation or innate nature—it was the teaching of the sages, achieved without sternness.\n\nFrom the Qin and Han onward, governance relied entirely on expediency, heedless of propriety. The ancient sages’ teachings on fostering kinship among the people were entirely abandoned. Thus, the great principles of order were not established, rites and righteousness were not illuminated, and the world daily descended into deceitful conduct, its ills beyond remedy. Fathers and sons no longer dwelt together, brothers could not tolerate one another, moral instruction was severed, and the customs of the state were corrupted, until the world no longer knew the meaning of kinship.\n\nThus, the people of antiquity were pure; the people of today are cunning. The people of antiquity were sincere; the people of today are shallow. Is it that the people of today are inferior to those of old? Only if a sage like Yao or Shun, like Yu or Tang, like King Wen, King Wu, the Duke of Zhou, or Confucius were to arise, upholding and preserving their virtue, so that fathers and sons, brothers, husbands and wives might understand the meaning of their roles—only then might the customs of high antiquity be glimpsed again in our time.\n\nNow, under the unified sagely court, governance is guided by benevolence. The sagely words are proclaimed, with filial piety and obedience foremost among the virtues encouraged for the people. Villages and towns are permitted to recommend those who exemplify these virtues, that they may be known.\n\nThe spirits rejoice, leaping and exclaiming in delight. Hearing of this from all directions, the people naturally transform themselves. Some are renowned for their chastity and fidelity, others for their virtuous widowhood. Gates of righteousness and arches of filial piety stand everywhere, each with its exemplars. Yet despite these offerings, the gods remain as if unhearing—knowing the customs remain corrupt, this brings shame upon the divine. The spirits cannot remain silent at such a time. They command the villagers to repair this hall. To the east of the main hall, a chamber is built to honor the kin of the gods, cherishing those they hold dear. Thus, it is named the Hall of Kinship and Harmony. When those who come to the temple ascend this hall, gaze upon these images, the heart of kinship and harmony may naturally arise within them.\n\nThe hall is completed, and this record is made to illuminate human relationships. From this day forward, let fathers be kind and instructive, let sons be filial and admonishing; let elder brothers be friendly and respectful, let younger brothers be reverent and obedient; let husbands be harmonious and righteous, let wives be gentle and upright. Strive on, strive on—may you not be unworthy of this hall’s name.\n\nIn the third month, the first day of the gui-chou, the jia-wu year of the Zhiyuan era.\n\n*Record of the Divine and Efficacious Perfected Lord Jingxian of Biefeng.*\n\n---\n\nMoreover, to the east of the main hall of the Divine Efficacy Palace stands a hall, its plaque inscribed with the words *Kinship and Harmony*. A scholar, gathering his robes and ascending the hall, inquired: \"Does *kinship and harmony* not refer to what the stele inscription calls ‘harmony with the kin of father and mother’—that is, one’s relatives?\"\n\nI replied: \"Indeed.\"\n\nHe continued: \"From great-grandfather down to great-grandson—are these not the kin of the father?\"\n\nI again replied: \"Indeed.\"\n\nHe further asked: \"The mother’s brothers are called uncles, and the mother’s cousins are called maternal cousins—are these not the kin of the mother?\"\n\nI again replied: \"Indeed.\"\n\nThe scholar then sighed and said: \"Man, born between heaven and earth, is the most spiritually endowed of creatures. What distinguishes him from birds and beasts is his knowledge of the kinship of his father’s and mother’s kin. If one knows the kinship of one’s father’s and mother’s kin, then harmony follows. Yet if one must rely on these two words—*kinship and harmony*—to be known among others, what is the true intent behind this?\"\n\nI said: \"Well said! Do you understand? In today’s world, customs are governed by cunning and deceit, neglecting proper order, abandoning ritual and righteousness, discarding integrity and shame. That people still know harmony with the kin of their father and mother—I cannot yet believe it. Since the decline of the southern and northern courts, the way of filial piety and brotherly love has been lost. The *Tangdi* ode is forgotten, and the bonds of brotherhood are severed. Who still chants the *Lisi* ode, praising the virtue of descendants? Who still sings the *Taoyao* poem, celebrating the bride who brings harmony to her household? When fat lambs are prepared to hasten the arrival of uncles, when plump bulls are offered to welcome maternal kin—who still recites the *Famu* ode? Mencius said: ‘One without a heart of deference and yielding is not human.’ Thus, my heart is restless with what I desire, for silence is not permissible. To the people of Qin, the plumpness or leanness of the people of Yue stirs no concern in their hearts. Therefore, today’s discourse must be inscribed in writing, proclaimed in speech, and grounded in antiquity to enlighten them. Perhaps then the heavenly principle in human hearts—though as tenuous as a thread—may yet be unbroken, continuous, and still possess a way to be preserved and restored. This is what the ancients called *transformation*.\n\nFor the present age, nothing surpasses verbal transmission; for future generations, nothing surpasses the written word. Yet if the ancients had lived in a time when their Way could be practiced, there would have been no need for writing or speech. Speech arises only from necessity.\"\n\nThe scholar said: \"Truly, it is so.\"\n\nHere the translation follows:\n\n---\n\nNow, what is spoken of as the \"Sacred Father,\" the \"Sacred Mother,\" the \"Sacred Elder Brother\"—these are the divine kin, and do they not embody the spirit of the *Nansha* and *Tangdi* odes? As for the \"Sacred Son,\" the \"Sacred Nephew,\" the \"Sacred Grandson,\" even the \"Sacred Uncle\" and the \"Sacred Son-in-Law\"—these too are divine kin, and do they not further reflect the essence of the *Zhongsi*, *Famu*, and *Taoyao* poems?\n\nYet though the divine call these kin, I know well they are but the kin of parents’ clans—kin in the eyes of the gods, but what of the common world?\n\nI said: \"How rigid, how foolish! You cite the *Record of Rites* in your question, yet I take you for a scholar\n\nOnce, it bore the title \"Responsive to Devotion\"; now, it is called \"Numinous Aid\"—such is the origin of its name. Yet what I speak of is not some power to sway men with fortune or misfortune, nor can I escape the duty of giving voice to its story. Though its shrine’s construction may be grand, surpassing that of former times, it is still insufficient to stir the gaze of later generations. Thus, we undertook a thorough renovation: repainting in five colors, sculpting the divine images, adorning them with yellow curtains and vermilion tables, lending them a measure of solemn dignity. By reckoning the years, this was the fifth year of Xianchun, in the cyclical year *jisi* (1269).\n\nAlas! Man is the most spirited of all creatures, and who does not know the love of parents, cherishing them all their lives? Yet when it comes to ancestors, that love fades and is forgotten—how much more so for those of higher generations? Those who till the land, labor as artisans or merchants, or even aspire to be scholars, ought to trace the origins of their forebears, restoring their legacy rather than dismissing it as a relic of the past, fit only for idle chatter in some book-lined study. Though all who read and grasp the principles of virtue may be called scholars, I dare not compare ordinary men to the likes of Yi Yin, who rose from the fields of Shen, or Fu Yue, who was discovered while building walls—these were sages of their age. Even the emperors of the Han, who won the realm from horseback, welcomed the counsel of peddlers and butchers, inscribing their merits on bronze tripods and recording their names in history. How could such achievements be the sole province of those who read and understand the Dao?\n\nIn my humble view, when the Qin dynasty brought ruin, men took refuge in obscurity to preserve their lives. But today, the state nurtures scholars through education, summons the worthy by edict, and sets forth clear paths for advancement. Whether one is a farmer, artisan, or merchant, all may be drawn upward to become scholars. Thus, I dare to set down this account, to encourage those who would follow that path. Some may call this hall a village study, a place for warming the *Li Ke* sacrifices—such talk is but the prattle of rustics from Qi’s eastern wilds; pay it no heed.\n\nIn the third year of the *Dade* reign (1299), on the auspicious day of the mid-autumn month, the *Shefeng* Mountain Recluse wrote this. *Composed on behalf of the Elder of Dong Village, the Record of the Numinous Aid Palace.*\n\nIn my youth, I was driven by a bold and restless spirit, chasing after fame and office. I shouldered my provisions and traveled thousands of miles, visiting every majestic and wondrous place under heaven, leaving no trace of the ancients unexamined. Just as I was lost in reflection, a letter arrived from my scholar-friend Zhang Guilong, presenting me with *The Collected Writings of Numinous Aid*. He wrote: \"In the indigo hills of Min, there stands an ancient temple called Numinous Aid. Its deities bear the surname Xu—one enfeoffed as the King of Jiang, the other as the King of Rao. Since the Kaiyun era of the Later Jin, over four hundred years have passed, and their merits in aiding the state and pacifying the people, in warding off disasters and repelling calamities, are too numerous to recount. Yet of late, the temple has fallen into disrepair, unworthy of its divine radiance.\"\n\nIn the summer of the guisi year, Zhang Guilong, along with Shen Jianweng, Zhou Quan, Zhou Yong, Ming Linchun, Guo Yongweng, and Zheng Ruxian—seven men in all—jointly resolved to restore the temple and consulted the deities through divination. The gods manifested their presence, transforming brushstrokes into script, entrusting the task to them and renewing the edifice in radiant splendor. By the eighth month, the work was completed, and the deities again descended through the brush, recounting their deeds in sequence to compose this record. They revealed fortune and misfortune through hexagrams, exhorted loyalty, trust, ritual, and righteousness through prose and verse. Every word and phrase echoed the intent of Confucius and Mencius in their teachings for the ages. Such are the gods—wise, luminous, and upright—that even the brush of Ban Mengjian in the Western Capital, the *Three Capitals* of Zuo Taichong, the *Five Blessings* of Yang Ziyun, or the odes to sacred mushrooms and precious tripods, the hymns of yellow steeds and jade tablets, cannot compare. With gods so manifest, how could one dare to neglect them? The seven gentlemen, Zhang and his companions, reverently received the deities’ words and inscribed the record upon stone. The local scholar Lin Digong Yannian transcribed it, while I was entrusted with engraving the title in seal script.\n\nIn the twelfth month, the deities bestowed an ancient poem, saying: *\"The stele now stands—today’s affair is for you to record, for such is the will of the gods.\"* Before I could take up my brush, they granted another poem, this one spanning ancient and modern times, sixty-five stanzas in all. Among them were the lines: *\"Where the record endures, so too does the name; you may forget, but the gods do not.\"* I dared not refuse and thus composed this account of their words:\n\n*Of old, there were sacrifices—now, there is transmission.*\n*Of old, there were decrees—now, there is proclamation.*\n*Ancient writings exhort to virtue.*\n*The temple stands renewed, its affairs complete.*\n*Rain and shine respond to the dual heavens.*\n*The people pray with ever-deepening reverence.*\n*This inscription I carve to endure ten thousand years.*\n*May the world never forget, for virtue knows no change.*\n\n**Record of the Yüqìng Hall Daoist Sanctuary**\n\nThus have I heard. The Buddha has a gatha:\n*\"All things arise from the mind—where in the mind are they sought?\"*\nAnd why? Because *\"the mind itself is Buddha.\"*\nWhat is Buddha? The *Shi* explains: *Fu* means \"person.\"\nIf not for the person, there would be no embodied form.\nEternally real, without truth, without form,\nWithout patience, without hindrance, without substance,\nWithout coming or going, without entanglement—\nThus, thus, there is nothing to be settled.\nWhere is the person who does not understand?\nOne who exhaustively investigates the mind will find\nThe Buddha present at all times.\nIf the mind is otherwise, mere recitation of prajñā,\nEmpty talk, false guidance, greed for gain, and deceitful merit—\nThese are far inferior.\nEven when the great chiliocosm crumbles,\nHow much less can the Buddha’s single sanctuary endure?\n\nSince the Jingde and Xiangfu eras, the Buddha’s meritorious deeds have been renowned throughout the world. In every place, Daoist sanctuaries were established, each adorned with painted and sculpted Buddha images, revered with incense and offerings. Our village’s Yüqìng Hall is one such sanctuary. From the Kaixi bingyin year to the Yuanzhen bingshen year, reckoned by the Xia calendar, ninety-odd years have passed. Though not so distant in time, why has the sanctuary fallen into such disrepair, far inferior to its former state? Its roof leaks, its walls are breached, and damp rot lingers unaddressed.\n\nThose who pass by—though they have eyes, none turn to look; though they have hands, none point in recognition. Truly, it is like the people of Yue gazing upon the sacrifices of distant tribes, unmoved by whether they are fat or lean.\n\nYet do they not reflect that the labors of the ancients—hauling water, carrying firewood—were not accomplished in a single morning or evening? Thus did the Buddha’s vow declare: \"All buddhas arise in the world from mountain huts, unbothered by the nests of magpies upon their necks.\" With this illusory, fleeting body, I cannot idly occupy the land of kings or covet fine terrain. So I came to dwell in a stone chamber among the cliffs of Nan’an. The rise of Yüqìng Hall adds nothing to the Buddha’s realm, nor does its ruin take anything away. Yet by the Buddha’s wisdom, all are as these people. If such is the case, then their hearts are but yakṣas and rākṣasas—how can they be spoken to of the Buddha?\n\nMaster Zhigong of the Tang once met the Venerable Bodhisattva in the Yellow Cloud Mountains to expound the Dharma. A mendicant from Mount Song rose from his seat, bowed, and knelt to ask: \"In the degenerate age, by what karma do sentient beings fall into *sahā*, suffering for kalpas on end? What expedient means can save them?\" Zhigong replied: \"In the latter days, those who do evil are many, while those who form karmic bonds are few.\" The Venerable Bodhisattva said: \"These sentient beings bring it upon themselves.\" Truly, these words are true.\n\nNow I broadly expound the Dharma for all beings, universally guiding them to awakening. If there are good men and good women who can arouse the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, and with the seven treasures filling worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges offer them in generosity—without deluded thoughts, without attachment, without retreat—then by this cause and condition, the adornment of the Buddha-land’s merit and virtue: can it be measured? I do not speak falsely. These are true words, real words. Listen carefully now, and take the Buddha as your heart.\n\nThen he raised the Buddha’s verse again:\n*\"I have a single root of goodness,*\n*All born within the heart.\"*\nDo you understand? Thus it is said: *\"The mind itself is the Buddha.\"*\n\nIn the third year of the Qiandao era, the Buddha bestowed upon Dingguang the title *Yuanying Putong Ciji Dashi Bodhisattva*, commonly called the White-Robed Sage Duke, or the Pan’gu Dingguang Buddha. I dare to compose this record of Yüqìng Hall for the Buddha, to be inscribed before the hall and exhort the world.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Laibin Pavilion**\n\nWhen the request was made for Han Wengong to compose an inscription, many lamented not seeing his true portrait. I alone rejoiced. Little did they know that Wengong’s words so vividly captured the spirit and form of his subjects that, by grasping his intent, the true likeness becomes clear before one’s eyes. This is why I rejoice—understanding Wengong’s purpose in establishing the pavilion.\n\nMoreover, all things decay, yet literature alone endures. How true this is!\n\nThe lyrics of the Perfected One of Lingji were already exquisite in their beauty and perfection. Yet there remained a gap in the wall to be mended. Measuring it with a handboard, I found it to span over seventy tablets. Several gentlemen exhausted their efforts to complete it, then asked me to provide the painting. I considered it from afar and said: \"A wall standing alone in the open sky is vulnerable to the ravages of wind and rain. In time, it will surely crumble. If you wish to preserve Wengong’s record, that would suffice. Should the painting perish, at least my record may endure. For later generations who seek to recount this, let it be said: it is the record that matters, not merely the record.\"\n\nNow, in this era of sagely unity, the radiance of imperial might shines forth. The southern seas and all their realms present tribute. Gods and men rejoice, and the world once more knows peace. I dare to offer this painting as celebration for our time.\n\nAt its center stands a pavilion, its plaque reading *Laibin* (\"Receiving Guests\"). Before and behind it, scholar trees are planted, forming a \"Scholar Tree Market.\" To its east and west stand two arches, one named *Yuejin* (\"Delighting in the Near\"), the other *Huaiyuan* (\"Cherishing the Distant\")—such are the names given to them. The peaks rise steeply, the crags loom dark and wild. The post road stretches far, and travelers tread its path without cease, one following another.\n\nHere the forms of the southern seas’ myriad barbarian folk are depicted: two men mounted on elephants, called \"barbarian officials.\" Beneath each barbarian official stands one who bears the seal. Four men, able to tame the elephants with golden hooks, are called \"elephant slaves,\" also named \"elephant lords.\" One man holds the banner of *Bearing Treasures* and stands to the left; another holds the banner of *Presenting Gifts* and bows to the right. Two chariots are drawn, with four charioteers, two umbrella-bearers, and two interpreters. The rest of their clansmen go barefoot, their torsos bared. Among them, thirty-six men gird themselves with five-colored woven cloth. The treasures they offer are called *Primordial Tortoises*, *Elephant Tusks*, *Great Bribes*, *Southern Gold*, *Penetrating Rhinoceros Horn*, *Patterned Armor*, *Kingfisher Plumes*, *White Silver*, and fragrant woods such as *sandal*, *aloes*, and *clove*. There are also rare marvels, strange wonders, exquisite luxuries, and precious rarities prized by the world—such as the *Jade Disc of He*, the *Pearl of Marquis Sui*, and corals like the *Stone-Crushing Coral Tree*. Some fashion platters of gold, vats of silver, basins of glass, curtains of true pearls, and pagodas of the Seven Treasures. Laden on carts and palanquins, wrapped in mats and felt bundles, they cross seas and scale ridges, arriving in leisurely procession to amass before the pavilion. Gleaming and resplendent, their colors shimmer and blur, intersecting and scattering in disarray—beyond all counting.\n\nThose who present regional tributes must be organized as the *Zhou Rituals* prescribes under the *Huai Fang* office: eight officers, four treasurers, four scribes, four attendants, and four laborers, each with their assigned duties, their roles apportioned according to their abilities. Who would claim that only two supervisors—one chief and one deputy, with two attendants—could suffice? I observe these men: unless they possess talents surpassing ordinary men, how could they manage such affairs alone?\n\nAs for the pines encircling the paper mulberry grove and the willows flanking the road, they enclose an area of several dozen paces. Viewed from afar, their forms seem to sketch and vanish in an instant—distant, fleeting, evoking clouds and mountains ten thousand *li* away. The market bridge stretches like a sash, the creek flows like a ribbon of silk. Adorned with jade balustrades and vermilion railings, their carved craftsmanship exquisite, they stand tall and orderly, perfectly aligned. At their center rises a depiction of the Five Great Marshals—Zha, Bian, Zhao, and Diao—emerging in martial array. Valiant warriors lead the vanguard, cavalry guards the rear. Their radiance blazes, their martial presence crackles with authority. This is how the civil and martial deities manifest their power to govern the spirits of the underworld, repay the grace of the state above, safeguard this land below, and bestow blessings upon the people.\n\nYet this painting could not have been conceived in a single day or night; its creation was surely laborious. Though I admire it, I must compose this record in the manner of Master Wen to preserve its essence. What harm then if wind and rain erode it over time? Future gentlemen who attend to this place will surely read this record. In reading it, they will preserve the painting. In preserving the painting, they will extol the great dynasty’s majestic virtue—vast as the heavens’ height, profound as the earth’s depth, radiant as the sun and moon. As for the Nine Yi, Eight Di, Ten Jie, Six Man, and the remote frontiers beyond the seas—all are encompassed within its dominion. The seasonal tributes and envoys who hasten here as guests from every quarter cannot be fully chronicled by this record or this painting alone.\n\nIn the year of *tingtan*, on an autumn night when the sky was clear and the moon shone bright as day, the Hermit of Biefeng Mountain inscribed the events of the *Pavilion of Welcoming Guests* and its mural, carving it at the Lingji Palace.\n\n**Inscription for the Qilong Mountain Spirit Shrine**\n\nQilong Mountain, an offshoot of Biefeng, bears a temple called the *Hall of Rain-Praying Kings*, also known as the *Dragon Gate Society*—the local shrine of the Lingji Palace’s royal procession. In the seventh year of the Song dynasty’s *Xuanhe* reign, the year *yisi*, from summer through autumn, no rain fell. The fields withered, the people toiled, and the fine grain faced ruin. No deity was left uninvoked—yet would they not heed our pleas?\n\nThus did the village elders and longtime residents speak among themselves: \"To the east of the lane stands a temple, home to the deity known as the *Guardian of the Realm, Responsive and Efficacious King*—a spirit who wards off calamity and repels misfortune, whose blessings upon the people are vast, and whose divine aid has never been wanting. Now that the drought has grown dire, how can we delay the rites of sacrificial beasts and jade offerings?\" On the *renshen* day of the seventh month, at the first light of dawn, they purified themselves and hastened in earnest to the temple courtyard to perform the sacrifices. The deity, moved by the people’s innocence, responded as swiftly as an echo or a shadow. In an instant, clouds and mist rolled in from all directions, thunder and lightning arrived, and a torrential downpour descended. Gazing toward the southern slopes of the mountain, they suddenly beheld a shimmering divine dragon, above which a yellow banner fluttered, emblazoned with the five characters: *Guardian of the Realm, Responsive and Efficacious King*. This title was none other than the former honorific of the present *Spirit of Lingji*.\n\nThree days later, on *jiayin*, the skies cleared. That autumn, the harvest was abundant, the rice yield doubled, and the once-parched fields teemed with life, their granaries overflowing. The farmers and elders, facing north, leapt and danced in reverence, bowing and prostrating themselves, their joy unbounded, their hearts brimming with gratitude.\n\nIn the eleventh month, on the winter solstice, the sovereign personally established an altar upon the bend of Qilong Mountain, where monthly sacrifices were offered in repayment of the deity’s virtue. After a full cycle of sixty years, a temple was erected—its halls grand and spacious, a perpetual abode for the spirit, enduring through the ages. Qilong, a mountain of renown, was thus revealed as the site where the gods first manifested beneath its banner. When the people prayed for rain, rain came; the deity never failed in wisdom or response. The community petitioned the authorities, and so the temple was named the *Hall of Rain-Praying Kings*, also called the *Dragon Gate Society*. This is the very aspiration of the village’s finest and most loyal, those who cherish merit and renown.\n\nFor mountains, forests, valleys, and hills that bring forth clouds and wind or reveal strange phenomena are all called *shen*—spirits. According to the rites of sacrifice, they are duly recorded in the canon of worship. Now that this deity has manifested through Qilong’s timely rains, transforming barrenness into sweetness and turning pestilence into harmony, the people have been revived, their lives restored. For four hundred years, the temple has received offerings, and who among the people would dare forget or grow negligent in their devotion?\n\nYet time passes swiftly; the shrine has fallen into disrepair, its images faded, no longer befitting the radiance of the divine. The temple keepers, Lin Chun and others, having received abundant blessings from the spirit, reflected upon the past with a sense of unfulfilled duty. They consulted the villagers and resolved to restore it. When they prayed to the deity, the spirit accepted their sincerity. A divine bird descended to inscribe characters—seal script and clerical forms, strange and wondrous—at first indecipherable. They then requested a transcription in common script. The prose, composed in parallel couplets, could now be heard and understood, as if someone had been present all along, though none had noticed.\n\nIn the first month of the new *Yuanzhen* era, on an auspicious day, the people of neighboring hamlets east and west joined forces, pooling their resources in harmony. They commissioned artisans to complete the work, renewing the old with the new. On the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month, *guihai*—the day before the beginning of spring in the following year—on the morrow of *jiazi*, the project was finished. They entreated me to compose this record.\n\nAs for me, how could I dare to boast or flatter, seeking favor with others? Humbly, I have set down these words, that the deity may forever be venerated in this land and eternally receive its due offerings.\n\nLong life, wealth, peace, and ease—these are the wishes of all people, and I shall surely grant them.\n\nAs for the noble lineage, titles, and origins of this deity, they are fully recorded on the stele of Lingji Palace to the east of the lane; even a hundred generations hence, they may be known. My name is carved in stone—what more need I say? I merely set this down to record the Lingji Traveling Shrine on Qilong Mountain, known as the Rain-Praying King’s Palace.\n\n*Self-preface by Lingji Perfected Immortal of Biefeng.*\n\n**Record of the Temple of Lingji Worthy and Sage King**\n\nThe stele of the Temple of Lingji Worthy and Sage King—this stele stands to ensure that his merit and virtue are never forgotten.\n\nSince the *Xiangfu* era, the deity’s responses to prayers and exorcisms, along with his supplications at the eastern shrine of Longshou Temple, have led to his imperial enfeoffment as the Worthy and Sage of the Three Celestial Jade Towers. The Perfected Immortal of High Inspection, Gaoxian Weiling Guangji—later incarnation of Lingji—though venerated in the sacrificial canon, had no formal liturgical composition.\n\nDuring the *Shaoxing* reign, the realm was divided into western, southern, and northern domains. In the sixth year, *jiachen*, the northern temple was grandly constructed, and the villagers, led by Lin □, recorded its history—ninety-eight years in all. Though the temple had nearly fallen into ruin, it was revived, and the names of its benefactors remain traceable. Counting the years, sixty-seven more have now passed.\n\nIn the third year of the *Dade* era, on the eighth day before the spring community sacrifice, Zeng Chen, Fu Long, and others, leading their fellow villagers, carried a single incense censer and hastened to perform rites in the eastern courtyard of the temple. They prayed to me, saying: \"This temple has long been abandoned. We wish to restore it but have not yet received an auspicious divination and dare not proceed.\" I admonished them, saying: \"It is auspicious.\" They then entreated me to compose an inscription for its stele, and I could not refuse.\n\nThe prayer reads:\n\nIn this era of imperial unity, the realm enjoys great peace. Daoist sanctuaries and Buddhist monasteries—all neglected things are now revived. The village establishes its altar, and the deity dwells in tranquility.\n\nIn the year of *Yuanxian*, the Dipper’s handle points to *yin*. The time for sacrifice arrives, and the rites are performed with utmost clarity. Yet the images are dim, their forms obscured. Tiles crumble, walls are defiled, and wind and rain batter them. Fearful and anxious, we seem to have failed in our duty. Thus, we consulted the people and divined by the gods. We cast yarrow and tortoiseshell, weighing the long and the short, the before and the after. Hesitant and uncertain, we placed our trust in me alone.\n\nIn obscurity, without sound or form, how dare I boast or deceive, misleading the ears of others? Yet I depend on this benevolent land—what more can I say?\n\nThe script turns from seal to clerical, from fish to bird. On the *yichou* day of the second month, an auspicious day and hour, earthworkers and carpenters set to their tasks. They trimmed flaws, filled cracks, restored the old, and enhanced the new. They adorned it with whitewash and painted it with cinnabar and azure. Assistants and attendants, above, correspond to the four stars. If the people act with virtue, they shall receive blessings and prosperity. The two steps bear the shields and plumes, guarding the village and its neighbors.\n\nThe six lords, adorned with pearls and jade, perform wondrous dances to the sound of reed pipes and songs. The *Yunmen* ninefold music resounds, and the *Fangzhang* eight delicacies are arrayed. A hundred entertainers, their forms lifelike and fierce, perform. Spectators fill the roads, their carriages lined side by side. Laughter and joy abound, their faces alight with happiness. The work is completed with ease, and I record it in writing.\n\nMy words are coarse and unrefined, like one clutching their chest in distress. Who am I? The Perfected Immortal Lingji. To the east of Longshou Temple, this record is inscribed on the stele.\n\nHeaven deems him worthy and sage; my later incarnation bears the surname Pan. His given name is known through his blessings. A direct descendant of the *Chengyu* lineage, he first entered Min. Clad in the robes of office, he was once recommended as a filial and incorrupt candidate. The imperial commissioner, Marquis Liu, honored him with silk and a rush-wheeled carriage. Though repeatedly summoned, he declined, holding wealth and rank as floating clouds. He chose to dwell on Biefeng, carving fields from the earth. Upright and pure, he felt no shame in partaking of simple fare.\n\nHis immortal bones were extraordinary; he studied under *Wochuan*. From Dragon Peak, he received a scroll, emerging from the blue and entering the mysterious. West of the Gorge River, where flying waters seethe, he walked upon the void without wetting or drowning. The world was astonished, the age amazed—his deeds touched the unseen.\n\nWeary of the clamor of the world, he made himself known through the Dao. \"To hear the Way in the morning is to die content\"—thus did he return to his true nature. One day, he transformed like a molting cicada. After the *Qiande* era, he appeared in dreams. Once his transgressions were purged, timely rains answered his prayers. The five grains flourished, bringing benefit to the people. The people, grateful and joyful, offered autumn sacrifices and winter provisions.\n\nBefore the temple’s establishment, sacrifices were held in the great courtyard. According to the old plaque, this began in the *Shaoxing* era. The temple was built with reverence, its reputation resplendent. In the first year of *Shaoding*, the hall was near collapse. Restoring its former grandeur required great effort. Only the worthy may approach sageliness, truly earning their illustrious title. The people exalt his virtue, and the authorities preserve it. If the divine is made manifest, listen with singular devotion.\n\nFrom this day forth, the sage may be venerated as Heaven. As for me, Lingji, my deeds have fulfilled the three thousand. Possessing all, I match the Three Spirits. On the *wu* day, most auspicious, the offerings are pure with pepper and fragrance. \"The people, too, are weary\"—this truly accords with my heart.\n\nInscribed in stone, this record shall endure for a thousand ages. I rely on the restoration of wonders, for without people, there is no cause. I humbly hope for imperial enfeoffment, that eight characters may shine with glory. With hands clasped in reverence, I bow my head—may the Son of Heaven live ten thousand years!\n\n**Record of the Temple of the Minister of Agriculture and the Community Corner Shrine**\n\nOnce, while attending the Heavenly Laba Festival, I lingered on my return. Suddenly, a guest appeared—girded with gold, robed in purple—standing beneath the hall. He cried out in a stern voice: \"Alive, one is a man; dead, one becomes a ghost. To be a gentleman’s ghost is to never dare bring misfortune upon others. To be a petty man’s ghost is to lack efficacy.\"\n\n\"The western temple has its record; the southern and northern have their steles. I shall soon rot away like grass and wood.\" Hearing his words, I ordered my attendants to bring him forward. He was an upright deity, the god of the Community Corner Shrine.\n\nI descended, took his hand, and led him up, saying: \"Had you not spoken, I would have nearly lost you. Wearing stitched robes and a ceremonial cap, one finds it hard to journey to Yue. In this age, only the wicked and the richly powerful may establish themselves. Only those who calculate to the finest detail may secure their livelihood. Your duty is to open the land for agriculture.\"\n\n\"In spring one plows, in summer one weeds; in autumn one reaps, in winter one stores. Throughout the year, toil knows no rest, not a day of peace. The gates of Heaven lie ten thousand li away—who would be the one to plead for your distant cares and beg for mercy? Who is Changfang that he dare command and drive you? The magpie’s numinous power did not spare it from being painted to fill the river; the tortoise’s numinous power did not spare it from the agony of propping up a bed. Why does the cock not crow? Why does the dog not bark? Why does the ox pant? Why is the horse exhausted? How exacting is your reproach!\n\n\"Can one truly expect the private prayers of a pig’s trotter and a bowl of wine? Yet even so, the farmer does not cease to plow because of flood or drought. You oversee the duty of agriculture—how can you dwell in ease and delight in your office? Why must you angle for fame and fish for reputation, adopting the ways of the vulgar world?\n\n\"From this year onward, if the harvests are bountiful, then the sacrifices will be most luminous—how could it stop at a hundred generations? They shall endure as long as Heaven and Earth. In admiration of your ability, I inscribe the plaque: *Temple of the Controller of Agriculture and the Community Corner Shrine.*\n\n\"As for the temple’s origins, it was first moved here from Five Blessings Crag, and many years have passed since. The dates of its renovations are recorded on the beams, so I shall not belabor them here. Written in the year of *sheti ge*, on the second day after the Heavenly Laba Festival, by the Man of Turtle Peak Mountain.\n\n*Record of the Temple of the Controller of Crops and the Dragon Mountain Elder*\nThe lord’s surname was Gong, his given name Chengzan, a remnant subject of Wang Rong of Futang. In the fourth year of Qianning of the Tang, he passed the *hongci* examination and rose to the highest ranks of office. During the chaos of the Five Dynasties, the realm was carved up by heroes and warlords.\"\n\nAmidst national peril and political chaos, when moral winds had decayed and customs grown shallow, the lord abandoned his wife and children, left his ancestral tombs, concealed his brilliance, and refused to serve the times. He journeyed north to White Deer Mountain, traversing lofty peaks and perilous passes, until he chose to build his dwelling halfway up Turtle Peak, naming it Flag Dragon Mountain. There, the land lay level and expansive, with secluded waters and limpid streams, allowing him to fulfill his resolve.\n\nThe Min king, surnamed Wang, sent gifts of silk and treasure to summon him, yet he would not bend to serve. During the Yonglong era, when the Wang brothers turned against one another in internal strife, routed soldiers scattered like stars, fleeing eastward into the mountains and forests. Hearing of the lord’s lofty integrity, they passed by his gate without daring to enter.\n\nIn the Tianfu era of the Jin, when Tang forces marched south in punitive campaign, the elders of the village, fearing the chaos would turn to cruelty, begged the Tang army to exterminate them. The lord donned Tang robes and cap, and paid homage to the two kings—now the Divine Perfected of Numinous Aid. When the king reclaimed his throne and offered him a position in the幕府, the lord declined the salary. Instead, he carved fields from the mountainside, tilling and sowing himself. In years of abundance, when the grain was fine, he would provide for his neighbors who lacked enough in spring.\n\nA humane man’s intent is carved in ten thousand mouths as a stele.\n\nIn the eighth year of Tianfu, one day, a shooting star suddenly fell beside his dwelling. The lord, knowing his allotted span complete, received the villagers’ joint veneration, his incense smoke ascending. He donated the fields he had tilled and sown to the communal mountain endowment, to be held in perpetuity for ancestral rites. Hoping the Divine Perfected of Numinous Aid would guard this land, he was granted a shared place at their table. Tasked with overseeing the harvest, he governed the rains and sunshine, tended the cattle and livestock. From beginning to end, he discharged his duties with diligence. As the years passed, the shrine halls fell into disrepair; the village elders pooled their strength to rebuild and renew them.\n\nWhen winds and rains came in season, the five grains flourished, livestock multiplied, and the sounds of chickens and dogs filled the air—these were the blessings the elders received under his shelter, not for a single day alone. If fathers were kind and sons filial, elder brothers friendly and younger brothers respectful, husbands virtuous and wives chaste, who else could have brought about such harmony if not the lord? Was he not a disciple of Zheng Zizhen and Yan Junping?\n\nO spirit of the lord, I have been asked to record this. I dare to set forth his life’s path, that later generations may know it.\n\nOn the *la* day of the twelfth month in the second year of Dade, recorded by the Old Man of Biefeng, Xu Zi.\n\n**Record of the Hall of United Spring**\n\nOn the evening of the great autumnal purification rite in the year of *Yuanxiu*, a villager named So-and-so came bearing incense and prayed to me, saying: \"For seventy or eighty years, my humble dwelling has been the dilapidated house of my ancestors. There was once a wooden plaque that read *Hall of Extended Blessings*, but it has long been buried in dust and neglect, its luster faded. I wished to renew it but could not. Now, admiring your resolve to honor such an ancestral intent and bring it to fruition, I have ordered my attendants to grind a thick ink of *Chuanmo* and fashion a brush from reeds. In one breath, I inscribed it—characters as large as a dou—reading *United Spring*.\n\nWhat is *United Spring*? It is the spring that pervades all things between heaven and earth. The sluggish stir, the submerged rise, the hooked sprout, the armored split—all swell and fill, all grow and mature. Who brings this to pass? Do you understand the meaning of spring?\"\n\nI replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nRetiring to reflect in private, I found no answer. Returning with my robe gathered, I said, \"Your servant is dull-witted. Pray, instruct me in these words.\"\n\n\"You ask what makes spring spring? There is heaven and earth. Man, born between them, is but one thing among many. If spring does not even know why it is spring, how can man comprehend it? Ah, how stubborn! Your words are confounding. Sit again, and I shall tell you.\n\nThe spring of heaven and earth *is* spring. The spring of man is this same spring. How could one seek spring outside of it? What is it, then? The spring of heaven and earth lies in its *qi*—warm and harmonious; in its nature—radiant and tender; in its *qi*—nurturing, sheltering, and protecting. This is why all things partake of spring. If the *qi* were scorching and harsh, that would be summer, not spring. If the nature were bleak and desolate, that would be autumn, not spring. If the intent were stern, urgent, and pressing, that would be winter, not spring. Without spring, what would become of things?\n\nMan is no different. You must understand this. Father as father, son as son, husband as husband, wife as wife, elder brother as elder brother, younger brother as younger brother—these are the great human relations. They must first take root in filial piety, kindness, fraternal love, harmony, and humility. Only when the root is firm and deep will the spring wind stir and move them: their branches will grow long, their leaves flourish, their blossoms bloom, and their fruits ripen. Otherwise, though spring rains water them day after day, it will be of no avail.\n\nThus, the root of man must be tended with care—planted with effort, entrusted to diligent nurturing—so that one may hope for growth, like the young shoots of a sapling. Extend this understanding to unite your household as one, and this will be a spring without spring, a spring in harmony with heaven and earth. How could it not swell and fill, grow and mature?\n\nHaving received these words, I was suddenly enlightened. Clutching the text, I returned home and hastily took up a brush to write it down. I instructed my family to prepare a feast—one dish, one cup—setting the table in the *Hall of United Spring*. Young and old gathered in order, toasting and urging one another, drinking and pausing. As I hovered between drunkenness and sobriety, I called for a servant to bring water for rinsing, then read the text aloud, making a humming sound for my family to hear. Clapping my hands, I declared, 'Though not yet drunk, I am fortunate that nothing troubles me. My heart truly knows the spring of this day! From today to tomorrow, and tomorrow to the next day—no day without spring. From this year to the next, and the next to a thousand, ten thousand years—what year will lack spring? I have found this spring, and you, too, have found it. May we never shame the name of this hall.'\n\nThe feast ended, and my family clapped their hands, rising with great laughter.\"\n\n*—Written by the Old Man of Biefeng.*\n\n---\n\n**Inscription for the Gate**\n\nWords must be loyal and sincere,\nDeeds must be earnest and respectful.\nRites must be solemn and reverent,\nDemeanor must be upright and proper.\nIn conduct toward oneself and others,\nOnly harmony and prudence suffice.\nEars, eyes, heart, and thoughts—\nI examine myself thrice daily.\nAdvancing knowledge and putting it into practice,\nOne may aspire to sagehood.\nIn affairs, emulate Yi and Zhou;\nIn virtue, follow Yan and Min.\nAccumulate goodness to transmit to your family,\nAnd blessings will surely overflow.\nInscribed upon this gate—\nLet your descendants heed these words.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Longevity and Heavenly Jade Cliff Daoist Sanctuary**\n\nThe Great Master of Universal Illumination of the Buddha’s Heart, Qingcong, styled *Stone Path*, was surnamed Bi by birth. A native of Youyang in Putian, his family had long followed the Confucian tradition. In his youth, he studied at the prefectural academy of Sanshan, where those he associated with were all eminent and outstanding scholars. When the imperial tombs were relocated and the celestial bodies dimmed, he abandoned his secular pursuits and entered the gate of emptiness.\n\nInitially, he received instruction under Master Heng Zhenwen of Dongshan and received the transmission from Master Guangzhi of Yuzhong. In character, the Master was inwardly luminous and outwardly harmonious, requiring no cultivation to refine himself. His mouth constantly recited Buddhist sutras, and as for Confucian texts, he never set them aside for a single day. Moreover, he was well-versed in the calligraphy of Zhong [You] and Wang [Xizhi], and at that time, his peers acclaimed him as the foremost among the Southern School’s White Eyebrows—who else but him?\n\nFrom Putian, the Master entered Fuzhou and first took residence at Yingtian Temple in Min, where he spent sixteen years. He often told others, “Among the eighty-four thousand dharma gates, one must first practice expedient means oneself.” He wished to establish another sanctuary but could not find a suitable place. Not far from Yingtian Temple, in the land known as *Niumingdi*, stood the former residence of Councilor Tang, which had been reduced to rubble after the ravages of war. In the *renchen* year of the Zhiyuan era (1292), the heirs of that estate offered the land for sale to the Master. Privately rejoicing, he said, “My karmic affinity with the Dao is no mere coincidence.” Thereupon, he donated his remaining robes and savings to purchase the site and began construction in earnest.\n\nOne day, accompanied by his friend, Master Chonglin Daohuan, he carried a volume of texts and surveyed the land, discerning the mountain’s dragon veins with the eye of dharma. Twin peaks rose like hair buns, vying in splendor to the north and south. North of the twin peaks, a path led eastward. The needle pointed to *qian* (northwest), then branched into two arms—one forming a stone arrangement resembling the character *pin* (品), its three faces jagged yet upright. Perhaps heaven and earth had nurtured this numinous formation, awaiting its destined purpose.\n\nDuring the Yongjia era of the Jin, a recluse surnamed Yu crossed the river and built his hut here. Inspired by the *pin*-shaped stones, he styled himself *Master of the Jade Pin Mountain*, and thus the mountain came to be called *Jade Pin*. *Jade Pin Mountain* was the mountain’s general name. From its summit, a vein emerged from the *pin* formation, winding like a wasp’s waist or a horse’s jaw. Midway, it branched into three peaks, towering and steadfast, their rounded summits firmly planted—these were named *Hanqi* (Shaking Marvel). Proceeding further, the path shifted with each step, its turns resembling oar strokes, and was called *Lianhua* (Lotus Flower). At its terminus, three ridges pressed into the earth, majestic and precipitous, forming the shape of an immortal’s grand seat.\n\nTo the east lay the *Eight Turtles Hall* and *Sizhou Bridge*; to the west, the *Qilin Grotto* and *Zhenwu Crag*. Above the *Mingtang* (Bright Hall) stood mountains named *Huxie* (Gourd Arbor), *Wushi Gang* (Crow Stone Ridge), and *Ancient Pine*. Around the mountain, twin emerald streams meandered in serpentine coils, their every inch spanning a thousand *li*, stretching endlessly into the distance. An outlying peak, *Fangshan* (Square Mountain), rose externally, while internally, *Tianzhu* (Heavenly Pillar) was erected as its support. Below *Tianzhu* lay Yingtian Temple. Two peaks leapt backward, enclosing the water’s tail like a gate, resembling oxen and horses drinking from the stream—playful and full of charm.\n\nSouth of the twin peaks, the path led to *Dazuo Feng* (Grand Seat Peak), *Yuyao Feng* (Jade Medicine Peak), and *Shuangtong Feng* (Twin Youths Peak). Below *Shuangtong* lay *Baotai Feng* (Treasure Terrace Peak), *Qiyun Feng* (Rising Cloud Peak), *Jinlan Feng* (Golden Rail Peak), *Sanlang Feng* (Third Son Peak), and *Chaoyang Feng* (Facing Sun Peak). These peaks stood in imposing array, their spires clashing like antlers. Beyond them, the horizon stretched unbroken in all four directions.\n\nWhen Master Yun of Zhishan’s *Bieshan* (Separate Mountain) Lodge visited, he composed a *gatha* on the *Ten Marvelous Peaks* to express his sentiments. All who climbed and explored the site could not help but praise it. Having acquired the land, the Master set about construction in grand fashion, orienting the sanctuary to face southeast with its back to the northwest. Pointing to the extraordinary site, he exclaimed, “Who has led me to delight in this land and take the initiative? Is this not the karmic affinity of a sanctuary?”\n\nThe Master’s conduct and practices astonished all who heard or saw him. Though he wished to conceal himself and leave no trace, he found that even in the absence of traces, concealment was impossible. The leading figures of various schools, unwilling to let him go, invited him to Dongyue Mountain Temple and presented him with hundreds of sheets of calligraphy. Dongyue Temple lay north of Fuzhou’s administrative seat, adjacent to the clamor of markets and dust. Those of shallow learning and limited vision who dwelled there were inevitably bound by attachments. Yet the Master’s nature was unadorned and free, devoid of form, thought, knowledge, or attainment. Only the thought of establishing a sanctuary never ceased; he longed to fulfill this aspiration but could not bear the burden alone.\n\nIn the *yiwei* year (1315), he entrusted his disciples, led by Master Long, to oversee the project. Construction began on a certain day, month, and *jiazi* cycle, with rituals performed and ground broken. Walls were raised and huts built atop the site, and the sanctuary was named *Shoutian Yuyan Daochang* (Longevity and Heavenly Jade Cliff Daoist Sanctuary). *Shoutian* (Longevity Heaven) shared the same lineage as *Yingtian* (Responding Heaven), while *Yuyan* (Jade Cliff) was derived from the name *Jade Pin Mountain*.\n\nAt its center stood a hall named *Yingji* (Responding to Opportunity). Behind the hall was the *Guanyin Hall*, and behind that, two chambers were built to honor his masters—one named *Dongshan Shouyu* (Longevity Domain of Dongshan), the other *Yuzhong Guizang* (Returning to Repose of Yuzhong). The Master did not claim this sanctuary for himself but dedicated it to his two teachers, thereby demonstrating his unwavering devotion to his lineage.\n\nBeneath the hall, earth was excavated to form a pond, broad at the edges and deep at the center. Springs were channeled to fill it, its waters neither increasing nor decreasing. Nine grades of lotus flowers bloomed there, their varieties distinct yet sharing the same fragrance. When the nine merged into one, their wonder defied description—was this not the essence of *Jade Pin*? The mountain’s veins originated from three stones above, three peaks in the middle, and three branches below, totaling nine—hence the division into nine grades, a numerological significance drawn from this.\n\nThe lotus pond derived its name from the mountain’s *Lianhua* (Lotus Flower) peak. Moreover, the Master’s lineage traced back to *Tianchi* (Heavenly Pool), and thus he named the pond after those two characters. The mountain’s orientation aligned with *qian* (northwest) and *hai* (north), corresponding to the names of heaven and earth—truly a harmonious resonance.\n\nBeside the pond stood a pavilion, and the pavilion’s structure included a terrace. Flowers and trees were planted, their fragrance perfuming the four seasons. This was a sight to inspire admiration in all who visited—how could one not delight in such a place?\n\nAs for the three hundred *mu* of land set aside for vegetarian offerings, they provided resources for incense and lamps, fulfilling the Golden Immortal’s teaching of the *unfailing mind*.\n\nExpanding upon this was Yu Zhong of Dongshan. Furthermore, at the foot of Chaoyang Mountain, he established a burial mound as a cavern for dwelling in truth—was this not also in accord with the Golden Immortal’s teaching of the Dharma of quiescent extinction? Was the Master not a disciple of the Golden Immortal?\n\nIn the third year of the Dade era, in the ji-hai year, six days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Master sent Dao Huan to present me with a map of the land and request a record, saying: “The construction of the hermitage is nearly complete. I have also purchased the neighboring land, acquiring the foundations of former worthies. Though it is now an overgrown wasteland, this too is the legacy of Tang Chengyi. I have already begun clearing and cultivating it, estimating labor and materials to build a great Buddha hall, modeled after the finest monastic halls, to pray for the eternal peace of our present emperor. Thus may the faithful of the countryside find a place of refuge. Beyond this, there will be three gates, two cloisters, a Dharma hall, living quarters, infirmaries, granaries, and storehouses—each with space reserved for future expansion. Plans are made to proceed step by step, though I know not when the work will be fully accomplished.”\n\nAlas! The Master’s words seem fitting indeed. With such vision, such aspirations, and such capacity, how could his endeavor not succeed? The only fear is that the Master might not act. I, Hong Nian, unworthy and unknown, dare to bow in respect to the Master and raise the verse of the Venerable Master Zhao Xian:\n\n*At the hundred-foot pole’s tip, one must take another step—*\n*The ten directions’ world is the whole of one’s body.*\n\nHearing this verse, the Master could not help but laugh aloud and say: “So it is, so it is! I shall accomplish it.” When it is accomplished, might you then write a continuation of this record for me? I replied: “I dare not refuse.”\n\nI, who am I? A son of the Xu family of Guangling, my name and style lost to time, my origins recorded in the *Genealogies of the Five Dynasties* under the Qi lineage. I call myself the Hermit of Biefeng Mountain. Here I gather these matters and set them down in record. The Master had the words carved upon stone, leaving them to show to later generations.\n\n*Continuation of the Inscription for the Shoutian Yuyan Daoist Sanctuary*\n\nThe meaning of the character \"Buddha\" is explained as \"not-human.\" Being \"not-human,\" it has no roof above, no shelter below, no walls in the ten directions, no gates on four sides. Taking the three-thousandfold great-thousandfold world as its vastness—who knows what transient combination this is?\n\nThe *Diamond Sutra* says: \"It is not adornment; this is called adornment.\" This is why it is called Buddha, for the Buddha-mind shines universally.\n\nThe transmission of the Sixth Patriarch’s robe and bowl followed in due order. First, he received the teaching from Zhen of Dongshan, residing at Yingtian Temple. Then, the seal was passed to Zhigong of Yuzhong, who dwelled at Yueshan Temple. The morning bell and evening drum were enough to bring ease and contentment.\n\nYet on Yupin Mountain, he built a hermitage called the Shoutian Yuyan Daoist Sanctuary. Was this merely for hauling firewood and carrying water, or to display supernatural powers? Every beam and tile, every timber and stone, were all personally handled by the Master. I say his effort was both laborious and clumsy.\n\nWhen the hermitage was completed, he asked me to record its history. To record is one thing; to add words of praise is another. Yet I could not escape the worldly habit. The Master’s mind, like Han’s horses or Xue’s cranes, was already complete in itself.\n\nThe structures included: one grand hall as the largest; two halls for the Dharma and for repose; three for the spirit assembly. There were gates and corridors, long verandas and side halls. There were granaries, storehouses, kitchens, and monastic cells. The abbot’s quarters stood square and solid, resplendent in their completeness—nine out of ten things were in place.\n\nThe earthworkers, carpenters, and stonemasons were nearly finished—seven or eight out of ten tasks done. Counting backward, it had taken four, five, or six years to complete. One can imagine the grandeur of its construction.\n\nI say the Master’s effort was still laborious and clumsy. When he commanded me to continue the record, I feared I might fail to capture the true intent behind it. Have you not seen Master Cen? He said, \"This is a man of the present age—he must hide himself away.\" Can you fathom this?\n\nThe Master sat in silent meditation. In an instant, he raised a staff and shouted: \"Though the hermitage is small, it contains the Dharma-realm. Open it wide—nothing is beyond its vastness. Draw it in—nothing is within its smallness.\"\n\nSuch words are no Dharma-case of Bodhidharma—do you grasp them?\n\nIn my eyes and ears, the sound alone pierced through. Thus I knew that the Master’s construction of this Dao-chamber was no different in scale from the Jetavana Monastery built by the Buddha. Was the Master’s purpose in erecting this Dao-chamber truly here? If not here, then it resided solely within the square inch of the heart.\n\nIts framework defies measurement by foot or yard. Its orientation eludes the compass’s needle. Its realm transcends the wild vastness of unhewn stone. Its artistry surpasses the towering steepness of the Ten Peaks, its depth beyond the abyss of the Twin Streams—no source can be fathomed. How fine, how excellent—all virtues □□.\n\nIf one can comprehend this, one sees that the entire earth is a monastic ground. One eye opened wide, the other roams freely. Eastward, no bounds; westward, no limits; upward, it props up the heavens; downward, it props up the earth—unobstructed in all four directions, eight reaches. Its radiance shines brilliantly, illuminating the ten directions, like a thousand suns casting boundless light. Otherwise, how could it be called *The Master of Universal Illumination of the Buddha-Mind*?\n\nThe Dao-chamber is built—how could it be easy? To record this is to inscribe its intent. I dare not overstep the Master’s gate. Borrowing Mount Sumeru as a peak, the ocean’s waters as ink, and a great slab of stone from Lion Rock, I inscribe and erect this stele, so that for a hundred million kalpas to come, unbroken and indestructible, it may proclaim the purpose behind *The Master of Universal Illumination of the Buddha-Mind* and the *Record of the Jade Crag Dao-Chamber of Longevity and Heaven*.\n\nThe hermitage’s history has been recorded before; thus, I compose this eulogy:\n\nMaster Cong, styled Stone Path,\nHailing from Putian, bearing his surname to the end.\nA scholar by family tradition, clad in noble robes—\nYet hills and valleys shift, literary stars fade.\nThe world’s tides surge, but he did not contend.\nUnadorned and pure, such was his true nature.\nHis studies refined, he turned to the Western Sage.\nIn a single moment of insight, not through mirrors or towers,\nHe traced the source’s flow, a lineage of endurance.\nThe Eastern Mountain’s revival—he received the touch of ordination.\nFrom fool to sage, he transmitted the true seal.\nFirst serving in the capital, praised for his talent,\nNow in Yue’s mountains, leading the multitudes.\nHe founded the Dao-chamber, divining Jade Crag.\nDragons received the Dharma, the lineage unified.\nThe dense forest gleams, the canon corrected.\nQi congeals, stone □□.\nTwin streams flow, ten peaks arrayed.\nFacing southeast, peerless in splendor.\nExcavating earth, clearing obstructions,\nMolding bricks, hewing beams steady.\nRaising walls, planting screens,\nThe hermitage complete, Chan calm and still.\nIts name fitting its purpose, inscribed upon the hall.\nExotic lotuses bloom in the pond’s long furrows.\nPavilions stand like tripods among flowers and trees.\nTwo masters’ shrines, revered with devotion.\nThe living thrive, the departed rejoice.\nYear after year, offerings made—this record was my request.\nNeighbors settled, labor and land combined.\nEarth, wood, stone—craftsmanship ever vigorous.\nOne hall, open and expansive.\nThree chambers, where Dharma-clouds repose.\nCorridors stretch, long and straight.\nJoints precise, doors aligned.\nGranaries filled, kitchens pristine.\nQuarters and rooms, all in perfect order.\nFields of two or three *qing*,\nOne stupa mound—all affairs settled.\nDisciples Long and others, following the Master’s command,\nFive or six years—work at last complete.\nOpen one eye, observe closely:\nThe Master’s dwelling—realm or no-realm?\nWithin the square inch of the heart, traces of labor vanish.\nA single point of light, ever bright,\nPermeating the Dharma-realm, towering ten thousand *ren*.\nThe Buddha came from the West—what cultivation, what realization?\nWater in the vase, stars on the scale.\nSilent, then speaking—suddenly, self-awareness.\nWhat is the meaning? Pure faith arises.\nRobes may spread wide, draped over Mount Dayu’s ridge.\nContinuing the lamp’s lineage, the flame never extinguished.\nMind is Buddha—no comparison suffices.\nCalled *Universal Illumination*, the two resonate.\nThe Master’s subtlety—let all listen closely.\nThis record’s intent—my dullness persists.\nThe eulogy lacks polish, shameful in its crudeness.\nThis stele carved, its years endure.\n\n---\n\n*Record of the Western Grove Monastery*\n\nIn the old customs of Fuzhou’s city in Min, local records speak of the \"Three Mountains.\" According to Guo Pu’s *Relocation of the State’s Land Records*: \"Before it lie the twin brows of a youth, adorned with powder and rouge.\" This refers to Wushi Mountain, Jiuxian Mountain, and Fang Mountain to the north. There are also Gaogai Mountain and Lianhua Mountain, corresponding to Fang Mountain. The name \"Three Mountains\" originates here.\n\nAmong the Three Mountains, Fang Mountain stands most prominently. South of the prefectural seat, it appears like a table—heaven’s craftsmanship, earth’s creation. How could it be merely for the prefecture’s sake?\n\nI have often said that among mountains of numinous wonder, there must emerge people of extraordinary talent, virtue, loyalty, and integrity to match them—yet I had never witnessed it. One day, wandering at the foot of Fang Mountain, after a *li*’s journey, I came upon a Buddhist monastery, coiled and towering, its plaque reading *Western Grove Chan Monastery*. The Dharma-gate vast, halls deep and grand, corridors stretching like wings, pavilions soaring like channels.\n\nTo the east, the *Heavenly Meal Fragrant Accumulation Kitchen*; to the west, the *Cloud Assembly Chan Banquet Hall*. As for the *Arhat Shrine*, *Jeweled Flower Hall*, and *Abbot’s Quarters*—none lacked splendor. Granaries and storied chambers left no space unfilled. Timber, stone, rafters, tiles—whitewashed walls all renewed. Bells, fish-shaped wooden drums—every implement in place.\n\nAs for the pond’s excavation, water channeled to cultivate pure minds—unstained, unsoiled, this is called adornment. The azure lotus, the golden Buddha—rays of white light illuminate the ten directions, pervading the three thousand great thousand worlds.\n\nI burned incense, pressed palms together—like ascending to heaven. The four great elements, the five aggregates—truly, nothing exists. I sighed: this is how those who transcend the world achieve merit and renown.\n\nAfter a moment, the abbot emerged, draped in his robe, sleeves holding his sitting mat, and greeted me.\n\nI beheld the man—his bearing open and forthright, free of self-and-other distinctions. Bowing, I asked: “Master, were you the founder of this mountain temple?” He invited me to sit, brewed tea in welcome, and spoke unhurriedly: “The temple’s founding master was the patriarch of the Tang’s Guangming era. A century later, Chan Master Jingde of the Song expanded it into a proper sanctuary. Counting the years to now, more than three hundred springs and autumns have passed. In the Xianchun year of *wuchen*, this old monk came from Longjiang and dwelt on the mountain for a full decade. Just then, war broke out, reducing all to ruins and overgrown wilderness—passersby could only sigh. Without consulting others or seeking aid, I emptied my own robes and alms-bowl, single-handedly shouldering the task. Hoarding what little surplus I had, treating it as personal wealth, I hired laborers and artisans upon the old site. Through years of toil and service, I at last achieved this restoration. I added fields to the holdings, bringing greater benefit than before, merely to sustain the morning incense and evening lamps for the assembly. Above, I pray for the sovereign’s longevity; below, I offer the villagers a refuge within the Buddha’s Dharma. Thus may I face without shame the two founding masters, Guangming and Jingde.\n\nWithin the abbot’s quarters, I built a hall and erected a pagoda, arraying the ocean-wide assembly of past generations to left and right. Above, I sculpted the Three Buddhas; below, I designated a single niche as the *spirit chamber*, where the true returns to its source—this fulfills this old monk’s vow. Now I wish to quarry mountain stone and inscribe the years, that future eyes may know the origins of this place. Having long heard of your true goodness, I wished to learn of the causes and conditions of the *Empty School’s* teachings—how fitting! With Mount Sumeru as my brush and the sea as ink, I could compose but a few lines, no different from speech. As you offer skillful means, I dare not refuse.”\n\nThus I replied: “Excellent! Excellent! The master’s name is Zheng Rong. His ancestors hailed from the old county of Changle, bearing the surname Xie. Though his family had long been scholars, he was one of those rare, loyal, and virtuous men who could forsake the world and yet attain merit and renown.”\n\nHaving recorded this, I let out a long whistle and stepped outside—no one knew where I had gone. The master said: “How spirit-like!”\n\nOn the day preceding the Chrysanthemum Festival of the first year of the Yuanzhen era, this was recorded by Xu Ruzi, former Prefect of Guangling, of Donghai.\n\n*End of Volume Two of Xu’s Immortal Brush*\n*Volume Three of Xu’s Immortal Brush begins*\n\n**Ode to Turtle Peak**\n\nHow towering! How lofty!—the soaring majesty of Turtle Peak!\nAccording to the *Diagrams of Symbols* in the *Huainanzi*, we know its ancestral roots lie in Kunlun;\nExamining the *Green Satchel Classic* of Master Red Pine, we know its branches spread from Mount Yuling.\n\nFrom the south it comes, as if the myriad foreign lands had converged, turning northward to pay homage.\nIt emulates the reverence of Mount Song in offering blessings to the sacred—its bearing refined, its form upright.\nLike an overturned golden bowl, like a vast cauldron upturned.\nLike an immortal donning ceremonial robes, like a jade maiden unveiling her mirror.\nLike a warrior’s helmeted reflection, like a nobleman’s scepter held in hand.\n\nBefore it, Square Mountain bows as its footrest;\nBehind it, Mount Pu stands as its screen.\nDeer Mountain flanks it to the left, while Zhihe Mountain supports it to the right.\nAll stand in perfect order—tall, erect, and steadfast.\nEven the Nine Flowers of Chi or the Yellow Mountains of She could not compare to this peak’s grandeur;\nThe peaks of Chengdu or the cliffs of Yandang could not rival its fame.\nThe mountains of Kuaiji in Wu, the marshes of Yunmeng in Chu, Luofu in Hui, or Wuling in Lang—none could capture its form, nor dare describe it.\n\nI measure it with my tablet held horizontally—its expanse spans no less than two or three hundred *li*.\nI gauge its height with a marker—it rises no less than four or five thousand *zhang*.\nA mere hand’s breadth from heaven, it looms before the gazer’s eyes.\nClimbing with a flask at one’s waist and a rope in hand, one ascends directly.\nEach step brings one closer to the Purple Tenuity’s court; with a raised hand, one might scoop the waves of the Silver River.\nHow small are men and things! The vast earth lies before my eyes, as if displayed on my palm.\n\nHad General Meng lived here, he would surely have feared his cap falling;\nHad Governor Xie known of it, he would have longed to lace his sandals.\nYet those men are gone—who now appreciates this sight?\n\nAs for its undulating forms—high and low, convex and concave, uneven yet ordered—layer upon layer, like fields and ridges.\nAt dawn, the mist recedes, and the sun’s crow rises in the east;\nAt dusk, the rosy clouds scatter, and the white hare’s moon appears in the west.\nIt draws in the pure radiance—how bright!\nIt gathers the lush shadows—how verdant!\n\nWhen spring winds stir, flowers and herbs bloom in fragrance;\nWhen summer clouds gather, the forests cast deep shade.\nWhen autumn dew dries, the mountain mists fade;\nWhen winter frost falls, the grasses and trees wither.\nSuch are the rare moments of beauty, the scenes poets and scholars gaze upon in admiration.\n\nHere, tigers and wolves, foxes and hares dwell in dens and burrows;\nBirds and pheasants nest in roosts and bowers.\nSome cry, some clamor, some howl, some roar.\nThe hunter casts his sky-spanning net, laying traps across the wilds.\nWith a summer bow in his right hand and a black-elk arrow in his left,\nHe captures or releases, steams or roasts—offering for my rites, filling my kitchen.\n\nIts trees include pine, cypress, camphor, ju, chinaberry, paulownia, nanmu, *ning*, maple, fir, *luo*, beech, sandalwood, locust, catalpa, *ke*, *cha*, banyan, *□*, *zheng*, *cong*, *zhen*, wolfberry, *guang*, *□*, *si*, *□*—\nThe small may be used for shop signs, wedges, door pivots, or gates;\nThe large may serve as beams, rafters, ridgepoles, or eaves—so vast their uses, one may choose as needed.\n\nThere are also red plantains, white ramie, fine kudzu, green hemp, wild mulberry, wild silkworm oak, pagoda tree blossoms, indigo, *di* seeds, *nou* bark, true red, purple *□*—all to adorn the body.\nLychee, longan, *lü* oranges, pomelos, crabapples, yellow bullets, red cherries, white crabapples, *jia* loquats, *lu* cherries, bayberries, and black *bei*—all to delight the palate.\n\nAs for its herbs: elsholtzia, achyranthes, Solomon’s seal, yams, *jiaoteng*, *mawu*, rehmannia, *guzi*, mint, wormwood, perilla, nutgrass, evodia, chrysanthemum, hyacinth beans, vetiver, bitter *lou*, fennel, mugwort, *sui* *□*, phellodendron, *mubie*, poppy, goat’s milk—\nSome grow as purple bamboo shoots of Guzhu, others as Job’s tears of Jiaozhou—nothing is lacking, though I cannot record them all.\n\nHow different from the past! I sigh that the months and years have fled.\nThus, with a single note of the flute, I join the cowherds in returning home.\n\nAmidst the decayed chessboard of the *Burnt Axe*, one may learn from the woodcutter to steal a moment’s leisure. Where rocks stand jagged, they form the chambers of Daoist adepts; where grasses grow thick and wild, they become the hermit’s thatched hut. Here is a seat for meditation, there a terrace for ascending transcendence. Once the auspicious glow of heavenly lanterns appeared; once the alchemical cinnabar of the immortal’s crucible lingered. The echoes of stone drums still resound, the scars of sword-stones remain etched. Narrow and perilous paths are called the *Gates of Drawn Battle*; broad and level expanses serve as *Bays for Resting Horses*. These are not empty words—how could I speak falsely of ancient traces? Yet why this sigh of emotion? Surely they are still there to behold.\n\nLofty, lofty—cliffs too sheer to scale. Deep, deep—pools without bottom. Each stands in its depth or shallowness, dividing into two or three. Orchids and angelicas share fragrance, rich and dense; wisteria and creepers intertwine in emerald tangle. Springs gush forth in ceaseless flow, their murmuring currents soft and clear. A single waterfall hangs from cliffs ten thousand feet high—white as silk, blue as indigo. When it scatters, its droplets are round as pearls; when it surges, its depths are vast as a basin. No golden blade could so easily cut it, no jade ruler could truly measure it.\n\nAt times, a divine dragon transforms—now dim, now bright. It soars, it dives; it emerges, it vanishes. Now it lashes forth as thunder and lightning, now it rears as *□* and *□*. Now rain pours down in torrents, now clouds rise in gentle swells. Its shrine is grandly enfeoffed, and the people never grow weary of reverence.\n\nWhen chaos first parted and the earliest ages began, who shaped this place? Adorning the earth with beauty, it lay beyond the Qin capital, outside the Han maps. Ruling over Nanyue, only King Wuzhu resisted the topknots and barbaric customs. Guarding this corner of the world, he concealed his light and hid his tracks—who dared praise him, who dared blame?\n\nFrom the *Zhenguan* era of Tang, it was named an *Upper Capital*. Its reputation was grand, its bearing majestic. Like a slope rising abruptly amid miles of plain, it gathers verdant hues and spreads like a market, embracing the tidal roar like a basin. Its mound is called *Passing the Rammed Earth*; its ridge is named *Incense Burner*. Behold the whiteness of its waters, the blackness of its stones. The front ocean serves as its elbow and armpit; the rich mountains as its toes and instep. Here, upon this land, these people till their fields and build their homes.\n\nYet how the hills have shifted and valleys changed, how times alter and affairs diverge! In the Five Dynasties’ chaos, ten clans drove forward together. Who could have foreseen the Wang family, calling themselves the humble and foolish? Within, they drowned in excess; without, they imposed heavy levies. Palaces knew no bounds; hunting and pleasure were their sole delight. No fixed seasons, no rest from toil. Birds took flight in alarm, beasts fled in terror—life nearly ceased. Mountains were left barren, forests stripped—all turned to desolate mounds.\n\nWas it not the Su clan’s repeated rise that withered the Eyebrow Mountain? As the saying goes, the matter is no lie. From *Jianlong* to *Xiangfu*, the court’s civil rule flourished; village schools and classical learning thrived. In time, great scholars and renowned officials emerged, aiding and promoting one another without hesitation. This place led all prefectures, breaking through the path to office. Crimson and purple adorned their backs; carriages and horses filled their gates.\n\nOnce, this peak’s numen shone through the excellence of things. Now, this peak’s essence resides in the store of men. Alas! North and south, east and west—time flows like the shuttle, yet this peak does not age. Entrusted with divinity, it was granted noble rank. Its honors increased, its wisdom never faltered, guiding people toward goodness. Though the literary spirit has not perished, the Dao hides in secrecy, subtle and obscure. I know my account may seem strange, fearing it borders on the dubious. I feel great shame before Cao Zhi’s grand principles, deep regret before Zuo Si’s decade of toil. Let this be my *Capture of the Unicorn* brush—lest it invite the scorn of being fit only to cover a wine jar.\n\n*Ode to the Lingji Palace*\n\nDragons carve tortoises, turtles peddle books—how strange and uncanny! In the *Taiyuan* era of the *Jiao* dynasty, silence was not the way; I sought answers in the earliest images. Fu Xi and Nü Wa questioned the cause, yet remained dim and unenlightened. Only when the dark crow’s revelation came did they suddenly create and return to it. In profound obscurity, the craft of Chui aligned the compass—patterns emerged, intent was set. This was no mere omen from banquet mats or wine vessels; that numinous breath remained unknowable.\n\nI observe the reclusive one, faint and indistinct, guarding the profound mystery in silence. Lightning flashes and vanishes in an instant—how fleeting! To fathom the universe is to reach its limits—who can foresee its end? Like the earth itself, it stretches without bound. Thus the Five Emperors stand tall, the Three Sovereigns unfold in succession. Divine parks have their regulations, sacred halls their standards. Treading the present with measured steps, who now strays or falters?\n\nThe nine heavens stretch vast and distant—where to place, where to attach? Why descend so sharply to dwell upon Bie Peak? Ascending winding paths to the splendid altar, I arrive at dawn’s first light. Heaven gazes down from azure heights; earth is piled into hills and mountains. Clouds twist and waves writhe—its foundations coil and twist, beginning in Dongping. Tracing back to the Tang’s sudden *□*, its roots split the tripod to form peaks. Towering, like a docile camel’s team; lofty, like a crimson steed and azure dragon.\n\nBeholding the winding streams of lotus blossoms, I draw in pure numen and feel my heart refreshed. The sacred mountain’s *□* stands majestic, draped in lush, verdant qi. The nine wards and nine paths spread in disarray, like wells and houses linked in rows. Morning tides, evening ebbs—Dao flows vast and surging. Truly, mountains and rivers, earth spirits and ghosts, the Queen Mother nurtures the numinous.\n\nIn the *Zhenghe* era, officials were consulted to build it. Its solemn uprightness was grand; earth, wood, and stonework stood firm. Yet the columns of whetstone gleam, the carved jade pillars rise sheer. Flying eaves soar, tiered roofs ascend. Layered beams and interlocking brackets spread like wings, rich and intricate. Double rafters and stacked arches rise ever higher, tier upon tier.\n\nThe vermilion gates of layered pavilions unfold grandly, their grandeur rivaling the stone drums of Qiyang. The low walls and embankments stand in splendid ruggedness, resplendent in red and blue. Secret chambers and secluded halls loom jagged and deep, stretching into the boundless haze. The eastern corridors and western wings rise in towering succession, embracing the land’s contours in mutual embrace.\n\nHere too are screens of kingfisher feathers and pearls, silken nets of peacock plumes in ordered ranks, and golden geese unfurled. Embroidered hems are stitched, woven mats spread beneath. They receive the sacred talismans of Mount Gou, moved by the golden vines of Manlu. Yet these are not enough to evoke antiquity—interspersed with glistening glass, they weave a tapestry of splendor.\n\nVermilion lingzhi clouds surge in swirling mists; auspicious incense from Boshan censers billows thick and fragrant. The wind sings through jade-railed cedar and pine; the moon hangs upon the patterned windows of locust and cassia. Some enclose earth to pool springs, their murmuring waters alive with rippling currents. Carp and mandarin fish dart through clear eddies, their tails flashing. The passage of accumulated blessings opens vast, gathering the great thousand worlds into a single grain.\n\nThe Dragon’s Head Peak soars to towering heights, its lofty summits circling the numinous pagoda. Outer structures link in endless succession, front and rear merging seamlessly. Forms vary, sights diverge—none can be fully described. Even the steps ascend in graded ranks; the guards’ formations follow strict commands. To the left, voices hush; to the right, silence reigns. The demons and specters stand firm, their shoulders laden with shields and spears. Harshly they bar the way, permitting no breath of disobedience. The reckless halt, hands bound, awaiting orders.\n\nOn the eve of rituals, vigil is kept with utmost care. Heads lift and bow in measured rhythm, advancing and retreating in turn. Faces are composed, expressions solemn. Eyes hold sincerity; reverence is etched in every gesture. The painted figures bristle with ferocity, their fiery auras blazing fiercely—these are the stalwart warriors. Vigilant and imposing, they stand like jade-clad soldiers. Tiger-headed, swallow-chinned, their strategies drawn from dragon’s arts and leopard’s cunning. Bows and arrows arrayed, banners and pennants raised, they wield halberds and brandish axes. Their movements leave no trace, their schemes hidden in the unfathomable. Like the ramparts of a willow camp, they display the order of a well-guarded encampment.\n\nThus they sever ties with factions, distance themselves from distant lands. From remote peaks and across the seas, tribute flows in ceaseless streams. Behold this hall—here guests and envoys find respite. Let it be recorded as a royal assembly, celebrating the Great Peace of this day.\n\nWith reverence, we extol the Emperor: may his reign span ten thousand years, a father and mother to all. Under heaven, all is the sovereign’s domain. He refines culture and stills warfare. Loyalty is his armor, trust his helmet; ritual his shield, righteousness his bulwark. He gathers poets in literary societies, hunts for talent in the forests of words. He roams the ink fields, dispatches envoys to the realm of brush and silk, drawing the multitudes to lofty brilliance. He summons auspicious clouds, □ the white elders. The Eastern Wall shines radiant, a dazzling spectacle to behold.\n\nHow grand! The Lingyan Pavilion, where the finest figures gather, all girded in gold and robed in purple. Like the Western Liang’s lion-dancing Hu, or the acrobats of Xunzhuang, they perform with dazzling agility. Veils swirl, movements blur—mastering the arcane arts of Zanggan, the melodies of the Pear Garden rise in resonant song. Here are the beauties of Chu, the charms of Wu, the maidens of Qin, the sisters of Wei. Powdered faces, dark brows, adorned in silks and brocades, adorned with gold and pearls. They feast on fine delicacies, sated with meat from the imperial cauldrons. Eight treasures flow in abundance, apportioned from the imperial kitchens. The assembled concubines vie in splendor—what path of indulgence is beyond reach? Yet the Emperor’s heart remains discerning, allowing no slack in skill, no laxity in pleasure for the eyes and ears.\n\nThe gates of heaven stand wide, unbarred, with no steps to ascend. The glory of his name and virtue rivals the sun and moon. Even a weight of ten thousand jun would not suffice to measure his worth. Yet how does he govern with effortless ease, ever vigilant as if in fear? He cherishes kin and fosters harmony, reciting the verses of *Famu*. The Lord of Lu feasts in joy, offering the hymns of the *Biyong*. The Hall of Names bears woven characters as its rule. Subtly it conveys its meaning, perhaps nearly enough to warn the multitude of cares.\n\nThe *Yu* dynasty’s omens of loss and gain were once divined—let them serve as a lesson. The literary legacy remains unlost, like Yan and Kong of old. The calligraphy of Huiping and seal scripts of Zhuanxu may be inscribed on the halls of the Xuanyuan. Breathing like bears, still as turtles—observing their techniques, even the later masters Huang, Ren, Xu, and Dong pale in comparison. Who among men could rival this? Only he may be proclaimed and enfeoffed, receiving heaven’s favor.\n\nAgain, the thunder gods are summoned to clear the path with rumbling cries; the rain masters are commanded to wash away the dust. Feilian drives the winds with fierce shouts. Their voices ring out, the Divine Mother hurls her might. The great procession begins, chariots drawn by dragons. Cloud banners flutter, eight simurghs and five phoenixes swirl in abundance. They converge in welcome, ascending on pure qi. The journey presses on, passing through the gates of heaven to reach the Purple Court. There is no pause in coming or going—below, inverted reflections; above, radiant light. A hundred flavors, fine wines offered with fragrant orchids. Though the halls of Du Heng stand serene, how can peace be assured forever? May your sacrifices endure for ten thousand ages.\n\n*Wenxing Hermitage Rhapsody*\nOne day, a gentleman of refined tastes approached me, incense in sleeve, and said: \"In our homeland, palaces and temples each have their steles, and the Hall of Accumulated Blessings has its record. The pagoda of Wenxing Hermitage, as a Daoist sanctuary, cannot be dismissed as insignificant—why not compose a few words for it?\"\n\nI do not dare to lag behind, but as the sanctuary nears ruin, no one has yet emerged to restore it to its former state. Thus, I feel shame. Now, prompted by your inquiry, I gather these details to encourage those with affinity.\n\nThus, I compose this rhapsody:\n\nTurtle Peak rises ten thousand fathoms high, a mere grasp from heaven. Winding its way here, who knows how many rises and falls it has known? Suddenly, it unfurls into three verdant peaks—here stand your hut, your home. Bowing to the encircling ridges in homage, it gazes west and lingers in hesitation.\n\nNo donkey’s hooves could tread this ground—only the dragon and elephant make their dens here. Enshrined within is the Tathāgata’s true relic, each granule gleaming like golden peaches inlaid with jade. Wrapped in felt, bundled in mats, borne by camel from the Western Regions, it was set as the pagoda’s heart. Hewn from the mountain’s stone with water-polished edges, its seven-tiered bones ascend in towering splendor.\n\nA thousand Buddhas manifest in its form, carved with wind-driven chisels and divine precision. A sacred flame burns cold and blue, illuminating the Dipper and Ox stars above. Beheld by humans, devas, ghosts, and spirits, all rejoice in my resolve—though some may fear its fulfillment. Morning and evening, devotees bow in reverence, their devotion deepening at the dark of the moon, its waxing, its waning, and its return.\n\nThis was the former abbot’s hermitage, where the monk Xiū composed his gāthās. A descendant of Bi Gan named Huaixian, he was the village’s pillar of generosity. With the wooden fish’s startling knock, his voice echoed through the night like a mountain crane’s call. His merit perfected in the Hall of Many Fragrances—one bowl, one spoon.\n\nThe stele inscription from the Yuánfú era still marks the years, though words cannot fully capture its tale. Here, I merely sketch its broad strokes. The name *Pure Wisdom* once resounded in antiquity, speaking of the Western Paradise’s bliss. *Wenxing* shines in the present, bearing the intent of the scholar-gentleman.\n\nSome dedicate halls to Confucius, aspiring to learning; others worship the Primal Sovereign, seeking official rank. The Hall of Vast Kindness stands here, the Pavilion of Pure Integrity beside it. To the right, they pay homage to the Dark Heaven; to the left, they gaze upon the Eastern Peak. They invite the guiding masters of Sukhāvatī, seated upon blue lotuses in radiant splendor.\n\nA thousand wheels of wisdom’s power manifest in their forms, unadorned by leaden cosmetics yet draped in jeweled garlands. Like Yuanying’s dazzling white robes, some display their simplicity; like Mingjue’s golden railing’s luster, others proclaim their elegance. Through medicine, they heal and revive the people, needing no ginseng or cassia. Through filial piety, they elevate themselves, transforming the world’s shallow wickedness.\n\nThe hall is named *Assembly of Attainment*, its numinous presence profound. A thousand gates spread like five phoenixes in flight, eaves carved high and intricate. Chambers and storerooms stand in order, kitchens and baths rebuilt anew. Zēng Yóu’s brushwork adorns the halls with murals, though some are marred by time’s soot and whitewash.\n\nWith all vessels prepared, none remain steadfast to exert their strength. Yet each endeavor reaches completion—not through a single morning or evening’s work. Restored in the Xuānhé era by Zhang, Wu, and Guo, it was later expanded by Xu, Zhou, and others. From Yuánfú to Jǐngyán, renovations and renewals have numbered many.\n\nPraise their loyalty and diligence, which shall plant roots for eons as countless as river sands. How dare I abandon my heart and let it fall to ruin, bowing and rising without shame? Yet the Torch Dragon’s light does not endure forever; the incense’s fragrance fades into obscurity. The musk’s embers have long since died—who can fan them back to life? The great edifice teeters on collapse—who can prop it with a single timber?\n\nMourning the ancients who vanished like the wind, with whom can I consult? Those yet to come, I shall not hear. Alone, I sigh in sorrow, my cap askew, muttering: *What is this?*\n\nMountains and valleys shift and intertwine—what era’s path is this? Why scurry like ants on a snail’s horn? Why abandon the root to chase the branch? Why lament aging too soon, shrinking in shame? Why fret in ignorance? Why, like a stolen carriage, meet no Bole to recognize its worth? Why, though skilled in painting, fail to reach the frontier’s craftsmen and remain a mere ink-stained scholar? Why do the ancients leave traces, yet this path is blocked? Why speak of gains without substance? When will the neglected repairs be addressed?\n\nFrom *Self-Defense of My Writing*\nWhat I have composed, others deem impractical and absurd.\n\nToday’s absurdities may become tomorrow’s enfeoffments and inherited titles. To regard these as proofs of merit and steps to advancement—such is the ignorance of men like you. In former times, works like the *Soushen Ji*, *Shenyi Zhi*, *Youguai Ji*, *Shanhaijing*, and *Youming Lu* were all dismissed as absurd. Yet today, who reads them without a sigh of admiration? Who would say otherwise?\n\nI have read the words of the Sage: *\"The Master did not speak of prodigies, force, disorder, or spirits.\"* Yet in the *Capture of the Lin* and the *Oaths of Alliance*, omens and portents appear repeatedly, recorded without omission. Some criticize these passages, attributing them to the mouths of Gongyang, Zuoshi, and Guliang. But the one who first shaped such accounts cannot evade responsibility—hence the saying: *\"Those who understand me do so through the* Spring and Autumn Annals; *those who condemn me do so through the* Spring and Autumn Annals.\"* How profound is the difficulty of discerning true talent!\n\nLiterature is the public instrument of the world; if it is not in error, what need is there for debate? My own works—I know not whether they are right or wrong. I ask only that they be examined. When Duan Wenchang composed the *Stele of Pingcai*, Prefect Chen Xiang removed it, valuing only the prose of Han Changli. Though Changli is revered by later generations, how could he not know what Su the Academician meant when he said: *\"I do not know if the world contains verses like Duan Wenchang’s—how does he compare to Duan Wenchang?\"* My own works, though lacking Duan Wenchang’s talent, may be preserved; they must not be discarded. If they are cast aside, even if this record remains, who will speak for it?\n\nI do not seek to preserve these writings to boast before the present age, dazzle future generations, or deceive the ears of the multitude. Rather, when later men attend to the temple rites, reading my record and witnessing my conduct, they will not deceive themselves in the darkness but feel reverence for the spirits arise naturally within them. Since the record is already written, it must be engraved and transcribed—only the right person can be entrusted with this task. Thus, I dare to appeal to your judgment, certain that you will have your reasons.\n\nDongpo once said: *\"In my life, I have never composed eulogies, epitaphs, or tomb steles for others.\"* Yet when he wrote the biographies of Minister Sima Wen and Duke Fu Han, he declared: *\"I dared not firmly refuse, though it was not my true inclination.\"* If you undertake this stele, is it not to assume the role Dongpo claimed for himself?\n\nNevertheless, Cai Yong said to Lu Zhi: *\"I have written many steles and records, all with some regret—only the* Stele for Guo Youdao *leaves me without shame.\"* I dare make this plea with the same conviction.\n\n*A Treatise to Silence Slander*\n\nSince assuming my sacred office in the Dao, after universally delivering all beings, I have never once engaged in worldly intercourse. Even when I have uttered a few words or penned a single character, they have been nothing but inducements toward goodness. Yet if the recipient’s essence is not pure enough to resonate, no sign or omen will respond. As for floods, droughts, epidemics, or unforeseen calamities—these are all due to my own lack of virtue. I can only tremble in fear, reflect deeply, and exhaust every means of averting and dispelling them.\n\nImpartial and selfless, I answer doubts as swiftly as an echo. Yet today’s scribes and chroniclers cannot be trusted, for among them lurk those who fabricate illusions—crafty deceivers who borrow the guises of fox spirits and rat demons. They peer through doors, lurk in empty chambers, and embellish their tales, casting lines to hook the gullible and boast of their exploits. How can they claim that men may be deceived, yet the gods deceived as well? As the saying goes: *\"One may be fooled, but not utterly deluded.\"* Fish eyes and true pearls—genuine and counterfeit are plain to see. Let the discerning not be led astray, lest they bring shame upon the divine.\n\nThus, I set down these words to silence slander:\n\n*The gods inquire in mystery, dwelling in the unseen.*\n*How then do brushstrokes transform, their numen sharp and bright?*\n*Strung like pearls, inlaid with jade, they gleam like sun and stars.*\n*Ban and Zhang’s steeds were unmatched, their worth beyond compare.*\n*The life-saving scriptures of Han Kang endure like flowing streams.*\n*Guo Jingchun’s geomancy charts the hidden paths of yin and yang.*\n*Followers throng with provisions, their carriages blocking the gates.*\n*Virtue engraved in human hearts shall last ten thousand years.*\n\nYet now it is otherwise: the divine conceals itself in heaven.\nAppearing without, vanishing within—such is called immortality.\nVague and indistinct, silent and wordless.\nWho could have foreseen that night-rats would borrow the fox’s cry,\nTwisting truth into confusion, stirring men’s indignation?\nSeeking the gods’ favor, they prepare offerings, both male and female.\nWhose fault is this? The wretched knave, severed and cast aside—\n*\"One may be deceived, but not utterly deluded.\"*\nDare they mock me? Let their sins accumulate until their bodies perish,\nPunished by men and cursed by ghosts.\n\nYou scholars in your caps, shaped like men yet not men—\nDo you think the gods, ever-changing, are deaf to your schemes?\nOnce revered, now you scramble for profit.\nOnce obscure, now your temple rites are complete.\nSelf-promoting, self-hawking—only the gods are shamed.\nI lay down my brush and sing, a song long familiar to men’s ears:\n\n*I sing to warn you: do not follow deceit.*\n*This text is written to silence slander.*\n\n*Not a divine decree, but a verse like Nüwa’s severing the turtle’s legs—*\n*When primordial chaos first parted from Mount Song and Tai.*\n*The towering peaks of Heng and Hua—*\n*Their gods are called Di and Zhi.*\n*Shun piled wood for sacrifice, Yu made his inspections;*\n*Qin performed the feng rites, Han offered their prayers.*\n*Yet the transmission of the rightful succession remains unproven—*\n*Who claims it was a water dragon or a wooden kui?*\n\n*My origins in this world began in Xiaopi.*\n*My spirit conceived at Caishi, nurtured by the marvels of Biefeng.*\n*Alas, in the fleeting moment of soul’s destruction and spirit’s dissolution,*\n*I was summoned from the dark void to gallop through the unseen.*\n*Mourning the desolation of the sacred temple,*\n*I gaze at the abandoned halls, their grandeur faded.*\n*I long to cast off my cap and tear my robes,*\n*To see the treacherous paths of the world.*\n*The great edifice is collapsing, yet none tend to it—*\n*I fear a single timber cannot prop it up.*\n*In the year of* zhaoyang *and* dahuangluo*,*\n*I sharpen my wits by Luochi.*\n*Wielding the writing brush as my voice,*\n*I invert truth to expose beauty and ugliness.*\n*Some slander with cunning, clamoring loudly,*\n*Claiming I deceive with flattery.*\n*Flourishing their tongues like petals and leaves,*\n*They prattle on like Qin’s courtiers.*\n*You, silent and composed, why not stand firm in integrity?*\n*Small as a gourd ladle or a midge,*\n*How can you fathom the depths with a well’s narrow gaze?*\n*Your bellies swollen with parasites,*\n*You are no match for the wine-skin’s capacity.*\n*The sprouts of* nie *valleys perish by dawn—*\n*What use are the short-lived fox’s shadow-watching schemes?*\n*Heaven and earth stretch boundless, without end;*\n*Life and death surge vast—who can comprehend them?*\n*Ruan Zhan’s debates on right and wrong—*\n*His bones now crumble to dust.*\n*If you say my words lack proof,*\n*Then take the sorcerer’s new wheat as your omen.*\n*It is said: Heaven’s Way blesses the good and punishes the wicked,*\n*As surely as a shadow follows its form.*\n*Those who scheme and feign madness,*\n*Waver like foxes, full of doubt.*\n*Revere the gods as if they stand beside you—*\n*I remain silent. What more can I say?*\n\n*Do Not Destroy the Stele*\nTo destroy the stele is to say it must not be destroyed.\nThe *ci* are the words that voice its transgressions.\nThese words say:\n\n*How extreme the deceit of the age has become—*\n*Cunning as rats, clever as macaques.*\n*With gardenia faces and waxen tongues,*\n*You mimic the whispers of your ilk.*\n*Your clever paintings strive to surpass dogs and horses,*\n*Yet only ghosts and demons occupy your designs.*\n*You avoid the great paths to tread the fish and waterfowl’s way,*\n*Yet know well the dangers of the road.*\n*The ranks of the dark and numinous are dense—*\n*They are not like trees, devoid of spirit.*\n*Pity the firefly chasing the dark,*\n*Calling the long night endless.*\n*You beast-faced, speaking like men—*\n*Are you not mere apes?*\n*Can pythons truly swallow deer?*\n*They only twist and shed their scales.*\n*You cultivate bravery by shooting at ramie,*\n*Yet Yi was ultimately trapped in his own body.*\n*Defiling wealth, you suffer calamity—*\n*Chong’s greed surpassed even his love for wife and child.*\n*When evil accumulates, it harms the full,*\n*Yet you cover it with praise and resent the record.*\n*You carve your clan’s precious stone,*\n*Listening to the wails of your ancestors.*\n*The sun sets in a haze of yellow,*\n*Suddenly scorching the parched east.*\n*Behold the net of heaven, its cords spread wide—*\n*Who can escape its three-sided snare?*\n*Blowing on cold ashes to make soup,*\n*You cling to the heat, refusing to wake.*\n*No model to follow, you trace the steps of Han’s fools.*\n*Stalking the tripod’s power in secret,*\n*Why prattle on with your mouths?*\n*Before the drum is buried, its sound is scorched by the sun.*\n*Flames blaze—why heed women’s slander?*\n*The loyal hearts of great generals burn bright—*\n*Why repent of others’ schemes?*\n*The public’s judgment has its merits and flaws—*\n*It is not bias that favors Han.*\n*Moved by the wheel’s hub, I reflect—*\n*Knowing the Creator’s preferences.*\n\n*(End of translation)*\n\nThe canonical punishments remain complete—\netched for ten thousand generations, never to be erased.\nYet the benighted, knowing nothing,\nindulge in wanton malice and stubborn folly.\nThey burn the transmitted classics to drown the scriptures—\nof Shao and Lu, which shall endure?\nThe white-stone ox cannot bear its trembling slaughter—\nah, what grievous wrong!\nSome are swayed by fortune’s shifts,\ndying at the gate in vain.\nSome tread divergent paths in darkness,\nyet face reckoning in warmth.\nIs this age so unlike the past?\nDeeds bear no karmic fruit.\nOr do water and fire rail falsely?\nI dare not whisper even to the cautious tortoise.\nThe black snail is no stranger to the distant Yao—\nvirtue flows unseen between them.\nThus Heaven blesses the good and curses the licentious,\nenforcing the Dao’s decree.\nEven when hurling a rat, one fears breaking the vessel—\nwhy do they fail to ponder this?\nTo cover all eyes with a single finger—\nwho could thus deceive the heavens?\nHeaven’s rafters are vast—\nupon whom shall blame fall?\nDo not deface the stele—\nwhat excuse could I offer?\n\nAlas! Such are these matters.\n\n*End of Scroll Three of Xu Xian’s Literary Flourishes*\n*Scroll Four of Xu Xian’s Literary Flourishes*\n*Ode to the Joyful Rain*\n\nAt the Sacred Rain-Praying Ritual of the Venerable Lingji Temple,\nwe reverently invoked the Enlightened Arhat Bodhisattva,\nFounder of Deer Park,\nwho struck his staff upon the holy waters,\noffering devotion—\nand swiftly received divine response.\nIn solemn record of this event,\nI compose this *Ode to the Joyful Rain*,\ninscribing it upon the Spring Pavilion,\nto be passed down for generations,\nawakening the resolve of those who seek refuge.\n\nThus have I heard.\nThe Master spoke in verse:\nWhile all strain their eyes toward clouds and rainbows,\nI, at this very hour, bring down the blessings of rain.\nMy vow extends boundlessly—\nsuch is the heart of compassion, benefiting all beings.\nWhy point to wide-open eyes,\nonly to clutch at the Buddha’s feet in desperate times?\nHow could one fail to recall the fields of Mulberry Forest,\nwhere prayers were offered to mountains and rivers?\nDo mountains and rivers possess spirits?\nWhen drought grows dire,\nevery stream and peak is cleansed,\nno deity left uninvoked—\nyet some still ask, *\"What use is worshipping spirits?\"*\nSpirits are not spirits in themselves;\nrather, the human heart, moved by sincerity, summons them.\nThe Master’s numinous power\nderives from the Tathāgata’s divine might.\nHis precepts, virtue, and merit\nare likewise beyond comprehension.\nThe villagers’ faith in him\nhas stood unshaken for ages.\nOver five hundred years,\nhow many have been sheltered by his grace?\n\nSince last autumn through winter, and now into the third month of spring, not a single drop of rain has fallen, and no seeds have been sown in the earth. Truly, this is a time of dire peril and urgent crisis—who would dare to slaughter geese and soften their blood in sacrifice? To place trust in snake-oil healers would only invite ridicule from those of discernment. Yet it was said: we had heard that within the Chan Master’s sleeve, indolent dragons could be summoned, and with a whip’s command, made to obey. Thus, we came to pay homage and beseech our Master. Following his chariot, rain fell on the day after the *renyin* day, a gentle drizzle spreading in all directions. By the *bingwu* day, the rains had come in full. Young and old alike leapt for joy, their delight mingling in celebration. They declared: *\"The Perfected One has opened the mountain rains!\"* And so, they offered incense and chanted praises.\n\n**Record of the Eastern Well’s Restoration**\nThe Eastern Well’s origins are recorded in stone inscriptions, which state: *\"In the eighth year of the Xining reign, the year *yimao*, on the thirteenth day of the intercalary eighth month, *yisi*,\"*—two hundred and twenty-four years have passed since then. Before the Xining era, when the well’s bricks were first laid, its masonry and railings still stood, bearing the inscription: *\"Zhang Jue donates the Eastern Well’s railing\"* in six characters. Jue was a man of virtuous renown during the Five Dynasties period. By reckoning, this was the eighth year of the Tianfu reign of the Later Jin, the first year of Tiande in Min—spanning, in total, three hundred and sixty-seven years. For all things, long duration leads to decay: such is the nature of fate. Yet decay may be repaired: this, too, is fate’s design.\n\nThe well had silted and collapsed for over forty years, and the simple folk of the village, though not negligent, knew not how to address it. Below, the pit yawned like a bottomless abyss; above, the crumbling edge hung like a sheer cliff, on the verge of breaking yet still clinging—so treacherous that no hand could find purchase. Then, on the second day before the Dragon Boat Festival in the first year of the Dade reign, *wushen*, as the sun neared its setting, a sudden wind and rain arose, and in an instant, the site was reduced to a wasteland of mud and shattered stone. Heaven seemed to lend its hand, compelling men to restore it—truly, this was fate’s decree.\n\nWhere there is land, there are people. And the people belong to Heaven. Blessed by Heaven’s fortune, in harmony with Heaven’s timing, and aligned with Heaven’s will, they consulted the omens and found them auspicious. Four days later, on the *yichou* day, laborers were gathered. With no other means, they hauled stones and cleared mud. To the north, on the sunny slope of Bie Peak, grew a vine as thick as seven or eight inches in diameter, its length straight and uncoiled, stretching over seven or eight *zhang*. They used it as a rope—what marvelous craftsmanship of creation! Could this not be Heaven’s aid to its people?\n\nBy the seventh day of the month, *jiawu*, stonemasons and earthworkers had assembled, and by *yisi*, the work was complete. Does this not mirror the *yisi* day of the well’s original founding? Or was it Heaven’s doing? It was Heaven’s.\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nDare I record these events in writing, to show the people and invoke the spirits? The words read:\n\nHeaven aids its people,\nWind and rain respond in kind.\nProphecies align with spirits,\nAnd thus the work began.\nOnce dredged, it draws from the depths,\nIts hidden flow reaching the Milky Way.\nNurturing people and aiding all things,\nIts merit and use are vast.\nThe eight spirits of the eight directions,\nThe royal kin and the mighty sword.\nWith martial clamor and military might,\nThey ward off misfortune and banish ill omens.\nPeople receive its blessings,\nYears yield abundant grain.\nDrinking from the spring, they know its pulse,\nEnveloped in Heaven’s grace.\nRestoring the old and renewing the well,\nThe task is thus accomplished.\nMay peace and tranquility endure forever—\n*Qian*: Origin, prosperity, harmony, and constancy.\n\n**Sealing the Well: An Inscription**\nThe meaning of the well is profound indeed.\nIn the heavens, it belongs to the twenty-eight constellations;\nIn the Five Phases, it is the essence of water;\nFor people, it serves the needs of drink and sustenance, indispensable even for a single day.\nThe well cannot be abandoned because its waters nurture people and aid all things.\nYet if it becomes silted and unclean, old and murky, it becomes a forsaken well.\nThus, the sages, in composing the hexagrams, declared:\n*A well silted is undrinkable; an old well attracts no birds.*\nThis is precisely because an old, forsaken well’s mud is unfit to drink.\nAs for birds and beasts not coming—it cannot nurture people or aid all things, but instead harms them.\n\nTo the east of the lane lies the temple grounds, where the mountain rises from Bie Peak, winding and undulating, its rises and falls uncounted, until it settles here. Long ago, someone quarried the mountain to dig a well, excavating until the spring was reached, nearly nine *ren* deep. Yet they feared abandoning the work, for their heart was set on nurturing people and aiding all things—even if it meant wounding the mountain, no harm was done.\n\nBut now, one enters the well yet cannot draw water. The well’s purpose is lost.\nThe thirsty cannot drink,\nThe soiled cannot cleanse.\nThe frogs in its depths fall silent,\nThe fish in its dried ruts nearly perish.\nLeft unused, it has lain thus for years.\nThe diviners call it the *Black Warrior pierced by an arrow*,\nThe physicians, a chronic ailment of the vital organs.\nThe clamor of opinions is great—this mountain has suffered no small wound.\n\nSince then, customs have changed, and the village has withered.\nMen of great talent, now impoverished gentlemen, bear no radiant glory.\nThe withering, the decay, the drowning in this—what could be worse?\nWhom to blame? The fault lies with the well.\n\nIn the ninth month of the *gui-si* year of the Zhiyuan era, on the auspicious *bing-zi* day, the villagers proposed sealing the well. They prayed to me, and I answered: \"Sealing it is auspicious.\" Thus, I compose this text to inform the well’s spirit:\n\nLong ago, Geng Gong dug a well fifteen *zhang* deep. He straightened his robes, bowed, and the well gushed forth with water. Yet when Prefectural Clerk Zhu Bo took up residence in an office with over a hundred chambers, all the wells ran dry. Both were wells—why did one benefit Geng Gong but not Zhu Bo? Was this partiality?\n\nMay the well’s spirit lower its head and heed this command, replying: \"It is not partiality, but fate.\nThat there was water was fate;\nThat there was none was also fate.\nTo open it when there was water, to seal it when there was none—this is proper.\nWhat concern is it to the spirits?\"\n\nYet where fate lies, human effort is tied.\nThus, the proposal to seal it arose.\nSeal it, I say:\nOn this day of sealing, spirits will guard it,\nWarding off misfortune and banishing ill omens.\nAfter sealing, may households prosper and suffice,\nMay people live long and in health.\n\n**On the Difficulty of Temple Restoration**\nThe responsibility of restoring the temple is arduous indeed—I have heard as much.\nYear-round labor, endless expenses—\nFrom dawn to dusk, no respite,\nIs it not difficult?\nExhausting ears and eyes, straining strength and thought—\nIs it not hard?\n\nThe rotted and blackened beams and buckets have now been repaired.\nThe broken and missing roof tiles have been restored.\nThe faded red and white hues have been renewed.\nWhose work is this? To call it solely one’s own would be excessive;\nYet one might shirk responsibility and evade the difficulty.\n\nNevertheless, the eastern pond’s inscription has dried up,\nThe western steps’ stele remains unerected,\nThe furnishings of the inner and outer halls are unworthy—\nWhat is to be done?\nIt is like setting out on a thousand-*li* journey, only to turn back at the gate—\nThis is not the conduct of a true man.\nA true man acts with righteousness as his weight,\nTo see righteousness and not act is cowardice.\n\nOf old, the two sons of the Lord of Gudu stood alone in their conduct, heedless of praise or blame—\nWere they acting for gain?\nMy sense of righteousness arises from innate nature,\nAs distant from those who seek fame and profit as heaven is from earth.\nPeople far and wide have heard and know this—\nEven without consulting spirits, there is no doubt,\nSo why must I speak so earnestly?\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says:\n*Though alone in your chamber, be not ashamed before the rafters.*\nThat which moves the spirits must be fitting.\nWhen the halls are restored, the walls erected, and all things prepared,\nThen offer sacrifices and present them,\nAnd reflect upon them—\nReverence will arise naturally.\nOtherwise, if one’s demeanor is even momentarily irreverent,\nA careless heart will deceive the spirits.\nNot only the spirits, but people too.\nNot only deceiving others, but deceiving oneself—\nWhat grandeur or solemnity can there be?\n\nThose who later tend to the temple,\nWalking these halls and reading this record,\nWill surely ask:\nWho were the eight who restored the temple?\nWho first proposed it?\nWho joined in the planning?\nAt first so diligent, in the end so negligent—\nThey too are people; what was their intent?\n\nAll things under heaven begin well, but few endure to the end.\nTo excel in both beginning and end—\nThis is the fulfillment of the human way.\n\nDifficult indeed is this—it is why I hasten so earnestly, seeking to ensure a strong beginning and a successful end.\n\nTo your question, I say: today’s scholars cannot proceed without wealth. Heaven does not send rain, spirits do not deliver offerings, the practice of alms-seeking yields nothing, and those willing to give generously are rarely seen. What plan, then, can be devised?\n\nI counsel you thus: when the multitude acts in accord, it must always treat righteousness as its profit. If profit is not taken as righteousness, no one will truly value righteousness, and the endeavor will not endure. Remember well this word: *righteousness*.\n\nI imagine those who joined this work rising abruptly, leaning against the wall, and declaring: “How dare we not accept this?”\n\n**Record of Completion**\n\nAffairs under heaven are not difficult at the outset—only in their conclusion. As the *Book of Songs* says: “All things have a beginning, but few endure to the end.” The *Book of Changes* states: “The fox crossing the river wets its tail”—speaking of how easy the start is, and how hard the finish.\n\nThus the noble person reveres the beginning and is cautious of the end, maintaining consistency from start to finish. This is called great good fortune. But if one is diligent at first and negligent at last, willingly yielding to the pressure of petty men—such are the schemes of those who achieve nothing. What use are they?\n\nTake, for example, the construction of this temple. At the beginning, there were eight of us. By the end, only seven remained. Of these, only three devoted themselves wholeheartedly. From this, we see clearly: affairs under heaven are not difficult at the start—only in their completion. This is indeed true.\n\nYet though the difficulty of completion may neither add to nor diminish my own standing, discerning observers will perceive in others the lack of resolve to see things through. How, then, can one hope to cultivate this as a field of blessing and seek its benefits?\n\nNow, six or seven of us have gathered in the courtyard to perform the rites of completion. Our merit lies in the altars of the state. We carve our inscription into metal and stone, that for a thousand generations to come, none may dare to neglect or forget.\n\nAs for the offerings—fine livestock, fragrant wine—our rites exceed what is proper, verging on excess. This is truly a shame for me. As the *Rites* in the *Tan Gong* says: “In sacrifice, if reverence is lacking but ritual is abundant, it is better to have ritual lacking and reverence abundant.” Here, both ritual and reverence are fully present. Why, then, does this record of completion seem to reproach me for insufficiency?\n\nThe numinous power of the spirits is indeed potent—why, then, do they not bestow a little more of it upon people? Such words are narrow indeed.\n\nWealth and honor are what all men desire; when desire is unfulfilled, there must be a seeking after it. Now you six or seven men, joining your strength for the royal house, have shown yourselves able to begin well and end well. I know full well that you harbor ambitions of great achievement. Heaven’s Dao and the numinous spirits bless the good. The mountains echo and the valleys respond, answering every sound—why, then, do brush and tongue labor so earnestly to speak for me?\n\nHave you not seen the portraits of meritorious ministers in the Lingyan Pavilion? Twenty-two men in all, yet those whose loyalty endured from beginning to end were but seven: Wei Zheng, Xiao Yu, Duan Zhixuan, Liu Honggong, Yao Silian, Yu Shinan, and Qin Shubao. Now you seven, if you can hold fast to this resolve to the end, may one day rise to the halls of state and take the affairs of the nation as your own responsibility. Why fear you will not match the deeds of those seven in the Lingyan Pavilion? How could your merit be confined to the mere repair of a temple?\n\nI dare offer this as encouragement and append it to the record of completion.\n\n---\n\n**Exorcism of the Pestilence Ghost**\n\nThe *Annals* say: The Marquis of Jin fell ill and dreamed of a bear, which he took to be a pestilence ghost. Later, Han Tuizhi, Liu Yuxi, and others—men renowned for their wisdom and insight, universally admired—also spoke of \"malaria ghosts.\" Some composed texts to drive them away, others wrote poems to dispel them. Only then did people begin to believe that autumn fevers and winter plagues were truly called \"ghosts.\"\n\nYet ghosts are formless and soundless—how could they sicken men? Moreover, man is the spirit of the myriad things. Heaven covers him, earth bears him, sun and moon illuminate him, wind and rain, frost and dew nurture him through the four seasons. Grain, millet, mulberry, and hemp clothe and feed him. I see how deeply the workings of creation attend to man. If the human Dao is not established, then what we call heaven and earth, sun and moon, wind and rain, frost and dew—I know not what they truly are, save that we name them so. Alas, they would be but lifeless clods!\n\nSince creation has brought forth man in this world, how could it permit such ghosts to afflict the people? It is not the ghost—nor is the ghost the sickness. Rather, it is intemperance in food and drink, indulgence in sensual pleasures, the scorching of the bowels by sweet, sour, bitter, and pungent flavors, the rotting of the stomach. Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight disorder the nature and dissolve the spirit. The body is not wood or stone; assailed by so much, how could it not fall ill?\n\nYet in ancient times, when men fell ill, they were treated with decoctions and acupuncture, and none failed to recover and live. Now, when men fall ill, neither decoctions nor acupuncture can reach them. Alas, truly are these ghosts obstinate and unyielding to transformation!\n\nI, by the mandate of the Supreme Emperor, guard this land and govern its people. If any bring poison and harm to my people, I shall consult the *Laws of the Mysterious Code of the Female Celestial* and decree that they be beheaded a thousand thousand times, their forms severed ten thousand ten thousand times, until all are reduced to hares scurrying into their burrows, with none left as fish slipping through the net. Only then may my people’s desires be fulfilled.\n\nNow, as the Lower Prime announces a general amnesty, I shall recite a verse by Master Du and proclaim it thus:\n\n*You, with skulls blood-smeared and grim,*\n*I seize and hurl back to Magistrate Cui!*\n*Ghost, if you have any power, flee—flee—flee!*\n*Linger but a moment, and the Heavenly Axe falls!*\n\nWritten on the *jiazi* day of the second lunar month in spring, the eighth year of the *Kaibao* reign of the Song (Year of *Yihai*), by the Old Man of Biefeng.\n\n---\n\n**Exorcism of the Drought Demon**\n\nYou, whose name is drought, are called *Chi*. I know your ancestor was the Flame Clan, who ruled the world by the virtue of fire and rendered great service to the people, earning the revered title of Flame Emperor. Your lineage was once illustrious, yet how degenerate you have become, so base and unworthy! Your form is hideous, your nature perverse. Even the poison of *Bifang* and the calamity of *Huilu* are not as severe as you.\n\nWhen the Xia sovereigns cast images upon their tripods, you were so terrified that you led your kind to flee to the lands of the tattooed and black-toothed peoples, where you have dwelled for many years. Once, you vied for dominance with the *Kuafu* clan, reversing the sun’s shadow to chase them between the valleys of *Cigu*, but parched and weary, you sought to drink the waters of *Mingbo* and the great marshes, only to fail. Thus, you stole life by surreptitiously drinking from the rivers of the human world, nearly draining the Luo and the Yellow in a single draught. This led to the *Song of Mulberry Grove* reaching the heavens, whereupon your crime was judged, and you were nearly exterminated.\n\nKing Xuan of Zhou and Duke Jing of Qi treated you with benevolence, sparing your punishment. Since then, your remnant seed has spread and multiplied to this day.\n\nI, by the mandate of the Supreme Emperor, guard this land and govern its people. The people toil year-round, for food is their heaven. The heart of Heaven cherishes my people—how could it not transform, how could it not send rain? Who is to blame if not you? The grain is about to ear, the millet to ripen—do you not consider this, yet bring such ruin upon them?\n\nThough you bear the form of man and the nature of things, examine your heart—can you truly bear this? The straw chariot is prepared, the provisions are ready. I pour you a cup of clear water and solemnly declare: The lands of the tattooed and black-toothed peoples, your ancient homeland, lie south of the sea. You may reach them by evening if you depart at dawn.\n\nNow I make this pact with you: By the end of this day, gather your companions, take your kin, ride the dust and spread the wind, and set forth at once. If you do not heed these words, proving yourself obstinate and insensate, I shall invoke the *Laws of the Mysterious Code of the Female Celestial*. Any who harm the people and creatures of the land—all shall say they deserve death, and they shall be killed. Heaven has its records and its net; punishment will reach you, and there shall be no regret.\n\nThus, this proclamation.\n\n**Exorcism Text to Drive Away Toad Miasma**\n\nLocusts shall not cross our borders; tigers shall flee with their cubs in tow—this is the sacred duty of those who guard the land, the righteous act of ridding the people of harm. Now, this miasma is called the \"Toad.\" Here, I compose this text to banish it.\n\nI once read in the *History of the Southern Dynasties* of a man named Qiu Jie, who fell ill after eating raw vegetables. Years later, he dreamed his mother told him: \"This is the poison of the toad. I leave you three pills—take them.\" He did, and voided several *dou* of toad spawn. Thus, the harm wrought by toads is indeed true.\n\nOf the creatures born of water, there are three hundred and sixty kinds. Among them, the toad is the most despised in Heaven and Earth. Its form is grotesque, its limbs scrabbling in the sand. Its belly swells, its throat constricts. Its color blends with mud, its diet is filth and dung. It leaps upon well-rails, rests in crumbling cliffs. Its dwelling is foul, its appearance vile. Day and night, it croaks, enslaved to demons.\n\n\"Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me—what place has the toad?\" Yet some say: The toad’s essence is a demonic thing. When the moon is full, it puffs its gut, bares its gaping maw, and raves in triumph. In the green-black void, it capers, devouring the essence of the Great Yin, disrupting Heaven’s order, ravaging Heaven’s creations. Such a witless beast—if even Heaven cannot endure it, how much less can man?\n\nNow the people—what crime have they committed to suffer such afflictions? The malady begins at the tip of a hair, festers in the joints and bones. At first, it brings stupor and blockage, dizziness and confusion. As it advances, the body twists, the sinews weaken, the waist grows heavy, the head spins. Nasal mucus flows like rain, the throat swells with phlegm, spittle and vomit choke the chest. Within, parched; without, desiccated—thirst without thirst—until searing heat erupts. Folk remedies and coal fumes, the fires of disaster, leave scorched heads and blistered brows, as though seated in a pit of flames. Even were one to ride the giant spirit, seize the Dipper’s ladle, and scoop the waters of the Bohai Sea to drench the flames, it would not suffice for relief. Some, born under the signs of *chen* and *xu*, sweat until the fever breaks. Others, once the heat subsides, are left with a dry cough that lingers for days, worsening without respite.\n\nI trace the source—whose fault is this? Is it not the autumn acting as summer, the imbalance of yin and yang? Or the five flavors indulged without restraint, the excesses of food and drink? Or the eyes fixed on dark and bright, the ears enslaved to lewd songs, the unchecked pursuit of sound and sensuality? What physician cannot cure it with medicine? What moxibustionist cannot apply the mugwort stove? The curses of the exorcist crackle like thunder, the talismans of the talisman-master slash like blades—yet the heart labors in vain, the eyes grow weary, and all efforts yield no result, their effects delayed. The people’s grievances converge upon one culprit: the toad.\n\nI, entrusted by the Supreme Emperor to govern this land and care for its people, find the toad still defiantly alive. It fills ditches as ghosts, becomes a demon-chief, a *chimei*, a *wangliang*, lurking in the dark, crouching in shadows. Treacherous and perverse, it stirs cruelty and oppression, devoid of mercy. The shadow-shooting of the short fox, the venom of the grass-biting centipede—none compare to the harm you wreak. Your crimes tower to the heavens; the people all cry for your death.\n\nNow I make this pact with the toads: Gather your kind within a single day and relocate together to the east of Lake Wanshan, where you may eke out a living, a borrowed existence—so long as you no longer harm my people. If not—if you remain stubborn and senseless, heedless of this warning—I shall commission the *Guo* clan to burn your dens and drown you in ash-laced wine. Then I will sever your heads, split your bellies, mince your flesh, and share it with the people to feast upon. Your kind must be eradicated to satisfy the people’s desires.\n\nHearing these words, the toads trembled in fear. Donning green robes, they knelt in the courtyard, begging for their lives: \"The willow-wheeled carts are ready, the red grass packed. We willingly submit and depart today. Spare us, O King, and pardon our crimes.\"\n\nThereupon, I composed this decree to hasten their departure:\n\n*\"Clear and upright, I embody the divine.\nBy Heaven’s mandate, I cherish the people below.\nO wretched toads, creatures of malevolence,\nRejoicing in calamity, why so cruel?\nDefying Heaven’s decree, you disrupt the seasons.\nThe people’s qi stagnates, their paths grow treacherous.\nEven Lu and Bian despair, their skills in vain.\nThe shamans chant and chew, their arts shrouded in darkness.\nWhat crime have the people committed to endure such suffering?\nO wretched toads, your sins overflow.\nThe people’s wrath gathers—your name is cursed.\nThey long to gnaw your bones, to mince your flesh.\nMy fury blazes like thunder and lightning.\nI entrust the Guo clan to execute justice.\nKneeling in the courtyard, you plead for mercy—\nA single cry for life, a reprieve from ten thousand deaths.\nO wretched toads, if you truly possess spirit,\nHear my words and reform.\nThe towering peaks of Wanshan, the limpid waters of the lake—\nThere lies your refuge, your haven of peace.\nGo deep, hide far, vanish from sight.\nDepart swiftly, swiftly—hasten as the law commands!\"*\n\nComposed in the third month of the *dingwei* day, spring of the eighth year of *Kaibao* in the Song dynasty (975).\n\n---\n\n**Ode on the Exorcism of Toads**\n\nThe people of Yue revere omens and believe in slaughter—an ancient custom, unshaken even now. When illness strikes, they grieve and fret. Yet the shamans and mediums warn: \"Without *ginseng* and *poria*, the cure demands blood.\" Some slander and deceive, currying favor with the crowd. Thus, I compose this *Ode on the Exorcism of Toads* to justify my actions. Its words read:\n\n*\"Alas, the world turned upside down—\nThe square wears the cap of the round.\nYin congeals into sores, the springs surge and flow.\nNightly, the blood-dripping specter roams the perilous forests.\nThe archer-demon lurks, listening for shadows to strike.\nHow can the pebble of Yan be mistaken for pearls?\nThe quack’s concoctions muddle yellow millet—who can tell true from false?\nThey accept tiles as gold, their thunderous clamor drowning the music of the *Xianchi* Pool.\nThey praise the beauty of the *Mo* mother, while the idle *Zou* son grows profligate and shameless.\nA wild bird enters the house—what omen does it bring?\nThe people lament and mourn.\nThe world craves the dregs of wine and pickled fare,\nYet I would feast on chrysanthemums and weave orchids.\nThe customs of the age oppress—\nMoths drawn to the flame, ants to the lamp.\nThe six excesses arise from imbalance—\nWhy blame frost and dew?\nThe cases of Shen and Tai Luo prove it—\nAre these not strange and unnatural?\nThey brandish spears and arrows like divining stalks,\nTheir words filthy, their claims absurd.\nThe dragon-horse reveals its form—\nLater, Fu Xi deciphered its celestial patterns.\nTo kill in pursuit of life—\nEven the southern wind cannot reverse it.\nThe bandits rage, drunk with power—\nThey deem all wood sacred.\nThe *Kui* burns for its recklessness—\nThe land suffers ever-greater drought.\nBetter to swallow charcoal and wail,\nOr face the wall and meditate.\nWhat crime have the fish and *zong* committed that the skies darken,\nTheir qi tangled in resentment?\nThey borrow the *Huiping* from the postmaster,\nBewildered by the snake in the cup.\nThey usurp creation’s harmony, tuning the pipes,\nHoping to thaw the ice and revive spring.\nThe mother clings to her child as the greatest concern,\nYet they cling to darkness, lost in ignorance.\"*\n\nTo call *changyang* useless for prolonging life—\nThen why seek *fuling*?\nThe net’s mesh tightens, the body ensnared—\nAlas, how can the valley’s whale endure?\nThus one drifts through the world’s currents,\nYet remains deluded by omens, never awakening.\nMoving the firewood earns no virtue—\nThe guest’s brow is scorched, his face seared.\nWho is to blame?\nThe base man’s gluttony, his schemes spun in cunning words.\nThe ringleaders of sin—\nMen indict them, ghosts demand their due.\nBorrowing metal and iron to slaughter,\nThey cast down order and plunge into chaos.\nCalling wrong right, right wrong—\nDo they not invert all things?\nMan’s triumph over heaven’s decree cannot deceive—\nLight endures, darkness fades.\nVying in their mad rush,\nThe tumors burst in ruin.\nTruly lamentable—\nWho would don a cap and shake their robes now?\nBeat the drum to rouse their stupor, illuminate their blindness—\nYet gloom lingers, unyielding.\nBetter to refuse all words—\nWithout me, all would perish.\nHair unbound, stammering—\n\n*Xu Xian’s Literary Flourishes, Scroll Four*

your concern—make them flourish and prosper, prosper and grow great, daily richer, daily longer-lived, daily in peace and well-being.\nLet them have enough to honor their fathers and mothers above,

Rank to govern their nobility.\n2. Emolument to govern their wealth.\nThough this be the prerogative of the Grand Steward, it is your duty, O sovereigns.\n\nProclaim to the lords of our allied states, the governors, the many officers, and the stewards: Hearken to Our ancient charge.\nWe have heard that when good persons do good, their descendants will surely have those who rise to continue it.\nFrom this day forward, for families that accumulate goodness, you shall register their rank and emolument.\n\nLet this office, in accordance with the decree, respectfully heed and faithfully implement it.\n\nThis office, reverently receiving the imperial edict, hereby promulgates the following conditions for registering emolument upon families that accumulate goodness:\n\n1.

Perpetual inheritance of prosperity and flourishing.\n\n*End of Scroll Five of Xu Xian’s Literary Flourishes*\n*Scroll Six of Xu Xian’s Literary Flourishes*\n\n**Preface on Friendship**\n\nThose who share the same path are called *peng* (companions); those who share the same aspirations are called *you* (friends). The meaning of friendship lies in neither flattery nor deceit, neither extravagance nor indulgence. It must first be realized in the heart before it can be called true kinship. If companionship exists without sincerity, it is mere superficial association. If friendship exists without sincerity, it is but a face-value friendship. The noble person does not partake in such.\n\nNow, you have sought from me inscriptions for paintings, and I have named them after the *Five Friends*: Friend Pine, Friend Bamboo, Friend Plum—these are the *Three Friends of Winter*. Friend Orchid—this is what Confucius meant when he said, \"Dwelling with a good person is like entering a room of orchids and iris; over time, one no longer detects the fragrance, for one has become one with it.\" Friend Chrysanthemum—truly, does not the chrysanthemum embody the Dao of the noble person with its noble fragrance? The meaning of these *Five Friends*—can it not be trusted?\n\nIn painting, nothing is more difficult than capturing the true likeness. Yet capturing the likeness is not the greatest challenge—capturing the form is harder still. But even capturing the form is not the hardest—capturing the heart is. Human hearts differ as widely as their faces. The noble and the petty may appear similar in countenance, but their hearts are not the same. If one abandons the heart and seeks only the outward form, one reduces the noble to the petty. Though this painting exists, who does not possess such a painting? Now that you have named these *Five Friends*, you must take the heart as your enduring companion. Thus it is said: *To judge by form is not as good as to judge by heart.*\n\n---\n\n**A Record of the Painter**\n\nI once read Liu Zihou’s *Biography of the Carpenter* and Han Tuizhi’s *Biography of the Decayed Wang Chengfu*, and was deeply moved. The purpose of a biography is to transmit a name. Reflecting on those times, carpenters and decayed men were as common as flowing water—why were only Yang Qian and Wang Chengfu remembered? As the Grand Historian once told Ren An: \"In ancient times, those who were wealthy and noble yet whose names were erased are beyond counting.\" These two men gained their fame through the biographies written by those two masters—how fortunate they were!\n\nNow, there is a man who makes himself known through painting. I fear his name may not be transmitted to posterity, so I dare to follow the example of the ancients and compose this record for him:\n\nIn Jishan Village of Min, there has stood the Temple of the Divine Aid King for many years. Its painted decorations had long faded into obscurity, its walls crumbling, nearly becoming a den for spring worms and autumn snakes. In the *guisi* year of the Zhiyuan era, the villagers restored it, wishing to repaint and renew it. Soon, those who licked brushes and ground ink arrived in droves, but no decision was made on whom to employ. They consulted me, but I refused their request. The villagers were astonished, finding it strange—was there some master who had stripped off his robes and sat cross-legged, yet had not yet arrived?\n\nOne day, a painter suddenly appeared, moved by a dream. Only then did they believe my words were true. Observing the man, he was steadfast and upright, refined and untrammeled by俗, dressed in the robes of a scholar. He did not speak his name, nor did anyone know his origins. That day, when gentlemen gathered to discuss integrity, he sighed and said: \"The greedy follow profit, the heroic follow fame. I have come for fame, not for profit. My name has long been known in other lands, but this region has not yet heard of it. Let me try—if I succeed, so be it.\" The temple’s protective walls bore old, incomplete paintings, so he was ordered to complete them with his brush. He rose eagerly, though a trace of reluctance remained—his skill had yet to be proven. The onlookers clapped their hands and laughed, saying: \"He has a hollow reputation! This is nothing but copying gourds or tracing horses from diagrams—what is there to praise?\"\n\nI then assigned him to paint the eastern and western galleries and admonished him: \"Painting has six principles: first, *qi* and movement that bring life; second, bone and strength in brushwork; third, responding to things and capturing their forms; fourth, applying colors according to their kind; fifth, planning and positioning; sixth, transmission and copying. In your painting, you must consider these six principles and seek beyond mere form. Perhaps then you will succeed.\"\n\nThe painter replied: \"Understood.\"\n\nThereupon, he ground cinnabar, sipped white pigment, diluted ink, and thickened smoke. Grasping his brush, he studied intently, and after several days, completed the work. He painted armored warriors, one hundred and twenty-eight in total: two commanding generals, two seal-bearers, two standard-holders, four axe-wielders, two charioteers, two umbrella-bearers, two hat-attendants, two executioners, four messengers and order-givers, two interpreters, four gong-and-drum strikers, two cymbal players, two advancing with Han Xin sabers, eight standing at attention with slashing sabers, twenty-six with spears at hand and swords at waist, four vanguard formation-arrangers, two name-flag bearers, four signal-flag bearers, two merit-flag bearers, sixteen bearing the Eight Trigrams and Eight Arrays flags, two falconers, eight tribute-bearers from the southern lands, and the rest wielding bows, arrows, halberds, spears, and polearms, all in service. Their appearances were imposing, their ranks disciplined, their momentum continuous, their movements coordinated from head to tail. Orderly and systematic, precise and reasoned—truly, they embodied the strategies of the *Six Secret Teachings* of the Grand Duke and the military methods of Sun Wu.\n\nAdditionally, there were two retinues of attendants, forty-eight in all, their waists adorned with gold and purple, dutifully carrying out their tasks. They led and followed, flanked left and right, their artistry so exquisite it seemed as though real people were present. All who saw it marveled, saying: \"Your painting is indeed masterful! Why was it so crude before, yet so refined now? Why was it so inferior before, yet so excellent now?\" As the ancients said: *\"Great skill appears clumsy; great wisdom appears foolish.\"*\n\nThat, indeed, is what it means.\n\nThe painter Ni Shou slowly replied: \"What your servants painted before was merely capturing appearances to complete forms, fulfilling their structures to serve their functions. Others may have intentions, but divining them is no easy task—heart and tongue contend. What is called 'clumsy' and 'foolish' is truly so.\n\nWhat your servants paint today arises from the heart, envisioned in the mind’s eye, spiritually grasped and intuitively understood, flowing with the moment as the brush is commanded, in harmony with nature. We do not know why it becomes refined or crude, nor why it becomes excellent or inferior. We simply exhaust our artistry in the doing, not employing any cunning or clever technique.\n\nThen, can the fame of your servant’s painting truly be discussed?\"\n\nWhen the painting was finished, he inscribed it on the wall: *\"Painted by so-and-so on such-and-such a day and month.\"* The inscription merely records the name.\n\nAlas! If he were like that, then he too would seek fame through painting in the world and for posterity.\n\nAh! When a man is born with a seven-foot frame, he is the most numinous being between heaven and earth. With mulberry bow and reed arrows, his aspirations extend to the four directions. He must establish himself, practice the Dao, and make his name known to later generations to honor his parents—only then is a man’s duty complete. Otherwise, he is as if gagged and silenced, stifled and confused, content to be a jar or urn, like a brewing insect, growing old and dying to rot with the grasses and trees. Compared to the painter, would he not feel shame?\n\nWho is this painter? Cai Mengchen of Yurong.\n\nWho wrote the biography of Cai Mengchen? The Xuanfeng Lingji King.\n\n---\n\n**Postscript to Zhou Zhuangweng’s Stele Inscription**\n\nWhat I have written before and after is merely for my own amusement—truly, like a wild dog eating celery, unaware of the sting in its mouth or the pain in its belly, how could it know the taste?\n\nYet I am unworthily honored by your lofty friendship and pure prose, flowing like the mighty Yellow River. Your praise of my virtue shines resplendently.\n\nAs for the numinosity of mountains and rivers and the flourishing of people, there must surely be those of extraordinary talent, Daoist arts, loyalty, and integrity born among them. Like you, who harbor ability and hold potential, long suppressed—if you could rouse yourself to stand out and respond to your circumstances, even slightly, it would be my deepest hope.\n\nWhat I call the *spiritual* is virtue rooted in intelligence and uprightness, aligned with the seasons in its timing and applied to the myriad things with appropriateness. It is not the kind of spirit that flatters or curries favor to bring fortune.\n\nOf the hundred things seen morning and night, no one pays them heed. But when something extraordinary is heard of, all gaze upon it and speak of it. What you have asked me to postscript is also in hope of such extraordinary work.\n\n*\"The song ends, no one is seen— / On the river, several green peaks remain.\"* Is this not a poem of the spiritual? I dare use it to express my gratitude.\n\n---\n\n**Postscript to Zhou Zhuangweng’s *Explanation of the Yi Diagrams***\n\n\"Lingji\" is merely a temple name—why is it called a *king*? Those who hear of it cannot avoid offending the brush of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.\n\nThough I dare not refuse the honor of writing a postscript to your *Explanation of the Diagrams*, the profound meanings of the *Yi* are most abstruse—how can they be fathomed with a bamboo tube or a gourd dipper?\n\nI wished to take up my brush but feared being laughed at by those who carry firewood. Thus, I have gathered the discussions of earlier scholars and, with effort, written this postscript. If I have not fully grasped your intent in the middle, I have trimmed it away—may you find it fortunate.\n\nThe study of the classics has long been unclear. Our dynasty venerates schools and cultivates talent, placing the illumination of the classics as the foremost duty. The authorities promote education and governance, and for each classic, an instructor is appointed to guide its study—such is the earnest and diligent intent of their instruction.\n\nOf all the classics, the *Yi* is the most profound and recondite, not easily understood in its entirety. Those who study Wang Bi’s *Yi* engage in lofty discourse on principle, but their flaw is reckless extravagance. Those who study Jing Fang’s *Yi* rigidly adhere to images and numbers, but their flaw is inflexibility. Gaining in one aspect means losing in another; in the end, both are lost.\n\nMaster Jianxin Zhou of Sanshan, known as Gongbi in his official travels, possesses the *Yi Shaozheng Transmission* handed down in his family. It harmonizes both principle and images, and its words are purely and correctly derived.\n\nThe *Yi* has sixty-four hexagrams, and each hexagram discusses its primary line. Each line has its image, for which a diagram is made. Each diagram has its principle, for which an explanation is given. The explanations grasp principle, the diagrams grasp images and numbers—unified in one thread, they proceed without contradiction.\n\nI say that Master Zhou’s study of the *Yi* is refined—how could this be achieved in a single morning or evening?\n\nThe son of a skilled archer learns to make baskets; the son of a skilled furrier learns to make fur garments. If the transmission is not correct, how could one create diagrams and explanations that fully grasp the essence of the *Yi*?\n\nOne day, a fellow student of Master Zhou—unknown to me—tucked the diagrams and explanations into his sleeve and sought my opinion. I am ignorant and unlearned; glancing at them, though not easily understood, I grasped a thing or two. It is like food: when it comes to rare delicacies from distant lands, who would not crave them?\n\nI wished to write a postscript for carving and printing, to spread its transmission and not betray Master Zhou’s learning. Yet I fear my name is obscure and unworthy of the task.\n\nMaster Zhou’s given name is Zhuangweng, his courtesy name Zhibo, and Jianxin is his sobriquet.

me fulfills a long-held kinship.\n\nMy writings wear thin with revision,\nYet I cherish the honor of your fine mats.\nI gladly mingle with the misty haze,\nEnvious of the painted qilin’s pair.\nWang Di’s legacy should be true,\nChu Suiliang’s calligraphy is peerless.\nGao and Cen walk at a measured pace,\nGeng and Jia are also revered ministers.\nThe dense bamboo laughs in winter,\nA faint fragrance borrows from the islet’s duckweed.\nIn pure discourse, one tastes its savor,\nYet sidelong glances pain the spirit.\n\nA clear mirror hung brings weariness,\nThoughts stir like fish in a dried-up pool.\nLate, I ponder the author’s intent—\nAgain, he takes things to be spring.\nThe morning’s breath admires those with purpose,\nKnowing my laziness is genuine.\nLike Xu Ruzi, I am

weariness craves rest,\nYet lotus after lotus is no dream—my eyes see clearly.\n\nYour countenance smiles as if alive,\nThe moon’s beauty shines down, illuminating the rafters.\nCrane-capped and crane-cloaked, you ride a dragon’s plow,\nAhead, a cicada-chariot; behind, a team of four.\nLeft banners, right standards, dancing pennants,\nEmpty songs and grand music fill the air.\nPine and willow line the lane, yet it sits in a bustling market,\nWinding paths diverge north and south.\nWho carved the stone wall’s inscriptions?\nOyster-shell phoenixes leap and flutter in hooked strokes.\nTo the west, the Hall of Western Restraint stands on one side,\nTo the east, the Hall of True Unity belongs to the Great Mystery.\nOn the hall’s stars hang lanterns like ten thousand *hu* of lotuses,\nExotic

peak.\nSixty warriors clad in armor,\nTheir might and fury wild and boundless.\nOne sees only their fur bristling, shoulders trembling,\nSouls and dreams flying away and returning.\nThe tale of the plantain deer is indeed true—\nThe gulf between the hidden and the manifest is as vast as heaven and abyss.\n\nWhat has passed flows like a river,\nFaint as a battle’s flank, yet my worries burn.\nUnable to fulfill filial duty to the end,\nI must cast aside this body in grief.\nThe tale of Lotus City is told in the world—\nI wish to follow Su Shi and continue its legacy.\nYet the affairs of mourning and life’s entanglements press,\nMy laughter fades, my voice grows hoarse—I cannot match its elegance.\n\nI do not delight in jest or mockery,\nBut wish to show later generations what is so.\nYour plot of land is level and smooth,\nPlanted with melons and willows, may they flourish.\nI firmly believe the Way of Heaven is straight as a bowstring,\nYet you received the Emperor’s favor, singular and devoted.\nDesires approach—you heard them first,\nTo prosper your descendants and glorify your ancestors.\nYour family’s caps and sashes fill the gates,\nSoon, the old possessions will return to the green felt.\nAdmiring your virtue, I emulate Shen and Qian,\nDo not betray your mother’s steadfast will—do not err.\nDedicate yourself to books and history, strive with diligence,\nAvoid other pursuits, do not favor pipes and strings.\n\nYour grand deeds are a true field of blessing,\nYour family’s legacy flows like an unceasing stream.\nA great mansion’s support is not just eight hundred bushels,\nUnder Xi’s shelter, joy and safety abound.\nAlways remember to offer sacrifices, advance the rituals,\nTo perpetuate the family’s affairs with diligence.\nYour dream’s emotions are entwined,\nWhat you saw was not inverted or confused.\nIt aligns like lotus roots and stems,\nEvery sign and omen confirms it.\n\nThe Creator speaks not, yet subtly turns the wheel,\nRevealing your virtue for all to see.\nI record these events, inscribing them on bamboo,\nThough onlookers shrink back, fearing involvement.\n\n*For Lord Lin of East Village*\nKing Zhou’s cruelty married the woman of Su,\nThe man from the Eastern Sea fished at Ox Mountain.\nThe First Emperor’s wrath burned his books,\nThe tragedy of Xinggu was a crime deserved.\nZhengze wandered far from women,\nWishing to join

record—since receiving the seal and cover,\nI am asked for an inscription to extol its virtues and fulfill its aspirations.\nIt must match Sun Chuo’s prose,\nThen be carved in stone, preserving the ancient style of thirty-eight lines,\nFrom one to ten, then ten back to one.\nStele, record.\nThe spirit is rather extraordinary.\nNot for fame, merely to narrate the events.\nThough pleased to appraise, I am especially grateful not to be spurned.\n\nIt receives blood offerings in this region,\nIts name heard across the Five Dynasties.\nBeginning in the Kaiyun Jiachen year,\nNow the Zhiyuan

bound to the east?\nStay awhile, sir,\nThe message lingers in the passage.\nTomorrow, magpies’ cries will brim with joy,\nAnd this day, we meet again.\n\nMy temples are not yet wild with age,\n\"Peace and safety\"—these two words\nAre my family’s creed.\nHow can I bear this hazy moonlight,\nSeeing Chang’e call her maiden?\nDouble-Bloom, surnamed Dong,\nQueen Mother soaring in the void.\nNow, good

revels.\nVying in finery, silks and satins, pure and soft,\nNot to mention mounds of yellow gold.\nGold fills the hollow—\nFan Li of Tao was once Zhu of Yi, who changed his name and returned to his homeland.\nAt Qi’s gate, he played the zither, unrecognized in his time,\nLooking back, the minister’s seal was but a worn-out tray.\nA worn-out tray—\nHuman life is but a butterfly’s dream,

Cai**\n\nA master’s brush brings forth art from nature,\nGu Kaizhi and Yan Liben inherited its transmission.\nThough the craftsman’s skill is prized, the brush may seem clumsy,\nThe pigments deep and rich, the colors all the more vivid.\nOn the wall, his name endures for ten thousand ages,\nAmong men, his fame spreads to three thousand guests.\nNow, as we part, I am filled with sorrow—\nA humble cup of wine, a poem to send him off.\n\n**Four Daoist Masters Manifest at the Altar’s Construction**\n\nFour immortals descend to the luminous altar,\nPity those who see with different eyes.\nClad in

pitiable—Zhao Meng, ever earnest in his advice.\n\nIn stillness, I laugh at the world’s people,\nWho know not the causes of past and future lives.\nAll are but karmic shrines from the Jin of Shi,\nWho knew they once belonged to the kingdom of Min?\nWealth and nobility, ten thousand kinds, vanish like dreams,\nHow many heroes have already turned to dust?\nDiligently practice deeds of kindness,\nNo need for more earnest words.\n\nThe spirit’s manifest power lies in man,\nOr perhaps not—heaven has no cause.\nA single heroic soul swallows the cosmos,\nA thousand ancient temples adorn Min and

plunges straight down in rainbow spray.\nThe immortals, late returning from gathering essences,\nIdly play with murmuring streams and medicinal mud.\n\n**Bamboo Cliff After Snow**\nThe sacred cliff retains its auspicious snow,\nDawn’s light now brightens the clearing sky.\nPiled whiteness cradles the first rays,\nFrozen splendor gleams in the Great Clarity.\nLow, it buries the bent bamboo;\nHigh, it crushes the ancient pine.\nI long to soar to the perilous summit,\nStrolling at leisure in a crane-feather cloak.\n\n**Immortal Isle’s Sacred Fungus**\nDazzling, resplendent—threefold blossoms flourish,\nThe harmonious qi of the Great Peace nurtures this spiritual root.\nDwelling hidden here, how to repay its grace?\nPlucked and offered to Yu Yan, presented to the Supreme Lord.\n\n**Returning Tide at Green Bank**\nAt the farthest bank, the cold tide recedes,\nWinding and distant, the view stretches wide.\nGrass roots cling to scattered stones,\nThe river’s mouth reveals level sands.\nBirds peck at the broken green mud,\nBoats moor to ancient, slanting willows.\nIn but a moment, the tide returns again—\nFrom here, I set sail on a transcendent raft.\n\n**Travelers at South Pond**\nWheels and hooves rush to and fro,\nThe road links north and south, passing through Min’s mountains.\nPity the restless souls in the red dust—\nHow can they compare to the immortal palace’s leisurely days and months?\n\n**Wood Ridge’s Woodcutter’s Song**\nThe woodcutter’s song echoes from Wood Ridge,\nThe rugged path darkens as the sun sinks.\nMelodious, it drifts across winding streams,\nGentle, it emerges from layered forests.\nLow, it mingles with the golden cicadas’ tune;\nHigh, it follows the white cranes’ cries.\nWithin the jade palace, no vulgar notes—\nHearing this, the heart’s cares dissolve.\n\n**Bell Mountain’s Pagoda**\nAs the sun rises, Bell Mountain’s air feels new,\nA seven-tiered pagoda surges in phosphorescent splendor.\nSince ancient times, this blessed land has borne the wise and noble—\nIn this sagely age, those inscribed are not few.\n\n**Two Poems for Xu Nancun**\nMud and wood assume forms—how laughable indeed,\nYet you patch rustic words into poetic lines.\nSir, you are no Master Pang,\nYet how does your lamp’s light pervade the great chiliocosm?\n\nAshamed I lack the skill to season the broth,\nI playfully blend all things into fragrant harmony.\nFeasting in the butcher’s hall, one knows many flavors—\nMock not the mountain dweller’s wild greens and amaranth.\n\n**Ten Marvelous Peaks of Jade Mountain**\n\n**Golden Immortal Peak**\nThe cinnabar turtle’s thousand-year embers have turned to ash,\nOnly its towering stone halls remain, jagged and grand.\nCasually ascend the summit to gaze afar—\nBeyond the clouds, the verdant Five Terraces rise.\n\n**Heavenly Pillar Peak**\nStep by step, nearing the mountain’s front,\nSuddenly, bell tones shatter the dawn mist.\nA peak abruptly rises, sheer as a wall—\nIts strength seems enough to prop up the sky.\n\n**Sunrise Peak**\nAt dawn, the stone cliff pierces the clouds,\nDripping spring sounds chill the night air.\nI thought only the gibbons’ cries marked the predawn,\nYet when I open the door, the sun has climbed three poles high.\n\n**Third Young Master’s Peak**\nBy the Fishing Creek, a fishing boat,\nI ask the passerby—do you know his surname?\nWith a smile, I point to this mountain’s refined charm:\nWildflowers, singing birds—enough for carefree wandering.\n\n**Golden Splendor Peak**\nFrom afar, it seems a painting, seizing heaven’s artistry,\nHazy mountain light reflects the evening glow.\nThe pines and firs atop the ridge hold ancient intent—\nWho knows that in the dead of night, the robe has already been passed?\n\n**Rising Cloud Peak**\nFor miles, the path winds around the mountain’s flank,\nDawn’s hues remain dim, the mist not yet dispersed.\nScratching my head in the blue haze, I lose the way—\nOnly the sound of a single thunderclap from the mountain’s base.\n\n**Treasure Terrace Peak**\nLayer upon layer, its form rivals Kunlun’s cliffs,\nThe gallery path seems celestial, beyond climbing.\nA single point of pure light ever shines before me—\nPine winds and cassia moons make a fine livelihood.\n\n**Great Seat Peak**\nAfter rain, the mountain mist dyes the peaks dark,\nThe stone path is slick, few travelers pass.\nThe meditator naturally grasps the dharma of meditation—\nFrom where does the cold bell toll at dawn?\n\n**Jade Angelica Peak**\nA single heavenly flower, still unopened,\nWho plucks it and does not offer it?\nStraight to the summit’s peak I sit,\nAt times, its fragrance wafts to Tiantai.\n\n**Twin Lads Peak**\nThe hanging terrace’s bright mirror turns with the clear light,\nThe Jade Maiden once tested the morning’s zither.\nEver like maidens in their youthful days,\nForever young, their hair never turns white.\n\n**East Stream**\nThe stream’s voice is just this—water murmuring,\nEver constricted, it flows away and does not return.\nCountless worldly affairs are all thus—\nHow can they compare to the white gulls’ leisure on the sand?\n\n**West Stream**\nIn the mountains, idle guests visit one another,\nI ask those coming from the west—their intent?\nNeither increasing nor decreasing, without hindrance,\nFollowing the current, they pass through the Heavenly River.\n\n**Jade Cliff**\nI love the mountain, thus I love the jagged stone,\nThe jade-grade mountain becomes a jade brother.\nTwin streams divide, sending white egrets forth,\nTen peaks encircle, half green and half withered.\nIn the mortar of light clouds, tea holds many flavors;\nBy the lamp of the waning moon, a volume of scripture.\nBy chance, I reach the upper hall to ask of Chan—\nSurely they know I am no ordinary man.\n\n**Two Poems Seeing Off Chen Daoxing to Dragon-Tiger Mountain**\nWithin Zhongnan Mountain lie many fine scenes,\nYet alas, the ambition for fame and rank still smolders.\nOn the Dragon-Tiger Board, a new name appears—\nPlum blossoms first claim the hundred flowers’ primacy.\n\nRecommending the true and evaluating the worthy—this is ancient numen,\nAiding others’ good deeds paves the way ahead.\nMagpies call to report news of peace—\nI compose these verses to send you on your journey.\n\n**Matching Monk Dejian of White Cloud**\nSpeak not of Qin, Sui, Jin, Han, or Tang—\nThe three gates, the thatched hut, the land of white clouds.\nThe water buffalo does not leave; the mountain’s old man is false—\nI ask you: in those years, did you burn incense?\n\n**Four Occasional Poems**\nWithin stillness, heaven and earth reckon not the spring,\nAffirming and negating—let the myriad things whirl.\nWhere now are Xing Yuan and Zui Bai?\nBeyond the clouds, green mountains—mountains beyond clouds.\n\nI once heard the song of the captured unicorn,\nOnly to learn that Master Gao was a fine man.\nThe lotus flower, about to speak, holds many sentiments—\nHow can it compare to the speechless flower’s sunlit spring?\n\nWhere to seek the bright moon and clear wind?\nPoets’ bitter thoughts dissolve in wine.\nForgetting schemes, unconcerned if others understand,\nThe sand gulls alone know this heart.\n\nTwo autumns have passed since I forgot you,\nThis feeling remains unspoken—do you know it?\nBeyond the green mountain gate, many sentiments linger,\nLeft for poets to take as their topic.\n\n*End of Xu Xian’s Literary Works, Scroll Seven*\n*Beginning of Xu Xian’s Literary Works, Scroll

hand.\n\nThe moon clears, the wind gentle—such grace is found everywhere,\nBest to chant poems and pour wine.\nAutumn comes, cold dew chills,\nYet why not paint lightly or boldly as you please?\nBy the fence, golden chrysanthemums bloom,\nTheir late virtue still fragrant as they age.\n\n*\"To the Tune of ‘Geng Lou Zi’ – For Zhou Ming\"*\nA tranquil family’s virtue is finest,\nDelighting in pond lotuses and window grasses.\nLeaning on the desk, resting by the rail,\nAll pure fragrance flows as one.\nA sliver of moon hangs low,\nUnnoticed, the fifth watch arrives.\nThe lamp reports joy as

where white clouds idle.\n\n*\"To the Tune of ‘Xiang Jian Ju’ – For Zhang Guilong\"*\nWind mild, sun warm—two or three springs,\nRain clears, skies blush red and purple.\nA hundred flowers like brocade, willows like silk floss,\nFrom the high tower, pearl curtains roll up.\nThe master’s home,\nOnce more welcomes the returning pair of swallows,\nLet the calendar be woven anew.\n\n*\"To the Tune of ‘Ye Jin Men’ (Also ‘Xi Xiang Yi Qiao’) – For Guo Yongfang\"*\nClouds thin, rain thick,\nFebruary’s hundred flowers bloom red.\nTravelers come and go,\nEast or west, as the wind differs for ox

course.\n\n*\"To the Tune of ‘Ying Tian Chang’ – For Zheng Ruxian\"*\nSwallows and orioles dance face to face,\nRelying on the Eastern Lord to rule forever.\nRain then clear, clear then rain,\nPlayfully ask the peach blossoms—they smile but do not speak.\nThe sun sets behind western hills,\nClouds veil the dusk,\nCrows weary of flight return home.\nShould you ask where the future’s goodness lies,\nIn the full moon of the fifteenth night.\n\n*\"To the Tune of ‘Shan Hua Zi’ – For Guo Yili of Tianyi Temple\"*\nAlone he bolts the wicker gate, unconcerned with worldly affairs,\nWhat in this world equals clouds’ idleness?\nDo not say the heartless always drift from the peaks,\nFor even they know to return—not as mist, not as smoke.\nIn nothingness, King Xiang’s dream of Wu,\nCold in brocade robes.\nOne offering of heart’s incense,\nThis is the true dwelling in famous mountains.\n\n*\"To the Tune of ‘Shuang Tian Xiao Jiao’ – For Taihe Mountain Monk De Run\"*\nA staff flies through empty space,\nA hundred-foot robe and bowl passed down.\nSilently listening to morning bells and evening drums,\nFire extinguished in the heart’s core.\nIncense fills the golden

blow.\nFrom here to the Western Heaven, ten thousand miles and more,\nWalking to and fro, again and again.\n\n*\"Repairing the Palace, Sewing Robes – To the Tune of ‘Man Gong Chun’\"*\nMending the eastern wall, patching the western,\nEvery task uneven, not the same.\nWhere the human heart is steadfast, stone can be pierced,\nLet us all exert our strength together.\nEmbroidered silk robes,\nStitched silk skirts,\nCosting a thousand needles, ten thousand threads.\nWhere effort is great, value is high,\nSurely fame will rise and shine.\n\n*\"To the Tune of ‘Xi Qian Ying’\"*\nSeeing no shadow, hearing no sound,\nYet in the dark room, a spirit lingers.\nNot incense by morning, not lamp by night,\nSincerity may dwell in the square inch of the heart.\nTurning to clouds, covering as rain,\nWorldly affairs cycle thus.\nAncient vines and old trees endure through many springs,\nNow once more renewed.\n\n*\"To the Tune of ‘Xi Xi Sha’ – For Painter Cai\"*\nA master of brush and ink, the world acclaims,\nI once composed verses for *Huatang Chun*,\nWho knew the marvel would capture the spirit?\nFour limbs flawless in beauty,\nEyes left unmarked to preserve truth,\nWas Gu Kaizhi

The sacred precincts are stern and bright—how dare we presume to petition before the celestial throne? Overwhelmed and trembling, we can neither advance nor retreat.\n\nYour servant [Name] respectfully reflects: the Primordial Master, the Heavenly Master, holds the sacred rank, his Dao transmitted from the Prior Heaven, his teachings proclaimed through a hundred generations as the covenant of truth, an eternal transmission for the unlearned. We, your servant, though charged with ritual duties and bound by precepts, dare not act alone in private schemes without first submitting this plea. There are established precedents—we must await the guidance of left and right hands, never straying from the law. The ranks of East and West must stand as one, each in their proper place. On an auspicious day, we shall perform the Luotian Jiao rites to express our gratitude to Lingji Zhenren. Yet we fear that fellow altar practitioners may not yet heed the wondrous teachings, and though we strive together in the Dao, we dare not prolong this petition further. The statutes prescribe penalties for transgressions—we tremble lest we violate their severity.\n\n**Petition of Gratitude for the Appointment of Xuanbiao Zhenjun**\n\nWe, in awe and trepidation, bow our heads again and again. We reverently consider the Marshal, the Great Dharma Master, whose merit pervades transformation and nurture, whose Dao penetrates the profound and subtle. As rivers and marshes flow boundlessly, all return to the sea in homage. Yet before the radiance of sun and moon, who would dare cover their eyes? We gaze toward Heaven to repay its grace, yet our devotion remains imperfect, our efforts exhausted. Our transgressions pile like mountains, our merits weigh no more than dust. Yet by your gracious indulgence, you heed our words without rejection.\n\nWe, your servant, though dwelling in the Cavern of Truth, remain unenlightened, aged and incapable. Yet through the intercession of memorials, we are deemed worthy. How could we presume to advance in the immortal ranks, coveting merit or usurping rank? Now, as Xu [Name] and others are elevated in rank and bestowed imperial favor, we, who partake of the land’s bounty, share in the gratitude for life’s blessings. With hands raised and feet dancing, we unite in reverent joy. To speak further would be presumptuous—we fear only transgression.\n\n**Petition of Gratitude for the Bestowal of Rank**\n\nThe rites for warding off calamity and averting disaster are solemnly observed. Those who build merit and accumulate virtue deserve advancement in the immortal ranks. Though the divine cannot be measured, our thoughts and words must be laid before them.\n\nWe, in awe and trepidation, bow our heads again and again. We recall the Yellow Emperor, who sought the essence of the supreme Dao from Guangchengzi, and the Magistrate of Sangkan, who followed Lord Lao to fathom the mysteries of the profound and dark. Vast and boundless, the Dao eludes all grasp—expansive as a valley, it embraces the ten thousand things. Broad and ever-flowing, it transcends the small and incomplete. It does not abandon simplicity, and in its vastness, all things find completion. To align with the times is the mechanism of rising above the mundane and entering sainthood; to hold fast to the center and embrace the One is the essence of learning.\n\nThe Primordial Yang Jade Calendar must be entrusted to the right person. The precious scriptures of the Most High condense the qi of spontaneity. When mortals recite them, their lives are prolonged; when spirits hear them, they ascend as immortals. Each bears the karmic causes of past lives, and thus their merits defy all reckoning.\n\nWe, your servant, though longing for the Dao, lack the talent of the worthy. We have not mastered the method of extracting lead and merging mercury in the golden elixir, yet we dare to undertake the duty of submitting sealed memorials. We reflect further on the Jiao leaders, who, sheltered by the divine, dwell in peace within their villages, honored at the shrine of Lingji. Endowed with wisdom and virtue, they bring timely sunshine and timely rain, fulfilling the auguries of tortoise and milfoil. Their merit serves the state, their blessings nourish the people—we recall the enduring joy inscribed on their monuments. Though millet and sorghum lack fragrance, we offer them in sacrifice. On the mornings of the Three Origins when blessings converge, we observe a day of fasting and abstinence. By the grace of the Heavenly Master above and the imperial favor below, we are adorned with honorific titles, our names resplendent. Such glory is unheard of in antiquity and unmatched in the present age.\n\nThis is all due to the august presence of the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven. The vault of Heaven arches above, the Emperor governs all—beneath his encompassing gaze, his benevolence has long been celebrated. We, your servant, are but lowly as ants and lice, foolish and dull. Only when we behold the celestial majesty of dragon and phoenix do we dare to speak. Though the divine may rely on talent, how could we idly occupy our positions? We must not fabricate affairs to seek merit. We have received more than our due—our gratitude is boundless. Yet we remain as one who clings to a tattered robe, ever mindful of treading on thin ice.\n\nWe humbly pray that your majesty’s virtue may endure for a hundred generations, that your blessings may descend in abundance, and that the imperial mandate may bestow prosperity upon all people. We, your servant, dare not cease in our reverence and awe. With this memorial, we respectfully express our gratitude.\n\n**Memorial of Gratitude for the Bestowal of Rank at the Golden Palace**\n\nYour servant [Name] humbly received the imperial decree on the first day of the third month, appointing me as the Nine Heavens Golden Palace Illuminated Dao and Virtuous Great Immortal, Manifest Spirit, and Universal Savior Zhenren, charged with overseeing the Upper Clarity Heavenly Texts Academy and all matters therein. Gazing toward the Golden Palace, we receive the imperial mandate—our new title inscribed upon the cinnabar terrace, our place secured among the immortal ranks. The radiance of this favor is profound, our awe and trepidation all the greater.\n\nWe, in awe and trepidation, bow our heads again and again. We reverently consider the Supreme Jade Clarity Palace, where all is carefree and joyous. Beyond lies the Mysterious True Realm, luminous and resplendent. Its symbols shine like the double halos of sun and moon, its auspicious signs weave through the five-colored mists. The myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms gather in attendance. Dragons and tigers array to the left and right, phoenixes and simurghs sing before and behind. This is the celestial realm’s delight—how could one of lowly station ever hear of it?\n\nThrough the revolutions of kalpas and the turning of the wheel, we awaken to the necessity of cultivating fasting and practicing the Dao, aspiring to attain sagehood and achieve perfection. We reflect that spirits are vast and unfathomable, while we dwell in the turbid world, rushing about. Sacrificing animals in worship, we know only the schemes of flesh-eaters.\n\nThe millet and sorghum are not fragrant; I humbly accept my place among those who partake of plain meals, clinging only to grass and trees. I have achieved no merit near or far, yet mistakenly received undeserved favor out of turn, belonging still to the ranks of witless spirits. From the Purple Tenuity Palace, the imperial edict is proclaimed; the Emperor’s Seat descends to the palace balcony. Its light approaches the Seven Stars, illuminating all within nine thousand li. My rank equals that of the constellations—numbering one hundred eighteen in all—overseeing the distribution of emoluments at the Three Terraces and assisting the Literary Prosperity in the Six Ministries. When virtue gathers, worthy men rejoice in assembly; when the Dipper overturns, the year’s grains yield abundance. The Old Man appears at the center of the Southern Culmen, below harmonizing with the Auspicious Staircase’s sign—all by the Emperor’s power, what merit is mine?\n\nThis is only because I have encountered the August Heavenly Jade Emperor beneath the Jade Steps. His great virtue is called \"life,\" lofty and supreme; though without sound or scent, he is indeed possessed of form and image. With drums and banners, he once vowed to deliver humanity; holding the tally and wielding the calendar, he alone opened the origin of embodying the Dao. The cinnabar script revealed the essence of warmth and governance, while the green characters presented the auspicious omens of the Milky Way. Thunder issues decrees, the celestial river becomes his decree. Majestic is his descending might; he entrusts me with the selection of the Cultured Right. I, your servant, ascend the hall with sword and shoes, rejoicing in the worthy’s attainment, as the gowned and hatted come to court. I emulate the feudal lords’ offering of jade, deeply favored by grace, diligent in my duties.\n\nI cannot contain my awe as I gaze upon the heavens and long for the sagely presence, overwhelmed with reverence. Humbly I present this memorial in gratitude.\n\n**Memorial of Thanks for Accepting Office at the Jade Tower**\n\nI, your servant, respectfully received on the first day of the third month the decree appointing me as the Nine Heavens Jade Tower Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Dao Supreme Immortal, Illustrious and Vastly Beneficent Perfected One, to govern all courts of the Lower Realm’s Earthly Prison and act with full authority. I prostrate myself before the solemn Jade Tower, bowing near the celestial steps; the golden script bestows honor, specially ennobling my appointment in the Earthly Prison. Overwhelmed by this private favor, I know not how to respond. Reverently I take my place, traversing countless millions of li. Uniting the Four Seas in shared custom, the twenty-eight lunar lodges encircle the heavens; corresponding to the Nine Provinces’ divisions, the three thousand worlds and all sentient beings are subject to the illumination of stars, sun, and moon. Whether forests, trees, mountains, or rivers—high or low—all are human: truly, how joyous!\n\nI pray to open the purple sunlit cloud-brocade satchel and attain deliverance within the Jade Chamber’s cinnabar terrace. Though the Most High does not lightly bestow, I am fortunate that this humble servant may partake in hearing it. Day and night I press on, my spirit ever facing the divine. Reflecting, I am no ghost concealing myself but rely on others to act upon my thoughts. Though I wish to fulfill the heart of fasting and serving the Emperor, I remain subject to the reproach of gluttony and worthlessness. My fields are barren stone, my worldly ties unsevered. Mistakenly I have received the honor of imperial edicts and elegant decrees, specially entrusted with the people’s welfare. I exhort goodness and punish evil, penalize transgressions and reward merit. The virtuous have their names recorded in the Southern Palace; the guilty have their souls confined in the Northern Bureau. I oversee the immortal registers of the Three Isles’ sacred mountains and govern the true administrations of the Five Peaks and Four Continents.\n\nReverently I receive this solemn charge, trembling with awe. The flying squirrel must measure its strength; even the great turtle cannot bear such grace. This is only because I have encountered the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven. The myriad forms flow into being, his favor reaches the utmost. He commands the transformations of yin’s gloom and yang’s ease, the powers of spring’s birth and autumn’s harvest. The Emperor’s chariot soars, the stars array in guard. The Dark Capital stretches boundlessly, adorned with the seven treasures. Auspiciousness unfolds in the azure vault’s hymns; I look up to praise the Jade Emperor’s august title. Repeatedly I have received his gracious commands, surpassing my peers. Ashamed of my lack of merit, I have been elevated—my body cleansed, my sincerity already expressed in offerings of pondweed and water plants. In divining harvests and praying for the year, there is the joy of millet, sorghum, rice, and grains. Below, I fulfill the people’s wishes; above, I answer the heavens’ intent.\n\nI cannot contain my gratitude for this grace, overwhelmed with reverence. Humbly I present this memorial in gratitude, performing the rites with reverent words.\n\n**Memorial to the Heavenly Master**\n\nIt seems your virtue has long sheltered the southern Min, while I gaze toward the northern palace, once more beholding the sun and moon’s light. The imperial decree’s favor descends, and I blush in self-reproach. I am truly fearful and awestruck, bowing my head again and again.\n\nI have heard that Mount Ci once manifested its form at the river’s edge, receiving the great emperor’s enfeoffment in the catalpa shrine. Reverently it descended its brush upon Min and E, extravagantly celebrating the Primordial Emperor’s praise. Through filial piety and sincerity, heroic deeds attain the Dao; through woodcutting and smelting, compassionate aid achieves success. If not for vowing to deliver humanity, how could one transcend the mundane and enter sageliness? Such things exist—how could they be mere chance?\n\nTurning to my own conduct, only the Dao is great. Since the Great Ultimate’s division, there have been the people and the altars of state. By the end of the five kalpas, who shall uphold the guiding principles? This is only because I have encountered the Orthodox Unity, Tranquil Response, Divine Transformation, Manifest Assistance Perfected Lord. When the heart can respond with tranquility and attain the Dao, silently merging with the divine and transforming, it is effortless non-action; when manifesting assistance, it is as if abundantly present. His aspiration is to aid the state and pacify the people; his heart is to establish teachings and set forth regulations. Purple characters and golden names mark the registers of medicinal pearls; jade seals and vermilion tallies translate the phoenix-script texts. The Dao’s law precedes heaven, its learning transmitted to later ages. The hundred spirits guard it; the myriad things revere it. The Great Mystery’s fifteen govern the world from Ghost Valley; the Supreme Yang’s First Administration corresponds to the Horn Star. His numinosity shines through antiquity, his deeds recorded in historical transmissions—beyond the contemplation of one such as I. This is why the Master’s Dao is uniquely revered.\n\nReflecting, I, your servant, rely on others to act, clinging only to the divine. I am akin to rotting grass, a decaying tree without pattern. My stele inscriptions are doubly shamed by Lord Liu; my posthumous name barely survives in Jin history. I cannot distinguish medicine from stone, much less know of Ma Fu or Niu Sou; my furnace and tripod are incomplete—how could I recognize dragon lead or tiger mercury? Though I possess the will to save things, I initially lack the talent to order the world. In divining like Junping and practicing auspicious arts, I merely instruct in loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness, following the teachings of Confucius.\n\nStill, critics admonish me—marvels, powers, and spirits disrupt the Dao, and by these I scheme. Unaware of what I emulate, I have long called such reckless acts a sin from which no earth affords escape. Who could have foreseen that undeserved grace would fall from heaven, that honors would elevate my rank, that I would ascend the immortal ranks, receiving this as if it were my due? To gain it truly startles me. Adrift on the sea of the great leviathan, my spirit flees and my soul trembles; bearing the mountain of the giant turtle, my virtue swells with profound favor. Since assuming office, I have remained as cautious as at first. Upholding the rites of repentance and admonition, I know my own recklessness and fail to grasp the essence of scriptural teachings—yet I still hope for enlightenment. All this stems from my master’s transmission; how dare I claim it as my own achievement? I revere the sagely transformation and proclaim the winds of benevolence. Above, I pray for the sovereign’s longevity, echoing the triple invocation of Mount Song; below, I ensure my people receive the blessings of the *Ji Chou*, as the talismanic transmissions foretell. May sons beget grandsons, and grandsons beget sons in unbroken succession. Though the rites of pepper and orchid may lapse, only the Dao resides in the heart, and the heart is the Dao. Even dogs and horses know to love their master—how could ants and crickets fail to convey their devotion? My heart brims with longing for grace, to the point of trembling awe.\n\nI, your servant, now submit this memorial in gratitude.\n\n**Memorial of Gratitude to the Heavenly Master and True Lord for Appointment**\n\nI have heard that the Dao’s vastness is called greatness, beginning in emptiness, tranquility, and non-action. The spirit attains oneness and becomes numinous, discerning advance and retreat, life and death, without losing its correctness. When its emanations all strike true, who enables this? Is it not the karmic thread of past good fortune, allowing one to seize the moment and awaken?\n\nI, your servant, offer my thanks: I observe that the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Aid Perfected One is upright in humanity and enlightened in divinity. Not merely scheming for sealed\n\n**Memorial of Congratulation to the Sacred Father, Prince Qi, the Loyal and Martial Perfected One**\n\nWith reverence, we reflect upon Your Highness, the Sacred Father, Prince Qi, the Loyal and Martial Perfected One: repaying the state with loyalty, establishing merit through martial prowess. Selecting households for enfeoffment, you have long received the favor of the jade tablet’s grace. Issuing royal decrees, you once unsealed the golden casket’s writ. Your might shook the Huai and Yangtze, your blessings descended upon the garrisoned commanderies. Yesterday, the offering of winter-blooming camellia brought forth purple qi that filled the court; today, the auspicious omen of the blue arrow’s light illumined the chamber. We, your humble servants, though unworthy to stand in your shadow, have yet to fully bask in your boundless grace. Gazing toward the northern palace, we pour forth our devotion; pointing to the southern mountains, we pray for your longevity. We further hope that in the hall’s joyous feasting, all may nurture hearts of familial harmony; that within the four borders, peace may reign, and everywhere, the divine hemp’s shelter be enjoyed. We present this memorial in congratulation.\n\nMoreover, as the new year begins in harmony, its auspiciousness is confirmed by the dawning day. The Nine Heavens resound with celebration, and all rejoice together in the praise of the divine. Auspicious qi drifts like clouds, while joyful voices thunder like thunder. I, your servant, in awe and trepidation, bow my head again and again to offer congratulations.\n\nWith reverence, we reflect upon Your Highness, the Sacred Father, Prince Qi, the Loyal and Martial Perfected One: your nature is upright and just, your rule both martial and civil. Once, your name was heard beyond the Yangtze; now, your deeds flourish in the heart of Min. The four directions’ worthies gather like crowns and tiaras; the radiance of sun and moon is doubled. For a thousand ages, incense and lamps endure, as eternal as heaven and earth. We bow our heads in homage, emulating the reverence of Zhao Hu; we raise our cups in toast, following the example of Ni Kuan. Thus, we practice the rustic rites and extend the village feast. There are those of high and low station, elders and youths—none dare transgress. They seek longevity, wealth, ease, and peace, each according to their prayers. We humbly present this memorial in congratulation.\n\nI, your servant, in utmost joy and exultation, bow my head again and again. My heart brims with fervent devotion, earnest and unwavering.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial from the Southern Palace on Behalf of a Man Seeking Peace and Well-Being**\n\nI have heard that the great Dao is without action—who can fathom the myriad mysteries of its profound profundity? Those who receive its deliverance may hope to endure through kalpas without end. Such truths are not for ordinary mortals to hear; only the virtuous are blessed with its fortune.\n\nI observe that so-and-so conducts himself with frugality and humility, his nature upright and gentle. Yet, by an ill-fated alignment of the stars, he has suffered the afflictions of *Shichen*’s malevolence. Through earnest supplication, he has at last found relief from his ailments. Now, in the year of his sixtieth cycle, he encounters his natal day, though his appearance—his hair thinned, his vigor diminished—no longer matches his former self. Though aged and feeble, he is fortunate that the luminous Perfected One has granted him favor. The scriptures revealed from the Jade Bureau offer nothing but texts to dispel misfortune; the teachings expounded upon the Millet Pearl are all canons to deliver humanity. Such merits and virtues may serve as a bridge to salvation.\n\nI, your servant, though unworthy among the Dao’s followers and presumptuous in performing ritual affairs, have contributed not even a fraction of the primordial work’s merit. How dare I repeatedly present my foolish petitions? With reverence, we reflect upon the Sacred Throne of the Southern Palace’s August Emperor: your benevolence is vast and your mercy boundless, your merits untainted by fault. You govern the nine yang’s mysteries, your Sanskrit vows forming the three caverns’ numinous power. The literary tablets record the embryos and forms of all beings; once endowed with shape and visage, you surely safeguard their lives, cherish their spirits, and ensure that the root of the numinous is watered, its branches flourishing and leaves abundant. You cause the primordial fluid to congeal and solidify, its source deep and its flow far-reaching. Let neither joy nor anger, nor pleasure’s excess, disturb our nature; let neither right nor wrong, nor gain nor loss, confuse our hearts.\n\nAscending to the Supreme Mystery, severing all perverse obstructions.\nInscribing names on cinnabar tablets, recording words in azure scriptures.\nAbove, we trace the grace of the Great Unity; below, we console the hopes of the people.\nWe humbly pray that white may reverse to black, outwardly transmitting the formula of agelessness;\nThat qi may turn from purple to embrace yellow, inwardly attaining the secret of eternal life.\nFurther, we hope that all households flourish in prosperity, their descendants thriving in abundance.\nAlso, on behalf of women engaging in preemptive cultivation—\n\nWe reverently consider: *The Scripture of the Yellow Court*, a single classic, emerged from the Fusang Palace, where we beseech to hear the Lady Wei’s expositions.\nThe three volumes of numinous writ descended upon the Cheng Hua Hall, joyfully receiving the Queen Mother of the West’s direct transmission.\nThese may extend our years and serve to establish teachings and regulations.\n\nWe reflect that though this servant has reached the age of sixty, my learning remains unworthy of mention. Unaware of the li and kan within myself, how can I fathom the great transformations of Heaven and Earth?\nYet, by the grace of the true shade, I have concealed myself in the mysteries of the Daoist codes. With deeper consideration, I recall the female disciple [Name], who, with her five-leaky body, dwells in the mundane world, merely indulging in frivolous laughter, nearly reducing goodness to ruin.\nHer merit, appearance, speech, and virtue—none of the four teachings are complete.\nJoy and anger, a single morning’s pleasure, the six emotions all encumbered.\n\nIn the year of *jihai*, coinciding with the seventh evening’s beginning,\nThe *gengshen* rites are recorded, yet I still fear the lurking Three Corpses.\nReverently facing the heavens, I submit this plea in proxy,\nResolving from this day forth to renew myself.\nMay the crown of my head become the cause of blessings,\nAnd may I humbly beseech unseen assistance.\n\nI reverently consider the August Emperor of Southern Florescence of Nanchang,\nThe Great Emperor of Longevity of the Southern Pole,\nAnd the Life-Cherishing Lord Han, the Venerable Man—\nTheir transformative radiance manifests in the Eight Luminaries,\nTheir Dao pervades the Three Spirits.\nTen recitations of scripture deliver humankind;\nNine Yangs are refined into qi.\nVast and majestic their model,\nSerene and boundless their origin.\n\nI implore the Three Realms to descend as one,\nTo record your merits and erase your transgressions.\nMay the multitude of perfected ones be indiscriminately delivered,\nPreserving your life and honoring your form,\nEnabling you to endure through kalpas and abide long.\nDaring to seize this moment of awakening,\nI gaze toward the northern palace in hope of grace,\nThat my name be inscribed in the southern archives,\nReceiving the texts of yellow threads and white tablets,\nEtched in purple characters and golden names.\nMay your years be prolonged,\nEight thousand seasons turning as spring and autumn.\nBestow upon me boundless favor,\nA hundred generations flourishing with descendants.\nAbove, embody the Supreme’s virtue of cherishing life;\nBelow, regard this servant’s earnest entreaty.\n\nGratitude to the master for recommending the completion of merit for the departed.\nI have heard with joy of the *Western Ascension*,\nTransmitted by Lord Lao,\nAnd of the covenant rites receiving the *Yellow Emperor’s Questions on the Yin Talisman*,\nExpounded by Guangchengzi.\nFaithfully received and reverently practiced.\nWere it not for karmic predestination,\nHow could one possess the bone-form of an immortal?\n\nThis servant, trembling with awe,\nBows his head again and again.\nI reflect that my canine-and-horse years have reached eighty;\nThough now aged, I remain capable of one final endeavor.\nThe dragon-and-phoenix scriptures—I have studied but two or three.\nYet even a fool, it is said, may achieve insight through a thousand considerations.\nSince assuming this office,\nI have guarded the Dao with strictness.\nHow can I discipline others\nWithout first demanding it of myself?\nTalent must be tested:\nThose with merit are rewarded,\nThose with transgressions are punished.\nThus may all act with sincerity in virtue,\nAnd prudence in speech.\n\nI reverently consider the Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity, Tranquil Response, and Manifest Protection—\nHis dharma transmitted as Orthodox Unity,\nHis Dao penetrating the subtle mysteries.\nFor ten thousand generations, he is the teacher of rulers,\nThe parent of all living beings.\nHe establishes teachings and regulations,\nThe Great Dharma Master of All Heavens,\nPointing the way to salvation and deliverance,\nRescuing the suffering and liberating the departed,\nAwakening the vow of compassion.\n\nYet I fear that the spirits thus recommended,\nAdrift in the turbid currents of fleeting life,\nMay have unwittingly committed errors.\nIn the endless night’s darkness,\nWho recognizes the marvel of emerging from existence and entering non-existence?\nOnly through merit may this serve as a bridge.\n\nI humbly pray that the Great Dao illuminate,\nThe earth be purged of demonic vapors,\nThe heavens free of drifting haze,\nSoul and spirit purified and rectified.\nLet the smoke-choked gates of death open,\nThe clouds part to reveal the gates of life.\nMay even the darkest yin realms\nAll receive the mysterious grace.\n\n**Refinement and Deliverance Memorial**\n\nI prostrate myself, for at the center of the Azure Heaven,\nThe *Scripture of Deliverance* is proclaimed.\nAfter the kalpa of the August Emperor,\nThe *Stanzas of the Divine Generative Spirit* were covenanted.\nAs the great cycle nears its term,\nThe sacred texts emerge.\n\nThis servant, trembling with fear,\nReflects that my heart remains enslaved to things,\nMy body not yet merged with the true.\nI have not heard of the tortoise-breathing method,\nAnd deeply shame at my crane-hair and dragon-decrepitude.\nYet I lead the prayers with utmost sincerity,\nStriving to practice diligently.\n\nI fear that the departed spirits thus recommended,\nSunk in the dust of worldly illusion,\nEntangled in emotional attachments,\nMay have unwittingly committed errors of thought, word, or intent.\nReturning to the root and restoring the origin—\nWho recognizes the marvel of essence, qi, and spirit?\nSelf-inflicted is the ruin of death;\nWho knows the path to life?\n\nI reverently consider the Great Emperor of the Divine Generative Spirit of the Nine Heavens—\nHis Dao pervades the Three Spirits,\nHis transformative power flows through the Two Luminaries.\nIn the East, he is known as the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful.\nIn Nanchang, he oversees the bureaus of Deliverance and Refinement.\nYin becomes po, yang becomes hun—\nOnly through yin and yang are they tempered.\nFire pertains to the heart, water to the kidneys—\nWithout water and fire, how could life be formed?\n\nI implore the Great Creation to embrace all,\nThe true light to illumine thoroughly,\nThat the foul and putrid be utterly dissolved,\nThe withered and decayed, upon hearing, emit smoke.\nMay bones and flesh take flight together,\nForm and spirit be made whole.\nInner thoughts not stray outward,\nOuter thoughts not intrude within,\nForever cutting off the source of afflictions.\nOnce the register of qi is established,\nAnd the qi of compliance is born,\nA body of empty cavernousness emerges.\nMay all suffering souls\nBathe in this vast grace.\n\nMoreover, the *Scripture of Deliverance*,\nRecited ten times, revives withered bones.\nThe *Stanzas of the Divine Generative Spirit*,\nComprising nine chapters, liberates dark souls.\nThe Supreme attained this\nTo establish teachings and regulations.\nLater students rely on it\nTo rescue the suffering and deliver the departed.\n\nI reverently consider the sacred ranks—\nSeven epochs aligned,\nThree Spirits conjoined,\nAbove embodying the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth.\nYin employs the even, yang the odd;\nWithin, the work of *li* and *kan* is illuminated.\nWater seeks the damp, fire the dry.\nA bridge for the multitude of sufferings,\nA sun and moon for the lost multitudes.\nMy vows are profound,\nMy merit boundless.\n\nI reflect that in recent years, old and senile,\nMy studies have grown neglected.\nTiger mercury and dragon lead—\nI have not mastered the ninefold transmutations and completions.\nBear postures and tortoise breathing—\nI know not the method of one inhalation and one exhalation.\nYet when I previously received the memorial,\nI fulfilled my allotted duty.\nNow, witnessing the filial devotion’s sincerity,\nI reluctantly undertake the rites to preside over them.\n\nI deeply consider the departed souls thus recommended—\nYesterday they possessed living bodies,\nToday they enter the register of the dead.\nBelow, their hun and po are summoned,\nLong wandering in the springs’ curves.\nKnocking on skulls,\nThey have only recently found the joy of returning to their native mounds.\nWithout undergoing the refining furnace,\nHow can they transcend the ordinary?\n\nI implore the Three Realms to descend as one,\nThe multitude of perfected ones to descend,\nTo deliver the dead souls for refinement,\nEnabling them to transform into immortals.\nMerging marvelously, dissolving forms,\nTheir kind dispersed across kalpas\nReturn to the One.\nThey must rely on the power of ascending the primordial,\nEncountering the work of Brahma.\n\nMoreover, in the Azure Vault of Floating Li,\nThe ten recitations of the *Scripture of Deliverance* are expounded.\nFrom the Jade Terrace of Primordial Yang,\nThe nine stanzas of the *Divine Generative Spirit* emerge.\nSince the transmission of these teachings,\nThrough successive masters and disciples.\n\nI reflect that this servant, humbly among later students,\nHas inherited the governance of the mysterious codes.\nYet I do not understand *li* and *kan* within myself,\nNor comprehend the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth.\nStill, I lead the prayers with utmost sincerity,\nStriving to practice diligently.\n\nDeeply I fear that the departed souls,\nmisled between past lives and deaths to come,\nmay have erred in their ways.\nSome, succumbing to incurable ulcers,\nare deemed to suffer karmic retribution—\nyet where does the *po* soul wander?\nWho guards the *hun* and sustains the *po*?\nThe form is no longer theirs—\nwho can refine the substance and temper the body?\nWithout the aid of incense and cultivation,\nby what means can they transcend?\n\nI reverently recall the sacred ranks:\nempty and formless, they transform naturally.\nThey perceive the radiance of the Eight Luminaries,\nand silently align with the Seven Mysteries in reverence.\nThe deliverance of the netherworld weighs heavily upon my vows.\nI humbly beseech:\nsummon them through yin, call them through yang,\nthat the dead souls may undergo refinement.\nDisperse them with wind, moisten them with rain,\nthat withered bones may be revived.\n\nMoreover,\nthe Most High has bequeathed scriptures for the deliverance of souls,\nwhile I, a minor official of scattered duties,\npossess no talent for memorializing.\nBound by my station, what can I say?\nOverwhelmed, I dare not falter.\nI offer my gratitude, reverently recalling the sacred ranks:\nthey uphold Heaven’s ordinances, embody the Emperor’s radiance.\nThough they seem distant and obscure,\nwho knows their ceaseless transformations?\nThose who receive *qi* return to the bellows and bellows-bag;\nthose endowed with form emerge from the potter’s mold.\nBreathing life into the withered, exhaling upon the decayed,\nthey silently master the wonders of yin and yang.\nAbove, they blaze; below, they moisten—\nlooking up, I fathom the workings of water and fire.\nThe formless can manifest in form;\nthe true sovereign acts without sovereign intent.\nTheir luminous, mighty deeds\ndeliver boundless beings.\n\nI reflect upon the patron of this rite, a certain woman of this day,\nwhose heart aches with grief, tears flowing from her sorrow,\nas she mourns her daughter’s untimely death.\nBefore eight days had passed, she was struck by her husband’s demise,\nparting forever beneath the heavens.\nThis sorrow, this love—\nnowhere to express, nowhere to plead.\nI trust that King Wen’s grace\ncan extend even to withered bones.\nYet I, a mere alchemist, am ashamed—\nmy learning falls short of the divine elixir’s mysteries.\nStill, following the guidance of the enlightened present,\nthe true souls may yet be delivered.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven perfects the male;\nthe Dao of Earth perfects the female.\nTrace their origins, befriend their ends.\nMoonlight becomes the *po*;\nsunlight becomes the *hun*.\nThey inscribe your life, erase your death.\n\n**Memorial for Redemption of Sins**\n\nRank is not to be profaned;\npunishment is not to be trifled with.\nAll covet rank—\nwhy then do they not fear punishment?\nMerit is weighty;\nsin is light.\nWho examines merit to redeem sin?\nAll is self-inflicted.\nIf one acts in ignorance,\nwere it not for the Most High’s love of life,\nthe people would perish utterly.\nThus, the purple clouds of dawn unfurl,\nand the pearl of millet is hung aloft,\ngranting absolution for transgressions,\nrescuing the departed from suffering.\nThe tally is struck, amnesty proclaimed,\nthat the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus\nmay inspect the ghostly camps and expound the law.\nHearing the scriptures, countless spirits ascend,\nand ten thousand ancestors take flight.\nBy this merit, the Golden Towers stand;\nvirtue becomes the bridge.\n\nI reflect that I, with decayed teeth and hoary head,\nam a pitiable, doddering figure.\nLow in rank and humble in duty,\nI am as clumsy as a lame horse.\nYet, charged with this office, I must speak and present my case.\nLike a rat stirring at night,\nI fear only being seen—\ngreat shame would be my disgrace.\nI would fall in terror, saved only by heaven’s grace.\nI humbly beseech that my loyal sincerity be seen,\nand the weight of a filial child’s devotion be recognized.\nToday, I act on behalf of a grieving daughter, so-and-so,\nwho mourns her late father, so-and-so.\nSince his self-inflicted death,\nthree years have passed,\nand though she has long wished to perform rites,\nher hopes remain unfulfilled.\n\nI observe that the departed soul,\nsuccumbing to an incurable ulcer,\nwas ultimately misled by the Two Fiends.\nHis heart was not deceitful—\nwhy then was he drawn toward the Three Corpses?\nSincere words stirred, yet\nit was said his hidden yin virtue was lacking.\nThus, he fell into the netherworld,\nunable to awaken or understand.\nAlas, the barrier between the living and the dead—\nnot something ears or eyes can perceive.\nIn the depths of prison,\neven Gongye Chang was innocent.\nTo suffer as Dong Zhongshu did,\nor endure the humiliation of Sima Qian—\nwas there no regret?\n\nI, who have presumptuously taken office in the yang realm,\nknow nothing of yin’s laws.\nTo cleanse others,\nI must first confront my own fears.\nMy voice, like thunder’s echo,\nis but the caw of a crow that thinks itself loud.\nGazing to the ends of rivers and seas,\nam I not like a fish that has slipped the net?\nThe Lü Clan once scrutinized the Five Punishments and Five Penalties,\nwhile the *Rites of Zhou* spoke of Three Pardons and Three Amnesties.\nLacking Mulan’s filial piety,\nhow dare I presume to present a petition like Lady Tiying’s?\nLike a moth drawn to flame,\nwhere can I find refuge?\nLike a stray dog without a home,\nmy plight is truly pitiable.\n\nI reverently recall the sacred ranks:\nthey vow compassion,\nresponding to cries and answering pleas,\nhonored as the Most Unique of the Great One.\nTheir light shines universally across the Three Thousand Worlds,\nto the easternmost reaches.\nIn the Wondrous and Solemn Palace,\nthey manifest in purple-golden form.\nThe Great Mystery knows no bounds—\nI have heard of the *Scripture of the Great Cavern*.\nWishing to be a bridge for all beings,\nthey rescue from every suffering.\n\nI humbly beseech:\nswiftly erase the ledgers of sin,\nand relocate his spirit to the Northern Mansion.\nSelect from the ranks of immortals,\nand inscribe his name in the Southern Palace.\nLet the winds of immortals carry his merit—\nthus concludes the ninth scroll of *Xu Xian’s Elegant Writings*.\nThe tenth scroll of *Xu Xian’s Elegant Writings* begins.\n\nFour Prayers for Peace\n\nIn this second month of mid-spring, all people pray for renewal, and the August Heavenly Lord does not forsake us. With a single heart we may reach the divine; our shared plea ascends, piercing the ninefold heavens.\n\nWe, the lowly, cling to life like ants and grubs, yet know gratitude. Though we dwell beneath the vast canopy of heaven and earth, our days pass in restless haste, untouched by the burdens of right and wrong. Searching our hearts, we find few who recognize their faults; reviewing our deeds, we see many who have wrought harm. Ever mindful of our fears, we dare rely on the power of this single offering.\n\nMay the gods above and below witness our virtue and guide us left and right. May farmers, artisans, merchants, and scholars rejoice in their livelihoods—thus shall they prosper.\n\n---\n\nThe common people, ignorant, often invoke blessings through borrowed spirits. Yet the Heavenly Lord watches over you, without partiality in rewarding merit or punishing wrong. If He does not deceive us, aid will come to those who act in accord with the Way.\n\nWe, the humble, dwell by the mountains, hewing homes from stone and carving fields from slopes. As the stars of the Crow and the Winnowing Basket appear in mid-spring, we begin our labors in earnest. The barking of dogs carries across the four borders, and we long for the Great Stem. Knowing the hardship of earning our sustenance, we dare not withhold our sincerity in offering thanks.\n\nThough we are frogs at the bottom of a well, unable to grasp the vastness of the world, even ants clinging to a cauldron deserve pity for their lives. May planting and weeding, from this day forward, yield harvests year after year. May peace and wealth—desires of all hearts—be granted by Heaven. Further, we pray for the flourishing of our cattle and livestock, truly bearing the weight of your boundless grace and nurturing care.\n\n---\n\nThe will of the people is plain to see: their gaze and hearing are near, for they are the people themselves.\n\nThe Emperor’s command cannot be defied; with fasting and purification, we may offer sacrifice to the Emperor. Earnest in our pleas, we stand as though in the presence of His radiant majesty. We humbly reflect that we, like ants clinging to a cauldron or frogs at the bottom of a well, are greedy and shallow. Born in the Central Land, we have yet to fulfill our duties to our satisfaction. Now, as the Upper Prime arrives, we still hope for the blessings of the Heavenly Officials. Thus, we rely upon the Daoist adept to proclaim the true rites, reaching upward to the stern judgment of the axe and iron, and downward to the ears of even the lowliest creatures. Though the present may not know the past, we are fortunate that even impure customs may be renewed.\n\nWe pray that those like the Earl of Shen and the Marquis of Fu may rise again, and that those who follow may attain the longevity of Peng and the wealth of Tao, assuredly receiving such blessings. In all our movements and undertakings, we are truly indebted to the virtue of creation and nurture.\n\n---\n\nIn this sixtieth year, on the day of my birth:\nThe Dao ever favors the good, and one must understand the causes of goodness. Our desire for peace has been fulfilled, and our wish for tranquility granted. Respectfully relying upon the Daoist adept, we present these written prayers. We humbly reflect that though my words are unworthy, I have now reached the age of ear-turning. Once afflicted with the ailment of gathering firewood, I now enjoy the blessing of recovery without medicine. Moreover, as the tenth month arrives, I mark my birth once more. Truly, I am indebted to the decree of Heaven and dare not betray my former vows. I pray that my later years may be prosperous and smooth, offering my sincere heart in gratitude. The merit of this act may be measured, and my reverence is as solemn as the fear of the tiger. May my ancestors rest in peace, their memory honored without fail. Looking upward, I seek divine aid; bowing downward, I beg for confirmation.\n\n---\n\n**Thanksgiving Prayer by a Woman for Preemptive Merit**\nRites, when overly elaborate, lead to disorder; only utmost sincerity can move the gods. Heaven guides the heart, and the accumulation of good deeds brings abundant blessings. Looking upward, we beseech the celestial hearing; bowing downward, we reveal our tender sentiments. We humbly reflect that I, your servant, lack the Four Virtues and that my many words are of little benefit. My learning is as unclear as the misreading of \"three pigs,\" and now I approach the years beyond sixty, nearing seventy. My voice is as insignificant as a single fly, yet I fear repeating past mistakes. Removing my hairpin in submission, I gather my robes and present these words, repenting for past transgressions and cultivating future blessings. Further, I pray that my descendants, countless generations hence, may be enrolled in the register of Han Jun. May the Three Longevities be my companions, and may I receive the ode of Lu Hou.\n\n---\n\n**Preemptive Prayer by a Woman for the Yellow Register and Celestial Decree**\nHuman nature may incline toward good or evil, and even a foolish woman may comprehend this. Our desires for longevity and peace are met with Heaven’s favor, which brings only auspiciousness. Bowing low, I offer my enduring reverence; looking upward, I dare to disturb Your majestic countenance. We humbly reflect that I, your wife, am entangled in the desires of the world and submerged in the dust of the mundane. The five defilements of form and sound have surely brought their share of offenses. Though my hair is half-gray, I am fortunate to have reached the year of my birth once more. Overwhelmed and at a loss, I can only repent and give thanks inadequately. Respectfully, on the second day of the second month, I reverently partake in the rites of the Three Realms’ covenant with the true, dedicating the fruits of my merit in hope of Your grace. May this offering extend to my lord, deepening the love that binds us. May my later years be brightened, and may I further seek the joy of playful delight.\n\n---\n\n**Ritual Prayer for Thanksgiving**\nAs the year marks my sixtieth cycle, I find myself at this appointed time. My emotions struggle to reach the heavens, and I cannot avoid repeating my pleas. Rites must not be neglected, and words are spoken when the time is right. We humbly reflect that I, old and feeble, am without ability, confused and unenlightened. Recently afflicted with the lowly ailments of horses and cattle, I cried out to Heaven in desperation. Now, clinging to life like an ant, how can I not be moved by the earth’s compassion? Though my good intentions have taken shape in words, I am fortunate that the radiant gods may perceive my heart. Bowing low, I express my private gratitude; looking upward, I dare to disturb Your exalted hearing. As merit is fulfilled, may my name be inscribed in the golden register and white tally. May I be granted the blessings of abundance, longevity, health, and peace, as bestowed by the *Hong Fan* and *Ji Chou*. Further, I pray that my descendants may bring glory to their forebears.\n\n---\n\n**Prayer for the Ancestral Mother’s Protection**\nTo know gratitude is to know repayment; the August Heaven and Earth indeed hear our solemn words. To serve the dead as we serve the living is the duty of filial sons and obedient grandsons. Thus, we rely upon this pure rite, presumptuously beseeching the true banner. We humbly reflect that I was orphaned at four and received instruction through three relocations. In the past, through my grandmother, I suffered from an incurable blindness; my late father was deeply grieved by my drowning, yet could not save me. Though I repeatedly prayed to the gods, why did misfortune still befall me? Unfortunate in my short life, I wept as I recounted my unfulfilled vows, knowing not how to proceed. Fortunately, over the years, I have come to terms with my fate, easing my heart and freeing it from its initial burdens. The departed flow like this river, and may they soon align with Han Jun’s compassionate work. In the end, may there be care, and may the ode of Lu Hou praising a mother’s longevity be sung.\n\n---\n\n**Prayer for a Wife**\nWhen illness strikes, one calls to Heaven, for there is no other recourse. If dreams bring harm, we seek to understand their cause. Bowing low, I pour forth my sincerity; looking upward, I beseech the celestial hearing. We humbly reflect that I am bound by fate to the Dipper’s middle star, and my affairs are as discordant as Shen and Shang. Lamenting the hardships of my household, why are my family’s fortunes so fraught? Even beasts do not lose their mates—how could I lack the sentiments of the world? Though the bowstring may be rejoined, I cannot avoid new attachments. Despite the ugliness of painted brows and powdered cheeks, why am I afflicted by the misfortune of arrows piercing my chest? Perhaps the love and hate of the reed mat differ, rendering the healing of medicine ineffective. Thus, I have pledged to invoke the True Man of Lingji, proclaiming the repentance of the Nine Truths. I pray that the Most High Lord of the Great Monad may widely bestow His great compassion, releasing me from karmic transgressions and delivering me from suffering. Alas, my former wife—early did she fulfill the cause of the trailing tail. May my descendants be preserved, forever upholding the duty of the silken threads.\n\n---\n\nMoreover:\nHeaven’s brightness is to be revered, for its power is manifest in what is seen and heard—how could it lack ears and eyes?\n\nWhere matters arise from nothingness, oaths and curses invoke the unseen—yet how can one bind the spirits of ghosts and gods? To believe so is folly indeed.\n\nI, so-and-so, reflect in shame: my conduct has strayed from propriety, my ignorance as dull as the crawling of insects. Like a bandit breaching the inner gate, my voice went unheard even by the barking dogs. A wife’s loose tongue, like the clucking of a hen, truly invites scorn. What was taken in the rites must be returned—reason demands self-reproach. Yet if suffering arises from negligence, who would deny the cry of injustice? Rewarding good and punishing excess—swift as echo follows sound. To untie resentment and loosen knots, one may yet find refuge in the rites of repentance.\n\nMoreover:\nHeaven cannot be deceived—its gaze is lofty, its ears ever near. When man’s wrath stirs, it wells from the heart and takes shape in words. How can it be otherwise? One must seek its cause.\n\nI, so-and-so, as a person, now ponder: recalling my late father, he clung to the folly of the waiting tree-stump, never expecting treachery to strike like a stone cast from below. I appealed to the August Emperor to judge right and wrong, and by good fortune, the courts rendered clarity. Ashamed of my clumsy pleas, how dare I betray my sworn vows? Humble and base as I am, I now approach the pure hall to offer rites of apology. My feeble efforts scarcely begin to repay the debt—yet if I delay further, I fear my resolve may waver again.\n\nFlaws may be renewed as the sun and moon recover from eclipse; what use is brightness if it invites the censure of the *Spring and Autumn*'s unflinching brush?\n\n**Establishing the Altar of the Mysterious Capital: Petition**\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the autumn of the *renxu* year, we reverently welcome the Earth Official on the day of his audit and recording.\n\nThe Mandate of Heaven is stern toward the people below. First, we exhaust the rites of purification and luminous reverence, arranging fragrant mats to humbly lodge our modest sincerity.\n\nWe reflect: our blood and *qi* share the same origin as all flesh. Though our departed kin could but offer the devotion of dogs and horses, how dare we forget the gratitude of crows and magpies? Time flows like this river—yet we err in composing these summoning verses. Yet if faults can be dissolved, we have heard it may be done in the space between turning palms.\n\nRespectfully following the Mysterious Code, we solemnly invite the feathered adepts to perform these meritorious deeds and establish this karmic connection.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Three Officials of the Northern Fengdu may scrutinize the ghostly camps and swiftly expunge the ledgers of sin. May our countless ancestors ascend to the Golden Gates, each finding their path to rebirth. May all the lost and deluded together attain joy and liberation.\n\n**Prayer for Averting Disaster**\n\nHarmonious *qi* brings auspiciousness, while discordant *qi* brings anomalies—Heaven’s ways are inscrutable and without constancy. The Way of fortune lengthens as the Yin Way wanes; the return of the sun may be awaited.\n\nWe bow in lowly submission and gaze upward in presumptuous address.\n\nWe reflect: though we have fortunately secured safety, we have failed to maintain it. Though the multitudes petition for disaster-averting rites, we petty folk know the shame of our transgressions. None dares face the sunflower’s devotion; we can but fear the depths of the abyss. How can our village compare? We have but a humble puddle’s worth of reverence.\n\nThus we gather the Daoist clergy to solemnly conduct the ritual. We trust the people’s plight is easily seen and pray the Emperor’s wrath may be turned.\n\nWe humbly beseech that sand be transformed into harmony, sparing us the dread of neglected sacrifices. May we be granted longevity and prosperity, and may abundant blessings descend.\n\n**Prayer for Preserving Fortune**\n\nThe Way of Heaven speaks not, yet responds—we offer our earnest supplications. The human heart’s desires, when sincere, must surely evoke a resonant response.\n\nWe inscribe this in our hearts, knowing our debt is profound.\n\nWe reflect: we, so-and-so, rely solely upon the divine, having no merits to recount. Yet we have been doubly favored by Heaven’s bounty and honored by our master’s grace. Recently, we entrusted Chen Daoxing with the *Dragon-Tiger* rites, and indeed received great protection. Now, with Elder Guo Yong, we fulfill the *Cricket’s* repayment, refusing to renege on our word.\n\nThough this is the people’s hope, how dare we claim any credit for Heaven’s power? We further pray for the bestowal of the *gui zan* scepter, that we may await summons in the Purple Tenuity, and for the offering of fine grains, that the spirits may be at peace in the Pure Temple.\n\n**Establishing the Ritual of Crossing: Petition**\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy expounded the teachings, pointing the way to salvation. For children honoring their parents, the foremost path is filial reverence.\n\nWe bow in earnest address, gazing upward to the azure vault.\n\nWe reflect: we, so-and-so, dwell in the dust. Though we have fortunately lived through the final kalpa, we recall those who bore and raised us, whose nurturing love was as deep as the canopy of heaven. Yet they linger between existence and oblivion—how hateful is the barrier between light and dark! Thus we rely on the feathered adepts to perform the true rites.\n\nToday, we open the Mysterious Altar, seeking to ascend our prayers to the Imperial Palace. May our humble sincerity move the divine, and may great proof be granted.\n\nWords cannot express our joy: the assembled hosts from the ten directions witness the deliverance of the living and the dead. By the grace bestowed upon the nine hundred, all hearts are poured forth. May the lost in the underworld all ascend to the shore of the Dao.\n\n**Moreover,**\n\nThe hearing of Heaven is impartial; may it deign to perceive even a fraction of our foolish sincerity.\n\nHere is the translation, maintaining consistency with the previous section’s style and terminology:\n\n---\n\nWhen rites grow excessive, they breed disorder—how deeply we fear the repeated offense of overburdening the divine, lest we incur fault through our own urgency. Yet there are matters that admit no delay.\n\nWe reflect: though we are but gnats in nature, ants in survival, each possesses a human heart—how could we lack good intentions? Now, as the Zhongyuan Festival approaches, we begin our fast eight days prior, wishing to forge karmic bonds with all beings. Thus we undertake the Nine Mornings’ Universal Deliverance, humbly invoking sacred power and beseeching the bestowal of gracious light. We dare offer our private gratitude, striving to manifest reverence from beginning to end. Further, we pray for the five viscera to be cleansed and cool, the six bowels harmonized and at peace. May the old regain their vigor, the young grow strong. May the Three Realms provide guardianship, the Five Emperors oversee their reception. May the *po* ascend, the *hun* be liberated.\n\nMoreover,\nThough Heaven’s height seems boundless, it never strays from the square inch of the heart. As mortals, we must be vigilant from the outset, ever mindful of the perils of neglecting the fast. Following the Yellow Register’s rites, we draw near to the purple radiance to invoke the sacred. Deeply reliant on the vast creation’s workings, we open wide the path of salvation. May the darkness of the underworld be illuminated, the long night ended, and the light of Yang Valley be beheld—each soul restored to spring.\n\n**Second Morning’s Invocation**\nThe Dao is beyond naming—yet this very Heaven is called the Dao. Through fasting, reverence may be achieved. Pouring forth the sincerity of sunflowers turning to the sun, we beseech that the qi of fragrant herbs may move the divine. We pray for universal deliverance, benefiting both the living and the dead. As the departed flow like this river, may their *hun* return to Heaven, their *po* to Earth. For the living, may nurturance abound—blessings vast as the sea, longevity steadfast as mountains.\n\n**Third Morning’s Invocation**\nIn serving the dead and the living, we fulfill the filial piety due to our honored parents. In revering the end as we revered the beginning, we uphold the solemnity of discipline. Our gratitude ascends to the Nine Heavens; our rites span three days. Completing the Nine Mornings’ Dao, we pray for the illumination of the Eight Luminaries, that our embodied selves may endure. May the names of the departed be inscribed early upon the Cinnabar Terrace’s stone chambers, and their souls find proof of refinement. Through the merit of the Golden Register and White Petitions, may all in darkness and light alike receive deliverance.\n\n**Establishing the Morning Audience**\nHeaven’s hearing is never distant; we ever hold our private sincerity in mind. Yet human affairs must end—how can we avoid repeated supplication? Overwhelmed and ashamed, we, the foolish and ignorant, reflect: fortunate to have attained human form, we are ever favored by the Emperor’s gaze, with abundance to our left and right. Knowing how to serve the dead and the living, we rely on the incense of cultivation to perfect this morning audience. We pray that the Eastern Realm of Eternal Joy and the Western Land of Na may both radiate light; that the Northern Springs’ Winding Palace and the Southern Palace of Shangchang may together achieve universal deliverance. May all sentient beings attain transcendence.\n\n**Dispersing the Morning Audience**\nThe Heavenly Dao defies naming, yet it is wise and luminous. In the order of human relations, filial piety and reverence must come first. We prostrate ourselves, pouring forth our sorrow, lifting our voices to the azure vault. We reflect: dwelling in the Central Land, we share this private devotion. Through the purity of our fast, we fulfill the Way of honoring parents, mindful that though we were nurtured in life, we failed to fully repay their warmth. Alas, the departed flow like this river, and the barrier between light and dark remains. Relying on the merit of this morning audience, we seek to make it a bridge to liberation. May the Emperor’s hearing be moved; may your deeds be recorded, your sins erased, and the people’s sincerity be seen. Extending to the departed, preserving for the living, we pray that all in the underworld may ascend to the shore of the Dao.\n\nMoreover,\nThe Emperor watches over you—let your heart know no duplicity, as if he stood to your left and right. All people possess constancy, cherishing virtue and honoring parents. We pour forth our crimson sincerity, lifting our voices to the vault of Heaven. We reflect: as children, we ever strive to honor our thoughts—yet the departed are gone like this river, while the living have failed to nurture them. Step by step, we prostrate ourselves, gazing toward Mount Tai to offer our devotion. Thrice we bathe, thrice we burn incense, relying on our revered masters to present our petitions. May the realms of light and dark alike receive the grace of deliverance. In the human realm, may the young grow strong, the old regain their vigor. May the dead be refined, their forms established, their spirits preserved. May all in the underworld attain the fruit of the Dharma.\n\n**A Daughter’s Petition for Her Father**\nIn the shadowy night’s prison, we lament the nine hells’ depths of suffering. In the dawn’s courtyard, we later behold the five lights’ brilliance. We prostrate ourselves, pouring forth our sincerity, lifting our voices to the pure. We reflect: our father’s flesh has barely cooled, his voice still lingers—how could we, as children, ever forget the Way of serving parents? Fortunate that the Heavenly Worthy has stirred a heart of salvation, responding to cries for aid. Relying on the power of incense and cultivation, we dare express our private gratitude. We pray that the fifty-three years of floating obstacles and hardships may all be erased, that the hundred thousand *qi* of the formless void may be drawn forth. May all sentient beings attain birth and transformation, ascending together to the Great Dao.\n\nMoreover,\nThe Dao is beyond words—through ten thousand million kalpas, its form defies description. Father, where have you gone? Fifty-three years passed like a fleeting colt. In quiet reflection, who could bear this? We reflect: our father met his end in the dust of this fleeting world. Though his clothing and food were sufficient to ease his brow, and no illness suddenly afflicted him, Heaven is high, Earth distant—who could restore his *po* and summon his *hun*? The moon is cold, frost bitter—who could not weep in sorrow? Relying on this merit, we make it a bridge. Having received deliverance, how could we forget our gratitude? We pray that the Three Officials may swiftly erase his name from the ledgers of sin, uprooting all evil. May the Five Emperors oversee his journey to the Jade Capital, his ascent to the Golden Gates.\n\nMoreover,\nOur father’s kindness remains unrepayed—we rely on the merit of deliverance to turn back the Emperor’s wrath. We pray for the stirring of compassion; having received mercy, who would dare forget the source? We reflect: our sins have accumulated upon our person, extending calamity to our father. Though we harbor private grief, we cannot voice it—we can only pray that the Dharma’s form may uphold us. Having bathed our bodies and refined our forms, we have already presented our petition to the Vermilion Mound. Laying bare our livers and gallbladders, we now inscribe these words in jade.\n\nLonging deepens beyond measure, trembling and at a loss.\n\nWe humbly pray that ears may hear, sounds may resonate, eyes may see, colors may appear—awakening the mechanism of thought, knowledge, understanding, and enlightenment; that hands may move, feet may dance—attaining the joy of unfettered freedom. May all those in hidden suffering thereby ascend beyond.\n\nMoreover,\nAs a woman who has taken her path, I once made a plea for his return to peace. The boundless heavens offer no solace—how can I bear this grief of losing my sole support? Bowing low, I pour forth my foolish heart, lifting my gaze to beseech your august presence.\n\nReflecting, I recall my father’s words were simple, his learning modest. Measured by human affairs, he did no wrong—why then was he forsaken by fate? Six years of confinement left his limbs as though shackled, bringing the twin fiends’ nightmare to his very marrow, or perhaps the Three Corpses’ calamity arose from his torpor. His illness has reached its crisis—who now knows the plan to restore his rest? Here I weep, barely fulfilling the duty of a filial child. Grieving and harboring resentment, I can only lay bare my plea.\n\nFortunately, in the long kalpas to come, the teachings will endure, so that beneath King Yama’s throne, grievances may be unbound and enmities released. Perhaps through wondrous power, a method to revive life may be offered.\n\nWe humbly pray that his marks of excellence may flourish, his karmic bonds from past lives be severed. May all his sins be uprooted, his chronic afflictions and accumulated misfortunes swept away. May he swiftly regain his form and wander the Great Void. May all, in darkness and in light, together attain liberation.\n\nProstrate, I beseech the August Emperor: though He has not absolved, how could one fail to offer reverence with a humble heart? Without a father, what refuge remains? The youngest daughter’s sorrow is unbearable. Bowing low, I pour forth my sincerity; lifting my gaze, I implore the lofty ear of Heaven.\n\nI recall how my father’s untreatable abscess brought him to death, his flesh not yet cold. Perhaps he appeared in a vision of light, his countenance filled with sorrow—who could cast him aside, unmoved? Who would not plead with deepest urgency? Like Ye Chang, though innocent, he suffered the weight of public judgment; like Zeng Shen, falsely accused of murder, he endured suspicion that could not be dispelled. For three years, grief has weighed upon me; for nine springs, resentment has lingered in the Yellow Springs. Had I not served him with utmost devotion, who would deem his deep wrongs redeemable? I humbly pray that the karma of many lives be pardoned, that he not be bound and pressed into the ranks of ghosts. May the enmities of past ages be released, and from this moment of awakening, may all be aided by the power of the Dao.\n\nAgain, prostrate, I reflect: my father’s loss is grievous—how can one endure the sorrow of his death? Though his daughter was wed to a neighbor, she could not fulfill her wish to return and bring him peace. Bowing low, I offer my earnest devotion; lifting my gaze, I disturb the vault of Heaven.\n\nI recall how my father attended to his duties with diligence and managed his household with frugality. Though he had but slightly expanded his fields, he widely extended the intentions of our ancestors. Though his family faced many hardships, he strove to repay the debts of his sons. His kindness remained unrequited, yet my heart holds it deeply. I had hoped that in his later years, he might enjoy good fortune and preserve his life. Yet half his years passed like a bubble’s shadow. After twenty days of illness, the abscess had not yet burst, but his gall had already perished. At the end of four seven-day cycles, his soul might be summoned, but his spirit would not fade. To bow before the Vermilion Mound and cross the threshold of life, one must rely on the Daoist priest to present these words. By the grace of the vast celestial bed, may his past karma be forever absolved, and may he depart the winding paths of the Yellow Springs to awaken to the moment of liberation. Since there is a Heavenly Paradise, may he dwell in the realm of carefree wandering.\n\nAgain, prostrate, I lament: my five viscera are torn asunder, yet I must sever my love for my late father. Though a hundred bodies could not repay him, the youngest daughter’s sorrow is unbearable. Bowing low, I pour forth my sincerity; lifting my gaze, I implore the lofty ear of Heaven.\n\nI recall how my father, though his children’s marriages were settled, endured such hardship. His burden never lightened from his shoulders, and illness clung to him like an abscess upon his back. The stars dimmed and fell, breaking my heart like the fleeting lotus of a dream. Days and months passed, and in the blink of an eye, sixty days slipped away. I long to sing the *Summons of the Soul* like Song Yu, yet dare I present the plea of Ti Ying to redeem a crime? I humbly pray that his name be erased from the Black Register, that he may soon receive the Golden Register and White Tablet. May he bow before the Vermilion Mound and be delivered through the fires and waters of the ritual pools. May all who have sunk into suffering together ascend to joy.\n\n**Petition for the Blood Bowl to Deliver the Mother**\n\nProstrate, I reflect: the Eighty-Four Thousand Kalpas of the Feathered Realm stretch boundless, without shore. The Fifty-Three Buddhas of the Blood Bowl vow to deliver all beings. If one can create such karmic conditions, the merit is inconceivable.\n\nI recall how I, born a woman, once honored my mother’s example. Yet my love for her was like the magpie’s, and I could not repay her as the people of Juqiong did. Forty-nine years have passed—where now is her voice and form? One hundred and six days have flown by like the months and years. How could she not think of me? I must rely on the power of the Buddha to awaken the dream beneath the scholar-tree and enlighten her to past causes, that she may gladly attend the feast of reeds. By this, may the later fruit be perfected, and may she reverently welcome the Three Realms. May all in the ten directions be illuminated, and may the eighteen layers of hell be shattered, each prison opened. Without passing through a hundred million kalpas, may all beings in every kalpa attain deliverance. May her true body be purified, so that no orchid-scented waters are needed to wash her tassels. May her Dharma-eye be opened, so that no golden needle is required to scrape away her film. From this moment onward, may all be made new. May she receive life and nurture, forever free from suffering.\n\nIn the court of King Yama, may she indeed receive the grace of Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva. In the Tuṣita Palace, may she join her palms and listen to the teachings of Lady Māyā.\n\n**Petition for the Husband and Daughter**\n\nProstrate, I reflect: the Most High cherishes life, yet why was his life not granted its full span? Since ancient times, death has been inevitable—yet who pities this departed soul? Beating the earth, I hear no response; calling to Heaven, I make my plea.\n\nI recall how I, knowing my fate to be meager, never found a proper match. I think of my daughter, her mouth still smelling of milk, her ignorance profound, and my husband, whose topknot of hair had barely been tied in gratitude—why was his illness incurable? After only eight days, he perished. What could be done? I am left with lifelong regret. O soul, where have you gone? Forever you return to the endless night.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I offer this blood-written plea, hoping that my feelings may be considered and my sins redeemed.\n\nReflecting on the weight of merit and virtue, the transmission of talismans is inscribed in golden registers and white missives. Surely father and son ascend together, their names etched upon the jade chambers and cinnabar terraces. May all good destinies share in this grace.\n\n**Prayer for Husband and Child**\nProstrate, I consider: earth stretches far and heaven endures long, yet none hear the suffering of the wronged. Frost chills and the moon gleams—who knows the sorrow of the widowed? I dare not speak at length, yet fear I overstep again.\n\nI recall how I, born through kalpas of suffering, endured these two losses. The joy of our family’s rise faded like ephemeral blossoms; the hope of a full life shattered like a broken mirror. Since length of days is fated, what can I do? I know not the cause of good or ill that brought me to this extremity. Though living and dead are sundered, by merit and virtue one may yet ascend. Let me but express my love for my child and convey my longing for home. Though his voice and form seem present, I can only imagine them in the empty courtyard. Where has his soul gone? I pray he may be delivered to the Crimson Mansion, that even the hidden and shadowed beings may together return to the boundless Mahāyāna.\n\n**Prayer for Father from Child**\nProstrate, I reflect: the August Heaven above watches over all and has not forsaken me. In serving the dead as the living, a filial child and obedient descendant offers all. Deeply ashamed of this humble petition, I fear it borders on excessive reverence.\n\nI recall how I, fortunate to dwell among human relations, barely upheld our family’s legacy. Knowing the source of a spring’s flow, how could I not strive to repay its origin? Moved by the scene before me, I express my longing and remembrance. Though my forebear’s remains rest in the grave, all was guided by the divine. Seizing this opportunity, I humbly accept this ascension and dare not forget to offer thanks. Though his spirit does not return, may it wander the dim and silent realms. Virtue is hard to repay; with this simple rite of supplication, I look up to the Great Dao and extend blessings to the underworld.\n\n**Prayer for Parents**\nProstrate, I consider: how vast is Heaven above—how dare I not offer my utmost loyalty? Even a child in arms loves its parents—who lacks this filial piety? Ashamed to repeat myself, I have already stated my plea.\n\nI recall how we, in deep reflection, ever bear the difficulty of serving the dead as the living. In our conduct toward others and ourselves, we find no virtue or filial piety to praise. Thus, we turn to the Emperor of the Eastern Peak and Mount Tai, praying that all beings may together return to the Great Dao. May all men and women devote themselves wholly, all be protected and delivered, and all attain longevity. May spirits hear these hidden words and ascend, spared from suffering.\n\n**Prayer for Father and Ancestors**\nProstrate, I reflect: the grace of Heaven and Earth is profound, and I bow in gratitude for their nurturing virtue. The crisp air of frost and dew—who does not feel the sorrow of offering mugwort? Humbly, I pour forth my sincerity, prostrating before the Azure Heavens.\n\nI recall how I, bound by worldly dust, possess awareness of blood and breath. I cherish the toil of my father and grandmother, mindful of the teachings like those of Kaoshu. In life, I served them; in death, I buried them—this may be called filial, yet I strive to offer my utmost sincerity. Rising early and retiring late, I do not shame my origins. How shall I repay them? Last winter, I vowed to hold the Great Yellow Register Fast, performing rites of thanksgiving and expressing reverence through posthumous offerings.\n\nI pray that their yellowed forms be purified, their jade eyes refined, and their true precepts followed in the School of Purity and Light. May the Southern Palace’s flying crow and the Northern Bureau’s spirits ascend, their talismanic commands fulfilled in speech.\n\n**Prayer for Ancestors**\nProstrate, I reflect: human relations are rightly ordered, deepening the heart of filial piety. The Dao of Heaven is constant, and we truly bear its nurturing virtue. I prepare the sacred altar and humbly invoke the true healing.\n\nI recall how we, bound by worldly duties, live as descendants. The merit of ancestors and the virtue of our lineage protect us, their descendants—how fortunate! With sincere hearts and earnest intent, we place our trust in the spirits without doubt. Let me briefly express my plea and perform this special rite. Ashamed of my repeated petitions, I yet hope for a fraction of private grace.\n\nI pray that the Nine Dark Realms open the way, holding the texts of the Yellow Register. May the Eight Radiant Scenes shine forth, and may we behold the golden-purple visage. Further, I beseech blessings upon our descendants and grace upon the living.\n\n**Prayer of the Perfected One Seeking Forgiveness**\nI have heard that humans, as the most enlightened of beings, knowing their faults, must correct them. Spirits leave no trace for judgment—how can one call them wrong? Yet why do they act wrongly? It is because they rely on humans to act, and thus cannot escape the flattery of ghosts.\n\nI, your servant, hold a sacred office in the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens. Since the Kaiyun era, my shrine has received offerings. From the Kaixi era onward, my temple has been honored with imperial decrees. Though I possess the numinous power of grass and trees, I know not the wonder of ascending as a saint or perfected one. Thus, I have observed fasts, upheld precepts, accumulated goodness, and built merit, advancing to the ranks of immortals. I have been entrusted with duties in the unseen realm, performing my tasks with care—how slight my virtue!\n\nYet I fear that in using medicine to save lives, I may not distinguish the properties of *aconite* and *cinnamon*, *magnolia* and *poria*. In using literature to exhort the world, I may not recognize the errors of *Lu*, the foolish, *Hai*, or *Cheng*. Or in divination, I may fail to deliver the oracle. Or like the wild goose, I may not find rest. I may pray for clear skies, only to bring rain, turning crops to ruin in the summer heat. Or I may pray for rain, only to bring drought, incurring blame from the Wind Earl. Some say good and evil have their retribution—yet why does good not bring good, and evil not evil, like the vanished state of Guo? Or that fortune and misfortune move people—yet why does fortune not bring fortune, and misfortune not misfortune, like the horse of the old man of the frontier?\n\nSome die young, not by fate, misled by shamans’ words into slander. Some live in poverty and hardship, blamed on ghosts’ deceit, unable to rise. Some village festivals involve offerings of meat and wine, violating the precepts. Some communal feasts borrow kitchens, offending the fast. Thus, *chimei* and *wangliang* seize the opportunity to ride their *men* carts, while the sins of *taotie* and those who pray with peach wood have no escape.\n\nIn deep anxiety and fear, I tremble uncontrollably. Fortunately, the Most High has sworn a vow of compassion, and the Great Dao provides rites of repentance. Humbly, I stand before the sacred presence and confess my failings.\n\nI humbly beseech the renewal of the old and the proclamation of amnesty for calamities. May past transgressions of reckless words be redeemed, and future diligence in service be demanded, that all may be pacified.\n\nIn governance, I dare not stir up trouble, nor seek merit through toil and hardship. In personal conduct, I dare not hold office without earning my keep. To succor the living and deliver the dead, to aid the upright and expel the wicked—I shall exert myself in practice and repay with utmost loyalty.\n\nMoreover, I hope that my person may enter the radiance of the precious pearl, and my every step fulfill the Three Thousand Precepts. Though my virtue lacks the fragrance of millet and rice, may my sacrifices endure for a hundred generations. The devotion of your servant is boundless, earnest to the utmost.\n\n**Thanksgiving for the Bestowal of the Title \"Perfected\"**\n\nI prostrate myself before the majestic lineage of the Great Dao, to which my heart wholly turns in reverence. From the vast expanse of the Great Luo above, the Three Realms all bear witness. How profound is the Celestial Emperor’s favor, and how unfailing the wisdom of the divine beings!\n\nReflecting on my joy, which shook the earth, and the grace that descended from heaven—though ranks are apportioned with distinction, I know my sixteen-character title exceeds all bounds. Where rites grow excessive, disorder follows; I deeply fear the full measure of the thousand-two-hundred-part cycle. Yet through broad consultation, all concur it is both fine and fitting.\n\nThus, I offer the reverence of fasting and purification to express my private gratitude. I humbly pray that in receiving emoluments, I may benefit the people, and that my yang merits be made manifest. Show me the path of illustrious virtue, and bestow further honor upon my yin office.\n\n**Again,**\n\nHeaven’s constancy favors those with virtue; without virtue, one cannot move Heaven. The sage does not claim to know the divine, yet only the divine may enter the sage. With sincerity, I bow and lift my gaze to the azure vault.\n\nI recall that my homeland lies beneath the shade of mulberry and elm, bound in communal kinship. The title \"Spiritual Relief\" has endured for over four hundred years, and its boundless benevolence has been revealed to all under heaven. The people, content in their sufficiency, cherish it without end. Thus, the favor bestowed upon the master has grown ever greater. Gathering the feathered and robed, I prepare humble offerings, pledge alliance with the Three Realms, and dare not betray the grace of former days. Through the grand Rite of Thanksgiving to the Heavenly Net, I may perhaps express this heartfelt reverence. I further hope for your radiant presence at the ritual seat, that blessings may be conferred upon all people.\n\n**Prayer for the Protection of Crops**\n\nHeaven does not speak, yet its goodness responds—when it is said to rain, rain comes in its season. When people desire and follow, blessings sought arrive in full. With sincerity, I bow and lift my gaze to the azure vault.\n\nI recall that my humble abode shelters beneath the vast turning of the cosmos, like a swallow nesting in a tent’s eaves. Should I ever fail in reverence, I shall surely correct my faults. My plea is not for external gain but only to avert disaster. Since I have already received abundant grace, I still pray for its fulfillment. Having been touched by this favor, how can I ever rest in ease? I shall ever hold the fear and trembling of one who has received much. I beg for your compassion and dare not forget to repay your virtue.\n\nI pray that the young grow strong and the old remain vigorous, that men and women alike may thrive. May the lowlands know no dampness, the heights no drought, and may all be filled with abundance.\n\n**Again,**\n\nThe people regard food as heaven; I deeply fear that Heaven’s heart may send down reproach. Even when the Xia prayed for grain from the thousand gods, they still hoped the Emperor’s wrath might be turned away. Below, I lead the people’s sentiments; above, I appeal to Heaven’s hearing.\n\nI recall that we, who look up in service and down in nurture, are many in number. From spring plowing to autumn harvest, the year’s labor nears completion, and we hope for abundant fields and plentiful crops. Yet if pests or minor blights arise, how can we atone through our offerings? Only by removing harm can benefit flourish; only by doing good can auspicious omens descend.\n\nMay the wind blow gently, the clouds gather lightly—thus shall the vegetables and salted offerings be presented. May the harvest be reaped in abundance, the grain piled high—thus shall the millet and rice be fittingly offered.\n\n*Xu Xian’s Florilegium, Scroll Ten Concludes*\n*Xu Xian’s Florilegium, Scroll Eleven*\n\n**Proclamation for the Establishment of the Luotian Jiao Ritual, Issued by the Golden Portal’s Conferral of Immortal Writs**\n\nFrom the Three Heavens’ Gate, the Perfected of the Golden Portal’s Palace, charged with the authority of the Heavenly Mechanism’s Secretariat and the office of Wenchang’s Minister of Fortune, whose radiance ascends to the heavens and whose auspicious responses manifest among men:\n\nNow, man is the spirit of the myriad things, his nature endowed with the Five Constants. Fathers, in their kindness, instruct—how could this depend on the carving of wheels? Sons, in their filiality, admonish—how much more do they honor the towering trees of their forebears. Elder and younger brothers, like the *chi* and *xun* flutes, take turns sounding the harmony of the household’s zither. True friendship, rooted in heartfelt exchange, is praised like the clans of Xiao, Zhu, Wang, and Gong. When righteousness runs deep, it is revered like the bonds of Xing, Jin, Ying, and Han. Such is the foundation of moral instruction, the unshakable pillar of human relations.\n\nLet none oppress the weak with strength, nor overwhelm the few with the many. Let none neglect kin for strangers, nor allow the lowly to surpass the noble. When the cap of the superior and the sandals of the inferior remain in their rightful places, when names and ranks are preserved, then the scales of justice will be balanced, and great peace may be hoped for. Then shall culture and renown flourish—could this be mere jade, silk, bells, or drums?\n\nTo propagate transformation and uphold the current, one must embody Heaven’s Dao to bring blessings. To observe customs and examine mores, one must apply effort in human affairs. As for the promotion or demotion of the unseen and the manifest, rewards and punishments must be certain. Among those who oversee the city gods and earthly spirits, some may quell disasters of water and fire, some may bring rain and sunshine in due season, some may settle the wild geese in peace, and some may cause the tortoise and milfoil to speak. Where virtue is worthy of praise and merit is recorded, they shall be publicly recommended and duly promoted. But if they are dull-witted and unresponsive, if they fawn like false ghosts, if they cling to corrupt customs and are called licentious, if their foul deeds are notorious yet they refuse to reform—then they have brought calamity upon themselves, and disaster shall befall their persons. This office, having investigated and verified, shall on that very day enact thorough reforms.\n\nApart from the memorial already submitted to the True Bureau of the Three Realms and the City God, this proclamation is hereby issued for public notice.\n\n**Proclamation for the Jade Palace’s Conferral of the Immortal Tablet and the Grand Offering of the Luo Heaven**\n\nTo the Three Heavenly Gates, the Perfected of the Jade Palace, who currently hold office—once appointed as Recorder of the Thunder Bureau’s Mysterious Ministry, once as the Supreme Minister of Longevity in the Southern Culmen—harmonizing the myriad transformations and governing the care of all living beings.\n\nWind to nourish the people, rain to nourish the people, regulating cold and heat, yin and yang in balanced order. Clothing to clothe us, food to feed us, ensuring mulberry and hemp, grain and millet bring abundance and prosperity. When forms are knit, men chant reverence, women chant devotion. When spirits descend, the moon becomes the essence, the sun the soul. Each has its office, each its appointed duty, fortunate to attain liberation through karmic conditions. Embodying the Dao and virtue to shed radiant light, enabling Yang Zhen to transmit purity and integrity through his lineage. Thus, Bi must surely regain his rank as lord and marquis—what wisdom may grasp, folly cannot, for what is granted by man is also granted by Heaven.\n\nAs for prayers for rain or sunshine, one may move unseen through heaven and earth. The Minister of Agriculture oversees the harvest, the Director of Silks manages hemp and flax—each holds their rightful post. The Market Official regulates commerce, the Artisan Inspector refines materials—none neglect their duties. Yet if one follows deviant paths, failing to reflect on the root, allowing demons and malevolence to arise and inflict harm, this is the bitter brew you have brewed yourself—though you may repent, can it be undone?\n\nWhether the spirits of *chimei* and *wangliang* run rampant, spreading poison, or the monstrous *taotie* and *taowu* perpetuate treachery and deceit, this office shall never conceal or tolerate such acts. By law, we shall act, ensuring that in the yang realm, the guilty face the punishment of dismemberment, and in the yin realm, their forms are shattered to pieces. We shall sever them with the wind-knife, strike them with the thunder-axe—what man may kill, Heaven shall condemn. Whose fault is this, if not your own?\n\nMoreover, this office has sworn to aid the upright and eradicate the perverse, to succor the living and deliver the dead. Now, filial sons and obedient grandsons, having turned their hearts toward the Dao, first enable their countless ancestors—from parents to great-great-grandparents—to ascend according to their vows. And for the lonely souls and stagnant spirits of the Five Ancient Paths and Three Wretched Realms, though long sunk in suffering, all shall partake in the grace of Heaven.\n\nApart from the memorial already submitted to the True Bureau of the Three Realms and the City God, this proclamation is hereby issued for public notice.\n\n---\n\n**Proclamation of the Bestowal of Honors and Transmission to the Upper Mystery Gate**\n\nWe humbly consider: the Nine Qi abide within the Cavernous Mystery, guarded by the divine. The boundless multitudes of the Ten Directions arrive upon the void. They attend our august presence, bearing witness to the Great Dao. Incense rises in clouds, thick and fragrant; lamps intermingle with the radiance of stars and moon. From afar, we govern the Nine Heavens, solemnly conducting the Three Offerings. With utmost reverence, we serve the Celestial Emperor—how awe-inspiring!\n\nThe divine, vast and responsive, fulfill their duties. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, all receive deliverance. The realm is at peace, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great harmony. Let all officials under your charge attend diligently to their posts.\n\nWe invoke the numinous waters of the Most High, recite the jade texts of the Primordial Beginning. The Five Emperors attend the Perfected, the viscera grow cool and clear. The nation is at ease, the people cultivate simplicity, and all demons withdraw in silence. Ghostly spirits vanish, malevolence subsides. Let this be made known—may all take heed.\n\nThus, the proclamation is issued.\n\n---\n\n**Notice to the Patron of the Retreat, Drafted on Behalf of the High Priest**\n\nIt is said: there is life, and there is death—life and death follow separate paths. Yet to serve the dead as one serves the living is to unite death and life as one. As descendants, how can one lack humaneness? Moreover, this body, this form, was not born among the mulberry trees, nor were your father and mother ever cast upon the waters. If you understand this, how can you not reflect?\n\nStaging colorful performances in the hall—today’s so-called \"old vegetables\"—how countless they are! Weeping in grief by the roadside—today’s so-called \"Gao Yu\"—are there none among them? One should sip bean broth and drink water, fulfilling the joy of filial devotion. Why must one, like a dried fish tied with rope, harbor endless regret?\n\nBetter a cup of spring wine than slaughtering oxen for an extravagant burial. Though you may grieve that the wind and trees never cease, rejoice that heaven and man have this meeting. By observing the retreat and upholding the precepts thus, one may revive the dead and restore the bones—those who accept their lot.\n\nIf ancestors cherish their grandsons with love, how can descendants lack the awareness to reciprocate? Uncles are praised—why wait for the day of gathering pearls? Nephews are not fools—why must they ride in procession on horseback to care for their orphans? Ever mindful of their elder brothers’ lineage, they shelter their descendants; ever pitying their younger brothers’ early deaths, they nurture their offspring.\n\nWhether in the joy of wedding cups or the sorrow of a broken lute, whether in the oaths of shaved heads or the delight of raised brows, as husband and wife, predestined by past lives—through life and death, true affection is revealed. These are the greatest of human bonds, upon which the teachings of propriety depend.\n\nThough still in infancy, none fail to love their parents. We rely upon the Supreme Emperor, who possesses the virtue of cherishing life. Vastly opening the path of deliverance, both the living and the dead benefit. Now, in observance of the Zhongyuan Festival’s continuation of the Xuandu tradition, we reverently join the assembly in establishing the karmic conditions for universal deliverance.\n\nLet good men and good women each awaken their virtuous hearts. Whether near or far, all shall be naturally unobstructed. The merit is extraordinary—merit beyond thought, inconceivable.\n\nWe look up to the retreat’s patron, who deigns to attend the ritual seat. Though you have turned toward the Dao, you also possess a filial and obedient heart. The earth has no prisons, yet Heaven has its halls—separated by no more than a foot’s distance. Good deeds accumulate like mountains, evil runs deep as the sea—even a slight deviation may lead to vast disparity.\n\nThose who do not understand me—what do you seek? You must seek within yourself. I, so-and-so, a humble student of the Heavenly Abode, presumptuously preside over the mysteries of the Dao. Were it not for the presence of the sacred and the drawing of lots, how dare I affix my name and title? Though I lack the capacity to deliver others, I only follow the Dao in my conduct.\n\nShould any in this altar fail in loyalty, the luminous statutes shall impose their penalties. Without addition or omission, let none act with deceitful intent—only with a sincere heart and upright will may merit be fulfilled and virtue perfected.\n\nThus, thus.\nKnow this, know this.\n\nAmidst the myriad generations of ancestors, names inscribed in the registers of immortals, each spanning five kalpas of opportune convergence. The six relations and nine clans, names recorded in the realm of longevity, where eight thousand years pass as spring and autumn. This is hereby respectfully reported for your collective understanding.\n\nThus, the decree is issued.\n**Decree to the Faithful Assembled at the Altar**\n\nNow, as the season of early autumn arrives and the Zhongyuan Festival draws near, when the White Emperor governs the turning of time and the Earth Official conducts his reckoning, Buddhists on this day offer the Ullambana basin, while Daoists establish the Mystic Capital Offering. Though our gates differ and our households diverge, the principle remains one while the rites vary—each striving to transform the people and perfect customs, each holding filial devotion and ancestral reverence in mind. At such a time, how can one not reflect?\n\nVast is the heavens, its qi pure and clear.\nThe grasses [sway] softly, the people hushed and still.\nGazing at the bright moon over Dongting, why wear sorrow like a sash?\nSinging of the crisp wind at Red Cliff, why weep and wail thus?\n\nI turn to my shadow and sigh,\nmy heart grieved, my breath heavy.\nThis body, this hair and skin—bequeathed by my father and mother—how shall I repay them?\nThe fields and homes, the clothing and food of my parents—accumulated virtue of my ancestors—how shall I repay them?\n\nMy ancestor, the Grand Mentor Xie, his admonitions—what day dare I forget?\nMy uncle, Minister Xue, his parted wealth—his kindness was not small.\nThe line *\"Ponds grow grass\"*—this is why Xie of Linchuan dreamed of his brother.\nThe passage *\"Offering water-plants\"* in the *Spring and Autumn*—this is why Han Changli longed for his elder brother.\n\nYet when the younger sister of Yuanwai passed, why begrudge the carved stone?\nWhen the younger sister of Huang the Grand Historian died, why resent the shattered wall?\nStriking the basin and singing, how hard to sever the love of Zhuangzi’s garden.\nSwearing vows upon the boat, how could she break the pact of Gong Jiang’s alliance?\n\nWhat heart is this? What heart indeed?\nThey are human, and I too am human.\nPondering this, what can one say?\n\nThe long night stretches on—deceitfully performing the rites of summoning the soul and calling back the spirit.\nThe Great Lofty Realm is distant—yet fortunately, there exists the method to revive the dead and restore the body.\n\nYou, such people, should vow to cultivate all good fruits and plant this noble cause. Moreover, as the kalpa nears its end, twelve myriad souls shall be chosen to fill the ranks of immortals. Now, with merits and virtues fulfilled, I wish to deliver over seven hundred names—men and women of this assembly—so their souls may ascend to the Realm of Non-Action, their wheel of rebirth unbroken.\n\nYet if any harbor deceit within while feigning purity without, forsaking righteousness and forgetting gratitude, corrupting customs and undermining teachings, scorning the Three Treasures and neglecting the Five Constants—how could such people escape karmic retribution?\n\nSome, once poor and later wealthy, now shamefully conceal their past.\nOthers, once rich and later poor, now resent their forebears.\nAs for their ancestors, their clans, their fathers, their mothers, their uncles, their elder brothers, their wives, their husbands, their younger sisters, their sisters-in-law—abandoning mourning rites, treating kin like strangers, as if deaf and blind. Worse still, they share no more care than horses and oxen, utterly devoid of sorrow, content to herd with deer and swine. Thus, the Yang and Ruo’ao clans, left with no lineage to rely upon—do they not feel shame before the sons of horse-doctors and field laborers?\n\nOnly I open the gate of expedient means, establishing for you this assembly of equality. Without obstruction, let us together plant the seeds of good affinity.\n\nLet those already born and yet unborn never forsake compassion, adapting to circumstances and responding to transformations. Let those with kin and without, with equal loving-kindness, turn strangers into family, together attending the feast, ascending as one into the Dharma-realm. May your hearts open to awakening, free from greed, anger, and delusion. Let the Dao harmonize with nature, guiding all—from ghostly realms and human paths—back to the immortal Way. These words are no falsehood; do not treat them as mere commonplace.\n\n**Notice of Appointment to the Hall of Masters**\nWith reverence serve the Dao, ever mindful of the solemnity of fasting, purification, and ablution. Let those who lead by virtue be your teachers, each fulfilling their duties in conduct and demeanor. Vast and ever-present, majestic in spirit—though unseen and unheard, beyond naming or discussion. Be earnest in devotion, respectful in chaos, ever vigilant in your actions. According to the golden registers and their jade precepts, the system of ranks and duties comprises six disciplines. The three grades of examination you know well; let sincerity be your measure. As one asks the servant about plowing, consult the maidservant on matters of knowledge. No bribes shall suffice—only those of proven ability share the carriage, only the worthy the same boat. Attend to your duties, uphold your stations.\n\nThis is addressed to you all—such is your own cultivation. You must refine your bearing to inspire admiration. Those who heed this shall enjoy blessings; those who hear it shall ascend [to higher realms]. Let unity of virtue prevail; even a single lapse cannot be tolerated. Should any transgression arise, the responsibility for correction rests with all—three admonitions followed by three bows. Reverently observe the prohibitions, receive the registers, and restore the images. Sever wrongdoing, continue merit—neither reward too lightly nor punish too severely. Do not fret over undeserved gains, nor claim unearned success. As the saying goes: \"Without forethought, it begins with you, and returns to you.\" Merit and virtue are of utmost weight—here they begin, here they end.\n\nLet all who hear this take heed and comply in body and spirit.\n\n**Notice**\nThe establishment of teachings and statutes serves as guidance for all. In this world, offices and duties rely on those of trusted heart. Though we appoint from among the known, true talent must first be tested. Gather all without discrimination—cast aside neither a copper coin nor an inch of iron, nor neglect the worthy. Banish the wicked as one wields a sharp plowshare; recognize the dullness of a leaden blade. The six offices and six duties demand unity of heart and purpose. Let no past grudges linger, nor old missteps be repeated. Who is without fault? Yet those who correct their errors are true. The state upholds justice, even as it allows redemption. Ever vigilant, ever consistent—depart with announcement, return with report, as dutiful as to one’s parents. Report by merit, test by word, for the proper order of ruler and subject is thus.\n\n**Proclamation for the Yellow Register Universal Salvation Retreat**\nVast and unfathomable—such is the sage, such is the divine. Radiant and manifest, ever present to left and right. Uprightness is their virtue; salvation their work. Looking up, we revere the boundless compassion of the Most High; looking down, we heed the decrees of our office. With utmost solemnity, we undertake this great endeavor as witness.\n\nLong have we gazed upon the walls of Confucius’ temple; now we borrow the mat of Chen Fan. The spirits declare their return, wishing to enter the gate of cultivation. The retreat orders them; special mats are prepared. Let their faces bear joy, not the distress of the oppressed. Summon them, and they come—let them advance in succession, filling the hall to its narrowest corners. Welcome the familiar as old friends, the new as if long known—this is a once-in-a-millennium gathering. Let the distant come, the near rejoice; why distinguish between this realm and that? Some discuss the seasons’ cold and warmth, others the bonds of kinship—laughter fills the hall, hands join in song. What are ghosts, if not kin? All are human here.\n\nSpread the mat and share the meal; coarse grain is no shame. If private devotions to the Buddha arise, let them be conveyed. Should one not know where to dwell, is that not neglect of their abode? Choose guests with courtesy, deeply grateful for the love of the host, the Sage of the Eastern Way. Those souls selected for salvation shall together journey to the Western Kingdom of Vaisravana.\n\n**Notice for the Altar Wardens**\nProstrate before the three tiers, symbolizing the Three Powers, ascending and descending with solemnity. The eight directions correspond to the eight trigrams, arranged with strict precision. Stars form the weft, constellations the warp; heaven has its gates, earth its doors. Crimson cords stretch seventy-two zhang, charting the lunar cycles’ flow. Eighty-one poles are gathered, uniting the transformations of yang’s mysteries. The characters on the banner are as large as bushels; the floating canopy’s structure rises like a chamber. Light pierces the gates of heaven; incense strikes the pillars, filling the air with fragrance. Thunder Lords drive back intruders; Wind Lords wield their mighty fans. The gods, silent and steadfast, uphold the tilting; the Emperor, vast and majestic, presides above.\n\nShould any demonic forces—be they *kuí*, *xū*, *yù*, or *kuáng*, or the malevolent *chīmèi wǎngliǎng*—dare to act with deceit or spread filth, they shall be met with the unyielding law of the Mysterious and unforgiven. Like shadows caught, voices seized—let them be snared as in a net that leaves no rabbit free. Sever their forms, cut off their heads as an axe levels a wasp’s waist. Exterminate their leaders, root out their followers without mercy. Let the frost’s night be as still as withered orchids; let no wildfire rage to consume both thistle and lingzhi. Transform sand and gravel into southern gold, turn tiles and stones into harmonious jade. In the center of the sacred scriptures’ target, let no beast remain unscathed.\n\nYet how could the gods of the altar, who pluck cicadas with ease, deem their arts too meager? Those with office and duty, with the weight of words, must hold no bias, no private grudges. Guard the Dao with severity, manifest the altar’s clarity. Let ghosts be ominous, immortals auspicious—so it is said of the desire-realm’s flight through the void. Let heaven be free of haze, earth of dust, as we raise the hidden words of the Great Brahma.\n\nIn conducting the retreat and practicing the Dao, boundless merit is accrued. Saving the living, delivering the dead—this is the great affinity. Let all faithful men and women attending the assembly offer utmost reverence and devotion. Should any willfully violate the retreat’s precepts or transgress its prohibitions, they bring calamity upon themselves.\n\nHow could one dismiss the talismans as mere ornamental writings hung upon the wall? These are the very duties of the altar’s overseers. Thus it is, thus it is. Reverent! Reverent indeed!\n\n**Proclamation to the Generals and Officers of the Altar:**\n\nWe have heard that the merit of courtly worship, traced to its origin, began with Attendant Kang of the Capital Bureau. Through such acts, one repays the toil and kindness of parents, thereby attaining the Dao—such filial piety and righteousness defy full expression. Later generations established rites for the living and the dead based on this precedent, and when examining merits, none surpass this as the foremost principle.\n\nMoreover, every person possesses understanding: who is without parents, without uncles and aunts, without siblings, without spouse, without children or nephews? Who does not hold their own body and limbs in highest regard? The living all wish to fulfill their natural lifespan without harm, while the dead all long to return to life, for dry bones to rise as flesh. Without this merit, none can be delivered.\n\nToday, on behalf of [Name] and the assembly, we conclude the retreat. Previously, on the journey of courtly worship, we prepared the yellow registers and petition slips to deliver both the living and the dead. The night-long fast and rite were held to cultivate and exalt this merit. The details are manifold, and without you, Generals and Officers, who would bear witness? Without you, who would transmit the talismans and circulate the decrees? Without you, who would present the memorials and convey the petitions? Without you, who would summon the wandering souls and restore the scattered spirits?\n\nYou, Generals and Masters, stationed before the altar—if they serve as the charioteer, then you are the left; if you serve as the charioteer, then they are the right. Equal in merit, one in body, each must attend to your duties with reverence. Boast not of your goodness, nor claim undue labor. Let the living each fulfill their lives, ascending together to the realm of benevolence and longevity; let the dead each find their rest, wandering together in the heavens of bliss. Both living and dead receive this grace, and all will raise their hands to their brows, declaring: “This is the merit of you, Generals and Officers!”\n\nOn the day your merit is recognized, your names shall be inscribed in the Upper Clarity. These are the secret words of the Most High—there is no falsehood in them.\n\nShould there be those who are inauspicious, disobedient, reckless, irreverent, unrighteous, treacherous, or deceitful—who willfully violate these precepts, defiling virtue until their transgressions reach Heaven—you shall, in accordance with the Mysterious Law, utterly eradicate them without exception.\n\nThus, exhort yourselves, Generals and Officers! Be diligent and steadfast!\n\n**Proclamation.** Again...\n\nThe Palace hereby establishes the Zhongyuan Mysterious Capital Retreat and Offering, and all commissioned generals and officers must conduct themselves with lowered voices and solemn reverence, adhering strictly to the precepts. All proclamations to be issued shall proceed as follows.\n\nProstrate, we acknowledge that the Dao abides in the Great Void, formless and ineffable. Yet when summoned from one’s own primordial destiny, it arrives without delay. The Perfected Ones enforce prohibitions—without proper ritual, it will not act. The talismans of the Numinous Treasure universally proclaim the Nine Heavens. The Primordial Beginning’s *Red Writ* unfolds its myriad regulations. It spreads the five qi of the Five Dragon Divine Waters, coalescing them into numinous power. Wind gathers and smoke summons the Four Spirit Fire-Horses from the four directions, arriving like fine rain or dense mist.\n\nCity Gods, attend in reverence: I command the Demon Kings to guard my chariot, raising the Great Unity’s mighty standard and brandishing spears at the Fiery Gate. Let the *xi* and *wangliang* lurk in concealment; let the *chimei*, *shaokui*, and *xuyu* be swept away, and the mad *xuyu* subdued. The maidens of Wu Gorge shall find no place to cast their covetous gazes. The followers of Chiyou shall ultimately be reduced to withered bones.\n\nTo all assembled: heed this proclamation, and do not invite defilement to entangle you in guilt. Should any act thus, none shall escape destruction. Reflect thrice—though repentance may come, what use is it then? Uphold the Mysterious Law, and consign the wicked to the crooked and perverse. Sever heads and dismember forms, all to be boiled like dragons. Seize by sound and shadow—none shall slip through the net. Those who hear this tremble in terror; those who see it quake in submission.\n\nTo break one’s word is to forsake trust; guard the Dao with severity. Let the Ten Mysteries unfurl and the Eight Effulgences shine forth. May the Three Realms assemble in unison, and the host of Perfected Ones oversee the deliverance. Strike left to the left, strike right to the right. You shall serve as Upright Generals of Dharma Protection. Neither lag behind nor rush ahead—you shall act as Impartial Envoys of Retreat Supervision. Attend to your duties with reverence, unite your hearts as one, and remain steadfast from beginning to end. Such merit is of the highest order, sufficient above to offer to the Seven Ancestral Shrines, and below to deliver the multitudes from the Three Wretched Realms.\n\nWe further pray that Heaven, attaining the One, may be purified, and Earth, attaining the One, may be pacified. In harmony with the divine, the demonic path shall ever be inauspicious, while the immortal path shall ever be auspicious. Thus shall I endure long—heed these commands without error or deviation.\n\n**Proclamation.** Again...\n\nBeneath the Three Heavenly Gates, the appointed officers of the Golden and Jade Towers of the Perfected Ones’ Palaces, having received the reverent investiture of jade seals and been favored with the Master’s grace, now stand in awe. All eyes behold them with astonishment, for their solitary traces seldom stir such wonder. Though they attend to their duties with diligence, their merit must be weighed by the sincerity of their own hearts. Ten eyes gaze upon them, ten hands point toward them—none can escape the impartial judgment of right and wrong, good and evil.\n\nTo walk alone is difficult; to clap with a single hand is impossible. They must rely upon the strategies of civil and martial deployment. Next, to all the generals and officials arrayed around them—radiant to left and right, resplendent in might and spirit—who emerge from being and vanish into non-being, who appear before the eyes only to suddenly linger behind, whose past glory is recorded in the annals of history and whose literary brilliance is still heard today: now, their heroic souls exhaust their utmost loyalty, upon which Heaven and Earth depend for their very standing.\n\nWhen the talisman arrives, receive its command in silence. Craftsmen adhere to compass and square; physicians distinguish ginseng from poria. First take the long, then the short. Servants till the fields; maidservants tend the hearth. They offer their strength; these offer their labor. Each cherishes the joy of the mulberry’s shade—how could it be said that their sustenance is without benefit? In rank, they respond to all things like the resonance of the Yellow Bell, every movement producing sound. They dispel entanglements like a blade newly sharpened on the whetstone, every use free from obstruction.\n\nLet none treat one another as distant as Chu and Yue, for they must rely upon the loyalty of heart and mind like Zhang Liang and Chen Ping. Exterminate demonic forces, and the city gods shall heed their commands. Rescue and deliver all beings, embodying the Supreme’s love for life. Should any hidden spirits dare violate these prohibitions, they shall be judged according to the statutes and publicly subjected to the prescribed punishments.\n\nThose beyond the bounds are called traitors, and the *Yu Dian* provides for their governance by the Ministry of Justice. Those who defy and resist shall face the executioner’s blade as recorded in the *Book of Zhou*. Guard the village gates, pacify the altars of soil and grain, and ensure that every person attains their desires, fulfilling the wish for ease and contentment, that every household enjoys abundance and prosperity.\n\nYou shall not boast of your virtues or display your toils—it is I who shall assess merit and dispense rewards. Offer the finest grains of ritual with reverence; do not bring shame upon the divine. Before the incense and flame, first pray for the longevity of the Son of Heaven. Each shall attend to their duties and not neglect their posts.\n\n**Proclamation.** Again...\n\nLet cinnabar tablets, cinnabar, green lingzhi, and red arrowroot be gathered by physicians. Great beams, small rafters, refined eaves, and short ladders rely entirely on the craft of carpenters. Having refined what is selected, each shall be measured according to its material.\n\nProclamation to the Generals of the Upright Altar and the Inspectors of Ritual Offerings: harmonize like sounds, seek out like kinds. Let your forms be truly upright, your voices truly clear. Serve as guardians to the Four Numinous Beasts, repelling enemies from a thousand *li*, striking terror into the hearts of foxes and jackals. Display the might of wolves and tigers blocking the path, leaving cunning hares at their wits’ end. Embody the power of tigers and leopards in the mountains—be virtuous and invincible.\n\nWhen employed, act; when matters arise, command—abide by my prohibitions. Should any subordinate official dare to summon malevolent spirits, recklessly indulge in madness, or willfully defile, they shall be cut down and eradicated like foxes and rats clinging to a banner’s tassels. Some shall be released, some seized, like chicks within a cage—judged with weight or lightness, with impartial right and wrong. Do not let sacred fungi mingle with rotten weeds, nor auspicious birds with common feathers.\n\nThe celestial statutes are most precise—report any violations at once. Now seal the mud pellet, spread the ritual mat, and reverently welcome the imperial carriage in its stately procession, receiving the Emperor’s graceful arrival. Some shall raise the great banner before and plant the tiger standard behind; others shall wield the white tassel in the right hand and brandish the yellow battle-axe in the left.\n\nLet none transgress these commands; align your hearts as one, and in your efforts, go beyond the measure. When merit is weighed for reward, no stinting shall there be. When virtue and achievement are complete, your names shall be inscribed among the stellar generals of the Southern Palace. Longevity, prosperity, and peace shall answer in part the hopes of the eastern host.\n\nBy this proclamation, let all be made known.\n\n**Notice.**\n\nMoreover, in the administration of ordinances: Those who cultivate hidden virtue shall surely receive manifest reward; those who practice open virtue shall surely attain illustrious renown. Now the Nine Heavens’ Two Perfected Ones have ascended to the ranks of immortals, their offices arrayed among the Nine Heavens. Can the virtue they hold in human hearts be measured? You, officers and generals, may see them with your eyes, hear them with your ears, and engage them in speech—no doubt remains, no uncertainty lingers. Therefore, you must unite your hearts and pool your strength to assist in the completion of this work.\n\nShould there be treacherous and deceitful men, ghosts or goblins, inauspicious and perverse, insolent and irreverent, defiling themselves with filth—know that I shall execute Heaven’s punishment through you. The lightly guilty shall be seized and brought before the Celestial Pivot; the heavily guilty shall be dismembered and beheaded. Thus shall Heaven attain unity and clarity, Earth attain unity and tranquility, and the gods attain unity and numinosity.\n\nWhen the day of merit arrives, I shall memorialize the Celestial Court on your behalf, that you may be appointed to the scattered offices of the immortal bureaucracy—how could you remain mere banners and drums for mortal eyes and ears? Yet if the left fails to strike on the left, or the right fails to strike on the right, and you disobey these commands, the fault shall be yours alone. The Perfected Ones, as celestial generals, shall have cause to reproach you—this is the hundred-times-tempered steel, daily sharpened to slice a thousand oxen, sheathed and stored, yet not my shame.\n\nLet all take heed to these words.\n\n**Notice.**\n\n**Notice to the Five Marshals of the Boundless Realms—Wei, Zhao, and Diao**\n\nBehold: bright moon and white dew, the passing of time—who among us is without the sorrow of withered grasses and desolate winds? Let all beneath the August Heaven and Earth, all gods above and below, offer reverent sincerity, upright and balanced, and by this karmic connection, cultivate merit and virtue.\n\nNow, within this Daoist sanctuary, rites are prepared in purity. First, we address the pressing concern of those departed souls who have fallen into the three wretched paths, the bitter destinies, with no means of escape—how then may they ascend? Though officials exist to oversee such matters, do they bear no burden of reproach?\n\nWe summon you, warriors fierce as *pixiu*, to render service swift as hawks and hounds. On my decree, come forth at once. Soar through the void, transform at will, emerge from nothingness into being, and traverse every shadowed yin realm, every place of gathering. There, you shall summon the souls to be delivered at this assembly, escorting them here. Proclaim to them:\n\nThe primal might of tigers and leopards cannot long endure in confinement—thus sings the *Zhao Te* of Huainan’s Xiao Mountain.\nThe belly of the river fish is no place for lingering delay—thus intones the *Diao Hun* of the Changsha Grand Tradition.\n\nWhose ode shall we raise to praise the banners of the learned?\nWho shall sing the verses that revive the bleached bones of Xianyang upon the battlefield?\nWho shall loose the bound spirits of Changping, their nineteen years of woolen garments now worn to naught?\nDid Su Wu truly receive the wild goose’s message? A thousand years later, the marble pillar still stands.\nWas Ding Lingwei truly a crane? Yet Zhang Han’s longing for water shield and perch stirred his heart, just as Tao Yuanming grieved for his pines and chrysanthemums.\n\nO souls! O souls! Return to your former abodes.\nThe hour is now! The hour is now! Do not let it slip away.\nFrom this moment onward, all shall be made new.\nLook up and receive compassion; look down and find pardon.\n\nThe golden rooster is set before the gate, its augury already declared.\nThe courier stars streak past—no wolfish hearts, no wild ambitions remain.\nThe stubborn and unenlightened shall be transformed, their debts repaid like oxen at the butcher’s block.\nThe jailers shall follow the writs of judgment.\nThough bound in fetters, they are not guilty.\nYet let the sight of their tattered robes shame the people—hold them no longer; release them all.\n\nThe Dharma’s gate offers expedient means—who would scheme like a thief to cross its threshold?\nThe immortal path is free and unbounded—who would feign the folly of Zu and Yu to deceive their way?\nThe world is vast—where else would these souls wander?\nThe scholar Niu lost his way in delusion—was Bo Ji truly a seductive phantom?\nThe old man drunk on the road—did Fu Qi dare stir mischief?\n\nLet none be trapped in the schemes of Chen and Cai, nor hindered by the obstructions of Zang and Cang.\nShould any petty ghosts act recklessly, you are to obey the Mysterious Law, seize them, and bring them forth.\n\nGo forth and heed these commands.\nWhen the day of merit comes, your names shall be inscribed in Heaven. You shall serve as attendants across the Three Realms, welcomed by the Five Emperors—this is no humble station.\nThe Nine Dark Realms shall turn back their souls; the Seven Generations shall emerge from the long night. Boundless deliverance shall follow.\n\nThis decree must be obeyed without delay or disrespect.\n\n**Notice.**\n*Concluding the Address to the Assembly for the Blood Pool*\n\nIn reverence, we acknowledge the vastness of the Feathered Realm’s pool, spanning eighty-four thousand leagues—boundless, shoreless, without edge or bank. At the Assembly of Universal Light, the fifty-three buddhas, embodiments of great sagacity, great vows, great compassion, and great mercy, have expansively revealed the Dharma-gate of delivering the living and ferrying the dead. How could we fail to cultivate the karmic causes of past and future?\n\nWe humbly reflect: born as women in the world of Jambudvīpa, during the time of bearing sons and raising daughters, how could we avoid the defilements that foul heaven and earth? Unrepentant, we tread upon thin ice. Truly, we fear that on the day of Gengshen, our transgressions may be recklessly tallied. Beginning in the year of Guisi, we seek to absolve our faults—whether to repay a mother’s kindness, cultivate our own blessings, aspire to be born in the Pure Land, or prepare a bridge for others. Fortunate that the measure of merit has come full circle, we pray that both the living and the dead may benefit.\n\nOn the third day of the third lunar month, golden figures appeared in the auspicious meanders of the Qu River. Like the Buddha Śākyamuni, who manifested upon Vulture Peak to expound the Dharma and vow to deliver all beings, we now earnestly invite four or five virtuous masters to establish a night-long Daoist ritual. Before the Mirror of Karma, in the halls of King Yama, we wholeheartedly prostrate to the Master Who Saves from Suffering. Within the Alms Bowl Hermitage, beside the table of Rājagṛha, we bow in homage to the bodhisattva Maudgalyāyana.\n\nWe make offerings to the worthy sages of the ten directions, welcome the eight compassionate lords, and dedicate the merit to the assembly of holy beings. We traverse the heavens, earth, and watery underworld, clearing paths for all. Summoning the departed souls, we guide them to recognize the white clouds. With mantras, we offer sweet dew and food; with lotus lamps, we illuminate the ninety-nine layers of hell’s darkness; with orchid-scented waters, we wash clean the sixty-six joints, bringing cool purity.\n\nWe separately prepare a nighttime feast for King Yama of the Scorched Face, universally bestow alms upon the asuras and all beings, and broadly extend relief to the orphaned souls, the stagnant spirits, and those trapped in the five sufferings and three evil destinies. May all sentient beings attain perfect enlightenment. After receiving the precepts, they shall be granted certificates as proof.\n\nWe pray that the departed may wander the Western Regions, beholding Avalokiteśvara in the lapis lazuli gardens; that those who preemptively cultivate merit may live as steadfastly as Mount Tai, attending the Queen Mother’s banquet by the Kunming Pool. May the sun of the Buddha shine ever brighter, bringing joy to humans and gods.\n\n**Notice of the Establishment of the Blood Pool Ritual Altar**\n\nIn reverence, we call forth wandering souls and restore lost spirits—especially on the third day of the third lunar month, the anniversary of the first crossing at Sizhou. For the benefit of beings, the thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Avalokiteśvara manifests in boundless freedom, vowing to become the incarnation of the Savior from Suffering and the King of the Scorched Face.\n\nAll disciples of the buddhas, if you wish to know the causes of past lives, sit again, and I shall tell you: swallowing charcoal and blackening the body is folly, deceit. Offering uncut jade is sufficient—why go further? Those who gnashed their teeth to pieces did so to establish martial merit; those who swallowed their tongues to death did so in shame over state affairs. Though their names are recorded in history, indelible, they dared not harm the hair and skin bestowed by their parents.\n\nBy the Miluo River, the waters stretch dark and vast; on Mount Shouyang, the winds blow cold and fierce. Eight thousand *li* to Chaozhou, cast adrift in lands of miasmic mists and poisonous vapors. Nineteen years upon the sea, stifled beyond the northern snows and desert sands—buried grievances unvoiced, yet their integrity stood tall. The Earl of Lu appeared in a dream to King Zhao of Yan; the descendants of Panhu were named by Emperor Gaoxin. Lord Wei transformed into a crane; the virtuous sister became a cat. Though they possessed human hearts, they were not spared the destinies of beasts.\n\nFor me, girded with gold and robed in purple—what need had I for a bamboo bowl and gourd ladle, unable to bear such hardship? To hasten as a menial, to serve as another’s slave; to pore over classics and histories, to act as a scholar’s scribe—what difference lies between noble and base?\n\nTraveling at dusk through rain, at dawn through clouds, I recall the dreams of Wu Mountain. Greasing my chariot, feeding my horse, my soul follows the wanderings of Pan Valley. Upon the One-Sandal Ridge, lightly I tread—where do I go? Before the Jade Coffin Hall, proudly I stand—where do I turn? Buried alone by tigers, devoured by serpents, like the ghost of Ruo’ao, without refuge. The son of Yuling did not die—who was he, enduring suffering age after age? Now, dead at last, all forms are empty.\n\nEighty-four thousand kinds of creatures, wriggling and fluttering; three hundred sixty classes of beings, feathered, furred, scaled, and shelled. I have heard of the myna bird reciting the name of Amitābha Buddha; of the clam transformed into Avalokiteśvara. Sparrows gather to chant sutras; geese listen to the Dharma.\n\nTonight, the patrons of this ritual, led by so-and-so, have established a night-long Daoist ritual in the Hall of Remaining Blessings within the Eastern Palace of Spiritual Salvation. We separately prepare a measure of food and widely open the Dharma-gate. Whether sentient or insentient, what distinction is there between early and late awakening? Since you have come to attend, why ask further?\n\nThe noble one contends with none; the humane bears no lingering grudge, nor gathers factions to cast out factions. Let none exalt themselves or compare self and other. Each erects their own barriers—free from anger, free from delusion, free from preference, free from aversion. The ghost of kinship looms large, while other ghosts shrink endlessly, locked in the snail-and-clam struggle of mutual devouring. You dwell north of the sea, I south—like horses and cattle, our winds never meet. Yet across the three thousand great worlds, where are the seventy-two ranks of men?\n\nExcellent, excellent. Thus it is, thus it is.\n\nFields know no starving poor; the Buddha holds compassion. In murky waters, wash your feet; in clear, wash your cap-strings. Whether in purity or progress—both are fitting. Cold becomes clothing, hunger becomes food. Is this not joy? Is this not delight?\n\nLeap beyond the Gate of Ghosts, recognize the path to heaven. Do not let precepts and disciplines instead plunge you into confusion. Receive, uphold, and practice—you should heed this well.\n\nThus the proclamation is posted.\n\n**Proclamation at the Dismissal of the Ritual Assembly**\n\nThe ghosts of Lü return in words—knowing death, yet not knowing life. The fast unifies them. Do not fear scarcity, but fear falling short. Now we prepare a single mat, summoning the ten directions. They come, drifting and carefree, vast and present as if here. Whether in thought or thoughtlessness, neither thought nor thoughtlessness—neither non-thought nor non-thoughtlessness.\n\nIf sentient, if insentient.\nIf neither sentient nor insentient.\nIf old, if young—each in due order of honor.\nIf noble, if base—make no distinction of high or low.\n\nI extend compassion, wishing you to generate a heart of purity and five-colored clouds of radiance.\nBy night, you must listen to the Dharma spoken by the Feathered Forest Guards of the Southern Palace.\nThe eight-flavored celestial banquet—you must hear the scriptures expounded by the Queen Mother of the Western Realm.\n\nWhy wait to be clad in creeping fig, only to be torn asunder?\nWhy wait to feast on chrysanthemum blossoms, only to wither away?\n\nTake refuge in the Treasure of the Dao, escape the ghostly bureaus.\nAll equally receive the kindness of deliverance, forever severed from the suffering of sinking and drowning.\n\nA single sprinkle of sweet dew—\nalready abundant, already rich, already sufficient, already moistening.\nAscend together to the Azure Heaven of Origins,\nwithout prejudice, without insistence, without rigidity, without self.\n\n**Meritorious Dharma Utterance for Universal Deliverance**\n\nWe gaze upon Mount Hu, praying for longevity as to the Southern Mountains.\nWe pay homage at the Peak Court, bowing before the Purple Palace to inscribe our names.\nOn the third day of the third month, the sky is bright and the qi clear—\nthe six senses and six perceptions are cleansed of dust and defilement.\n\nPlant good fruits upon the assembly of the Spirit Mountain,\ngive birth to golden lotuses in the pond of the Feathered Realm.\nThose who hold the grasses to summon souls and offer prayers for the departed—\nmay they behold the visage of Māyā.\nWith flowers tucked behind their ears, those beauties—\nmay they wish to journey to the Land of Bliss.\n\nLet this serve as a bridge and a permanent tally.\nThus the document is issued.\n\n**Proclamation to the Departed Souls of the Southern and Northern Temples**\n\nWhere men are bright, ghosts are dark—yet when ghosts return, their spiritual souls descend to earth while their ethereal souls ascend to heaven, and heaven may be reached. Following the rites and canons, we broadly establish vegetarian feasts, seeking to forge karmic bonds with all beings. We wish to borrow but a square inch of ground, for who would say the waters of a well or valley cannot sustain a school of fish? Fortunately, the mountains of pine and cypress suffice to shelter flocks of crows—none shall be excluded.\n\nWe make this special provision in advance: holding orchid grasses to dispel misfortune, scattering flowers in the grove to exalt the Great Brahmā. Lamps and candles glow in the moonlight of night, while banners and pennants dance in the morning breeze. If we would aid these souls—how could we not proceed by this Way?\n\nLet them eat of rice and wear of brocade—shall they not know warmth and fullness? Let them taste our horses and anoint our chariots, that their wandering wishes may be fulfilled. How could we bear even one to weep in solitude? Thus, though they come from a thousand *li* away, the distance is not far. The lairs of dragons and serpents shall directly ferry their boats; the passes of tigers and leopards shall unlock their chains.\n\nLet each rest in their place—what doubt remains? Though the dreams of skulls are not the spring and autumn of the human world, if liver and gall are lost, it is as if one’s own kin have become strangers. All are neighbors, all are kin—what fences exist? What divisions of \"you\" and \"me\"?\n\nWe issue this proclamation first—let there be no clamor. May the Earth-Lord Bright King temporarily serve as a bodhisattva exhorting virtue. Above, the August Heaven; below, the Empress Earth—truly they hear the words of filial sons and obedient grandsons. In the southern fire marsh and northern water pool, they shall naturally attain the wondrous refinement of form and essence. Without distinction of noble or base, all shall be enabled to ascend.\n\nThus the proclamation is posted.\n\n**Proclamation to Wandering Spirits**\n\nWe declare: the life you were given was never truly yours—from this moment, let death return to life.\n\nThe Dao is fundamentally non-action; henceforth, turn your hearts toward the Way. Seizing the moment of awakening, the karmic conditions of past lives, the merit defies all measure.\n\nThe immortals know the greatest joy. To the east lie the caverns of Cloudy Mount and the chambers of Green Mound; to the west, the celestial city of Tianyong and the terraces of Dark Garden; to the south, the mountains of Qingdu and the palaces of Flowing Fire; to the north, the courts of Supreme Mystery and the halls of Purple Void. From present to past, from ancient times to now, countless millennia have passed. Though this realm and that may differ in strength, they lie hundreds of millions of miles apart—ordinary folk cannot reach them, the vulgar cannot hear of them.\n\nThis is the land where the great sages of the ten directions wander and rest, the gathering place of the lofty perfected ones of the Three Realms. Its governance is effortless, its people pure and simple. Clothing and food arise naturally; forms and faces are upright and proper. There is no noble or base, no rich or poor, no right or wrong, no self or other, no taking or giving, no love or hatred.\n\nThat which is born is born, yet never ends. That which takes form takes form, yet never exists.\n\nThrough countless generations it endures, through kalpas unending it remains. The sun and moon shine without cease, wind and rain follow their proper measure. The four seasons proceed in constant harmony, the five grains ever ripen in abundance. Rare blossoms and sweet herbs bear names each distinct; numinous mushrooms and auspicious grasses defy all description of their forms. Those patterned in five colors are not few, nor are the nine-hued phoenixes with three feet. The tortoise called *Ben* lives yet a hundred years; jade hounds bay at night, golden cockerels herald the dawn. Cloud-wreathed mountains stretch boundless, rivers flow vast and deep. Though set within this very cosmos, it presents a scene of another kind—dim and distant, beyond all bounds, a primal heaven not yet divided, swirling in primordial chaos.\n\nOne might call oneself a man of Fuxi’s age, yet never suspect one has lived to the kalpa’s end. To be born here, to grow here—could one not rejoice? Could one not delight? You, departed spirits, who would inquire of that other world: I have heard the wondrous Dharma, and it may serve as a bridge to this place, a means to bind karmic ties with all beings. Thus we establish the Mysterious Capital Offering, the ritual precinct solemn and still in the boundless void. We open the summons to the Celestial Physicians, the divine tigers perform the lads’ dance. We enact the Hunyuan writ, repent toward the directions, receive precepts and transmit talismans. We make universal offerings to the Ten Kings, brightly repaying the Three Realms. We proclaim the image-texts, intone the scriptures. Lamp-light pierces the realm of darkness; the unhindered feast of measured food is universally bestowed. Bathed in the Flower Pool, we wash away the floating veils of past years. We open the roads of the underworld, and now discern today’s journey. Turn not back—step firmly forward. Five *zhang* below the earth, a pearl the size of a millet grain hangs in the empty mystery; nine gates open in the heavens, leading straight through the Great Floating Li Soil to the First Azure. The words above are true—hear them well.\n\nThus the proclamation is posted.\nAgain...\n\nHolding fast the Golden Deity’s seasonal rites, the Lesser Howl enacts its authority. The Middle Prime is the time for reviewing the registers of life; the seventh day is the assembly for celebrating birth. According to the seasonal customs of Jing and Chu, this legacy endures—stirring the hearts of all beings as wind and landscape shift. Leaves fall in the courtyard: we sigh at the fleeting passage of days and months. The dew’s chill sobers the air: we lament our forms and shadows, mourning ourselves. What has gone cannot return; what has passed cannot be pursued. Were we to compose a \"Summons of the Soul\" in the manner of Song Yu, we fear the soul might not come when called. Were we to emulate Jia Yi’s \"Lament for the Dead,\" our sighs would be in vain, for none would understand us.\n\nNow, wishing to inquire into the methods of life, we first enter the Assembly of Universal Deliverance. The Most High possesses the scriptural hymns for rescuing the suffering and delivering the departed; the *Lingbao* holds the rites for reviving the dead and restoring the living. These are the essential ford for transcending the world—here one may seize the moment and awaken to the Dao.\n\nAt the outset, what is called \"life\"? What is called \"death\"? Yet at its ultimate, there is neither death nor life.\n\nNow, the patron of this fast, [Name], has conceived this aspiration and wishes to open the gate of expedient means. If you spirits possess awareness, you may tread the path of return. At the sight of Mount Xian’s weeping cliffs, your souls shall ascend here. The rightful community is restored, and no soul shall fail to descend. The feast of this fast transcends the dusty world: to the east lies the Wilds of No Purchase; to the west, the Land of Silence; to the south, the Courts of Kunlun; to the north, the Palace of Primordial Mystery. Yet all these lie but within the space of a single thought—go straight, and you reach the First Azure Heaven. Coming and going freely, unobstructed and unbounded, countless bodies gather, entering a millet-grain pearl suspended in the void. We summon the Five Directional Lads, who hold lotus blossoms to guide the way.\n\nLet this admonition be heard and known.\n\nThus the proclamation is posted.\n\nAfter the court’s dismissal, the notice is posted below the realm.\n\nLi, the Daoist officer, burns the memorial tablet—this is the occasion for Lady Zhang’s release from her cup. When the Merit Officer recites the scriptures, it becomes the path for none to transcend.\n\nRecords of events and transmissions of the numinous resound through past and present.\n\nAlas, you who dwell in the six dark passes of the underworld and the three wretched destinies of suffering! Through endless nights, you have not glimpsed the light of sun or moon; through kalpas of many lives, how could you know the misty radiance beyond the world?\n\nTonight, at this very hour, come hasten to the Dharma assembly. To the left and right, compose yourselves. Though there are distinctions of rank, there is no division of noble and base. From Yue in the south to the Hu in the north—why separate you as \"us\" and \"them\"? From dawn to dusk, what difference is there between new ghosts and old? Since we now share the bond of those who meet as friends by the roadside, there is no need to follow banners and divide into factions like cattle.\n\nI have true words—you should listen closely. Those who gather ferns for food—how do they compare to those who feast from the celestial kitchens? Those who stitch lotus leaves for clothing—how do they compare to those robed in cloud-silk? Though Su the Academician possessed talent, he still suffered hunger and cold. How could the aspirations of Wang the Top Graduate not lie in warmth and sustenance?\n\nNow, take this single drop of pure soul-water and transform it into the gate of sweet dew for the great thousandfold world. The Floating Li Soil lies directly before the First Azure Heaven, from the realm of form to the formless realm. Mount Tai is but the Eastern Marchmount’s palace—enter the Small Heavenly Gate to reach the Great Heavenly Gate. Do not stray onto the path of delusion; together, return to the Great Dao.\n\nAlas, you lonely souls—alive, you drift like floating clouds; dead, you rest like fading shadows. Why then cling to the burdens of mouth and body? Is it not because your hun and po have yet to find their home, and so such thoughts arise?\n\nOne sip of jade nectar stirs a hundred emotions; when the dark frost is pounded away, the cloud maiden appears. I ponder the intent of this verse—could it be that rich flavors fail to satisfy the mouth? Woven from mist and purple silk, the robe brings only toil without joy, the face left unadorned. I savor the meaning here—could it be that light warmth fails to comfort the body?\n\nThe affairs of celestial immortals I dare not discuss. As for the spirit way, it cannot but rely on mortals to act: offerings of grain must be made, silks and cloth must fill the sacrificial pits. Yet are these grain and silk truly what the spirits depend upon?\n\nThus Confucius said: *\"Eating coarse rice, drinking plain water, resting one’s arm as a pillow—joy lies therein.\"* Zilu said: *\"I wish for carriages and horses, light furs, to share them with friends until they wear out, without regret.\"* Mencius said: *\"With five mu of land, plant mulberry—those of fifty may wear silk.\"* Again he said: *\"With a hundred mu of fields, do not rob them of their seasons—an eight-member household may know no hunger.\"* These words of the great sages, inscribed in books, were set forth for humankind.\n\nThe starving man beneath the mulberry tree wished to become a warrior. The affection for the coarse robe nearly cost the master his life. Straw sandals and hempen cloth—how frugal! Lotus garments and chrysanthemum meals—how pure! For clothing and food are what all people depend upon; not a single day can they be lacking.\n\nHow bitter it is—endless sands without resentment, yet dim and desolate. Cast among blades and arrows, heaven and earth grow sorrowful. Bones become the soil of a foreign land; souls become ghosts of a neighboring realm. With no one to offer mourning or sacrifice, what is to be done?\n\nDuke Cheng of Wei dreamed of Kang Shu, who said: *\"They vie to take my offerings.\"* The ghosts of Ruo’ao, if not fed by sacrifices, will their fate not soon perish? And consider the mantis seizing the cicada, the hound Han Lu snatching the swift hare, the chicken pecking at insects, the hawk striking at mice and sparrows—all rush for food, harboring no malice. The golden-robed lord, the black-clad master, the loom weaving new brocade, the powder passed down from the Qin Terrace—though called unknowing, each still seeks honor and nobility.\n\nThe bee’s flower, the fly’s buzzing pipe, the mosquito’s drone, the louse’s gnawing, the ant’s devotion to the pot, the moth’s flight into the flame—born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation, all cling to life. There is no other reason: each values its own nature and life. Since you know your nature and life, why not turn your hearts toward the Dao?\n\nTonight, eat my dharma-food, wear my dharma-robes, heed my dharma-words. Let all lonely souls within the three thousand great thousandfold dharma-realms—whether with masters or without, with thought or without, with form or without, of the ten kinds—abandon all craving and attachment, cast aside all doubt and suspicion, dissolve the distinctions of self and other. Thus, thus, all shall be delivered, bound straight for the land of rebirth.\n\nRoam south to the wilds of Wangmai, rest north in the silent lands of Moyi, wander west into the dark realms of Xijia, pass east through the primordial radiance of Hongmeng. Above, no heaven; below, no earth—carefree and at ease, is this not joy?\n\nLet this proclamation be known to all. Thus posted.\n\n**Proclamation for the Establishment of the Ullambana Assembly to the Lower Realms**\n\nDescendants of Lü give birth to sons, and sons in turn beget descendants—how dare they forget the nurturing grace of generation upon generation? Men become ghosts, and ghosts again become men, yet they cannot escape the suffering of endless cycles of rebirth. Of all meritorious deeds, none surpasses this.\n\nIn this world of three thousand realms, there are patrons—so-and-so and others—who, on this auspicious day of the Earth Official’s Great Amnesty, reverently establish the Assembly of the Heavenly Worthy in the Mystic Capital. Since they earnestly honor the departed and cherish the distant, how could they fail to extend this kindness to others? They summon all ten kinds of lonely souls to deliver them from every suffering and hardship. Though the cold are clothed and the hungry fed, why do they remain as fleeting as foam, as transient as rest? Why do they still come?\n\nLet each abide in their place. Do not rely on strength to bully the weak, nor raise the armies of Jin and Chu. Do not harbor grudges to seek revenge, nor nurse the hatreds of Wu and Yue. Do not treat fellow passengers as enemies, nor wield spears within your own home. Do not let two tigers fight where the terrain cannot sustain them, nor imitate insects that devour one another and bring ruin upon themselves. Rather than clinging to \"you are you and I am I,\" why not break down the fences between us all?\n\nWhen one speaks of form as non-form and emptiness as non-emptiness, the other shore is seen to be utterly free of wind and waves. Only filial children can bestow blessings upon all, and only the benevolent do not shrink from such offerings. Though this begins with us, how can we bear to leave you behind? In the realm of darkness, a single somersault will lift you to rise upon the Terrace of Fragrant Mist. Recognize the hundred-step stairway—step firmly upon it.\n\nFollow the Mystic Precepts and do not stray onto the path of delusion.\n\n**Proclamation to the Lower Realms**\n\nFor the living, food that pleases the mouth may be fine millet or coarse fodder; garments that adorn the body may be humble hemp or noble fox fur. None can do without these. But for ghosts—how can they partake?\n\nAlas, you foolish and bewildered beings, drifting through the four modes of birth! The six paths hear no sound, and without sound, there are no mouths—though food exists, how can you eat it? They see no form, and without form, there are no bodies—though clothing exists, how can you wear it? Why then do you suffer the torments of sinking and drowning? It all arises from the mind of craving and attachment.\n\nWhen the Duke of Jin took the voice of an ox, it was because sound implies a mouth, and a mouth seeks food. When Master Sheng transformed into a pig, it was because form implies a body, and a body clings to clothing. Pressed by hunger and cold, how can one attend to propriety and righteousness?\n\nNow that you have come here, what will you do? Do not wield a dull hammer to strike a sharp awl. Each person has their shortcomings—do not weary of old fists or sate yourself on poison. What do the noble contend over? Do not let Han Lu and Dong Guo dogs exhaust one another before you, nor let the yellow sparrow and mantis devour each other behind you.\n\nOnly when one is like Lu Kang and Yang Hu, who reconciled the enmity between Wu and Jin, or like You Yu and Zi□, who turned Hu and Yue into brothers, can you cast aside grudges. Why not stop your carriage, share a mat of grass, and walk together? Walk together, but let the elder go first.\n\nLet those who come, come; let those who go, go—each to their place of rebirth. I extend the kindness of warmth and fullness; you dispel the state of freezing and starvation. The divine lamps shine like the sun, their light witnessed by all in heaven. The Dharma-water rains down like a shower, its moisture universally bestowed upon the void. Cultivate these merits to build this bridge.\n\nTake each other by the hand and ascend the jade steps—whether to advance or linger, whether to hasten or delay. Inscribe your names in the Golden Register—who will be first, and who will follow? For now, act as the King of Equality and attend the Unobstructed Assembly.\n\nLet this proclamation be issued without clamor.\n\nThus posted.\n\nAmidst the boundless expanse of layered gates, in the endless night’s profound obscurity, before recounting the thousandfold vastness, let us first speak of the six realms’ boundless expanse. The Four Formless Realms remain formless, yet their emptiness is but delusion. The Three Realms’ sentient beings never escape illusion’s transformations. The oranges’ playful elephants—are they free from deceit’s guile? The lotus’s lingering rings—can they sever the longing of affection’s thoughts?\n\nAcross all dharma-realms, those called celestial immortals still possess human hearts—how much more so the spirits of the Dao. Ancient sites in mountains and rivers, sacred altars and spirit shrines: when bells resound and apes cry, the plain temple is revered above the Southern Marchmount. The stone engraved with the iron horse’s dream—did it not fulfill the \"Yellow Ox’s\" prophecy? Though called divine powers, they still crave blood offerings.\n\nAmong those with eyes and ears, who willingly lends their sight and hearing? Among those with mouths and bodies, who willingly endures hunger and cold? Do they not take each step in thought, free from desire? Those who returned jade to their lords—where is that jade now? Those who died presenting their kingdoms—how foolish were those kingdoms! The horse of Chaoyang would not advance, though eight thousand *li* lay ahead. The paper of the sea would not nurture, though nineteen years passed in reckoning. Spears were not yet rested when spears were lost; oars were not yet struck when oars vanished.\n\nThough souls and spirits do not rot like deadwood, fame and merit are but empty blossoms. Some care not for wealth and rank, some shut their ears to right and wrong—rinsing in streams, resting on stones, angling for the moon, plowing the clouds. The elixir crucible remains, yet its furnace smoke has turned to ash. The meditation cell endures, yet its skeletal image has crumbled to dust.\n\nThen there are the nine schools—physicians and diviners—and the hundred arts—actors and entertainers: those who mock dwarfs escape not Confucius’ condemnation; those who take sorcerers as omens avoid not Duke Mu’s folly. Risking life on perilous poles and leaping swords, gambling existence on danger. Divining with turtle shells and casting tiles—why not heed their own omens? Scheming with traps and snares—why rely on force? Competing for profit with brush and coin—how does it compare to boats and carts?\n\nThough born alike, who knows how death differs? Some face battle and sacrifice themselves for their country: tongues may sever, yet eyes still glare; entrails may be devoured, yet bodies do not yield. The flames on Yan Mountain blaze fiercely—not for one snake alone. The waters of Miluo River surge boundlessly—not to stand apart from the crowd. The crow, unaware of fleeing, met its minced fate here. Without distinguishing suspicion, this scale led to its boiling. Those who imitated the bear’s roar—had their plans exhausted. Those who captured snakes—few remained.\n\nWealth harms the self; boasting of gold’s abundance is vain. Beauty injures the body; the sorrow of moth-eyebrows is futile. All flows on thus—what words remain? Alas, you multitudes, failing to find your place of rebirth, why enter the realm of death without guilt?\n\nAs for those who gape awaiting food—shame on their bloated bellies. Those naked and bare—deeply ashamed of their tattered quilted robes. Mouths shrunken—worse than a crow’s peck. Necks elongated—nearly like a crane’s form. The women of Xia Mountain often awaken as apes. The villagers of Fu Village—how did they transform into tigers? Some born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation; some clad in scales, armor, or feathers. Though lacking human hearts, they possess hearts turned toward the Dao—these are the ghostly and beastly realms.\n\nAll you named and nameless kinds, mastered and masterless souls—why have you come? There is reason. Do not let the low surpass the noble, the distant surpass the close. Do not let the strong bully the weak, the many oppress the solitary. Rather, like fish moistening one another with foam, do not imitate beasts that fight when cornered.\n\nThe Southern and Northern Seas—are their customs truly so different? The people of Qin and Yue—are their hearts not equally sorrowful? When punishments are discussed, even strangers meet as new friends. Act now as the King of Equality and attend the Universal Salvation Assembly. To be clothed and fed—is this not joy? To be joyful—is this not delight? To bathe virtue and cleanse the body—is this not purity? To advance—is this not progress? To ascend the Dao’s shore, to climb the immortal steps—these are no empty words. Each should listen carefully.\n\nThus posted.\n\n**Notice for Wandering Souls**\n\nWhat makes humans spiritually superior to all things? Knowing heaven and earth’s nurturing power, they must also feel the sorrow of frost and dew. How does creation bring forth all beings? Though it shows no favor in sun and moon’s illumination, can it lack the thunder’s wrathful might?\n\nToday, the Daoist Liang, in reverence, recalls his father’s labor in building the house, cherishes his grandfather’s sharing of sweetness, his grandmother’s nurturing kindness yet unrepayed, his great-uncle’s exhorting words not forgotten. Recently, at the White Water Plain, he consulted the Green Crow divination to arrange burial rites, expressing filial devotion and pledging posthumous cultivation to bestow blessings. Unforeseen, this day has come—fearing to betray that earlier vow, he respectfully chooses this season of orange and tangerine, offering simple sacrifices of grain and fruit.\n\nHe respectfully invites the officiating officials to array solemn dignity, first purifying the sacred altar, then summoning the underworld. As for the rebellious dogs, stubborn and fierce, harboring treacherous schemes, embodying inauspicious omens and malevolent hearts—those who stealthily spy on lofty walls like rats, or presumptuously peer at grand tunnels like mantises, unaware of departure or approach, as foolish as dull steeds—let the multitude’s wrath brook no tolerance. The divine might blazes forth; relying on the Mysterious Law, they are delivered to the Demon-Quelling Star.\n\nAs for the pitiable wandering souls, the forsaken lingering spirits—having come to this assembly, what will you do in this hall? Form joyful bonds; do not harbor notions of self and other. Past enmities—let them all be resolved. Today’s heartfelt words—let them be briefly exchanged. Whether once old friends or neighbors bound by trust, whether decaying with orchids or enduring like metal and stone—use this to plan for yourselves; I will not betray your hopes.\n\nHungry ones—provide them food; why remain gaunt and self-aware?\nCold ones—clothe them; let none stand naked at my side.\nWith the waters of Canglang, wash your feet.\nWith the purest of springs, cleanse your hearts.\nMay you awaken and ascend, while the myriad beings, lost in delusion, stumble and fall.\nStep upon the jade stairs, where clouds rise in towering peaks, and gaze afar at the radiance of the golden palaces.\nThe immortal source stretches boundless—is not the journey forward a joy?\nBy this decree, let all take heed.\n\nMoreover, the forms of yang and the statutes of yin—originally no different in law, for they stem from the same source.\nHeaven and hell—how far apart are they? The difference lies not beyond the span of a heart.\nDaoist schools speak of their existence;\nthe discourse of the noble declares their absence.\nToday, the female disciple of the Dao, so-and-so, grieving for the Old Lord so-and-so, whose life and death follow their appointed time—no untended carbuncle goes unhealed—yet on the dark paths of the netherworld, she remains troubled by idle words.\nWithout the aid of incense and cultivation, how can liberation be attained?\nThus, she invokes the Supervisor of the Fast, the Valiant General of the Straight Price, the hounds and falcons, bidding them trace the path and point the way.\nLet malevolent foxes and wicked crows take flight and soar far away; let the moon’s clarity dispel the lingering miasma.\nAbove, let it reach the Three Realms; below, let it descend to the Nine Springs.\nAll imprisoned souls—look up and obey this decree of amnesty.\nDemand their bonds from the Ox-Head jailers; let no venomous harm arise, as from a wolf’s wild heart.\nThe punishments of grinding pestles, boiling cauldrons, and scorching fires—what code prescribes them?\nThe tortures of fire beds and iron registers—what scripture records them?\nKneeling, they find no ground to voice their grievances; crying out, they see no path to heaven.\nLet all be released without delay; none shall be detained.\nLet lingering spirits, forsaken souls, the beings of the Four Births and Six Paths—all gather at this Dharma assembly to forge good karma together.\nDo not let the lowly envy the noble, nor the strong bully the weak.\nDo not divide self from other, for how can I alone escape?\nDo not let north remain north and south remain south, never to meet.\nLet joy abound—those near rejoice, those far draw close.\nCome with light hearts: the first call, the last respond.\nShoulder to shoulder, they laugh and speak; hand in hand, they sing and chant.\nLet each arise in compassion—this is called equality.\nWash your cap-strings in purity or your feet in filth—who can speak of the world as a muddy mire?\nFeed the hungry, clothe the cold—was the vow of a lifetime ever merely for warmth and sustenance?\nHaving returned to the Great Dao, one may inquire of the art of living.\nEmerging from the gates of the dead, you cross into my realm.\nThe time is now—do not let it slip; how can you fail to seize this moment of celestial celebration?\nO souls, go forth—this path leads to the discourse of the Dao’s emptiness and formlessness.\n\nMoreover—alas!—death is but a return.\nTo return is to return to the Dao.\nThe Dao takes formlessness as its essence.\nDim and silent, vast and obscure—I cannot force a name upon the departed.\nThirty-seven springs and autumns—what stirred the longing to return, only to halt here?\nTracing the cause, there is reason indeed.\nRecently, a woman’s illness did not abate; perhaps swayed by reckless, deluded words, her heart grew troubled, her mind confused.\nBewildered, as if in dream or drunkenness, like scorching winds spreading poison, like barbarian mists burying all in dust.\nShe turned back, yet unexpectedly, the twin demons of illness struck at her vital essence.\nWith the woman’s untimely death, her grief and lament deepened the abyss—thus, no remedy could prevail.\nThe spirit realm offered no response; beyond Yellow Mound Mountain, her destination remained unknown.\nDarkness gave way to light in the blink of five days.\nDay after day, month after month—ever more distant.\nWithout the power of the Dao, who would guide her delusion and lead her to this return?\nFrost chills the moon, a lone crow cries mournfully—at this moment, in this sorrow, what will you become?\nThough endowed with the vigor of heroes, though your heart be as wood or stone, how can you remain unmoved by the sighs of orphaned children and widowed wives?\nYou must awaken compassion, bear witness to devotion, guard and shield, and never indulge in wayward paths that breed defilement.\nLet the departed soul return to the Dao—no greater merit exists.\nAs for the paths of heaven, humanity, spirits, the Dao, hell, ghosts, and beasts—desolate and distant, bound to the Dao—\nseen, they have no form; heard, they make no sound.\nYet why must you cling to thoughts of greed, anger, and delusion, to the worldly pursuits of the mortal realm?\nHaving come here, what will you do?\nClothe yourselves in these robes—no more cries of cold.\n\nFeed, and you shall be fed—no more wails of hunger.\nFrom this moment forth, may you awaken to understanding.\nThe East cannot be relied upon; the South cannot be your abode.\nThe West’s shifting sands, the North’s flying snow—none can be dwelt in long.\nHow can you not turn your heart toward the Dao?\n\nMay you, the departed spirits, together ascend the shore of the Dao.\nEven the joy of wind-dancing in the rain-altars cannot surpass this.\nKnow this.\n\nThus, the proclamation is posted.\n\nMoreover:\nLife and death are the constant of day and night, stretching from ancient past to present without end.\nGhosts and spirits follow the Dao of yin and yang, sighing at the boundless cycle of beginning and end.\nYet from a single thought of good or evil arises the divergence of suffering and bliss along two paths.\nDeluded in mind, ignorant of principle, they chase shadows and lose the true.\nFortunate to encounter this sagely age, where rites of universal deliverance are established,\nwhere the profound teachings of the Dao are expounded,\nwhere reverence for ancestors is displayed,\nand where the benevolence of aiding and saving is magnified.\nSuch great virtue as this is rarely met.\n\nYou wandering souls, adrift in the hidden traces of the netherworld,\nlingering in the long night—\nthough your sorrows are myriad and vast,\nknow that the Six Paths stretch boundlessly before you.\nThose who cling to delusion are ensnared by things and burdened by them.\nThose entangled in attachments bear the weight of form upon form.\nSunk in the dark and desolate paths, cast into realms of desolation and chill,\nsome wail beneath the stars and moon,\nsome howl amid wind and rain.\nUnheard by those who mourn and offer sacrifices,\nunclaimed even in burial—\nat the ends of the earth, to whom can you turn for refuge?\nBeneath the slanting sun over fragrant grasses, you long in vain for home.\nTo speak of this is to feel deep sorrow and compassion.\n\nYet by the golden register rites performed in the light,\nthe Supreme Lord opens the cinnabar mausoleum of the Dao,\nrevealing the wondrous Dharma of rebirth for you,\nbestowing the good cause of deliverance from death.\nCleanse your thoughts, purify your hearts,\nand all shall heed the precepts of the Nine Perfected.\nWarm your robes, fill your bellies,\nand together escape the afflictions of the Five Sufferings.\nForever attain freedom, with no more entanglements.\n\nThus, the proclamation is posted.\n*End of Scroll Eleven of Xu Xian’s Literary Works*\n\n**Scroll Twelve of Xu Xian’s Literary Works**\n\n**Memorial for the Restoration of Lingji Palace**\nWe observe that the construction of this palace has proceeded for six years. Recently, the eastern pond has dried up entirely, no longer offering the joy of divine and mortal communion. The roof lacks over ten thousand tiles. Those near and far who seek the spirits’ favor have voiced no small distress—surely none lack the heart to give generously.\n\nWe recall that building a house takes three years, yet still invites the criticism of passersby. A mountain built to nine *ren* may yet be undone by a single basket’s shortfall. Our Perfected One is both enlightened and efficacious. Let all of like mind remain steadfast to the end as at the beginning. Though this palace nears completion, the eastern pond’s desiccation gives cause for concern, and the western inscription shames us with thoughts of leaking roofs.\n\nAll around, in the ten directions, are benefactors. Above, within three feet, divine presences watch over us. Do not say that sweet wine is not offered in thatched halls—after libations, perhaps cassia wood may yet mend the medicine chest. The sum still lacking is precisely what is needed. Thus, we make our plea.\n\nTo count grains of rice before cooking betrays the narrowness of our own vision. To donate a million in wealth reveals the heart of a true elder. Since this is a plea for divine favor, why not give with joy? Let none hesitate in their generosity.\n\n**Memorial for the Construction of the Divine Kitchen**\nLong has the stone statue of Xu stood as a folk shrine—what is this if not a thousand years of virtuous governance? When Magistrate Chen wished to oversee the local altar, he sought to etch his name for ten thousand generations. His intent was not in the butchery of offerings but in the solemnity of sacrifice.\n\nThe new temple stands grand, a majestic sight in the land. Yet the old kitchen, exposed to wind and rain, totters on four crumbling walls. Though rise and fall follow destiny, creation lies in human hands. Once, we built by the roadside; now, we raise beams with purpose. Through the counsel of the worthy, the divine kitchen is complete.\n\nHow splendid! How magnificent! Soon, its grandeur will be fully revealed. Here, the distant may drink; here, they may feast. Thus, the temple’s majesty shall be restored.\n\n**Memorial for the Construction of the Hall of Remnant Blessings**\nWe recall that the five aggregates are empty—who perceives the three thousand great worlds? All buddhas arise from the work of the mind. To accumulate goodness is to build the Hall of Remnant Blessings, exhorting others to do the same. This blessed land is a pure realm indeed.\n\nWe have seen that in the first year of the Xinglong era, this luminous pavilion was raised, yet it lacked the Zhongtong paper currency. Those who gave willingly found the Buddha’s witness. In this life, we forge karmic bonds for this life—even a single coin carries its own merit.\n\nAxes fell trees, saws shape them; tiles must be broken, walls painted. Through diligent effort, we await the day bricks are polished into mirrors. With this humble memorial, we knock upon the gates of the noble.\n\n**Memorial for the Construction of the Hall of Remnant Blessings, Requesting Monks as Fundraisers**\nWe recall the thousand hundred million transformation bodies, each dust-mote realm attaining buddhahood. In the ten directions, every land is a bodhimandala. Do not dismiss what is seen as weightier than what is heard—one must act here to achieve there. All beings may be liberated, yet one must not forget one’s native soil.\n\nOur great master was once the monk of Ao Peak. The Hall of Remnant Blessings has long held the incense of Hu Rock—whether form or formless, it meets the conditions for enlightenment. Through exhortation and alms-seeking, we have gained the aid of celestial musicians.\n\nHaving already hung lamps and tempered the arm, why shrink from cutting flesh or offering the body? Let us repair the eastern wall and western wall, lest wind and rain intrude. The scale shall be grand, the renewal complete. From beginning to end, it shall be a boundless field of merit.\n\nHenceforth, let this karmic bond be fulfilled.\n\n**Memorial for the Construction of the Hall of Remnant Blessings**\nWe recall the alms-seeking across the ten directions—from the southern continent to the northern, years of cultivation. From the eastern land to the western, all are seeds of the Buddha. Do not bark at the old bhikṣu for finding it hard to beg—know that resolve makes deeds easy.\n\nThe elder scatters gold, known as the great *āraṇya*. The Hall of Accumulated Goodness and the Hall of Remnant Blessings are the bodhimandala of Dingguang Yuan. We must establish present and future causes and effects. From this point onward, renewal is our aim.\n\nVows as deep as cranes’ crowns and reeds’ knees. Beams like phoenixes, eaves like halos—how grand the scale! Thirty thousand loads of earth, great the expense. Thousands of donors, vast the merit.\n\nMany have cast forth their treasures, bursting the bag of illusions. No longer shaken by wind and rain, even dragons and devas praise this work. With this humble memorial, we knock upon the gates of the noble, awakening the bodhi-mind—great compassion, great joy, great giving. Countless are the marks of virtue and fortune, boundless and immeasurable.\n\nFrom beginning to end, may it be completed. With raised hands and lifted brows, we shall gaze upon it in reverence.\n\n**Memorial for the Restoration of Ciji Palace**\nWe recall the stored essence of the Bohai Sea, manifesting the thirty-two marks of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva. In Tongcheng, the incense of Ciji has burned for over two hundred years. Wherever it is established, the name remains the same.\n\nThis hall, now ruined and fallen—is its restoration in earth and timber difficult or easy? We look to the thousand benefactors for witness. Let not the mendicant’s vows be in vain; even a single tile or beam’s aid is welcome.\n\nFortunately, there is no division between this and that realm—let us forge bonds with ten thousand people. Meeting from a thousand *li*, let all give with joy, and it shall be completed this very day.\n\nPhoenixes soar, halos fly—how grand the scale shall be! Cocks crow, dogs bark—may the teachings spread far and wide. This is the transformation of black cloth into silk, the return of auspicious omens once lost.\n\nThrough this offering, may it serve as a bridge across the sea of suffering. The merit is beyond measure, the karmic fruit beyond thought. Gold scattered upon the earth—we have heard of Sudatta’s path to buddhahood. Incense burned to heaven—may we emulate the blessings Hua Feng offered to the sage.\n\nWith this humble memorial, we knock upon the gates of the noble.\n\n**Memorial for the Reconstruction of Wenxing Hermitage, Including Fundraising and Poetry Competitions**\nWe recall that Wenxing Hermitage plans to raise beams—its rise and fall are fated. A thatched hall cannot be a painted cake; without the right people, nothing can be achieved.\n\nThough honored by your gracious presence, I have been remiss in offering proper hospitality—may Heaven and Earth bear witness to this heart.\n\nFine days and fair scenes, rare since ancient times, are now ours to share. Reopening the old shop, let us all share a smile. From all four directions, patrons of old return. Say not that this second coming costs no coin.\n\nWhat is right today may have been wrong before—yet once a matter has passed, let no blame remain. Neither ill-willed nor unkind, may we meet anew as if for the first time. No empty promises shall be made; only progress sought.\n\n**Memorial for the Restoration of Qilong Temple at Aofeng**\nWe recall that Qilong Mountain, where banners flutter, holds a true dragon’s lair—its paths winding, peaks circling. To fish from the turtle’s head, one must first claim its crown; where earth is sacred, men are noble.\n\nThough the grove lies shadowed, an ancient temple stands solemn still. For generations, this land has known blood offerings and incense smoke. Yet long has it lain in ruin—its rise and fall fated. Now, renewal is our aim, the divination auspicious.\n\nPhoenixes take flight in radiant splendor, yet we seek no excess. Cocks crow, dogs bark—we glimpse the signs of peace. Gods and men rejoice alike; village and shrine rest in harmony.\n\nPlans are made in unison, but strength must be shared. To raise even a single beam is no task for one timber alone. Beneath the shade of mulberry and catalpa, who would withhold aid? From the great households, middling ones, and humble alike—let each offer what they can.\n\nInscribe it boldly, repeatedly, without fear of ink. Let many copies of *Zhiyuan* be displayed, that we may await Heaven’s blessings of peace and prosperity.\n\n**Memorial for the Restoration of the Boundary Bridge**\nWe recall that this bridge, standing for three hundred years, now crumbles—its fate inescapable. In the eleventh month, a temporary crossing was built; the people, unburdened, pledged their hearts.\n\nYet we must rely on the vows of elders, the surplus grain of monks, the spare wealth of donors—these will ensure lasting sufficiency. To cultivate good roots is to honor good fruits; such is the principle we follow.\n\nNot for fame or profit, but to seize the moment. Travelers shall pass without peril, and descendants know boundless blessings.\n\n**Memorial for Bridge Repairs and Fundraising by Lottery**\nWe recall the vast labor of mending western walls and eastern partitions. First the lesser, then the greater—let accounts of wealth and righteousness be clear.\n\nEmpty words avail nothing; only capital yields profit. A clever wife without flour cannot make even a simple cake. You have tasted the pear—now, in this time of peace, why refuse the passing note?\n\nThirty lots, no burden to carry, bought and matched in an instant. The first prize, truly refined, wins all acclaim in the poetry contest. Drawn by chance, some gain favor. Witnessed by kin, none dare act carelessly.\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nPresent matters are neither false nor deceitful. Wealth in the world is ever in use and ever abundant. A thousand-character text bears a thousand-character mark—mutual agreement binds all. Among ten thousand people, ten thousand connections are made, and merit is fulfilled.\n\nCasual village speech may stir the hearts of the young.\n\n**Memorial for Road Repairs**\nWe recall the post road where travelers come and go, this thoroughfare spanning ten thousand li. The pagoda and bridge stand but a short distance apart, yet they mark the vital junction between two villages. Recently, floodwaters have risen, turning level paths perilous. Though all wish to do good, none can act alone. If we do not plan now, fertile fields may once more become seas—accumulation begins with small steps. Stone upon stone can form a mountain. In this time of peace, why refuse the passing note?\n\nThanks to the building of dikes, no detours will be needed. By joining in collective causes, we mend this shared ground. A steady step forward—this is the first stage on the road to the capital.\n\n**Memorial for Dike Repairs**\nWe recall that where water has embankments, floods cause no harm. Where fields know neither drought nor deluge, abundant harvests may be expected—though mountains and valleys shift over time. Years have passed, and the balance of yin and yang has faltered, leaving many lingering ills.\n\nNow we propose to rebuild the dike, restoring the old watercourse. Ten thousand oxen may haul the stone, but only thus can the waters be held back. Baskets of earth piled high will form a barrier strong enough to defend. Though we follow the land’s contours with wisdom, we must also contribute wealth and labor.\n\nLet neither landlord nor tenant make distinctions—together, we secure blessings for generations to come. We humbly request your brush to set these words to paper, that contributions may rise like clouds.\n\nWhat flows east must first flow west. What is done above will be mirrored below. To channel the Jing into the Wei, one must not shirk labor. To dredge the Huai and clear the Si, there is indeed a Way. Success is certain—granaries will overflow, and storehouses brim. The blessings are many: first wealth, then longevity.\n\n**Memorial for Establishing a Merit-Gathering Ritual**\nWe recall that in the great Ming, under Heaven’s mandate, all who accumulate goodness receive the five blessings of peace. Now, in this age of prosperity, in towns and villages alike, let us together achieve good karma, each awakening to the task.\n\nNobles and commoners alike, we humbly request your great brushes. May abundant virtue and power be bestowed. As the people observe the three-month repentance rituals, may four seasons of fortune gather—may the aged flourish, may all prosper.\n\n**Memorial for Prayers and Exorcism**\nWe recall that when baleful qi recedes and auspicious qi harmonizes, disaster is averted and hardship resolved. The Dao of Heaven is distant, but the Dao of humanity is near—thus we seek favor through offerings.\n\nFor the moment a thought arises, the gods take note—yet how can deeds be without consequence? The finest incense is not native to this soil. Wax candles and bright lamps may borrow light from neighbors. Let us uphold the peace of our village and hear the music of a well-ordered age.\n\nTherefore, the noble-minded anticipate misfortune and take precautions. Do not dismiss minor ills as harmless—pray for their removal. In us lies hidden virtue from Heaven.\n\nWe pray that the sounds of crowing roosters and barking dogs reach all four borders, that the blessings of the *Hongfan* and *Guizhou* be bestowed upon the people. How could there not be ample grace?\n\nIf goodness exists but is not acted upon, what use is it?\n\n**Memorial for Celebrating the Five Manifestations and the Buddha’s Birthday**\nWe recall that when a single Buddha appears in the world, all generations revere him. The three realms, filled with spirits, gather for the assembly of the Five Perfections. Ten thousand gods rejoice, and the four seas look to him in reverence.\n\nWe honor the Buddha’s station: through three asaṃkhyeya kalpas, he cultivated merit across ten lifetimes. On the eighth day of the fourth month, the *mingyú* plant blooms with auspiciousness, bestowing blessings from the nine heavens. Once more, the *udumbara* flower appears in splendor. With hands raised to heaven and earth, he vowed to deliver both saints and mortals.\n\nWe, your humble servants, owe boundless gratitude, for we know the source of our blessings. Whether registered households or water-dwellers, though the six senses and six desires remain unmastered, once a year we offer thanks. We prepare pure offerings, invite the World-Honored One, and bear witness together in awakening.\n\nWe pray that the Tathāgata may manifest—neither defiled nor pure, neither extinguished nor born. May all blessings reach the people—may they live long, prosper, flourish, and thrive.\n\n**Memorial for the Blood Bowl Ritual**\nWe recall that women, with their five leakages, endure hardship in bearing and raising children. A mother’s tenfold kindness cannot be repaid, even if one were to grind one’s bones to dust. Some mothers are still living yet lack proper care; others have passed, their merits unfulfilled. How can we not reflect on this? Let us return to the root.\n\nAs children, we must recognize the bonds of heaven and earth. By the true person’s wisdom and the Supreme’s expedient means, we establish the Blood Bowl Assembly. Following the repentance rites, we perform the twofold ritual—benefiting both the living and the departed, broadly delivering all beings.\n\nThe Savior from Suffering, the Heavenly Worthy, is none other than the compassionate patron. Do not dismiss this as unrelated to monks and Daoists. The Tathāgata Śākyamuni declared himself the reincarnation of Laozi—his merits are inconceivable.\n\nThere is no evil in that realm, nor weariness in this. Without concern for gain or accomplishment, we build this bridge, that all may cross and receive its seal as proof. May all turn in reverence, and may every assembly be complete.\n\nFrom the Floating Black Soil emerges a pearl of millet, no farther than five *zhang* away. The Feathered State’s pond transforms into a lotus throne, ever present within the heart’s square inch.\n\nTo express sincerity, we humbly submit this account.\n\n**Memorial for the Daoist Master’s Enthronement in the Luo Tian Jiao Ritual**\nWe recall the imperial decree of jade, bestowing honor upon the master. Two silver seals—what joy to receive such imperial favor! Never before has this been seen; today, we witness it.\n\nThough will can pierce stone, the body feels light while the feet grow heavy. Reborn, one is not worth half a coin. Yet we hear that good deeds multiply—why not pray for blessings like those of the Kaiyuan era, when bells were cast?\n\nLet no restraint be placed upon the Zhongtong-era literary drafts, that they may ever exist and ever endure, bringing all things to their proper beginning and end. I shall strive to ascend the pole’s summit, while you need not forge iron to serve as a threshold.\n\nBack and forth across two thousand *li* of roads, this karmic affinity is no mere chance. Up and down through seven or eight years, this merit surpasses all former merit. If a virtuous thought arises, let joyful heart follow.\n\n**Memorial for the Daoist Master’s Investiture of the Immortal’s Tablet**\nWe humbly observe that the Perfected One of Numinous Aid has received the Celestial Master’s provincial document, graced with imperial favor, bestowed a noble title, and exalted in incense and devotion. Though the matters be vast, the rites must not be lacking. With this humble memorial, we reverently knock upon the gates of the lofty, praying that this opportunity of karmic affinity be fulfilled—thus shall boundless merit be attained.\n\nFor four hundred years, the temple’s offerings have endured. Mount Ao’s numinous manifestations, the celestial seal of sixteen characters, and the phoenix-script forming its chapters—all evoke the sighs of yellow-haired children and white-haired elders, the reverence of officials and gentlemen. Joy abounds, and multitudes come forth. Thus we extend our sincerest entreaty, for who could doubt the efficacy of seeking the divine?\n\nHalf the face, all familiar—yet at the first word, speech falters. This affinity cannot be without cost.\nThe Dragon-Tiger blessed land lies no less than twenty stages away. Musk and rare incense are no mere pinch of dust.\nTo seek affairs beyond heaven, one must spend wealth of the world.\nThose who have set their hearts, and those who have not—each must regard with true sincerity.\nWhen the hand is ready to extend, let it extend; laugh at those who hesitate and falter.\nWe dare not demand beyond what is due, yet neither shall we let past opportunities pass again.\nWe pray that names inscribed may ascend the Buddha’s pagoda, rising layer upon layer, ever higher.\nGazing upon the sacred, emulating the divine—Mount Song’s majesty—we call ten thousand years, ten thousand years, and again ten thousand years.\nBelow, we cultivate human affairs; above, we repay the nation’s grace.\nThough these humble words lack refinement, let them not be refused on account of their plainness.\n\nMoreover:\nAt the outset of affairs, all follow with eager steps. Yet when faced with wealth, some falter in speech, hesitating to speak.\nThe glory of this document shines resplendent, revered as if the divine stood at our side.\nWho lacks joyful intent? Each harbors a heart of offering.\nThough past contributions were not few, they were spent as swiftly as they came.\nIf the plea for alms cannot be repeated, with whom shall we consult? Why have we come, if not for this? The urgency is plain.\nThose who once pledged must not betray their word. Those who now inscribe need not speak of later regrets.\nWhen good deeds are completed, all blessings shall follow.\n\nThe Daoist Liao, who befriended Han Yu, learned goodness from others.\nMengchang Jun was not reproached by Feng Huan—no debt shall remain unpaid.\n\n**Memorial for the Celestial Master’s Bestowal of Registers and Establishment of the Jiao Ritual**\nTo ward off disaster and repel calamity is the unerring duty of the divine.\nUpright and enlightened, seeking blessings and invoking favor—this is the common desire of all.\nThough the Creator leaves no trace, the Dao’s methods hold their own karmic affinity.\nReverently, for the Numinous Aid Perfected, we receive the Great Cavern’s precious registers—above, to announce to heaven and invoke the sage; below, to protect the nation and pacify the people.\nWe must rely on rites to dispel demons and guard the true, paving the path to attaining the Dao and ascending to perfection.\nGreat virtue cannot be surpassed; the common folk, too, shall benefit.\nThe dragon steeds’ saddles remain secure; their gallop unerring.\nBreaking reeds for rafts, the cost reaches a hundred thousand.\nBlack oxen and yellow calves, each abide in their tasks.\nMay the Nine Virtues of the Great Norm be fulfilled, and the blessings of the Nine-Five sovereign descend.\nLet all pour forth their hearts to accomplish this good work.\n\n**Memorial for the Sculpting of the Perfected’s Return to the Dao’s Attire**\nWe reverently observe that the Numinous Aid Perfected, having ascended to immortality, must be adorned in immortal raiment.\nOf old, the robe and tablet were the state’s favor; now, boots and bamboo hat suit the times.\nNeither can be discarded—let both be preserved. Yet neither can remain unchanged; thus, we establish a new hall within.\nTo sculpt the image of the Dark Sage is to embody the Dao itself.\nA crown of azure clouds, a fan of soaring feathers—blending the true form, no human effort alone could achieve this.\nShould there be benefactors moved to assist, their merit shall be beyond measure.\nOnce, in the Yuan and Ming, the true body manifested, its purple-golden form witnessed by all.\nIn an instant, it vanished without trace. Why cling to a clay semblance? Yet in adorning the spirit to resemble the spirit, it must meet the mark.\nOf old, serving in Jin, he wore the robes of Liang’s favor. Now, enshrined in Lu, he dons the cap of Zhang Fu.\nThough imitating the fashions of the age, he cannot escape external judgment.\nHaving received heaven’s favor, his attire must accord with the Nine Chapters.\nThis requires human contribution—could it be without cost? Let benefactors and patrons each bring forth treasures, pledging their hearts to accomplish this.\nThe merit shall be great. Reverence lies herein, not in mere appearances.\nWe reverently pray for the present emperor’s longevity, equal to heaven’s.\nMay all under heaven bow to the imperial crown, and the myriad lands offer tribute.\nMay the hundred barbarians don robes and sashes.\n\n**Memorial for the Sculpting of the Divine Image at Qingkou**\nThe two peaks stand majestic; of old, Mount Ao claimed six lands, gazed upon by all four directions.\nNow, the new mound at Qingkou is dismissed as a humble shrine. Yet the divine, vast in power, remains indestructible in true form—this image is but clay, shaped by human hands.\nEmpty words suffice not; let donations be recorded to clarify.\nConsider the artisans—no two possess the same skill. Having stepped forward, let them extend their hands.\nAll who tend the incense and flame are disciples—let none speak of great or small.\nAt the ripening of the rice harvest, we shall surely see sevenfold, eightfold abundance.\nThough these words are coarse and unrefined, let the good work be completed.\n\n**Memorial for Robes and Attire**\nThe divine is the people’s lord—how could it not think of them?\nClothing is the body’s adornment; it must befit its wearer.\nMoreover, the Numinous Aid Temple is known as the shrine of the upright god—its patched robes are unseemly.\nZixia’s shame at his frayed sleeves deeply shamed Confucius’ sageliness.\nThe years have passed—why not renew the boots and bamboo hat?\nCircumstances demand it; let none say the cap and shoes are misplaced.\nIn times of war, millet and beans are set aside; sable and cicada ornaments come from the mirror’s reflection.\nAdapting to the times—who could say it is wrong?\nWe have disciples with whom to speak; let great benefactors arise with joyful hearts.\nA hundred expenses are not easily met—a single coin is still an offering.\nEvery stitch and thread requires effort. Gathering fur makes a fur coat—let all contribute their strength.\nWith the five colors displayed, may abundant blessings extend to the multitudes.\n\n**Moreover:**\nCrimson shoes and star-crowned caps, bowing to the Han gods.\nThe Celestial Master’s favor—Zhang Fu’s cap and Confucian robes.\nThis is no land of Yue; to imitate foreign dress would be to don outlandish garb.\nAshamed of the worn, quilted robe, we seek brocade to cover it.\nWhy wait for cold to seek furs? Let us play our part as the scene demands.\nThough a hundred holes and a thousand tears cannot be mended, a thousand stitches and ten thousand threads still require effort.\n\n\"To say it comes again is not worth a single coin.\nThis time, a [missing character]—how could it be for great expense?\nSince it is neither ghostly tribute nor heavenly rain, let it bring joy to gods and delight to men.\nMoreover, in this year of joyous counsel and abundant harvest, why empty the mushroom stores or overturn the granaries? How could we follow the waves of others?\nWe must dust our caps and straighten our robes—blessings never tire of cultivation, and words leave no room for later dispute.\n\n**Memorial on the Replacement of the Perfected One’s Stolen Robes**\n\nProstrating, we, descendants of the Five Dynasties’ marquises and kings, revere integrity as divine and honor our thousand-year parents.\nIn our village, without cause, the sacred headdress was violated. Due to the poor who disregard righteousness, even the virtuous have lost their dignity.\nThey stripped the robes from the seat of honor, stole the implements of incense and flame, daring to deceive in the unseen darkness—calamity follows those who ignore past ruin.\nThough they claim the dead of night knows no witness, they cannot escape the disaster of a single dawn.\nAll who tend this shrine must not bring shame upon the gods.\nLet us unite in a plan to cover the loss; do not惜 the expense of undoing this wrong.\nMay the hopes of the multitude be fulfilled as in the old statutes.\nWith brushstrokes swift as clouds, success shall come in no time.\nLet there be awe-inspiring might and a model worthy of emulation—gazing upon it, none shall forget.\nHe who accumulates good meets with fortune; he who accumulates evil meets with misfortune—retribution never fails.\n\n*Xu Xian’s Florilegium, Scroll Twelve Concluded*\n*Xu Xian’s Florilegium, Scroll Thirteen*\"\n\n**A Letter to Lord Dongcun**\n\nThe gods manifest their presence, proclaiming themselves through writings. Yet I, unworthy, cannot compose verses like those for the zither-playing spirit of Xiang, nor dare I presume to expound on the *Yi* as one buried in a tomb. My leaky roof brings shame, and my well-bound view leaves me ignorant. Though I may possess a single scrap of foolish insight, it remains beneath even the lowest of the Three Histories. Now, having been judged in the monthly critiques, I pray you will not fault me as the *Spring and Autumn* does.\n\nThe illustrious title of Lingji has endured over four hundred years, its transmission long unbroken. Master Tongzhen underwent ninety-four transformations—who dares claim to understand them? Though fame and profit may differ, literary merit naturally invites public consensus. It is only because Heaven does not withhold the Dao and Earth does not hoard its treasures that the Yellow River yields its chart and the Luo River its writings. Knowing the gods’ designs, one acts upon the slightest sign. The sage does not speak of the uncanny, and the nobleman harbors no doubt. Seen, it is invisible; heard, it is silent—without sound or scent. Vast beyond containment, minute beyond division, it transforms and thus endures. In essence, the upright depend on humanity, while fortune and misfortune, regret and shame lie as plain as the palm. The ancients were swayed by the winds, yet they were people of harmony and humility. In this degenerate age, where are the gentlemen of ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame? This too is the concern of those who grieve for the Dao—how could I be merely playing with words?\n\nSince the matter is just, why seek others? Empty words are no match for practicing the Dao. To sacrifice to what is not a ghost is flattery; to fulfill one’s intent without self-deception is true sincerity.\n\nI reverently consider your esteemed self, who unites the manifest and the hidden, delving into the profound and the obscure. Your towering presence stands like a thousand-fathom cliff; your vast qi sweeps away armies with a brushstroke. Long have I admired the talents of the Prince of Teng, and now I rashly replace the request for the Luo Chi Stele with this plea, fearing even Bo Jie might pale in comparison. Fortunately, like Su Zizhan, I dare not refuse outright. Relying on your magnanimity as an elder, I am honored by the elegant verses you bestowed upon my daughter and grandson. With the temple’s renovation, the inscribed stone shall be glorified, becoming a model for all ages and a crown for the four directions.\n\nWords cannot exhaust speech, nor speech exhaust meaning; I merely convey this sentiment in brief. Greatness is called sagely, and sageliness divine. One must repay virtue—pray refine my words, and do not leave them unpolished like a neglected wall.\n\n**A Petition from the Villagers to Lord Dongcun**\n\nThis ancient temple has gathered four hundred years of dust. Now, a new stele of one thousand and eighty characters stands, its grandeur resplendent. Though its prose may be heard, like the Dipper and the Literary Star, its influence does not extend far. A journey of a thousand *li* is still possible—how could I have imagined the separation of Shen and Shang, spanning years? Never did I expect today to renege on my earlier words. Once, I sent a cage of geese, not the brush of Wang Xizhi; now, I offer no roasted meat to summon the Master’s carriage. Without the medicine of your counsel, I can only grope blindly. Yet I trust in your lofty virtue, which does not forget friendship in poverty.\n\nYou have deigned to favor me with fine words, not dismissing the crude as one might reject blue paired with white. I am ashamed of my vulgar speech, which risks confusing purple with vermilion. Permit me to ask: how might I inscribe my gratitude upon the river of your kindness?\n\nI reverently consider your brilliance, which exhausts the workings of creation. Your learning spans heaven and humanity; your writings surge like vast waters, as profound as Han Yu and more majestic than Sima Qian of the Han. Your renown has long been established, and your accolades are many. The Old Man of Stone Islet is no debt collector, and the Woodcutter of the Mountains only knows how to recite poetry. Though you have bestowed the diligence of a letter, I cannot help but cherish the affection of the *tiepao*. If you show kindness to one like me, who would dare forget the source?\n\nI, a latecomer to learning, am ignorant, my childish mind and meager wit adrift in the illusory and indistinct, devoid of radiant and heroic talent. Yet I have already benefited from your nurturing breath and sheltered beneath your canopy. With respect, I arrange these wild geese in formation, reiterating my private plea. Dare I trouble your carriage to grant this heart a fraction of solace?\n\n**A Letter in Reply to Lord Dongcun**\n\nSome ask: The *Record of Lingji Wang* is the king’s own account. If the king has already recorded it, why does he still eagerly seek others? What is his intent?\n\nAmong all things between heaven and earth, none is more numinous than the dragon. Its breath transforms, its wonders unfathomable. Yet what it relies upon to manifest its divinity is the cloud. Without clouds, the dragon cannot display its numinous power. This is the meaning behind my request to you.\n\nWith respect, I write to express my gratitude.\n\nWhen Zhang Lu entered the pass, he was already dead. When Ying Hou was at home, Tao Zhu concealed himself. Though Fan Li changed his name repeatedly, his true visage remained that of Gao and Kui. I know not what books Qi studied, but Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang have transmitted this Dao since antiquity. In haste or turmoil, one must hold fast to it. The subtlest essence lies in grasping the mean—this is the heart behind bequeathing teachings to the world. One must fulfill the rites of honoring parents and serving superiors; for a thousand years, its wonders remain unfathomable. Ninety-four transformations may be heard of, but without form or sound, I dare not answer the questions of ghosts and spirits.\n\nTo take righteousness as profit is not the way of the bandit Zhi. Though I possess only mediocre talent, I harbor a lingering attachment. Though the Three Rivers do not respond, a single phrase suffices to convey understanding. Why have you come? There is a reason.\n\nOne chaste woman shames the wanton crowd; one capped man humbles the topknotted nine. Though this is the way of the world, does it still possess humaneness? Not illuminating the *Great Learning*’s generation of wealth brings deep disgrace to the *Spring and Autumn*’s forthright brush. In this age, who but you could shoulder this task?\n\nThough one may not be human, humanity is not heaven. One must act in accordance with words, and speak in accordance with deeds.\n\nI reverently consider Lord Dongcun, whose virtue bridges the hidden and the manifest, whose Dao spans the obscure and the luminous. On paper, his clouds and mist evoke the structure of Liu’s bones and Yan’s flesh; in his breast, the vast ocean contains nothing but the sentiments of Zhou and the thoughts of Confucius. Thus, he recognizes today’s right as yesterday’s wrong. Never has there been a case where A approves and B disapproves.\n\nA single word carries weight, upheld by the consensus of many. Why seek outward traces when this is already a matter of subtle influence?\n\nLord Beishan has sons, grandsons, and generations beyond. —*Postscript by Lord Xiecun*\n\nI am honored by your fine composition, which brings radiance to our ancestral shrine. Reading it again and again, I am suddenly struck with insight. Truly, this is what is meant by \"whether wise or unwise, the difference is as great as thirty *li*.\" If I were to compare myself to Master Tongchuan, that would be beyond my daring. Yet I shall place your *Dao Inscription* by my seat, so that future visitors to this hall may read these words, envision your person, and—like seeing a tiger’s pelt—know the roar that once shook the mountain forests and made all beasts tremble.\n\n—*Letter from Lord Xiecun*\n\nRecalling the poems you sent in your sleeve, I remember our brief encounter, where I glimpsed but half your refined bearing. Now, entrusted with composing this record, I behold once more your extraordinary presence—fivefold in its brilliance. Though I long to sweep the path before your gate, I have not yet had the chance. To hold the whip as your attendant would be to gaze upon a towering mountain. My heart holds you in deepest esteem; to know you is to meet Jingzhou—just as I have always wished. Not to have encountered the Lord of Lu is simply fate.\n\nI reverently consider Your Honor, the Prefectural Judge, a man of our native district, advanced in years yet blessed with the vitality of Shao, his hidden virtues sustained by divine favor. His mastery of the classics and cultivation of conduct embody the legacy of the Duke of Zhou’s descendants. His wealth enriches the state, surpassing the achievements of Yan Ying and Guan Zhong. His learning and scholarship surpass others, while his official rank is but a secondary matter. Having found joy in the company of Lord Dongcun, why should he not also wander the wilds?\n\nI dare to bow in humble reverence, grateful to have found recognition in this day. The inscription for the shrine is elegant, its thousand words a testament to refinement. Already, it circulates among the people, its praise enduring for generations, all flowing from your breast. This is no mere carved dragon on paper; even my crude and rustic talent cannot grasp the force of your acclaim. The numinous responds, and the village shrine shines with splendor.\n\nA gentleman forgives others’ shortcomings; even the smallest gift carries weight, its intent as light as a goose feather yet spanning a thousand *li*. I humbly present this pair of carp as a token of my diligence. Your words are worth a thousand gold, and in return, I offer this white goose in gratitude. Deeply ashamed of my rough draft, I can only hope for your indulgence. I respectfully command my ink-brush scribe to gaze upon the thousand volumes of history.\n\n—*Letter on Behalf of the Local Community from Lord Xiecun*\n\nHan Zihua was praised by the Duke of Holding the State—this is the honor due a scholar-official of our time. Xie Lingyun never dreamed of Hui Lian; how then could he have composed those sublime lines by the pond? Where there is such a brother, there must be such a spirit. I revere the man, and thus I revere the deity.\n\nYou have deigned to lower yourself to one so unworthy, a great talent bestowing favor. Long have I cherished your humility and virtue, never daring to forget your kindness. All say that the elder brother’s judgment is sound, yet it is truly your guidance that steers us. After three years of offering, I lament my own inadequacy. Even a meager meal, once spoken of by you, gains weight. How dare I borrow a thousand gold? Yet your praise, like the words of a trusted friend, moves me deeply.\n\nI reflect that I have idled in my village, retreating to the mountains. Though poor, I have never changed my countenance. Wherever my gourd bowl has taken me, I have never presumptuously presented my name. Long have I basked in the lingering grace of your river’s bounty, bound as we are by the vines of kinship. Beyond this, I have no other requests, nor do I know what else to do.\n\nI reverently consider you, a man of renowned lineage, a rare talent of our age. Your breast brims with noble aspirations, your brush flows with vast and boundless prose. I am deeply ashamed that my humble gate cannot accommodate a carriage of four horses. I respectfully offer this letter with utmost reverence, though I am unworthy even of its paper and ink.\n\nYour many acts of kindness have long been known, and I have heard of your reputation as a military adjutant. The temple’s renewal is entirely due to the efforts of Governor Yu. This fulfills my wishes, and I offer these words in gratitude.\n\n—*Letter to Commander Zhang*\n\nI prostrate myself in awe, considering how your bold arguments in the court have secured a legacy for a thousand autumns, and how your strategies within the command tent have earned you the enfeoffment of ten thousand households. Your exemplary conduct endures, ensuring prosperity for generations to come. I dare to present my name, seeking an audience before the court. Your humble inquiries are without shame, and the songs of the people attest to your virtue.\n\nI reverently consider Your Honor, the Commander-in-Chief, whose *qi* is vast and unyielding, whose nature embraces benevolence. You govern the people with a parent’s heart and judge affairs with divine clarity. Grievances vanish like thorns cleared from the thicket, while virtuous deeds flourish like sweet pear trees. Your upright governance stands unmatched among the seven prefectures of southern Min. Your noble bearing soars above all, and all gaze upon you as the North Star among men.\n\nYour learning is as deep as the ocean, your scholarship as splendid as the blossoms of the literati. Your brush wields creation itself, conjuring wind and clouds upon the page. Long have I heard of the two peerless talents in your court, and I rejoice in this gathering of shared culture. Your legal acumen rivals that of Cui and Du, still praised to this day. Your critiques of Ou and Yu leave no room for reproach. The gates of your hundred-*li* city stand magnificent, and the thousand-year-old ornamental pillars are renewed.\n\nHow admirable! How excellent! I prostrate myself in reflection: I am but a child from a remote village, born in a thatched hut, yearning to behold the pure light of wind and moon, having once sat in the lingering glow of rivers and streams. Now, in this village of accumulated virtue, there stands an old rain-praying temple, repeatedly blessed with divine responses, known as the Spiritually Efficacious Shrine. Its characters are as large as pecks, boldly inscribed and doubly cherished. The inscription is on every tongue, and gratitude for your virtue must be sung anew. This is a grand affair for all time—who would dare to diminish its legacy?\n\nThese empty formalities in a wooden box are hardly worthy as gifts. May heaven bless and support you with abundant fortune, fulfilling the sincerity of my prayers. With humble shame and heartfelt gratitude, I offer these words.\n\n—*Letter Requesting an Inscription for the Temple Gate from the Surveillance Commissioner*\n\nThe arrival of your carriage in the eight prefectures brings added luster to this blessed land. The Surveillance Bureau, with its solemn governance, extends the protection of heaven itself. I am deeply moved and will never forget this kindness.\n\nI reverently consider Your Honor, the Surveillance Commissioner, a rare talent of our age, a great virtue for our time, whose nature is pure and conduct meticulous. Long has your family been renowned as upright officials in Chengdu. Your heart is upright and your intentions sincere, having personally received the teachings of Master Yichuan. Your lineage has long been praised for its purity, passing down exemplary conduct to your descendants. You uphold the customs of Guān and Luò, making ritual and righteousness the model for Ōu and Mǐn.\n\nYour calligraphy stands unmatched through the ages, your brushwork sweeping away a thousand armies. Lu, Luo, Wang, and Yang are hardly worth mentioning; Ōu, Yu, Chu, and Xue cannot compare.\n\nTruly, your brilliance shines like a beacon, and I humbly submit the sincerity of my earnest devotion.\n\nI reflect with reverence upon myself—a rustic commoner, a humble scholar of the fields, narrow in vision and small in stature, my person attached to ignorance and folly. Yet daring to lift my gaze toward the axe and halberd of your judgment, I venture to present this petition with bowed head.\n\nHere in this village of accumulated virtue stands the ancient Lingji Palace, a sanctuary revered by all the people, where prayers for rain and sunshine have long been answered. I now seek but three characters, though they weigh more than a thousand gold. If you would graciously bestow your wisdom early, my joy would be boundless.\n\nYour Honor’s gate is vast, and I dare once more to present this humble offering, hoping it may reflect even a glimmer of your luminous example. I, a mere well-frog with a child’s understanding, have consulted the oracle again, my ignorance twice over. I can only hope you might deign to consider it, though I cannot fathom the depth of your judgment.\n\nOn behalf of the villagers, I present this petition for the Dao’s flourishing at Lingji Palace:\n\nLingji Palace—what a sacred precinct! A thousand years of incense smoke.\nThe marketplace of blue cloth teems with people; generations of noble lineages gather.\nWith shared devotion, we seek to adorn it.\nMay its august title be honored in the two capitals, its glorious name resound across the four directions.\n\nThe writings of later masters that transform the present—those of Wang, Yang, Lu, and Luo—cannot surpass this. Ascending to transcendence and verifying sagehood, the teachings of Zheng, Qiao, Wo, and Quan—might one yet hear of them? With the heart set on carrying forth Heaven’s transformative work and the vow sworn to benefit beings and aid others, compassion manifests in myriad forms, and merits defy measure.\n\nThe rites of spring sacrifices endure in their observance, yet the duty of morning and evening devotions may lack its proper steward. Thus, through inertia, we have failed to seek out worthy ones. Who, dwelling alone, might deliberate on the Great Harmony? He who takes goodness as his teacher—such as you, sir, a man of aligned resolve and disciplined conduct—commands the collective plea of the multitude, not for my own sake or out of personal favor.\n\nShould you deign to grace us with your presence, the grandeur of the palace gates would shine all the brighter. Again, as iron is transmuted into gold, we rely deeply on your refining power; as a brick cast forth draws forth jade, we bear the weight of your parallel prose. In my recent memorial, I humbly presented a stern simplicity, my gaze fixed on the smallest details, and now, with reverence, I sweep clean my humble abode, awaiting your arrival with hands clasped, ready to receive your radiance with offerings of incense and flowers.\n\nA thousand-year-old marble pillar, home to the swift-returning crane of immortals. A ten-thousand-year Dao sanctuary, a land as majestic as the Six Turtles of antiquity. From all directions, the gaze of the world turns here; by the strength of the many, it is sustained. To manage it, to cultivate it—whose effort is this? From beginning to end, though it be my heart, it is the heart of the villagers. Yet I fear this flourishing may not long endure, and so, with earnest devotion, I make this plea.\n\nHuman sentiment is thorough: they say the plum blossoms by the stream are worth a thousand gold. To see this good work completed would surpass even the wealth of Yangzhou’s ten thousand taels. I humbly request that the High Master Tang Zong establish ten thousand assemblies to assess and honor this endeavor. As the assembly of gods and humans spreads its blessings, your name shall suddenly emerge, summoned forth. With respectful deference, I await your esteemed presence.\n\nI hold in deepest reverence so-and-so, a master whose learning flows from profound sources, whose Dao towers like a mountain peak. You grasp the subtlest mysteries of the profound and empty, embodying stillness and non-action. Your mind upholds the strictness of ritual purification, and your strength bolsters the gates of the teaching. From the first, I trusted in your conduct among men. In this age, who but you could lead?\n\nNow, for the sake of Lingji Palace, we propose a Universal Salvation Assembly, to be held on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, with a special ten-day observance. Three days of fasting will precede the nine-morning rites. Externally, the teachings will be expounded; internally, the *Scripture of Salvation* will be recited. I implore you to condescend to your exalted station and preside over the ritual proceedings. Should the souls of the departed find deliverance, this assembly will indeed be illuminated. Looking up, I rely on your wisdom; bowing low, I risk overstepping.\n\nI, dwelling in rustic obscurity, am but a latecomer—what do I know? Though the Dao may be beyond my hearing, the virtuous delight in doing good. Should you graciously descend from your carriage to take your seat, I shall sweep the mat to welcome you. A single boat can ferry one sixty *li*; I shall forever prepare incense for your long journey. Countless people turn to you in devotion—joining the multitude, I shall not be cast aside.\n\n---\n\nOn behalf of the villagers, I petition for the appointment of a lecturer to the capital:\n\nFor long have I admired your noble character, not merely for a day. Recently, in discussing the mysteries, I presumptuously knocked at the gate of your cinnabar chamber. You deigned to respond with humility, casting your gaze upon me. Since our parting, this sentiment has never waned.\n\nNow, for the construction of the ritual platform at Lingji Palace, I have conveyed this humble request, entreating you to condescend to travel here. When it comes to the literary style of canonical texts, you are the one the people have chosen. In this age of moral exemplars, who but you could lead? Should you apply the fasting rituals as your own practice, enabling our deities to merge with the likenesses of immortals, how profound would be the blessings bestowed!\n\nThe timber of the ridgepole and the pillars of the threshold are not your proper place. Like the vastness of rivers and seas, all streams—even the muddy and stagnant—find their way to you. Should you deign to descend to the altar, I shall hold the broom in readiness.\n\n---\n\nA petition for the appointment of Yue Shan as temple warden:\n\nI, who respond to circumstances to benefit beings, have yet to open the gate of skillful means. Pushing aside the grasses to seek the mysteries, I long to behold the depths of true emptiness. You have graciously taken notice of me, yet for long I have proffered my card in vain, blocked by the long barrier of the western gorge, gazing toward the northern mountains in yearning. Now, having received your command, how dare I not act as your humble disciple?\n\nThe divine and enlightened cannot be fathomed—this petty one shall do his best to respond. Were it not for the precepts of the Venerable Master Chonggui, how could Pang the Layman display his spiritual powers? The *Record of the Pavilion of Great Compassion* is now complete; I dare to reveal my Eastern Slope visage. The Dao sanctuary of Caoxi is no small matter—why not take up the Sixth Patriarch’s koan?\n\nWhy has the Venerable Master Chonglin come? The Old Man of the Stone Path will surely not cast me aside. Fearing that the golden root may be misaligned, I still seek the jade axe to refine it. Should you deign to take this as your topknot and robe, it would be like moving an old case to this neglected thatch. I offer but a cluster of gourds and a bolt of fine silk, a modest gift like the purple bamboo shoots of Huzhou.\n\nMay your Dharma eye open wide; my private sentiments need not be spoken.\n\n---\n\nA congratulatory address on the appointment of Lu Shan:\n\n...\n\nHumbly I recall how the Venerable Master of Guangshun once ascended the jade steps of the imperial court, and how the Xiantong Chan Monastery was graced with the honor of a golden edict and inscribed plaque. What has shone before must surely return in its beginning.\n\nWith reverence I consider the Venerable Master of White Deer: the world is drenched in his Dharma rain, the fragrance of compassion fills the rocky cliffs—truly a superior person, blessed with the marks of virtue and power. I look up in awe at the boundless imperial favor, and bow in respect at the proclamation of his appointment. Scaling the lofty peak, he climbs the clouded heavens of the ten thousand years; his voice resounds, \"Long live the Emperor!\" The great monastery adorns the blessed land of the Three Mountains. His renown weighs upon the Three Mountains, and with a shout he scatters the wild foxes beyond the fields. Joyfully encountering the pair of deer before the hall, the monastic groves stand in solemn order, and the neighboring villages gleam with splendor.\n\nI reflect that I, in my humble station, am without ability, though our bond has long been established. How dare I, with my insubstantial and empty words, venture to approach the wondrous workings of his spiritual powers? Though his name is inscribed upon the pagoda and his writings manifest in his deeds, yet in advancing step by step, his strength surpasses others. Since the Dharma’s cause is no mere accident, the Dao sanctuary will naturally flourish. I now offer my congratulations, never forsaking compassion. Having been graced by the honor of his elephant-borne visitation, I pray he may reveal the sacred auspice of the green waterfowl. For a thousand years, this temple must receive the Buddha’s confirmation. With a single wisp of heart’s incense, one ought to join palms in reverence.\n\nMy written words are few, but my devotion runs deep. I humbly present this verse:\n\nUpon the rain-drenched peak he sits,\nHis wondrous powers vast and deep.\nRejoicing in the weight of royal grace,\nHis name soars high o’er Ten-Thousand-Year Peak.\n\n*Postscript of Inquiry by Zhou Shenggong*\n\nThis Zhou Shenggong is the finest of our hometown—a true \"white eyebrow.\" The common saying goes, \"Scholars are often ill-fated,\" and indeed it rings true. His four-six parallel prose seeks some response, yet this is beyond even my three-fold experience; I can only reply with a few brief points.\n\nAll mountains, forests, rivers, valleys, and hills are called *shen*—spirits—yet the Three Offerings hold particular solemnity in the rites. When yin and yang, wind and rain, brightness and darkness lose their proper rhythm, the Six Excesses are already warned against in medical texts. Ashamed of my lack of the mountain spirit’s efficacy, I have instead invited the river demon’s mockery, left speechless and unable to defend myself. What transgression have I committed? One may discern the truth in the end, yet might not misfortune and fortune still confound?\n\nThe tortoise does not weary of me; I rely solely on the first divination’s omen. The horse cannot speak, yet I dare inscribe the words \"peace\" in seal script. The yellow bear appears in dreams—dreams born of thought. The red snake transforms into a shadow—yet even shadows may be doubted.\n\nThese are all the toils of spirit and thought, leading to calloused hands and feet. The illness, long afflicted by frost and dew, is a calamity without cause. The moon now lodges in *Dou* and *Niu*—whose fault is this? If Heaven wills it, what can be done about fate?\n\nAs the common saying goes, \"The Master does not speak of the uncanny.\" Yet I have humbly received the brush’s sharp reproach, and deeply shamed the wooden scholar’s lack of letters. Forty-nine years of delusion—only now do I glimpse Qu Boyu’s regret. Twelve thousand breaths of *qi*—yet never have I heard the name of Wang Shuhe.\n\nI would rise from nine deaths to a single life’s remnant, to master the teachings of *Yongming’s* seven charts and eight wrappings. Though a hundred medicines have been tried in hope of some chance success, if even one man remains unhealed, it is called your failure. Why must you overturn and declare, \"There is that which stands with Heaven and rains upon Earth\"? The people of Yue revere reproach; the people of Chu revere ghosts—can their customs not be changed? The *Wei* stomach’s obstruction, the *Qi* stomach’s blockage—what use are those physicians?\n\nHaving not repeated the same error, I may yet take one more journey. I regularly rub the jade sphere—who reads the *Heji Jue*? Moreover, the parallel prose of four-six rhythms is itself a masterpiece.\n\nHaving consulted the oracle again and again, I glimpse at last the true circumstances. There comes a time when no medicine is needed—yet how can brush and ink suffice to record it? Your prayers have been long and earnest; what more could you say? Since your kindness has pressed me so, I cannot refuse.\n\nThough the broken-arm prophecy proved true, it did no harm to the benevolence of Yang Shu. Though the lost-axle kin were unharmed, it did not diminish the renown of Lou Shide. Twice have I sent letters of mourning, each time shamed by your commands. Though a gentleman may grieve in adversity, must he assume the guise of a petty man?\n\nIf Heaven does not summon me back, what can Bo Liao do against fate? For great renown must endure the trials of the altar’s pit, and dark spirits often rise in the wake of lingering illness. What crime has the crane committed? When will the phoenix’s forging be complete? Even a lame tortoise may yet take one more journey; the bedridden rooster can still reconnect. Yet I fear the mockery of “washing feet and losing wealth,” and dread the reproach of “extending a hand only to cast the next stone.”\n\nSince you have spoken to me so earnestly, I recall your footsteps with joy. To repay enmity with virtue—even the old fist finds no surfeit. Strive in learning and conduct, and may you never forget your former steps. To share another’s sorrows and rejoice in their joys—even Confucius and Mencius found this hard to articulate. To drown where others drown, to hunger where others hunger—this was the vow of Yu and Ji.\n\nTo skillfully save all things is to waste nothing. To speak when one can speak is to never misspeak. To seek a six-foot vine, one must first cultivate three-year mugwort.\n\nMy reply, written in haste, still harbors the fear of a bladder’s rupture. I would rush out in bare feet to welcome you, yet wait for your carriage’s arrival. I raise my whip in gratitude—why hesitate to follow in your steps?\n\n**Marriage Proposal for the White-Water Bridge Alliance**\nI recall that our two families, having borne sons as clever as paired fish, now unite for a second generation. The oracle confirms the harmony of the mating phoenix. The Zhus and Chens share an old bond; the Zhengs and Weis renew a long affection. We pledge by the green mountains and swear by the white waters. The karmic cause is now fulfilled—how fortunate we are!\n\nMoreover, your granddaughter’s virtue follows the legacy of her forebears, delighting in the zither’s charm like Bian of old. My grandson, raised on poetry and books, has yet to wield his brush to compose. Though this is a matter of kinship, why should age be a barrier? She may serve as Huang’s matchmaker, and all will call her the true wife of Liang.\n\nSpeak of love only when the time is right, offering fern and artemisia in dutiful service. As rites value simplicity, I humbly prepare hazelnuts and chestnuts to announce the betrothal. My modest gifts are listed on the right—with respect, I present this proposal for your consideration. May your esteemed kindness deign to reflect upon it.\n\n**Raising the Ridgepole Address**\nAs the Three Mountains converge, all proclaim this blessed land of great peace. From a single vein of lineage, the Dao’s gate follows the hidden path. Now, entrusted with the duty of the ancestral hall, we complete the work of building a home. The oracle and tortoise shell align with the auspicious hexagram; the people’s fondness for magpies and crows manifests as omens upon the roof.\n\nWith reverence, I consider [Name], who carries on the family legacy, his name sung in praise. In his hand, the jade tablet emerges from the brush’s artistry; in his heart, he holds the framework’s grand design. From a single household’s affairs, we rejoice in the splendor of the twin-petal tower. Sheltered within a hundred *li*, we celebrate the glory of the flowery county.\n\nOne day’s renewal brings ten thousand years of magnificence. As a humble craftsman, I dare not claim great wisdom. Following the given path, I plan and construct—how could I presume to saw or hew at will? In the marketplace of gold, they vie to boast of Fan Li’s wealth. Before the hall of colorful robes, I wish to emulate Lao Lai’s play.\n\nLet me offer the sparrow’s modest congratulations for the new hall, and ascend the rainbow’s high ridgepole. As the poem says:\n*Like you, the timber is fit for ridgepole and beam—*\n*Yet it still requires skillful carving.*\n*A great mansion shelters ten thousand, vast in its refuge,*\n*And in the courtyard, we rejoice in the triple sophora’s shade.*\n\n**End of Xu Xian’s Literary Anthology, Scroll Thirteen**\n**Xu Xian’s Literary Anthology, Scroll Fourteen**\n\n**Lamp Couplets for the Ridgepole**\n\n**Ridgepole Couplets**\nFor this palace:\nMay the sagely lord’s myriad-year Dao forever bring peace to the Central Lands,\nMay the luminous spirits’ singular virtue bestow blessings upon the state and household.\n\nThe phoenix’s fortune stretches long, eternally inscribing ten thousand years of prosperity,\nThe turtle-mountain’s grandeur stands firm, safeguarding the four borders in everlasting peace.\n\nRenewing the old to restore the grand design,\nWhen adversity reaches its peak, fortune returns—kindred aspirations are fulfilled.\n\n**Hall of Fixed Light**\nThe Buddha’s

seas.\n\nOur dynasty unifies all from north to south, heaven vast and earth broad,\nThe world knows peace once more, customs refined and winds pure as in ancient times.\n\nA flourishing era of civil brilliance—this is the time of great peace,\nBountiful harvests of fine grain bring joy to the eastern farmers in this year of plenty.\n\n**Golden Palace’s Birthday Celebration**\nThe Golden Palace’s transformation body manifests eighty-two forms, all sharing the same name and title,\nA jade goblet offers longevity—sixteen thousand years become spring and autumn.\n\nPenglai is entirely home to immortals, their names inscribed on the cinnabar terrace,\nThe Southern Dipper’s Old Man Star appears, its light joining the Eastern Well.\n\n**Jade Palace’s Birthday Celebration**\nOn the great celebration of the seventh month’s Zhongyuan,\nFive winds and ten rains mark a time of peace, jade candles present auspicious signs.\n\nHeaven-born ministers yield to Lord Lai, granting him a day’s precedence,\nThunderous cheers echo Zhuangzi’s eight-thousand-autumn blessing.\n\nFive-colored auspicious clouds appear in splendid omens,\nTriple harvests bring joy in celebrating great peace.\n\nThe Jade Palace’s clouds part, heaven lies close at hand,\nThe Silver River’s waters bathe the moon in clear radiance.\n\nHeaven’s seal is written in cinnabar phoenix script,\nEarth’s grandeur rises in the towering turtle-mountain.\n\n**Hall of Harmonious Kinship**\nBaskets and stands preserve the Zhou rites,\nRobes and caps restore the Han’s majestic bearing.\n\nLofty integrity and perfect

down through generations,\nA single arrow strengthens the resolve of sons.\n\n**Celebrating the Lantern Festival Couplets**\nHeaven unfolds the phoenix calendar—may the nation and altars endure for ten thousand years,\nEarth embraces the turtle-mountain—lanterns and towers illuminate the fifteenth night.\n\nOn the Lantern Festival’s radiant evening, carriages and horses bring three thousand guests,\nThe turtle-mountain’s resplendent decorations crown the southeast’s foremost peak.\n\nTen thousand bushels of lotus lanterns—towers and the night moon’s shadows intertwine,\nThree coins for a peck of rice—village shrines and spring winds bring joy to the people.\n\nPenglai’s three isles, where immortals dwell—palaces here are noble,\nThe Eastern Wall’s two stars, repository of texts—the Milky Way’s literary splendor.\n\nThe ancestral temple’s solemn rites have been observed for four hundred years,\nThe first month’s harmony begins on the fifteenth night—the Lantern Festival’s feast and revelry.\n\nThe sun’s brilliance adorns banners with golden characters,\nClouds part at the heavenly gates, revealing the jade brush’s radiance.\n\nTemple sacrifices preserve ancient rites for a thousand years,\nProclamations of honor are inscribed in lavish gold script.\n\n**Lamp Couplets**\nThe Perfected Lord receives the register—may the emperor’s longevity match heaven and earth’s endurance,\nThe Heavenly Master’s Dao is revered—may the sun and moon shine brightly for a hundred generations.\n\nThe sagely lord ushers in great peace—may his life rival the Southern Mountains, his

radiance of new honors,\nBlue cloth forms the net of talismans—ancient prophecies and figures in lavish splendor.\n\n**Universal Salvation Ritual**\nMay the present emperor’s reign endure for ten thousand years, his power as stable as bedrock,\nMay the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expound the scriptures ten times, his light manifesting in precious pearls.\n\nMount Tai stands majestic, the four peaks’ revered site—fasting for a single day,\nThe Great Canopy stretches boundless above the three realms—universally delivering all beings.\n\nThe divine capital spans eighteen thousand miles, the four lands coming to pay homage,\nThe seventy-two bureaus of Mount Tai deliver all beings.\n\nA single yellow cloud congeals in the spirit’s abode,\nThree thousand measures of sweet dew universally open the gates of salvation.\n\nMay the sagely lord’s life equal heaven’s, the cosmos enduring for ten thousand generations,\nMay Laozi take the Dao as his foundation, the four directions’ sun and moon ever bright.\n\n**Couplets for the Lonely Spirits’ Lamps**\nThe Eastern Wondrous Severity Palace manifests transformations across the ten directions, light revealing auspicious signs,\nThe Western Na Kingdom’s Maitreya and Great Brahma vow to deliver all beings.\n\nPurified through fasting and bathing, serve the Supreme Emperor with an undivided heart,\nThe departed souls ascend directly to the Southern Palace, attaining the wondrous Dao.\n\nOn the Jade Capital Mountain, heaven lies but a foot and a half away, piercing straight through the Dark Capital,\nThe Ganges’ sands

revered site—ten thousand spirits come to pay homage.\n\nA single pearl the size of a millet grain—ten directions’ worlds together behold its light,\nSeveral cases of jade scriptures—hundreds of ancestors and ten thousand generations all receive deliverance.\n\nThe Eastern Florescence’s pure realm, the Western Na Kingdom—upholding precepts and practicing fasting,\nThe Southern Prosperity’s high office, the Northern Capital’s Cold Pool—saving the living and delivering the dead.\n\nA single libation of cool, sweet dew,\nNinefold mysteries ascend the Upper Clarity’s thoroughfare.\n\nEight colors and nine chapters reveal the wondrous Dao,\nHundreds of ancestors and ten thousand generations ascend the Vermilion Palace.\n\nThe three paths of suffering are liberated, transcending the three realms,\nEight-colored radiance illuminates the eight directions.\n\nHearing the scriptures and listening to the Dharma, together we arouse compassion,\nSharing food and clothing, all equally enjoy warmth and sustenance.\n\nThe Blood Bowl Assembly—Mulian repays his mother’s kindness, his filial piety reaching through heaven and earth, his divine powers unmatched;\nEarth Treasury presides as Teaching Master, his Dharma pervading the worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, the Three Thousands.\n\n*Xu Xian’s Literary Gems, Scroll Fourteen concludes*",

In the second year of Kaiyun of the Jin (945 CE), the Min king Wang’s internal strife erupted into war. I then led cavalry commanders Zha, Bian, and ten thousand riders to defect to Jianzhou. The following year, I seized Fuzhou, took the western path through the Xi gorge, scaled the Deer Ridge, and advanced from Nantai County to capture Zhang and Quan. A villager surnamed Hu knelt before my horse and said: \"Just now, routed soldiers wrought havoc, becoming the people’s unforeseen enemy. Today, we behold the royal army once more. If Your Lordship pities their innocence and revives them with a breath, sparing them from calamity, no virtue could be greater.\"\n\nThe troops halted and formed ranks.

      "translated_text": "In the spring of the eighth year of Taiping Xingguo in the Song Dynasty (the year *guiwei*), no rain fell, and seeds remained unplanted in the earth, causing the stewards deep concern. In the second month, on the auspicious day *wuz*i, divination was performed before me. Before the old auspicious shrine lay a deep pool, its circumference spanning four or five *zhang*, its depths unfathomable. Suddenly, clouds and *qi* surged upward, lingering without dispersal the entire day. At dawn the following day, fierce winds, thunder, lightning, and hail arrived in unison, and the people rejoiced greatly.\n\nThree days later, at first light, Zai Shengming came to the shrine to seek an answer. He beheld the shrine swept away, reduced to a ruin by floodwaters. Filled with astonishment and doubt, he prepared incense and submerged it in the pool, offering prayers. Suddenly, a wooden incense burner emerged from the water’s center, its ash unsullied by moisture—sure proof of a divine presence. In an instant, twin dragons coiled in the distance, bearing the shrine westward upon their wings, until they reached the islet where the mountains barred the stream’s flow. This islet was formerly called Incense Burner Peak. Crows and magpies took flight, calling as if to welcome something. Paper money marked the boundary, and a rare fragrance suffused the air. By night, the auspicious glow of heavenly lamps appeared; by day, the sound of metal and stone resounded. The villagers marveled and, seizing the opportunity, built a temple upon the site. Later, the temple produced the auspicious sign of *lingzhi*, and so it was named the Ancestral Temple of Zhi Islet.\n\nIn the first month of the first year of Yongxi, on the day *dingmao*, the construction was completed and the matter reported. The benefactor was a man of Henan surnamed Fang, named Jue, who oversaw the work.",

      "translated_text": "In the second year of Qiandao, *bingxu* (1166), Fang Jue’s grandsons—Xun, Gan, and Zhong—presented the matter to Prefect Feng Li of the prefecture, who inscribed the plaque with the four characters *Hujing Ganying* (\"Protecting the Realm, Responding to Devotion\"). In the third year of Xining, *gengxu* (1070), Zhang Guan of Hejian, Chen Pengchu of Yingchuan, Lin Huaixian of Jinan, and Huang Ban of Jiangxia reported the affair to Cheng Shimeng, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, who memorialized the throne. At the time, the Wang clan of Banshan held power in the court, and the people were burdened by the *Green Sprouts* corvée, so the matter was not addressed.\n\nIn the eighth year, *yimao* (1075), when Liu Yi, a native of the prefecture, governed Guizhou, Jiaozhi raiders invaded the border and seized Qin and Lian prefectures. Liu Shu, then serving alongside Zhou Ruli in the autumn bureau, prayed to me, and I manifested the numinous power of Mount Gong. The raiders indeed retreated. Liu Shu then submitted a full report. During the Yanshao era, my hidden merits became most conspicuous: the victory of Han Zhongwu at Dayi Garrison and the achievements of Monk Yuan of Wu’an. Xue Bi, the Pacification Commissioner of the circuit, memorialized the throne during the Duanping era.\n\nIn the first year of Duanping, *jiawu* (1234), Zhou Shuo, Supervisor of the Left Treasury, and Zhou Sui, Prefect of Chaozhou, detailed the matter and submitted it to the chief minister Li Zongmian. In the third year, *bingshen* (1236), in the tenth month, He Cong, the military commissioner of the circuit, was appointed Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, and the imperial decree was finally obtained. In the second year of Jiaxi, *wuxu* (1238), the edict was issued, bestowing the title *Lingji* (\"Numinous Aid\") and adding honorifics. The gods rejoiced, the people celebrated, and their virtue was thus made manifest.\n\nSince the dynasty began selecting officials through the examination system, I have been enrolled in the register of successful candidates. Those from my hometown who passed the examinations soared like meteors, surpassing all other counties south of the river. Thereafter, the literary flourishing grew ever greater: those listed on the *Huangjia* (imperial examination roster) were numerous, as were those selected in the highest ranks of the Southern Palace. Their reputations resounded, their ranks were lofty—some held office in the autumn court, some oversaw the imperial treasury, some governed flowery domains, some instructed the floating lords. Even those with minor ranks could be counted by the cartload or measured by the bushel.\n\nLater, Fang Ce of the Henan Fang clan, styled Zhu, and Wang Jie, styled Lang, each passed the imperial examinations through their literary talents. Both had divined their success through dreams at my shrine and received their reward. Such is the breadth of my merit among the people—far beyond the hearsay of idle gossip, achieved not in a single morning or evening.\n\nSince the temple’s founding in the Kaiyun era of the Later Jin, counting the *jiazi* cycles, over two thousand four hundred years have passed. Initially dismantled to become a village altar, its foundation lay by the banks of Qingbu Stream. It was later relocated to the east of the lane, where the present Lingji Palace now stands. The entire household, encircled by devotion, received celestial favor and titles:\n\nI, *Zhizheng*, was canonized as *Jiutian Jinque Mingdao Dade Dashian Xianling Puji Zhenren* (\"Perceiver of Truth, Great Immortal of the Ninefold Golden Towers, Illuminating the Dao and Manifesting Virtue, Numinously Efficacious and Universally Beneficent Perfected One\"), and enfeoffed as Jiang Wang.\n\nZhong, *Zhie*, was canonized as *Jiutian Yuque Xuanhua Fujiao Shangxian Zhaoling Bojie Zhenren* (\"Perceiver of Righteousness, Supreme Immortal of the Ninefold Jade Towers, Propagating Transformation and Upholding the Teaching, Illustriously Numinous and Vastly Beneficent Perfected One\"), and enfeoffed as Rao Wang.\n\nOur father, named Wen, was enfeoffed as Qi Wang and canonized as *Zhongwu Zhenren* (\"Loyal and Martial Perfected One\").\n\nOur mother, née Tian, was canonized as *Renshou Xianfei* (\"Benevolent and Longevous Immortal Consort\").\n\nMy wife, née Tao, was enfeoffed as *Jingguo Furen* (\"Lady of Jing State\") and canonized as *Shunzhu Renhui Xianfei* (\"Compliant and Assisting, Benevolent and Kind Immortal Consort\").\n\nZhong’s wife, née Xu, was enfeoffed as *Weiguo Furen* (\"Lady of Wei State\") and canonized as *Shanzhu Ciyi Xianfei* (\"Kindly Assisting, Compassionate and Virtuous Immortal Consort\").\n\nOur five sons:\n- **Chawen Hui**, *Yong’an Marshal and Guardian*, canonized as *Yuanshuai*.\n- **Bian Hao**, *Wu’an Marshal and Guardian*, canonized as *Yuanshuai*.\n- **Wei Cen**, *Military Commissioner and Left Gate Marshal*.\n- **Zhao Zhong**, *Commander-in-Chief and Right Gate Marshal*.\n- **Diao Yanneng**, *Commander of the Vanguard and Marshal of the Army*.\n\nOur four elder brothers—*Zhigao*, *Zhixun*, *Zhijian*, and *Zhixun*—were all enfeoffed as kings and received sacrifices in the temples of Jinling. Their origins and generations are fully recorded in the *History of the Five Dynasties*. This temple is the progenitor of all such shrines. *Zu* (\"ancestor\") signifies a beginning—how could one forget the origin and obscure its source?\n\nThe founding and history of the Ancestral Temple have been recounted above. All things decay with time, and without repair, they decay further. Thus, we built halls of wood and chambers of stone, planning for a hundred thousand years. The merits were vast, the expenses great, and the names and contributions of the benefactors remain on record. This occurred in the year *dinghai* (1287), the twenty-fourth year of the Zhiyuan era, on the day *dingwei* of the eleventh month.\n\nTwelve years later, the grand gate was restored, and the plaque was inscribed with the name *Zhiyu Zumiao* (\"Ancestral Temple of Zhi Islet\"). As the old stele had eroded, I descended this stele and inscribed it at the request of the gentlemen of the Henan Fang clan—Zhuangyou, Fengwu, and Sixi.\n\n**Inscription:**\nThe waters flow—trace their source.\nThe leaves of trees—seek their root.\nWhen the source runs deep, the streams diverge.\nWhen the root stands firm, the leaves flourish.\nThis is the Ancestral Temple, revered shrine of this land.\nHere it has stood for a hundred thousand years.\nIts merit rivals the sun and moon, its virtue the heavens and earth.\nIts names and titles are preserved in history.\nOf old, its temple was called *Ming* (\"Illustrious\"), and the gods were divine.\nNow, its celestial rank is that of immortal and transcendent.\nIts blessings have been bestowed upon the people—\nHow shall we repay them? With offerings of orchids and ferns.\nIn the year *dinghai*, the temple was renewed.\nTwelve years later, our gates were grandly restored.\nInscribed upon this stele, carved into stone,\nIts origins recounted, its sacrifices transmitted.\nLike the sacred peaks, its fame resounds thrice.\nFor ten thousand myriad years, we pray for the sagely lord.\n\n**Record of Lingji Palace**\nMy surname is Xu, descended from the Ying clan. The physician Boyi of the Xia dynasty was enfeoffed in Xu, in the land of Xiapei Tong County. The state flourished through the Xia, Yin, and Zhou dynasties, each era marked by great merit. King Yan of Xu governed with such renown for benevolence and righteousness that he received the auspicious omen of a crimson bow and vermilion arrows. When King Mu of Zhou heard of this, he attacked Xu. Unwilling to let his people suffer, King Yan retreated to the foot of Wuyuan Mountain in Pengcheng, naming the mountain after himself. There he dwelled. For over three thousand years, generations of descendants—eminent figures and towering scholars whose deeds are recorded in history—all trace their lineage to King Yan, my ancestor.",

During the chaos of the Five Dynasties, heroes and warlords arose in swarms, carving up the land and plundering one another. By the Son of Heaven’s decree, I was left to guard Jinling. Overseeing more than twenty prefectures south of the Yangtze, I eased taxes and relaxed levies, ensuring the army was well-provisioned. The tribes of the forests and caves adhered to the laws, holding fast to their oaths even unto death. The elderly and children played and wandered, joining hands to sing in celebration. Above, none bore grievance; below, none harbored enmity. The people of the Jiangnan region owed their lives to me. My merit and virtue shone as brightly as the sun and moon—though ages may pass, they cannot be erased.\n\nIn the second year of the *Kaiyun* era of the Jin, the King of Min, surnamed Wang, lost his state and sought my aid. I led an army of ten thousand, advancing by both ship and foot. The prefectures of Min each surrendered their cities. The following year, I took Fuzhou and captured it. As the army reached the southern bank of the Xiajiang, we passed through Qingbu. The elders of the village came forth with jars of wine to welcome my troops, yet they lamented: \"Just now, several hundred routed soldiers hid atop Biefeng Peak. Arrogant and violent, they were on the verge of rebellion. Had your royal army not arrived today, they would have overthrown our neighbors—how many of us would have remained?\" I then turned my forces southward, scaling the peak, blunting their vanguard, breaking their strength, and annihilating their ringleaders. All their followers were captured. In the end, the rebels cast aside their armor and cheered in surrender, yielding without battle. The villagers bore no grudge; markets carried on as usual. Not a single trace of disturbance marred the fields or their harvests.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, to this day, the mountainside is called \"Battle Gate,\" marking the beginning of this event. When my army returned, the elders clung to me in admiration and reluctance, unwilling to let me depart. They cut thatch to build a hut north of Biefeng’s Dragon Gorge, where they painted my likeness and enshrined me in a temple. Morning incense and evening lamps were offered to pray for my longevity. My heart stirred with sorrow, and I swore to the people: \"Next year, I shall depart this world and dwell here, bound in friendship with you all.\" When the time came, I manifested in dreams to reveal my spirit. No year brought famine, no people suffered premature death or plague. Divinations for rain and harvests were answered as swiftly as echo follows sound. In life, I could not fully bless my people; in death, to be venerated in their land and sustained by their offerings—this is no deceit against them.\n\nAs years passed and months turned, the temple fell into disrepair, its roof leaking and walls battered by wind, leaving no shelter. Yet suddenly, a towering cloud of qi arose, and a divine dragon coiled in protection. The wooden censer remained unbroken, my likeness stood firm and unyielding—all who witnessed it marveled. A villager named Fang Jue first established a temple in the wilds of Chuanyan, honoring me with the title \"Guardian of the Realm, Moved by Devotion.\" This is the ancestral temple of Zhiyu.\n\nIn the early years of Xiangfu, customs shifted and the population flourished. The village elders consulted one another and unanimously agreed to rebuild the temple by the banks of Qingbu’s Yansi Stream. Once, the stream’s torrents surged violently, drowning fields and crops. With divine soldiers, I dredged its source and diverted its flow, ensuring it no longer harmed the people. Thus, the place is still called \"Altar of the Community,\" where traces of the past remain.\n\nAs mulberry fields turn to seas and things transform with time, there were always villagers who gladly offered their land.",

Not a single trace of disturbance marred the fields or their harvests.",

      "translated_text": "To the east of Dragon’s Head Peak, the land lay broad and level, its mountains and waters both exquisite. I divined an auspicious site and made my dwelling there. Magpies and crows lent their numinous presence; bees and serpents gathered in throngs. Paper money marked the sacred bounds, and wondrous fragrance assailed the senses. By night, heavenly lamps appeared as omens; by day, the sounds of metal and stone rang forth. The villagers, moved by these signs, built a temple there. They summoned carpenters, stonemasons, and laborers, who gathered with tools in hand beneath the shrine. They hewed planks, shaped deafening columns, and laid foundations; they fired tiles, molded bricks, and raised walls. In the ding-you year of the Zhenghe era, the work was completed with ease. My likeness was rendered with solemn majesty, its presence awe-inspiring. To this day, the elders still recall and recount these events.\n\nAs the temple was expanded and opened, its halls grew deep and vast—this was during the Longxing era. In the autumn of the gui-wei year, when the reign title was changed, the kitchens and storehouses were enlarged. By the spring of the bing-yin year of the second Kaixi reign, the main halls and courtyards were erected, their steps and ranks in perfect order. Lofty was its height, resplendent its newness. Its scale and design surpassed all former efforts. This was in the eighth year of the Xianchun era, the ren-shen year. Even now, the names of the benefactors inscribed upon the beams have not faded. I reflect upon the ancients, and their hearts truly align with mine. Thus, I dare not rest idle in my abode, for I must safeguard their descendants and the common folk—such is my bounden duty, and therein lies its merit.\n\nAs for the temples and images in the west, south, and north, all trace their origins to this place. Though they were later divided and dispersed, the passage of time has been long. If one were to question the white-haired elders, they would attest to how deeply my numinous virtue has taken root in the people.\n\nDuring the calamity of the Jingkang era’s yang-nine misfortune, I protected the realm with divine soldiers, manifesting the spirit of the mountains and grasses, displaying the fluttering banners and swaying standards. The treacherous rebels were executed, and the Central Plains restored to peace. My deeds were reported to the imperial court.

      "translated_text": "During the Jiaxi era, the local prefect of Chaozhou, Zhou Sui, along with village elders Zhang Shaobai and others, submitted a petition to the court. A rescript in gold ink bestowed praise, conferring the honorific title *Lingji* upon me, and the temple’s sacrificial register was splendidly renewed, its rites further augmented. Both gods and men rejoiced—how grand and glorious!\n\nYet of late, times have changed and affairs diverged; the swans of the central marsh have but newly alighted. As for the temple’s upkeep, who has leisure for such matters? The roof’s crown is askew, the foundation’s sandals unaligned—who will set them right? The walls crumble in shadow, the murals dim and obscure—who will restore them? If I do not exalt my illustrious deeds, widely manifesting them to the four quarters and proclaiming them to all of you, it would be remiss indeed. Should even a single meal be neglected, how could this remain a place of reverence and divine tranquility?\n\nThe villagers each consulted me on their affairs, seeking my brush to validate their fortunes. I revealed to them the oracle, saying: *The sixty-four slips correspond to the sixty-four hexagrams of the* Yijing. *Nothing in heaven or earth lies beyond the* Yijing. *As a book of divination, it determines fortune and misfortune—thus it decides all.* Having shown them the slips’ use, how could I dare take up my brush to compose a text, entrusting and charging you all? Let this be my proclamation: from this day forward, each of you must attend to your duties, setting the mean within your hearts. Plan and labor to establish your merits, that the ruined may be revived, the old made new.\n\nI dare not claim sole credit for this glory; in initiating such affairs, the people’s livelihoods must be ordered. May they prosper in longevity and wealth, flourish and thrive—my blessings upon them are not slight. On an auspicious day in the eighth month, the autumn of the gengxu year, the work was completed, and I was asked to inscribe this record.\n\nMy royal grandfather ruled Wu and was enfeoffed as Prince of Qi, posthumously honored as *Zhongwu*. He had four elder brothers: the eldest, named Zhigao, inherited his father’s title and was later re-enfeoffed in Tang. The next, Zhixun, Zhijian, and Zhixun, all held power in Wu, were enfeoffed as princes, and each received temple sacrifices in Jinling. I am Zhizheng, enfeoffed as Prince of Jiang. My second brother, Zhikua, was enfeoffed as Prince of Rao. These events are recorded in history, and my hidden merits are detailed in the *Book of [Missing Character]*, under the *Bureau of Sacrifices*. I have partaken of this land’s offerings for over four hundred years, and shall continue for a thousand thousand more—beyond reckoning.\n\nIn this sagely dynasty’s era of unity, all within the realm offer allegiance. Heaven and earth, ghosts and spirits, all partake of its virtue. Humbly awaiting the imperial grace, I look up to the throne’s decree. May this honor and favor meet expectations, and may the people never forget. Thrice I cry: *Long live the emperor! Long live the emperor! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years!*\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*Gentle and yielding, the Prince of Yan,*\n*His filial descendants are blessed.*\n*Unfailing in virtue,*\n*He dwells in this land.*\n*By winding Biefeng, east of Dragon’s Head,*\n*The Lingji title bestowed—his merit to the people.*\n*The new temple stands resplendent,*\n*Its renown mighty and bright.*\n*Shoulder to shoulder, the people gather,*\n*Coming to offer and partake.*\n*You, the people, do not doubt—*\n*Abundant blessings descend.*\n*I pledge this ode,*\n*Carved in stone, unyielding.*\n\n**On the Stele’s Reverse:**\nSome say stele inscriptions must have a reverse side, while records need not. I know not what defines a *record* or a *stele*. Those called *records* without a reverse—such as the *Record of Music*, *Record of Learning*, *Records of History*, *Mourning Records*, *Biographies*—are not steles. Once engraved on stone, it is called a *stele*. Steles employ *ci* and *ming*, both mournful texts, while records do not. Long ago, Liu Zongyuan composed a stone inscription for his father, yet still inscribed the names of his disciples and followers on the reverse. The reverse of a *biao* began with Liu; the reverse of a *record* began with Xu, Prince of Jiang—who would dare question it?\n\n**Stele’s Reverse:**\nHeaven has not yet forsaken this culture, thus it lends me its hand to glorify virtue and illuminate goodness. It is your duty to assist me in this endeavor.\n\nRecently, Lin Dongcun’s public assembly presented the words of Zhou Junxi: *\"Shall we give birth to a Shen, or to a Yin?\"* How profound! These words speak for me. Let them be carved at your side. When scholars ascend this hall and read this record, may they know what to strive for, and never bring shame upon the gods.\n\n**Further:**\nIn life, one is a man; in death, a spirit. Those who serve the state and benefit the people deserve temple sacrifices. Temples with imperial decrees must have steles to record their deeds. Long ago, Liu Hou was demoted to the god of Luo Pool, and Han Wengong composed a record for him. Though I have emulated but a fraction of Liu Hou’s deeds, I lack his talent and cannot secure a Han Wengong to inscribe my story. How then shall I instruct posterity? I dare recount my own history; let those who come after Han Wengong record it.\n\n**Record of Upholding Sincerity:**\nThe hall of Lingji bears the inscription *Cuncheng* (\"Upholding Sincerity\")—this is the god’s own brush. One day, a guest from afar arrived, seeking to borrow my numen. Clad in ceremonial robes, he entered the hall and found the god’s compositions—steles, inscriptions, records, and eulogies. Reading them carefully, he pondered deeply before withdrawing and asking: *\"Why are only the two characters* Cuncheng *left uninscribed? Is it that they exist but remain uncarved?\"* He sought my answer.\n\nI, a spirit, cannot speak with my mouth, so I borrow brush and tongue to reply: *Sincerity is truth without falsehood. Human nature is inherently sincere; without sincerity, one cannot establish oneself. Between ruler and minister—this is sincerity. Between father and son—this is sincerity. Among brothers, husband and wife, friends—this is sincerity. Sincerity is one and the same; seek it within yourself, and it will endure. This is not the so-called* Way of Sincerity. *If one strives in this, though thunder roars above, one will not fear; though abysses yawn below, one will not tremble. There is no other reason—sincerity abides.*",

      "translated_text": "If but a single word is untrue, a single phrase insincere, it is called delusion—it is not sincerity. How grave it is! In the darkest chamber, though one sees no one, every gesture, every glance, lays bare the heart’s depths. Those in whom sincerity abides are few indeed; those who speak falsely flow like a torrent. If a minister thus serves his lord, the lord will doubt. If a son thus speaks to his father, the father will doubt. When brothers, friends, husband and wife interact in such a manner, there is nowhere doubt does not arise. Once the mind of calculation sprouts, even gulls and crows will not alight—how much less men, how much less spirits and gods?\n\nYou, who do not deceive yourself, are true and without falsehood. Though you do not speak of sincerity, sincerity abides of itself. What need is there for ornamentation? The *Book of Changes* says: *\"Guard against deceit to preserve sincerity.\"* The meaning of these two characters begins here. Do you understand? Remember this well.\n\n**Record of the Hall of Familial Harmony**\nThe *Record of the Hall of Familial Harmony* serves to clarify human relationships. Among the great bonds of humanity, none is greater than loving one’s kin. To love one’s kin is for the father to be a father, the son to be a son, the elder brother to be an elder brother, the younger brother to be a younger brother, the husband to be a husband, the wife to be a wife. Thus, in the *Rites of Zhou*, the Grand Steward instructed the king to govern the myriad people through eight principles, the first of which was *\"cherish one’s kin.\"*\n\nTruly, for the father to be a father, the son a son, the elder brother an elder brother, the younger brother a younger brother, the husband a husband, the wife a wife—this is the foundation of human relationships. This is why the Grand Steward, in governing the myriad people, must first speak of cherishing one’s kin. Cherishing one’s kin is the root of teaching the people.\n\nIn the flourishing eras of the Three Dynasties, human relationships were clear among the high, and the common folk were harmonious below. Filial piety, kindness, fraternal love, and deference were practiced in harmony and humility. This was not a matter of cultivation or innate nature—it was the teaching of the sages, achieved without sternness.\n\nFrom the Qin and Han onward, governance relied entirely on expediency, heedless of propriety. The ancient sages’ teachings on fostering kinship among the people were entirely abandoned. Thus, the great principles of order were not established, rites and righteousness were not illuminated, and the world daily descended into deceitful conduct, its ills beyond remedy. Fathers and sons no longer dwelt together, brothers could not tolerate one another, moral instruction was severed, and the customs of the state were corrupted, until the world no longer knew the meaning of kinship.\n\nThus, the people of antiquity were pure; the people of today are cunning. The people of antiquity were sincere; the people of today are shallow. Is it that the people of today are inferior to those of old? Only if a sage like Yao or Shun, like Yu or Tang, like King Wen, King Wu, the Duke of Zhou, or Confucius were to arise, upholding and preserving their virtue, so that fathers and sons, brothers, husbands and wives might understand the meaning of their roles—only then might the customs of high antiquity be glimpsed again in our time.\n\nNow, under the unified sagely court, governance is guided by benevolence. The sagely words are proclaimed, with filial piety and obedience foremost among the virtues encouraged for the people. Villages and towns are permitted to recommend those who exemplify these virtues, that they may be known.",

      "translated_text": "The spirits rejoice, leaping and exclaiming in delight. Hearing of this from all directions, the people naturally transform themselves. Some are renowned for their chastity and fidelity, others for their virtuous widowhood. Gates of righteousness and arches of filial piety stand everywhere, each with its exemplars. Yet despite these offerings, the gods remain as if unhearing—knowing the customs remain corrupt, this brings shame upon the divine. The spirits cannot remain silent at such a time. They command the villagers to repair this hall. To the east of the main hall, a chamber is built to honor the kin of the gods, cherishing those they hold dear. Thus, it is named the Hall of Kinship and Harmony. When those who come to the temple ascend this hall, gaze upon these images, the heart of kinship and harmony may naturally arise within them.\n\nThe hall is completed, and this record is made to illuminate human relationships. From this day forward, let fathers be kind and instructive, let sons be filial and admonishing; let elder brothers be friendly and respectful, let younger brothers be reverent and obedient; let husbands be harmonious and righteous, let wives be gentle and upright. Strive on, strive on—may you not be unworthy of this hall’s name.\n\nIn the third month, the first day of the gui-chou, the jia-wu year of the Zhiyuan era.\n\n*Record of the Divine and Efficacious Perfected Lord Jingxian of Biefeng.*\n\n---\n\nMoreover, to the east of the main hall of the Divine Efficacy Palace stands a hall, its plaque inscribed with the words *Kinship and Harmony*. A scholar, gathering his robes and ascending the hall, inquired: \"Does *kinship and harmony* not refer to what the stele inscription calls ‘harmony with the kin of father and mother’—that is, one’s relatives?\"\n\nI replied: \"Indeed.\"\n\nHe continued: \"From great-grandfather down to great-grandson—are these not the kin of the father?\"\n\nI again replied: \"Indeed.\"\n\nHe further asked: \"The mother’s brothers are called uncles, and the mother’s cousins are called maternal cousins—are these not the kin of the mother?\"\n\nI again replied: \"Indeed.\"\n\nThe scholar then sighed and said: \"Man, born between heaven and earth, is the most spiritually endowed of creatures. What distinguishes him from birds and beasts is his knowledge of the kinship of his father’s and mother’s kin. If one knows the kinship of one’s father’s and mother’s kin, then harmony follows. Yet if one must rely on these two words—*kinship and harmony*—to be known among others, what is the true intent behind this?\"\n\nI said: \"Well said! Do you understand? In today’s world, customs are governed by cunning and deceit, neglecting proper order, abandoning ritual and righteousness, discarding integrity and shame. That people still know harmony with the kin of their father and mother—I cannot yet believe it. Since the decline of the southern and northern courts, the way of filial piety and brotherly love has been lost. The *Tangdi* ode is forgotten, and the bonds of brotherhood are severed. Who still chants the *Lisi* ode, praising the virtue of descendants? Who still sings the *Taoyao* poem, celebrating the bride who brings harmony to her household? When fat lambs are prepared to hasten the arrival of uncles, when plump bulls are offered to welcome maternal kin—who still recites the *Famu* ode? Mencius said: ‘One without a heart of deference and yielding is not human.’ Thus, my heart is restless with what I desire, for silence is not permissible. To the people of Qin, the plumpness or leanness of the people of Yue stirs no concern in their hearts. Therefore, today’s discourse must be inscribed in writing, proclaimed in speech, and grounded in antiquity to enlighten them. Perhaps then the heavenly principle in human hearts—though as tenuous as a thread—may yet be unbroken, continuous, and still possess a way to be preserved and restored. This is what the ancients called *transformation*.\n\nFor the present age, nothing surpasses verbal transmission; for future generations, nothing surpasses the written word. Yet if the ancients had lived in a time when their Way could be practiced, there would have been no need for writing or speech. Speech arises only from necessity.\"\n\nThe scholar said: \"Truly, it is so.\"",

      "translated_text": "Once, it bore the title \"Responsive to Devotion\"; now, it is called \"Numinous Aid\"—such is the origin of its name. Yet what I speak of is not some power to sway men with fortune or misfortune, nor can I escape the duty of giving voice to its story. Though its shrine’s construction may be grand, surpassing that of former times, it is still insufficient to stir the gaze of later generations. Thus, we undertook a thorough renovation: repainting in five colors, sculpting the divine images, adorning them with yellow curtains and vermilion tables, lending them a measure of solemn dignity. By reckoning the years, this was the fifth year of Xianchun, in the cyclical year *jisi* (1269).\n\nAlas! Man is the most spirited of all creatures, and who does not know the love of parents, cherishing them all their lives? Yet when it comes to ancestors, that love fades and is forgotten—how much more so for those of higher generations? Those who till the land, labor as artisans or merchants, or even aspire to be scholars, ought to trace the origins of their forebears, restoring their legacy rather than dismissing it as a relic of the past, fit only for idle chatter in some book-lined study. Though all who read and grasp the principles of virtue may be called scholars, I dare not compare ordinary men to the likes of Yi Yin, who rose from the fields of Shen, or Fu Yue, who was discovered while building walls—these were sages of their age. Even the emperors of the Han, who won the realm from horseback, welcomed the counsel of peddlers and butchers, inscribing their merits on bronze tripods and recording their names in history. How could such achievements be the sole province of those who read and understand the Dao?\n\nIn my humble view, when the Qin dynasty brought ruin, men took refuge in obscurity to preserve their lives. But today, the state nurtures scholars through education, summons the worthy by edict, and sets forth clear paths for advancement. Whether one is a farmer, artisan, or merchant, all may be drawn upward to become scholars. Thus, I dare to set down this account, to encourage those who would follow that path. Some may call this hall a village study, a place for warming the *Li Ke* sacrifices—such talk is but the prattle of rustics from Qi’s eastern wilds; pay it no heed.\n\nIn the third year of the *Dade* reign (1299), on the auspicious day of the mid-autumn month, the *Shefeng* Mountain Recluse wrote this. *Composed on behalf of the Elder of Dong Village, the Record of the Numinous Aid Palace.*\n\nIn my youth, I was driven by a bold and restless spirit, chasing after fame and office. I shouldered my provisions and traveled thousands of miles, visiting every majestic and wondrous place under heaven, leaving no trace of the ancients unexamined. Just as I was lost in reflection, a letter arrived from my scholar-friend Zhang Guilong, presenting me with *The Collected Writings of Numinous Aid*. He wrote: \"In the indigo hills of Min, there stands an ancient temple called Numinous Aid. Its deities bear the surname Xu—one enfeoffed as the King of Jiang, the other as the King of Rao. Since the Kaiyun era of the Later Jin, over four hundred years have passed, and their merits in aiding the state and pacifying the people, in warding off disasters and repelling calamities, are too numerous to recount.

      "translated_text": "In the summer of the guisi year, Zhang Guilong, along with Shen Jianweng, Zhou Quan, Zhou Yong, Ming Linchun, Guo Yongweng, and Zheng Ruxian—seven men in all—jointly resolved to restore the temple and consulted the deities through divination. The gods manifested their presence, transforming brushstrokes into script, entrusting the task to them and renewing the edifice in radiant splendor. By the eighth month, the work was completed, and the deities again descended through the brush, recounting their deeds in sequence to compose this record. They revealed fortune and misfortune through hexagrams, exhorted loyalty, trust, ritual, and righteousness through prose and verse. Every word and phrase echoed the intent of Confucius and Mencius in their teachings for the ages. Such are the gods—wise, luminous, and upright—that even the brush of Ban Mengjian in the Western Capital, the *Three Capitals* of Zuo Taichong, the *Five Blessings* of Yang Ziyun, or the odes to sacred mushrooms and precious tripods, the hymns of yellow steeds and jade tablets, cannot compare. With gods so manifest, how could one dare to neglect them? The seven gentlemen, Zhang and his companions, reverently received the deities’ words and inscribed the record upon stone. The local scholar Lin Digong Yannian transcribed it, while I was entrusted with engraving the title in seal script.\n\nIn the twelfth month, the deities bestowed an ancient poem, saying: *\"The stele now stands—today’s affair is for you to record, for such is the will of the gods.\"* Before I could take up my brush, they granted another poem, this one spanning ancient and modern times, sixty-five stanzas in all. Among them were the lines: *\"Where the record endures, so too does the name; you may forget, but the gods do not.\"* I dared not refuse and thus composed this account of their words:\n\n*Of old, there were sacrifices—now, there is transmission.*\n*Of old, there were decrees—now, there is proclamation.*\n*Ancient writings exhort to virtue.*\n*The temple stands renewed, its affairs complete.*\n*Rain and shine respond to the dual heavens.*\n*The people pray with ever-deepening reverence.*\n*This inscription I carve to endure ten thousand years.*\n*May the world never forget, for virtue knows no change.*\n\n**Record of the Yüqìng Hall Daoist Sanctuary**\n\nThus have I heard. The Buddha has a gatha:\n*\"All things arise from the mind—where in the mind are they sought?\"*\nAnd why? Because *\"the mind itself is Buddha.\"*\nWhat is Buddha? The *Shi* explains: *Fu* means \"person.\"\nIf not for the person, there would be no embodied form.\nEternally real, without truth, without form,\nWithout patience, without hindrance, without substance,\nWithout coming or going, without entanglement—\nThus, thus, there is nothing to be settled.\nWhere is the person who does not understand?\nOne who exhaustively investigates the mind will find\nThe Buddha present at all times.\nIf the mind is otherwise, mere recitation of prajñā,\nEmpty talk, false guidance, greed for gain, and deceitful merit—\nThese are far inferior.\nEven when the great chiliocosm crumbles,\nHow much less can the Buddha’s single sanctuary endure?\n\nSince the Jingde and Xiangfu eras, the Buddha’s meritorious deeds have been renowned throughout the world. In every place, Daoist sanctuaries were established, each adorned with painted and sculpted Buddha images, revered with incense and offerings. Our village’s Yüqìng Hall is one such sanctuary. From the Kaixi bingyin year to the Yuanzhen bingshen year, reckoned by the Xia calendar, ninety-odd years have passed. Though not so distant in time, why has the sanctuary fallen into such disrepair, far inferior to its former state? Its roof leaks, its walls are breached, and damp rot lingers unaddressed.",

      "translated_text": "Those who pass by—though they have eyes, none turn to look; though they have hands, none point in recognition. Truly, it is like the people of Yue gazing upon the sacrifices of distant tribes, unmoved by whether they are fat or lean.\n\nYet do they not reflect that the labors of the ancients—hauling water, carrying firewood—were not accomplished in a single morning or evening? Thus did the Buddha’s vow declare: \"All buddhas arise in the world from mountain huts, unbothered by the nests of magpies upon their necks.\" With this illusory, fleeting body, I cannot idly occupy the land of kings or covet fine terrain. So I came to dwell in a stone chamber among the cliffs of Nan’an. The rise of Yüqìng Hall adds nothing to the Buddha’s realm, nor does its ruin take anything away. Yet by the Buddha’s wisdom, all are as these people. If such is the case, then their hearts are but yakṣas and rākṣasas—how can they be spoken to of the Buddha?\n\nMaster Zhigong of the Tang once met the Venerable Bodhisattva in the Yellow Cloud Mountains to expound the Dharma. A mendicant from Mount Song rose from his seat, bowed, and knelt to ask: \"In the degenerate age, by what karma do sentient beings fall into *sahā*, suffering for kalpas on end? What expedient means can save them?\" Zhigong replied: \"In the latter days, those who do evil are many, while those who form karmic bonds are few.\" The Venerable Bodhisattva said: \"These sentient beings bring it upon themselves.\" Truly, these words are true.\n\nNow I broadly expound the Dharma for all beings, universally guiding them to awakening. If there are good men and good women who can arouse the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, and with the seven treasures filling worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges offer them in generosity—without deluded thoughts, without attachment, without retreat—then by this cause and condition, the adornment of the Buddha-land’s merit and virtue: can it be measured? I do not speak falsely. These are true words, real words. Listen carefully now, and take the Buddha as your heart.\n\nThen he raised the Buddha’s verse again:\n*\"I have a single root of goodness,*\n*All born within the heart.\"*\nDo you understand? Thus it is said: *\"The mind itself is the Buddha.\"*\n\nIn the third year of the Qiandao era, the Buddha bestowed upon Dingguang the title *Yuanying Putong Ciji Dashi Bodhisattva*, commonly called the White-Robed Sage Duke, or the Pan’gu Dingguang Buddha. I dare to compose this record of Yüqìng Hall for the Buddha, to be inscribed before the hall and exhort the world.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Laibin Pavilion**\n\nWhen the request was made for Han Wengong to compose an inscription, many lamented not seeing his true portrait. I alone rejoiced. Little did they know that Wengong’s words so vividly captured the spirit and form of his subjects that, by grasping his intent, the true likeness becomes clear before one’s eyes. This is why I rejoice—understanding Wengong’s purpose in establishing the pavilion.\n\nMoreover, all things decay, yet literature alone endures. How true this is!\n\nThe lyrics of the Perfected One of Lingji were already exquisite in their beauty and perfection. Yet there remained a gap in the wall to be mended. Measuring it with a handboard, I found it to span over seventy tablets. Several gentlemen exhausted their efforts to complete it, then asked me to provide the painting. I considered it from afar and said: \"A wall standing alone in the open sky is vulnerable to the ravages of wind and rain. In time, it will surely crumble. If you wish to preserve Wengong’s record, that would suffice. Should the painting perish, at least my record may endure. For later generations who seek to recount this, let it be said: it is the record that matters, not merely the record.\"\n\nNow, in this era of sagely unity, the radiance of imperial might shines forth. The southern seas and all their realms present tribute. Gods and men rejoice, and the world once more knows peace. I dare to offer this painting as celebration for our time.\n\nAt its center stands a pavilion, its plaque reading *Laibin* (\"Receiving Guests\"). Before and behind it, scholar trees are planted, forming a \"Scholar Tree Market.\" To its east and west stand two arches, one named *Yuejin* (\"Delighting in the Near\"), the other *Huaiyuan* (\"Cherishing the Distant\")—such are the names given to them. The peaks rise steeply, the crags loom dark and wild. The post road stretches far, and travelers tread its path without cease, one following another.",

Our village’s Yüqìng Hall is one such sanctuary. From the Kaixi bingyin year to the Yuanzhen bingshen year, reckoned by the Xia calendar, ninety-odd years have passed. Though not so distant in time, why has the sanctuary fallen into such disrepair, far inferior to its former state? Its roof leaks, its walls are breached, and damp rot lingers unaddressed.",

      "translated_text": "Thus did the village elders and longtime residents speak among themselves: \"To the east of the lane stands a temple, home to the deity known as the *Guardian of the Realm, Responsive and Efficacious King*—a spirit who wards off calamity and repels misfortune, whose blessings upon the people are vast, and whose divine aid has never been wanting. Now that the drought has grown dire, how can we delay the rites of sacrificial beasts and jade offerings?\" On the *renshen* day of the seventh month, at the first light of dawn, they purified themselves and hastened in earnest to the temple courtyard to perform the sacrifices. The deity, moved by the people’s innocence, responded as swiftly as an echo or a shadow. In an instant, clouds and mist rolled in from all directions, thunder and lightning arrived, and a torrential downpour descended. Gazing toward the southern slopes of the mountain, they suddenly beheld a shimmering divine dragon, above which a yellow banner fluttered, emblazoned with the five characters: *Guardian of the Realm, Responsive and Efficacious King*. This title was none other than the former honorific of the present *Spirit of Lingji*.\n\nThree days later, on *jiayin*, the skies cleared. That autumn, the harvest was abundant, the rice yield doubled, and the once-parched fields teemed with life, their granaries overflowing. The farmers and elders, facing north, leapt and danced in reverence, bowing and prostrating themselves, their joy unbounded, their hearts brimming with gratitude.\n\nIn the eleventh month, on the winter solstice, the sovereign personally established an altar upon the bend of Qilong Mountain, where monthly sacrifices were offered in repayment of the deity’s virtue. After a full cycle of sixty years, a temple was erected—its halls grand and spacious, a perpetual abode for the spirit, enduring through the ages. Qilong, a mountain of renown, was thus revealed as the site where the gods first manifested beneath its banner. When the people prayed for rain, rain came; the deity never failed in wisdom or response. The community petitioned the authorities, and so the temple was named the *Hall of Rain-Praying Kings*, also called the *Dragon Gate Society*. This is the very aspiration of the village’s finest and most loyal, those who cherish merit and renown.\n\nFor mountains, forests, valleys, and hills that bring forth clouds and wind or reveal strange phenomena are all called *shen*—spirits. According to the rites of sacrifice, they are duly recorded in the canon of worship. Now that this deity has manifested through Qilong’s timely rains, transforming barrenness into sweetness and turning pestilence into harmony, the people have been revived, their lives restored. For four hundred years, the temple has received offerings, and who among the people would dare forget or grow negligent in their devotion?\n\nYet time passes swiftly; the shrine has fallen into disrepair, its images faded, no longer befitting the radiance of the divine. The temple keepers, Lin Chun and others, having received abundant blessings from the spirit, reflected upon the past with a sense of unfulfilled duty. They consulted the villagers and resolved to restore it. When they prayed to the deity, the spirit accepted their sincerity. A divine bird descended to inscribe characters—seal script and clerical forms, strange and wondrous—at first indecipherable. They then requested a transcription in common script. The prose, composed in parallel couplets, could now be heard and understood, as if someone had been present all along, though none had noticed.\n\nIn the first month of the new *Yuanzhen* era, on an auspicious day, the people of neighboring hamlets east and west joined forces, pooling their resources in harmony. They commissioned artisans to complete the work, renewing the old with the new. On the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month, *guihai*—the day before the beginning of spring in the following year—on the morrow of *jiazi*, the project was finished. They entreated me to compose this record.\n\nAs for me, how could I dare to boast or flatter, seeking favor with others? Humbly, I have set down these words, that the deity may forever be venerated in this land and eternally receive its due offerings.",

      "translated_text": "Long life, wealth, peace, and ease—these are the wishes of all people, and I shall surely grant them.\n\nAs for the noble lineage, titles, and origins of this deity, they are fully recorded on the stele of Lingji Palace to the east of the lane; even a hundred generations hence, they may be known. My name is carved in stone—what more need I say? I merely set this down to record the Lingji Traveling Shrine on Qilong Mountain, known as the Rain-Praying King’s Palace.\n\n*Self-preface by Lingji Perfected Immortal of Biefeng.*\n\n**Record of the Temple of Lingji Worthy and Sage King**\n\nThe stele of the Temple of Lingji Worthy and Sage King—this stele stands to ensure that his merit and virtue are never forgotten.\n\nSince the *Xiangfu* era, the deity’s responses to prayers and exorcisms, along with his supplications at the eastern shrine of Longshou Temple, have led to his imperial enfeoffment as the Worthy and Sage of the Three Celestial Jade Towers. The Perfected Immortal of High Inspection, Gaoxian Weiling Guangji—later incarnation of Lingji—though venerated in the sacrificial canon, had no formal liturgical composition.\n\nDuring the *Shaoxing* reign, the realm was divided into western, southern, and northern domains. In the sixth year, *jiachen*, the northern temple was grandly constructed, and the villagers, led by Lin □, recorded its history—ninety-eight years in all. Though the temple had nearly fallen into ruin, it was revived, and the names of its benefactors remain traceable. Counting the years, sixty-seven more have now passed.\n\nIn the third year of the *Dade* era, on the eighth day before the spring community sacrifice, Zeng Chen, Fu Long, and others, leading their fellow villagers, carried a single incense censer and hastened to perform rites in the eastern courtyard of the temple. They prayed to me, saying: \"This temple has long been abandoned. We wish to restore it but have not yet received an auspicious divination and dare not proceed.\" I admonished them, saying: \"It is auspicious.\" They then entreated me to compose an inscription for its stele, and I could not refuse.\n\nThe prayer reads:\n\nIn this era of imperial unity, the realm enjoys great peace. Daoist sanctuaries and Buddhist monasteries—all neglected things are now revived. The village establishes its altar, and the deity dwells in tranquility.\n\nIn the year of *Yuanxian*, the Dipper’s handle points to *yin*. The time for sacrifice arrives, and the rites are performed with utmost clarity. Yet the images are dim, their forms obscured. Tiles crumble, walls are defiled, and wind and rain batter them. Fearful and anxious, we seem to have failed in our duty. Thus, we consulted the people and divined by the gods. We cast yarrow and tortoiseshell, weighing the long and the short, the before and the after. Hesitant and uncertain, we placed our trust in me alone.\n\nIn obscurity, without sound or form, how dare I boast or deceive, misleading the ears of others? Yet I depend on this benevolent land—what more can I say?\n\nThe script turns from seal to clerical, from fish to bird. On the *yichou* day of the second month, an auspicious day and hour, earthworkers and carpenters set to their tasks. They trimmed flaws, filled cracks, restored the old, and enhanced the new. They adorned it with whitewash and painted it with cinnabar and azure. Assistants and attendants, above, correspond to the four stars. If the people act with virtue, they shall receive blessings and prosperity. The two steps bear the shields and plumes, guarding the village and its neighbors.\n\nThe six lords, adorned with pearls and jade, perform wondrous dances to the sound of reed pipes and songs. The *Yunmen* ninefold music resounds, and the *Fangzhang* eight delicacies are arrayed. A hundred entertainers, their forms lifelike and fierce, perform. Spectators fill the roads, their carriages lined side by side. Laughter and joy abound, their faces alight with happiness. The work is completed with ease, and I record it in writing.\n\nMy words are coarse and unrefined, like one clutching their chest in distress. Who am I? The Perfected Immortal Lingji. To the east of Longshou Temple, this record is inscribed on the stele.\n\nHeaven deems him worthy and sage; my later incarnation bears the surname Pan. His given name is known through his blessings. A direct descendant of the *Chengyu* lineage, he first entered Min. Clad in the robes of office, he was once recommended as a filial and incorrupt candidate. The imperial commissioner, Marquis Liu, honored him with silk and a rush-wheeled carriage. Though repeatedly summoned, he declined, holding wealth and rank as floating clouds. He chose to dwell on Biefeng, carving fields from the earth. Upright and pure, he felt no shame in partaking of simple fare.\n\nHis immortal bones were extraordinary; he studied under *Wochuan*. From Dragon Peak, he received a scroll, emerging from the blue and entering the mysterious. West of the Gorge River, where flying waters seethe, he walked upon the void without wetting or drowning. The world was astonished, the age amazed—his deeds touched the unseen.\n\nWeary of the clamor of the world, he made himself known through the Dao. \"To hear the Way in the morning is to die content\"—thus did he return to his true nature. One day, he transformed like a molting cicada. After the *Qiande* era, he appeared in dreams. Once his transgressions were purged, timely rains answered his prayers. The five grains flourished, bringing benefit to the people. The people, grateful and joyful, offered autumn sacrifices and winter provisions.\n\nBefore the temple’s establishment, sacrifices were held in the great courtyard. According to the old plaque, this began in the *Shaoxing* era. The temple was built with reverence, its reputation resplendent. In the first year of *Shaoding*, the hall was near collapse. Restoring its former grandeur required great effort. Only the worthy may approach sageliness, truly earning their illustrious title. The people exalt his virtue, and the authorities preserve it. If the divine is made manifest, listen with singular devotion.\n\nFrom this day forth, the sage may be venerated as Heaven. As for me, Lingji, my deeds have fulfilled the three thousand. Possessing all, I match the Three Spirits. On the *wu* day, most auspicious, the offerings are pure with pepper and fragrance. \"The people, too, are weary\"—this truly accords with my heart.\n\nInscribed in stone, this record shall endure for a thousand ages. I rely on the restoration of wonders, for without people, there is no cause. I humbly hope for imperial enfeoffment, that eight characters may shine with glory. With hands clasped in reverence, I bow my head—may the Son of Heaven live ten thousand years!\n\n**Record of the Temple of the Minister of Agriculture and the Community Corner Shrine**\n\nOnce, while attending the Heavenly Laba Festival, I lingered on my return. Suddenly, a guest appeared—girded with gold, robed in purple—standing beneath the hall. He cried out in a stern voice: \"Alive, one is a man; dead, one becomes a ghost. To be a gentleman’s ghost is to never dare bring misfortune upon others. To be a petty man’s ghost is to lack efficacy.\"\n\n\"The western temple has its record; the southern and northern have their steles. I shall soon rot away like grass and wood.\" Hearing his words, I ordered my attendants to bring him forward. He was an upright deity, the god of the Community Corner Shrine.\n\nI descended, took his hand, and led him up, saying: \"Had you not spoken, I would have nearly lost you. Wearing stitched robes and a ceremonial cap, one finds it hard to journey to Yue. In this age, only the wicked and the richly powerful may establish themselves. Only those who calculate to the finest detail may secure their livelihood. Your duty is to open the land for agriculture.\"",
      "overlap_context": ". They commissioned artisans to complete the work, renewing the old with the new. On the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month, *guihai*—the day before the beginning of spring in the following year—on the morrow of *jiazi*, the project was finished. They entreated me to compose this record.\n\nAs for me, how could I dare to boast or flatter, seeking favor with others? Humbly, I have set down these words, that the deity may forever be venerated in this land and eternally receive its due offerings.",

      "translated_text": "**Record of the Hall of United Spring**\n\nOn the evening of the great autumnal purification rite in the year of *Yuanxiu*, a villager named So-and-so came bearing incense and prayed to me, saying: \"For seventy or eighty years, my humble dwelling has been the dilapidated house of my ancestors. There was once a wooden plaque that read *Hall of Extended Blessings*, but it has long been buried in dust and neglect, its luster faded. I wished to renew it but could not. Now, admiring your resolve to honor such an ancestral intent and bring it to fruition, I have ordered my attendants to grind a thick ink of *Chuanmo* and fashion a brush from reeds. In one breath, I inscribed it—characters as large as a dou—reading *United Spring*.\n\nWhat is *United Spring*? It is the spring that pervades all things between heaven and earth. The sluggish stir, the submerged rise, the hooked sprout, the armored split—all swell and fill, all grow and mature. Who brings this to pass? Do you understand the meaning of spring?\"\n\nI replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nRetiring to reflect in private, I found no answer. Returning with my robe gathered, I said, \"Your servant is dull-witted. Pray, instruct me in these words.\"\n\n\"You ask what makes spring spring? There is heaven and earth. Man, born between them, is but one thing among many. If spring does not even know why it is spring, how can man comprehend it? Ah, how stubborn! Your words are confounding. Sit again, and I shall tell you.\n\nThe spring of heaven and earth *is* spring. The spring of man is this same spring. How could one seek spring outside of it? What is it, then? The spring of heaven and earth lies in its *qi*—warm and harmonious; in its nature—radiant and tender; in its *qi*—nurturing, sheltering, and protecting. This is why all things partake of spring. If the *qi* were scorching and harsh, that would be summer, not spring. If the nature were bleak and desolate, that would be autumn, not spring. If the intent were stern, urgent, and pressing, that would be winter, not spring. Without spring, what would become of things?\n\nMan is no different. You must understand this. Father as father, son as son, husband as husband, wife as wife, elder brother as elder brother, younger brother as younger brother—these are the great human relations. They must first take root in filial piety, kindness, fraternal love, harmony, and humility. Only when the root is firm and deep will the spring wind stir and move them: their branches will grow long, their leaves flourish, their blossoms bloom, and their fruits ripen. Otherwise, though spring rains water them day after day, it will be of no avail.\n\nThus, the root of man must be tended with care—planted with effort, entrusted to diligent nurturing—so that one may hope for growth, like the young shoots of a sapling. Extend this understanding to unite your household as one, and this will be a spring without spring, a spring in harmony with heaven and earth. How could it not swell and fill, grow and mature?\n\nHaving received these words, I was suddenly enlightened. Clutching the text, I returned home and hastily took up a brush to write it down. I instructed my family to prepare a feast—one dish, one cup—setting the table in the *Hall of United Spring*. Young and old gathered in order, toasting and urging one another, drinking and pausing. As I hovered between drunkenness and sobriety, I called for a servant to bring water for rinsing, then read the text aloud, making a humming sound for my family to hear. Clapping my hands, I declared, 'Though not yet drunk, I am fortunate that nothing troubles me. My heart truly knows the spring of this day! From today to tomorrow, and tomorrow to the next day—no day without spring. From this year to the next, and the next to a thousand, ten thousand years—what year will lack spring? I have found this spring, and you, too, have found it. May we never shame the name of this hall.'\n\nThe feast ended, and my family clapped their hands, rising with great laughter.\"\n\n*—Written by the Old Man of Biefeng.*\n\n---\n\n**Inscription for the Gate**\n\nWords must be loyal and sincere,\nDeeds must be earnest and respectful.\nRites must be solemn and reverent,\nDemeanor must be upright and proper.\nIn conduct toward oneself and others,\nOnly harmony and prudence suffice.\nEars, eyes, heart, and thoughts—\nI examine myself thrice daily.\nAdvancing knowledge and putting it into practice,\nOne may aspire to sagehood.\nIn affairs, emulate Yi and Zhou;\nIn virtue, follow Yan and Min.\nAccumulate goodness to transmit to your family,\nAnd blessings will surely overflow.\nInscribed upon this gate—\nLet your descendants heed these words.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Longevity and Heavenly Jade Cliff Daoist Sanctuary**\n\nThe Great Master of Universal Illumination of the Buddha’s Heart, Qingcong, styled *Stone Path*, was surnamed Bi by birth.

      "translated_text": "Initially, he received instruction under Master Heng Zhenwen of Dongshan and received the transmission from Master Guangzhi of Yuzhong. In character, the Master was inwardly luminous and outwardly harmonious, requiring no cultivation to refine himself. His mouth constantly recited Buddhist sutras, and as for Confucian texts, he never set them aside for a single day. Moreover, he was well-versed in the calligraphy of Zhong [You] and Wang [Xizhi], and at that time, his peers acclaimed him as the foremost among the Southern School’s White Eyebrows—who else but him?\n\nFrom Putian, the Master entered Fuzhou and first took residence at Yingtian Temple in Min, where he spent sixteen years. He often told others, “Among the eighty-four thousand dharma gates, one must first practice expedient means oneself.” He wished to establish another sanctuary but could not find a suitable place. Not far from Yingtian Temple, in the land known as *Niumingdi*, stood the former residence of Councilor Tang, which had been reduced to rubble after the ravages of war. In the *renchen* year of the Zhiyuan era (1292), the heirs of that estate offered the land for sale to the Master. Privately rejoicing, he said, “My karmic affinity with the Dao is no mere coincidence.” Thereupon, he donated his remaining robes and savings to purchase the site and began construction in earnest.\n\nOne day, accompanied by his friend, Master Chonglin Daohuan, he carried a volume of texts and surveyed the land, discerning the mountain’s dragon veins with the eye of dharma. Twin peaks rose like hair buns, vying in splendor to the north and south. North of the twin peaks, a path led eastward. The needle pointed to *qian* (northwest), then branched into two arms—one forming a stone arrangement resembling the character *pin* (品), its three faces jagged yet upright. Perhaps heaven and earth had nurtured this numinous formation, awaiting its destined purpose.\n\nDuring the Yongjia era of the Jin, a recluse surnamed Yu crossed the river and built his hut here. Inspired by the *pin*-shaped stones, he styled himself *Master of the Jade Pin Mountain*, and thus the mountain came to be called *Jade Pin*. *Jade Pin Mountain* was the mountain’s general name. From its summit, a vein emerged from the *pin* formation, winding like a wasp’s waist or a horse’s jaw. Midway, it branched into three peaks, towering and steadfast, their rounded summits firmly planted—these were named *Hanqi* (Shaking Marvel). Proceeding further, the path shifted with each step, its turns resembling oar strokes, and was called *Lianhua* (Lotus Flower). At its terminus, three ridges pressed into the earth, majestic and precipitous, forming the shape of an immortal’s grand seat.\n\nTo the east lay the *Eight Turtles Hall* and *Sizhou Bridge*; to the west, the *Qilin Grotto* and *Zhenwu Crag*. Above the *Mingtang* (Bright Hall) stood mountains named *Huxie* (Gourd Arbor), *Wushi Gang* (Crow Stone Ridge), and *Ancient Pine*. Around the mountain, twin emerald streams meandered in serpentine coils, their every inch spanning a thousand *li*, stretching endlessly into the distance. An outlying peak, *Fangshan* (Square Mountain), rose externally, while internally, *Tianzhu* (Heavenly Pillar) was erected as its support. Below *Tianzhu* lay Yingtian Temple. Two peaks leapt backward, enclosing the water’s tail like a gate, resembling oxen and horses drinking from the stream—playful and full of charm.\n\nSouth of the twin peaks, the path led to *Dazuo Feng* (Grand Seat Peak), *Yuyao Feng* (Jade Medicine Peak), and *Shuangtong Feng* (Twin Youths Peak). Below *Shuangtong* lay *Baotai Feng* (Treasure Terrace Peak), *Qiyun Feng* (Rising Cloud Peak), *Jinlan Feng* (Golden Rail Peak), *Sanlang Feng* (Third Son Peak), and *Chaoyang Feng* (Facing Sun Peak). These peaks stood in imposing array, their spires clashing like antlers. Beyond them, the horizon stretched unbroken in all four directions.\n\nWhen Master Yun of Zhishan’s *Bieshan* (Separate Mountain) Lodge visited, he composed a *gatha* on the *Ten Marvelous Peaks* to express his sentiments. All who climbed and explored the site could not help but praise it. Having acquired the land, the Master set about construction in grand fashion, orienting the sanctuary to face southeast with its back to the northwest. Pointing to the extraordinary site, he exclaimed, “Who has led me to delight in this land and take the initiative? Is this not the karmic affinity of a sanctuary?”\n\nThe Master’s conduct and practices astonished all who heard or saw him. Though he wished to conceal himself and leave no trace, he found that even in the absence of traces, concealment was impossible. The leading figures of various schools, unwilling to let him go, invited him to Dongyue Mountain Temple and presented him with hundreds of sheets of calligraphy. Dongyue Temple lay north of Fuzhou’s administrative seat, adjacent to the clamor of markets and dust. Those of shallow learning and limited vision who dwelled there were inevitably bound by attachments. Yet the Master’s nature was unadorned and free, devoid of form, thought, knowledge, or attainment. Only the thought of establishing a sanctuary never ceased; he longed to fulfill this aspiration but could not bear the burden alone.\n\nIn the *yiwei* year (1315), he entrusted his disciples, led by Master Long, to oversee the project. Construction began on a certain day, month, and *jiazi* cycle, with rituals performed and ground broken. Walls were raised and huts built atop the site, and the sanctuary was named *Shoutian Yuyan Daochang* (Longevity and Heavenly Jade Cliff Daoist Sanctuary). *Shoutian* (Longevity Heaven) shared the same lineage as *Yingtian* (Responding Heaven), while *Yuyan* (Jade Cliff) was derived from the name *Jade Pin Mountain*.\n\nAt its center stood a hall named *Yingji* (Responding to Opportunity). Behind the hall was the *Guanyin Hall*, and behind that, two chambers were built to honor his masters—one named *Dongshan Shouyu* (Longevity Domain of Dongshan), the other *Yuzhong Guizang* (Returning to Repose of Yuzhong). The Master did not claim this sanctuary for himself but dedicated it to his two teachers, thereby demonstrating his unwavering devotion to his lineage.\n\nBeneath the hall, earth was excavated to form a pond, broad at the edges and deep at the center. Springs were channeled to fill it, its waters neither increasing nor decreasing. Nine grades of lotus flowers bloomed there, their varieties distinct yet sharing the same fragrance. When the nine merged into one, their wonder defied description—was this not the essence of *Jade Pin*? The mountain’s veins originated from three stones above, three peaks in the middle, and three branches below, totaling nine—hence the division into nine grades, a numerological significance drawn from this.\n\nThe lotus pond derived its name from the mountain’s *Lianhua* (Lotus Flower) peak. Moreover, the Master’s lineage traced back to *Tianchi* (Heavenly Pool), and thus he named the pond after those two characters. The mountain’s orientation aligned with *qian* (northwest) and *hai* (north), corresponding to the names of heaven and earth—truly a harmonious resonance.\n\nBeside the pond stood a pavilion, and the pavilion’s structure included a terrace. Flowers and trees were planted, their fragrance perfuming the four seasons. This was a sight to inspire admiration in all who visited—how could one not delight in such a place?\n\nAs for the three hundred *mu* of land set aside for vegetarian offerings, they provided resources for incense and lamps, fulfilling the Golden Immortal’s teaching of the *unfailing mind*.",

Furthermore, at the foot of Chaoyang Mountain, he established a burial mound as a cavern for dwelling in truth—was this not also in accord with the Golden Immortal’s teaching of the Dharma of quiescent extinction? Was the Master not a disciple of the Golden Immortal?\n\nIn the third year of the Dade era, in the ji-hai year, six days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Master sent Dao Huan to present me with a map of the land and request a record, saying: “The construction of the hermitage is nearly complete. I have also purchased the neighboring land, acquiring the foundations of former worthies. Though it is now an overgrown wasteland, this too is the legacy of Tang Chengyi. I have already begun clearing and cultivating it, estimating labor and materials to build a great Buddha hall, modeled after the finest monastic halls, to pray for the eternal peace of our present emperor. Thus may the faithful of the countryside find a place of refuge.

      "translated_text": "I, who am I? A son of the Xu family of Guangling, my name and style lost to time, my origins recorded in the *Genealogies of the Five Dynasties* under the Qi lineage. I call myself the Hermit of Biefeng Mountain. Here I gather these matters and set them down in record. The Master had the words carved upon stone, leaving them to show to later generations.\n\n*Continuation of the Inscription for the Shoutian Yuyan Daoist Sanctuary*\n\nThe meaning of the character \"Buddha\" is explained as \"not-human.\" Being \"not-human,\" it has no roof above, no shelter below, no walls in the ten directions, no gates on four sides. Taking the three-thousandfold great-thousandfold world as its vastness—who knows what transient combination this is?\n\nThe *Diamond Sutra* says: \"It is not adornment; this is called adornment.\" This is why it is called Buddha, for the Buddha-mind shines universally.\n\nThe transmission of the Sixth Patriarch’s robe and bowl followed in due order. First, he received the teaching from Zhen of Dongshan, residing at Yingtian Temple. Then, the seal was passed to Zhigong of Yuzhong, who dwelled at Yueshan Temple. The morning bell and evening drum were enough to bring ease and contentment.\n\nYet on Yupin Mountain, he built a hermitage called the Shoutian Yuyan Daoist Sanctuary. Was this merely for hauling firewood and carrying water, or to display supernatural powers? Every beam and tile, every timber and stone, were all personally handled by the Master. I say his effort was both laborious and clumsy.\n\nWhen the hermitage was completed, he asked me to record its history. To record is one thing; to add words of praise is another. Yet I could not escape the worldly habit. The Master’s mind, like Han’s horses or Xue’s cranes, was already complete in itself.\n\nThe structures included: one grand hall as the largest; two halls for the Dharma and for repose; three for the spirit assembly. There were gates and corridors, long verandas and side halls. There were granaries, storehouses, kitchens, and monastic cells. The abbot’s quarters stood square and solid, resplendent in their completeness—nine out of ten things were in place.\n\nThe earthworkers, carpenters, and stonemasons were nearly finished—seven or eight out of ten tasks done. Counting backward, it had taken four, five, or six years to complete. One can imagine the grandeur of its construction.\n\nI say the Master’s effort was still laborious and clumsy. When he commanded me to continue the record, I feared I might fail to capture the true intent behind it. Have you not seen Master Cen? He said, \"This is a man of the present age—he must hide himself away.\" Can you fathom this?\n\nThe Master sat in silent meditation. In an instant, he raised a staff and shouted: \"Though the hermitage is small, it contains the Dharma-realm. Open it wide—nothing is beyond its vastness. Draw it in—nothing is within its smallness.\"",

      "translated_text": "Such words are no Dharma-case of Bodhidharma—do you grasp them?\n\nIn my eyes and ears, the sound alone pierced through. Thus I knew that the Master’s construction of this Dao-chamber was no different in scale from the Jetavana Monastery built by the Buddha. Was the Master’s purpose in erecting this Dao-chamber truly here? If not here, then it resided solely within the square inch of the heart.\n\nIts framework defies measurement by foot or yard. Its orientation eludes the compass’s needle. Its realm transcends the wild vastness of unhewn stone. Its artistry surpasses the towering steepness of the Ten Peaks, its depth beyond the abyss of the Twin Streams—no source can be fathomed. How fine, how excellent—all virtues □□.\n\nIf one can comprehend this, one sees that the entire earth is a monastic ground. One eye opened wide, the other roams freely. Eastward, no bounds; westward, no limits; upward, it props up the heavens; downward, it props up the earth—unobstructed in all four directions, eight reaches. Its radiance shines brilliantly, illuminating the ten directions, like a thousand suns casting boundless light. Otherwise, how could it be called *The Master of Universal Illumination of the Buddha-Mind*?\n\nThe Dao-chamber is built—how could it be easy? To record this is to inscribe its intent. I dare not overstep the Master’s gate. Borrowing Mount Sumeru as a peak, the ocean’s waters as ink, and a great slab of stone from Lion Rock, I inscribe and erect this stele, so that for a hundred million kalpas to come, unbroken and indestructible, it may proclaim the purpose behind *The Master of Universal Illumination of the Buddha-Mind* and the *Record of the Jade Crag Dao-Chamber of Longevity and Heaven*.\n\nThe hermitage’s history has been recorded before; thus, I compose this eulogy:\n\nMaster Cong, styled Stone Path,\nHailing from Putian, bearing his surname to the end.\nA scholar by family tradition, clad in noble robes—\nYet hills and valleys shift, literary stars fade.\nThe world’s tides surge, but he did not contend.\nUnadorned and pure, such was his true nature.\nHis studies refined, he turned to the Western Sage.\nIn a single moment of insight, not through mirrors or towers,\nHe traced the source’s flow, a lineage of endurance.\nThe Eastern Mountain’s revival—he received the touch of ordination.\nFrom fool to sage, he transmitted the true seal.\nFirst serving in the capital, praised for his talent,\nNow in Yue’s mountains, leading the multitudes.\nHe founded the Dao-chamber, divining Jade Crag.\nDragons received the Dharma, the lineage unified.\nThe dense forest gleams, the canon corrected.\nQi congeals, stone □□.\nTwin streams flow, ten peaks arrayed.\nFacing southeast, peerless in splendor.\nExcavating earth, clearing obstructions,\nMolding bricks, hewing beams steady.\nRaising walls, planting screens,\nThe hermitage complete, Chan calm and still.\nIts name fitting its purpose, inscribed upon the hall.\nExotic lotuses bloom in the pond’s long furrows.\nPavilions stand like tripods among flowers and trees.\nTwo masters’ shrines, revered with devotion.\nThe living thrive, the departed rejoice.\nYear after year, offerings made—this record was my request.\nNeighbors settled, labor and land combined.\nEarth, wood, stone—craftsmanship ever vigorous.\nOne hall, open and expansive.\nThree chambers, where Dharma-clouds repose.\nCorridors stretch, long and straight.\nJoints precise, doors aligned.\nGranaries filled, kitchens pristine.\nQuarters and rooms, all in perfect order.\nFields of two or three *qing*,\nOne stupa mound—all affairs settled.\nDisciples Long and others, following the Master’s command,\nFive or six years—work at last complete.\nOpen one eye, observe closely:\nThe Master’s dwelling—realm or no-realm?\nWithin the square inch of the heart, traces of labor vanish.\nA single point of light, ever bright,\nPermeating the Dharma-realm, towering ten thousand *ren*.\nThe Buddha came from the West—what cultivation, what realization?\nWater in the vase, stars on the scale.\nSilent, then speaking—suddenly, self-awareness.\nWhat is the meaning? Pure faith arises.\nRobes may spread wide, draped over Mount Dayu’s ridge.\nContinuing the lamp’s lineage, the flame never extinguished.\nMind is Buddha—no comparison suffices.\nCalled *Universal Illumination*, the two resonate.\nThe Master’s subtlety—let all listen closely.\nThis record’s intent—my dullness persists.\nThe eulogy lacks polish, shameful in its crudeness.\nThis stele carved, its years endure.\n\n---\n\n*Record of the Western Grove Monastery*\n\nIn the old customs of Fuzhou’s city in Min, local records speak of the \"Three Mountains.\" According to Guo Pu’s *Relocation of the State’s Land Records*: \"Before it lie the twin brows of a youth, adorned with powder and rouge.\" This refers to Wushi Mountain, Jiuxian Mountain, and Fang Mountain to the north. There are also Gaogai Mountain and Lianhua Mountain, corresponding to Fang Mountain. The name \"Three Mountains\" originates here.\n\nAmong the Three Mountains, Fang Mountain stands most prominently. South of the prefectural seat, it appears like a table—heaven’s craftsmanship, earth’s creation. How could it be merely for the prefecture’s sake?\n\nI have often said that among mountains of numinous wonder, there must emerge people of extraordinary talent, virtue, loyalty, and integrity to match them—yet I had never witnessed it. One day, wandering at the foot of Fang Mountain, after a *li*’s journey, I came upon a Buddhist monastery, coiled and towering, its plaque reading *Western Grove Chan Monastery*. The Dharma-gate vast, halls deep and grand, corridors stretching like wings, pavilions soaring like channels.\n\nTo the east, the *Heavenly Meal Fragrant Accumulation Kitchen*; to the west, the *Cloud Assembly Chan Banquet Hall*. As for the *Arhat Shrine*, *Jeweled Flower Hall*, and *Abbot’s Quarters*—none lacked splendor. Granaries and storied chambers left no space unfilled. Timber, stone, rafters, tiles—whitewashed walls all renewed. Bells, fish-shaped wooden drums—every implement in place.\n\nAs for the pond’s excavation, water channeled to cultivate pure minds—unstained, unsoiled, this is called adornment. The azure lotus, the golden Buddha—rays of white light illuminate the ten directions, pervading the three thousand great thousand worlds.\n\nI burned incense, pressed palms together—like ascending to heaven. The four great elements, the five aggregates—truly, nothing exists. I sighed: this is how those who transcend the world achieve merit and renown.\n\nAfter a moment, the abbot emerged, draped in his robe, sleeves holding his sitting mat, and greeted me.",
      "overlap_context": "ffort was still laborious and clumsy. When he commanded me to continue the record, I feared I might fail to capture the true intent behind it. Have you not seen Master Cen? He said, \"This is a man of the present age—he must hide himself away.\" Can you fathom this?\n\nThe Master sat in silent meditation. In an instant, he raised a staff and shouted: \"Though the hermitage is small, it contains the Dharma-realm. Open it wide—nothing is beyond its vastness. Draw it in—nothing is within its smallness.\"",

      "translated_text": "I beheld the man—his bearing open and forthright, free of self-and-other distinctions. Bowing, I asked: “Master, were you the founder of this mountain temple?” He invited me to sit, brewed tea in welcome, and spoke unhurriedly: “The temple’s founding master was the patriarch of the Tang’s Guangming era. A century later, Chan Master Jingde of the Song expanded it into a proper sanctuary. Counting the years to now, more than three hundred springs and autumns have passed. In the Xianchun year of *wuchen*, this old monk came from Longjiang and dwelt on the mountain for a full decade. Just then, war broke out, reducing all to ruins and overgrown wilderness—passersby could only sigh. Without consulting others or seeking aid, I emptied my own robes and alms-bowl, single-handedly shouldering the task. Hoarding what little surplus I had, treating it as personal wealth, I hired laborers and artisans upon the old site. Through years of toil and service, I at last achieved this restoration. I added fields to the holdings, bringing greater benefit than before, merely to sustain the morning incense and evening lamps for the assembly. Above, I pray for the sovereign’s longevity; below, I offer the villagers a refuge within the Buddha’s Dharma. Thus may I face without shame the two founding masters, Guangming and Jingde.\n\nWithin the abbot’s quarters, I built a hall and erected a pagoda, arraying the ocean-wide assembly of past generations to left and right. Above, I sculpted the Three Buddhas; below, I designated a single niche as the *spirit chamber*, where the true returns to its source—this fulfills this old monk’s vow. Now I wish to quarry mountain stone and inscribe the years, that future eyes may know the origins of this place. Having long heard of your true goodness, I wished to learn of the causes and conditions of the *Empty School’s* teachings—how fitting! With Mount Sumeru as my brush and the sea as ink, I could compose but a few lines, no different from speech. As you offer skillful means, I dare not refuse.”\n\nThus I replied: “Excellent! Excellent! The master’s name is Zheng Rong. His ancestors hailed from the old county of Changle, bearing the surname Xie. Though his family had long been scholars, he was one of those rare, loyal, and virtuous men who could forsake the world and yet attain merit and renown.”\n\nHaving recorded this, I let out a long whistle and stepped outside—no one knew where I had gone. The master said: “How spirit-like!”",

      "translated_text": "Amidst the decayed chessboard of the *Burnt Axe*, one may learn from the woodcutter to steal a moment’s leisure. Where rocks stand jagged, they form the chambers of Daoist adepts; where grasses grow thick and wild, they become the hermit’s thatched hut. Here is a seat for meditation, there a terrace for ascending transcendence. Once the auspicious glow of heavenly lanterns appeared; once the alchemical cinnabar of the immortal’s crucible lingered. The echoes of stone drums still resound, the scars of sword-stones remain etched. Narrow and perilous paths are called the *Gates of Drawn Battle*; broad and level expanses serve as *Bays for Resting Horses*. These are not empty words—how could I speak falsely of ancient traces? Yet why this sigh of emotion? Surely they are still there to behold.\n\nLofty, lofty—cliffs too sheer to scale. Deep, deep—pools without bottom. Each stands in its depth or shallowness, dividing into two or three. Orchids and angelicas share fragrance, rich and dense; wisteria and creepers intertwine in emerald tangle. Springs gush forth in ceaseless flow, their murmuring currents soft and clear. A single waterfall hangs from cliffs ten thousand feet high—white as silk, blue as indigo. When it scatters, its droplets are round as pearls; when it surges, its depths are vast as a basin. No golden blade could so easily cut it, no jade ruler could truly measure it.\n\nAt times, a divine dragon transforms—now dim, now bright. It soars, it dives; it emerges, it vanishes. Now it lashes forth as thunder and lightning, now it rears as *□* and *□*. Now rain pours down in torrents, now clouds rise in gentle swells. Its shrine is grandly enfeoffed, and the people never grow weary of reverence.\n\nWhen chaos first parted and the earliest ages began, who shaped this place? Adorning the earth with beauty, it lay beyond the Qin capital, outside the Han maps. Ruling over Nanyue, only King Wuzhu resisted the topknots and barbaric customs. Guarding this corner of the world, he concealed his light and hid his tracks—who dared praise him, who dared blame?\n\nFrom the *Zhenguan* era of Tang, it was named an *Upper Capital*. Its reputation was grand, its bearing majestic. Like a slope rising abruptly amid miles of plain, it gathers verdant hues and spreads like a market, embracing the tidal roar like a basin. Its mound is called *Passing the Rammed Earth*; its ridge is named *Incense Burner*. Behold the whiteness of its waters, the blackness of its stones. The front ocean serves as its elbow and armpit; the rich mountains as its toes and instep. Here, upon this land, these people till their fields and build their homes.\n\nYet how the hills have shifted and valleys changed, how times alter and affairs diverge! In the Five Dynasties’ chaos, ten clans drove forward together. Who could have foreseen the Wang family, calling themselves the humble and foolish? Within, they drowned in excess; without, they imposed heavy levies. Palaces knew no bounds; hunting and pleasure were their sole delight. No fixed seasons, no rest from toil. Birds took flight in alarm, beasts fled in terror—life nearly ceased. Mountains were left barren, forests stripped—all turned to desolate mounds.\n\nWas it not the Su clan’s repeated rise that withered the Eyebrow Mountain? As the saying goes, the matter is no lie. From *Jianlong* to *Xiangfu*, the court’s civil rule flourished; village schools and classical learning thrived. In time, great scholars and renowned officials emerged, aiding and promoting one another without hesitation. This place led all prefectures, breaking through the path to office. Crimson and purple adorned their backs; carriages and horses filled their gates.\n\nOnce, this peak’s numen shone through the excellence of things. Now, this peak’s essence resides in the store of men. Alas! North and south, east and west—time flows like the shuttle, yet this peak does not age. Entrusted with divinity, it was granted noble rank. Its honors increased, its wisdom never faltered, guiding people toward goodness. Though the literary spirit has not perished, the Dao hides in secrecy, subtle and obscure. I know my account may seem strange, fearing it borders on the dubious. I feel great shame before Cao Zhi’s grand principles, deep regret before Zuo Si’s decade of toil. Let this be my *Capture of the Unicorn* brush—lest it invite the scorn of being fit only to cover a wine jar.\n\n*Ode to the Lingji Palace*\n\nDragons carve tortoises, turtles peddle books—how strange and uncanny! In the *Taiyuan* era of the *Jiao* dynasty, silence was not the way; I sought answers in the earliest images. Fu Xi and Nü Wa questioned the cause, yet remained dim and unenlightened. Only when the dark crow’s revelation came did they suddenly create and return to it. In profound obscurity, the craft of Chui aligned the compass—patterns emerged, intent was set. This was no mere omen from banquet mats or wine vessels; that numinous breath remained unknowable.\n\nI observe the reclusive one, faint and indistinct, guarding the profound mystery in silence. Lightning flashes and vanishes in an instant—how fleeting! To fathom the universe is to reach its limits—who can foresee its end? Like the earth itself, it stretches without bound. Thus the Five Emperors stand tall, the Three Sovereigns unfold in succession. Divine parks have their regulations, sacred halls their standards. Treading the present with measured steps, who now strays or falters?\n\nThe nine heavens stretch vast and distant—where to place, where to attach? Why descend so sharply to dwell upon Bie Peak? Ascending winding paths to the splendid altar, I arrive at dawn’s first light. Heaven gazes down from azure heights; earth is piled into hills and mountains. Clouds twist and waves writhe—its foundations coil and twist, beginning in Dongping. Tracing back to the Tang’s sudden *□*, its roots split the tripod to form peaks. Towering, like a docile camel’s team; lofty, like a crimson steed and azure dragon.\n\nBeholding the winding streams of lotus blossoms, I draw in pure numen and feel my heart refreshed. The sacred mountain’s *□* stands majestic, draped in lush, verdant qi. The nine wards and nine paths spread in disarray, like wells and houses linked in rows. Morning tides, evening ebbs—Dao flows vast and surging. Truly, mountains and rivers, earth spirits and ghosts, the Queen Mother nurtures the numinous.\n\nIn the *Zhenghe* era, officials were consulted to build it. Its solemn uprightness was grand; earth, wood, and stonework stood firm. Yet the columns of whetstone gleam, the carved jade pillars rise sheer. Flying eaves soar, tiered roofs ascend. Layered beams and interlocking brackets spread like wings, rich and intricate. Double rafters and stacked arches rise ever higher, tier upon tier.",

I sigh that the months and years have fled.\nThus, with a single note of the flute, I join the cowherds in returning home.",

      "translated_text": "The vermilion gates of layered pavilions unfold grandly, their grandeur rivaling the stone drums of Qiyang. The low walls and embankments stand in splendid ruggedness, resplendent in red and blue. Secret chambers and secluded halls loom jagged and deep, stretching into the boundless haze. The eastern corridors and western wings rise in towering succession, embracing the land’s contours in mutual embrace.\n\nHere too are screens of kingfisher feathers and pearls, silken nets of peacock plumes in ordered ranks, and golden geese unfurled. Embroidered hems are stitched, woven mats spread beneath. They receive the sacred talismans of Mount Gou, moved by the golden vines of Manlu. Yet these are not enough to evoke antiquity—interspersed with glistening glass, they weave a tapestry of splendor.\n\nVermilion lingzhi clouds surge in swirling mists; auspicious incense from Boshan censers billows thick and fragrant. The wind sings through jade-railed cedar and pine; the moon hangs upon the patterned windows of locust and cassia. Some enclose earth to pool springs, their murmuring waters alive with rippling currents. Carp and mandarin fish dart through clear eddies, their tails flashing. The passage of accumulated blessings opens vast, gathering the great thousand worlds into a single grain.\n\nThe Dragon’s Head Peak soars to towering heights, its lofty summits circling the numinous pagoda. Outer structures link in endless succession, front and rear merging seamlessly. Forms vary, sights diverge—none can be fully described. Even the steps ascend in graded ranks; the guards’ formations follow strict commands. To the left, voices hush; to the right, silence reigns. The demons and specters stand firm, their shoulders laden with shields and spears. Harshly they bar the way, permitting no breath of disobedience. The reckless halt, hands bound, awaiting orders.\n\nOn the eve of rituals, vigil is kept with utmost care. Heads lift and bow in measured rhythm, advancing and retreating in turn. Faces are composed, expressions solemn. Eyes hold sincerity; reverence is etched in every gesture. The painted figures bristle with ferocity, their fiery auras blazing fiercely—these are the stalwart warriors. Vigilant and imposing, they stand like jade-clad soldiers. Tiger-headed, swallow-chinned, their strategies drawn from dragon’s arts and leopard’s cunning. Bows and arrows arrayed, banners and pennants raised, they wield halberds and brandish axes. Their movements leave no trace, their schemes hidden in the unfathomable. Like the ramparts of a willow camp, they display the order of a well-guarded encampment.\n\nThus they sever ties with factions, distance themselves from distant lands. From remote peaks and across the seas, tribute flows in ceaseless streams. Behold this hall—here guests and envoys find respite. Let it be recorded as a royal assembly, celebrating the Great Peace of this day.\n\nWith reverence, we extol the Emperor: may his reign span ten thousand years, a father and mother to all. Under heaven, all is the sovereign’s domain. He refines culture and stills warfare. Loyalty is his armor, trust his helmet; ritual his shield, righteousness his bulwark. He gathers poets in literary societies, hunts for talent in the forests of words. He roams the ink fields, dispatches envoys to the realm of brush and silk, drawing the multitudes to lofty brilliance. He summons auspicious clouds, □ the white elders. The Eastern Wall shines radiant, a dazzling spectacle to behold.\n\nHow grand! The Lingyan Pavilion, where the finest figures gather, all girded in gold and robed in purple. Like the Western Liang’s lion-dancing Hu, or the acrobats of Xunzhuang, they perform with dazzling agility. Veils swirl, movements blur—mastering the arcane arts of Zanggan, the melodies of the Pear Garden rise in resonant song. Here are the beauties of Chu, the charms of Wu, the maidens of Qin, the sisters of Wei. Powdered faces, dark brows, adorned in silks and brocades, adorned with gold and pearls. They feast on fine delicacies, sated with meat from the imperial cauldrons. Eight treasures flow in abundance, apportioned from the imperial kitchens. The assembled concubines vie in splendor—what path of indulgence is beyond reach? Yet the Emperor’s heart remains discerning, allowing no slack in skill, no laxity in pleasure for the eyes and ears.\n\nThe gates of heaven stand wide, unbarred, with no steps to ascend. The glory of his name and virtue rivals the sun and moon. Even a weight of ten thousand jun would not suffice to measure his worth. Yet how does he govern with effortless ease, ever vigilant as if in fear? He cherishes kin and fosters harmony, reciting the verses of *Famu*. The Lord of Lu feasts in joy, offering the hymns of the *Biyong*. The Hall of Names bears woven characters as its rule. Subtly it conveys its meaning, perhaps nearly enough to warn the multitude of cares.\n\nThe *Yu* dynasty’s omens of loss and gain were once divined—let them serve as a lesson. The literary legacy remains unlost, like Yan and Kong of old. The calligraphy of Huiping and seal scripts of Zhuanxu may be inscribed on the halls of the Xuanyuan. Breathing like bears, still as turtles—observing their techniques, even the later masters Huang, Ren, Xu, and Dong pale in comparison. Who among men could rival this? Only he may be proclaimed and enfeoffed, receiving heaven’s favor.\n\nAgain, the thunder gods are summoned to clear the path with rumbling cries; the rain masters are commanded to wash away the dust. Feilian drives the winds with fierce shouts. Their voices ring out, the Divine Mother hurls her might. The great procession begins, chariots drawn by dragons. Cloud banners flutter, eight simurghs and five phoenixes swirl in abundance. They converge in welcome, ascending on pure qi. The journey presses on, passing through the gates of heaven to reach the Purple Court. There is no pause in coming or going—below, inverted reflections; above, radiant light. A hundred flavors, fine wines offered with fragrant orchids. Though the halls of Du Heng stand serene, how can peace be assured forever? May your sacrifices endure for ten thousand ages.\n\n*Wenxing Hermitage Rhapsody*\nOne day, a gentleman of refined tastes approached me, incense in sleeve, and said: \"In our homeland, palaces and temples each have their steles, and the Hall of Accumulated Blessings has its record. The pagoda of Wenxing Hermitage, as a Daoist sanctuary, cannot be dismissed as insignificant—why not compose a few words for it?\"\n\nI do not dare to lag behind, but as the sanctuary nears ruin, no one has yet emerged to restore it to its former state. Thus, I feel shame. Now, prompted by your inquiry, I gather these details to encourage those with affinity.\n\nThus, I compose this rhapsody:",

      "translated_text": "Turtle Peak rises ten thousand fathoms high, a mere grasp from heaven. Winding its way here, who knows how many rises and falls it has known? Suddenly, it unfurls into three verdant peaks—here stand your hut, your home. Bowing to the encircling ridges in homage, it gazes west and lingers in hesitation.\n\nNo donkey’s hooves could tread this ground—only the dragon and elephant make their dens here. Enshrined within is the Tathāgata’s true relic, each granule gleaming like golden peaches inlaid with jade. Wrapped in felt, bundled in mats, borne by camel from the Western Regions, it was set as the pagoda’s heart. Hewn from the mountain’s stone with water-polished edges, its seven-tiered bones ascend in towering splendor.\n\nA thousand Buddhas manifest in its form, carved with wind-driven chisels and divine precision. A sacred flame burns cold and blue, illuminating the Dipper and Ox stars above. Beheld by humans, devas, ghosts, and spirits, all rejoice in my resolve—though some may fear its fulfillment. Morning and evening, devotees bow in reverence, their devotion deepening at the dark of the moon, its waxing, its waning, and its return.\n\nThis was the former abbot’s hermitage, where the monk Xiū composed his gāthās. A descendant of Bi Gan named Huaixian, he was the village’s pillar of generosity. With the wooden fish’s startling knock, his voice echoed through the night like a mountain crane’s call. His merit perfected in the Hall of Many Fragrances—one bowl, one spoon.\n\nThe stele inscription from the Yuánfú era still marks the years, though words cannot fully capture its tale. Here, I merely sketch its broad strokes. The name *Pure Wisdom* once resounded in antiquity, speaking of the Western Paradise’s bliss. *Wenxing* shines in the present, bearing the intent of the scholar-gentleman.\n\nSome dedicate halls to Confucius, aspiring to learning; others worship the Primal Sovereign, seeking official rank. The Hall of Vast Kindness stands here, the Pavilion of Pure Integrity beside it. To the right, they pay homage to the Dark Heaven; to the left, they gaze upon the Eastern Peak. They invite the guiding masters of Sukhāvatī, seated upon blue lotuses in radiant splendor.\n\nA thousand wheels of wisdom’s power manifest in their forms, unadorned by leaden cosmetics yet draped in jeweled garlands. Like Yuanying’s dazzling white robes, some display their simplicity; like Mingjue’s golden railing’s luster, others proclaim their elegance. Through medicine, they heal and revive the people, needing no ginseng or cassia. Through filial piety, they elevate themselves, transforming the world’s shallow wickedness.\n\nThe hall is named *Assembly of Attainment*, its numinous presence profound. A thousand gates spread like five phoenixes in flight, eaves carved high and intricate. Chambers and storerooms stand in order, kitchens and baths rebuilt anew. Zēng Yóu’s brushwork adorns the halls with murals, though some are marred by time’s soot and whitewash.\n\nWith all vessels prepared, none remain steadfast to exert their strength. Yet each endeavor reaches completion—not through a single morning or evening’s work. Restored in the Xuānhé era by Zhang, Wu, and Guo, it was later expanded by Xu, Zhou, and others. From Yuánfú to Jǐngyán, renovations and renewals have numbered many.\n\nPraise their loyalty and diligence, which shall plant roots for eons as countless as river sands.

      "translated_text": "Today’s absurdities may become tomorrow’s enfeoffments and inherited titles. To regard these as proofs of merit and steps to advancement—such is the ignorance of men like you. In former times, works like the *Soushen Ji*, *Shenyi Zhi*, *Youguai Ji*, *Shanhaijing*, and *Youming Lu* were all dismissed as absurd. Yet today, who reads them without a sigh of admiration? Who would say otherwise?\n\nI have read the words of the Sage: *\"The Master did not speak of prodigies, force, disorder, or spirits.\"* Yet in the *Capture of the Lin* and the *Oaths of Alliance*, omens and portents appear repeatedly, recorded without omission. Some criticize these passages, attributing them to the mouths of Gongyang, Zuoshi, and Guliang. But the one who first shaped such accounts cannot evade responsibility—hence the saying: *\"Those who understand me do so through the* Spring and Autumn Annals; *those who condemn me do so through the* Spring and Autumn Annals.\"* How profound is the difficulty of discerning true talent!\n\nLiterature is the public instrument of the world; if it is not in error, what need is there for debate? My own works—I know not whether they are right or wrong. I ask only that they be examined. When Duan Wenchang composed the *Stele of Pingcai*, Prefect Chen Xiang removed it, valuing only the prose of Han Changli. Though Changli is revered by later generations, how could he not know what Su the Academician meant when he said: *\"I do not know if the world contains verses like Duan Wenchang’s—how does he compare to Duan Wenchang?\"* My own works, though lacking Duan Wenchang’s talent, may be preserved; they must not be discarded. If they are cast aside, even if this record remains, who will speak for it?\n\nI do not seek to preserve these writings to boast before the present age, dazzle future generations, or deceive the ears of the multitude. Rather, when later men attend to the temple rites, reading my record and witnessing my conduct, they will not deceive themselves in the darkness but feel reverence for the spirits arise naturally within them. Since the record is already written, it must be engraved and transcribed—only the right person can be entrusted with this task. Thus, I dare to appeal to your judgment, certain that you will have your reasons.\n\nDongpo once said: *\"In my life, I have never composed eulogies, epitaphs, or tomb steles for others.\"* Yet when he wrote the biographies of Minister Sima Wen and Duke Fu Han, he declared: *\"I dared not firmly refuse, though it was not my true inclination.\"* If you undertake this stele, is it not to assume the role Dongpo claimed for himself?\n\nNevertheless, Cai Yong said to Lu Zhi: *\"I have written many steles and records, all with some regret—only the* Stele for Guo Youdao *leaves me without shame.\"* I dare make this plea with the same conviction.\n\n*A Treatise to Silence Slander*",

      "translated_text": "Since assuming my sacred office in the Dao, after universally delivering all beings, I have never once engaged in worldly intercourse. Even when I have uttered a few words or penned a single character, they have been nothing but inducements toward goodness. Yet if the recipient’s essence is not pure enough to resonate, no sign or omen will respond. As for floods, droughts, epidemics, or unforeseen calamities—these are all due to my own lack of virtue. I can only tremble in fear, reflect deeply, and exhaust every means of averting and dispelling them.\n\nImpartial and selfless, I answer doubts as swiftly as an echo. Yet today’s scribes and chroniclers cannot be trusted, for among them lurk those who fabricate illusions—crafty deceivers who borrow the guises of fox spirits and rat demons. They peer through doors, lurk in empty chambers, and embellish their tales, casting lines to hook the gullible and boast of their exploits. How can they claim that men may be deceived, yet the gods deceived as well? As the saying goes: *\"One may be fooled, but not utterly deluded.\"* Fish eyes and true pearls—genuine and counterfeit are plain to see. Let the discerning not be led astray, lest they bring shame upon the divine.\n\nThus, I set down these words to silence slander:\n\n*The gods inquire in mystery, dwelling in the unseen.*\n*How then do brushstrokes transform, their numen sharp and bright?*\n*Strung like pearls, inlaid with jade, they gleam like sun and stars.*\n*Ban and Zhang’s steeds were unmatched, their worth beyond compare.*\n*The life-saving scriptures of Han Kang endure like flowing streams.*\n*Guo Jingchun’s geomancy charts the hidden paths of yin and yang.*\n*Followers throng with provisions, their carriages blocking the gates.*\n*Virtue engraved in human hearts shall last ten thousand years.*\n\nYet now it is otherwise: the divine conceals itself in heaven.\nAppearing without, vanishing within—such is called immortality.\nVague and indistinct, silent and wordless.\nWho could have foreseen that night-rats would borrow the fox’s cry,\nTwisting truth into confusion, stirring men’s indignation?\nSeeking the gods’ favor, they prepare offerings, both male and female.\nWhose fault is this? The wretched knave, severed and cast aside—\n*\"One may be deceived, but not utterly deluded.\"*\nDare they mock me? Let their sins accumulate until their bodies perish,\nPunished by men and cursed by ghosts.\n\nYou scholars in your caps, shaped like men yet not men—\nDo you think the gods, ever-changing, are deaf to your schemes?\nOnce revered, now you scramble for profit.\nOnce obscure, now your temple rites are complete.\nSelf-promoting, self-hawking—only the gods are shamed.\nI lay down my brush and sing, a song long familiar to men’s ears:\n\n*I sing to warn you: do not follow deceit.*\n*This text is written to silence slander.*\n\n*Not a divine decree, but a verse like Nüwa’s severing the turtle’s legs—*\n*When primordial chaos first parted from Mount Song and Tai.*\n*The towering peaks of Heng and Hua—*\n*Their gods are called Di and Zhi.*\n*Shun piled wood for sacrifice, Yu made his inspections;*\n*Qin performed the feng rites, Han offered their prayers.*\n*Yet the transmission of the rightful succession remains unproven—*\n*Who claims it was a water dragon or a wooden kui?*\n\n*My origins in this world began in Xiaopi.*\n*My spirit conceived at Caishi, nurtured by the marvels of Biefeng.*\n*Alas, in the fleeting moment of soul’s destruction and spirit’s dissolution,*\n*I was summoned from the dark void to gallop through the unseen.*\n*Mourning the desolation of the sacred temple,*\n*I gaze at the abandoned halls, their grandeur faded.*\n*I long to cast off my cap and tear my robes,*\n*To see the treacherous paths of the world.*\n*The great edifice is collapsing, yet none tend to it—*\n*I fear a single timber cannot prop it up.*\n*In the year of* zhaoyang *and* dahuangluo*,*\n*I sharpen my wits by Luochi.*\n*Wielding the writing brush as my voice,*\n*I invert truth to expose beauty and ugliness.*\n*Some slander with cunning, clamoring loudly,*\n*Claiming I deceive with flattery.*\n*Flourishing their tongues like petals and leaves,*\n*They prattle on like Qin’s courtiers.*\n*You, silent and composed, why not stand firm in integrity?*\n*Small as a gourd ladle or a midge,*\n*How can you fathom the depths with a well’s narrow gaze?*\n*Your bellies swollen with parasites,*\n*You are no match for the wine-skin’s capacity.*\n*The sprouts of* nie *valleys perish by dawn—*\n*What use are the short-lived fox’s shadow-watching schemes?*\n*Heaven and earth stretch boundless, without end;*\n*Life and death surge vast—who can comprehend them?*\n*Ruan Zhan’s debates on right and wrong—*\n*His bones now crumble to dust.*\n*If you say my words lack proof,*\n*Then take the sorcerer’s new wheat as your omen.*\n*It is said: Heaven’s Way blesses the good and punishes the wicked,*\n*As surely as a shadow follows its form.*\n*Those who scheme and feign madness,*\n*Waver like foxes, full of doubt.*\n*Revere the gods as if they stand beside you—*\n*I remain silent. What more can I say?*\n\n*Do Not Destroy the Stele*\nTo destroy the stele is to say it must not be destroyed.\nThe *ci* are the words that voice its transgressions.\nThese words say:\n\n*How extreme the deceit of the age has become—*\n*Cunning as rats, clever as macaques.*\n*With gardenia faces and waxen tongues,*\n*You mimic the whispers of your ilk.*\n*Your clever paintings strive to surpass dogs and horses,*\n*Yet only ghosts and demons occupy your designs.*\n*You avoid the great paths to tread the fish and waterfowl’s way,*\n*Yet know well the dangers of the road.*\n*The ranks of the dark and numinous are dense—*\n*They are not like trees, devoid of spirit.*\n*Pity the firefly chasing the dark,*\n*Calling the long night endless.*\n*You beast-faced, speaking like men—*\n*Are you not mere apes?*\n*Can pythons truly swallow deer?*\n*They only twist and shed their scales.*\n*You cultivate bravery by shooting at ramie,*\n*Yet Yi was ultimately trapped in his own body.*\n*Defiling wealth, you suffer calamity—*\n*Chong’s greed surpassed even his love for wife and child.*\n*When evil accumulates, it harms the full,*\n*Yet you cover it with praise and resent the record.*\n*You carve your clan’s precious stone,*\n*Listening to the wails of your ancestors.*\n*The sun sets in a haze of yellow,*\n*Suddenly scorching the parched east.*\n*Behold the net of heaven, its cords spread wide—*\n*Who can escape its three-sided snare?*\n*Blowing on cold ashes to make soup,*\n*You cling to the heat, refusing to wake.*\n*No model to follow, you trace the steps of Han’s fools.*\n*Stalking the tripod’s power in secret,*\n*Why prattle on with your mouths?*\n*Before the drum is buried, its sound is scorched by the sun.*\n*Flames blaze—why heed women’s slander?*\n*The loyal hearts of great generals burn bright—*\n*Why repent of others’ schemes?*\n*The public’s judgment has its merits and flaws—*\n*It is not bias that favors Han.*\n*Moved by the wheel’s hub, I reflect—*\n*Knowing the Creator’s preferences.*\n\n*(End of translation)*",

      "translated_text": "Since last autumn through winter, and now into the third month of spring, not a single drop of rain has fallen, and no seeds have been sown in the earth. Truly, this is a time of dire peril and urgent crisis—who would dare to slaughter geese and soften their blood in sacrifice? To place trust in snake-oil healers would only invite ridicule from those of discernment. Yet it was said: we had heard that within the Chan Master’s sleeve, indolent dragons could be summoned, and with a whip’s command, made to obey. Thus, we came to pay homage and beseech our Master. Following his chariot, rain fell on the day after the *renyin* day, a gentle drizzle spreading in all directions. By the *bingwu* day, the rains had come in full. Young and old alike leapt for joy, their delight mingling in celebration. They declared: *\"The Perfected One has opened the mountain rains!\"* And so, they offered incense and chanted praises.\n\n**Record of the Eastern Well’s Restoration**\nThe Eastern Well’s origins are recorded in stone inscriptions, which state: *\"In the eighth year of the Xining reign, the year *yimao*, on the thirteenth day of the intercalary eighth month, *yisi*,\"*—two hundred and twenty-four years have passed since then. Before the Xining era, when the well’s bricks were first laid, its masonry and railings still stood, bearing the inscription: *\"Zhang Jue donates the Eastern Well’s railing\"* in six characters. Jue was a man of virtuous renown during the Five Dynasties period. By reckoning, this was the eighth year of the Tianfu reign of the Later Jin, the first year of Tiande in Min—spanning, in total, three hundred and sixty-seven years. For all things, long duration leads to decay: such is the nature of fate. Yet decay may be repaired: this, too, is fate’s design.\n\nThe well had silted and collapsed for over forty years, and the simple folk of the village, though not negligent, knew not how to address it. Below, the pit yawned like a bottomless abyss; above, the crumbling edge hung like a sheer cliff, on the verge of breaking yet still clinging—so treacherous that no hand could find purchase. Then, on the second day before the Dragon Boat Festival in the first year of the Dade reign, *wushen*, as the sun neared its setting, a sudden wind and rain arose, and in an instant, the site was reduced to a wasteland of mud and shattered stone. Heaven seemed to lend its hand, compelling men to restore it—truly, this was fate’s decree.\n\nWhere there is land, there are people. And the people belong to Heaven. Blessed by Heaven’s fortune, in harmony with Heaven’s timing, and aligned with Heaven’s will, they consulted the omens and found them auspicious. Four days later, on the *yichou* day, laborers were gathered. With no other means, they hauled stones and cleared mud. To the north, on the sunny slope of Bie Peak, grew a vine as thick as seven or eight inches in diameter, its length straight and uncoiled, stretching over seven or eight *zhang*. They used it as a rope—what marvelous craftsmanship of creation! Could this not be Heaven’s aid to its people?\n\nBy the seventh day of the month, *jiawu*, stonemasons and earthworkers had assembled, and by *yisi*, the work was complete. Does this not mirror the *yisi* day of the well’s original founding? Or was it Heaven’s doing? It was Heaven’s.",

      "translated_text": "Here follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nDare I record these events in writing, to show the people and invoke the spirits? The words read:\n\nHeaven aids its people,\nWind and rain respond in kind.\nProphecies align with spirits,\nAnd thus the work began.\nOnce dredged, it draws from the depths,\nIts hidden flow reaching the Milky Way.\nNurturing people and aiding all things,\nIts merit and use are vast.\nThe eight spirits of the eight directions,\nThe royal kin and the mighty sword.\nWith martial clamor and military might,\nThey ward off misfortune and banish ill omens.\nPeople receive its blessings,\nYears yield abundant grain.\nDrinking from the spring, they know its pulse,\nEnveloped in Heaven’s grace.\nRestoring the old and renewing the well,\nThe task is thus accomplished.\nMay peace and tranquility endure forever—\n*Qian*: Origin, prosperity, harmony, and constancy.\n\n**Sealing the Well: An Inscription**\nThe meaning of the well is profound indeed.\nIn the heavens, it belongs to the twenty-eight constellations;\nIn the Five Phases, it is the essence of water;\nFor people, it serves the needs of drink and sustenance, indispensable even for a single day.\nThe well cannot be abandoned because its waters nurture people and aid all things.\nYet if it becomes silted and unclean, old and murky, it becomes a forsaken well.\nThus, the sages, in composing the hexagrams, declared:\n*A well silted is undrinkable; an old well attracts no birds.*\nThis is precisely because an old, forsaken well’s mud is unfit to drink.\nAs for birds and beasts not coming—it cannot nurture people or aid all things, but instead harms them.\n\nTo the east of the lane lies the temple grounds, where the mountain rises from Bie Peak, winding and undulating, its rises and falls uncounted, until it settles here. Long ago, someone quarried the mountain to dig a well, excavating until the spring was reached, nearly nine *ren* deep. Yet they feared abandoning the work, for their heart was set on nurturing people and aiding all things—even if it meant wounding the mountain, no harm was done.\n\nBut now, one enters the well yet cannot draw water. The well’s purpose is lost.\nThe thirsty cannot drink,\nThe soiled cannot cleanse.\nThe frogs in its depths fall silent,\nThe fish in its dried ruts nearly perish.\nLeft unused, it has lain thus for years.\nThe diviners call it the *Black Warrior pierced by an arrow*,\nThe physicians, a chronic ailment of the vital organs.\nThe clamor of opinions is great—this mountain has suffered no small wound.\n\nSince then, customs have changed, and the village has withered.\nMen of great talent, now impoverished gentlemen, bear no radiant glory.\nThe withering, the decay, the drowning in this—what could be worse?\nWhom to blame? The fault lies with the well.\n\nIn the ninth month of the *gui-si* year of the Zhiyuan era, on the auspicious *bing-zi* day, the villagers proposed sealing the well. They prayed to me, and I answered: \"Sealing it is auspicious.\" Thus, I compose this text to inform the well’s spirit:\n\nLong ago, Geng Gong dug a well fifteen *zhang* deep. He straightened his robes, bowed, and the well gushed forth with water. Yet when Prefectural Clerk Zhu Bo took up residence in an office with over a hundred chambers, all the wells ran dry. Both were wells—why did one benefit Geng Gong but not Zhu Bo? Was this partiality?\n\nMay the well’s spirit lower its head and heed this command, replying: \"It is not partiality, but fate.\nThat there was water was fate;\nThat there was none was also fate.\nTo open it when there was water, to seal it when there was none—this is proper.\nWhat concern is it to the spirits?\"\n\nYet where fate lies, human effort is tied.\nThus, the proposal to seal it arose.\nSeal it, I say:\nOn this day of sealing, spirits will guard it,\nWarding off misfortune and banishing ill omens.\nAfter sealing, may households prosper and suffice,\nMay people live long and in health.\n\n**On the Difficulty of Temple Restoration**\nThe responsibility of restoring the temple is arduous indeed—I have heard as much.\nYear-round labor, endless expenses—\nFrom dawn to dusk, no respite,\nIs it not difficult?\nExhausting ears and eyes, straining strength and thought—\nIs it not hard?\n\nThe rotted and blackened beams and buckets have now been repaired.\nThe broken and missing roof tiles have been restored.\nThe faded red and white hues have been renewed.\nWhose work is this? To call it solely one’s own would be excessive;\nYet one might shirk responsibility and evade the difficulty.\n\nNevertheless, the eastern pond’s inscription has dried up,\nThe western steps’ stele remains unerected,\nThe furnishings of the inner and outer halls are unworthy—\nWhat is to be done?\nIt is like setting out on a thousand-*li* journey, only to turn back at the gate—\nThis is not the conduct of a true man.\nA true man acts with righteousness as his weight,\nTo see righteousness and not act is cowardice.\n\nOf old, the two sons of the Lord of Gudu stood alone in their conduct, heedless of praise or blame—\nWere they acting for gain?\nMy sense of righteousness arises from innate nature,\nAs distant from those who seek fame and profit as heaven is from earth.\nPeople far and wide have heard and know this—\nEven without consulting spirits, there is no doubt,\nSo why must I speak so earnestly?\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says:\n*Though alone in your chamber, be not ashamed before the rafters.*\nThat which moves the spirits must be fitting.\nWhen the halls are restored, the walls erected, and all things prepared,\nThen offer sacrifices and present them,\nAnd reflect upon them—\nReverence will arise naturally.\nOtherwise, if one’s demeanor is even momentarily irreverent,\nA careless heart will deceive the spirits.\nNot only the spirits, but people too.\nNot only deceiving others, but deceiving oneself—\nWhat grandeur or solemnity can there be?\n\nThose who later tend to the temple,\nWalking these halls and reading this record,\nWill surely ask:\nWho were the eight who restored the temple?\nWho first proposed it?\nWho joined in the planning?\nAt first so diligent, in the end so negligent—\nThey too are people; what was their intent?\n\nAll things under heaven begin well, but few endure to the end.\nTo excel in both beginning and end—\nThis is the fulfillment of the human way.",

      "translated_text": "Difficult indeed is this—it is why I hasten so earnestly, seeking to ensure a strong beginning and a successful end.\n\nTo your question, I say: today’s scholars cannot proceed without wealth. Heaven does not send rain, spirits do not deliver offerings, the practice of alms-seeking yields nothing, and those willing to give generously are rarely seen. What plan, then, can be devised?\n\nI counsel you thus: when the multitude acts in accord, it must always treat righteousness as its profit. If profit is not taken as righteousness, no one will truly value righteousness, and the endeavor will not endure. Remember well this word: *righteousness*.\n\nI imagine those who joined this work rising abruptly, leaning against the wall, and declaring: “How dare we not accept this?”\n\n**Record of Completion**\n\nAffairs under heaven are not difficult at the outset—only in their conclusion. As the *Book of Songs* says: “All things have a beginning, but few endure to the end.” The *Book of Changes* states: “The fox crossing the river wets its tail”—speaking of how easy the start is, and how hard the finish.\n\nThus the noble person reveres the beginning and is cautious of the end, maintaining consistency from start to finish. This is called great good fortune. But if one is diligent at first and negligent at last, willingly yielding to the pressure of petty men—such are the schemes of those who achieve nothing. What use are they?\n\nTake, for example, the construction of this temple. At the beginning, there were eight of us. By the end, only seven remained. Of these, only three devoted themselves wholeheartedly. From this, we see clearly: affairs under heaven are not difficult at the start—only in their completion. This is indeed true.\n\nYet though the difficulty of completion may neither add to nor diminish my own standing, discerning observers will perceive in others the lack of resolve to see things through. How, then, can one hope to cultivate this as a field of blessing and seek its benefits?\n\nNow, six or seven of us have gathered in the courtyard to perform the rites of completion. Our merit lies in the altars of the state. We carve our inscription into metal and stone, that for a thousand generations to come, none may dare to neglect or forget.\n\nAs for the offerings—fine livestock, fragrant wine—our rites exceed what is proper, verging on excess. This is truly a shame for me. As the *Rites* in the *Tan Gong* says: “In sacrifice, if reverence is lacking but ritual is abundant, it is better to have ritual lacking and reverence abundant.” Here, both ritual and reverence are fully present. Why, then, does this record of completion seem to reproach me for insufficiency?\n\nThe numinous power of the spirits is indeed potent—why, then, do they not bestow a little more of it upon people? Such words are narrow indeed.",

Heaven’s Dao and the numinous spirits bless the good. The mountains echo and the valleys respond, answering every sound—why, then, do brush and tongue labor so earnestly to speak for me?\n\nHave you not seen the portraits of meritorious ministers in the Lingyan Pavilion?

Now you seven, if you can hold fast to this resolve to the end, may one day rise to the halls of state and take the affairs of the nation as your own responsibility.

Later, Han Tuizhi, Liu Yuxi, and others—men renowned for their wisdom and insight, universally admired—also spoke of \"malaria ghosts.\" Some composed texts to drive them away, others wrote poems to dispel them. Only then did people begin to believe that autumn fevers and winter plagues were truly called \"ghosts.\"\n\nYet ghosts are formless and soundless—how could they sicken men? Moreover, man is the spirit of the myriad things. Heaven covers him, earth bears him, sun and moon illuminate him, wind and rain, frost and dew nurture him through the four seasons. Grain, millet, mulberry, and hemp clothe and feed him. I see how deeply the workings of creation attend to man. If the human Dao is not established, then what we call heaven and earth, sun and moon, wind and rain, frost and dew—I know not what they truly are, save that we name them so. Alas, they would be but lifeless clods!\n\nSince creation has brought forth man in this world, how could it permit such ghosts to afflict the people? It is not the ghost—nor is the ghost the sickness. Rather, it is intemperance in food and drink, indulgence in sensual pleasures, the scorching of the bowels by sweet, sour, bitter, and pungent flavors, the rotting of the stomach. Joy, anger, sorrow, and delight disorder the nature and dissolve the spirit. The body is not wood or stone; assailed by so much, how could it not fall ill?\n\nYet in ancient times, when men fell ill, they were treated with decoctions and acupuncture, and none failed to recover and live. Now, when men fall ill, neither decoctions nor acupuncture can reach them. Alas, truly are these ghosts obstinate and unyielding to transformation!\n\nI, by the mandate of the Supreme Emperor, guard this land and govern its people. If any bring poison and harm to my people, I shall consult the *Laws of the Mysterious Code of the Female Celestial* and decree that they be beheaded a thousand thousand times, their forms severed ten thousand ten thousand times, until all are reduced to hares scurrying into their burrows, with none left as fish slipping through the net. Only then may my people’s desires be fulfilled.\n\nNow, as the Lower Prime announces a general amnesty, I shall recite a verse by Master Du and proclaim it thus:\n\n*You, with skulls blood-smeared and grim,*\n*I seize and hurl back to Magistrate Cui!*\n*Ghost, if you have any power, flee—flee—flee!*\n*Linger but a moment, and the Heavenly Axe falls!*\n\nWritten on the *jiazi* day of the second lunar month in spring, the eighth year of the *Kaibao* reign of the Song (Year of *Yihai*), by the Old Man of Biefeng.\n\n---\n\n**Exorcism of the Drought Demon**\n\nYou, whose name is drought, are called *Chi*. I know your ancestor was the Flame Clan, who ruled the world by the virtue of fire and rendered great service to the people, earning the revered title of Flame Emperor. Your lineage was once illustrious, yet how degenerate you have become, so base and unworthy! Your form is hideous, your nature perverse. Even the poison of *Bifang* and the calamity of *Huilu* are not as severe as you.\n\nWhen the Xia sovereigns cast images upon their tripods, you were so terrified that you led your kind to flee to the lands of the tattooed and black-toothed peoples, where you have dwelled for many years. Once, you vied for dominance with the *Kuafu* clan, reversing the sun’s shadow to chase them between the valleys of *Cigu*, but parched and weary, you sought to drink the waters of *Mingbo* and the great marshes, only to fail. Thus, you stole life by surreptitiously drinking from the rivers of the human world, nearly draining the Luo and the Yellow in a single draught. This led to the *Song of Mulberry Grove* reaching the heavens, whereupon your crime was judged, and you were nearly exterminated.\n\nKing Xuan of Zhou and Duke Jing of Qi treated you with benevolence, sparing your punishment. Since then, your remnant seed has spread and multiplied to this day.\n\nI, by the mandate of the Supreme Emperor, guard this land and govern its people. The people toil year-round, for food is their heaven. The heart of Heaven cherishes my people—how could it not transform, how could it not send rain? Who is to blame if not you? The grain is about to ear, the millet to ripen—do you not consider this, yet bring such ruin upon them?\n\nThough you bear the form of man and the nature of things, examine your heart—can you truly bear this? The straw chariot is prepared, the provisions are ready. I pour you a cup of clear water and solemnly declare: The lands of the tattooed and black-toothed peoples, your ancient homeland, lie south of the sea. You may reach them by evening if you depart at dawn.\n\nNow I make this pact with you: By the end of this day, gather your companions, take your kin, ride the dust and spread the wind, and set forth at once. If you do not heed these words, proving yourself obstinate and insensate, I shall invoke the *Laws of the Mysterious Code of the Female Celestial*. Any who harm the people and creatures of the land—all shall say they deserve death, and they shall be killed. Heaven has its records and its net; punishment will reach you, and there shall be no regret.\n\nThus, this proclamation.",

As the *Rites* in the *Tan Gong* says: “In sacrifice, if reverence is lacking but ritual is abundant, it is better to have ritual lacking and reverence abundant.” Here, both ritual and reverence are fully present. Why, then, does this record of completion seem to reproach me for insufficiency?\n\nThe numinous power of the spirits is indeed potent—why, then, do they not bestow a little more of it upon people? Such words are narrow indeed.",

Thus, the harm wrought by toads is indeed true.\n\nOf the creatures born of water, there are three hundred and sixty kinds. Among them, the toad is the most despised in Heaven and Earth. Its form is grotesque, its limbs scrabbling in the sand. Its belly swells, its throat constricts. Its color blends with mud, its diet is filth and dung. It leaps upon well-rails, rests in crumbling cliffs. Its dwelling is foul, its appearance vile. Day and night, it croaks, enslaved to demons.\n\n\"Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me—what place has the toad?\" Yet some say: The toad’s essence is a demonic thing.

      "translated_text": "Now the people—what crime have they committed to suffer such afflictions? The malady begins at the tip of a hair, festers in the joints and bones. At first, it brings stupor and blockage, dizziness and confusion. As it advances, the body twists, the sinews weaken, the waist grows heavy, the head spins. Nasal mucus flows like rain, the throat swells with phlegm, spittle and vomit choke the chest. Within, parched; without, desiccated—thirst without thirst—until searing heat erupts. Folk remedies and coal fumes, the fires of disaster, leave scorched heads and blistered brows, as though seated in a pit of flames. Even were one to ride the giant spirit, seize the Dipper’s ladle, and scoop the waters of the Bohai Sea to drench the flames, it would not suffice for relief. Some, born under the signs of *chen* and *xu*, sweat until the fever breaks. Others, once the heat subsides, are left with a dry cough that lingers for days, worsening without respite.\n\nI trace the source—whose fault is this? Is it not the autumn acting as summer, the imbalance of yin and yang? Or the five flavors indulged without restraint, the excesses of food and drink? Or the eyes fixed on dark and bright, the ears enslaved to lewd songs, the unchecked pursuit of sound and sensuality? What physician cannot cure it with medicine? What moxibustionist cannot apply the mugwort stove? The curses of the exorcist crackle like thunder, the talismans of the talisman-master slash like blades—yet the heart labors in vain, the eyes grow weary, and all efforts yield no result, their effects delayed. The people’s grievances converge upon one culprit: the toad.\n\nI, entrusted by the Supreme Emperor to govern this land and care for its people, find the toad still defiantly alive. It fills ditches as ghosts, becomes a demon-chief, a *chimei*, a *wangliang*, lurking in the dark, crouching in shadows. Treacherous and perverse, it stirs cruelty and oppression, devoid of mercy. The shadow-shooting of the short fox, the venom of the grass-biting centipede—none compare to the harm you wreak. Your crimes tower to the heavens; the people all cry for your death.\n\nNow I make this pact with the toads: Gather your kind within a single day and relocate together to the east of Lake Wanshan, where you may eke out a living, a borrowed existence—so long as you no longer harm my people. If not—if you remain stubborn and senseless, heedless of this warning—I shall commission the *Guo* clan to burn your dens and drown you in ash-laced wine. Then I will sever your heads, split your bellies, mince your flesh, and share it with the people to feast upon. Your kind must be eradicated to satisfy the people’s desires.\n\nHearing these words, the toads trembled in fear. Donning green robes, they knelt in the courtyard, begging for their lives: \"The willow-wheeled carts are ready, the red grass packed. We willingly submit and depart today. Spare us, O King, and pardon our crimes.\"\n\nThereupon, I composed this decree to hasten their departure:\n\n*\"Clear and upright, I embody the divine.\nBy Heaven’s mandate, I cherish the people below.\nO wretched toads, creatures of malevolence,\nRejoicing in calamity, why so cruel?\nDefying Heaven’s decree, you disrupt the seasons.\nThe people’s qi stagnates, their paths grow treacherous.\nEven Lu and Bian despair, their skills in vain.\nThe shamans chant and chew, their arts shrouded in darkness.\nWhat crime have the people committed to endure such suffering?\nO wretched toads, your sins overflow.\nThe people’s wrath gathers—your name is cursed.\nThey long to gnaw your bones, to mince your flesh.\nMy fury blazes like thunder and lightning.\nI entrust the Guo clan to execute justice.\nKneeling in the courtyard, you plead for mercy—\nA single cry for life, a reprieve from ten thousand deaths.\nO wretched toads, if you truly possess spirit,\nHear my words and reform.\nThe towering peaks of Wanshan, the limpid waters of the lake—\nThere lies your refuge, your haven of peace.\nGo deep, hide far, vanish from sight.\nDepart swiftly, swiftly—hasten as the law commands!\"*\n\nComposed in the third month of the *dingwei* day, spring of the eighth year of *Kaibao* in the Song dynasty (975).\n\n---\n\n**Ode on the Exorcism of Toads**\n\nThe people of Yue revere omens and believe in slaughter—an ancient custom, unshaken even now. When illness strikes, they grieve and fret. Yet the shamans and mediums warn: \"Without *ginseng* and *poria*, the cure demands blood.\" Some slander and deceive, currying favor with the crowd. Thus, I compose this *Ode on the Exorcism of Toads* to justify my actions. Its words read:\n\n*\"Alas, the world turned upside down—\nThe square wears the cap of the round.\nYin congeals into sores, the springs surge and flow.\nNightly, the blood-dripping specter roams the perilous forests.\nThe archer-demon lurks, listening for shadows to strike.\nHow can the pebble of Yan be mistaken for pearls?\nThe quack’s concoctions muddle yellow millet—who can tell true from false?\nThey accept tiles as gold, their thunderous clamor drowning the music of the *Xianchi* Pool.\nThey praise the beauty of the *Mo* mother, while the idle *Zou* son grows profligate and shameless.\nA wild bird enters the house—what omen does it bring?\nThe people lament and mourn.\nThe world craves the dregs of wine and pickled fare,\nYet I would feast on chrysanthemums and weave orchids.\nThe customs of the age oppress—\nMoths drawn to the flame, ants to the lamp.\nThe six excesses arise from imbalance—\nWhy blame frost and dew?\nThe cases of Shen and Tai Luo prove it—\nAre these not strange and unnatural?\nThey brandish spears and arrows like divining stalks,\nTheir words filthy, their claims absurd.\nThe dragon-horse reveals its form—\nLater, Fu Xi deciphered its celestial patterns.\nTo kill in pursuit of life—\nEven the southern wind cannot reverse it.\nThe bandits rage, drunk with power—\nThey deem all wood sacred.\nThe *Kui* burns for its recklessness—\nThe land suffers ever-greater drought.\nBetter to swallow charcoal and wail,\nOr face the wall and meditate.\nWhat crime have the fish and *zong* committed that the skies darken,\nTheir qi tangled in resentment?\nThey borrow the *Huiping* from the postmaster,\nBewildered by the snake in the cup.\nThey usurp creation’s harmony, tuning the pipes,\nHoping to thaw the ice and revive spring.\nThe mother clings to her child as the greatest concern,\nYet they cling to darkness, lost in ignorance.\"*",

      "translated_text": "**Preface on Friendship**\n\nThose who share the same path are called *peng* (companions); those who share the same aspirations are called *you* (friends). The meaning of friendship lies in neither flattery nor deceit, neither extravagance nor indulgence. It must first be realized in the heart before it can be called true kinship. If companionship exists without sincerity, it is mere superficial association. If friendship exists without sincerity, it is but a face-value friendship. The noble person does not partake in such.\n\nNow, you have sought from me inscriptions for paintings, and I have named them after the *Five Friends*: Friend Pine, Friend Bamboo, Friend Plum—these are the *Three Friends of Winter*. Friend Orchid—this is what Confucius meant when he said, \"Dwelling with a good person is like entering a room of orchids and iris; over time, one no longer detects the fragrance, for one has become one with it.\" Friend Chrysanthemum—truly, does not the chrysanthemum embody the Dao of the noble person with its noble fragrance? The meaning of these *Five Friends*—can it not be trusted?\n\nIn painting, nothing is more difficult than capturing the true likeness. Yet capturing the likeness is not the greatest challenge—capturing the form is harder still. But even capturing the form is not the hardest—capturing the heart is. Human hearts differ as widely as their faces. The noble and the petty may appear similar in countenance, but their hearts are not the same. If one abandons the heart and seeks only the outward form, one reduces the noble to the petty. Though this painting exists, who does not possess such a painting? Now that you have named these *Five Friends*, you must take the heart as your enduring companion. Thus it is said: *To judge by form is not as good as to judge by heart.*\n\n---\n\n**A Record of the Painter**\n\nI once read Liu Zihou’s *Biography of the Carpenter* and Han Tuizhi’s *Biography of the Decayed Wang Chengfu*, and was deeply moved. The purpose of a biography is to transmit a name. Reflecting on those times, carpenters and decayed men were as common as flowing water—why were only Yang Qian and Wang Chengfu remembered? As the Grand Historian once told Ren An: \"In ancient times, those who were wealthy and noble yet whose names were erased are beyond counting.\" These two men gained their fame through the biographies written by those two masters—how fortunate they were!\n\nNow, there is a man who makes himself known through painting. I fear his name may not be transmitted to posterity, so I dare to follow the example of the ancients and compose this record for him:\n\nIn Jishan Village of Min, there has stood the Temple of the Divine Aid King for many years. Its painted decorations had long faded into obscurity, its walls crumbling, nearly becoming a den for spring worms and autumn snakes. In the *guisi* year of the Zhiyuan era, the villagers restored it, wishing to repaint and renew it. Soon, those who licked brushes and ground ink arrived in droves, but no decision was made on whom to employ. They consulted me, but I refused their request. The villagers were astonished, finding it strange—was there some master who had stripped off his robes and sat cross-legged, yet had not yet arrived?\n\nOne day, a painter suddenly appeared, moved by a dream. Only then did they believe my words were true. Observing the man, he was steadfast and upright, refined and untrammeled by俗, dressed in the robes of a scholar. He did not speak his name, nor did anyone know his origins. That day, when gentlemen gathered to discuss integrity, he sighed and said: \"The greedy follow profit, the heroic follow fame. I have come for fame, not for profit. My name has long been known in other lands, but this region has not yet heard of it. Let me try—if I succeed, so be it.\" The temple’s protective walls bore old, incomplete paintings, so he was ordered to complete them with his brush. He rose eagerly, though a trace of reluctance remained—his skill had yet to be proven. The onlookers clapped their hands and laughed, saying: \"He has a hollow reputation! This is nothing but copying gourds or tracing horses from diagrams—what is there to praise?\"\n\nI then assigned him to paint the eastern and western galleries and admonished him: \"Painting has six principles: first, *qi* and movement that bring life; second, bone and strength in brushwork; third, responding to things and capturing their forms; fourth, applying colors according to their kind; fifth, planning and positioning; sixth, transmission and copying. In your painting, you must consider these six principles and seek beyond mere form. Perhaps then you will succeed.\"\n\nThe painter replied: \"Understood.\"\n\nThereupon, he ground cinnabar, sipped white pigment, diluted ink, and thickened smoke. Grasping his brush, he studied intently, and after several days, completed the work. He painted armored warriors, one hundred and twenty-eight in total: two commanding generals, two seal-bearers, two standard-holders, four axe-wielders, two charioteers, two umbrella-bearers, two hat-attendants, two executioners, four messengers and order-givers, two interpreters, four gong-and-drum strikers, two cymbal players, two advancing with Han Xin sabers, eight standing at attention with slashing sabers, twenty-six with spears at hand and swords at waist, four vanguard formation-arrangers, two name-flag bearers, four signal-flag bearers, two merit-flag bearers, sixteen bearing the Eight Trigrams and Eight Arrays flags, two falconers, eight tribute-bearers from the southern lands, and the rest wielding bows, arrows, halberds, spears, and polearms, all in service. Their appearances were imposing, their ranks disciplined, their momentum continuous, their movements coordinated from head to tail. Orderly and systematic, precise and reasoned—truly, they embodied the strategies of the *Six Secret Teachings* of the Grand Duke and the military methods of Sun Wu.\n\nAdditionally, there were two retinues of attendants, forty-eight in all, their waists adorned with gold and purple, dutifully carrying out their tasks. They led and followed, flanked left and right, their artistry so exquisite it seemed as though real people were present. All who saw it marveled, saying: \"Your painting is indeed masterful! Why was it so crude before, yet so refined now? Why was it so inferior before, yet so excellent now?\" As the ancients said: *\"Great skill appears clumsy; great wisdom appears foolish.\"*",

      "translated_text": "That, indeed, is what it means.\n\nThe painter Ni Shou slowly replied: \"What your servants painted before was merely capturing appearances to complete forms, fulfilling their structures to serve their functions. Others may have intentions, but divining them is no easy task—heart and tongue contend. What is called 'clumsy' and 'foolish' is truly so.\n\nWhat your servants paint today arises from the heart, envisioned in the mind’s eye, spiritually grasped and intuitively understood, flowing with the moment as the brush is commanded, in harmony with nature. We do not know why it becomes refined or crude, nor why it becomes excellent or inferior. We simply exhaust our artistry in the doing, not employing any cunning or clever technique.\n\nThen, can the fame of your servant’s painting truly be discussed?\"\n\nWhen the painting was finished, he inscribed it on the wall: *\"Painted by so-and-so on such-and-such a day and month.\"* The inscription merely records the name.\n\nAlas! If he were like that, then he too would seek fame through painting in the world and for posterity.\n\nAh! When a man is born with a seven-foot frame, he is the most numinous being between heaven and earth. With mulberry bow and reed arrows, his aspirations extend to the four directions. He must establish himself, practice the Dao, and make his name known to later generations to honor his parents—only then is a man’s duty complete. Otherwise, he is as if gagged and silenced, stifled and confused, content to be a jar or urn, like a brewing insect, growing old and dying to rot with the grasses and trees. Compared to the painter, would he not feel shame?\n\nWho is this painter? Cai Mengchen of Yurong.\n\nWho wrote the biography of Cai Mengchen? The Xuanfeng Lingji King.\n\n---\n\n**Postscript to Zhou Zhuangweng’s Stele Inscription**\n\nWhat I have written before and after is merely for my own amusement—truly, like a wild dog eating celery, unaware of the sting in its mouth or the pain in its belly, how could it know the taste?\n\nYet I am unworthily honored by your lofty friendship and pure prose, flowing like the mighty Yellow River. Your praise of my virtue shines resplendently.\n\nAs for the numinosity of mountains and rivers and the flourishing of people, there must surely be those of extraordinary talent, Daoist arts, loyalty, and integrity born among them. Like you, who harbor ability and hold potential, long suppressed—if you could rouse yourself to stand out and respond to your circumstances, even slightly, it would be my deepest hope.\n\nWhat I call the *spiritual* is virtue rooted in intelligence and uprightness, aligned with the seasons in its timing and applied to the myriad things with appropriateness. It is not the kind of spirit that flatters or curries favor to bring fortune.\n\nOf the hundred things seen morning and night, no one pays them heed. But when something extraordinary is heard of, all gaze upon it and speak of it. What you have asked me to postscript is also in hope of such extraordinary work.\n\n*\"The song ends, no one is seen— / On the river, several green peaks remain.\"* Is this not a poem of the spiritual? I dare use it to express my gratitude.\n\n---\n\n**Postscript to Zhou Zhuangweng’s *Explanation of the Yi Diagrams***\n\n\"Lingji\" is merely a temple name—why is it called a *king*? Those who hear of it cannot avoid offending the brush of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.\n\nThough I dare not refuse the honor of writing a postscript to your *Explanation of the Diagrams*, the profound meanings of the *Yi* are most abstruse—how can they be fathomed with a bamboo tube or a gourd dipper?\n\nI wished to take up my brush but feared being laughed at by those who carry firewood. Thus, I have gathered the discussions of earlier scholars and, with effort, written this postscript. If I have not fully grasped your intent in the middle, I have trimmed it away—may you find it fortunate.\n\nThe study of the classics has long been unclear. Our dynasty venerates schools and cultivates talent, placing the illumination of the classics as the foremost duty. The authorities promote education and governance, and for each classic, an instructor is appointed to guide its study—such is the earnest and diligent intent of their instruction.\n\nOf all the classics, the *Yi* is the most profound and recondite, not easily understood in its entirety. Those who study Wang Bi’s *Yi* engage in lofty discourse on principle, but their flaw is reckless extravagance. Those who study Jing Fang’s *Yi* rigidly adhere to images and numbers, but their flaw is inflexibility. Gaining in one aspect means losing in another; in the end, both are lost.\n\nMaster Jianxin Zhou of Sanshan, known as Gongbi in his official travels, possesses the *Yi Shaozheng Transmission* handed down in his family. It harmonizes both principle and images, and its words are purely and correctly derived.\n\nThe *Yi* has sixty-four hexagrams, and each hexagram discusses its primary line. Each line has its image, for which a diagram is made. Each diagram has its principle, for which an explanation is given. The explanations grasp principle, the diagrams grasp images and numbers—unified in one thread, they proceed without contradiction.\n\nI say that Master Zhou’s study of the *Yi* is refined—how could this be achieved in a single morning or evening?\n\nThe son of a skilled archer learns to make baskets; the son of a skilled furrier learns to make fur garments. If the transmission is not correct, how could one create diagrams and explanations that fully grasp the essence of the *Yi*?\n\nOne day, a fellow student of Master Zhou—unknown to me—tucked the diagrams and explanations into his sleeve and sought my opinion. I am ignorant and unlearned; glancing at them, though not easily understood, I grasped a thing or two. It is like food: when it comes to rare delicacies from distant lands, who would not crave them?\n\nI wished to write a postscript for carving and printing, to spread its transmission and not betray Master Zhou’s learning. Yet I fear my name is obscure and unworthy of the task.\n\nMaster Zhou’s given name is Zhuangweng, his courtesy name Zhibo, and Jianxin is his sobriquet. Those with whom he associates are all distinguished individuals—they will surely write a postscript for him.",

man summons them himself,\nThe heart’s core is the foundation of blessing.\nAlas, the world’s people are foolish and deluded,\nWhy must great families erect fences between them?\nDo they not recall the ghosts of shared ancestry?\nHow much more so for those bound as branches intertwined.\nWhere now is the rise and fall of royal mausoleums?\nTo bury a mother and be called a filial son—how could one bear it?\nHave you not seen:\nThe imperial qi of Jinling once flourished,\nYet the Qin sought to suppress it.\nThe palace bore Wu Zetian,\nAnd Gaozong was not unaware.\nIf even the state fares thus,\nWhy doubt the ways of men?\nTo dig graves and burn corpses is no noble virtue—\nWhat you would not desire, do not impose on others.\nBoth families harbor hidden deeds,\nBut above, the gods cannot be deceived.\n\n**Answering Zhou Shiyu’s Questions on Affairs**\nSouth to Yue, north to the Hu,\nWest into Qin, east into Wu—\nAll are heroes, true men.\nSetting forth on winding roads,\nBow of fleabane in hand, mulberry arrows at the waist.\nThe flowers of Heyang bloom in splendor,\nLet me ride my donkey as I please.\nIn life, friendships know no age,\nBound by affection as thick as creeping grass.\nOnce there were Chen and Lei,\nNow there are Huang and Su.\nYour heart and mine align—\nWhy consult the shamans of Yue?\n\nNow the path is smooth and wide,\nA single meal of fine vegetables brings contentment.\nThe two words \"peace and safety\" gladden a family letter.\n\n**Answering Master Lü’s Questions on Horses and Rice**\nThe old man of Gechuan, Wang Fangping,\nPassed through Dongwu to visit Cai Jing.\nThe people saw no immortal’s form,\nOnly heard the sound of carriages and horses in the void.\nGolden platters and jade cups arrayed eight delicacies,\nAs the wine waned, cloud-borne sheng music played.\nIn an instant, riding the wind with jade pendants raised,\nTiger-drawn and dragon-borne chariots sped to the purple heavens.\nHe left me a scroll called *The Yellow Court*,\nCinnabar that was once rice transformed.\nFive colors dazzle the eye, radiant and bright,\nYet in the realm of immortals, sun and moon never tarry.\nThe sea’s waters shallowed, stirring dust,\nWhile the men of Baxian barked at the orange-dwellers.\nWhy do worldly folk vie in rivalry?\nShorn hair and yellowed foreheads—what are they for?\nHurriedly chasing wins and losses in reckless gambling.\nHave you not seen:\nIn the dark sea, dates grow large as melons,\nOn Ying Mountain, plums swell like jars.\nHow does the joy of the orange’s midst compare?\nFeast on dates and plums—\nThey can preserve long life.\n\n**Encouraging the Painter Cai**\nThey say the Cai family excels in painting,\nA tiger-headed general reborn.\nFine or coarse, good or ill—all have their standards,\nCapturing spirit and qi with truth.\nLast year on the Double Ninth, you came to visit,\nPainting elite soldiers and spirits in their forms.\nMighty warriors with great feathered arrows at their waists,\nTheir bristling hair and whiskers striking awe.\nTo east and west, the stars of fortune and eminence,\nEach stroke and dot brimming with vitality.\nThe court teems with scholars in crimson and purple—\nNow I believe the scholar’s cap does not deceive.\nAbove, you paint perfected beings attending the imperial palace,\nTheir light clinging to sun, moon, and stars.\nBelow, you spread rain and dispel thunder,\nPersonally bearing the emperor’s decree to bless the living.\nReturning to your grotto, you play immortal music,\nSleeves scented with the faint fragrance of the imperial censer.\nOn either side, jade balustrades emerge,\nSilver hooks hang high, crimson curtains drawn.\nThe *Liupo* melody dances with slender waists,\nA hundred amusements jest with wit and charm.\nOnly the bedchamber’s painting remains unfinished—\nI know your skilled hand values brush and silk.\nYou cannot leave, you cannot leave,\nPainters like you are rare indeed.\nYear after year, year after year,\nAll say a steadfast heart can pierce stone.\nWind and moon cost no coin,\nEvery sip and bite is predestined.\nYet they say only the Xu family’s son,\nUnaware that peach and cassia are immortals.\nLast year’s song left meaning unexpressed,\nNow I compose this ancient poem to urge the traveler.\n\n**Answering a Student’s Questions on Eye Ailments**\nThey say the five aggregates are all thieves—\nWho would claim Heaven is cautious with the whites of eyes?\nBetter to gouge and hang them at my gate,\nThan mimic the frown of one who boasts of purple stone.\nFu Sheng’s debt of books remains unpaid,\nYet even Zhu Xin and King Liu left Kong’s estate.\nRooted in sorrow for the Dao, not for poverty—\nWhy then do pearl-like tears fall from my lashes?\nA boat’s itch cannot be scratched,\nOf late, red and festering, dim and blurred.\nI shame myself for wit not what it was,\nMy spirit withered, sinking into delusion.\nBefore the lamp, flames flicker, halos bloom,\nHair sparse, yellow and green—where is the jade-like blue?",

of wealth and nobility, the scions of kings and lords,\nThey return from spring’s revels.\nVying in finery, silks and satins, pure and soft,\nNot to mention mounds of yellow gold.\nGold fills the hollow—\nFan Li of Tao was once Zhu of Yi, who changed his name and returned to his homeland.\nAt Qi’s gate, he played the zither, unrecognized in his time,\nLooking back, the minister’s seal was but a worn-out tray.\nA worn-out tray—\nHuman life is but a butterfly’s dream, fluttering and fleeting,\nI urge you: time is just this brief.\nBut preserve this square inch of ground,\nAnd entrust it to your descendants as their foundation.\nFive, six, seven—these numbers\nMark the finest prospects ahead.\n\n**To the One Commissioning an Inscription**\n\nThough the spirit is upright and not demonic,\nIn dark, desolate chambers, I sit ashamed of undeserved favor.\nThough true talent exists for great use,\nI, a rotten tree, am unworthy of carving.\nYet with bundles of silk and scallions, you show respect,\nAnd with a generous verse, you vie for the prize.\nA hundred generations will flourish—all thanks to ancestral virtue,\nIn time, the phoenix will surely sing in the court.\n\n**Thanking Magistrate Lin for Inscribing the Stele**\n\nOn the ancient plain, a ruined temple sighs over its mounds,\nIts lineage traced back to the Xu clan.\nHeroes grow old, as worthless as dust,\nWho now understands the classics and their profound meaning?\nThough I cannot match Han Yu’s records,\nI am glad to write like Liu Zongyuan.\nAshamed I lack five hundred taels of gold for the brush’s reward,\nYet the spirit, in hidden favor, knows me well.\n\n**Farewell to Painter Cai**\n\nA master’s brush brings forth art from nature,\nGu Kaizhi and Yan Liben inherited its transmission.\nThough the craftsman’s skill is prized, the brush may seem clumsy,\nThe pigments deep and rich, the colors all the more vivid.\nOn the wall, his name endures for ten thousand ages,\nAmong men, his fame spreads to three thousand guests.\nNow, as we part, I am filled with sorrow—\nA humble cup of wine, a poem to send him off.\n\n**Four Daoist Masters Manifest at the Altar’s Construction**\n\nFour immortals descend to the luminous altar,\nPity those who see with different eyes.\nClad in gourds, they laugh with open mouths,\nHolding bats, they step through wide-open gates.\nTheir cloud-like hearts lightly come and go,\nA thousand-year iron pillar stands, ancient and mottled.\nIf you ask where I dwell,\nI am beyond Penglai’s outer mountains.\n\n**To the Old Almsgatherer of the Heavenly King, Whose Request Went Unfulfilled**\n\nSuch contempt is but the work of power’s sway,\nThough the spirit descended, it curled up in reluctance.\nI know well the barriers between Qin and Yue,\nHow can there be the steadfast bond of Chen and Lei?\nEmpty formalities in four-six prose, sealing jars of sauce,\nRepeated auspicious divinations waste feasts and efforts.\nCease your weary thoughts of longing for me,\nGo instead to the mountains and drink from the stone spring.\n\n**Three Answers on Affairs**\n\nThose who beg for minor blessings exist,\nYet those who exert effort and offer wealth find no cause.\nEmperor Wu mocked those who gave themselves to the Buddha,\nDeceitful hearts still practice the ways of the Man and Min.\nDo not say planting blessings bears no seed—\nI fear this fleeting body will turn to dust.\nSwift as a galloping steed, human life passes in an instant,\nHow pitiable—Zhao Meng, ever earnest in his advice.\n\nIn stillness, I laugh at the world’s people,\nWho know not the causes of past and future lives.\nAll are but karmic shrines from the Jin of Shi,\nWho knew they once belonged to the kingdom of Min?\nWealth and nobility, ten thousand kinds, vanish like dreams,\nHow many heroes have already turned to dust?\nDiligently practice deeds of kindness,\nNo need for more earnest words.\n\nThe spirit’s manifest power lies in man,\nOr perhaps not—heaven has no cause.\nA single heroic soul swallows the cosmos,\nA thousand ancient temples adorn Min and Ou.\nThe western stele remains unerected, its record left empty,\nThe inner walls are still stained with dust.\nTo begin and complete is the work of a noble man,\nWhy need the transforming brush to urge you further?\n\n**Answering the Liang Clan’s Inquiry on Reburial**\n\nThe ox sleeps where Tao Gong divined the grave,\nA white crane immortal briefly descends to the mortal realm.\nThe heart’s sincerity matches the yin earth’s goodness,\nHow dare I claim heaven’s favor is mine alone?\nIf indeed the ancestors’ spirits are present,\nThey will see your descendants rise to high office.\nOffer a peach in return for jade,\nAll comes from the Creator, who knows repayment.\n\n**To Judge of the Shanglin Prefecture, in the Style of Cao E**\n\nWithout your command, the characters were not complete,\nYet in my sleeve, I knew them from crossing great rivers.\nVillage songs and roadside chants linger like swift horses,\nThe two sweet pear trees recall the renowned worthy.\nTen marvels of the precious hall—\n\n**Golden Turtle Peak**\nOnce it bore the square Penglai from the sea,\nHere it coils, never to return.\nA thousand years have divined its divine splendor,\nAshamed I lack the eight-pillar talent to hold up the sky.\n\n**Literary Brush Peak**\nIts solitary crest soars into the vast, empty void,\nIts distant form seems to pierce the heavens like a bookshelf.\nThis land has long produced officials and scholars,\nThe earth’s vital qi breeds literary heroes.\n\n**Greedy Wolf Peak**\nAmong the seven stars of the Dipper, it shines with literary brilliance,\nHow did this mountain rise so tall from the earth?\nI long to soar to its highest summit,\nTo forever join the earth’s tongue in aiding peace.\n\n**Lotus Peak**\nJade-like flowers display their artistry, distant and graceful,\nThe Buddha’s hair emits a subtle fragrance, drifting into the mysterious.\nIf only a heavenly wind could carry a single leaf,\nIt too would drift eastward with Taiyi.\n\n**Square Rock Peak**\nA stone fan opens into the empty sky,\nIts scenery surpasses Penglai.\nAt times, when the azure heavens descend to pay homage,\nThe wind’s axle briefly rests on green moss.\n\n**White Deer Peak**\nHow many years have passed since the white deer came?\nThe perilous peak still leans against the blue sky.\nIn leisure, not only do I discuss true secrets,\nI also seek a forest monk to ask about Chan.\n\n**Ancient City Peak**\nLayered summits, emerald hues shrouded in verdure,\nThe ancient ramparts have no foundation, yet the gaze never ends.\nAt midnight, under the bright moon, the heavens’ music resounds,\nI suspect a crane has returned from the distant east.\n\n**Flying Tumbleweed Peak**\nA tumbleweed flies from the sea,\nCinnabar cliffs and emerald walls stand tall in the distance.\nWhere now is the immortal who played the sheng?\nOnly peach trees, a thousand in bloom, remain.\n\n**Purple Terrace Peak**\nThe terrace peak juts out east of the Yue River,\nA winding path of black and purple threads through the verdant hues.\nHow many times has the bright moon seen immortals descend?\nTheir coral pendants tinkle in the celestial wind.\n\n**Great Peace Peak**\nThe benevolent winds of a bright age spread great peace,\nHow fortunate this mountain is to bear such a fine name.\nSeveral times I have climbed to its summit to gaze,\nThe six directions stretch boundlessly, heaven and earth clear.\n\n**Eight Poems on True Immortals**\n\n**Palace of the Turtle Peak Immortal**\nFrom the sea, the peak surges forth like a golden turtle,\nA dark palace stands, firmly constructed.",

peach blossoms bloom.\nA single loyalty upholds the realm,\nA crimson edict bestows honor and praise.\n\n**Dragon Pool Flying Waterfall**\nA thousand-foot dragon’s maw—no ladder may scale,\nA flying torrent plunges straight down in rainbow spray.\nThe immortals, late returning from gathering essences,\nIdly play with murmuring streams and medicinal mud.\n\n**Bamboo Cliff After Snow**\nThe sacred cliff retains its auspicious snow,\nDawn’s light now brightens the clearing sky.\nPiled whiteness cradles the first rays,\nFrozen splendor gleams in the Great Clarity.\nLow, it buries the bent bamboo;\nHigh, it crushes the ancient pine.\nI long to soar to the perilous summit,\nStrolling at leisure in a crane-feather cloak.\n\n**Immortal Isle’s Sacred Fungus**\nDazzling, resplendent—threefold blossoms flourish,\nThe harmonious qi of the Great Peace nurtures this spiritual root.\nDwelling hidden here, how to repay its grace?\nPlucked and offered to Yu Yan, presented to the Supreme Lord.\n\n**Returning Tide at Green Bank**\nAt the farthest bank, the cold tide recedes,\nWinding and distant, the view stretches wide.\nGrass roots cling to scattered stones,\nThe river’s mouth reveals level sands.\nBirds peck at the broken green mud,\nBoats moor to ancient, slanting willows.\nIn but a moment, the tide returns again—\nFrom here, I set sail on a transcendent raft.\n\n**Travelers at South Pond**\nWheels and hooves rush to and fro,\nThe road links north and south, passing through Min’s mountains.\nPity the restless souls in the red dust—\nHow can they compare to the immortal palace’s leisurely days and months?\n\n**Wood Ridge’s Woodcutter’s Song**\nThe woodcutter’s song echoes from Wood Ridge,\nThe rugged path darkens as the sun sinks.\nMelodious, it drifts across winding streams,\nGentle, it emerges from layered forests.\nLow, it mingles with the golden cicadas’ tune;\nHigh, it follows the white cranes’ cries.\nWithin the jade palace, no vulgar notes—\nHearing this, the heart’s cares dissolve.\n\n**Bell Mountain’s Pagoda**\nAs the sun rises, Bell Mountain’s air feels new,\nA seven-tiered pagoda surges in phosphorescent splendor.\nSince ancient times, this blessed land has borne the wise and noble—\nIn this sagely age, those inscribed are not few.\n\n**Two Poems for Xu Nancun**\nMud and wood assume forms—how laughable indeed,\nYet you patch rustic words into poetic lines.\nSir, you are no Master Pang,\nYet how does your lamp’s light pervade the great chiliocosm?\n\nAshamed I lack the skill to season the broth,\nI playfully blend all things into fragrant harmony.\nFeasting in the butcher’s hall, one knows many flavors—\nMock not the mountain dweller’s wild greens and amaranth.\n\n**Ten Marvelous Peaks of Jade Mountain**\n\n**Golden Immortal Peak**\nThe cinnabar turtle’s thousand-year embers have turned to ash,\nOnly its towering stone halls remain, jagged and grand.\nCasually ascend the summit to gaze afar—\nBeyond the clouds, the verdant Five Terraces rise.\n\n**Heavenly Pillar Peak**\nStep by step, nearing the mountain’s front,\nSuddenly, bell tones shatter the dawn mist.\nA peak abruptly rises, sheer as a wall—\nIts strength seems enough to prop up the sky.\n\n**Sunrise Peak**\nAt dawn, the stone cliff pierces the clouds,\nDripping spring sounds chill the night air.\nI thought only the gibbons’ cries marked the predawn,\nYet when I open the door, the sun has climbed three poles high.\n\n**Third Young Master’s Peak**\nBy the Fishing Creek, a fishing boat,\nI ask the passerby—do you know his surname?\nWith a smile, I point to this mountain’s refined charm:\nWildflowers, singing birds—enough for carefree wandering.\n\n**Golden Splendor Peak**\nFrom afar, it seems a painting, seizing heaven’s artistry,\nHazy mountain light reflects the evening glow.\nThe pines and firs atop the ridge hold ancient intent—\nWho knows that in the dead of night, the robe has already been passed?\n\n**Rising Cloud Peak**\nFor miles, the path winds around the mountain’s flank,\nDawn’s hues remain dim, the mist not yet dispersed.\nScratching my head in the blue haze, I lose the way—\nOnly the sound of a single thunderclap from the mountain’s base.\n\n**Treasure Terrace Peak**\nLayer upon layer, its form rivals Kunlun’s cliffs,\nThe gallery path seems celestial, beyond climbing.\nA single point of pure light ever shines before me—\nPine winds and cassia moons make a fine livelihood.\n\n**Great Seat Peak**\nAfter rain, the mountain mist dyes the peaks dark,\nThe stone path is slick, few travelers pass.\nThe meditator naturally grasps the dharma of meditation—\nFrom where does the cold bell toll at dawn?\n\n**Jade Angelica Peak**\nA single heavenly flower, still unopened,\nWho plucks it and does not offer it?\nStraight to the summit’s peak I sit,\nAt times, its fragrance wafts to Tiantai.\n\n**Twin Lads Peak**\nThe hanging terrace’s bright mirror turns with the clear light,\nThe Jade Maiden once tested the morning’s zither.\nEver like maidens in their youthful days,\nForever young, their hair never turns white.\n\n**East Stream**\nThe stream’s voice is just this—water murmuring,\nEver constricted, it flows away and does not return.\nCountless worldly affairs are all thus—\nHow can they compare to the white gulls’ leisure on the sand?\n\n**West Stream**\nIn the mountains, idle guests visit one another,\nI ask those coming from the west—their intent?\nNeither increasing nor decreasing, without hindrance,\nFollowing the current, they pass through the Heavenly River.\n\n**Jade Cliff**\nI love the mountain, thus I love the jagged stone,\nThe jade-grade mountain becomes a jade brother.\nTwin streams divide, sending white egrets forth,\nTen peaks encircle, half green and half withered.\nIn the mortar of light clouds, tea holds many flavors;\nBy the lamp of the waning moon, a volume of scripture.\nBy chance, I reach the upper hall to ask of Chan—\nSurely they know I am no ordinary man.\n\n**Two Poems Seeing Off Chen Daoxing to Dragon-Tiger Mountain**\nWithin Zhongnan Mountain lie many fine scenes,\nYet alas, the ambition for fame and rank still smolders.\nOn the Dragon-Tiger Board, a new name appears—\nPlum blossoms first claim the hundred flowers’ primacy.\n\nRecommending the true and evaluating the worthy—this is ancient numen,\nAiding others’ good deeds paves the way ahead.\nMagpies call to report news of peace—\nI compose these verses to send you on your journey.\n\n**Matching Monk Dejian of White Cloud**\nSpeak not of Qin, Sui, Jin, Han, or Tang—\nThe three gates, the thatched hut, the land of white clouds.\nThe water buffalo does not leave; the mountain’s old man is false—\nI ask you: in those years, did you burn incense?\n\n**Four Occasional Poems**\nWithin stillness, heaven and earth reckon not the spring,\nAffirming and negating—let the myriad things whirl.\nWhere now are Xing Yuan and Zui Bai?\nBeyond the clouds, green mountains—mountains beyond clouds.\n\nI once heard the song of the captured unicorn,\nOnly to learn that Master Gao was a fine man.\nThe lotus flower, about to speak, holds many sentiments—\nHow can it compare to the speechless flower’s sunlit spring?\n\nWhere to seek the bright moon and clear wind?\nPoets’ bitter thoughts dissolve in wine.\nForgetting schemes, unconcerned if others understand,\nThe sand gulls alone know this heart.\n\nTwo autumns have passed since I forgot you,\nThis feeling remains unspoken—do you know it?\nBeyond the green mountain gate, many sentiments linger,\nLeft for poets to take as their topic.\n\n*End of Xu Xian’s Literary Works, Scroll Seven*\n*Beginning of Xu Xian’s Literary Works, Scroll Eight*",

      "translated_text": "**Petition for the Appointment of Xuanbiao Zhenjun**\n\nWe humbly submit: though the Gate of Heaven stands but a footstep away, none have prostrated in loyal remonstrance. The sacred precincts are stern and bright—how dare we presume to petition before the celestial throne? Overwhelmed and trembling, we can neither advance nor retreat.\n\nYour servant [Name] respectfully reflects: the Primordial Master, the Heavenly Master, holds the sacred rank, his Dao transmitted from the Prior Heaven, his teachings proclaimed through a hundred generations as the covenant of truth, an eternal transmission for the unlearned. We, your servant, though charged with ritual duties and bound by precepts, dare not act alone in private schemes without first submitting this plea. There are established precedents—we must await the guidance of left and right hands, never straying from the law. The ranks of East and West must stand as one, each in their proper place. On an auspicious day, we shall perform the Luotian Jiao rites to express our gratitude to Lingji Zhenren. Yet we fear that fellow altar practitioners may not yet heed the wondrous teachings, and though we strive together in the Dao, we dare not prolong this petition further. The statutes prescribe penalties for transgressions—we tremble lest we violate their severity.\n\n**Petition of Gratitude for the Appointment of Xuanbiao Zhenjun**\n\nWe, in awe and trepidation, bow our heads again and again. We reverently consider the Marshal, the Great Dharma Master, whose merit pervades transformation and nurture, whose Dao penetrates the profound and subtle. As rivers and marshes flow boundlessly, all return to the sea in homage. Yet before the radiance of sun and moon, who would dare cover their eyes? We gaze toward Heaven to repay its grace, yet our devotion remains imperfect, our efforts exhausted. Our transgressions pile like mountains, our merits weigh no more than dust. Yet by your gracious indulgence, you heed our words without rejection.\n\nWe, your servant, though dwelling in the Cavern of Truth, remain unenlightened, aged and incapable. Yet through the intercession of memorials, we are deemed worthy. How could we presume to advance in the immortal ranks, coveting merit or usurping rank? Now, as Xu [Name] and others are elevated in rank and bestowed imperial favor, we, who partake of the land’s bounty, share in the gratitude for life’s blessings. With hands raised and feet dancing, we unite in reverent joy. To speak further would be presumptuous—we fear only transgression.\n\n**Petition of Gratitude for the Bestowal of Rank**\n\nThe rites for warding off calamity and averting disaster are solemnly observed. Those who build merit and accumulate virtue deserve advancement in the immortal ranks. Though the divine cannot be measured, our thoughts and words must be laid before them.\n\nWe, in awe and trepidation, bow our heads again and again. We recall the Yellow Emperor, who sought the essence of the supreme Dao from Guangchengzi, and the Magistrate of Sangkan, who followed Lord Lao to fathom the mysteries of the profound and dark. Vast and boundless, the Dao eludes all grasp—expansive as a valley, it embraces the ten thousand things. Broad and ever-flowing, it transcends the small and incomplete. It does not abandon simplicity, and in its vastness, all things find completion. To align with the times is the mechanism of rising above the mundane and entering sainthood; to hold fast to the center and embrace the One is the essence of learning.\n\nThe Primordial Yang Jade Calendar must be entrusted to the right person. The precious scriptures of the Most High condense the qi of spontaneity. When mortals recite them, their lives are prolonged; when spirits hear them, they ascend as immortals. Each bears the karmic causes of past lives, and thus their merits defy all reckoning.\n\nWe, your servant, though longing for the Dao, lack the talent of the worthy. We have not mastered the method of extracting lead and merging mercury in the golden elixir, yet we dare to undertake the duty of submitting sealed memorials. We reflect further on the Jiao leaders, who, sheltered by the divine, dwell in peace within their villages, honored at the shrine of Lingji. Endowed with wisdom and virtue, they bring timely sunshine and timely rain, fulfilling the auguries of tortoise and milfoil. Their merit serves the state, their blessings nourish the people—we recall the enduring joy inscribed on their monuments. Though millet and sorghum lack fragrance, we offer them in sacrifice. On the mornings of the Three Origins when blessings converge, we observe a day of fasting and abstinence. By the grace of the Heavenly Master above and the imperial favor below, we are adorned with honorific titles, our names resplendent. Such glory is unheard of in antiquity and unmatched in the present age.\n\nThis is all due to the august presence of the Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven. The vault of Heaven arches above, the Emperor governs all—beneath his encompassing gaze, his benevolence has long been celebrated. We, your servant, are but lowly as ants and lice, foolish and dull. Only when we behold the celestial majesty of dragon and phoenix do we dare to speak. Though the divine may rely on talent, how could we idly occupy our positions? We must not fabricate affairs to seek merit. We have received more than our due—our gratitude is boundless. Yet we remain as one who clings to a tattered robe, ever mindful of treading on thin ice.\n\nWe humbly pray that your majesty’s virtue may endure for a hundred generations, that your blessings may descend in abundance, and that the imperial mandate may bestow prosperity upon all people. We, your servant, dare not cease in our reverence and awe. With this memorial, we respectfully express our gratitude.\n\n**Memorial of Gratitude for the Bestowal of Rank at the Golden Palace**\n\nYour servant [Name] humbly received the imperial decree on the first day of the third month, appointing me as the Nine Heavens Golden Palace Illuminated Dao and Virtuous Great Immortal, Manifest Spirit, and Universal Savior Zhenren, charged with overseeing the Upper Clarity Heavenly Texts Academy and all matters therein. Gazing toward the Golden Palace, we receive the imperial mandate—our new title inscribed upon the cinnabar terrace, our place secured among the immortal ranks. The radiance of this favor is profound, our awe and trepidation all the greater.\n\nWe, in awe and trepidation, bow our heads again and again. We reverently consider the Supreme Jade Clarity Palace, where all is carefree and joyous. Beyond lies the Mysterious True Realm, luminous and resplendent. Its symbols shine like the double halos of sun and moon, its auspicious signs weave through the five-colored mists. The myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms gather in attendance. Dragons and tigers array to the left and right, phoenixes and simurghs sing before and behind. This is the celestial realm’s delight—how could one of lowly station ever hear of it?\n\nThrough the revolutions of kalpas and the turning of the wheel, we awaken to the necessity of cultivating fasting and practicing the Dao, aspiring to attain sagehood and achieve perfection. We reflect that spirits are vast and unfathomable, while we dwell in the turbid world, rushing about. Sacrificing animals in worship, we know only the schemes of flesh-eaters.",

      "translated_text": "The millet and sorghum are not fragrant; I humbly accept my place among those who partake of plain meals, clinging only to grass and trees. I have achieved no merit near or far, yet mistakenly received undeserved favor out of turn, belonging still to the ranks of witless spirits. From the Purple Tenuity Palace, the imperial edict is proclaimed; the Emperor’s Seat descends to the palace balcony. Its light approaches the Seven Stars, illuminating all within nine thousand li. My rank equals that of the constellations—numbering one hundred eighteen in all—overseeing the distribution of emoluments at the Three Terraces and assisting the Literary Prosperity in the Six Ministries. When virtue gathers, worthy men rejoice in assembly; when the Dipper overturns, the year’s grains yield abundance. The Old Man appears at the center of the Southern Culmen, below harmonizing with the Auspicious Staircase’s sign—all by the Emperor’s power, what merit is mine?\n\nThis is only because I have encountered the August Heavenly Jade Emperor beneath the Jade Steps. His great virtue is called \"life,\" lofty and supreme; though without sound or scent, he is indeed possessed of form and image. With drums and banners, he once vowed to deliver humanity; holding the tally and wielding the calendar, he alone opened the origin of embodying the Dao. The cinnabar script revealed the essence of warmth and governance, while the green characters presented the auspicious omens of the Milky Way. Thunder issues decrees, the celestial river becomes his decree. Majestic is his descending might; he entrusts me with the selection of the Cultured Right. I, your servant, ascend the hall with sword and shoes, rejoicing in the worthy’s attainment, as the gowned and hatted come to court. I emulate the feudal lords’ offering of jade, deeply favored by grace, diligent in my duties.\n\nI cannot contain my awe as I gaze upon the heavens and long for the sagely presence, overwhelmed with reverence. Humbly I present this memorial in gratitude.\n\n**Memorial of Thanks for Accepting Office at the Jade Tower**\n\nI, your servant, respectfully received on the first day of the third month the decree appointing me as the Nine Heavens Jade Tower Proclaiming Transformation and Upholding the Dao Supreme Immortal, Illustrious and Vastly Beneficent Perfected One, to govern all courts of the Lower Realm’s Earthly Prison and act with full authority. I prostrate myself before the solemn Jade Tower, bowing near the celestial steps; the golden script bestows honor, specially ennobling my appointment in the Earthly Prison. Overwhelmed by this private favor, I know not how to respond. Reverently I take my place, traversing countless millions of li. Uniting the Four Seas in shared custom, the twenty-eight lunar lodges encircle the heavens; corresponding to the Nine Provinces’ divisions, the three thousand worlds and all sentient beings are subject to the illumination of stars, sun, and moon. Whether forests, trees, mountains, or rivers—high or low—all are human: truly, how joyous!\n\nI pray to open the purple sunlit cloud-brocade satchel and attain deliverance within the Jade Chamber’s cinnabar terrace. Though the Most High does not lightly bestow, I am fortunate that this humble servant may partake in hearing it. Day and night I press on, my spirit ever facing the divine. Reflecting, I am no ghost concealing myself but rely on others to act upon my thoughts. Though I wish to fulfill the heart of fasting and serving the Emperor, I remain subject to the reproach of gluttony and worthlessness. My fields are barren stone, my worldly ties unsevered. Mistakenly I have received the honor of imperial edicts and elegant decrees, specially entrusted with the people’s welfare. I exhort goodness and punish evil, penalize transgressions and reward merit. The virtuous have their names recorded in the Southern Palace; the guilty have their souls confined in the Northern Bureau. I oversee the immortal registers of the Three Isles’ sacred mountains and govern the true administrations of the Five Peaks and Four Continents.\n\nReverently I receive this solemn charge, trembling with awe. The flying squirrel must measure its strength; even the great turtle cannot bear such grace. This is only because I have encountered the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven. The myriad forms flow into being, his favor reaches the utmost. He commands the transformations of yin’s gloom and yang’s ease, the powers of spring’s birth and autumn’s harvest. The Emperor’s chariot soars, the stars array in guard. The Dark Capital stretches boundlessly, adorned with the seven treasures. Auspiciousness unfolds in the azure vault’s hymns; I look up to praise the Jade Emperor’s august title. Repeatedly I have received his gracious commands, surpassing my peers. Ashamed of my lack of merit, I have been elevated—my body cleansed, my sincerity already expressed in offerings of pondweed and water plants. In divining harvests and praying for the year, there is the joy of millet, sorghum, rice, and grains. Below, I fulfill the people’s wishes; above, I answer the heavens’ intent.\n\nI cannot contain my gratitude for this grace, overwhelmed with reverence. Humbly I present this memorial in gratitude, performing the rites with reverent words.\n\n**Memorial to the Heavenly Master**\n\nIt seems your virtue has long sheltered the southern Min, while I gaze toward the northern palace, once more beholding the sun and moon’s light. The imperial decree’s favor descends, and I blush in self-reproach. I am truly fearful and awestruck, bowing my head again and again.\n\nI have heard that Mount Ci once manifested its form at the river’s edge, receiving the great emperor’s enfeoffment in the catalpa shrine. Reverently it descended its brush upon Min and E, extravagantly celebrating the Primordial Emperor’s praise. Through filial piety and sincerity, heroic deeds attain the Dao; through woodcutting and smelting, compassionate aid achieves success. If not for vowing to deliver humanity, how could one transcend the mundane and enter sageliness? Such things exist—how could they be mere chance?\n\nTurning to my own conduct, only the Dao is great. Since the Great Ultimate’s division, there have been the people and the altars of state. By the end of the five kalpas, who shall uphold the guiding principles? This is only because I have encountered the Orthodox Unity, Tranquil Response, Divine Transformation, Manifest Assistance Perfected Lord. When the heart can respond with tranquility and attain the Dao, silently merging with the divine and transforming, it is effortless non-action; when manifesting assistance, it is as if abundantly present. His aspiration is to aid the state and pacify the people; his heart is to establish teachings and set forth regulations. Purple characters and golden names mark the registers of medicinal pearls; jade seals and vermilion tallies translate the phoenix-script texts. The Dao’s law precedes heaven, its learning transmitted to later ages. The hundred spirits guard it; the myriad things revere it. The Great Mystery’s fifteen govern the world from Ghost Valley; the Supreme Yang’s First Administration corresponds to the Horn Star. His numinosity shines through antiquity, his deeds recorded in historical transmissions—beyond the contemplation of one such as I. This is why the Master’s Dao is uniquely revered.\n\nReflecting, I, your servant, rely on others to act, clinging only to the divine. I am akin to rotting grass, a decaying tree without pattern. My stele inscriptions are doubly shamed by Lord Liu; my posthumous name barely survives in Jin history. I cannot distinguish medicine from stone, much less know of Ma Fu or Niu Sou; my furnace and tripod are incomplete—how could I recognize dragon lead or tiger mercury? Though I possess the will to save things, I initially lack the talent to order the world. In divining like Junping and practicing auspicious arts, I merely instruct in loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness, following the teachings of Confucius.",
      "overlap_context": " phoenixes and simurghs sing before and behind. This is the celestial realm’s delight—how could one of lowly station ever hear of it?\n\nThrough the revolutions of kalpas and the turning of the wheel, we awaken to the necessity of cultivating fasting and practicing the Dao, aspiring to attain sagehood and achieve perfection. We reflect that spirits are vast and unfathomable, while we dwell in the turbid world, rushing about. Sacrificing animals in worship, we know only the schemes of flesh-eaters.",

Unaware of what I emulate, I have long called such reckless acts a sin from which no earth affords escape.

To gain it truly startles me. Adrift on the sea of the great leviathan, my spirit flees and my soul trembles; bearing the mountain of the giant turtle, my virtue swells with profound favor.

Upholding the rites of repentance and admonition, I know my own recklessness and fail to grasp the essence of scriptural teachings—yet I still hope for enlightenment. All this stems from my master’s transmission; how dare I claim it as my own achievement? I revere the sagely transformation and proclaim the winds of benevolence. Above, I pray for the sovereign’s longevity, echoing the triple invocation of Mount Song; below, I ensure my people receive the blessings of the *Ji Chou*, as the talismanic transmissions foretell. May sons beget grandsons, and grandsons beget sons in unbroken succession. Though the rites of pepper and orchid may lapse, only the Dao resides in the heart, and the heart is the Dao.

      "translated_text": "**Memorial of Congratulation to the Sacred Father, Prince Qi, the Loyal and Martial Perfected One**\n\nWith reverence, we reflect upon Your Highness, the Sacred Father, Prince Qi, the Loyal and Martial Perfected One: repaying the state with loyalty, establishing merit through martial prowess. Selecting households for enfeoffment, you have long received the favor of the jade tablet’s grace. Issuing royal decrees, you once unsealed the golden casket’s writ. Your might shook the Huai and Yangtze, your blessings descended upon the garrisoned commanderies. Yesterday, the offering of winter-blooming camellia brought forth purple qi that filled the court; today, the auspicious omen of the blue arrow’s light illumined the chamber. We, your humble servants, though unworthy to stand in your shadow, have yet to fully bask in your boundless grace. Gazing toward the northern palace, we pour forth our devotion; pointing to the southern mountains, we pray for your longevity. We further hope that in the hall’s joyous feasting, all may nurture hearts of familial harmony; that within the four borders, peace may reign, and everywhere, the divine hemp’s shelter be enjoyed. We present this memorial in congratulation.\n\nMoreover, as the new year begins in harmony, its auspiciousness is confirmed by the dawning day. The Nine Heavens resound with celebration, and all rejoice together in the praise of the divine. Auspicious qi drifts like clouds, while joyful voices thunder like thunder. I, your servant, in awe and trepidation, bow my head again and again to offer congratulations.\n\nWith reverence, we reflect upon Your Highness, the Sacred Father, Prince Qi, the Loyal and Martial Perfected One: your nature is upright and just, your rule both martial and civil. Once, your name was heard beyond the Yangtze; now, your deeds flourish in the heart of Min. The four directions’ worthies gather like crowns and tiaras; the radiance of sun and moon is doubled. For a thousand ages, incense and lamps endure, as eternal as heaven and earth. We bow our heads in homage, emulating the reverence of Zhao Hu; we raise our cups in toast, following the example of Ni Kuan. Thus, we practice the rustic rites and extend the village feast. There are those of high and low station, elders and youths—none dare transgress. They seek longevity, wealth, ease, and peace, each according to their prayers. We humbly present this memorial in congratulation.\n\nI, your servant, in utmost joy and exultation, bow my head again and again. My heart brims with fervent devotion, earnest and unwavering.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial from the Southern Palace on Behalf of a Man Seeking Peace and Well-Being**\n\nI have heard that the great Dao is without action—who can fathom the myriad mysteries of its profound profundity? Those who receive its deliverance may hope to endure through kalpas without end. Such truths are not for ordinary mortals to hear; only the virtuous are blessed with its fortune.\n\nI observe that so-and-so conducts himself with frugality and humility, his nature upright and gentle. Yet, by an ill-fated alignment of the stars, he has suffered the afflictions of *Shichen*’s malevolence. Through earnest supplication, he has at last found relief from his ailments. Now, in the year of his sixtieth cycle, he encounters his natal day, though his appearance—his hair thinned, his vigor diminished—no longer matches his former self. Though aged and feeble, he is fortunate that the luminous Perfected One has granted him favor. The scriptures revealed from the Jade Bureau offer nothing but texts to dispel misfortune; the teachings expounded upon the Millet Pearl are all canons to deliver humanity. Such merits and virtues may serve as a bridge to salvation.\n\nI, your servant, though unworthy among the Dao’s followers and presumptuous in performing ritual affairs, have contributed not even a fraction of the primordial work’s merit. How dare I repeatedly present my foolish petitions? With reverence, we reflect upon the Sacred Throne of the Southern Palace’s August Emperor: your benevolence is vast and your mercy boundless, your merits untainted by fault. You govern the nine yang’s mysteries, your Sanskrit vows forming the three caverns’ numinous power. The literary tablets record the embryos and forms of all beings; once endowed with shape and visage, you surely safeguard their lives, cherish their spirits, and ensure that the root of the numinous is watered, its branches flourishing and leaves abundant. You cause the primordial fluid to congeal and solidify, its source deep and its flow far-reaching.

      "translated_text": "In the year of *jihai*, coinciding with the seventh evening’s beginning,\nThe *gengshen* rites are recorded, yet I still fear the lurking Three Corpses.\nReverently facing the heavens, I submit this plea in proxy,\nResolving from this day forth to renew myself.\nMay the crown of my head become the cause of blessings,\nAnd may I humbly beseech unseen assistance.\n\nI reverently consider the August Emperor of Southern Florescence of Nanchang,\nThe Great Emperor of Longevity of the Southern Pole,\nAnd the Life-Cherishing Lord Han, the Venerable Man—\nTheir transformative radiance manifests in the Eight Luminaries,\nTheir Dao pervades the Three Spirits.\nTen recitations of scripture deliver humankind;\nNine Yangs are refined into qi.\nVast and majestic their model,\nSerene and boundless their origin.\n\nI implore the Three Realms to descend as one,\nTo record your merits and erase your transgressions.\nMay the multitude of perfected ones be indiscriminately delivered,\nPreserving your life and honoring your form,\nEnabling you to endure through kalpas and abide long.\nDaring to seize this moment of awakening,\nI gaze toward the northern palace in hope of grace,\nThat my name be inscribed in the southern archives,\nReceiving the texts of yellow threads and white tablets,\nEtched in purple characters and golden names.\nMay your years be prolonged,\nEight thousand seasons turning as spring and autumn.\nBestow upon me boundless favor,\nA hundred generations flourishing with descendants.\nAbove, embody the Supreme’s virtue of cherishing life;\nBelow, regard this servant’s earnest entreaty.\n\nGratitude to the master for recommending the completion of merit for the departed.\nI have heard with joy of the *Western Ascension*,\nTransmitted by Lord Lao,\nAnd of the covenant rites receiving the *Yellow Emperor’s Questions on the Yin Talisman*,\nExpounded by Guangchengzi.\nFaithfully received and reverently practiced.\nWere it not for karmic predestination,\nHow could one possess the bone-form of an immortal?\n\nThis servant, trembling with awe,\nBows his head again and again.\nI reflect that my canine-and-horse years have reached eighty;\nThough now aged, I remain capable of one final endeavor.\nThe dragon-and-phoenix scriptures—I have studied but two or three.\nYet even a fool, it is said, may achieve insight through a thousand considerations.\nSince assuming this office,\nI have guarded the Dao with strictness.\nHow can I discipline others\nWithout first demanding it of myself?\nTalent must be tested:\nThose with merit are rewarded,\nThose with transgressions are punished.\nThus may all act with sincerity in virtue,\nAnd prudence in speech.\n\nI reverently consider the Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity, Tranquil Response, and Manifest Protection—\nHis dharma transmitted as Orthodox Unity,\nHis Dao penetrating the subtle mysteries.\nFor ten thousand generations, he is the teacher of rulers,\nThe parent of all living beings.\nHe establishes teachings and regulations,\nThe Great Dharma Master of All Heavens,\nPointing the way to salvation and deliverance,\nRescuing the suffering and liberating the departed,\nAwakening the vow of compassion.\n\nYet I fear that the spirits thus recommended,\nAdrift in the turbid currents of fleeting life,\nMay have unwittingly committed errors.\nIn the endless night’s darkness,\nWho recognizes the marvel of emerging from existence and entering non-existence?\nOnly through merit may this serve as a bridge.\n\nI humbly pray that the Great Dao illuminate,\nThe earth be purged of demonic vapors,\nThe heavens free of drifting haze,\nSoul and spirit purified and rectified.\nLet the smoke-choked gates of death open,\nThe clouds part to reveal the gates of life.\nMay even the darkest yin realms\nAll receive the mysterious grace.\n\n**Refinement and Deliverance Memorial**\n\nI prostrate myself, for at the center of the Azure Heaven,\nThe *Scripture of Deliverance* is proclaimed.\nAfter the kalpa of the August Emperor,\nThe *Stanzas of the Divine Generative Spirit* were covenanted.\nAs the great cycle nears its term,\nThe sacred texts emerge.\n\nThis servant, trembling with fear,\nReflects that my heart remains enslaved to things,\nMy body not yet merged with the true.\nI have not heard of the tortoise-breathing method,\nAnd deeply shame at my crane-hair and dragon-decrepitude.\nYet I lead the prayers with utmost sincerity,\nStriving to practice diligently.\n\nI fear that the departed spirits thus recommended,\nSunk in the dust of worldly illusion,\nEntangled in emotional attachments,\nMay have unwittingly committed errors of thought, word, or intent.\nReturning to the root and restoring the origin—\nWho recognizes the marvel of essence, qi, and spirit?\nSelf-inflicted is the ruin of death;\nWho knows the path to life?\n\nI reverently consider the Great Emperor of the Divine Generative Spirit of the Nine Heavens—\nHis Dao pervades the Three Spirits,\nHis transformative power flows through the Two Luminaries.\nIn the East, he is known as the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful.\nIn Nanchang, he oversees the bureaus of Deliverance and Refinement.\nYin becomes po, yang becomes hun—\nOnly through yin and yang are they tempered.\nFire pertains to the heart, water to the kidneys—\nWithout water and fire, how could life be formed?\n\nI implore the Great Creation to embrace all,\nThe true light to illumine thoroughly,\nThat the foul and putrid be utterly dissolved,\nThe withered and decayed, upon hearing, emit smoke.\nMay bones and flesh take flight together,\nForm and spirit be made whole.\nInner thoughts not stray outward,\nOuter thoughts not intrude within,\nForever cutting off the source of afflictions.\nOnce the register of qi is established,\nAnd the qi of compliance is born,\nA body of empty cavernousness emerges.\nMay all suffering souls\nBathe in this vast grace.\n\nMoreover, the *Scripture of Deliverance*,\nRecited ten times, revives withered bones.\nThe *Stanzas of the Divine Generative Spirit*,\nComprising nine chapters, liberates dark souls.\nThe Supreme attained this\nTo establish teachings and regulations.\nLater students rely on it\nTo rescue the suffering and deliver the departed.\n\nI reverently consider the sacred ranks—\nSeven epochs aligned,\nThree Spirits conjoined,\nAbove embodying the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth.\nYin employs the even, yang the odd;\nWithin, the work of *li* and *kan* is illuminated.\nWater seeks the damp, fire the dry.\nA bridge for the multitude of sufferings,\nA sun and moon for the lost multitudes.\nMy vows are profound,\nMy merit boundless.\n\nI reflect that in recent years, old and senile,\nMy studies have grown neglected.\nTiger mercury and dragon lead—\nI have not mastered the ninefold transmutations and completions.\nBear postures and tortoise breathing—\nI know not the method of one inhalation and one exhalation.\nYet when I previously received the memorial,\nI fulfilled my allotted duty.\nNow, witnessing the filial devotion’s sincerity,\nI reluctantly undertake the rites to preside over them.\n\nI deeply consider the departed souls thus recommended—\nYesterday they possessed living bodies,\nToday they enter the register of the dead.\nBelow, their hun and po are summoned,\nLong wandering in the springs’ curves.\nKnocking on skulls,\nThey have only recently found the joy of returning to their native mounds.\nWithout undergoing the refining furnace,\nHow can they transcend the ordinary?\n\nI implore the Three Realms to descend as one,\nThe multitude of perfected ones to descend,\nTo deliver the dead souls for refinement,\nEnabling them to transform into immortals.\nMerging marvelously, dissolving forms,\nTheir kind dispersed across kalpas\nReturn to the One.\nThey must rely on the power of ascending the primordial,\nEncountering the work of Brahma.\n\nMoreover, in the Azure Vault of Floating Li,\nThe ten recitations of the *Scripture of Deliverance* are expounded.\nFrom the Jade Terrace of Primordial Yang,\nThe nine stanzas of the *Divine Generative Spirit* emerge.\nSince the transmission of these teachings,\nThrough successive masters and disciples.\n\nI reflect that this servant, humbly among

With a single heart we may reach the divine; our shared plea ascends, piercing the ninefold heavens.\n\nWe, the lowly, cling to life like ants and grubs, yet know gratitude. Though we dwell beneath the vast canopy of heaven and earth, our days pass in restless haste, untouched by the burdens of right and wrong. Searching our hearts, we find few who recognize their faults; reviewing our deeds, we see many who have wrought harm. Ever mindful of our fears, we dare rely on the power of this single offering.\n\nMay the gods above and below witness our virtue and guide us left and right. May farmers, artisans, merchants, and scholars rejoice in their livelihoods—thus shall they prosper.\n\n---\n\nThe common people, ignorant, often invoke blessings through borrowed spirits. Yet the Heavenly Lord watches over you, without partiality in rewarding merit or punishing wrong. If He does not deceive us, aid will come to those who act in accord with the Way.\n\nWe, the humble, dwell by the mountains, hewing homes from stone and carving fields from slopes. As the stars of the Crow and the Winnowing Basket appear in mid-spring, we begin our labors in earnest. The barking of dogs carries across the four borders, and we long for the Great Stem. Knowing the hardship of earning our sustenance, we dare not withhold our sincerity in offering thanks.\n\nThough we are frogs at the bottom of a well, unable to grasp the vastness of the world, even ants clinging to a cauldron deserve pity for their lives.

      "translated_text": "The Emperor’s command cannot be defied; with fasting and purification, we may offer sacrifice to the Emperor. Earnest in our pleas, we stand as though in the presence of His radiant majesty. We humbly reflect that we, like ants clinging to a cauldron or frogs at the bottom of a well, are greedy and shallow. Born in the Central Land, we have yet to fulfill our duties to our satisfaction. Now, as the Upper Prime arrives, we still hope for the blessings of the Heavenly Officials. Thus, we rely upon the Daoist adept to proclaim the true rites, reaching upward to the stern judgment of the axe and iron, and downward to the ears of even the lowliest creatures. Though the present may not know the past, we are fortunate that even impure customs may be renewed.\n\nWe pray that those like the Earl of Shen and the Marquis of Fu may rise again, and that those who follow may attain the longevity of Peng and the wealth of Tao, assuredly receiving such blessings. In all our movements and undertakings, we are truly indebted to the virtue of creation and nurture.\n\n---\n\nIn this sixtieth year, on the day of my birth:\nThe Dao ever favors the good, and one must understand the causes of goodness. Our desire for peace has been fulfilled, and our wish for tranquility granted. Respectfully relying upon the Daoist adept, we present these written prayers. We humbly reflect that though my words are unworthy, I have now reached the age of ear-turning. Once afflicted with the ailment of gathering firewood, I now enjoy the blessing of recovery without medicine. Moreover, as the tenth month arrives, I mark my birth once more. Truly, I am indebted to the decree of Heaven and dare not betray my former vows. I pray that my later years may be prosperous and smooth, offering my sincere heart in gratitude. The merit of this act may be measured, and my reverence is as solemn as the fear of the tiger. May my ancestors rest in peace, their memory honored without fail. Looking upward, I seek divine aid; bowing downward, I beg for confirmation.\n\n---\n\n**Thanksgiving Prayer by a Woman for Preemptive Merit**\nRites, when overly elaborate, lead to disorder; only utmost sincerity can move the gods. Heaven guides the heart, and the accumulation of good deeds brings abundant blessings. Looking upward, we beseech the celestial hearing; bowing downward, we reveal our tender sentiments. We humbly reflect that I, your servant, lack the Four Virtues and that my many words are of little benefit. My learning is as unclear as the misreading of \"three pigs,\" and now I approach the years beyond sixty, nearing seventy. My voice is as insignificant as a single fly, yet I fear repeating past mistakes. Removing my hairpin in submission, I gather my robes and present these words, repenting for past transgressions and cultivating future blessings. Further, I pray that my descendants, countless generations hence, may be enrolled in the register of Han Jun. May the Three Longevities be my companions, and may I receive the ode of Lu Hou.\n\n---\n\n**Preemptive Prayer by a Woman for the Yellow Register and Celestial Decree**\nHuman nature may incline toward good or evil, and even a foolish woman may comprehend this. Our desires for longevity and peace are met with Heaven’s favor, which brings only auspiciousness. Bowing low, I offer my enduring reverence; looking upward, I dare to disturb Your majestic countenance. We humbly reflect that I, your wife, am entangled in the desires of the world and submerged in the dust of the mundane. The five defilements of form and sound have surely brought their share of offenses. Though my hair is half-gray, I am fortunate to have reached the year of my birth once more. Overwhelmed and at a loss, I can only repent and give thanks inadequately. Respectfully, on the second day of the second month, I reverently partake in the rites of the Three Realms’ covenant with the true, dedicating the fruits of my merit in hope of Your grace. May this offering extend to my lord, deepening the love that binds us. May my later years be brightened, and may I further seek the joy of playful delight.\n\n---\n\n**Ritual Prayer for Thanksgiving**\nAs the year marks my sixtieth cycle, I find myself at this appointed time. My emotions struggle to reach the heavens, and I cannot avoid repeating my pleas. Rites must not be neglected, and words are spoken when the time is right. We humbly reflect that I, old and feeble, am without ability, confused and unenlightened. Recently afflicted with the lowly ailments of horses and cattle, I cried out to Heaven in desperation. Now, clinging to life like an ant, how can I not be moved by the earth’s compassion? Though my good intentions have taken shape in words, I am fortunate that the radiant gods may perceive my heart. Bowing low, I express my private gratitude; looking upward, I dare to disturb Your exalted hearing. As merit is fulfilled, may my name be inscribed in the golden register and white tally. May I be granted the blessings of abundance, longevity, health, and peace, as bestowed by the *Hong Fan* and *Ji Chou*. Further, I pray that my descendants may bring glory to their forebears.\n\n---\n\n**Prayer for the Ancestral Mother’s Protection**\nTo know gratitude is to know repayment; the August Heaven and Earth indeed hear our solemn words. To serve the dead as we serve the living is the duty of filial sons and obedient grandsons. Thus, we rely upon this pure rite, presumptuously beseeching the true banner. We humbly reflect that I was orphaned at four and received instruction through three relocations. In the past, through my grandmother, I suffered from an incurable blindness; my late father was deeply grieved by my drowning, yet could not save me. Though I repeatedly prayed to the gods, why did misfortune still befall me? Unfortunate in my short life, I wept as I recounted my unfulfilled vows, knowing not how to proceed. Fortunately, over the years, I have come to terms with my fate, easing my heart and freeing it from its initial burdens. The departed flow like this river, and may they soon align with Han Jun’s compassionate work. In the end, may there be care, and may the ode of Lu Hou praising a mother’s longevity be sung.\n\n---\n\n**Prayer for a Wife**\nWhen illness strikes, one calls to Heaven, for there is no other recourse. If dreams bring harm, we seek to understand their cause. Bowing low, I pour forth my sincerity; looking upward, I beseech the celestial hearing. We humbly reflect that I am bound by fate to the Dipper’s middle star, and my affairs are as discordant as Shen and Shang. Lamenting the hardships of my household, why are my family’s fortunes so fraught? Even beasts do not lose their mates—how could I lack the sentiments of the world? Though the bowstring may be rejoined, I cannot avoid new attachments. Despite the ugliness of painted brows and powdered cheeks, why am I afflicted by the misfortune of arrows piercing my chest? Perhaps the love and hate of the reed mat differ, rendering the healing of medicine ineffective. Thus, I have pledged to invoke the True Man of Lingji, proclaiming the repentance of the Nine Truths. I pray that the Most High Lord of the Great Monad may widely bestow His great compassion, releasing me from karmic transgressions and delivering me from suffering. Alas, my former wife—early did she fulfill the cause of the trailing tail. May my descendants be preserved, forever upholding the duty of the silken threads.\n\n---\n\nMoreover:\nHeaven’s brightness is to be revered, for its power is manifest in what is seen and heard—how could it lack ears and eyes?",

One must seek its cause.\n\nI, so-and-so, as a person, now ponder: recalling my late father, he clung to the folly of the waiting tree-stump, never expecting treachery to strike like a stone cast from below.

First, we exhaust the rites of purification and luminous reverence, arranging fragrant mats to humbly lodge our modest sincerity.\n\nWe reflect: our blood and *qi* share the same origin as all flesh. Though our departed kin could but offer the devotion of dogs and horses, how dare we forget the gratitude of crows and magpies? Time flows like this river—yet we err in composing these summoning verses. Yet if faults can be dissolved, we have heard it may be done in the space between turning palms.\n\nRespectfully following the Mysterious Code, we solemnly invite the feathered adepts to perform these meritorious deeds and establish this karmic connection.\n\nWe humbly pray that the Three Officials of the Northern Fengdu may scrutinize the ghostly camps and swiftly expunge the ledgers of sin. May our countless ancestors ascend to the Golden Gates, each finding their path to rebirth. May all the lost and deluded together attain joy and liberation.\n\n**Prayer for Averting Disaster**\n\nHarmonious *qi* brings auspiciousness, while discordant *qi* brings anomalies—Heaven’s ways are inscrutable and without constancy. The Way of fortune lengthens as the Yin Way wanes; the return of the sun may be awaited.\n\nWe bow in lowly submission and gaze upward in presumptuous address.\n\nWe reflect: though we have fortunately secured safety, we have failed to maintain it. Though the multitudes petition for disaster-averting rites, we petty folk know the shame of our transgressions. None dares face the sunflower’s devotion; we can but fear the depths of the abyss. How can our village compare? We have but a humble puddle’s worth of reverence.\n\nThus we gather the Daoist clergy to solemnly conduct the ritual. We trust the people’s plight is easily seen and pray the Emperor’s wrath may be turned.\n\nWe humbly beseech that sand be transformed into harmony, sparing us the dread of neglected sacrifices. May we be granted longevity and prosperity, and may abundant blessings descend.\n\n**Prayer for Preserving Fortune**\n\nThe Way of Heaven speaks not, yet responds—we offer our earnest supplications. The human heart’s desires, when sincere, must surely evoke a resonant response.\n\nWe inscribe this in our hearts, knowing our debt is profound.\n\nWe reflect: we, so-and-so, rely solely upon the divine, having no merits to recount. Yet we have been doubly favored by Heaven’s bounty and honored by our master’s grace. Recently, we entrusted Chen Daoxing with the *Dragon-Tiger* rites, and indeed received great protection. Now, with Elder Guo Yong, we fulfill the *Cricket’s* repayment, refusing to renege on our word.\n\nThough this is the people’s hope, how dare we claim any credit for Heaven’s power? We further pray for the bestowal of the *gui zan* scepter, that we may await summons in the Purple Tenuity, and for the offering of fine grains, that the spirits may be at peace in the Pure Temple.\n\n**Establishing the Ritual of Crossing: Petition**\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy expounded the teachings, pointing the way to salvation. For children honoring their parents, the foremost path is filial reverence.\n\nWe bow in earnest address, gazing upward to the azure vault.\n\nWe reflect: we, so-and-so, dwell in the dust. Though we have fortunately lived through the final kalpa, we recall those who bore and raised us, whose nurturing love was as deep as the canopy of heaven. Yet they linger between existence and oblivion—how hateful is the barrier between light and dark! Thus we rely on the feathered adepts to perform the true rites.\n\nToday, we open the Mysterious Altar, seeking to ascend our prayers to the Imperial Palace. May our humble sincerity move the divine, and may great proof be granted.\n\nWords cannot express our joy: the assembled hosts from the ten directions witness the deliverance of the living and the dead. By the grace bestowed upon the nine hundred, all hearts are poured forth. May the lost in the underworld all ascend to the shore of the Dao.\n\n**Moreover,**\n\nThe hearing of Heaven is impartial; may it deign to perceive even a fraction of our foolish sincerity.",

Yet there are matters that admit no delay.\n\nWe reflect: though we are but gnats in nature, ants in survival, each possesses a human heart—how could we lack good intentions? Now, as the Zhongyuan Festival approaches, we begin our fast eight days prior, wishing to forge karmic bonds with all beings. Thus we undertake the Nine Mornings’ Universal Deliverance, humbly invoking sacred power and beseeching the bestowal of gracious light. We dare offer our private gratitude, striving to manifest reverence from beginning to end. Further, we pray for the five viscera to be cleansed and cool, the six bowels harmonized and at peace. May the old regain their vigor, the young grow strong. May the Three Realms provide guardianship, the Five Emperors oversee their reception. May the *po* ascend, the *hun* be liberated.\n\nMoreover,\nThough Heaven’s height seems boundless, it never strays from the square inch of the heart. As mortals, we must be vigilant from the outset, ever mindful of the perils of neglecting the fast. Following the Yellow Register’s rites, we draw near to the purple radiance to invoke the sacred. Deeply reliant on the vast creation’s workings, we open wide the path of salvation. May the darkness of the underworld be illuminated, the long night ended, and the light of Yang Valley be beheld—each soul restored to spring.\n\n**Second Morning’s Invocation**\nThe Dao is beyond naming—yet this very Heaven is called the Dao. Through fasting, reverence may be achieved. Pouring forth the sincerity of sunflowers turning to the sun, we beseech that the qi of fragrant herbs may move the divine. We pray for universal deliverance, benefiting both the living and the dead. As the departed flow like this river, may their *hun* return to Heaven, their *po* to Earth. For the living, may nurturance abound—blessings vast as the sea, longevity steadfast as mountains.\n\n**Third Morning’s Invocation**\nIn serving the dead and the living, we fulfill the filial piety due to our honored parents. In revering the end as we revered the beginning, we uphold the solemnity of discipline. Our gratitude ascends to the Nine Heavens; our rites span three days. Completing the Nine Mornings’ Dao, we pray for the illumination of the Eight Luminaries, that our embodied selves may endure. May the names of the departed be inscribed early upon the Cinnabar Terrace’s stone chambers, and their souls find proof of refinement. Through the merit of the Golden Register and White Petitions, may all in darkness and light alike receive deliverance.\n\n**Establishing the Morning Audience**\nHeaven’s hearing is never distant; we ever hold our private sincerity in mind. Yet human affairs must end—how can we avoid repeated supplication? Overwhelmed and ashamed, we, the foolish and ignorant, reflect: fortunate to have attained human form, we are ever favored by the Emperor’s gaze, with abundance to our left and right. Knowing how to serve the dead and the living, we rely on the incense of cultivation to perfect this morning audience. We pray that the Eastern Realm of Eternal Joy and the Western Land of Na may both radiate light; that the Northern Springs’ Winding Palace and the Southern Palace of Shangchang may together achieve universal deliverance. May all sentient beings attain transcendence.\n\n**Dispersing the Morning Audience**\nThe Heavenly Dao defies naming, yet it is wise and luminous. In the order of human relations, filial piety and reverence must come first. We prostrate ourselves, pouring forth our sorrow, lifting our voices to the azure vault. We reflect: dwelling in the Central Land, we share this private devotion. Through the purity of our fast, we fulfill the Way of honoring parents, mindful that though we were nurtured in life, we failed to fully repay their warmth. Alas, the departed flow like this river, and the barrier between light and dark remains. Relying on the merit of this morning audience, we seek to make it a bridge to liberation. May the Emperor’s hearing be moved; may your deeds be recorded, your sins erased, and the people’s sincerity be seen. Extending to the departed, preserving for the living, we pray that all in the underworld may ascend to the shore of the Dao.\n\nMoreover,\nThe Emperor watches over you—let your heart know no duplicity, as if he stood to your left and right. All people possess constancy, cherishing virtue and honoring parents. We pour forth our crimson sincerity, lifting our voices to the vault of Heaven. We reflect: as children, we ever strive to honor our thoughts—yet the departed are gone like this river, while the living have failed to nurture them. Step by step, we prostrate ourselves, gazing toward Mount Tai to offer our devotion. Thrice we bathe, thrice we burn incense, relying on our revered masters to present our petitions. May the realms of light and dark alike receive the grace of deliverance. In the human realm, may the young grow strong, the old regain their vigor. May the dead be refined, their forms established, their spirits preserved. May all in the underworld attain the fruit of the Dharma.\n\n**A Daughter’s Petition for Her Father**\nIn the shadowy night’s prison, we lament the nine hells’ depths of suffering. In the dawn’s courtyard, we later behold the five lights’ brilliance. We prostrate ourselves, pouring forth our sincerity, lifting our voices to the pure. We reflect: our father’s flesh has barely cooled, his voice still lingers—how could we, as children, ever forget the Way of serving parents? Fortunate that the Heavenly Worthy has stirred a heart of salvation, responding to cries for aid. Relying on the power of incense and cultivation, we dare express our private gratitude. We pray that the fifty-three years of floating obstacles and hardships may all be erased, that the hundred thousand *qi* of the formless void may be drawn forth. May all sentient beings attain birth and transformation, ascending together to the Great Dao.\n\nMoreover,\nThe Dao is beyond words—through ten thousand million kalpas, its form defies description. Father, where have you gone? Fifty-three years passed like a fleeting colt. In quiet reflection, who could bear this? We reflect: our father met his end in the dust of this fleeting world. Though his clothing and food were sufficient to ease his brow, and no illness suddenly afflicted him, Heaven is high, Earth distant—who could restore his *po* and summon his *hun*? The moon is cold, frost bitter—who could not weep in sorrow? Relying on this merit, we make it a bridge. Having received deliverance, how could we forget our gratitude? We pray that the Three Officials may swiftly erase his name from the ledgers of sin, uprooting all evil. May the Five Emperors oversee his journey to the Jade Capital, his ascent to the Golden Gates.\n\nMoreover,\nOur father’s kindness remains unrepayed—we rely on the merit of deliverance to turn back the Emperor’s wrath. We pray for the stirring of compassion; having received mercy, who would dare forget the source? We reflect: our sins have accumulated upon our person, extending calamity to our father. Though we harbor private grief, we cannot voice it—we can only pray that the Dharma’s form may uphold us. Having bathed our bodies and refined our forms, we have already presented our petition to the Vermilion Mound. Laying bare our livers and gallbladders, we now inscribe these words in jade.",

May our humble sincerity move the divine, and may great proof be granted.\n\nWords cannot express our joy: the assembled hosts from the ten directions witness the deliverance of the living and the dead.

May the lost in the underworld all ascend to the shore of the Dao.\n\n**Moreover,**\n\nThe hearing of Heaven is impartial; may it deign to perceive even a fraction of our foolish sincerity.",

Measured by human affairs, he did no wrong—why then was he forsaken by fate? Six years of confinement left his limbs as though shackled, bringing the twin fiends’ nightmare to his very marrow, or perhaps the Three Corpses’ calamity arose from his torpor. His illness has reached its crisis—who now knows the plan to restore his rest? Here I weep, barely fulfilling the duty of a filial child. Grieving and harboring resentment, I can only lay bare my plea.\n\nFortunately, in the long kalpas to come, the teachings will endure, so that beneath King Yama’s throne, grievances may be unbound and enmities released. Perhaps through wondrous power, a method to revive life may be offered.\n\nWe humbly pray that his marks of excellence may flourish, his karmic bonds from past lives be severed.

      "translated_text": "Prostrate, I beseech the August Emperor: though He has not absolved, how could one fail to offer reverence with a humble heart? Without a father, what refuge remains? The youngest daughter’s sorrow is unbearable. Bowing low, I pour forth my sincerity; lifting my gaze, I implore the lofty ear of Heaven.\n\nI recall how my father’s untreatable abscess brought him to death, his flesh not yet cold. Perhaps he appeared in a vision of light, his countenance filled with sorrow—who could cast him aside, unmoved? Who would not plead with deepest urgency? Like Ye Chang, though innocent, he suffered the weight of public judgment; like Zeng Shen, falsely accused of murder, he endured suspicion that could not be dispelled. For three years, grief has weighed upon me; for nine springs, resentment has lingered in the Yellow Springs. Had I not served him with utmost devotion, who would deem his deep wrongs redeemable? I humbly pray that the karma of many lives be pardoned, that he not be bound and pressed into the ranks of ghosts. May the enmities of past ages be released, and from this moment of awakening, may all be aided by the power of the Dao.\n\nAgain, prostrate, I reflect: my father’s loss is grievous—how can one endure the sorrow of his death? Though his daughter was wed to a neighbor, she could not fulfill her wish to return and bring him peace. Bowing low, I offer my earnest devotion; lifting my gaze, I disturb the vault of Heaven.\n\nI recall how my father attended to his duties with diligence and managed his household with frugality. Though he had but slightly expanded his fields, he widely extended the intentions of our ancestors. Though his family faced many hardships, he strove to repay the debts of his sons. His kindness remained unrequited, yet my heart holds it deeply. I had hoped that in his later years, he might enjoy good fortune and preserve his life. Yet half his years passed like a bubble’s shadow. After twenty days of illness, the abscess had not yet burst, but his gall had already perished. At the end of four seven-day cycles, his soul might be summoned, but his spirit would not fade. To bow before the Vermilion Mound and cross the threshold of life, one must rely on the Daoist priest to present these words. By the grace of the vast celestial bed, may his past karma be forever absolved, and may he depart the winding paths of the Yellow Springs to awaken to the moment of liberation. Since there is a Heavenly Paradise, may he dwell in the realm of carefree wandering.\n\nAgain, prostrate, I lament: my five viscera are torn asunder, yet I must sever my love for my late father. Though a hundred bodies could not repay him, the youngest daughter’s sorrow is unbearable. Bowing low, I pour forth my sincerity; lifting my gaze, I implore the lofty ear of Heaven.\n\nI recall how my father, though his children’s marriages were settled, endured such hardship. His burden never lightened from his shoulders, and illness clung to him like an abscess upon his back. The stars dimmed and fell, breaking my heart like the fleeting lotus of a dream. Days and months passed, and in the blink of an eye, sixty days slipped away. I long to sing the *Summons of the Soul* like Song Yu, yet dare I present the plea of Ti Ying to redeem a crime? I humbly pray that his name be erased from the Black Register, that he may soon receive the Golden Register and White Tablet. May he bow before the Vermilion Mound and be delivered through the fires and waters of the ritual pools. May all who have sunk into suffering together ascend to joy.\n\n**Petition for the Blood Bowl to Deliver the Mother**\n\nProstrate, I reflect: the Eighty-Four Thousand Kalpas of the Feathered Realm stretch boundless, without shore. The Fifty-Three Buddhas of the Blood Bowl vow to deliver all beings. If one can create such karmic conditions, the merit is inconceivable.\n\nI recall how I, born a woman, once honored my mother’s example. Yet my love for her was like the magpie’s, and I could not repay her as the people of Juqiong did. Forty-nine years have passed—where now is her voice and form? One hundred and six days have flown by like the months and years. How could she not think of me? I must rely on the power of the Buddha to awaken the dream beneath the scholar-tree and enlighten her to past causes, that she may gladly attend the feast of reeds. By this, may the later fruit be perfected, and may she reverently welcome the Three Realms. May all in the ten directions be illuminated, and may the eighteen layers of hell be shattered, each prison opened. Without passing through a hundred million kalpas, may all beings in every kalpa attain deliverance. May her true body be purified, so that no orchid-scented waters are needed to wash her tassels. May her Dharma-eye be opened, so that no golden needle is required to scrape away her film. From this moment onward, may all be made new. May she receive life and nurture, forever free from suffering.\n\nIn the court of King Yama, may she indeed receive the grace of Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva. In the Tuṣita Palace, may she join her palms and listen to the teachings of Lady Māyā.\n\n**Petition for the Husband and Daughter**\n\nProstrate, I reflect: the Most High cherishes life, yet why was his life not granted its full span? Since ancient times, death has been inevitable—yet who pities this departed soul? Beating the earth, I hear no response; calling to Heaven, I make my plea.\n\nI recall how I, knowing my fate to be meager, never found a proper match. I think of my daughter, her mouth still smelling of milk, her ignorance profound, and my husband, whose topknot of hair had barely been tied in gratitude—why was his illness incurable? After only eight days, he perished. What could be done? I am left with lifelong regret. O soul, where have you gone? Forever you return to the endless night.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I offer this blood-written plea, hoping that my feelings may be considered and my sins redeemed.",

      "translated_text": "Reflecting on the weight of merit and virtue, the transmission of talismans is inscribed in golden registers and white missives. Surely father and son ascend together, their names etched upon the jade chambers and cinnabar terraces. May all good destinies share in this grace.\n\n**Prayer for Husband and Child**\nProstrate, I consider: earth stretches far and heaven endures long, yet none hear the suffering of the wronged. Frost chills and the moon gleams—who knows the sorrow of the widowed? I dare not speak at length, yet fear I overstep again.\n\nI recall how I, born through kalpas of suffering, endured these two losses. The joy of our family’s rise faded like ephemeral blossoms; the hope of a full life shattered like a broken mirror. Since length of days is fated, what can I do? I know not the cause of good or ill that brought me to this extremity. Though living and dead are sundered, by merit and virtue one may yet ascend. Let me but express my love for my child and convey my longing for home. Though his voice and form seem present, I can only imagine them in the empty courtyard. Where has his soul gone? I pray he may be delivered to the Crimson Mansion, that even the hidden and shadowed beings may together return to the boundless Mahāyāna.\n\n**Prayer for Father from Child**\nProstrate, I reflect: the August Heaven above watches over all and has not forsaken me. In serving the dead as the living, a filial child and obedient descendant offers all. Deeply ashamed of this humble petition, I fear it borders on excessive reverence.\n\nI recall how I, fortunate to dwell among human relations, barely upheld our family’s legacy. Knowing the source of a spring’s flow, how could I not strive to repay its origin? Moved by the scene before me, I express my longing and remembrance. Though my forebear’s remains rest in the grave, all was guided by the divine. Seizing this opportunity, I humbly accept this ascension and dare not forget to offer thanks. Though his spirit does not return, may it wander the dim and silent realms. Virtue is hard to repay; with this simple rite of supplication, I look up to the Great Dao and extend blessings to the underworld.\n\n**Prayer for Parents**\nProstrate, I consider: how vast is Heaven above—how dare I not offer my utmost loyalty? Even a child in arms loves its parents—who lacks this filial piety? Ashamed to repeat myself, I have already stated my plea.\n\nI recall how we, in deep reflection, ever bear the difficulty of serving the dead as the living. In our conduct toward others and ourselves, we find no virtue or filial piety to praise. Thus, we turn to the Emperor of the Eastern Peak and Mount Tai, praying that all beings may together return to the Great Dao. May all men and women devote themselves wholly, all be protected and delivered, and all attain longevity. May spirits hear these hidden words and ascend, spared from suffering.\n\n**Prayer for Father and Ancestors**\nProstrate, I reflect: the grace of Heaven and Earth is profound, and I bow in gratitude for their nurturing virtue. The crisp air of frost and dew—who does not feel the sorrow of offering mugwort? Humbly, I pour forth my sincerity, prostrating before the Azure Heavens.\n\nI recall how I, bound by worldly dust, possess awareness of blood and breath. I cherish the toil of my father and grandmother, mindful of the teachings like those of Kaoshu. In life, I served them; in death, I buried them—this may be called filial, yet I strive to offer my utmost sincerity. Rising early and retiring late, I do not shame my origins. How shall I repay them? Last winter, I vowed to hold the Great Yellow Register Fast, performing rites of thanksgiving and expressing reverence through posthumous offerings.\n\nI pray that their yellowed forms be purified, their jade eyes refined, and their true precepts followed in the School of Purity and Light. May the Southern Palace’s flying crow and the Northern Bureau’s spirits ascend, their talismanic commands fulfilled in speech.\n\n**Prayer for Ancestors**\nProstrate, I reflect: human relations are rightly ordered, deepening the heart of filial piety. The Dao of Heaven is constant, and we truly bear its nurturing virtue. I prepare the sacred altar and humbly invoke the true healing.\n\nI recall how we, bound by worldly duties, live as descendants. The merit of ancestors and the virtue of our lineage protect us, their descendants—how fortunate! With sincere hearts and earnest intent, we place our trust in the spirits without doubt. Let me briefly express my plea and perform this special rite. Ashamed of my repeated petitions, I yet hope for a fraction of private grace.\n\nI pray that the Nine Dark Realms open the way, holding the texts of the Yellow Register. May the Eight Radiant Scenes shine forth, and may we behold the golden-purple visage. Further, I beseech blessings upon our descendants and grace upon the living.\n\n**Prayer of the Perfected One Seeking Forgiveness**\nI have heard that humans, as the most enlightened of beings, knowing their faults, must correct them. Spirits leave no trace for judgment—how can one call them wrong? Yet why do they act wrongly? It is because they rely on humans to act, and thus cannot escape the flattery of ghosts.\n\nI, your servant, hold a sacred office in the Golden Towers of the Nine Heavens. Since the Kaiyun era, my shrine has received offerings. From the Kaixi era onward, my temple has been honored with imperial decrees. Though I possess the numinous power of grass and trees, I know not the wonder of ascending as a saint or perfected one. Thus, I have observed fasts, upheld precepts, accumulated goodness, and built merit, advancing to the ranks of immortals. I have been entrusted with duties in the unseen realm, performing my tasks with care—how slight my virtue!\n\nYet I fear that in using medicine to save lives, I may not distinguish the properties of *aconite* and *cinnamon*, *magnolia* and *poria*. In using literature to exhort the world, I may not recognize the errors of *Lu*, the foolish, *Hai*, or *Cheng*. Or in divination, I may fail to deliver the oracle. Or like the wild goose, I may not find rest. I may pray for clear skies, only to bring rain, turning crops to ruin in the summer heat. Or I may pray for rain, only to bring drought, incurring blame from the Wind Earl. Some say good and evil have their retribution—yet why does good not bring good, and evil not evil, like the vanished state of Guo? Or that fortune and misfortune move people—yet why does fortune not bring fortune, and misfortune not misfortune, like the horse of the old man of the frontier?\n\nSome die young, not by fate, misled by shamans’ words into slander. Some live in poverty and hardship, blamed on ghosts’ deceit, unable to rise. Some village festivals involve offerings of meat and wine, violating the precepts. Some communal feasts borrow kitchens, offending the fast. Thus, *chimei* and *wangliang* seize the opportunity to ride their *men* carts, while the sins of *taotie* and those who pray with peach wood have no escape.\n\nIn deep anxiety and fear, I tremble uncontrollably. Fortunately, the Most High has sworn a vow of compassion, and the Great Dao provides rites of repentance. Humbly, I stand before the sacred presence and confess my failings.",
      "overlap_context": " meager, never found a proper match. I think of my daughter, her mouth still smelling of milk, her ignorance profound, and my husband, whose topknot of hair had barely been tied in gratitude—why was his illness incurable? After only eight days, he perished. What could be done? I am left with lifelong regret. O soul, where have you gone? Forever you return to the endless night.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I offer this blood-written plea, hoping that my feelings may be considered and my sins redeemed.",

      "translated_text": "I humbly beseech the renewal of the old and the proclamation of amnesty for calamities. May past transgressions of reckless words be redeemed, and future diligence in service be demanded, that all may be pacified.\n\nIn governance, I dare not stir up trouble, nor seek merit through toil and hardship. In personal conduct, I dare not hold office without earning my keep. To succor the living and deliver the dead, to aid the upright and expel the wicked—I shall exert myself in practice and repay with utmost loyalty.\n\nMoreover, I hope that my person may enter the radiance of the precious pearl, and my every step fulfill the Three Thousand Precepts. Though my virtue lacks the fragrance of millet and rice, may my sacrifices endure for a hundred generations. The devotion of your servant is boundless, earnest to the utmost.\n\n**Thanksgiving for the Bestowal of the Title \"Perfected\"**\n\nI prostrate myself before the majestic lineage of the Great Dao, to which my heart wholly turns in reverence. From the vast expanse of the Great Luo above, the Three Realms all bear witness. How profound is the Celestial Emperor’s favor, and how unfailing the wisdom of the divine beings!\n\nReflecting on my joy, which shook the earth, and the grace that descended from heaven—though ranks are apportioned with distinction, I know my sixteen-character title exceeds all bounds. Where rites grow excessive, disorder follows; I deeply fear the full measure of the thousand-two-hundred-part cycle. Yet through broad consultation, all concur it is both fine and fitting.\n\nThus, I offer the reverence of fasting and purification to express my private gratitude. I humbly pray that in receiving emoluments, I may benefit the people, and that my yang merits be made manifest. Show me the path of illustrious virtue, and bestow further honor upon my yin office.\n\n**Again,**\n\nHeaven’s constancy favors those with virtue; without virtue, one cannot move Heaven. The sage does not claim to know the divine, yet only the divine may enter the sage. With sincerity, I bow and lift my gaze to the azure vault.\n\nI recall that my homeland lies beneath the shade of mulberry and elm, bound in communal kinship. The title \"Spiritual Relief\" has endured for over four hundred years, and its boundless benevolence has been revealed to all under heaven. The people, content in their sufficiency, cherish it without end. Thus, the favor bestowed upon the master has grown ever greater. Gathering the feathered and robed, I prepare humble offerings, pledge alliance with the Three Realms, and dare not betray the grace of former days. Through the grand Rite of Thanksgiving to the Heavenly Net, I may perhaps express this heartfelt reverence. I further hope for your radiant presence at the ritual seat, that blessings may be conferred upon all people.\n\n**Prayer for the Protection of Crops**\n\nHeaven does not speak, yet its goodness responds—when it is said to rain, rain comes in its season. When people desire and follow, blessings sought arrive in full. With sincerity, I bow and lift my gaze to the azure vault.\n\nI recall that my humble abode shelters beneath the vast turning of the cosmos, like a swallow nesting in a tent’s eaves. Should I ever fail in reverence, I shall surely correct my faults. My plea is not for external gain but only to avert disaster. Since I have already received abundant grace, I still pray for its fulfillment. Having been touched by this favor, how can I ever rest in ease? I shall ever hold the fear and trembling of one who has received much. I beg for your compassion and dare not forget to repay your virtue.\n\nI pray that the young grow strong and the old remain vigorous, that men and women alike may thrive. May the lowlands know no dampness, the heights no drought, and may all be filled with abundance.\n\n**Again,**\n\nThe people regard food as heaven; I deeply fear that Heaven’s heart may send down reproach. Even when the Xia prayed for grain from the thousand gods, they still hoped the Emperor’s wrath might be turned away. Below, I lead the people’s sentiments; above, I appeal to Heaven’s hearing.\n\nI recall that we, who look up in service and down in nurture, are many in number. From spring plowing to autumn harvest, the year’s labor nears completion, and we hope for abundant fields and plentiful crops. Yet if pests or minor blights arise, how can we atone through our offerings? Only by removing harm can benefit flourish; only by doing good can auspicious omens descend.\n\nMay the wind blow gently, the clouds gather lightly—thus shall the vegetables and salted offerings be presented. May the harvest be reaped in abundance, the grain piled high—thus shall the millet and rice be fittingly offered.\n\n*Xu Xian’s Florilegium, Scroll Ten Concludes*\n*Xu Xian’s Florilegium, Scroll Eleven*",

Fathers, in their kindness, instruct—how could this depend on the carving of wheels? Sons, in their filiality, admonish—how much more do they honor the towering trees of their forebears. Elder and younger brothers, like the *chi* and *xun* flutes, take turns sounding the harmony of the household’s zither. True friendship, rooted in heartfelt exchange, is praised like the clans of Xiao, Zhu, Wang, and Gong. When righteousness runs deep, it is revered like the bonds of Xing, Jin, Ying, and Han. Such is the foundation of moral instruction, the unshakable pillar of human relations.\n\nLet none oppress the weak with strength, nor overwhelm the few with the many. Let none neglect kin for strangers, nor allow the lowly to surpass the noble. When the cap of the superior and the sandals of the inferior remain in their rightful places, when names and ranks are preserved, then the scales of justice will be balanced, and great peace may be hoped for. Then shall culture and renown flourish—could this be mere jade, silk, bells, or drums?\n\nTo propagate transformation and uphold the current, one must embody Heaven’s Dao to bring blessings. To observe customs and examine mores, one must apply effort in human affairs. As for the promotion or demotion of the unseen and the manifest, rewards and punishments must be certain. Among those who oversee the city gods and earthly spirits, some may quell disasters of water and fire, some may bring rain and sunshine in due season, some may settle the wild geese in peace, and some may cause the tortoise and milfoil to speak. Where virtue is worthy of praise and merit is recorded, they shall be publicly recommended and duly promoted. But if they are dull-witted and unresponsive, if they fawn like false ghosts, if they cling to corrupt customs and are called licentious, if their foul deeds are notorious yet they refuse to reform—then they have brought calamity upon themselves, and disaster shall befall their persons.

      "translated_text": "**Proclamation for the Jade Palace’s Conferral of the Immortal Tablet and the Grand Offering of the Luo Heaven**\n\nTo the Three Heavenly Gates, the Perfected of the Jade Palace, who currently hold office—once appointed as Recorder of the Thunder Bureau’s Mysterious Ministry, once as the Supreme Minister of Longevity in the Southern Culmen—harmonizing the myriad transformations and governing the care of all living beings.\n\nWind to nourish the people, rain to nourish the people, regulating cold and heat, yin and yang in balanced order. Clothing to clothe us, food to feed us, ensuring mulberry and hemp, grain and millet bring abundance and prosperity. When forms are knit, men chant reverence, women chant devotion. When spirits descend, the moon becomes the essence, the sun the soul. Each has its office, each its appointed duty, fortunate to attain liberation through karmic conditions. Embodying the Dao and virtue to shed radiant light, enabling Yang Zhen to transmit purity and integrity through his lineage. Thus, Bi must surely regain his rank as lord and marquis—what wisdom may grasp, folly cannot, for what is granted by man is also granted by Heaven.\n\nAs for prayers for rain or sunshine, one may move unseen through heaven and earth. The Minister of Agriculture oversees the harvest, the Director of Silks manages hemp and flax—each holds their rightful post. The Market Official regulates commerce, the Artisan Inspector refines materials—none neglect their duties. Yet if one follows deviant paths, failing to reflect on the root, allowing demons and malevolence to arise and inflict harm, this is the bitter brew you have brewed yourself—though you may repent, can it be undone?\n\nWhether the spirits of *chimei* and *wangliang* run rampant, spreading poison, or the monstrous *taotie* and *taowu* perpetuate treachery and deceit, this office shall never conceal or tolerate such acts. By law, we shall act, ensuring that in the yang realm, the guilty face the punishment of dismemberment, and in the yin realm, their forms are shattered to pieces. We shall sever them with the wind-knife, strike them with the thunder-axe—what man may kill, Heaven shall condemn. Whose fault is this, if not your own?\n\nMoreover, this office has sworn to aid the upright and eradicate the perverse, to succor the living and deliver the dead. Now, filial sons and obedient grandsons, having turned their hearts toward the Dao, first enable their countless ancestors—from parents to great-great-grandparents—to ascend according to their vows. And for the lonely souls and stagnant spirits of the Five Ancient Paths and Three Wretched Realms, though long sunk in suffering, all shall partake in the grace of Heaven.\n\nApart from the memorial already submitted to the True Bureau of the Three Realms and the City God, this proclamation is hereby issued for public notice.\n\n---\n\n**Proclamation of the Bestowal of Honors and Transmission to the Upper Mystery Gate**\n\nWe humbly consider: the Nine Qi abide within the Cavernous Mystery, guarded by the divine. The boundless multitudes of the Ten Directions arrive upon the void. They attend our august presence, bearing witness to the Great Dao. Incense rises in clouds, thick and fragrant; lamps intermingle with the radiance of stars and moon. From afar, we govern the Nine Heavens, solemnly conducting the Three Offerings. With utmost reverence, we serve the Celestial Emperor—how awe-inspiring!\n\nThe divine, vast and responsive, fulfill their duties. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, all receive deliverance. The realm is at peace, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great harmony. Let all officials under your charge attend diligently to their posts.\n\nWe invoke the numinous waters of the Most High, recite the jade texts of the Primordial Beginning. The Five Emperors attend the Perfected, the viscera grow cool and clear. The nation is at ease, the people cultivate simplicity, and all demons withdraw in silence. Ghostly spirits vanish, malevolence subsides. Let this be made known—may all take heed.\n\nThus, the proclamation is issued.\n\n---\n\n**Notice to the Patron of the Retreat, Drafted on Behalf of the High Priest**\n\nIt is said: there is life, and there is death—life and death follow separate paths. Yet to serve the dead as one serves the living is to unite death and life as one. As descendants, how can one lack humaneness? Moreover, this body, this form, was not born among the mulberry trees, nor were your father and mother ever cast upon the waters. If you understand this, how can you not reflect?\n\nStaging colorful performances in the hall—today’s so-called \"old vegetables\"—how countless they are! Weeping in grief by the roadside—today’s so-called \"Gao Yu\"—are there none among them? One should sip bean broth and drink water, fulfilling the joy of filial devotion. Why must one, like a dried fish tied with rope, harbor endless regret?\n\nBetter a cup of spring wine than slaughtering oxen for an extravagant burial. Though you may grieve that the wind and trees never cease, rejoice that heaven and man have this meeting. By observing the retreat and upholding the precepts thus, one may revive the dead and restore the bones—those who accept their lot.\n\nIf ancestors cherish their grandsons with love, how can descendants lack the awareness to reciprocate? Uncles are praised—why wait for the day of gathering pearls? Nephews are not fools—why must they ride in procession on horseback to care for their orphans? Ever mindful of their elder brothers’ lineage, they shelter their descendants; ever pitying their younger brothers’ early deaths, they nurture their offspring.\n\nWhether in the joy of wedding cups or the sorrow of a broken lute, whether in the oaths of shaved heads or the delight of raised brows, as husband and wife, predestined by past lives—through life and death, true affection is revealed. These are the greatest of human bonds, upon which the teachings of propriety depend.\n\nThough still in infancy, none fail to love their parents. We rely upon the Supreme Emperor, who possesses the virtue of cherishing life. Vastly opening the path of deliverance, both the living and the dead benefit. Now, in observance of the Zhongyuan Festival’s continuation of the Xuandu tradition, we reverently join the assembly in establishing the karmic conditions for universal deliverance.\n\nLet good men and good women each awaken their virtuous hearts. Whether near or far, all shall be naturally unobstructed. The merit is extraordinary—merit beyond thought, inconceivable.\n\nWe look up to the retreat’s patron, who deigns to attend the ritual seat. Though you have turned toward the Dao, you also possess a filial and obedient heart. The earth has no prisons, yet Heaven has its halls—separated by no more than a foot’s distance. Good deeds accumulate like mountains, evil runs deep as the sea—even a slight deviation may lead to vast disparity.\n\nThose who do not understand me—what do you seek? You must seek within yourself. I, so-and-so, a humble student of the Heavenly Abode, presumptuously preside over the mysteries of the Dao. Were it not for the presence of the sacred and the drawing of lots, how dare I affix my name and title? Though I lack the capacity to deliver others, I only follow the Dao in my conduct.\n\nShould any in this altar fail in loyalty, the luminous statutes shall impose their penalties. Without addition or omission, let none act with deceitful intent—only with a sincere heart and upright will may merit be fulfilled and virtue perfected.\n\nThus, thus.\nKnow this, know this.",

Though our gates differ and our households diverge, the principle remains one while the rites vary—each striving to transform the people and perfect customs, each holding filial devotion and ancestral reverence in mind. At such a time, how can one not reflect?\n\nVast is the heavens, its qi pure and clear.\nThe grasses [sway] softly, the people hushed and still.\nGazing at the bright moon over Dongting, why wear sorrow like a sash?\nSinging of the crisp wind at Red Cliff, why weep and wail thus?\n\nI turn to my shadow and sigh,\nmy heart grieved, my breath heavy.\nThis body, this hair and skin—bequeathed by my father and mother—how shall I repay them?\nThe fields and homes, the clothing and food of my parents—accumulated virtue of my ancestors—how shall I repay them?\n\nMy ancestor, the Grand Mentor Xie, his admonitions—what day dare I forget?\nMy uncle, Minister Xue, his parted wealth—his kindness was not small.\nThe line *\"Ponds grow grass\"*—this is why Xie of Linchuan dreamed of his brother.\nThe passage *\"Offering water-plants\"* in the *Spring and Autumn*—this is why Han Changli longed for his elder brother.\n\nYet when the younger sister of Yuanwai passed, why begrudge the carved stone?\nWhen the younger sister of Huang the Grand Historian died, why resent the shattered wall?\nStriking the basin and singing, how hard to sever the love of Zhuangzi’s garden.\nSwearing vows upon the boat, how could she break the pact of Gong Jiang’s alliance?\n\nWhat heart is this? What heart indeed?\nThey are human, and I too am human.\nPondering this, what can one say?\n\nThe long night stretches on—deceitfully performing the rites of summoning the soul and calling back the spirit.\nThe Great Lofty Realm is distant—yet fortunately, there exists the method to revive the dead and restore the body.\n\nYou, such people, should vow to cultivate all good fruits and plant this noble cause. Moreover, as the kalpa nears its end, twelve myriad souls shall be chosen to fill the ranks of immortals. Now, with merits and virtues fulfilled, I wish to deliver over seven hundred names—men and women of this assembly—so their souls may ascend to the Realm of Non-Action, their wheel of rebirth unbroken.\n\nYet if any harbor deceit within while feigning purity without, forsaking righteousness and forgetting gratitude, corrupting customs and undermining teachings, scorning the Three Treasures and neglecting the Five Constants—how could such people escape karmic retribution?\n\nSome, once poor and later wealthy, now shamefully conceal their past.\nOthers, once rich and later poor, now resent their forebears.\nAs for their ancestors, their clans, their fathers, their mothers, their uncles, their elder brothers, their wives, their husbands, their younger sisters, their sisters-in-law—abandoning mourning rites, treating kin like strangers, as if deaf and blind. Worse still, they share no more care than horses and oxen, utterly devoid of sorrow, content to herd with deer and swine. Thus, the Yang and Ruo’ao clans, left with no lineage to rely upon—do they not feel shame before the sons of horse-doctors and field laborers?\n\nOnly I open the gate of expedient means, establishing for you this assembly of equality.

      "translated_text": "Let those already born and yet unborn never forsake compassion, adapting to circumstances and responding to transformations. Let those with kin and without, with equal loving-kindness, turn strangers into family, together attending the feast, ascending as one into the Dharma-realm. May your hearts open to awakening, free from greed, anger, and delusion. Let the Dao harmonize with nature, guiding all—from ghostly realms and human paths—back to the immortal Way. These words are no falsehood; do not treat them as mere commonplace.\n\n**Notice of Appointment to the Hall of Masters**\nWith reverence serve the Dao, ever mindful of the solemnity of fasting, purification, and ablution. Let those who lead by virtue be your teachers, each fulfilling their duties in conduct and demeanor. Vast and ever-present, majestic in spirit—though unseen and unheard, beyond naming or discussion. Be earnest in devotion, respectful in chaos, ever vigilant in your actions. According to the golden registers and their jade precepts, the system of ranks and duties comprises six disciplines. The three grades of examination you know well; let sincerity be your measure. As one asks the servant about plowing, consult the maidservant on matters of knowledge. No bribes shall suffice—only those of proven ability share the carriage, only the worthy the same boat. Attend to your duties, uphold your stations.\n\nThis is addressed to you all—such is your own cultivation. You must refine your bearing to inspire admiration. Those who heed this shall enjoy blessings; those who hear it shall ascend [to higher realms]. Let unity of virtue prevail; even a single lapse cannot be tolerated. Should any transgression arise, the responsibility for correction rests with all—three admonitions followed by three bows. Reverently observe the prohibitions, receive the registers, and restore the images. Sever wrongdoing, continue merit—neither reward too lightly nor punish too severely. Do not fret over undeserved gains, nor claim unearned success. As the saying goes: \"Without forethought, it begins with you, and returns to you.\" Merit and virtue are of utmost weight—here they begin, here they end.\n\nLet all who hear this take heed and comply in body and spirit.\n\n**Notice**\nThe establishment of teachings and statutes serves as guidance for all. In this world, offices and duties rely on those of trusted heart. Though we appoint from among the known, true talent must first be tested. Gather all without discrimination—cast aside neither a copper coin nor an inch of iron, nor neglect the worthy. Banish the wicked as one wields a sharp plowshare; recognize the dullness of a leaden blade. The six offices and six duties demand unity of heart and purpose. Let no past grudges linger, nor old missteps be repeated. Who is without fault? Yet those who correct their errors are true. The state upholds justice, even as it allows redemption. Ever vigilant, ever consistent—depart with announcement, return with report, as dutiful as to one’s parents. Report by merit, test by word, for the proper order of ruler and subject is thus.\n\n**Proclamation for the Yellow Register Universal Salvation Retreat**\nVast and unfathomable—such is the sage, such is the divine. Radiant and manifest, ever present to left and right. Uprightness is their virtue; salvation their work. Looking up, we revere the boundless compassion of the Most High; looking down, we heed the decrees of our office. With utmost solemnity, we undertake this great endeavor as witness.\n\nLong have we gazed upon the walls of Confucius’ temple; now we borrow the mat of Chen Fan. The spirits declare their return, wishing to enter the gate of cultivation. The retreat orders them; special mats are prepared. Let their faces bear joy, not the distress of the oppressed. Summon them, and they come—let them advance in succession, filling the hall to its narrowest corners. Welcome the familiar as old friends, the new as if long known—this is a once-in-a-millennium gathering. Let the distant come, the near rejoice; why distinguish between this realm and that? Some discuss the seasons’ cold and warmth, others the bonds of kinship—laughter fills the hall, hands join in song. What are ghosts, if not kin? All are human here.\n\nSpread the mat and share the meal; coarse grain is no shame. If private devotions to the Buddha arise, let them be conveyed. Should one not know where to dwell, is that not neglect of their abode? Choose guests with courtesy, deeply grateful for the love of the host, the Sage of the Eastern Way. Those souls selected for salvation shall together journey to the Western Kingdom of Vaisravana.\n\n**Notice for the Altar Wardens**\nProstrate before the three tiers, symbolizing the Three Powers, ascending and descending with solemnity. The eight directions correspond to the eight trigrams, arranged with strict precision. Stars form the weft, constellations the warp; heaven has its gates, earth its doors. Crimson cords stretch seventy-two zhang, charting the lunar cycles’ flow. Eighty-one poles are gathered, uniting the transformations of yang’s mysteries. The characters on the banner are as large as bushels; the floating canopy’s structure rises like a chamber. Light pierces the gates of heaven; incense strikes the pillars, filling the air with fragrance. Thunder Lords drive back intruders; Wind Lords wield their mighty fans. The gods, silent and steadfast, uphold the tilting; the Emperor, vast and majestic, presides above.\n\nShould any demonic forces—be they *kuí*, *xū*, *yù*, or *kuáng*, or the malevolent *chīmèi wǎngliǎng*—dare to act with deceit or spread filth, they shall be met with the unyielding law of the Mysterious and unforgiven. Like shadows caught, voices seized—let them be snared as in a net that leaves no rabbit free. Sever their forms, cut off their heads as an axe levels a wasp’s waist. Exterminate their leaders, root out their followers without mercy. Let the frost’s night be as still as withered orchids; let no wildfire rage to consume both thistle and lingzhi. Transform sand and gravel into southern gold, turn tiles and stones into harmonious jade. In the center of the sacred scriptures’ target, let no beast remain unscathed.\n\nYet how could the gods of the altar, who pluck cicadas with ease, deem their arts too meager? Those with office and duty, with the weight of words, must hold no bias, no private grudges. Guard the Dao with severity, manifest the altar’s clarity. Let ghosts be ominous, immortals auspicious—so it is said of the desire-realm’s flight through the void. Let heaven be free of haze, earth of dust, as we raise the hidden words of the Great Brahma.\n\nIn conducting the retreat and practicing the Dao, boundless merit is accrued. Saving the living, delivering the dead—this is the great affinity. Let all faithful men and women attending the assembly offer utmost reverence and devotion. Should any willfully violate the retreat’s precepts or transgress its prohibitions, they bring calamity upon themselves.",

Reverent indeed!\n\n**Proclamation to the Generals and Officers of the Altar:**\n\nWe have heard that the merit of courtly worship, traced to its origin, began with Attendant Kang of the Capital Bureau. Through such acts, one repays the toil and kindness of parents, thereby attaining the Dao—such filial piety and righteousness defy full expression. Later generations established rites for the living and the dead based on this precedent, and when examining merits, none surpass this as the foremost principle.\n\nMoreover, every person possesses understanding: who is without parents, without uncles and aunts, without siblings, without spouse, without children or nephews? Who does not hold their own body and limbs in highest regard? The living all wish to fulfill their natural lifespan without harm, while the dead all long to return to life, for dry bones to rise as flesh. Without this merit, none can be delivered.\n\nToday, on behalf of [Name] and the assembly, we conclude the retreat. Previously, on the journey of courtly worship, we prepared the yellow registers and petition slips to deliver both the living and the dead. The night-long fast and rite were held to cultivate and exalt this merit. The details are manifold, and without you, Generals and Officers, who would bear witness? Without you, who would transmit the talismans and circulate the decrees? Without you, who would present the memorials and convey the petitions? Without you, who would summon the wandering souls and restore the scattered spirits?\n\nYou, Generals and Masters, stationed before the altar—if they serve as the charioteer, then you are the left; if you serve as the charioteer, then they are the right. Equal in merit, one in body, each must attend to your duties with reverence. Boast not of your goodness, nor claim undue labor. Let the living each fulfill their lives, ascending together to the realm of benevolence and longevity; let the dead each find their rest, wandering together in the heavens of bliss. Both living and dead receive this grace, and all will raise their hands to their brows, declaring: “This is the merit of you, Generals and Officers!”\n\nOn the day your merit is recognized, your names shall be inscribed in the Upper Clarity. These are the secret words of the Most High—there is no falsehood in them.\n\nShould there be those who are inauspicious, disobedient, reckless, irreverent, unrighteous, treacherous, or deceitful—who willfully violate these precepts, defiling virtue until their transgressions reach Heaven—you shall, in accordance with the Mysterious Law, utterly eradicate them without exception.\n\nThus, exhort yourselves, Generals and Officers!

All proclamations to be issued shall proceed as follows.\n\nProstrate, we acknowledge that the Dao abides in the Great Void, formless and ineffable. Yet when summoned from one’s own primordial destiny, it arrives without delay. The Perfected Ones enforce prohibitions—without proper ritual, it will not act. The talismans of the Numinous Treasure universally proclaim the Nine Heavens. The Primordial Beginning’s *Red Writ* unfolds its myriad regulations. It spreads the five qi of the Five Dragon Divine Waters, coalescing them into numinous power. Wind gathers and smoke summons the Four Spirit Fire-Horses from the four directions, arriving like fine rain or dense mist.\n\nCity Gods, attend in reverence: I command the Demon Kings to guard my chariot, raising the Great Unity’s mighty standard and brandishing spears at the Fiery Gate. Let the *xi* and *wangliang* lurk in concealment; let the *chimei*, *shaokui*, and *xuyu* be swept away, and the mad *xuyu* subdued. The maidens of Wu Gorge shall find no place to cast their covetous gazes. The followers of Chiyou shall ultimately be reduced to withered bones.\n\nTo all assembled: heed this proclamation, and do not invite defilement to entangle you in guilt. Should any act thus, none shall escape destruction. Reflect thrice—though repentance may come, what use is it then? Uphold the Mysterious Law, and consign the wicked to the crooked and perverse. Sever heads and dismember forms, all to be boiled like dragons. Seize by sound and shadow—none shall slip through the net. Those who hear this tremble in terror; those who see it quake in submission.\n\nTo break one’s word is to forsake trust; guard the Dao with severity. Let the Ten Mysteries unfurl and the Eight Effulgences shine forth. May the Three Realms assemble in unison, and the host of Perfected Ones oversee the deliverance. Strike left to the left, strike right to the right. You shall serve as Upright Generals of Dharma Protection.

All eyes behold them with astonishment, for their solitary traces seldom stir such wonder. Though they attend to their duties with diligence, their merit must be weighed by the sincerity of their own hearts. Ten eyes gaze upon them, ten hands point toward them—none can escape the impartial judgment of right and wrong, good and evil.\n\nTo walk alone is difficult; to clap with a single hand is impossible. They must rely upon the strategies of civil and martial deployment. Next, to all the generals and officials arrayed around them—radiant to left and right, resplendent in might and spirit—who emerge from being and vanish into non-being, who appear before the eyes only to suddenly linger behind, whose past glory is recorded in the annals of history and whose literary brilliance is still heard today: now, their heroic souls exhaust their utmost loyalty, upon which Heaven and Earth depend for their very standing.\n\nWhen the talisman arrives, receive its command in silence.

      "translated_text": "In reverence, we acknowledge the vastness of the Feathered Realm’s pool, spanning eighty-four thousand leagues—boundless, shoreless, without edge or bank. At the Assembly of Universal Light, the fifty-three buddhas, embodiments of great sagacity, great vows, great compassion, and great mercy, have expansively revealed the Dharma-gate of delivering the living and ferrying the dead. How could we fail to cultivate the karmic causes of past and future?\n\nWe humbly reflect: born as women in the world of Jambudvīpa, during the time of bearing sons and raising daughters, how could we avoid the defilements that foul heaven and earth? Unrepentant, we tread upon thin ice. Truly, we fear that on the day of Gengshen, our transgressions may be recklessly tallied. Beginning in the year of Guisi, we seek to absolve our faults—whether to repay a mother’s kindness, cultivate our own blessings, aspire to be born in the Pure Land, or prepare a bridge for others. Fortunate that the measure of merit has come full circle, we pray that both the living and the dead may benefit.\n\nOn the third day of the third lunar month, golden figures appeared in the auspicious meanders of the Qu River. Like the Buddha Śākyamuni, who manifested upon Vulture Peak to expound the Dharma and vow to deliver all beings, we now earnestly invite four or five virtuous masters to establish a night-long Daoist ritual. Before the Mirror of Karma, in the halls of King Yama, we wholeheartedly prostrate to the Master Who Saves from Suffering. Within the Alms Bowl Hermitage, beside the table of Rājagṛha, we bow in homage to the bodhisattva Maudgalyāyana.\n\nWe make offerings to the worthy sages of the ten directions, welcome the eight compassionate lords, and dedicate the merit to the assembly of holy beings. We traverse the heavens, earth, and watery underworld, clearing paths for all. Summoning the departed souls, we guide them to recognize the white clouds. With mantras, we offer sweet dew and food; with lotus lamps, we illuminate the ninety-nine layers of hell’s darkness; with orchid-scented waters, we wash clean the sixty-six joints, bringing cool purity.\n\nWe separately prepare a nighttime feast for King Yama of the Scorched Face, universally bestow alms upon the asuras and all beings, and broadly extend relief to the orphaned souls, the stagnant spirits, and those trapped in the five sufferings and three evil destinies. May all sentient beings attain perfect enlightenment. After receiving the precepts, they shall be granted certificates as proof.\n\nWe pray that the departed may wander the Western Regions, beholding Avalokiteśvara in the lapis lazuli gardens; that those who preemptively cultivate merit may live as steadfastly as Mount Tai, attending the Queen Mother’s banquet by the Kunming Pool. May the sun of the Buddha shine ever brighter, bringing joy to humans and gods.\n\n**Notice of the Establishment of the Blood Pool Ritual Altar**\n\nIn reverence, we call forth wandering souls and restore lost spirits—especially on the third day of the third lunar month, the anniversary of the first crossing at Sizhou. For the benefit of beings, the thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Avalokiteśvara manifests in boundless freedom, vowing to become the incarnation of the Savior from Suffering and the King of the Scorched Face.\n\nAll disciples of the buddhas, if you wish to know the causes of past lives, sit again, and I shall tell you: swallowing charcoal and blackening the body is folly, deceit. Offering uncut jade is sufficient—why go further? Those who gnashed their teeth to pieces did so to establish martial merit; those who swallowed their tongues to death did so in shame over state affairs. Though their names are recorded in history, indelible, they dared not harm the hair and skin bestowed by their parents.\n\nBy the Miluo River, the waters stretch dark and vast; on Mount Shouyang, the winds blow cold and fierce. Eight thousand *li* to Chaozhou, cast adrift in lands of miasmic mists and poisonous vapors. Nineteen years upon the sea, stifled beyond the northern snows and desert sands—buried grievances unvoiced, yet their integrity stood tall. The Earl of Lu appeared in a dream to King Zhao of Yan; the descendants of Panhu were named by Emperor Gaoxin. Lord Wei transformed into a crane; the virtuous sister became a cat. Though they possessed human hearts, they were not spared the destinies of beasts.\n\nFor me, girded with gold and robed in purple—what need had I for a bamboo bowl and gourd ladle, unable to bear such hardship? To hasten as a menial, to serve as another’s slave; to pore over classics and histories, to act as a scholar’s scribe—what difference lies between noble and base?\n\nTraveling at dusk through rain, at dawn through clouds, I recall the dreams of Wu Mountain. Greasing my chariot, feeding my horse, my soul follows the wanderings of Pan Valley. Upon the One-Sandal Ridge, lightly I tread—where do I go? Before the Jade Coffin Hall, proudly I stand—where do I turn? Buried alone by tigers, devoured by serpents, like the ghost of Ruo’ao, without refuge. The son of Yuling did not die—who was he, enduring suffering age after age? Now, dead at last, all forms are empty.\n\nEighty-four thousand kinds of creatures, wriggling and fluttering; three hundred sixty classes of beings, feathered, furred, scaled, and shelled. I have heard of the myna bird reciting the name of Amitābha Buddha; of the clam transformed into Avalokiteśvara. Sparrows gather to chant sutras; geese listen to the Dharma.\n\nTonight, the patrons of this ritual, led by so-and-so, have established a night-long Daoist ritual in the Hall of Remaining Blessings within the Eastern Palace of Spiritual Salvation. We separately prepare a measure of food and widely open the Dharma-gate. Whether sentient or insentient, what distinction is there between early and late awakening? Since you have come to attend, why ask further?",

Rare blossoms and sweet herbs bear names each distinct; numinous mushrooms and auspicious grasses defy all description of their forms. Those patterned in five colors are not few, nor are the nine-hued phoenixes with three feet. The tortoise called *Ben* lives yet a hundred years; jade hounds bay at night, golden cockerels herald the dawn. Cloud-wreathed mountains stretch boundless, rivers flow vast and deep. Though set within this very cosmos, it presents a scene of another kind—dim and distant, beyond all bounds, a primal heaven not yet divided, swirling in primordial chaos.\n\nOne might call oneself a man of Fuxi’s age, yet never suspect one has lived to the kalpa’s end. To be born here, to grow here—could one not rejoice? Could one not delight? You, departed spirits, who would inquire of that other world: I have heard the wondrous Dharma, and it may serve as a bridge to this place, a means to bind karmic ties with all beings. Thus we establish the Mysterious Capital Offering, the ritual precinct solemn and still in the boundless void. We open the summons to the Celestial Physicians, the divine tigers perform the lads’ dance. We enact the Hunyuan writ, repent toward the directions, receive precepts and transmit talismans. We make universal offerings to the Ten Kings, brightly repaying the Three Realms. We proclaim the image-texts, intone the scriptures. Lamp-light pierces the realm of darkness; the unhindered feast of measured food is universally bestowed. Bathed in the Flower Pool, we wash away the floating veils of past years. We open the roads of the underworld, and now discern today’s journey. Turn not back—step firmly forward. Five *zhang* below the earth, a pearl the size of a millet grain hangs in the empty mystery; nine gates open in the heavens, leading straight through the Great Floating Li Soil to the First Azure.

      "translated_text": "Holding fast the Golden Deity’s seasonal rites, the Lesser Howl enacts its authority. The Middle Prime is the time for reviewing the registers of life; the seventh day is the assembly for celebrating birth. According to the seasonal customs of Jing and Chu, this legacy endures—stirring the hearts of all beings as wind and landscape shift. Leaves fall in the courtyard: we sigh at the fleeting passage of days and months. The dew’s chill sobers the air: we lament our forms and shadows, mourning ourselves. What has gone cannot return; what has passed cannot be pursued. Were we to compose a \"Summons of the Soul\" in the manner of Song Yu, we fear the soul might not come when called. Were we to emulate Jia Yi’s \"Lament for the Dead,\" our sighs would be in vain, for none would understand us.\n\nNow, wishing to inquire into the methods of life, we first enter the Assembly of Universal Deliverance. The Most High possesses the scriptural hymns for rescuing the suffering and delivering the departed; the *Lingbao* holds the rites for reviving the dead and restoring the living. These are the essential ford for transcending the world—here one may seize the moment and awaken to the Dao.\n\nAt the outset, what is called \"life\"? What is called \"death\"? Yet at its ultimate, there is neither death nor life.\n\nNow, the patron of this fast, [Name], has conceived this aspiration and wishes to open the gate of expedient means. If you spirits possess awareness, you may tread the path of return. At the sight of Mount Xian’s weeping cliffs, your souls shall ascend here. The rightful community is restored, and no soul shall fail to descend. The feast of this fast transcends the dusty world: to the east lies the Wilds of No Purchase; to the west, the Land of Silence; to the south, the Courts of Kunlun; to the north, the Palace of Primordial Mystery. Yet all these lie but within the space of a single thought—go straight, and you reach the First Azure Heaven. Coming and going freely, unobstructed and unbounded, countless bodies gather, entering a millet-grain pearl suspended in the void. We summon the Five Directional Lads, who hold lotus blossoms to guide the way.\n\nLet this admonition be heard and known.\n\nThus the proclamation is posted.\n\nAfter the court’s dismissal, the notice is posted below the realm.\n\nLi, the Daoist officer, burns the memorial tablet—this is the occasion for Lady Zhang’s release from her cup. When the Merit Officer recites the scriptures, it becomes the path for none to transcend.\n\nRecords of events and transmissions of the numinous resound through past and present.\n\nAlas, you who dwell in the six dark passes of the underworld and the three wretched destinies of suffering! Through endless nights, you have not glimpsed the light of sun or moon; through kalpas of many lives, how could you know the misty radiance beyond the world?\n\nTonight, at this very hour, come hasten to the Dharma assembly. To the left and right, compose yourselves. Though there are distinctions of rank, there is no division of noble and base. From Yue in the south to the Hu in the north—why separate you as \"us\" and \"them\"? From dawn to dusk, what difference is there between new ghosts and old? Since we now share the bond of those who meet as friends by the roadside, there is no need to follow banners and divide into factions like cattle.\n\nI have true words—you should listen closely. Those who gather ferns for food—how do they compare to those who feast from the celestial kitchens? Those who stitch lotus leaves for clothing—how do they compare to those robed in cloud-silk? Though Su the Academician possessed talent, he still suffered hunger and cold. How could the aspirations of Wang the Top Graduate not lie in warmth and sustenance?\n\nNow, take this single drop of pure soul-water and transform it into the gate of sweet dew for the great thousandfold world.

Is it not because your hun and po have yet to find their home, and so such thoughts arise?\n\nOne sip of jade nectar stirs a hundred emotions; when the dark frost is pounded away, the cloud maiden appears. I ponder the intent of this verse—could it be that rich flavors fail to satisfy the mouth? Woven from mist and purple silk, the robe brings only toil without joy, the face left unadorned. I savor the meaning here—could it be that light warmth fails to comfort the body?\n\nThe affairs of celestial immortals I dare not discuss. As for the spirit way, it cannot but rely on mortals to act: offerings of grain must be made, silks and cloth must fill the sacrificial pits. Yet are these grain and silk truly what the spirits depend upon?\n\nThus Confucius said: *\"Eating coarse rice, drinking plain water, resting one’s arm as a pillow—joy lies therein.\"* Zilu said: *\"I wish for carriages and horses, light furs, to share them with friends until they wear out, without regret.\"* Mencius said: *\"With five mu of land, plant mulberry—those of fifty may wear silk.\"* Again he said: *\"With a hundred mu of fields, do not rob them of their seasons—an eight-member household may know no hunger.\"* These words of the great sages, inscribed in books, were set forth for humankind.\n\nThe starving man beneath the mulberry tree wished to become a warrior. The affection for the coarse robe nearly cost the master his life. Straw sandals and hempen cloth—how frugal! Lotus garments and chrysanthemum meals—how pure! For clothing and food are what all people depend upon; not a single day can they be lacking.\n\nHow bitter it is—endless sands without resentment, yet dim and desolate. Cast among blades and arrows, heaven and earth grow sorrowful. Bones become the soil of a foreign land; souls become ghosts of a neighboring realm. With no one to offer mourning or sacrifice, what is to be done?\n\nDuke Cheng of Wei dreamed of Kang Shu, who said: *\"They vie to take my offerings.\"* The ghosts of Ruo’ao, if not fed by sacrifices, will their fate not soon perish? And consider the mantis seizing the cicada, the hound Han Lu snatching the swift hare, the chicken pecking at insects, the hawk striking at mice and sparrows—all rush for food, harboring no malice. The golden-robed lord, the black-clad master, the loom weaving new brocade, the powder passed down from the Qin Terrace—though called unknowing, each still seeks honor and nobility.\n\nThe bee’s flower, the fly’s buzzing pipe, the mosquito’s drone, the louse’s gnawing, the ant’s devotion to the pot, the moth’s flight into the flame—born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation, all cling to life. There is no other reason: each values its own nature and life. Since you know your nature and life, why not turn your hearts toward the Dao?\n\nTonight, eat my dharma-food, wear my dharma-robes, heed my dharma-words. Let all lonely souls within the three thousand great thousandfold dharma-realms—whether with masters or without, with thought or without, with form or without, of the ten kinds—abandon all craving and attachment, cast aside all doubt and suspicion, dissolve the distinctions of self and other. Thus, thus, all shall be delivered, bound straight for the land of rebirth.\n\nRoam south to the wilds of Wangmai, rest north in the silent lands of Moyi, wander west into the dark realms of Xijia, pass east through the primordial radiance of Hongmeng.

      "translated_text": "**Proclamation for the Establishment of the Ullambana Assembly to the Lower Realms**\n\nDescendants of Lü give birth to sons, and sons in turn beget descendants—how dare they forget the nurturing grace of generation upon generation? Men become ghosts, and ghosts again become men, yet they cannot escape the suffering of endless cycles of rebirth. Of all meritorious deeds, none surpasses this.\n\nIn this world of three thousand realms, there are patrons—so-and-so and others—who, on this auspicious day of the Earth Official’s Great Amnesty, reverently establish the Assembly of the Heavenly Worthy in the Mystic Capital. Since they earnestly honor the departed and cherish the distant, how could they fail to extend this kindness to others? They summon all ten kinds of lonely souls to deliver them from every suffering and hardship. Though the cold are clothed and the hungry fed, why do they remain as fleeting as foam, as transient as rest? Why do they still come?\n\nLet each abide in their place. Do not rely on strength to bully the weak, nor raise the armies of Jin and Chu. Do not harbor grudges to seek revenge, nor nurse the hatreds of Wu and Yue. Do not treat fellow passengers as enemies, nor wield spears within your own home. Do not let two tigers fight where the terrain cannot sustain them, nor imitate insects that devour one another and bring ruin upon themselves. Rather than clinging to \"you are you and I am I,\" why not break down the fences between us all?\n\nWhen one speaks of form as non-form and emptiness as non-emptiness, the other shore is seen to be utterly free of wind and waves. Only filial children can bestow blessings upon all, and only the benevolent do not shrink from such offerings. Though this begins with us, how can we bear to leave you behind? In the realm of darkness, a single somersault will lift you to rise upon the Terrace of Fragrant Mist. Recognize the hundred-step stairway—step firmly upon it.\n\nFollow the Mystic Precepts and do not stray onto the path of delusion.\n\n**Proclamation to the Lower Realms**\n\nFor the living, food that pleases the mouth may be fine millet or coarse fodder; garments that adorn the body may be humble hemp or noble fox fur. None can do without these. But for ghosts—how can they partake?\n\nAlas, you foolish and bewildered beings, drifting through the four modes of birth! The six paths hear no sound, and without sound, there are no mouths—though food exists, how can you eat it? They see no form, and without form, there are no bodies—though clothing exists, how can you wear it? Why then do you suffer the torments of sinking and drowning? It all arises from the mind of craving and attachment.\n\nWhen the Duke of Jin took the voice of an ox, it was because sound implies a mouth, and a mouth seeks food. When Master Sheng transformed into a pig, it was because form implies a body, and a body clings to clothing. Pressed by hunger and cold, how can one attend to propriety and righteousness?\n\nNow that you have come here, what will you do? Do not wield a dull hammer to strike a sharp awl. Each person has their shortcomings—do not weary of old fists or sate yourself on poison. What do the noble contend over? Do not let Han Lu and Dong Guo dogs exhaust one another before you, nor let the yellow sparrow and mantis devour each other behind you.\n\nOnly when one is like Lu Kang and Yang Hu, who reconciled the enmity between Wu and Jin, or like You Yu and Zi□, who turned Hu and Yue into brothers, can you cast aside grudges. Why not stop your carriage, share a mat of grass, and walk together? Walk together, but let the elder go first.\n\nLet those who come, come; let those who go, go—each to their place of rebirth. I extend the kindness of warmth and fullness; you dispel the state of freezing and starvation. The divine lamps shine like the sun, their light witnessed by all in heaven. The Dharma-water rains down like a shower, its moisture universally bestowed upon the void. Cultivate these merits to build this bridge.\n\nTake each other by the hand and ascend the jade steps—whether to advance or linger, whether to hasten or delay. Inscribe your names in the Golden Register—who will be first, and who will follow? For now, act as the King of Equality and attend the Unobstructed Assembly.\n\nLet this proclamation be issued without clamor.\n\nThus posted.",

      "translated_text": "Amidst the boundless expanse of layered gates, in the endless night’s profound obscurity, before recounting the thousandfold vastness, let us first speak of the six realms’ boundless expanse. The Four Formless Realms remain formless, yet their emptiness is but delusion. The Three Realms’ sentient beings never escape illusion’s transformations. The oranges’ playful elephants—are they free from deceit’s guile? The lotus’s lingering rings—can they sever the longing of affection’s thoughts?\n\nAcross all dharma-realms, those called celestial immortals still possess human hearts—how much more so the spirits of the Dao. Ancient sites in mountains and rivers, sacred altars and spirit shrines: when bells resound and apes cry, the plain temple is revered above the Southern Marchmount. The stone engraved with the iron horse’s dream—did it not fulfill the \"Yellow Ox’s\" prophecy? Though called divine powers, they still crave blood offerings.\n\nAmong those with eyes and ears, who willingly lends their sight and hearing? Among those with mouths and bodies, who willingly endures hunger and cold? Do they not take each step in thought, free from desire? Those who returned jade to their lords—where is that jade now? Those who died presenting their kingdoms—how foolish were those kingdoms! The horse of Chaoyang would not advance, though eight thousand *li* lay ahead. The paper of the sea would not nurture, though nineteen years passed in reckoning. Spears were not yet rested when spears were lost; oars were not yet struck when oars vanished.\n\nThough souls and spirits do not rot like deadwood, fame and merit are but empty blossoms. Some care not for wealth and rank, some shut their ears to right and wrong—rinsing in streams, resting on stones, angling for the moon, plowing the clouds. The elixir crucible remains, yet its furnace smoke has turned to ash. The meditation cell endures, yet its skeletal image has crumbled to dust.\n\nThen there are the nine schools—physicians and diviners—and the hundred arts—actors and entertainers: those who mock dwarfs escape not Confucius’ condemnation; those who take sorcerers as omens avoid not Duke Mu’s folly. Risking life on perilous poles and leaping swords, gambling existence on danger. Divining with turtle shells and casting tiles—why not heed their own omens? Scheming with traps and snares—why rely on force? Competing for profit with brush and coin—how does it compare to boats and carts?\n\nThough born alike, who knows how death differs? Some face battle and sacrifice themselves for their country: tongues may sever, yet eyes still glare; entrails may be devoured, yet bodies do not yield. The flames on Yan Mountain blaze fiercely—not for one snake alone. The waters of Miluo River surge boundlessly—not to stand apart from the crowd. The crow, unaware of fleeing, met its minced fate here. Without distinguishing suspicion, this scale led to its boiling. Those who imitated the bear’s roar—had their plans exhausted. Those who captured snakes—few remained.\n\nWealth harms the self; boasting of gold’s abundance is vain. Beauty injures the body; the sorrow of moth-eyebrows is futile. All flows on thus—what words remain? Alas, you multitudes, failing to find your place of rebirth, why enter the realm of death without guilt?\n\nAs for those who gape awaiting food—shame on their bloated bellies. Those naked and bare—deeply ashamed of their tattered quilted robes. Mouths shrunken—worse than a crow’s peck. Necks elongated—nearly like a crane’s form. The women of Xia Mountain often awaken as apes. The villagers of Fu Village—how did they transform into tigers? Some born from wombs, eggs, moisture, or transformation; some clad in scales, armor, or feathers. Though lacking human hearts, they possess hearts turned toward the Dao—these are the ghostly and beastly realms.\n\nAll you named and nameless kinds, mastered and masterless souls—why have you come? There is reason. Do not let the low surpass the noble, the distant surpass the close. Do not let the strong bully the weak, the many oppress the solitary. Rather, like fish moistening one another with foam, do not imitate beasts that fight when cornered.\n\nThe Southern and Northern Seas—are their customs truly so different? The people of Qin and Yue—are their hearts not equally sorrowful? When punishments are discussed, even strangers meet as new friends. Act now as the King of Equality and attend the Universal Salvation Assembly. To be clothed and fed—is this not joy? To be joyful—is this not delight? To bathe virtue and cleanse the body—is this not purity? To advance—is this not progress? To ascend the Dao’s shore, to climb the immortal steps—these are no empty words. Each should listen carefully.\n\nThus posted.\n\n**Notice for Wandering Souls**\n\nWhat makes humans spiritually superior to all things? Knowing heaven and earth’s nurturing power, they must also feel the sorrow of frost and dew. How does creation bring forth all beings? Though it shows no favor in sun and moon’s illumination, can it lack the thunder’s wrathful might?\n\nToday, the Daoist Liang, in reverence, recalls his father’s labor in building the house, cherishes his grandfather’s sharing of sweetness, his grandmother’s nurturing kindness yet unrepayed, his great-uncle’s exhorting words not forgotten. Recently, at the White Water Plain, he consulted the Green Crow divination to arrange burial rites, expressing filial devotion and pledging posthumous cultivation to bestow blessings. Unforeseen, this day has come—fearing to betray that earlier vow, he respectfully chooses this season of orange and tangerine, offering simple sacrifices of grain and fruit.\n\nHe respectfully invites the officiating officials to array solemn dignity, first purifying the sacred altar, then summoning the underworld. As for the rebellious dogs, stubborn and fierce, harboring treacherous schemes, embodying inauspicious omens and malevolent hearts—those who stealthily spy on lofty walls like rats, or presumptuously peer at grand tunnels like mantises, unaware of departure or approach, as foolish as dull steeds—let the multitude’s wrath brook no tolerance. The divine might blazes forth; relying on the Mysterious Law, they are delivered to the Demon-Quelling Star.\n\nAs for the pitiable wandering souls, the forsaken lingering spirits—having come to this assembly, what will you do in this hall? Form joyful bonds; do not harbor notions of self and other. Past enmities—let them all be resolved. Today’s heartfelt words—let them be briefly exchanged. Whether once old friends or neighbors bound by trust, whether decaying with orchids or enduring like metal and stone—use this to plan for yourselves; I will not betray your hopes.",
      "overlap_context": "t witnessed by all in heaven. The Dharma-water rains down like a shower, its moisture universally bestowed upon the void. Cultivate these merits to build this bridge.\n\nTake each other by the hand and ascend the jade steps—whether to advance or linger, whether to hasten or delay. Inscribe your names in the Golden Register—who will be first, and who will follow? For now, act as the King of Equality and attend the Unobstructed Assembly.\n\nLet this proclamation be issued without clamor.\n\nThus posted.",

      "translated_text": "**Scroll Twelve of Xu Xian’s Literary Works**\n\n**Memorial for the Restoration of Lingji Palace**\nWe observe that the construction of this palace has proceeded for six years. Recently, the eastern pond has dried up entirely, no longer offering the joy of divine and mortal communion. The roof lacks over ten thousand tiles. Those near and far who seek the spirits’ favor have voiced no small distress—surely none lack the heart to give generously.\n\nWe recall that building a house takes three years, yet still invites the criticism of passersby. A mountain built to nine *ren* may yet be undone by a single basket’s shortfall. Our Perfected One is both enlightened and efficacious. Let all of like mind remain steadfast to the end as at the beginning. Though this palace nears completion, the eastern pond’s desiccation gives cause for concern, and the western inscription shames us with thoughts of leaking roofs.\n\nAll around, in the ten directions, are benefactors. Above, within three feet, divine presences watch over us. Do not say that sweet wine is not offered in thatched halls—after libations, perhaps cassia wood may yet mend the medicine chest. The sum still lacking is precisely what is needed. Thus, we make our plea.\n\nTo count grains of rice before cooking betrays the narrowness of our own vision. To donate a million in wealth reveals the heart of a true elder. Since this is a plea for divine favor, why not give with joy? Let none hesitate in their generosity.\n\n**Memorial for the Construction of the Divine Kitchen**\nLong has the stone statue of Xu stood as a folk shrine—what is this if not a thousand years of virtuous governance? When Magistrate Chen wished to oversee the local altar, he sought to etch his name for ten thousand generations. His intent was not in the butchery of offerings but in the solemnity of sacrifice.\n\nThe new temple stands grand, a majestic sight in the land. Yet the old kitchen, exposed to wind and rain, totters on four crumbling walls. Though rise and fall follow destiny, creation lies in human hands. Once, we built by the roadside; now, we raise beams with purpose. Through the counsel of the worthy, the divine kitchen is complete.\n\nHow splendid! How magnificent! Soon, its grandeur will be fully revealed. Here, the distant may drink; here, they may feast. Thus, the temple’s majesty shall be restored.\n\n**Memorial for the Construction of the Hall of Remnant Blessings**\nWe recall that the five aggregates are empty—who perceives the three thousand great worlds? All buddhas arise from the work of the mind. To accumulate goodness is to build the Hall of Remnant Blessings, exhorting others to do the same. This blessed land is a pure realm indeed.\n\nWe have seen that in the first year of the Xinglong era, this luminous pavilion was raised, yet it lacked the Zhongtong paper currency. Those who gave willingly found the Buddha’s witness. In this life, we forge karmic bonds for this life—even a single coin carries its own merit.\n\nAxes fell trees, saws shape them; tiles must be broken, walls painted. Through diligent effort, we await the day bricks are polished into mirrors. With this humble memorial, we knock upon the gates of the noble.\n\n**Memorial for the Construction of the Hall of Remnant Blessings, Requesting Monks as Fundraisers**\nWe recall the thousand hundred million transformation bodies, each dust-mote realm attaining buddhahood. In the ten directions, every land is a bodhimandala. Do not dismiss what is seen as weightier than what is heard—one must act here to achieve there. All beings may be liberated, yet one must not forget one’s native soil.\n\nOur great master was once the monk of Ao Peak. The Hall of Remnant Blessings has long held the incense of Hu Rock—whether form or formless, it meets the conditions for enlightenment. Through exhortation and alms-seeking, we have gained the aid of celestial musicians.\n\nHaving already hung lamps and tempered the arm, why shrink from cutting flesh or offering the body? Let us repair the eastern wall and western wall, lest wind and rain intrude. The scale shall be grand, the renewal complete. From beginning to end, it shall be a boundless field of merit.\n\nHenceforth, let this karmic bond be fulfilled.\n\n**Memorial for the Construction of the Hall of Remnant Blessings**\nWe recall the alms-seeking across the ten directions—from the southern continent to the northern, years of cultivation. From the eastern land to the western, all are seeds of the Buddha. Do not bark at the old bhikṣu for finding it hard to beg—know that resolve makes deeds easy.\n\nThe elder scatters gold, known as the great *āraṇya*. The Hall of Accumulated Goodness and the Hall of Remnant Blessings are the bodhimandala of Dingguang Yuan. We must establish present and future causes and effects. From this point onward, renewal is our aim.\n\nVows as deep as cranes’ crowns and reeds’ knees. Beams like phoenixes, eaves like halos—how grand the scale! Thirty thousand loads of earth, great the expense. Thousands of donors, vast the merit.\n\nMany have cast forth their treasures, bursting the bag of illusions. No longer shaken by wind and rain, even dragons and devas praise this work. With this humble memorial, we knock upon the gates of the noble, awakening the bodhi-mind—great compassion, great joy, great giving. Countless are the marks of virtue and fortune, boundless and immeasurable.\n\nFrom beginning to end, may it be completed. With raised hands and lifted brows, we shall gaze upon it in reverence.\n\n**Memorial for the Restoration of Ciji Palace**\nWe recall the stored essence of the Bohai Sea, manifesting the thirty-two marks of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva. In Tongcheng, the incense of Ciji has burned for over two hundred years. Wherever it is established, the name remains the same.\n\nThis hall, now ruined and fallen—is its restoration in earth and timber difficult or easy? We look to the thousand benefactors for witness. Let not the mendicant’s vows be in vain; even a single tile or beam’s aid is welcome.\n\nFortunately, there is no division between this and that realm—let us forge bonds with ten thousand people. Meeting from a thousand *li*, let all give with joy, and it shall be completed this very day.\n\nPhoenixes soar, halos fly—how grand the scale shall be! Cocks crow, dogs bark—may the teachings spread far and wide. This is the transformation of black cloth into silk, the return of auspicious omens once lost.\n\nThrough this offering, may it serve as a bridge across the sea of suffering. The merit is beyond measure, the karmic fruit beyond thought. Gold scattered upon the earth—we have heard of Sudatta’s path to buddhahood. Incense burned to heaven—may we emulate the blessings Hua Feng offered to the sage.\n\nWith this humble memorial, we knock upon the gates of the noble.\n\n**Memorial for the Reconstruction of Wenxing Hermitage, Including Fundraising and Poetry Competitions**\nWe recall that Wenxing Hermitage plans to raise beams—its rise and fall are fated. A thatched hall cannot be a painted cake; without the right people, nothing can be achieved.",

Say not that this second coming costs no coin.\n\nWhat is right today may have been wrong before—yet once a matter has passed, let no blame remain. Neither ill-willed nor unkind, may we meet anew as if for the first time. No empty promises shall be made; only progress sought.\n\n**Memorial for the Restoration of Qilong Temple at Aofeng**\nWe recall that Qilong Mountain, where banners flutter, holds a true dragon’s lair—its paths winding, peaks circling. To fish from the turtle’s head, one must first claim its crown; where earth is sacred, men are noble.\n\nThough the grove lies shadowed, an ancient temple stands solemn still. For generations, this land has known blood offerings and incense smoke. Yet long has it lain in ruin—its rise and fall fated. Now, renewal is our aim, the divination auspicious.\n\nPhoenixes take flight in radiant splendor, yet we seek no excess. Cocks crow, dogs bark—we glimpse the signs of peace. Gods and men rejoice alike; village and shrine rest in harmony.\n\nPlans are made in unison, but strength must be shared. To raise even a single beam is no task for one timber alone.

To cultivate good roots is to honor good fruits; such is the principle we follow.\n\nNot for fame or profit, but to seize the moment.

      "translated_text": "Here is the translation:\n\n---\n\nPresent matters are neither false nor deceitful. Wealth in the world is ever in use and ever abundant. A thousand-character text bears a thousand-character mark—mutual agreement binds all. Among ten thousand people, ten thousand connections are made, and merit is fulfilled.\n\nCasual village speech may stir the hearts of the young.\n\n**Memorial for Road Repairs**\nWe recall the post road where travelers come and go, this thoroughfare spanning ten thousand li. The pagoda and bridge stand but a short distance apart, yet they mark the vital junction between two villages. Recently, floodwaters have risen, turning level paths perilous. Though all wish to do good, none can act alone. If we do not plan now, fertile fields may once more become seas—accumulation begins with small steps. Stone upon stone can form a mountain. In this time of peace, why refuse the passing note?\n\nThanks to the building of dikes, no detours will be needed. By joining in collective causes, we mend this shared ground. A steady step forward—this is the first stage on the road to the capital.\n\n**Memorial for Dike Repairs**\nWe recall that where water has embankments, floods cause no harm. Where fields know neither drought nor deluge, abundant harvests may be expected—though mountains and valleys shift over time. Years have passed, and the balance of yin and yang has faltered, leaving many lingering ills.\n\nNow we propose to rebuild the dike, restoring the old watercourse. Ten thousand oxen may haul the stone, but only thus can the waters be held back. Baskets of earth piled high will form a barrier strong enough to defend. Though we follow the land’s contours with wisdom, we must also contribute wealth and labor.\n\nLet neither landlord nor tenant make distinctions—together, we secure blessings for generations to come. We humbly request your brush to set these words to paper, that contributions may rise like clouds.\n\nWhat flows east must first flow west. What is done above will be mirrored below. To channel the Jing into the Wei, one must not shirk labor. To dredge the Huai and clear the Si, there is indeed a Way. Success is certain—granaries will overflow, and storehouses brim. The blessings are many: first wealth, then longevity.\n\n**Memorial for Establishing a Merit-Gathering Ritual**\nWe recall that in the great Ming, under Heaven’s mandate, all who accumulate goodness receive the five blessings of peace. Now, in this age of prosperity, in towns and villages alike, let us together achieve good karma, each awakening to the task.\n\nNobles and commoners alike, we humbly request your great brushes. May abundant virtue and power be bestowed. As the people observe the three-month repentance rituals, may four seasons of fortune gather—may the aged flourish, may all prosper.\n\n**Memorial for Prayers and Exorcism**\nWe recall that when baleful qi recedes and auspicious qi harmonizes, disaster is averted and hardship resolved. The Dao of Heaven is distant, but the Dao of humanity is near—thus we seek favor through offerings.\n\nFor the moment a thought arises, the gods take note—yet how can deeds be without consequence? The finest incense is not native to this soil. Wax candles and bright lamps may borrow light from neighbors. Let us uphold the peace of our village and hear the music of a well-ordered age.\n\nTherefore, the noble-minded anticipate misfortune and take precautions. Do not dismiss minor ills as harmless—pray for their removal. In us lies hidden virtue from Heaven.\n\nWe pray that the sounds of crowing roosters and barking dogs reach all four borders, that the blessings of the *Hongfan* and *Guizhou* be bestowed upon the people. How could there not be ample grace?\n\nIf goodness exists but is not acted upon, what use is it?\n\n**Memorial for Celebrating the Five Manifestations and the Buddha’s Birthday**\nWe recall that when a single Buddha appears in the world, all generations revere him. The three realms, filled with spirits, gather for the assembly of the Five Perfections. Ten thousand gods rejoice, and the four seas look to him in reverence.\n\nWe honor the Buddha’s station: through three asaṃkhyeya kalpas, he cultivated merit across ten lifetimes. On the eighth day of the fourth month, the *mingyú* plant blooms with auspiciousness, bestowing blessings from the nine heavens. Once more, the *udumbara* flower appears in splendor. With hands raised to heaven and earth, he vowed to deliver both saints and mortals.\n\nWe, your humble servants, owe boundless gratitude, for we know the source of our blessings. Whether registered households or water-dwellers, though the six senses and six desires remain unmastered, once a year we offer thanks. We prepare pure offerings, invite the World-Honored One, and bear witness together in awakening.\n\nWe pray that the Tathāgata may manifest—neither defiled nor pure, neither extinguished nor born. May all blessings reach the people—may they live long, prosper, flourish, and thrive.\n\n**Memorial for the Blood Bowl Ritual**\nWe recall that women, with their five leakages, endure hardship in bearing and raising children. A mother’s tenfold kindness cannot be repaid, even if one were to grind one’s bones to dust. Some mothers are still living yet lack proper care; others have passed, their merits unfulfilled. How can we not reflect on this? Let us return to the root.\n\nAs children, we must recognize the bonds of heaven and earth. By the true person’s wisdom and the Supreme’s expedient means, we establish the Blood Bowl Assembly. Following the repentance rites, we perform the twofold ritual—benefiting both the living and the departed, broadly delivering all beings.\n\nThe Savior from Suffering, the Heavenly Worthy, is none other than the compassionate patron. Do not dismiss this as unrelated to monks and Daoists. The Tathāgata Śākyamuni declared himself the reincarnation of Laozi—his merits are inconceivable.\n\nThere is no evil in that realm, nor weariness in this. Without concern for gain or accomplishment, we build this bridge, that all may cross and receive its seal as proof. May all turn in reverence, and may every assembly be complete.\n\nFrom the Floating Black Soil emerges a pearl of millet, no farther than five *zhang* away. The Feathered State’s pond transforms into a lotus throne, ever present within the heart’s square inch.\n\nTo express sincerity, we humbly submit this account.\n\n**Memorial for the Daoist Master’s Enthronement in the Luo Tian Jiao Ritual**\nWe recall the imperial decree of jade, bestowing honor upon the master. Two silver seals—what joy to receive such imperial favor! Never before has this been seen; today, we witness it.\n\nThough will can pierce stone, the body feels light while the feet grow heavy. Reborn, one is not worth half a coin. Yet we hear that good deeds multiply—why not pray for blessings like those of the Kaiyuan era, when bells were cast?",

      "translated_text": "**A Letter to Lord Dongcun**\n\nThe gods manifest their presence, proclaiming themselves through writings. Yet I, unworthy, cannot compose verses like those for the zither-playing spirit of Xiang, nor dare I presume to expound on the *Yi* as one buried in a tomb. My leaky roof brings shame, and my well-bound view leaves me ignorant. Though I may possess a single scrap of foolish insight, it remains beneath even the lowest of the Three Histories. Now, having been judged in the monthly critiques, I pray you will not fault me as the *Spring and Autumn* does.\n\nThe illustrious title of Lingji has endured over four hundred years, its transmission long unbroken. Master Tongzhen underwent ninety-four transformations—who dares claim to understand them? Though fame and profit may differ, literary merit naturally invites public consensus. It is only because Heaven does not withhold the Dao and Earth does not hoard its treasures that the Yellow River yields its chart and the Luo River its writings. Knowing the gods’ designs, one acts upon the slightest sign. The sage does not speak of the uncanny, and the nobleman harbors no doubt. Seen, it is invisible; heard, it is silent—without sound or scent. Vast beyond containment, minute beyond division, it transforms and thus endures. In essence, the upright depend on humanity, while fortune and misfortune, regret and shame lie as plain as the palm. The ancients were swayed by the winds, yet they were people of harmony and humility. In this degenerate age, where are the gentlemen of ritual, righteousness, integrity, and shame? This too is the concern of those who grieve for the Dao—how could I be merely playing with words?\n\nSince the matter is just, why seek others? Empty words are no match for practicing the Dao. To sacrifice to what is not a ghost is flattery; to fulfill one’s intent without self-deception is true sincerity.\n\nI reverently consider your esteemed self, who unites the manifest and the hidden, delving into the profound and the obscure. Your towering presence stands like a thousand-fathom cliff; your vast qi sweeps away armies with a brushstroke. Long have I admired the talents of the Prince of Teng, and now I rashly replace the request for the Luo Chi Stele with this plea, fearing even Bo Jie might pale in comparison. Fortunately, like Su Zizhan, I dare not refuse outright. Relying on your magnanimity as an elder, I am honored by the elegant verses you bestowed upon my daughter and grandson. With the temple’s renovation, the inscribed stone shall be glorified, becoming a model for all ages and a crown for the four directions.\n\nWords cannot exhaust speech, nor speech exhaust meaning; I merely convey this sentiment in brief. Greatness is called sagely, and sageliness divine. One must repay virtue—pray refine my words, and do not leave them unpolished like a neglected wall.\n\n**A Petition from the Villagers to Lord Dongcun**\n\nThis ancient temple has gathered four hundred years of dust. Now, a new stele of one thousand and eighty characters stands, its grandeur resplendent. Though its prose may be heard, like the Dipper and the Literary Star, its influence does not extend far. A journey of a thousand *li* is still possible—how could I have imagined the separation of Shen and Shang, spanning years? Never did I expect today to renege on my earlier words. Once, I sent a cage of geese, not the brush of Wang Xizhi; now, I offer no roasted meat to summon the Master’s carriage. Without the medicine of your counsel, I can only grope blindly. Yet I trust in your lofty virtue, which does not forget friendship in poverty.\n\nYou have deigned to favor me with fine words, not dismissing the crude as one might reject blue paired with white. I am ashamed of my vulgar speech, which risks confusing purple with vermilion. Permit me to ask: how might I inscribe my gratitude upon the river of your kindness?\n\nI reverently consider your brilliance, which exhausts the workings of creation. Your learning spans heaven and humanity; your writings surge like vast waters, as profound as Han Yu and more majestic than Sima Qian of the Han. Your renown has long been established, and your accolades are many. The Old Man of Stone Islet is no debt collector, and the Woodcutter of the Mountains only knows how to recite poetry. Though you have bestowed the diligence of a letter, I cannot help but cherish the affection of the *tiepao*. If you show kindness to one like me, who would dare forget the source?\n\nI, a latecomer to learning, am ignorant, my childish mind and meager wit adrift in the illusory and indistinct, devoid of radiant and heroic talent. Yet I have already benefited from your nurturing breath and sheltered beneath your canopy. With respect, I arrange these wild geese in formation, reiterating my private plea. Dare I trouble your carriage to grant this heart a fraction of solace?\n\n**A Letter in Reply to Lord Dongcun**\n\nSome ask: The *Record of Lingji Wang* is the king’s own account. If the king has already recorded it, why does he still eagerly seek others? What is his intent?\n\nAmong all things between heaven and earth, none is more numinous than the dragon. Its breath transforms, its wonders unfathomable. Yet what it relies upon to manifest its divinity is the cloud. Without clouds, the dragon cannot display its numinous power. This is the meaning behind my request to you.\n\nWith respect, I write to express my gratitude.\n\nWhen Zhang Lu entered the pass, he was already dead. When Ying Hou was at home, Tao Zhu concealed himself. Though Fan Li changed his name repeatedly, his true visage remained that of Gao and Kui. I know not what books Qi studied, but Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang have transmitted this Dao since antiquity. In haste or turmoil, one must hold fast to it. The subtlest essence lies in grasping the mean—this is the heart behind bequeathing teachings to the world. One must fulfill the rites of honoring parents and serving superiors; for a thousand years, its wonders remain unfathomable. Ninety-four transformations may be heard of, but without form or sound, I dare not answer the questions of ghosts and spirits.\n\nTo take righteousness as profit is not the way of the bandit Zhi. Though I possess only mediocre talent, I harbor a lingering attachment. Though the Three Rivers do not respond, a single phrase suffices to convey understanding. Why have you come? There is a reason.\n\nOne chaste woman shames the wanton crowd; one capped man humbles the topknotted nine. Though this is the way of the world, does it still possess humaneness? Not illuminating the *Great Learning*’s generation of wealth brings deep disgrace to the *Spring and Autumn*’s forthright brush. In this age, who but you could shoulder this task?\n\nThough one may not be human, humanity is not heaven. One must act in accordance with words, and speak in accordance with deeds.\n\nI reverently consider Lord Dongcun, whose virtue bridges the hidden and the manifest, whose Dao spans the obscure and the luminous.

      "translated_text": "A single word carries weight, upheld by the consensus of many. Why seek outward traces when this is already a matter of subtle influence?\n\nLord Beishan has sons, grandsons, and generations beyond. —*Postscript by Lord Xiecun*\n\nI am honored by your fine composition, which brings radiance to our ancestral shrine. Reading it again and again, I am suddenly struck with insight. Truly, this is what is meant by \"whether wise or unwise, the difference is as great as thirty *li*.\" If I were to compare myself to Master Tongchuan, that would be beyond my daring. Yet I shall place your *Dao Inscription* by my seat, so that future visitors to this hall may read these words, envision your person, and—like seeing a tiger’s pelt—know the roar that once shook the mountain forests and made all beasts tremble.\n\n—*Letter from Lord Xiecun*\n\nRecalling the poems you sent in your sleeve, I remember our brief encounter, where I glimpsed but half your refined bearing. Now, entrusted with composing this record, I behold once more your extraordinary presence—fivefold in its brilliance. Though I long to sweep the path before your gate, I have not yet had the chance. To hold the whip as your attendant would be to gaze upon a towering mountain. My heart holds you in deepest esteem; to know you is to meet Jingzhou—just as I have always wished. Not to have encountered the Lord of Lu is simply fate.\n\nI reverently consider Your Honor, the Prefectural Judge, a man of our native district, advanced in years yet blessed with the vitality of Shao, his hidden virtues sustained by divine favor. His mastery of the classics and cultivation of conduct embody the legacy of the Duke of Zhou’s descendants. His wealth enriches the state, surpassing the achievements of Yan Ying and Guan Zhong. His learning and scholarship surpass others, while his official rank is but a secondary matter. Having found joy in the company of Lord Dongcun, why should he not also wander the wilds?\n\nI dare to bow in humble reverence, grateful to have found recognition in this day. The inscription for the shrine is elegant, its thousand words a testament to refinement. Already, it circulates among the people, its praise enduring for generations, all flowing from your breast. This is no mere carved dragon on paper; even my crude and rustic talent cannot grasp the force of your acclaim. The numinous responds, and the village shrine shines with splendor.\n\nA gentleman forgives others’ shortcomings; even the smallest gift carries weight, its intent as light as a goose feather yet spanning a thousand *li*. I humbly present this pair of carp as a token of my diligence. Your words are worth a thousand gold, and in return, I offer this white goose in gratitude. Deeply ashamed of my rough draft, I can only hope for your indulgence. I respectfully command my ink-brush scribe to gaze upon the thousand volumes of history.\n\n—*Letter on Behalf of the Local Community from Lord Xiecun*\n\nHan Zihua was praised by the Duke of Holding the State—this is the honor due a scholar-official of our time. Xie Lingyun never dreamed of Hui Lian; how then could he have composed those sublime lines by the pond? Where there is such a brother, there must be such a spirit. I revere the man, and thus I revere the deity.\n\nYou have deigned to lower yourself to one so unworthy, a great talent bestowing favor. Long have I cherished your humility and virtue, never daring to forget your kindness. All say that the elder brother’s judgment is sound, yet it is truly your guidance that steers us. After three years of offering, I lament my own inadequacy. Even a meager meal, once spoken of by you, gains weight. How dare I borrow a thousand gold? Yet your praise, like the words of a trusted friend, moves me deeply.\n\nI reflect that I have idled in my village, retreating to the mountains. Though poor, I have never changed my countenance. Wherever my gourd bowl has taken me, I have never presumptuously presented my name. Long have I basked in the lingering grace of your river’s bounty, bound as we are by the vines of kinship. Beyond this, I have no other requests, nor do I know what else to do.\n\nI reverently consider you, a man of renowned lineage, a rare talent of our age. Your breast brims with noble aspirations, your brush flows with vast and boundless prose. I am deeply ashamed that my humble gate cannot accommodate a carriage of four horses. I respectfully offer this letter with utmost reverence, though I am unworthy even of its paper and ink.\n\nYour many acts of kindness have long been known, and I have heard of your reputation as a military adjutant. The temple’s renewal is entirely due to the efforts of Governor Yu. This fulfills my wishes, and I offer these words in gratitude.\n\n—*Letter to Commander Zhang*\n\nI prostrate myself in awe, considering how your bold arguments in the court have secured a legacy for a thousand autumns, and how your strategies within the command tent have earned you the enfeoffment of ten thousand households. Your exemplary conduct endures, ensuring prosperity for generations to come. I dare to present my name, seeking an audience before the court. Your humble inquiries are without shame, and the songs of the people attest to your virtue.\n\nI reverently consider Your Honor, the Commander-in-Chief, whose *qi* is vast and unyielding, whose nature embraces benevolence. You govern the people with a parent’s heart and judge affairs with divine clarity. Grievances vanish like thorns cleared from the thicket, while virtuous deeds flourish like sweet pear trees. Your upright governance stands unmatched among the seven prefectures of southern Min. Your noble bearing soars above all, and all gaze upon you as the North Star among men.\n\nYour learning is as deep as the ocean, your scholarship as splendid as the blossoms of the literati. Your brush wields creation itself, conjuring wind and clouds upon the page. Long have I heard of the two peerless talents in your court, and I rejoice in this gathering of shared culture. Your legal acumen rivals that of Cui and Du, still praised to this day. Your critiques of Ou and Yu leave no room for reproach. The gates of your hundred-*li* city stand magnificent, and the thousand-year-old ornamental pillars are renewed.\n\nHow admirable! How excellent! I prostrate myself in reflection: I am but a child from a remote village, born in a thatched hut, yearning to behold the pure light of wind and moon, having once sat in the lingering glow of rivers and streams. Now, in this village of accumulated virtue, there stands an old rain-praying temple, repeatedly blessed with divine responses, known as the Spiritually Efficacious Shrine. Its characters are as large as pecks, boldly inscribed and doubly cherished. The inscription is on every tongue, and gratitude for your virtue must be sung anew. This is a grand affair for all time—who would dare to diminish its legacy?\n\nThese empty formalities in a wooden box are hardly worthy as gifts. May heaven bless and support you with abundant fortune, fulfilling the sincerity of my prayers. With humble shame and heartfelt gratitude, I offer these words.\n\n—*Letter Requesting an Inscription for the Temple Gate from the Surveillance Commissioner*\n\nThe arrival of your carriage in the eight prefectures brings added luster to this blessed land. The Surveillance Bureau, with its solemn governance, extends the protection of heaven itself. I am deeply moved and will never forget this kindness.\n\nI reverently consider Your Honor, the Surveillance Commissioner, a rare talent of our age, a great virtue for our time, whose nature is pure and conduct meticulous. Long has your family been renowned as upright officials in Chengdu. Your heart is upright and your intentions sincere, having personally received the teachings of Master Yichuan. Your lineage has long been praised for its purity, passing down exemplary conduct to your descendants. You uphold the customs of Guān and Luò, making ritual and righteousness the model for Ōu and Mǐn.\n\nYour calligraphy stands unmatched through the ages, your brushwork sweeping away a thousand armies. Lu, Luo, Wang, and Yang are hardly worth mentioning; Ōu, Yu, Chu, and Xue cannot compare.",

      "translated_text": "The writings of later masters that transform the present—those of Wang, Yang, Lu, and Luo—cannot surpass this. Ascending to transcendence and verifying sagehood, the teachings of Zheng, Qiao, Wo, and Quan—might one yet hear of them? With the heart set on carrying forth Heaven’s transformative work and the vow sworn to benefit beings and aid others, compassion manifests in myriad forms, and merits defy measure.\n\nThe rites of spring sacrifices endure in their observance, yet the duty of morning and evening devotions may lack its proper steward. Thus, through inertia, we have failed to seek out worthy ones. Who, dwelling alone, might deliberate on the Great Harmony? He who takes goodness as his teacher—such as you, sir, a man of aligned resolve and disciplined conduct—commands the collective plea of the multitude, not for my own sake or out of personal favor.\n\nShould you deign to grace us with your presence, the grandeur of the palace gates would shine all the brighter. Again, as iron is transmuted into gold, we rely deeply on your refining power; as a brick cast forth draws forth jade, we bear the weight of your parallel prose. In my recent memorial, I humbly presented a stern simplicity, my gaze fixed on the smallest details, and now, with reverence, I sweep clean my humble abode, awaiting your arrival with hands clasped, ready to receive your radiance with offerings of incense and flowers.\n\nA thousand-year-old marble pillar, home to the swift-returning crane of immortals. A ten-thousand-year Dao sanctuary, a land as majestic as the Six Turtles of antiquity. From all directions, the gaze of the world turns here; by the strength of the many, it is sustained. To manage it, to cultivate it—whose effort is this? From beginning to end, though it be my heart, it is the heart of the villagers. Yet I fear this flourishing may not long endure, and so, with earnest devotion, I make this plea.\n\nHuman sentiment is thorough: they say the plum blossoms by the stream are worth a thousand gold. To see this good work completed would surpass even the wealth of Yangzhou’s ten thousand taels. I humbly request that the High Master Tang Zong establish ten thousand assemblies to assess and honor this endeavor. As the assembly of gods and humans spreads its blessings, your name shall suddenly emerge, summoned forth. With respectful deference, I await your esteemed presence.\n\nI hold in deepest reverence so-and-so, a master whose learning flows from profound sources, whose Dao towers like a mountain peak. You grasp the subtlest mysteries of the profound and empty, embodying stillness and non-action. Your mind upholds the strictness of ritual purification, and your strength bolsters the gates of the teaching. From the first, I trusted in your conduct among men. In this age, who but you could lead?\n\nNow, for the sake of Lingji Palace, we propose a Universal Salvation Assembly, to be held on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, with a special ten-day observance. Three days of fasting will precede the nine-morning rites. Externally, the teachings will be expounded; internally, the *Scripture of Salvation* will be recited. I implore you to condescend to your exalted station and preside over the ritual proceedings. Should the souls of the departed find deliverance, this assembly will indeed be illuminated. Looking up, I rely on your wisdom; bowing low, I risk overstepping.\n\nI, dwelling in rustic obscurity, am but a latecomer—what do I know? Though the Dao may be beyond my hearing, the virtuous delight in doing good. Should you graciously descend from your carriage to take your seat, I shall sweep the mat to welcome you. A single boat can ferry one sixty *li*; I shall forever prepare incense for your long journey. Countless people turn to you in devotion—joining the multitude, I shall not be cast aside.\n\n---\n\nOn behalf of the villagers, I petition for the appointment of a lecturer to the capital:\n\nFor long have I admired your noble character, not merely for a day. Recently, in discussing the mysteries, I presumptuously knocked at the gate of your cinnabar chamber. You deigned to respond with humility, casting your gaze upon me. Since our parting, this sentiment has never waned.\n\nNow, for the construction of the ritual platform at Lingji Palace, I have conveyed this humble request, entreating you to condescend to travel here. When it comes to the literary style of canonical texts, you are the one the people have chosen. In this age of moral exemplars, who but you could lead? Should you apply the fasting rituals as your own practice, enabling our deities to merge with the likenesses of immortals, how profound would be the blessings bestowed!\n\nThe timber of the ridgepole and the pillars of the threshold are not your proper place. Like the vastness of rivers and seas, all streams—even the muddy and stagnant—find their way to you. Should you deign to descend to the altar, I shall hold the broom in readiness.\n\n---\n\nA petition for the appointment of Yue Shan as temple warden:\n\nI, who respond to circumstances to benefit beings, have yet to open the gate of skillful means. Pushing aside the grasses to seek the mysteries, I long to behold the depths of true emptiness. You have graciously taken notice of me, yet for long I have proffered my card in vain, blocked by the long barrier of the western gorge, gazing toward the northern mountains in yearning. Now, having received your command, how dare I not act as your humble disciple?\n\nThe divine and enlightened cannot be fathomed—this petty one shall do his best to respond. Were it not for the precepts of the Venerable Master Chonggui, how could Pang the Layman display his spiritual powers? The *Record of the Pavilion of Great Compassion* is now complete; I dare to reveal my Eastern Slope visage. The Dao sanctuary of Caoxi is no small matter—why not take up the Sixth Patriarch’s koan?\n\nWhy has the Venerable Master Chonglin come? The Old Man of the Stone Path will surely not cast me aside. Fearing that the golden root may be misaligned, I still seek the jade axe to refine it. Should you deign to take this as your topknot and robe, it would be like moving an old case to this neglected thatch. I offer but a cluster of gourds and a bolt of fine silk, a modest gift like the purple bamboo shoots of Huzhou.\n\nMay your Dharma eye open wide; my private sentiments need not be spoken.\n\n---\n\nA congratulatory address on the appointment of Lu Shan:\n\n...",

      "translated_text": "Humbly I recall how the Venerable Master of Guangshun once ascended the jade steps of the imperial court, and how the Xiantong Chan Monastery was graced with the honor of a golden edict and inscribed plaque. What has shone before must surely return in its beginning.\n\nWith reverence I consider the Venerable Master of White Deer: the world is drenched in his Dharma rain, the fragrance of compassion fills the rocky cliffs—truly a superior person, blessed with the marks of virtue and power. I look up in awe at the boundless imperial favor, and bow in respect at the proclamation of his appointment. Scaling the lofty peak, he climbs the clouded heavens of the ten thousand years; his voice resounds, \"Long live the Emperor!\" The great monastery adorns the blessed land of the Three Mountains. His renown weighs upon the Three Mountains, and with a shout he scatters the wild foxes beyond the fields. Joyfully encountering the pair of deer before the hall, the monastic groves stand in solemn order, and the neighboring villages gleam with splendor.\n\nI reflect that I, in my humble station, am without ability, though our bond has long been established. How dare I, with my insubstantial and empty words, venture to approach the wondrous workings of his spiritual powers? Though his name is inscribed upon the pagoda and his writings manifest in his deeds, yet in advancing step by step, his strength surpasses others. Since the Dharma’s cause is no mere accident, the Dao sanctuary will naturally flourish. I now offer my congratulations, never forsaking compassion. Having been graced by the honor of his elephant-borne visitation, I pray he may reveal the sacred auspice of the green waterfowl. For a thousand years, this temple must receive the Buddha’s confirmation. With a single wisp of heart’s incense, one ought to join palms in reverence.\n\nMy written words are few, but my devotion runs deep. I humbly present this verse:\n\nUpon the rain-drenched peak he sits,\nHis wondrous powers vast and deep.\nRejoicing in the weight of royal grace,\nHis name soars high o’er Ten-Thousand-Year Peak.\n\n*Postscript of Inquiry by Zhou Shenggong*\n\nThis Zhou Shenggong is the finest of our hometown—a true \"white eyebrow.\" The common saying goes, \"Scholars are often ill-fated,\" and indeed it rings true. His four-six parallel prose seeks some response, yet this is beyond even my three-fold experience; I can only reply with a few brief points.\n\nAll mountains, forests, rivers, valleys, and hills are called *shen*—spirits—yet the Three Offerings hold particular solemnity in the rites. When yin and yang, wind and rain, brightness and darkness lose their proper rhythm, the Six Excesses are already warned against in medical texts. Ashamed of my lack of the mountain spirit’s efficacy, I have instead invited the river demon’s mockery, left speechless and unable to defend myself. What transgression have I committed? One may discern the truth in the end, yet might not misfortune and fortune still confound?\n\nThe tortoise does not weary of me; I rely solely on the first divination’s omen. The horse cannot speak, yet I dare inscribe the words \"peace\" in seal script. The yellow bear appears in dreams—dreams born of thought. The red snake transforms into a shadow—yet even shadows may be doubted.",
      "overlap_context": "Stone Path will surely not cast me aside. Fearing that the golden root may be misaligned, I still seek the jade axe to refine it. Should you deign to take this as your topknot and robe, it would be like moving an old case to this neglected thatch.

      "translated_text": "Having consulted the oracle again and again, I glimpse at last the true circumstances. There comes a time when no medicine is needed—yet how can brush and ink suffice to record it? Your prayers have been long and earnest; what more could you say? Since your kindness has pressed me so, I cannot refuse.\n\nThough the broken-arm prophecy proved true, it did no harm to the benevolence of Yang Shu. Though the lost-axle kin were unharmed, it did not diminish the renown of Lou Shide. Twice have I sent letters of mourning, each time shamed by your commands. Though a gentleman may grieve in adversity, must he assume the guise of a petty man?\n\nIf Heaven does not summon me back, what can Bo Liao do against fate? For great renown must endure the trials of the altar’s pit, and dark spirits often rise in the wake of lingering illness. What crime has the crane committed? When will the phoenix’s forging be complete? Even a lame tortoise may yet take one more journey; the bedridden rooster can still reconnect. Yet I fear the mockery of “washing feet and losing wealth,” and dread the reproach of “extending a hand only to cast the next stone.”\n\nSince you have spoken to me so earnestly, I recall your footsteps with joy. To repay enmity with virtue—even the old fist finds no surfeit. Strive in learning and conduct, and may you never forget your former steps. To share another’s sorrows and rejoice in their joys—even Confucius and Mencius found this hard to articulate. To drown where others drown, to hunger where others hunger—this was the vow of Yu and Ji.\n\nTo skillfully save all things is to waste nothing. To speak when one can speak is to never misspeak. To seek a six-foot vine, one must first cultivate three-year mugwort.\n\nMy reply, written in haste, still harbors the fear of a bladder’s rupture. I would rush out in bare feet to welcome you, yet wait for your carriage’s arrival. I raise my whip in gratitude—why hesitate to follow in your steps?\n\n**Marriage Proposal for the White-Water Bridge Alliance**\nI recall that our two families, having borne sons as clever as paired fish, now unite for a second generation. The oracle confirms the harmony of the mating phoenix. The Zhus and Chens share an old bond; the Zhengs and Weis renew a long affection. We pledge by the green mountains and swear by the white waters. The karmic cause is now fulfilled—how fortunate we are!\n\nMoreover, your granddaughter’s virtue follows the legacy of her forebears, delighting in the zither’s charm like Bian of old. My grandson, raised on poetry and books, has yet to wield his brush to compose. Though this is a matter of kinship, why should age be a barrier? She may serve as Huang’s matchmaker, and all will call her the true wife of Liang.\n\nSpeak of love only when the time is right, offering fern and artemisia in dutiful service. As rites value simplicity, I humbly prepare hazelnuts and chestnuts to announce the betrothal. My modest gifts are listed on the right—with respect, I present this proposal for your consideration. May your esteemed kindness deign to reflect upon it.\n\n**Raising the Ridgepole Address**\nAs the Three Mountains converge, all proclaim this blessed land of great peace. From a single vein of lineage, the Dao’s gate follows the hidden path. Now, entrusted with the duty of the ancestral hall, we complete the work of building a home. The oracle and tortoise shell align with the auspicious hexagram; the people’s fondness for magpies and crows manifests as omens upon the roof.\n\nWith reverence, I consider [Name], who carries on the family legacy, his name sung in praise. In his hand, the jade tablet emerges from the brush’s artistry; in his heart, he holds the framework’s grand design. From a single household’s affairs, we rejoice in the splendor of the twin-petal tower. Sheltered within a hundred *li*, we celebrate the glory of the flowery county.\n\nOne day’s renewal brings ten thousand years of magnificence. As a humble craftsman, I dare not claim great wisdom. Following the given path, I plan and construct—how could I presume to saw or hew at will? In the marketplace of gold, they vie to boast of Fan Li’s wealth. Before the hall of colorful robes, I wish to emulate Lao Lai’s play.\n\nLet me offer the sparrow’s modest congratulations for the new hall, and ascend the rainbow’s high ridgepole. As the poem says:\n*Like you, the timber is fit for ridgepole and beam—*\n*Yet it still requires skillful carving.*\n*A great mansion shelters ten thousand, vast in its refuge,*\n*And in the courtyard, we rejoice in the triple sophora’s shade.*\n\n**End of Xu Xian’s Literary Anthology, Scroll Thirteen**\n**Xu Xian’s Literary Anthology, Scroll Fourteen**",

Vermilion Palace.\n\nThe three paths of suffering are liberated, transcending the three realms,\nEight-colored radiance illuminates the eight directions.\n\nHearing the scriptures and listening to the Dharma, together we arouse compassion,\nSharing food and clothing, all equally enjoy warmth and sustenance.",
