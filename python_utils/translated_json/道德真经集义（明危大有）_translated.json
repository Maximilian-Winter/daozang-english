  "full_translation": "**The *Zhenjing* of *Daode* with Collected Meanings**\n\n**Title:** *The Zhenjing of Daode with Collected Meanings*\nA compilation by Master Wēi Dàyǒu, in ten volumes.\nOriginal source: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dòngshén* (Cavernous Gods) section, *Yùjué* (Jade Precepts) category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Zhenjing of Daode***\n\nThe *Daode Jing*, both *Shang* (Upper) and *Xia* (Lower) chapters, comprises over five thousand words. Within it are encompassed the Dao of preserving and cultivating life’s essence, and without, the affairs of governance and harmonizing the world—none are omitted. This is the learning of *inner sage, outer king* (nèishèng wàiwáng).\n\nThe *Shǐ* (historians) placed it between *Shēn* and *Hán*, and the world thus came to call it the *Yellow Emperor’s Legalism*, which is vastly different from what the Daoist tradition truly holds—this cannot but be flawed.\n\nWhen the Zhou declined and the Way of the Sage waned, its intent to save the age and benefit the people was embedded within, yet it was not solely about self-cultivation. Cao Pǎn, Marquis Gāo, found that *clearing and stillness, non-action* bore fruit in governance, and his application was not far from the practical principles of the age. How much more so for the teachings of withdrawal from the world, which were thereby greatly expanded!\n\nSome, failing to grasp the profound origins of its meaning, dismiss it outright as empty, bizarre, and fanciful—how could such be true understanding of the Dao?\n\nOver a hundred schools of commentary and exegesis have emerged since antiquity, each holding to their own interpretations. Yet the finest are those whose words and logic are comprehensive and coherent; if meaning is obscured or reasoning flawed, even elegant phrasing is of no worth.\n\nMaster Wēi Dàyǒu of Xū River, upright and resolute in his purpose, examined the works of all schools, selecting the most excellent to compile into this collection. He sought to have it engraved and printed for transmission, his diligence commendable. If those who truly savor its meaning seek beyond the words and embody it in body and mind, then the Dao of preserving life’s essence will flourish within, and the affairs of governance and harmony will manifest without.\n\nIs the Dao divided? At his request, I thus presume to inscribe this preface.\n\nIn the year *Zhāoyáng*, the *wǔ* year of the *Dīng* cycle, on the *zhōu* day of the twelfth month, the 43rd-generation Celestial Master, Zhang Yǔchū, a disciple of the Three Caverns, respectfully composes this preface.\n\nThe *Daode Jing* is the ancestral scripture of our Dao. Its essence is *wuwei* (non-action, naturalness), its practice is *humility, retreat, kindness, and frugality*, and within it are all the methods for cultivation, governance, and harmonization—none are lacking.\n\nThe True Person Gé Xuān said: The five thousand words are the very source of *Daode*, encompassing all that is vast without exclusion, all that is minute without omission—the natural scripture of Heaven and humanity.\n\nMaster Ni Wénjié said: The five thousand words of Laozi are indeed the essential method for self-cultivation and governance, the finest remedy for saving the age and benefiting the world.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that it is not merely the ancestral scripture of the Dao—how could the scriptures of the Three Teachings (Daoism, Confucianism, Buddhism) possess any other principle apart from this?\n\nIn the present age of sage and enlightened rule, it is especially revered, and a Daoist Bureau has been established to oversee its teachings. Future scholars must first master its doctrines before receiving ordination certificates. Yet alas, the world is in decline, and even its reading is unknown—how much less its meaning?\n\nMaster Wēi Dàyǒu, during his leisure from ritual duties, compared the commentaries of various schools, which sometimes differed, sometimes aligned, with merits and flaws alike. Scholars could not help but be confused. Thus, he gathered the interpretations of *Hé Shànggōng* and *Hé Xīnshān* and over ten other schools, selecting those whose elucidations were detailed and clear, whose logic was sound and consistent without strain, compiling them into two volumes—*The Daode Jing with Collected Meanings*—so that future scholars might know the definitive interpretation and avoid confusion from conflicting views.\n\nAs for those who, through understanding the meaning, illuminate the scripture, and through the scripture, construct the Dao, finding joy in the practice of *wuwei*—such persons are not absent.\n\nIn the year *Dīngmǎo* of the *Hóngwǔ* era, Master Wēi Dàyǒu of Xū River, incense burning, respectfully records this.\n\n**Names of the Commentators in the *Collected Meanings***\n*Hé Shànggōng* (Riverbank Master), also known as *Hé Shàng Zhàngrén* (Riverbank Old Man).\n\n**Names of the Commentators in the *Collected Meanings* (Continued)**\n*Lǚ Zhī*, surname **Lǚ**, given name **Zhīcháng**.\n*Hé Zhī*, surname **Hé**, given name **Xīnshān**, courtesy name **Chǔyīn**.\n*Lǐ Zhī*, surname **Lǐ**, given name **Dàochún**, style **Qīng’ān**.\n*Liú Zhī*, surname **Liú**, given name **Shīlì**, style **Zhēnjìngzǐ**.\n*Ní Zhī*, surname **Ní**, given name **Sī**, style **Qízhāi**.\n*Lín Zhī*, surname **Lín**, given name **Xīyì**, style **Yǐzhāi**.\n*Sū Zhī*, surname **Sū**, given name **Zhé**, courtesy name **Zǐyóu**.\n*Dǒng Zhī*, surname **Dǒng**, given name **Sījìng**.\n*Cháo Zhī*, surname **Cháo**, given name **Jiǒng**.\n*Chái Zhī*, surname **Chái**, given name **Yuángāo**, courtesy name **Zhībái**.\n*Hào Zhī*, surname **Hào**, given name **Chéng**, style **Cǎolú**.\n\n---\n**The *Daode Jing with Collected Meanings* (Volume One)**\nCompiled by **Wēi Dàyǒu of Xū River**\n\n**Chapter One**\n*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.*\n*The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nThe named is the mother of all things.*\n\n**Commentary by Hé Zhī:**\nThe Dao is the primal *qi*, formless and void, a chaotic unity of nature. From it arise the two polarities (*èryī*), and all things derive their form. It cannot truly be named, yet we forcibly call it *Dao*. Thus, the opening line rightly begins with *Dao* alone, standing apart—just as in the passage *\"The Dao is boundless, yet it acts\"* (Chapter 4), where *Dao* is first proclaimed in reverence. By this, we see its supreme height and boundless greatness. Since the Dao establishes its name, both are declared together.\n\nThe lines *\"The Dao that can be spoken\"* and *\"The name that can be named\"* refer to the Dao’s methods being divided among the world, and names serving as their markers. *\"The eternal Dao and eternal name\"* speak of the void generating nature spontaneously, nature generating the Dao, and the ineffable beyond naming. If the Dao is truly eternal, then its name is eternal as well. What can be spoken and named are but temporary expressions. To say *\"can\"* implies both possibility and impossibility—how then can it be eternal? This is the paradox of forced naming. To say *\"eternal\"* denies both possibility and impossibility—how then can it change? This is the natural way of things.\n\nThe Dao is its essence; the name is its function. Both existence (*yǒu*) and nonexistence (*wú*) are names. The Dao originates in nonexistence—vast and empty—thus naming the beginning of Heaven and Earth. Things arise from existence—vibrant and flourishing—thus naming the mother of all things.\n\n**Commentary by Lǐ Zhī:**\nThe Dao is the void and natural, the eternal Way. Originally, it cannot be spoken of; the Dao that *can* be spoken is not the eternal Dao. The primal *qi* of origins transforms into all heavens, adapting to time and change. The Dao itself is formless; the names we give it are not its true names. Heaven and Earth move and transform, nurturing all things, manifesting in tangible forms and names.\n\n**Commentary by Lín Zhī:**\nThe Dao cannot be put into words. The moment speech is applied, it falls into the second order of meaning. Thus, one must observe it without desire to grasp its subtlety, and with desire to perceive its boundaries. Though these two approaches differ in name, they both arise from the same source and are called *Xuan* (mysterious).\n\n**Commentary by Hé Zhī (continued):**\n*\"Constant nonexistence\"* is not absolute nonexistence—it has always been so, hence *\"constant.\"* As in *The Liezi*: *\"The Great Ease\"* saw no *qi*; *\"The Great Beginning\"* was the start of *qi*; *\"The Great Commencement\"* was the start of form; *\"The Great Purity\"* was the start of substance. Following this sequence leads to confusion, hence it is called *\"mixed and indistinct.\"* Observing it in nonexistence reveals its profound mystery.\n\n*\"Constant existence\"* is not temporary existence—it is always so, hence *\"constant.\"* As in *The Liezi*: *\"The Ease transforms into Oneness; Oneness transforms into Seven; Seven transforms into Nine; Nine transforms back into Oneness.\"* Oneness is the beginning of form. It is also said: *\"When there is form, it returns to formlessness.\"* Observing it in existence reveals its inevitable return. The character *jiào* (徼) in both Laozi and Liezi commentaries means *\"return\"*—the return to its resting place. As in *The Zhuangzi*: *\"To reach the void and fulfill one’s seeking, to roam freely and grasp its end.\"* Here, the one and the none are observed together, and only what one does not seek to observe is not the Dao.\n\nThese two approaches share the same origin but differ in name. The *Daode Jing* states: *\"All things under Heaven arise from existence; existence arises from nonexistence.\"* Thus, their origin is the same, though their names differ. The subtle nonexistence is not nonexistence; the manifest existence is not existence. Hence, *\"The eternal can make the nonexistent exist; the nonexistent can make the eternal manifest.\"* Existence and nonexistence share the same name as *\"eternal,\"* thus both are called *Xuan*. Existence and nonexistence are one; nonexistence is inherently *Xuan*, and existence is also *Xuan*, hence *\"they are the same in mystery.\"* The *Daode Jing* says: *\"All things arise together; I observe their return.\"* The three observations—*\"subtle,\" \"boundaries,\"* and *\"return\"*—later reveal that *\"return\"* encompasses both *\"subtle\"* and *\"boundaries.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Lín Zhī (continued):**\nThe lines *\"constant nonexistence, constant existence\"* teach the ultimate realization. The word *\"desire\"* here carries deep meaning—it signifies *\"seeking.\"* One seeks this ultimate truth. Though existence and nonexistence appear as two, they share the same source despite differing names. If one constantly observes both nonexistence and existence, they are both called *Xuan*. *Xuan* is the marvel of creation. By observing thus, Laozi does not exclusively uphold emptiness. If he did, he would not say *\"they share the same source\"* or *\"both are called Xuan.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Ní Zhī:**\nExistence and nonexistence are both eternal aspects of the Dao. *\"Constant nonexistence\"* is the Dao before manifestation; *\"constant existence\"* is the Dao in manifestation. The Dao is eternally nonexistent yet eternally existent—existence and nonexistence generate each other and cannot be separated. The Dao’s nonexistence invites observation of its subtlety—the refined essence within. The Dao’s existence invites observation of its boundaries—the coarse manifestations at its edges. The world mistakenly claims Laozi speaks only of nonexistence, yet in this opening chapter, he presents both existence and nonexistence equally, never favoring one over the other. This reveals his intent in composing the text. Many commentators mistakenly split the lines into *\"without desire\"* and *\"with desire.\"* Desire is the obstruction of the Dao—without it, one may proceed. How could there ever be *\"with desire\"*?\n\n「○ Master Lü said: To observe the subtle is to gaze within. The subtle is the divine—divine in its transformation of all things, yet expressed through speech. Thus, the practice of inward observation restrains the restless mind, halts the cravings of desire, gathers the divine radiance, consolidates the pure *qi*, and solidifies the embryonic true essence.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* of the Supreme Sage contains the methods of inward and fixed observation, while the *Dao* of immortals and true ones teaches the techniques of *shōushì fǎn tīng* (withdrawing sight and reversing hearing). The *Zhēnjié* states: Inward observation is the root of spiritual immortality. *Jiào* (boundaries) refers to the edges and limits, as well as to the return (to the source).\n\n○ Master Dong said: All that is distant and without ultimate reach must be profound in hue—its essence is the boundless depth of the human heart, where no form is manifest. This is the meaning of *yānmò* (profound silence) in the *Guan Yin Zi*—the unmeasurable, the indivisible. Thus, he speaks of *Tiān* (Heaven), *Mìng* (Fate), *Shén* (Divine), and *Xuán* (Mysterious), all converging in the term *Dao* (Way).\n\n○ Some say: Why do all the schools interpret the passage as *\"constant nonexistence\"* and *\"constant existence with desire\"* when you alone take *\"constant nonexistence and constant existence\"*? I say: The schools’ interpretation is not without logic, but it fails to align with the deeper *Xuán* (Mysterious) meaning of the subsequent text. If existence is paired with desire, how can it be called *Xuán*? Again, those who cling to desire perish themselves—yet to perish is to attain *Xuán*, is this possible?\n\nAnother school suggests that *\"constant existence with desire\"* refers to the practice of skillful application, which is not without brilliance, yet it is also overly strained.\n\nIt is better to take *\"constant nonexistence and constant existence\"* as absolute—simple yet profound in meaning. Thus, I adhere to this reading.\n\n*\"Mysterious yet again mysterious—\nthe gateway to all subtleties.\"*\n\n○ Master He said: The subtleties are indeed subtle, yet the boundaries are also subtle—hence, *\"all subtleties.\"* The gateway refers to their origin. Many read this chapter only in terms of Heaven and Earth, yet the Sage’s intent is to be grasped from the heart.\n\n○ Master Lü said: The *Xuán* (Mysterious) is the ultimate of subtlety. Again, *Xuán* is Heaven—*Xuán* within *Xuán* is Heaven within Heaven. The *Yùluó Xiāotái* (Jade Tower of Obscurity), the *Yùshān Shàngjīng* (Jade Mountain Upper Palace), in the human body are the Heavenly Valleys and Divine Precincts of the brain and blood. They are the crystalline chamber of vital fluids, the source of the essence, and the dwelling of the hundred spirits—where the Great Lord of Self-Sustaining Life resides. When one observes with the divine essence the Heaven within Heaven, the embryonic immortality forms itself, the Heavenly Gate opens, and all spirits enter and exit through it. Hence, it is called *\"the gateway to all subtleties.\"*\n\n○ Master Chái said: The unfolding and closing of *Yīn* and *Yáng* (the cosmic forces), the emergence and retreat of essence and function—what more does this gate encompass?\n\n○ Master Liú said: *\"Mysterious yet again mysterious\"* speaks of the origin of all things in their natural state—this is the gateway through which all subtleties pass. This chapter first discusses the *Dao*, then Heaven and Earth, and finally the human heart—it is now complete. Scholars should reflect upon it in silence.\n\n○ Master Dong said: Both principle and phenomenon arise from this gate—hence, *\"the gateway to all subtleties.\"*\n\n**Chapter Two:**\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nthen it is ugliness.\nWhen all under Heaven know goodness as goodness,\nthen it is not goodness.\n\n○ Master He said: The *Dao* is formless yet all-encompassing, a symbol without substance. It molds and transforms, and thus all the beauty of Heaven and Earth is contained within it. The interplay of *Yīn* and *Yáng* (cosmic forces) nurtures virtue and completes nature—those who know this are better off forgetting what they know. How much more so when all under Heaven claim to know it!\n\nThus, to know beauty as beauty is not as good as to not know it as beauty—this is the ultimate beauty.\nWhen people know what is beautiful, beauty harbors ugliness, for their knowledge is shallow.\nTo know goodness as goodness is not as good as to not know it as goodness—this is the ultimate goodness.\nWhen people know what is good, goodness harbors not-goodness, for their knowledge is superficial.\n\n○ Master Lü said: The sage who embodies the *Dao* and fulfills virtue blends with all things, equal to their natural state. When all under Heaven know his beauty as beauty, I do not know it as beauty; when they know his goodness as goodness, I do not know it as goodness. In perfect harmony with all things, transcending duality, how could there be beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness?\n\nThe world fails to awaken to the truth that things were not always manifest. Lost in private perception, some take appearance, sound, and color as beauty, while others take wealth and honor as goodness. Once the deluded mind arises, they may praise what is ugly or what is not goodness. What is now rejected may later be embraced; what was once approved may now be condemned. Then, what choice is there between beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness?\n\n○ Master Wú said: The names of beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness, arise in relation to one another. Because ugliness exists, beauty exists; because not-goodness exists, goodness exists. When all know this as beauty, then that is ugliness; when all know this as goodness, then that is not-goodness. To erase both, to return them to the void, then neither beauty nor ugliness, goodness nor not-goodness, exists.\n\n○ Master Lín said: This chapter embodies the meaning of *\"having yet not dwelling\"*—when beauty is known, ugliness arises; when goodness is known, not-goodness arises. Beauty unknown as beauty, goodness unknown as goodness—then there is no ugliness, no not-goodness.\n\nThus, existence and nonexistence generate each other,\ndifficulty and ease complete each other,\nlong and short define each other,\nhigh and low depend on each other,\nsounds and responses harmonize each other,\nbefore and after follow each other.\n\n○ Master He said: To speak of nonexistence is to imply existence;\nto speak of existence is to imply nonexistence—this is their generation.\nDifficulty arises from ease,\nease is shaped by difficulty—this is their completion.\nA foot may be short where a cubit is long,\na high bank becomes a valley—this is their interdependence.\nThe crane’s call is answered by its mate,\nas sounds and responses follow one another—\njust as before and after, goodness and not-goodness,\nbeauty and ugliness, stand in constant opposition under Heaven.\nThe shallow in knowledge and perception,\nknowing beauty and goodness,\nare not as good as those who do not recognize them—\nthis is the ultimate goodness and beauty.\n\n○ Master Lǐ said: Existence arises from nonexistence,\nnonexistence arises from existence.\nDifficulty transforms into ease,\nease transforms into difficulty.\nThe long brings forth the short,\nthe short brings forth the long.\nOnce there is high, there must be low—\nsounds must harmonize in response,\nbefore must follow after, after must follow before.\nThus, existence and nonexistence,\ndifficulty and ease,\nare mutually dependent.\nBeauty brings forth ugliness,\ngoodness brings forth not-goodness.»\n\n○ **Master Lü said:** Once the Two Principles [Yin-Yang] are established, all things exist in pairs, thus they generate one another through existence and nonexistence, perfect one another through difficulty and ease, take form through long and short, incline through high and low, harmonize through sound, and follow through before and after—all motion arises from deliberate action.\n\n○ **Master Lin said:** These six sentences all illustrate the meaning of beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness from above.\n\n○ **Ouyang Xiu said:** The following of before and after, the forming of long and short—when extended broadly, this is the principle of all things.\n\nThough the *Dao De Jing* speaks as if of emptiness and nothingness, its teachings on governing the people are profound indeed. Therefore, the Sage acts in non-action and governs through silent instruction.\n\n○ **Master He said:** The Sage knows nonexistence and grasps the pivotal mechanism of knowledge, thus while others engage in affairs, the Sage dwells in non-affairs, finding amusement in the interplay of things—what concern does the Sage have for affairs?\n\nOthers speak endlessly, yet the Sage practices speechless speech. Though never uttering words, standing beside others, the Sage transforms them—what concern does the Sage have for speech?\n\n○ **Master Lü said:** Existence and nonexistence, difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, sound and voice, before and after—though these exist in pairs, they inevitably entail entanglement. Thus, the Sage abandons things and departs from people, standing alone above all things, not pairing with anything. As the *Classic* says: *\"Standing alone yet unchanging, nothing can pair with it.\"* Therefore, the Sage practices non-action, does nothing, forgets speech and forgets images, silently resonating with Nature—how could such a one rely on mere sounds?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* speaks of the utmost action as departing from action, the utmost speech as departing from speech—hence, *\"The Sage acts in non-action and governs through silent instruction.\"*\n\nAll things arise yet the Sage does not claim them, they are born yet the Sage does not possess them, the Sage acts yet does not rely on it, completing the work yet does not dwell upon it. Only because the Sage does not dwell upon it does it never depart.\n\n○ **Master He said:** The Sage acts, and all things observe; all things act, yet how could the Sage refuse responsibility for their arising? Though the Sage does not claim them as possession or rely upon them, the work belongs to the Sage—this cannot be rejected, for it is inevitable, not the Sage’s intention.\n\n○ **Master Lin said:** Heaven and Earth generate ten thousand transformations without ceasing—how could they refuse their labor? All things fill Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth never claim possession. As spring brings life and autumn brings death, yet Nature never boasts of its power—thus, *\"They are born yet the Sage does not possess them, acts yet does not rely on it.\"* The meaning lies in completing the work yet not dwelling upon it, hence these three phrases illuminate it.\n\n*\"Action\"* is akin to the *Yijing*’s *\"Kun\"* nurturing all things—this is the meaning of Shun and Yu ruling without claiming ownership. Those who possess what they have cannot truly possess it; those who do not possess what they have can truly possess it. The *Book of Documents* says: *\"Having virtue, yet losing it.\"* Thus, *\"Only because the Sage does not dwell upon it does it never depart.\"*\n\n○ **Master Li said:** Not refusing, not possessing, not relying, not dwelling—each forgets the other, and existence and nonexistence stand annulled. Thus, the True One endures eternally and never departs.\n\n○ **Master Lü said:** The Sage embodies the Dao within, yet his mind labors not; his responses to things are without measure. Thus, all things arise together, and he responds spontaneously—like a valley echoing sound, beauty and ugliness alike come to him without refusal. Hence, *\"All things arise together yet the Sage does not refuse.\"*\n\nSelf-formed, self-colored, self-generated, self-transformed—each fulfills its small or great nature, completing its essence. Who possesses it?\n\nThe *Guan Yinzi* says: *\"Things are not mine, yet I cannot but respond; I am not myself, yet I cannot but nourish.\"* Thus, responding to things yet never possessing them, nourishing oneself yet never possessing oneself—hence, *\"They are born yet the Sage does not possess them.\"*\n\nBenefiting ten thousand generations yet not claiming it as benevolence, covering Heaven and Earth yet not claiming it as greatness—hence, *\"The Sage acts yet does not rely on it.\"* The work covers the world yet seems not to emerge from the Sage; to acknowledge it would be confusion—hence, *\"The work is complete yet the Sage does not dwell upon it.\"*\n\nIf there is dwelling, there is departure—this is true of past and present. Within oneself, there is no dwelling; thus, things cannot displace it.\n\nOnly because the Sage does not dwell upon it, does not possess it, does not rely on it—thus, soaring with things above all things yet remaining unchanged, never departing.\n\n○ **Master Wu said:** *\"Action\"* refers to things about to arise. Not refusing, not possessing, not relying, not dwelling—these are the non-actions of Heaven and Earth. Not departing means enduring forever. Heaven and Earth do not dwell upon completing their work, thus their work endures eternally and never departs.\n\n○ **Master Dong said:** This chapter guides learners to a place where name and trace are both forgotten.\n\n**Chapter Three:**\nDo not exalt the worthy, so the people do not contend.\nDo not treasure rare goods, so the people do not become thieves.\nDo not display what is desirable, so the heart does not become disordered.\n\n○ **Master Li said:** If one does not boast of one’s own virtue, the people become pure. If one does not treasure rare goods, the people become wealthy. If one does not display what is desirable, the heart becomes settled.\n\n○ **Master Wu said:** *\"Exalt\"* means to honor; *\"treasure\"* means to value highly; *\"display\"* is akin to showing. If one does not exalt, does not treasure, it is as if one does not show what is desirable, thus the people’s hearts do not contend. Not becoming thieves is the same as not becoming disordered.\n\n○ **Master Lin said:** *\"Exalt\"* is the same as *\"boast.\"* If I boast of my virtue, then contention will arise throughout the world. Yu alone did not boast, and thus no one contended with him—this is the meaning.\n\nIf I value rare goods as treasures, then all people will have desires to obtain them, and their ruin will lead to theft. Only if one does not show what is desirable will the heart naturally settle.\n\nTherefore, the Sage empties the mind, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones.\n\n○ **Master Li said:** *\"Empty the mind\"* is to preserve one’s nature. *\"Fill the belly\"* is to preserve one’s life.\n\nWeakening the will, this is to preserve the spirit. Strengthening the bones, this is to preserve the form.\n\n○ **Master Lü said:** Earlier, it was said that one should not value rare goods, not show what is desirable—this is the same as emptying the mind. Not exalting virtue is the same as weakening the will. If one says only that the mind must be emptied, there is fear of sinking into dull emptiness. If one says only that the will must be weakened, there is fear of failing to stand firm. Therefore, the Sage’s cultivation of the self must include emptying the mind, filling the belly, weakening the will, and strengthening the bones. The empty must be paired with the full, the weak with the strong. A luminous spirit hall clears and brightens; a vacant chamber generates purity—untainted by a single speck of dust—this is emptying the mind. Once emptied, if one cannot inhale and exhale the Great Harmony, chew the essence of *Hāngzǐ*, drink the motherless *Xuānyīng*, or consume the celestial *Tiānguān* of the Great *Dàfán*, how can one fill the belly? Merely guarding the emptiness of nature—how could one then transcend the mortal coil, ascend in broad daylight?\n\nThus, it is clear that emptying the mind and filling the belly must not be neglected.\n\nTo humble oneself and remain lowly, to govern oneself with meekness—this is weakening the will. Though the will is weakened, if one cannot speak of the Dao in action, there will be nothing to establish oneself upon. How then could one achieve what the *Yijing* says: *\"Heaven’s movement is vigorous; the superior man strengthens himself with unremitting effort\"*? Those who refine internally may twist and turn against the flow, ascending through the Three Passes to nourish the brain—when the brain is full, the bones grow strong. Weakening the will and strengthening the bones must not be neglected—this is also clear.\n\n○ **Master He said:** Emptying the mind is purifying the origin and transcending the root. Filling the belly is accumulating essence and piling up *qi*. Separating the principles of emptiness and fullness, the spirit is preserved. Weakening the will is concentrating *qi* to achieve softness. Strengthening the bones is hearing the Dao and diligently practicing it. Following the yielding of *Kūn* and the vigor of *Qián*, virtue is preserved.\n\n○ **Master Chái said:** If one does not exalt oneself, does not value goods, and has no desires, then the mind naturally becomes empty and luminous, and the belly’s *qi* naturally fills. When the mind is empty of all things, the will becomes gentle and harmonious. When the belly is nourished, the bones grow strong. If one constantly keeps the people without knowledge or desire, then those who are wise dare not act. To act without action is to govern without failing.\n\n○ **Master He said:** When spirit and virtue are both complete, there is naturally a transformation without words, guiding the people without their knowing it. What was once known is now forgotten; what was once desired is now abandoned. As *Zhuangzi* says: *\"In harmony with the unknown, virtue does not depart. In harmony with the desireless, this is called pristine simplicity.\"* When the people return to their natural simplicity, how could they dare to act selfishly or scheme for others? The common people dare not act; the ruler acts without action. The subtle effect of perfect governance leaves no trace to follow.\n\n○ **Master Lin said:** In ancient times, the people were pure and simple, knowing nothing, desiring nothing. Though some among them had clever and scheming minds, even if their knowledge took root, they dared not act upon it. The Sage governs the world in this way. The Sage, in the world, has no place for the mind. In governance, all is done through *wuwei*, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.\n\n○ **Master Lü said:** *Wuwei* is the Dao. The Sage proclaims the Dao from above, and the people respond in harmony from below. Morning and evening, in times of chaos or order, the Dao is the only path. Without the Dao, one does not act; without the Dao, one does not speak. All actions must align with the Dao of *wuwei*. If one acts with deliberate action, the mind labors and the body grows weary, ending in exhaustion. But if one acts through *wuwei*—even if one consumes elixirs of refined essence, breathes celestial *qi*, rinses and swallows cloudy nectar, or refines the mysterious pearl—ascending to the heavens and coiling upon the earth, wielding marvelous transformations, with the body perfectly attuned—then it is said: *\"To act without action is to govern without failing.\"*\n\n○ **Master Dòng said:** This chapter speaks of forgetting exalted virtues, erasing thought, and returning to *wuwei* in harmony with the ultimate truth.\n\n**Chapter Four**\nThe Dao is boundless yet applied—sometimes it does not fill.\nDeep as the source of all things.\n\n○ **Master Wú said:** *\"Or\"* is a word of doubt, not certainty. The Dao’s essence is empty; those who use the Dao must also remain empty and unfilled. If filled, it is no longer the Dao. *\"Deep\"* means unfathomable. *\"Source\"* is the ancestral root, the lineage’s foundation. The Dao is the foundation of all things, hence *\"the source of all things.\"* *\"Seems\"* is another word of doubt, used in praise.\n\n○ **Master He said:** *\"Boundless\"* means empty. The Dao’s highest use lies in its emptiness. *Zhuangzi* knew that only when one understands the useless can one speak of use. If filled, the center is not empty, and its use is limited. *\"Seems\"*—how difficult it is to speak of it directly! This is the utmost emptiness.\n\n○ **Master Lin said:** *\"Boundless\"* means empty. Though the Dao’s essence is empty, its application is inexhaustible—sometimes filled, sometimes not, adapting to the moment. *\"Seems\"* is a word of doubt used in praise. *\"The source of all things\"* is what *Zhuangzi* called the Great Master.\n\n○ **Master Lǐ said:** *\"The Dao is boundless yet applied—sometimes it does not fill\"* means not being self-satisfied. Those who are not self-satisfied will inevitably benefit, blunting sharpness and resolving conflicts through the emptiness of the center and forgetting the self.\n\n○ **Master Lü said:** Heaven’s first creation is water, whose use lies in the center, hence *\"boundless.\"* The character for *\"boundless\"* combines water and center, speaking of the true One’s water within *qi*. This is called *\"boundless.\"* Boundless is *qi*; boundless is harmony. The True Person of Jin Hua said: *\"Boundless harmony enters the body to vitalize; the spirit of the grain knows the boundless use of ascension to Kunlun.\"* This is the true speech of the Dao’s boundless application. Yan Junping said: *\"Boundless takes emptiness as its dwelling; harmony takes non-action as its home. Using emptiness and non-being, one naturally avoids excess.\"*\n\n---\n\nBecause it does not overflow, it is profound—like the origin of all things.\nFor the profound is the deepest and unfathomable, the most tranquil and unmoved.\nThe origin of all things is none other than the Dao itself.\nThe origin is the ancestor: from One it generates Two, from Two it generates Three, and from Three it generates all things.\nThus, is the Dao not the ancestral origin of all things?\n\nIt blunts the sharp, resolves the tangled, harmonizes the radiant, and aligns with the mundane.\n\nMaster Wu said: The spoken is always dull, the luminous must dim—\njust as the full inevitably overflows.\nThe Dao does not seek fullness, so it blunts the sharp and does not wish it dull,\nit harmonizes the radiant and does not wish it bright—\nthese four lines speak of the Dao’s non-overflowing use.\n\nMaster Lin said:\nTo blunt the sharp is to smooth away all jaggedness.\nTo resolve the tangled is to order chaos with serene precision.\nTo harmonize the radiant is to shine without revealing.\nTo align with the mundane is to be unstained yet unconcerned with purity.\n\nMaster Li said:\nTo blunt the sharp and resolve the tangled,\nto harmonize the radiant and align with the mundane—\nthis is the emptiness of the center and forgetting the self.\n\nMaster Lü said:\nTo blunt the sharp is to crush the rigid, sharp *qi* of fame and gain,\nto dwell in simplicity, revealing no edges.\nTo resolve the tangled is to untangle the clamor of disturbance,\nto remain silent and detached, not engaging with things.\nThe radiant refers to brilliance; the mundane refers to worldly affairs.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says: *\"The vast and settled emit celestial light.\"*\nThe Confucian says: *\"Filled and luminous is called great.\"*\nNow, using boundlessness as principle, it is like the lush light of Heaven,\nthe essence of sun and moon flowing into the limbs—\nwithin, already filled and luminous, so naturally does radiance emerge,\npurely manifesting on face and back, differing from common folk.\nWhen boundless harmony is truly realized within,\nthe six *qi* also manifest externally—\none must only be gentle, yielding, and unassuming,\nblending into the world like dust, coexisting without distinction,\notherwise people will point to you as arrogant, eccentric, and unorthodox.\n\nMaster He said:\nHow is it empty? By blunting the sharp, resolving the tangled,\nharmonizing the radiant, and aligning with the mundane.\nThese four vanish without trace—\nthen the heart is like the Great Void,\nthe *grain spirit* responds with emptiness,\nthe Dao acts through boundlessness.\nThis chapter twice speaks of \"as if,\"—\nthese are living phrases, to be savored deeply.\n\nDeep and as if it exists.\nMaster Wu said:\n*Deep* means tranquil stillness—\nthe Dao’s essence is empty, hence its presence here.\nAs if it exists, yet nothing truly abides.\n\nThis line speaks of the Dao’s emptiness.\n\nMaster Lü said:\n*Deep* is clear and luminous, as if it exists yet does not—\nthe form of neither presence nor absence.\nGazing upward, it grows ever higher;\nprobing it, it grows ever firm;\nglancing ahead, it is before you—\nsuddenly, it is behind.\n\nMaster Lin said:\nAs if present, as if absent,\nas if real, as if void—\nthus, *deep and as if it exists.*\n\nI do not know whose child I am,\nthe ancestor before the Sovereign.\n\nMaster Wu said:\n*\"I do not know whose child I am\"*—a question.\n*\"The ancestor before the Sovereign\"*—an answer.\n*Sovereign* speaks of Heaven’s form; *ancestor* speaks of Heaven’s ruler.\nHeaven too arises from the Dao, hence *\"the ancestor before the Sovereign.\"*\n\nMaster Li said:\n*The ancestor before the Sovereign*—before the *Taiji* divided.\n\nMaster Lü said:\nThe *Huangting Jing* asks, *\"Who’s child am I within my body?\"*\nThis is *\"I do not know whose child I am.\"*\nIt is the self’s true nature, eternally present since antiquity,\naging not in ancient times—hence *\"the ancestor before the Sovereign.\"*\n\nMaster Dong said:\nThis chapter speaks of the wondrous root of boundless emptiness,\nand its unfathomable use.\n\n**Chapter Five**\nHeaven and Earth are not *ren*, treating all things as straw dogs.\nThe Sage is not *ren*, treating the people as straw dogs.\n\nMaster Wu said:\n*Ren* means to cherish with intent.\nA straw dog is grass bound into a dog’s shape, used in rain rituals.\nOnce the ritual ends, it is discarded—no further care is given.\nHeaven and Earth cherish nothing, yet allow all things to arise and complete themselves.\nThe Sage cherishes no one, yet lets the people act and rest as they will.\nThus, the straw dog is the analogy—\nfor the Sage’s heart is empty, with nothing to cling to.\nIf the Sage cherished the people, the heart would not be empty.\n\nMaster Lin said:\n*Nurturing* is *ren*—\nHeaven and Earth nurture things yet claim no merit, forgetting themselves with things.\nThe Sage nourishes the people yet claims no virtue, forgetting himself with the people.\n*Not-ren* means not possessing *ren*.\nA straw dog is used in sacrifice, then cast aside—\nthis illustrates forgetfulness without attachment.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The highest virtue lacks virtue, hence it has virtue.\"*\nNot-*ren* is like not possessing virtue.\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"Great *ren* is not *ren*.\"*\nAnd again: *\"In the age of perfect virtue, they love one another without calling it *ren*.\"*\nThis is the same meaning.\n\nMaster Lü said:\nHeaven and Earth, without favor, yet great favor arises.\nThe Sage, not-*ren*, yet great virtue is fulfilled—\nbecause they are without self.\nHeaven covers without partiality, Earth bears without favor,\nthe Sage transforms without attachment—\nwhen it should be born, it is born; when it should die, it dies.\nOnly the Original *qi* moves—\nHeaven, Earth, and the Sage never interfere with their own hearts.\nIt is like the straw dog.\n\n*Shu* is grass; bound *shu* forms a dog for sacrifice,\nhonored with reverence when in use—\nwrapped in fine silk, adorned with embroidery,\nthe officiant fasting and solemn in attendance.\nBut once the ritual ends,\npassersby tread upon it, cooks burn it—\nmerely discarded, of no further use.\n\n「Master Lü said:\nAt the times of spring’s birth and summer’s growth,\nHeaven and Earth seem to bestow boundless love—\nyet when autumn and winter come,\nand all things wither and fall,\nHeaven and Earth cannot save what they once gave life to.\n\nThe Sage, in times of pity and nurturing,\nappears to act with great compassion—\nyet when death arrives,\nthe Sage cannot rescue what must perish.\n\nIt is like honoring the straw dog before sacrifice,\nthen discarding it after the ritual ends.\nBefore the sacrifice, it must be revered—\nafter the sacrifice, it must be cast aside.\nThus, the straw dog serves as a metaphor for the birth and death of all things and people,\nshowing Heaven, Earth, and the Sage’s lack of partiality.\nIt is through their *not-ren* that their greatness is revealed.\n\nMaster Li said:\nHeaven covers without favor, Earth bears without favor,\ntransforming and nurturing the people and all things—\nthis can be called the utmost *ren*.\nBut to say they are not-*ren* is to forget their own nature.\n\nThe Sage loves the people and governs the state,\nand likewise cultivates the self and preserves life—\nbetween Heaven and Earth, it is akin to the *túshuǐ* [1].\n\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nmoving yet ever producing—\nthe more one speaks, the more one exhausts,\nyet better to hold fast to the center.\n\nMaster Wu said:\nThe *túshuǐ* is an instrument for blowing wind and igniting fire.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, it is like the *túshuǐ*—\ndiscarding form, embracing the Great Void [2],\ncontaining all things without limit.\nThe *shuǐ* symbolizes the Original *qi* [3],\nits *yīnyūn* [4] and flowing movement.\n\nTo say it is \"unyielding\" means its motion is direct,\nand \"ever producing\" means life is endless.\nOnly its emptiness as a *tú*,\nand its transformative function as a *shuǐ*,\n—where transformation is constant—\nthus its motion as *shuǐ* and its endless generation of life.\n\nIn Heaven and Earth, it is so—\nand in humans, it is the same:\nwhen the heart is empty of all things,\nand the *qi*’s pathways are unobstructed,\nthen the Original *qi* moves with regularity,\nand the life generated from the void grows ever more abundant.\n\n\"Exhausted\" means swift depletion,\nand \"exhaustion\" refers to *qi*’s depletion.\nIf a person speaks too much, their *qi* is consumed,\nthus hastening its exhaustion.\n\nBetter to keep the heart empty,\nfirmly guarding the spirit [5],\nso that nothing from outside enters,\nand nothing from within escapes—\nthen the void within has no bounds,\nand the life generated from it also knows no end.\n\nMaster Lin said:\nThe *túshuǐ* is used and wind arises,\nits form though empty, yet when applied, it is unyielding.\nMove it, and wind is produced—\nthe more it moves, the more it yields.\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nits generation of all things is likewise—\nhow could it harbor a heart for the wind?\n\nHeaven and Earth, in giving life to all things,\nhow could they harbor a heart for them?\nThus, this metaphor is used.»\n\nExcessive speech leads to swift depletion—\nbetter to guard the center,\nfor Heaven and Earth’s Dao cannot be exhausted by words.\nToo much speech only hastens one’s own exhaustion.\nBetter to remain silent and forget speech,\nas Confucius said:\n*“I wish to speak not at all—\nwhat words could Heaven have?\nThe four seasons pass in their course,\nand all things are born from them.”*\nThis is the very meaning.\n\n○ Master Li said:\nThis chapter concludes the meaning of *chōng* (emptiness) and its application.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, it is like the *túshuǐ*—\nits emptiness within,\nits unyielding stillness—\nno mind.\nWhen moved, it yields ever more—\nendless responsiveness to change.\n“Better to guard the center”\nis nothing but this emptiness within.\n\n○ Master Lǚ’s text records:\nThe True Person of the Marvelous Dao asked Laozi:\n*“What is the most essential chapter for cultivating the Dao and refining the body?”*\nLaozi replied:\n*“It is ‘Guarding the Center, Embracing the One, Deep Roots, Firm Foundation.’”*\nThe True Person asked:\n*“What is meant by ‘guarding the center’?”*\nLaozi said:\n*“The center is the Central Palace.\nConsider the infant in the womb—\nits navel cord connects to the mother’s,\ndrawing her *qi* in darkness.\nWhen she inhales, it inhales;\nwhen she exhales, it exhales.\nFor ten months, its *qi* is full, its spirit complete.\nAt birth, it detaches from the cord—\njust as a fruit, once ripe, falls from the tree.\nThe space three inches deep between the navel is called the Central Palace,\nalso the Yellow Court.\nIn men, it is the *Qi Sea*;\nin women, the womb.\nI was once taught by the Dao Sovereign of the Highest:\n‘Diligently guard the center,\nnever let it stray.\nKeep the outer from entering,\nthe inner from escaping.\nReturn to the Original Source—\nall matters will then be complete.’\n‘Diligently guard the center’ means\nfixing one’s mind on the Original Sea.\n‘Not letting it escape’ means\nletting the breath’s coming and going\nsettle naturally within the Central Palace,\nnever letting it disperse outward.\n‘Returning to the Original Source’ means\nthe navel is the origin of twelve thousand five hundred breaths,\nthe root of the *qi* for the five *zàng* and six *fǔ*.\nBy returning the breath to its source\nand guiding it with the spirit,\none makes the breath steady and still.’*\n\n**Chapter Six: The Immortal Valley-Spirit, Called the Mysterious Female**\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\n*“Valley”* refers to Heaven’s Valley,\n*“spirit”* to the original spirit of the body.\nHeaven’s Valley contains the transformations,\nholds the void and emptiness;\nEarth’s Valley contains all things,\nbears mountains and rivers.\nHumans, sharing the same origin as Heaven and Earth,\nalso possess a Valley.\nWithin it dwells the True One,\nthe abode of the original spirit.\nThus, the head has nine palaces,\ncorresponding to the nine heavens.\nThe central palace is called the *Níwán* (Mud Ball),\nalso the Purple Treasury.\nBeyond the nine palaces lies another,\nwith many names:\n*Liáotiān* (Boundless Heaven),\n*Tiānguān* (Heavenly Pass),\n*Yùjīngshān* (Jade Capital Mountain),\n*Kūnlún’s Peak*,\n*Tàyuān Pool*,\nand *Tiāngǔ* (Heavenly Valley)—\nthe palace where the original spirit resides.\nIts emptiness is like a valley,\nand the spirit dwells within—\nthus it is called the *Valley-Spirit*.\nWhen the spirit remains, life continues;\nwhen it departs, death follows.\nEven during the day, as one interacts with things,\nor at night, when lost in dreams,\nthe spirit is unsettled in its dwelling.\nIf it leaves and does not return,\nwandering without return,\nthen the path of life and death is severed.\nThus, it is said:\nHumans cannot live without the spirit’s life,\nnor die without the spirit’s death.\nYet the Valley-Spirit does not die—\nbecause of the *Mysterious Female*.\n\n*Xuán* (Mysterious) is the Yang,\nHeaven.\n*Pìn* (Female) is the Yin,\nEarth.\nThe Mysterious is Heaven’s color—\npure Yang, the void *qi* of emptiness,\nlight and clear, floating in Heaven.\nIts character is composed of *wú* (none) and *huǒ* (fire),\narising from the void,\ndwelling in the Mysterious Original Palace—\nthus it is called *Mysterious*.\nThe Female is Earth’s nature—\npure Yin, the substantial *qi* of the valley,\nheavy and turbid, sinking into Earth.\nIts character is composed of *qì* (breath) and *mǐ* (rice),\narising from substance,\ndwelling in the Female Original Treasury—\nthus it is called *Female*.\nThe two *qi* rise and fall between inhalation and exhalation.\nThere is a method to regulate them:\nReverse their natural flow,\nso that Yin does not grow excessive,\nand restore their origin,\nso that Yang does not weaken.\nTransform the having into the void,\nthe void into having—\nusing the substantial *qi* of the Original Earth\nto ascend and expel it,\nand the void *qi* of Heaven’s Original\nto descend and return it.\nWhen Heaven’s *qi* returns to the body,\nthe turbid Yin naturally dissipates,\nrestoring one to pure Yang.\nThus it is said:\n*“Return the Heavenly *qi* above\nto govern the nine heavens’ souls.”*\nTherefore, the Mysterious Female’s two *qi*\neach hold profound meaning—\nunless one meets a sage\nwho transmits oral instructions,\nthey cannot be known.\nIf one knows the origin of the two *qi*,\nthen one knows the mystery of the Mysterious Female.\nNourish the *Tàihé* (Great Harmony),\ninherit the *Qi Mother*,\nto nourish the spirit.\nThe spirit depends on its darkness,\nreturning to the Valley—\nthus it does not die.\nIs this not the function of the Mysterious Female?\nThus it is said:\n*“The Valley-Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.”*\nFrom the *Língshū Shénjǐng Neijing*:\n*“Heaven’s Valley, the original spirit—\nguard it, and it will remain true.\nAbove and below, the Mysterious Female—\nchild and mother in harmony.”*\nIt is also said:\n*“The Mysterious Female is the vessel of Heaven and Earth;\nseize it with the spirit,\nobtain it with the true—\nthe way of ascent and descent.”*\n\n○ Master Hé said:\n*“Valley”* is emptiness,\nthe dwelling of the spirit.\nFrom vigor to old age to death,\nthe spirit scatters from dissipation,\nyet people do not know to rest quietly and nourish it.\nEven if one sits in repose all day,\nif the mind wanders outward,\nthe Valley will not be empty,\nthe spirit will not remain—\nhow then can one avoid death?\nOnly by seeking the essence in the profound darkness,\nseeking things in the hazy uncertainty,\nwith form and spirit merging perfectly,\nuniting with the Dao’s truth,\ncan one achieve longevity.\n*Xuán* is Heaven—emptiness;\n*Pìn* is Earth—stillness.\nIf one accumulates emptiness to communicate with the spirit,\nattains stillness to nourish the true,\nthen the Dao of the Mysterious Female’s immortality is realized.\n\n○ Master Li said:\n*“The Valley-Spirit does not die”—\nthe void and spirit remain unobscured.\n*The Mysterious Female*—\none Yin, one Yang.\n\n「The Gate of the Mysterious Female,\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nMaster Lü said:\nSince the Mysterious Female’s essence is defined by ascent and descent,\nthen the *Gate* refers to the doorway through which the two primal forces—Yin and Yang—\nneither emerge nor vanish.\n\nBefore the *Dirt Pellet Palace* (泥丸宮) lies the *Bright Hall* (明堂),\nwhich extends downward to the nostrils,\nhence the nostrils are the *Gate of the Mysterious Female*.\nThe nostrils connect the Six Palaces (六府) with the passage of *qi*,\nwhere the light and subtle *qi* interfaces with Heaven,\nthus it is called the *Heavenly Root*.\n\nAbove the *Mystery of the Primordial Mother* (牝元宮) lies the *Yellow Court* (黃庭),\nwhich ascends through the *Heavy Chamber* (重楼) to the mouth,\nhence the mouth is the *Gate of the Mysterious Female*.\nThe mouth connects the Five Organs (五臟) with the passage of *qi*,\nwhere the heavy and turbid *qi* interfaces with Earth,\nthus it is called the *Earthly Root*.\n\nThe common folk do not exhaust its source,\nnor probe its origin,\nand so they merely call the nostrils *Mysterious Female* (玄)\nand the mouth *Primordial Mother* (牝).\nThen what else could the *Gate of the Mysterious Female* be named?\nThis is due to their failure to grasp its subtlety.\n\n○ Master He said:\nWhen emptiness is perfected and stillness is steadfastly maintained,\nentering through this Gate,\nthe roots of Heaven and Earth are fully attained.\n\nHeaven bestows *qi*, Earth bestows *jing* (精),\nwhen gathered, they form spirit—\nthis is their root.\nIf the root is not plucked,\nthen life may endure long.\nHence it is said: *\"My life lies in me, not in Heaven and Earth,\"*\nand again: *\"I share one breath of *qi* with Heaven and Earth,\ngoverning myself by preserving the root—this is the Way.\"*\n\n○ Master Ni said:\n*Mysterious Female* (玄) is the Yang—\nthe *Heavenly Stem* (乾).\n*Primordial Mother* (牝) is the Yin—\nthe *Earthly Receptacle* (坤).\nThe *Gate* is the path of emergence and return,\nthe opening and closing of *Heavenly Stem* and *Earthly Receptacle*.\nThe *Root* is like the root of a tree—\nthe origin of life.\n\nAs the *Yì* (易) says:\n*\"The Great Polarity* (太極) *is the origin of the Two Forces* (兩儀).\"\nAnd again:\n*\"The *Heavenly Stem* and *Earthly Receptacle*—\nthese are the Gates of the *Yì*.\"*\n\n○ Master Li said:\n*\"One closing, one opening—\ngenerating Heaven, generating Earth.\"*\n\n○ Master Liú said:\n*Mysterious Female* (玄) is the Yang,\n*Primordial Mother* (牝) is the Yin.\nThe *Gate* is the keyhole of the two *qi*—\nas the previous chapter says: *\"the Gate of all wonders,\"*\nand as the saying goes: *\"Who can exit without passing through the door?\nWhy not follow this Way?\"*\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth existed,\nthe *Original Breath* (元氣) was first—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nContinuous and unceasing,\nit is used without exhaustion.\nMaster Lü said:\nContinuous and unceasing—\nlike a thread that never breaks.\nWhen the two *qi* of the Mysterious Female enter their root,\nif the closing is too extreme, they lose it to haste;\nif they are left unrestrained, they lose it to turbulence—\nboth are incorrect.\nTo achieve true continuity without interruption,\nas if present yet not present,\nas if absent yet not absent,\nthe true breath arrives at perfect equilibrium,\nlike the turtle’s retreat,\nlike the serpent’s repose—\nnever reaching exhaustion or urgency.\n\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* (莊子) says:\n*\"The ancient true ones,\ntheir breathing profound and deep,\nbreathing with the heel of their foot.*\n*The *Língshū* (靈樞) of the *Inner Canon* (內經):*\n*\"Mingled chaos and numinous response,\nascending clouds to refine the root—\ncontinuous and unceasing,\nusing it—how could it be exhausted?\"*\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nContinuous and everlasting,\nboundless and inexhaustible—\nit seems to exist yet does not.\nIf it were exhausted,\nthen life would be labored and depleted.\nThe *Grand Historian* (太史公) said:\n*\"In all people,\nthe essence of life is spirit,\nthe vessel is form.\nIf spirit is overused, it will be depleted;\nif form is overtaxed, it will be impaired.\nWhen form and spirit separate, death ensues.\"*\n\n○ Master Wú said:\nContinuous and unceasing—\nlong-lasting without interruption.\n*Store*—\nspirit’s abiding presence.\n*Exhaust*—\nlabor and depletion.\nIf *qi* is used with ease, it nurtures and grows daily;\nif *qi* is used with agitation, it is consumed and depleted.\nThe statement that spirit endures within,\nthen *qi* is not exhausted.\n\n○ Master Li said:\n*\"One closing, one opening—\na ceaseless flow,\nno one knows its measure.\nIn motion and stillness, no confusion,\nno strain of effort,\neternally generating and transforming.\"*\n\nThe *Lièzǐ* (列子) fully records this chapter,\nand then says: *\"The Yellow Emperor’s Book says...\"*\nAccording to the *Inner Transmission* (內傳) of *Gěxiān Gōng* (葛仙公),\nwhen the Yellow Emperor was emperor,\nthe *Laozi* (老君), as *Guǎngchéngzǐ* (廣成子),\nexplained this scripture to him.\nThus the emperor wrote it down,\nquoting this chapter as follows.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure long,\nbecause they can endure long.\nHeaven and Earth are able to endure long\nbecause they do not generate themselves—\nthus they endure long.\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nHeaven and Earth are unified in generating things,\nyet do not generate themselves.\nThe scripture says:\n*\"Generating yet not possessing,\nenduring yet not controlling—\nthis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\"*\nAll speak of Heaven and Earth not generating themselves,\nyet being able to endure long—\nthus it is said:\n*\"Ample and profound—\nthus they bear things;\nHigh and luminous—\nthus they cover things;\nEndless and enduring—\nthus they complete things.\"*\nThe three phrases all concern generating things,\nyet do not mention Heaven and Earth generating themselves.\n\n○ Master Li said:\nHeaven does not generate Heaven,\nEarth does not generate Earth—\nthus life does not cease.\n\n○ Master Lín said:\nThis chapter uses Heaven and Earth to illustrate\nthe sage’s lack of contrivance.\nHeaven and Earth generate all things,\nnaturally and effortlessly,\nwithout contrivance—\nthus ten thousand years are like one day.\n\nTherefore, the sage places his body last yet it is first,\nplaces his body externally yet it endures—\nnot because he has no selfish desires,\nbut because he fulfills them.\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nThe sage aligns with Heaven and Earth without boundary,\naccepts the bearing and covering with selflessness,\nlaboring for the world.\nIs it not because Heaven and Earth share the same root with me,\nand all things share the same body with me?\nAll take what is before themselves,\nbut I alone take what is after—\nby taking what is after, others are placed before.\nAll take what is solid for themselves,\nbut I alone take what is empty—\nmy form is placed externally,\nwhile the Way is preserved within.\n\nAnd again:\n*\"The sage takes the Dao as his body,\nyet has no body—\nwhat selfishness could there be?\nThis is how he harmonizes with Heaven and Earth without end.\"*\n\n○ Master Wú said:\n*Placing last*—\nhumility, abasement below.\n*Placing first*—\nexaltation, elevation above.\n*Placing externally*—\nclearing stillness, non-action.\n*Enduring*—\nlongevity, abiding in the world.\n*Selflessness*—\nplacing his body last, placing his body externally.\n*Fulfilling selfishness*—\nhis body is first, his body endures.\nThe sage does not desire to fulfill selfishness,\nyet naturally achieves the effects of his body being first and enduring.\nIf one were to assume that all people have contrivance to fulfill their selfishness,\nthen it would be possible to speak of it as such.\nBut the sage’s actions are not contrived.»\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nThe sage does not claim his own sainthood,\nthus he aligns with Heaven and Earth in **virtue/power** without end.\n\n○ Master Lín said:\nIn the sage’s cultivation of the self,\nthere is no **mind of distinction** between first and last,\nno **mind of distinction** between inner and outer,\nthus none can surpass him yet he remains ever present.\nHence, he is without selfishness yet achieves the effects of his selfishness.\nThis is not the selfishness of public and private gain,\nfor if it were, one could not say he has no **mind of distinction**.\nThese words reveal Lǎozǐ’s intent to guide people toward goodness,\nand when the **Release** [Buddhist schools] expound upon them,\nthey speak of *true emptiness, real existence*—\n*true emptiness* is the meaning of **selflessness**,\n*real existence* is the meaning of **achieving the effects of his selfishness**.\n\n○ Master Héshàng Gōng said:\nWhen people speak of selfishness,\nthey mean to enrich themselves.\nThe sage, without selfishness, enriches himself naturally,\nthus achieving the effects of his selfishness.\n\n---\n*Chapter Eight of the Daoist Canon: The Collection of Meanings*\n**上善若水** [The highest virtue is like water],\nwater benefits all things yet does not contend,\ndwelling where people deem vile,\nthus it is close to the Dao.\n\n○ Master Lín said:\nThis chapter again uses water to illustrate the meaning of **no mind of distinction**.\n**上善** [The highest virtue] refers to the utmost goodness in the world,\nits principle being akin to water’s nature.\nWater’s goodness lies in its ability to benefit all things—\nyet how often does it regard itself as capable?\nFollowing the current without resistance,\nit does not contend.\nEmbracing the low and the moist,\nit does not deem what others abhor as vile.\nWhen observed thus, water is near the Dao.\n**几** [Close], meaning **near**.\n\n○ Master Wú said:\n**上善** [The highest virtue] is the utmost extreme of virtue—\nthe virtue of those who follow the Dao.\nWhy is it like water?\nWater’s virtue lies in its irrigation and cleansing,\nits function of benefiting all things,\nyet it does not vie for high or pure places;\ninstead, it dwells in the vile and lowly spots people despise,\nthus it is close to the virtue of those who follow the Dao.\n**几** [Close], meaning **near**.\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\nNone surpass the **highest virtue** in embodying\nthe mystery of **Heaven’s One** [天一],\nthe essence of **Dao’s One** [道一],\nor fulfilling the function of **uppermost goodness**.\nWater, whether square or round, solid or fluid,\nconforms to its natural suitability—\nthis is how the sage examines the Dao,\nmodels its goodness,\nand responds to change with the times,\nlike water’s nature—\nsometimes firm, sometimes yielding,\nsometimes square, sometimes round,\nneither too much nor too little,\nthus it is said: **The highest virtue is like water**.\nThe **perfected person** [至人] unifies the Dao through One,\nand One through the Dao,\nso water is used to illustrate the **heart** [mind],\nand the **heart** [mind] is used to craft the Dao.\nMoreover, the *Shāngtóng Qì* [《参同契》] states:\n**\"One\"** is the **pivot of the Dao** [道枢],\nknowing white yet guarding black—\nall interpretations by **Péng Zhēn** [彭真人] are of **One**.\nIndeed, **golden elixir** [金液] and **jade elixir** [玉液]\nare the **pivots of the Dao** for the **golden elixir method** [金丹之道枢],\nirrigating the five **zàng organs** [五脏],\nnourishing the three **tián fields** [三田],\nswilling and descending with ease,\ncirculating and flowing without obstruction—\nthe *Huángtíng Jīng* [《黄庭经》] says:\n*\"Swilling the elixir essence, calamities do not adhere.\"*\nWithin **qi** [炁] lies **true One’s water** [真一之水],\nand within water lies **true One’s qi** [真一之炁],\nthus the **Flowering Pool** [华池] is the source of **uppermost goodness’s** benefits.\n\nDwelling in the **virtue of goodness** [善地],\nthe **heart** [mind] is the **virtue of depth** [善渊],\ngiving is the **virtue of generosity** [善仁],\nspeech is the **virtue of trustworthiness** [善信],\ngovernance is the **virtue of order** [善治],\naction is the **virtue of capability** [善能],\nmovement is the **virtue of timeliness** [善时].\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nThe opening line, **\"The highest virtue is like water\"**,**\ndoes not merely state that water is good;\nit earnestly urges all people to emulate it,\nto resemble water in possessing all these virtues of the utmost goodness.\n**Like water** is **like the Dao**.\nThus, the **virtue of goodness in dwelling** is akin to water’s relation to the earth—\nwater flows when it meets the earth,\nthe earth softens when it meets water;\nhow could it hoard its place of dwelling?\nThe **virtue of goodness in the heart** is like water’s relation to the depths—\npeople do not reflect in flowing water,\nbut in still water;\nhow could they lose their original mind?\nThe **virtue of goodness in giving** is like water’s relation to the seven [orifices]—\nit measures and pours for others,\nhow could it indulge others’ desires?\nThe **virtue of goodness in speech** is like water’s trustworthiness—\nit rises and falls with the tides,\nhow could it go back on its word?\nThe **virtue of goodness in governance** is like water’s relation to order—\nit adjusts like a balance scale,\nhow could it raise or lower its hand arbitrarily?\nThe **virtue of goodness in action** is like water’s relation to capability—\nit is capable of both square and round,\nhow could it not exhaust all means and adapt to all changes?\nThe **virtue of goodness in movement** is like water’s relation to the times—\nit halts when still, flows when moving,\nhow could it not respond to circumstances and follow natural course?\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nDwelling in the **virtue of goodness** [善地] is to benefit others.\nThe **heart** [mind] being the **virtue of depth** [善渊] is to contain all things.\nGiving as the **virtue of generosity** [善仁] is to nurture life.\nSpeech as the **virtue of trustworthiness** [善信] is to respond to all things.\nGovernance as the **virtue of order** [善治] is to transform all things.\nAction as the **virtue of capability** [善能] is to accomplish all things.\nMovement as the **virtue of timeliness** [善时] is to follow all things.\nOnly because it does not contend,\nthere is no blame against it.\n\n○ Master Lín said:\nThe seven virtues mentioned above\nall describe the goodness of those who follow the Dao,\nyet they do not regard themselves as capable—\nthus, in the world, they contend with none,\nnor do they invite blame or resentment.\nThis is the meaning of:\n*\"Only because you do not contend,\nno one in the world can contend with you.\"*\n\nMany commentators take this as the **seven lesser virtues of water**,\nso their explanations often strain the meaning—\nnot the original intent of Lǎozǐ.\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nTo encompass these several virtues,\nto begin with **non-contention** and end with **non-contention**,\nis the utmost of goodness.\nWho can emulate it?\nThus there is no blame against it.\nThe unvirtuous invite blame,\nand even if virtuous, if they cannot avoid contention,\nthey too may invite blame.\nBut if one is both virtuous and without contention,\nwhat blame could there be?\nThis is why water’s virtue resembles the Dao.\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nWater embodies **gentleness and harmony**,\ndwelling in the low—\nbenefiting all things yet not contending,\nthus there is no blame against it.\n\n○ Master Wú said:\nOnly the **uppermost goodness** of those who follow the Dao\ndoes not vie for high places yet willingly dwells in the low,\nthus people do not blame them.\n**尤** [Blame] means **resentment and censure**,\nso those who desire to rise above others\ncannot avoid a **mind of contention**,\nand where there is contention, there is blame.\n\n---\n*Chapter Nine of the Daoist Canon: The Collection of Meanings*\n**To hold and fill it** [持而盈之],\n**is not as good as letting it be** [不如其已].\n**To grasp and sharpen it** [揣而锐之],\n**cannot be long preserved** [不可长保].\n\n「Master Lín said:\nThis chapter speaks only of how advancement is not as good as retreat,\nthus using *holding and filling* [持而盈之] and *grasping and sharpening* [揣而锐之] as metaphors.\nA vessel that is filled to overflowing must spill—\nto hold it is difficult,\nyet it is easier to preserve what is not filled.\n**已** [already/stop] means the intent of not filling it.\n**揣** [grasp] means **治** [refine], **锐** [sharp] means **铦** [keen].\nTo refine a vessel to its utmost keenness and sharpness,\nwithout fail it will break—\nthus, it is better to preserve what is not sharpened for long.\n\n○ Master Wú said:\n**持** [hold] means to **捧** [carry].\n**已** [already/stop] means to **止** [cease].\nThis chapter states that the Dao does not desire to be filled,\nfor when filled, it easily leads to overflowing—\nyet it is better to cease and avoid filling.\nThe **锋** [edge] cannot remain sharp,\nfor when sharpened, it easily leads to **到** [bluntness],\nand its sharpness cannot be long preserved.\nTo fill is also to invite the loss of what is filled—\nthis is the reason as well.\n\n○ Master Liú said:\nTo be filled is to be bound to emptiness—\nbe warned against fullness.\nTo be sharpened is to be bound to dullness—\nbe warned against excess.\nGold and jade filling the hall,\nno one can guard them.\nWealth and honor with arrogance,\none invites their own downfall.\nWhen one’s achievements are complete and name established,\nto retreat is the Dao of Heaven.\nMaster Lín said:\nWhen wealth and honor reach the point of gold and jade filling the hall,\none cannot long preserve them.\nTo dwell in the rank of king or noble yet reach arrogance and fullness,\none brings upon oneself the consequences of that.\nThus, those who wish to preserve their achievements\nand safeguard their reputation must know to retreat early—\nonly then does one align with Heaven’s Dao.\n**功成** [achievements complete] and **名遂** [reputation established]\nare terms that vary with greatness and smallness,\nyet one can still preserve them—\nhence the words *complete* and *established*.\nIf one does not know when to stop,\nthen when is it ever complete?\nWhen is it ever established?\nThese four characters must be carefully examined.\n\n○ Master Wú said:\nIn the world, there are those who have gold and jade filling their halls\nyet cannot guard them—\nwhy is this?\nIt is because wealth and honor breed arrogance,\nand one invites their own downfall.\nThus, when achievements are complete and reputation established,\nto retreat is in accord with Heaven’s Dao—\nthis is the saying of *not desiring to be filled*.\nGold and jade filling the hall means wealth,\narrogance means those who fill themselves—\ntheir misfortune is self-inflicted, not by others.\nAchievements complete and reputation established means honor,\nto retreat means to not fill oneself—\nHeaven’s Dao is empty yet not filled,\nthus the sequence of the four seasons.\nThose who achieve success depart.\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nAchievements complete and reputation established,\nyet one retreats—\nthis is the warning against excess and the encouragement of humility.\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n*\"To know advancement and retreat, survival and perishing,\nyet never lose one’s true path—\nwho but the Sage can do so?\"*\nLù Xīshēng said:\nTo carry a great vessel and be filled to overflowing,\neven if one fears it, it is better to cease early.\nTo occupy a high position and be extreme in one’s conduct,\neven if one worries, it is better to withdraw early.\nAs for following the wanderings of the Red Pine [赤松],\nor drifting away in a small boat [扁舟],\nthis also clearly shows the meaning of *not desiring to be filled*.\n\n○ Master Liú said:\nGold and jade must accumulate—\nbe warned against greed.\nWealth and honor must lead to licentiousness—\nbe warned against pride.\nAchievements complete and reputation established must bring danger—\nbe warned against not knowing when to stop.\nThe words of the Master Lǎo are deeply meant to save people—\nnot saying that those who abandon worldly affairs and dwell in the mountains and forests\ncan enter the Dao.\nEven while residing in the realm of wealth, honor, achievements, and reputation,\nall can be diligently practiced.\n\n---\n**Chapter Ten**\nTo carry the **魂** [hun/soul] and embrace the **一** [One],\ncan one avoid separation?\nTo focus **炁** [qi] and attain **柔** [gentleness],\ncan one be like an infant?\n○ Master Hé said:\nTo embrace the One without separation,\nthe child can guard the One,\nand the One also guards the child.\nTo focus **炁** [qi] and attain **柔** [gentleness],\nto be like an infant—\nthe scripture says: *\"The depth of virtue is compared to an infant,\nbones weak, sinews soft, yet grip firm.\"*\nTo focus **炁** [qi] is to preserve **纯气** [pure qi].\nTo attain **柔** [gentleness] is to reach **至和** [ultimate harmony] without deviation.\nThis is how the Great Person never loses the heart of an infant.\n\n○ Master Lín said:\n**载** [carry] is like a cart carrying goods.\nAn infant has not yet encountered sights or sounds,\nthus its **炁** [qi] is focused.\n**致** [attain] means **极** [to reach the utmost],\n**柔** [gentleness] means **顺** [to comply].\nIf one can be like an infant in focusing **炁** [qi] and attaining gentleness,\nthen one can embrace the One.\nHence it is said: *\"To focus qi and attain gentleness,\ncan one be like an infant?\"*\nThis is the Master Lǎo’s rhetorical question.\nIt means: *\"Can people truly do this?\"*\nThe following sentences are all in this vein.\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\nA strong **魂** [hun/soul] is the companion of life,\na robust **魄** [pò/soul] is the companion of death.\nThe **魂** [hun/soul], belonging to **阳** [yang], delights in clarity and emptiness,\nwhile the **魄** [pò/soul], belonging to **阴** [yin], thrives in agitation and disturbance.\nThe **魄** [pò/soul] is the **阳** [yang]'s thief,\nand moreover, the nature of the **魄** [pò/soul] is to:\nindulge people in sensory pleasures,\npursue superficial splendor,\nbe lost in drowsiness and slumber,\nand roam freely—\ndraining one’s vital essence and **精气** [jing-qi],\nleading people to perish,\nso that after the body decays,\nit may enjoy their sacrifices.\nThus, the Sage governs **神** [spirit] with **炁** [qi],\nand restrains **魄** [pò/soul] with the form,\nfollowing the method of Earth’s use—\nsettled, tranquil, and deeply rooted,\nsteadfast and unmoving.\nThough the **阴魄** [yin-pò/soul] may desire to agitate,\nstirring one’s thoughts and worries,\ncan it truly succeed?\nHence it is said: *\"To carry the魄 [pò/soul].\"*\nThe original method of carrying it\nis to embrace the One without separation.\nTo embrace the One is like a mirror containing clarity—\nhow could clarity ever separate from the mirror?\nYet one fears that the carrying may not be thorough,\nso though pure and unchanging,\nit is called *not two*—\nonly then can the spirit be complete and unharmed,\nthe essence be used without depletion,\nand never for an instant be separated.\nHence it is said: *\"To embrace the One,\ncan one avoid separation?\"*\nMoreover, if the spirit is not governed,\nthe qi will be disordered;\nif the spirit is governed,\nthe qi will not act recklessly.\n\nThe Perfect Person excels in regulation and control,\nfocused on sincerity and purity.\nThey nourish it with **虚** [emptiness],\nand rest it with **踵** [retreat].\nPure, refined, and gentle,\ntheir cultivation of **炁** [qi] is like that of the **灵龟** [spiritual tortoise],\nand their nurturing of the spirit is like that of an infant.\nAn infant embodies the depth of virtue,\ndwelling in ignorance of what to do,\nmoving without knowing where to go—\nhence it is said: *\"To focus qi and attain gentleness,\ncan one be like an infant?\"*\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nTo carry the **魄** [pò/soul] is like the metaphor of a cart carrying goods.\nThe **魄** [pò/soul] loves movement,\nloves to roam freely,\nloves sharpness and vigor—\nthus it is called *campaigning魄 [pò/soul]*.\nThe **魄** [pò/soul] belongs to yin;\nwhen yin is excessive, it harms yang,\nand when emotions are excessive, they enslave the nature.\nThose who can subdue and restrain it\nembrace the One without separation,\nattain gentleness without flaw,\nand practice *non-action as the female*—\nnon-knowing makes the yin **魄** [pò/soul] unable to indulge its emotions.\nWhen the **魄** [pò/soul] is subdued and yin is consumed,\nthe spirit becomes serene and the nature tranquil.»\n\n---\n\nWithout constraint, it moves naturally of its own accord,\nlike returning with treasure-laden hands—\nfrom embracing the One downward,\npurely the meaning of carrying the **pò/soul**.\n\nTo purify and remove the **玄鉴** [xuánjiàn/mysterious mirror],\ncan one be without flaw?\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nWhen Guān Yīn Zǐ knows the heart is without substance,\nthen he knows all things are without substance.\nWhen he knows all things are without substance,\nthen he knows the Dao is without substance—\nthus he does not revere words of mysterious profundity.\nThose who ponder mysterious profundity only harm their spirit.\nThis speaks of washing away the **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision],\nremoving the heart’s blemishes,\nthus attaining flawlessness.\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\nNot being swayed by the **pò/soul**,\ninternally not being controlled by **qi**,\ncleansing all thoughts and discarding all desires—\nthis is called **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision].\nThe **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision] observes its subtlety,\nyet it is not what the eyes can see.\nExcluding the utmost truth,\nall else is screened away—\nexterior and interior, hollow and clear,\nnaturally empty and resonant.\nThe spiritual repository is serene and still—\nonly then can one attain **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision].\nOnce **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision] is attained,\nit becomes an obstacle to **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision] itself—\nwhen **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision] is removed,\nthen there is no flaw.\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nSeeing nothing, hearing nothing—\ndust cleansed, the mirror bright.\n\n○ Master Dòng said:\nIf the vision of mysterious profundity is not removed,\nit is like untying bonds.\nIf traces of purification remain,\nit is like an obstacle to awakening.\nWhen there is no flaw,\nthe love of dharma fades and duality is extinguished.\n\nTo love the nation and govern the people—\ncan one practice non-action?\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nThe Yellow Emperor’s writings on enriching the nation and securing the people\nare methods of refining **qi**.\nThe Sage takes the body as the nation,\nthe heart as the ruler,\n**精氣** [jīngqì/essence-qi] as the people—\nwhen the people are at ease, the nation prospers;\nwhen the people scatter, the nation weakens.\nWhen the heart practices non-action, **qi** harmonizes—\nwhen **qi** harmonizes, all treasures gather.\nWhen the heart acts, **qi** becomes disordered—\nwhen **qi** is disordered, brilliance disperses.\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\nThe perfected one governs the body\njust as one governs a nation—\nloving the people is how one secures the nation,\nloving **qi** is how one preserves the body.\nThose who love the body well\ntake the heart as ruler,\nblood as ministers,\n**qi** as the people.\nUnifying nature, nurturing **qi**,\nfilling every passage,\ntreasuring and regulating it,\nletting it flow naturally—\nthen what need is there for action?\n\nGoverning the nation and the body—\ntheir principles are one and the same.\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nUnmoving, unshaken—\nthe Dao flourishes, the times are clear.\n\nThe opening and closing of the **天門** [tiānmén/Heaven’s Gate],\ncan one avoid being **雌** [cí/female]?\n\n○ Master Hé said:\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"There is an exit and an entrance,\nentering and exiting without seeing its form—\nthis is called the Heaven’s Gate.\"*\nIt also says: *\"If the heart rejects this,\nthe Heaven’s Gate will not open.\"*\nThis speaks of the Heaven’s Gate as the **玄門** [xuánmén/mysterious gate].\nThe transformation of opening and closing—\nguarding stillness, guarding softness—\nis to guard **雌** [cí/female].\n○ Master Lín said:\nThe Heaven’s Gate is the natural principle between Heaven and Earth.\n○ Master Niè said:\nThe Heaven’s Gate is **乾** [qián/Heaven],\n*Yijing* calls it the \"door\"—\nwhere there is opening, there must be closing,\nopening and closing mutually functioning.\n\nSome say: *\"能無雌\"* [néng wú cí/can one avoid being female]\nshould be *\"能為雌\"* [néng wéi cí/can one be female],\nyet following the context above—*\"能無雌乎\"* [néng wú cí hū/can one avoid being female]—\nit means one does not desire flaws.\nTo say *\"能無為乎\"* [néng wú wéi hū/can one practice non-action]\nis to say one does not desire action.\nNow to say *\"能無雌\"* [néng wú cí/can one avoid being female]\nis to say one does not desire **雌** [cí/female].\nLaozi values softness above all—\nyet to say *\"無雌\"* [wú cí/avoid being female]\nis to unify in **雌** [cí/female] while having no **雄** [xióng/male],\nmeaning one can close but cannot open—\nthis is not the Heaven’s Gate.\nThus, the meaning of *\"無雌\"* [wú cí/avoid being female]\nis to supplement yin with yang.\n\nSome manuscripts say *\"能為雌\"* [néng wéi cí/can one be female],\nbut only Master Niè says *\"能無雌\"* [néng wú cí/can one avoid being female].\nYet judging from the context above and below,\n*\"無雌\"* [wú cí/avoid being female] aligns more smoothly with the meaning.\nSome say: *\"雌\"* [cí/female] is stillness without stagnation—\nthus *\"無雌\"* [wú cí/avoid being female].\nOthers say: *\"無雌\"* [wú cí/avoid being female] means\nno yin perversity to intervene—\nthis also makes sense.\n\nClear and open in all directions—\ncan one avoid knowing?\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nClear and open in all directions—\nthis is awakening, this is illumination.\nIf one can be as if without knowing,\nthen one awakens yet does not illuminate,\nsees yet remains constantly still—\nthis is what is called *\"無知\"* [wú zhī/avoid knowing] as true knowing.\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\nBy nature, Heaven is luminous and transparent,\nits light extending to the four horizons,\nilluminating the eight extremes.\nSubstantial yet appearing empty,\npresent yet appearing absent—\nits wisdom encompasses all things,\nyet returns wisdom to foolishness,\nits brightness surpasses the three luminaries,\nyet returns to darkness.\nMaking people act daily without knowing—\nthus it is said: *\"明四達\"* [míng sì dá/clear and open in all directions],\ncan one avoid knowing?\n\n○ Master Lín said:\nClear and open in all directions—\nomniscient, yet taking *\"無知\"* [wú zhī/avoid knowing] as knowing,\nthen one can embrace the One.\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nExcluding sharpness, screening out wisdom,\nharmonizing light with dust.\n\nTo nurture and store life—\nto give birth without possessing,\nto act without relying,\nto grow without dominating—\nthis is called **玄德** [xuándé/mysterious virtue].\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nIf one does not act in two ways toward things,\nthen one’s ability to give birth to things is unfathomable.\nThe Sage models himself after Heaven and Earth,\nloving and nurturing all things—\nto give birth is the Dao,\nto store is virtue.\nThough giving birth and not giving birth are the same,\nthough acting and not acting are the same,\nthough being an instrument of growth and not growing are the same—\nthe utmost emptiness, the extreme of stillness,\nthe mysterious virtue of Heaven—\nhow could one cling to, rely on, or dominate,\nand burden the wondrous virtue of the mysterious?\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nTo nurture and store life,\nwithout possessing, without relying, without dominating—\nthis is to forget one’s own origins.\n\n○ Master Wú said:\nTo give birth—\nthough one gives birth, in truth there is no mind in giving birth,\nthus it is said: *\"不有\"* [bù yǒu/not possessing].\nTo store—\nthough one acts, in truth there is no mind in acting,\nthus it is said: *\"不恃\"* [bù shì/not relying].\nLike an official in charge—\nthough one governs the people, in truth there is no mind in governing,\nthus it is said: *\"不宰\"* [bù zǎi/not dominating].\nThis is how one attains the mysterious and unfathomable virtue.\n\n○ Master Lín said:\nTo nurture and store life—\nthis speaks of the transformations between creation and nurturing all things.\nCreation and nurturing never rely on this as having,\nnever rely on this as ability—\nthough one is the longest of all things,\none never has the mind to dominate all things.\nOnly then can it be called the mysterious and profound virtue.\nThe intent of this chapter\nlargely centers on *\"無為而為\"* [wú wéi ér wéi/non-action as action],\nnatural and effortless.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\nThirty spokes converge to form a single hub,\nyet when the space between them is empty,\nthe use of the wheel arises.\nMold clay into a vessel,\nyet when the space within it is empty,\nthe use of the vessel arises.\nPierce doors and windows to make a room,\nyet when the space within it is empty,\nthe use of the room arises.\nThus, having is for utility,\nbut emptiness is for function.\n\nMaster Lǐ said:\nWhen spokes converge with the hub,\nit is for the wheel’s practical utility—\nthis is like gathering all dharmas into the mind,\nand the wondrous completeness of the spirit.\nWithout spokes converging with the hub,\nhow could it be called a wheel?\nWithout dharmas converging with the mind,\nthere is no way for the spirit to pass through.\nThe hub is hollow within,\nso the wheel can move and run.\nThe mind is hollow within,\nso the spirit can transform and adapt.\nThus, emptiness is the true utility,\nand utility is the empty function.\nEmptiness and utility interpenetrate,\nfree from obstruction in coming and going—\nthis is the essence of the previous chapter’s teaching on storing and nurturing the vital essence.\nWhen there is nothing to store,\nspokes and hub are both forgotten,\nand the wheel returns to non-being—\njust as when mind and dharmas are both forgotten,\nthe spirit returns to emptiness.\nThe same principle applies to vessels and rooms.\n\nMaster Wú said:\nSpokes are the rims of the wheel,\nthe hub is its center,\nand emptiness refers to the hollow space within.\n*Cao* (埏) means blending clay,\nand *zhi* (埴) is the sticky portion of clay.\nHaving this wheel, this vessel, this room—\nall are for the benefit of the world,\nso it is said: *\"having is for utility.\"*\nWheels, vessels, and rooms all rely on their inner emptiness for function,\nso it is said: *\"emptiness is for utility.\"*\nA person’s solid body contains *qi*,\nwhich sustains life—this is called *\"utility.\"*\nA hollow mind contains nothing,\nyet it is the source of *qi*—this is called *\"utility.\"*\nThus, these two aspects are used as analogies.\n\nMaster Lín said:\nAll three are metaphors—\nemptiness is their function,\nwhile wheels, vessels, and rooms are solid utilities.\nYet the very reason they become wheels, vessels, or rooms\nlies in their emptiness within.\nThis metaphor vividly illustrates the character *\"wu\"* (無),\na stroke of ingenious insight.\n\nMaster Lǚ said:\nThe wheel moves because of its emptiness,\nthe vessel holds because of its emptiness,\nand the room is spacious because of its emptiness.\nBy elaborating on these three aspects,\nit is valued to use things as analogies for oneself.\nTo preserve what is, one must rely on vessels,\nbut to preserve what is not, one must rely on the Dao.\nThe perfected one assumes the form of what is\nwhile refining the spirit of what is not.\nWithout what is, there is no way to apply its utility,\nwithout what is not, there is no way to achieve its function.\nThe form is for preserving life’s utility,\nwhile emptiness is for attaining the spirit’s function.\nAction is for the utility of things,\nnon-action is for the utility of function.\n\nMaster Hé said:\nWhat is solid cannot be used by what is solid—\nthis refers to the form.\nYet the form is used by emptiness—\nthis refers to the spirit.\nThe hub, with its single hollow aperture,\nmoves the multitude of thirty spokes—\nis it the wheel itself that is the wheel?\nNo, it is the wheel’s emptiness that makes it a wheel.\nClay is shaped into a vessel,\nbut if not fired, it quickly decays.\nThe vessel is indeed formed by blending clay,\nyet if its interior is not hollow,\nwhere will things be received?\nIs it the vessel itself that is the vessel?\nNo, it is the vessel’s emptiness that makes it a vessel.\nEven if a palace is beautiful,\nsealed with walls and barriers,\nwhat use is it?\nTo enter the hall, one must pass through the door—\nis it the room itself that is the room?\nNo, it is the room’s emptiness that makes it a room.\nThe body is like a thing,\njust as the wheel, vessel, and room are mere physical implements.\nThe Dao and the mind are like the hub and the window,\npossessing the wondrous clarity of spirit.\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"What is above form is called the Dao,\nwhat is below form is called the instrument.\"*\nIt is not merely that the Dao precedes instruments,\nfor even within a single instrument,\nthe Dao inherently resides.\nWhen people see the instrument’s solid existence,\nI see the Dao’s wondrous emptiness—\nthen, in the midst of boundless utility and empty passage,\nthere is something that transcends the instrument itself.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deaf the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the palate,\ngalloping and hunting make the heart mad,\nrare treasures obstruct moral conduct.\nMaster Lǐ said:\nThis follows upon the previous chapter’s teaching on empty utility—\nwhen one empties utility, one is not dazzled by sounds and colors.\nThus, the five colors blind the eyes,\nfor colors and sounds, flavors and things\nare all *root-dusts* (根尘),\nand all worldly people fall victim to their theft.\nOnly those who follow the Dao do not succumb to deception,\nfor they act only when it is proper—\nthen the six thieves become the six passages.\n\nMaster Lín said:\n*\"Blind the eyes\"* means to be confused by sight,\n*\"deaf the ears\"* means to be confused by hearing,\n*\"dull the palate\"* means to lose the true taste,\n*\"make the heart mad\"* means instability,\nand *\"obstruct moral conduct\"* means hindering virtue.\nThese five aspects all involve indulging in externals\nwhile losing the essence of the inner self.\n\nMaster Lǚ said:\nGazing at colors, listening to tones, tasting flavors—\nall are burdens upon true nature.\nEven before an infant knows its own desires,\nwhat is sound or color,\nwhat is flavor or taste?\nBut once the senses open,\nit knows of green and black hues,\nof the splendor of brocade and embroidery,\nand chases after things in competition,\nunable to penetrate the sight of colorless color.\nWhat difference is there between this and blindness?\nTrue sight is not merely external vision,\nseeing only what is singular—\nonly the perfected one examines the eyes,\nfor they are the sun and moon of *Taiyi* (太乙).\nIn the midst of stillness and emptiness,\none can gather sight and turn the gaze inward,\nwith spirit-light radiant and clear—\neven in the deepest darkness,\none alone sees the dawn.\nHow could this be blindness to the five colors?\n\nWhat are the five tones?\nThey are *gong, shang, jue, zhi, yu* (宮商角徵羽),\nthe sounds of Zheng and Wei music,\nwhich make people indulge in pleasure,\ndisturb their true nature,\nand impair their spiritual clarity.\nUnable to return to the hearing of soundless sound,\nwhat difference is there between this and deafness?\nTrue hearing is not merely external listening,\nbut attaining harmony within.\nOnly the sage discerns the ears,\nfor they are the *listening gates* of the Celestial Sovereign.\nIn profound stillness,\none listens with *qi*—\nthen the celestial resonances hum,\nand the celestial melodies echo,\nsometimes like the sound of gold and jade,\nsometimes like the music of zither and strings.\nOnce this sound is heard,\neven if external winds shake the seas\nor thunder splits the mountains,\none does not hear them—\nhow could this be deafness to the five tones?\n\nThe five flavors—what are they? Sour, bitter, sweet, salty, and spicy.\n\nBoiling the *lin* and butchering the *feng*,\nfeasting on dishes the size of a *fangzhang*,\nexhausting extravagance to its utmost—\nthis makes the tongue indulge in cravings without end,\nclouding the spirit and defiling the true self.\nUnable to taste the flavorless flavor within,\nwhat difference is there between this and *cang*?\n\n*Cang* is loss—\nto taste within is not to crave those external flavors,\nbut to taste one’s own essence alone.\n\nOnly the Perfect One knows the mouth,\nfor it is the crimson well of the Vermilion Palace.\nThus, they nourish the *hángxiè*,\nconsume the *yuying*,\ndrink the *jinyè*,\nand sip the *qiánlí*,\nto irrigate their celestial root.\n\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"Plain and flavorless—heaven’s and humanity’s sustenance.\"*\nWhen the *Zi Dan* presents his dishes—\n*yellow* as the *langgāo* and *yùshuāng*—\nhow could the delicacies of *gāoliáng* ever surpass this?\n\nHunting is the common practice of the state:\nspring searches, summer patrols, autumn hunts, winter expeditions—\nnever missing its season.\n\nBut to indulge in endless revelry,\nto pursue ruinous excess,\nday and night without rest—\nhow could one not drown their true nature in deceit?\n\nThe Perfect One’s inner heart is serene and unmoved,\ncutting off the harm of sounds and profits,\nnot indulging their nature,\nnot flaunting their virtue—\n*Taiyi* is clear and tranquil,\nwhere could wild emotions arise?\n\nAh! The *zhàochéng* pearl,\nthe *liánchéng* jade—\nthe world’s treasures,\nthe people’s prized possessions.\nIf one demands them without restraint,\nexceeding their due,\na single misstep\nwill cause all their conduct to fade and vanish.\n\nThe Perfect One regards all things as *chányì*,\nsees *Sōngyue* as a mere blemish,\nuntainted by desire,\nself-soaring in the Dao—\neven rare treasures could never obstruct their path.\n\n---\n*He Shi* says:\n*\"In the* Zhuangzi*, five colors blind the eyes,\nmaking vision unclear;\nfive tones deafen the ears,\nmaking hearing dull;\nfive flavors corrupt the mouth,\nmaking taste* cang.\n*Rushing and retreating unsettle the heart,\nmaking nature soar wildly—\nthis sentiment aligns with this chapter.*\n\nOnce there was a man who loved hunting,\nclaiming it made one forget death—\nwas this not the madness of the heart?\n\nThere was a man who, at dawn, rushed to the market to seize gold.\nWhen the pursuers questioned him,\nhe said: *\"When taking the gold,\nI saw only gold,\nnot people.\"*\nIs this not a treasure that obstructs one’s path?\n\nThe chapter’s use of *order* and the *Zhuangzi*’s *make* both describe\nhow when things grow heavy, the will grows light;\nhow deep enticement leads to shallow gain—\nunaware, enslaved by others,\nlosing one’s sovereignty.\nPeople do not know the Dao,\nand thus fall to this.\n\n*Cang* is *difference*—loss, not *brightness*.\n\n---\n*Zhào Shi* says:\nIf one does not indulge in the pleasures of ears and eyes,\nnor the delights of mouth and stomach,\nand does not seek gain—\nthen naturally, there will be no loss.\nThus, the sage nourishes the *fù* rather than the *mù*,\nand so discards the former to take the latter.\n\n*Lǐ Shi* says:\nTo nourish the *fù* rather than the *mù*—\nthe inner realm does not stray,\nthe outer realm does not intrude—\nretracting sight, returning hearing.\n\n---\n*Lín Shi* says:\nThe *fù* is the inner self,\nthe *mù* is the outer.\nThe sage attends to the inner and not the outer,\nthus it is said: *discard the former, take the latter.*\nThe former refers to the five above,\nthe latter, the Dao.\n\n---\n*Lǚ Shi* says:\n*Kūn* is the *fù*, bearing all things,\n*Lí* is the *mù*, gazing outward.\nThe *fù* has capacity,\nreceiving within to nourish its substance.\nWhen *Dao-qi* is full and surging,\nthe inner self is whole in spirit.\n\nThe *mù* perceives the outer,\nfixating on all colors,\ndisturbing the true dwelling.\nThus, the sage cultivates the inner,\nnot the outer,\nseeking within rather than without.\n\nRetracting sight, returning hearing—\nrestoring the command, returning to origin—\ndiscarding the spirit of the *mù*,\ntaking the essence of the *fù*—\nthus it is said: *discard the former, take the latter.*\n\n---\n*He Shi* says:\nTo indulge the emotions exhausts the spirit,\nto adorn the outer harms the inner.\nThus, to nourish the *fù* is to focus solely on the inner,\nwhile to indulge the *mù* is to let the outer dominate—\nthe eyes see, the heart moves.\nMany things can lure one away,\nbut if forgotten by the *mù*, light overflows without bound.\nIf the *fù* is filled, there is a master within.\nTo take this is the Dao;\nto discard that is the world.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirteen**\n*Honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks,*\n*great calamities are like threats to one’s life.*\n\n*Lǚ Shi* says:\nHonors and humiliations are the natural course of gain and loss,\nwhile the *yòushēn* is the greatest calamity to true nature.\nHonor is followed by humiliation,\nhumiliation arises from honor.\n\nFine titles and rich emoluments,\nsilk robes and jade food—\nthese are indeed grounds for honor,\nyet when they come, one rejoices,\nwhen they depart, one grieves,\nand humiliations abound—\nhow could this not be shocking?\nThus it is said: *honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks.*\n\nThe body is not inherently noble;\nwhat is noble is *xìng* and *mìng*.\nHumanity is not inherently plagued by calamity;\nwhat is calamitious is *dé* and *shī*.\nThus, in life,\none stumbles upon cold and heat,\nentangles in right and wrong,\nis constrained by fear and urgency,\nstruggles in advance and retreat.\nIf one only worries over gains and losses from external things,\nit is as if one abandons the calamities of true nature upon the body—\nthus it is said: *great calamities are like threats to one’s life.*\n\n---\n*Wú Shi* says:\n*Noble* means *weighty*—\nwealth and riches are considered great benefits,\nyet in truth, they are great calamities.\nThus, those who know the Dao do not prize them,\nwhile those who prize them are ensnared by them—\n*ensnared* meaning unable to extricate themselves,\nand thus burdened by them.\n\nWhat is meant by *honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks*?\nHonor is lowly—\nto receive it is shocking,\nto lose it is shocking—\nthis is called *honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks.*\n\n*Lǚ Shi* says:\nWhat are honors and humiliations?\nAre they not the sway of kin and authority,\nbending the body and lowering the head,\nrefining speech and waiting for opportunity,\nhoping for praise and elevation,\nspirit and breath in harmony,\nnursing the remnants of wine,\nlistening and obeying—\nthis is called *honor*?\n\nOnce honor is received,\none is placed among those who serve,\nalways fearing its loss—\nhow could one not be its subordinate?\nThus it is said: *honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks*—\nhonor is lowly.\n\nYet honor is the root of humiliation, and fortune the seed of calamity.\nWhen honor descends upon one,\nit comes with lofty carriages and four steeds,\ntowering halls and carved walls,\njades at the girdle and chimes at the belt,\nrank elevated to its utmost,\nfavor extending to one’s descendants—\nnothing is withheld.\nOnce obtained, one rejoices as if struck by shock.\n\nWhen humiliation arrives,\nsuddenly grace wanes and favor fades,\nslander spreads like seeping moisture,\nmorning whispers turn to evening dismissal,\ndeep blame and heavy punishment follow—\ncalamity comes without turning back.\nOne loses it abruptly, trembling as if struck by shock.\nThus, one honor and one humiliation,\nlike shadow following form,\nboth are causes for shock.\n\nOnly the Sage is not enslaved by form.\nHe regards honor as humiliation,\nflees fame and abandons the world,\npreserves his body and avoids harm,\nequalizes praise and blame,\nunifies life and death,\ndoes not scheme externally,\ndoes not fret internally,\ndoes not indulge his will in high rank,\ndoes not conform to vulgarity in poverty.\nLooking back on gains and losses of honor and humiliation—\nhow could they shock him?\n\n**He Shi says:**\nWhat is meant by *honor and humiliation*?\nHonor is lowly—\nfor when fame arises, slander follows—\nthis is called lowly.\nHigh office brings danger—\nthis too is lowly.\nHonor itself is lowly;\nto obtain it is to lose—\nfor one knows its lowliness without waiting for humiliation.\n\n**Lin Shi says:**\nThis is the meaning of *fearing gain and fearing loss*.\n\nWhat is meant by *treating great calamity as one’s own body*?\nThe reason I have great calamity\nis that I have a body.\nBut when I have no body,\nwhat calamity do I have?\n**Lü Shi says:**\nWhat the world values as *treating great calamity as one’s own body*\nis this: when a person is born,\nhe shares the same root as Heaven and Earth,\nand all things draw sustenance from it.\nThe petty man pursues profit,\nthe scholar pursues fame—\nthough their power and influence differ,\nto have a body makes them one in this regard.\nThe world says that without a body, there is no calamity—\nthis is to lose the Master’s intent.\n\nHow could the Perfect Man’s *great calamity of having a body*\nmean abandoning form and losing his physical self,\nsinking into dull emptiness?\nIt means he is ensnared by things and fixated on self,\nnot embodying the Dao.\n\nThus, his heart is like dead ashes,\nhis form like withered wood—\nthough honored, he is not humiliated;\nthough humiliated, he has no calamity.\nHe transcends his body as if it were not his,\nforgets his mind as if it were not his,\ndiscards illusion and attains the eternal truth,\nabandons awareness and sits in forgetfulness.\nThen the jade talisman preserves his spirit,\nthe golden elixir refines his form—\nform and spirit both attain marvelous harmony,\nmerging with the Dao’s true essence.\nNo longer afflicted by having a body,\nhow could he suffer great calamity?\n\n**He Shi says:**\nWhat is meant by *treating great calamity as one’s own body*?\n*Noble* means *weighty*—\nthe body is a great calamity,\nworthy of weighty regard, not to be treated lightly.\nThe body is small, yet the calamity is great;\nwhen the body is forgotten, calamity ceases—\nthis is clear.\nThus it is said:\nEars and eyes, sounds and colors—\nthese are the child’s lingering debts.\nThe nose and mouth crave fragrance and flavor—\nthese are sources of resentment.\nThe body is the root of vexation:\npain, itching, cold, heat—\nbecause I am bound to the body, I know great calamity.\nYet once formed, I cannot suddenly make it cease to be a source of calamity—\nwhat benefit is there?\nThe Sage summarizes this in one phrase:\n*Transcend the body while the body exists.*\nWhy not consider that form is not mine to possess,\nthat name is not mine to retain?\nWhat I am born from\ncomes from the natural void—\nstructured by *qi* and taking shape.\nThus, though I receive form,\nthe form is not mine.\nForm is lent to me as form,\nshown to me as appearance.\nTherefore, those who attain the Dao\ntranscend the physical frame to conquer themselves,\ntransforming their essence and cultivating purity,\ndiligently practicing the Dao of boundless formlessness—\nthen what others fear,\nI have no fear of.\n\nMoreover, the body is indeed the root of calamity,\nyet having a body means having things—\nthis is what invites calamity.\n**Liezi said:**\n*The body is not mine to possess.*\nThough born, I must preserve it—\nthings are not mine to possess,\nthough I have them, I must abandon them.\nThe body is the master of life,\nthings are the master of nourishment—\nthough I preserve my body,\nI cannot possess it;\nthough I do not abandon things,\nI cannot possess them.\nTo possess things and the body\nis to arrogantly claim Heaven’s body and Heaven’s things—\nhow could such a one be a Sage?\n\nTo make Heaven’s body and Heaven’s things public—\nthis means not claiming them as one’s own,\nbut offering them to the world—\nthen the body can be forgotten,\nand calamity can be forgotten.\n\nThus, to honor the body as the world’s\nis to entrust it to the world.\nTo love the body as the world’s\nis to commit it to the world.\n**Wu Shi says:**\nThe Son of Heaven’s eminence,\nthe wealth of the Four Seas—\nall stem from treating the body as the world’s.\nThose who know the Dao\ncherish and treasure this body,\nnot daring to use it for the world’s sake,\npreferring to have no world rather than lightly use their body.\nOnly thus can they be entrusted with the world.\n*Entrust* is like entrusting a command over a hundred *li*;\n*commit* is like committing a six-foot orphan.\nShun and Yu held the world yet did not possess it—\nthus the succession of Tang and Yu.\nThose who take honor and humiliation as glory,\nwho value great calamity as great profit—\nthese are vulgar men.\nHow could one entrust the world to them?\n\n**He Shi says:**\nIf one values and loves this body more than the world itself,\nsuch a person will not be moved by the world,\nand thus can be entrusted with its care.\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\n*The true Dao governs the body;\nits coarse husk governs the world.*\nYet today’s common scholars\noften endanger their bodies and abandon life for things—\nis this not tragic?\nThis is like the parable of the *hidden pearl used to strike a sparrow.*\n\n**Lin Shi says:**\nThe words *entrust* and *commit*\nimply the world is not possessed.\n\n**Dong Shi says:**\nThis chapter clarifies the abandonment of false emotions\nand restores true nature.\nIt says:\nAbandon honor, and humiliation will not reach you;\nforget the body, and calamity will not come.\nThe world is a great thing—\nyet it is not a burden.\nWhat of lesser things?\n\n**Chapter Fourteen.**\n\nThe unseen is called *yí* (平),\nthe unheard is called *xī* (希),\nthe untouchable is called *wēi* (微).\nThese three cannot be grasped or questioned,\nthus they merge into one.\n\n**Lin Shi says:**\nThis chapter describes the Dao’s unapproachable nature.\n*Yí* means level—flat, without trace, hence unseen.\n*Xī* and *wēi* imply what is faint and invisible.\nThe three terms, though distinct in name,\nall depict the Dao’s inability to be heard, seen, or seized.\n*Bó* means \"to grasp.\"\nThese three—*yí, xī, wēi*—\nthough named, cannot be distinguished,\nfor they are all the Dao itself.\n\n**Wu Shi says:**\n*Yí* means level and flat—\nlevel, it vanishes without trace, hence unseen.\n*Xī* means sparse—\nsparse, it leaves gaps with no sound, hence unheard.\n*Wēi* means faint—\nfaint, it is dim and boundless, hence untouchable.\nThough one might strive to describe *yí, xī, wēi*,\nthe words fail—\nthus they merge indistinguishably into one.\n\n**Lü Shi says:**\nThe colorless color—\neven if Zhīzhū or Zhīyǔ sharpened their eyes at noon,\nrubbed their brows, and strained to gaze,\nthey would see nothing.\nThe soundless sound—\neven if Zhīyú or Shīguāng cupped their ears at night,\nleaned forward, and listened intently,\nthey would hear nothing.\nThe shapeless form—\neven if Guìyù or Wǔdīng strained their strength,\nclenched their fists, and lunged with all their might,\nthey could not grasp it.\nEyes find no light to illuminate,\nears find no sound to perceive,\nhands find no form to seize—\nthus it is called *yí*, *xī*, *wēi*.\nThough named differently,\nin essence, they are one.\nLike all sounds merging into one wind yet differing in tone,\nor seven orifices sharing the same *qi* yet serving distinct functions—\nthese three cannot be grasped or questioned,\nthus they merge into one.\nYet when considered together,\nthey blend seamlessly as one,\nso that though sight, hearing, and touch are applied,\nthey remain indistinguishable.\n\nIts upper reaches are not bright,\nits lower depths are not dark.\nEndless and nameless,\nit returns to nothing—\nthis is called the form of no-form,\nthe image of no-image—\nthis is called *hūhuǎng* (惚恍).\n\n**Lin Shi says:**\n\"Not bright\" means not illuminated,\n\"Not dark\" means not obscured.\n\"Upper\" and \"lower\" are not to be confined—\nonly that this Dao is neither seen above nor below.\n*Shéngshéng* (绳绳) means \"prolific.\"\nProlific yet nameless,\nits end returns to nothing—\nthus it is the form of no-form,\nthe image of no-image—\nalso *hūhuǎng*.\n\n**Wu Shi says:**\n\"Upper\" and \"lower\" refer to what the *Yijing* calls\n\"form above form\" and \"form below form.\"\n*Shéngshéng* means \"continuous without interruption.\"\n*Fù* means \"to return.\"\n\"Without substance\" refers to the Dao—\nreturning to its origin,\nit aligns with the Dao of nothingness,\nas in *Zhuangzi*’s \"virtue reaching back to its beginning.\"\nThe Dao has no substance,\nyet its form and image are not like those of things—\nthus \"form of no-form,\" \"image of no-image.\"\nIt seems both present and absent—\nhence *hūhuǎng*.\n\n**Lü Shi says:**\nAll shaped and colored things have limits,\nbut the Dao precedes Heaven and Earth,\nendures from ancient to modern times.\nIt disperses as *chōngqì* (冲气),\nspreads as the *tàixū* (太虚),\ncoexists with the Two Principles (yin-yang),\nyet its brilliance does not dazzle—\nsuddenly, it rests beneath the nine depths,\nhidden like tiles and rubble,\nyet its obscurity is not dim.\nIt cycles endlessly, unbroken,\ncontinuous without end,\nnameless, untraceable,\nits virtue complete yet unseen.\nThough one might try to liken it to things,\nit cannot be—\nthus \"its upper reaches are not bright,\nits lower depths are not dark.\"\nEndless and nameless,\nit returns to nothing—\nvast yet solemn,\ndeep yet unfathomable,\nbeyond comparison or measure.\nWithin the formless,\nthere is the form of no-form;\nwithin the nothing,\nthere is the image of no-image.\nIf one says it has form,\nwhat form does it truly have?\nIf one says it lacks image,\nwhat image does it truly lack?\nThus it is said:\nMysterious presence without presence,\ntrue absence without absence—\n*hūhuǎng*, ethereal and misty,\nindeterminate between presence and absence—\nhence \"form of no-form,\" \"image of no-image,\" *hūhuǎng*.\n\nApproach it, and you see no head;\nfollow it, and you see no tail.\nHold fast to the ancient Dao\nto govern the present.\n\n「To know the ancient beginning is called *Dao*’s principle.\n\nLin Shi says: To approach it and see no head is its beginningless nature. To follow it and see no tail is its endless nature. To hold fast to the ancient *Dao* is to speak of its emergence from nothingness. By grasping its original nothingness to govern the present, one may then comprehend the *Dao* of the ancient beginning.\n\n*Ji* means \"principle and order.\" *Dao ji* is akin to \"human principle,\" or the fundamental *Way* of kingship.\n\n○ Wu Shi says: Because it is *hūhuǎng* and indeterminate, neither approaching nor following can reveal its limits. The ancient is what precedes, the present is what follows. All things originate from the *Dao*, hence \"to hold fast to the ancient *Dao* to govern the present.\"\n\nThe ancient beginning is the *Dao*.\n\n○ He Shi says: From \"to hold fast to the ancient *Dao*\" onward, this passage exhausts the theme of \"no beginning, no end,\" yet introduces the character \"have\" (*you*), thereby showing that though myriad transformations differ, one may govern all by holding fast to the One. The *Dao* governs and the king rules—great measures are not severed—all rooted in the ultimate *wu* (nothingness).\n\nThe Classic says: \"Hold fast to the great image, and all under heaven will follow.\" Indeed, one cannot govern *you* (having) without *wu* (nothingness) governing it. The \"holding\" is to take this and proceed.\n\n*End of Volume Two of the Collected Meanings of the Dao-De Jing*\n*Beginning of Volume Three of the Collected Meanings of the Dao-De Jing*」\n\n**Chapter Fifteen of the *Jade Decisions of the Wu River*: The Ancient Virtuous Scholar**\n\nThe ancient virtuous scholar was subtle, mysterious, and profound—so deep as to be unknowable.\nOnly because he was unknowable did he feign outward forms.\n\n○ **Master Wu** says: *\"Scholar\"* refers to one who embodies the *Dao*. *\"Edging through\"* means *communing*—one who penetrates the mysteries of all things is without limit in his profundity. Subtle yet not manifest, his communion is profound and hard to discern, like the depths of water beyond measure. His depths are unfathomable, so he feigns outward semblances to show others. The seven descriptions below are these.\n\n○ **Master Lin** says: This chapter depicts the virtuous scholar, profound in the *Dao*, yet beyond all recognition. His heart is empty, unknowing—his outward bearing arises from no contrivance, hence *\"feigning outward forms.\"* From *\"joyous as\"* onward, this is the true depiction of the virtuous one’s bearing—most refined.\n\n○ **Master He** says: The scholar’s *Dao* is subtle and mysterious, elusive and unobstructed—who could fathom it? Since it lies beyond perception, even naming it is a forced analogy, hence the comparisons below.\n\nJoyous as one crossing a river in winter,\nHesitant as one fearing four neighbors,\nSolemn as a guest,\nDissolving as ice about to thaw,\nThick as uncarved wood,\nVast as a valley,\nMuddled as turbid water.\n\n○ **Master Wu** says: *\"Joyous\"* and *\"hesitant\"* are names of beasts—*\"joyous\"* belongs to the elephant clan, *\"hesitant\"* to the puppy. The elephant knows ahead but moves cautiously; the puppy follows then turns back, hence *\"hesitant\"* means lingering without progress. Crossing in winter is fearful of cold; fearing four neighbors is wary of enemies—thus, the scholar does not dare lead the world, and his bearing is such.\n\n*\"Solemn\"*—dignified and composed.\n*\"As a guest\"*—following without presuming.\n*\"Dissolving\"*—scattered and unfixed.\n*\"As ice about to thaw\"*—melting yet not clinging.\n*\"Thick\"*—sincere and unadorned.\n*\"Uncarved wood\"*—raw material not yet shaped.\n*\"Vast\"*—open and receptive.\n*\"As a valley\"*—empty yet responsive.\n*\"Muddled\"*—unrefined in appearance.\n*\"As turbid water\"*—embracing both beauty and flaw without self-purification.\n\n○ **Master He** says: In the twelfth month, the carts are built, and people do not yet fear crossing rivers. The difficulty of winter crossing mirrors the scholar’s caution—*\"joyous as\"* resembles this. *\"No easy path\"*—ears pressed to walls—this is the fear of four neighbors. The scholar’s secrecy is like *\"hesitant.\"* The host does not inquire, the guest does not act first—the scholar does not lead others, hence *\"solemn as.\"* Water freezes into ice, ice melts back to water—the scholar is unobstructed by things, hence *\"dissolving as.\"* *\"Thick as\"* is like uncut wood not yet divided; *\"vast as\"* is like a valley not yet filled; *\"muddled as\"* is like turbid water receiving filth. Each description vividly portrays the likeness of the virtuous scholar’s *Dao*—hard to exhaust in words.\n\nWho can make turbid water still and gradually clear?\nWho can make the settled gradually move?\n\n○ **Master Wu** says: This follows the *\"muddled\"* of above, asking: *\"Who can make it turbid?\"* Turbidity is the time of motion—when motion follows stillness, clarity emerges gradually. Again, from *\"settled,\"* it asks: *\"Who can make it still?\"* Stillness is the time of rest—when rest gives way to motion, life arises gradually. *\"Settled\"* means steadfast; *\"move\"* means activity. Only because of turbidity does clarity arise; only because of stillness does motion arise. Thus, the vast is not full yet full, the thick is not shaped yet shaped, the dissolving is not fixed yet fixed, the solemn is not the host yet the host, the hesitant is not the first yet the first—this can be understood.\n\n○ **Master He** says: This *Dao* never fails to encompass both essence and function, permeating motion and stillness—it is not mere empty talk. To harmonize its light, to blend with dust, to mingle with the world’s turbidity—yet there is a quiet, detached clarity. To close the mouth, seal the gate—though settled and at rest, there is a sudden, spontaneous vitality. The two *\"gradually\"* emphasize natural, unforced progression. This speaks of how stillness can make turbidity gradually clear, and motion can make the settled gradually vital—motion and stillness in mutual use.\n\n○ **Master Lin** says: These two lines simply mean clarity within turbidity, stillness within motion.\n\nTo preserve this *Dao* is to avoid fullness.\nOnly by avoiding fullness can one embrace decay;\nOnly by embracing decay can one avoid renewal.\n\n○ **Master Wu** says: *\"Renewal\"* means completion. All things decay and become deficient, or renew and become complete. Decay and deficiency are signs of non-fullness; renewal and completion are signs of fullness. Those who preserve this *Dao* do not seek fullness, hence they embrace decay rather than renewal.\n\nThe seven bearings within this chapter are all decaying yet unrenewed.\n\n○ **Master He** says: To preserve this *Dao* is to avoid fullness—this is emptiness. The *Dao* is boundless in its use; sometimes it is not full. Only because it is not full does it contrast with things. While others rush toward renewal and completion, I delight in decay, not hastening toward renewal.\n\n○ **Master Lin** says: *\"Avoid fullness\"* is emptiness; *\"decay\"* is authenticity. To decay without renewal is to remain unchanged for a thousand years as one day—only thus can one achieve the *Dao*’s ultimate fulfillment, hence decay without renewal. *\"Renewal\"* is one phrase; *\"completion\"* is another.\n\n○ **Master Li** says: Building upon the *Dao*’s essence from the previous chapter, it elucidates how later learners preserve sincerity, maintain reverence, and constantly guard their solitude—unfixed by appearances, yet embracing unity, emptiness, and daily practice. Until all attachments are extinguished, all illusions dissolved, until stirred yet not turbid, settled yet not clear—this is the *\"subtle, mysterious, profound, and hidden\"* communion.\n\nChapter Sixteen: **Attain the utmost emptiness, steadfastly guard the utmost stillness.**\n\n○ **Master Wu** says: *\"Attain\"* is the process of reaching the utmost degree. *\"Emptiness\"* refers to the absence of substance, where external things do not penetrate within. *\"Utmost\"* means to exhaust its degree. *\"Guard\"* is to firmly hold within and resist without, like defending a city. *\"Stillness\"* means motionlessness, where the inner mind does not stray outward. *\"Steadfast\"* is the unflagging strength of this stillness.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says: Emptiness upon emptiness, the spirit finds its dwelling; stillness upon stillness, the spirit finds its rectitude. *Liezi* states: *\"Stillness is emptiness; in emptiness, the spirit finds its dwelling.\"* The *Sutra of Xisheng* says: *\"If a person can be empty and without action, they do not seek the Dao, yet the Dao naturally returns to them.\"* ○ **Master He** says: *Liezi* also said, *\"There are those who are born, and those who give birth.\"* Further, *\"To give birth is to return to non-birth.\"* The sage perceives the subtle principle of birth and return: whatever emerges from the *Dao*’s mechanism must reenter it. Thus, I do not swell with all things; I observe how they begin with *Gèn* and must end with *Gèn*. Hence, I remain still and do not follow them together. *\"Return\"* means to abide in the Dao and remain constant. All things, myriad and teeming, each return to their root. Returning to the root is stillness; stillness is the return of life. ○ **Master Wu** says: *\"Myriad and teeming\"* describes the living and growing motion of all things. In spring and summer, the vital *qi* ascends from the roots to the branches and leaves—this is motion. In autumn and winter, the vital *qi* descends from above and returns to the roots—this is stillness. The *qi* of heaven generates life and forms all things, called *mìng* (命). When it returns to its original place of generation, it is called *\"return of life\"* (复命).\n\n○ **Master Lü** says: All things arise from *nature* (性), like the roots of grasses and trees. They manifest through *Zhèn* (震), appear in *Lí* (离), explain in *Duì* (兑), labor in *Kǎn* (坎), and finally return to their roots. Grasses and trees have branches above and roots below, but humans are different: limbs are below, and the root is above—this is the *Níwán Gōng* (泥丸宫). The *Sutra of Yellow Court* (《黄庭经》) calls the brain *\"Níwán\"* (泥丸), the sacred domain of the *Dao*’s essence, where spirit and *qi* converge. If one can observe inwardly here, all spirits will gather, all *qi* will flow, and the *Tāixiān* (胎仙) will be perfected. Hence, *\"All things, myriad and teeming, each return to their root.\"* The noble practitioner who constructs the Dao must begin by exhausting principles, proceed by perfecting nature, and conclude by returning life. None can attain the return of life without exhausting principles and perfecting nature. Now, clarity and openness in all directions—this is exhausting principles. To attain the utmost emptiness and steadfastly guard the utmost stillness—this is perfecting nature. *Guāngchéngzǐ* (广成子) with no seeing, no hearing, embraces the spirit in stillness, and when stillness is steadfast, clarity follows. Your spirit will then guard the form, the form will endure and grow, and enduring growth means life returns.\n\n○ **Master Li** says: To practice emptiness and steadfast stillness, returning life to its root—this is the pure mystery of the spirit. If one attains this with a single, unblinking gaze, the study of a lifetime is complete. *\"Return of life\"* is constancy; knowing constancy is enlightenment. To not know constancy is to act recklessly—disastrous. Knowing constancy brings tolerance; tolerance brings fairness; fairness brings kingship; kingship brings heaven; heaven is the Dao; the Dao is enduring. Thus, one’s life is never in peril. ○ **Master Lin** says: To attain the return of life is to grasp the constancy that does not change. To know the enduring, unchanging Dao—this is enlightenment. Because people do not know this enduring, unchanging Dao, they indulge in reckless thoughts and actions, all of which are disastrous deviations from the Dao. Knowing constancy, one’s heart aligns with the vastness of heaven and earth—what cannot be embraced? Once embrace is achieved, what matter remains unfair? Kingship over all under heaven is this fair Dao. To rule with fairness is to rule with heaven. Heaven is the Dao, hence *\"kingship is heaven; heaven is the Dao.\"* Enduring is constancy; if one attains this constant Dao, their entire life is without deviation—how could there be any peril? ○ **Master He** says: Only by knowing the constant cycle of growth and decay in all things does one grasp the principle of *swelling and waning* (盈虚消息). Thus, one does not cling to minutiae, and *\"constancy becomes tolerance.\"* Knowing that beauty and ugliness, right and wrong can be embraced, one remains boundless and without bias—hence *\"tolerance becomes fairness.\"* Fairness without self-interest is the kingly Dao. Kingship without bounds is the heavenly Dao. Enduring without cessation is the constant Dao of heaven.\n\nThe Dao endures through countless ages without flaw—what peril could there be? This is the ultimate attainment of *emptiness and tranquility* (虚静).\n\n○ **Master Wu** says: Peril refers to endangering oneself. The character *殆* (dai), with the radical *歹* (evil), is glossed as *dangerous*, *near*, or *close*—most words with this radical carry the sense of *death*. Peril is danger approaching death. *没* (mo) means *to perish* or *terminate*.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\nThe *Supreme Sage* (太上) is known only as existing.\nThe next is one whom the people love and praise.\nThe next is one whom the people fear and revile.\n\nWhen virtue/power (信) is insufficient, there arises unbelief.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says: The *Supreme Sage* (太上) is one whose teaching is *wuwei* (无为), whose governance is without exertion, harmonized with the Dao itself—nothing can be added above, hence *\"the Supreme Sage.\"* Though he holds his position, he does not exalt himself, does not value nobility, but lets all things follow their natural course, each settling in its place, like the realm of *Hua Xu* (华胥之国). Thus, the world hears no talk of governance yet governs itself; the people, though aware of their ruler, say *\"What has the Emperor’s power to do with me?\"*\n\nThe *Zhou Shijing* (周诗) states:\n*\"Unknowing and unknowing, they follow the Emperor’s norms\"*—hence *\"the Supreme Sage is known only as existing.\"*\n\nMoreover, in the ancient times, the people used knotted cords for record-keeping, lived in nests, and dwelled in caves, unaware of the passage of seasons or years—this may be called the utmost governance. *Fu Xi* and *Shen Nong* (伏羲神农) emerged, and the people began to till and eat, to weave and wear. They turned toward *ren* and *yi* (仁义), toward *li* and *yue* (礼乐), and the distinctions of praise and blame began to arise.\n\nFor a ruler, if his benevolence extends to the people, those who receive it regard him as a parent; if his righteousness is embraced, they praise him like the sun and moon. The more vivid the principle of love and praise becomes, the farther it strays from the ancient Dao.\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* (《南华经》) says:\n*\"Shun’s conduct was humble, and the people delighted in it\"*—hence *\"the next is one whom the people love and praise.\"*\n\nIn later ages, governance grew artificial and deceitful, *ren* and *yi* were lost, *li* and *yue* abandoned, and the wise and foolish deceived one another. The world declined, yet the Dao persisted through political means, standardized by punishment, and the ruler’s authority was displayed to make the people *cang* (僶, yield) and obey—thus, the people did not fear his might but turned to deceit. When the people deceive, the heart to revile their ruler arises—hence *\"the next is one whom the people fear and revile.\"*\n\nThe *Five Constant Virtues* (五常) take *virtue/power* (信) as their foundation. The *Rú* (鲁) saying declares:\n*\"Without virtue/power, the people cannot stand.\"* When virtue/power is complete, the world is secure; when lost, the world is in peril.\n\nIf *ren* and *yi* (仁义) vie with sincerity, gain and loss follow in turn, and cunning schemes flourish, deceit arises—this is the insufficiency of virtue/power. Once virtue/power is insufficient, the people’s hearts of unbelief emerge. As when the *Zhōu* (周) people established oaths and the people began to rebel—hence *\"when virtue/power is insufficient, there arises unbelief.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lin** says: The *Supreme Sage* (太上) refers to the ancient times. The *lower* (下) means the world below. In the ancient times, the people of the world saw only that their ruler existed, yet all forgot themselves in the Dao’s transformation. Later, the people began to regard their ruler with love and praise. Again later, they began to fear him. Again later, they began to revile him. This shows how the world’s Dao declines ever downward. When the *Supreme Virtue* (上德) decays and virtue/power (诚信) is insufficient, then the people’s hearts of unbelief arise. This is the meaning of *\"the Shang* (商) people made oaths and the people began to rebel; the *Zhou* (周) people established assemblies and the people began to doubt.\"*\n\n○ **Master He** says: When the Sage is above, he embraces the Dao without words, yet his benevolence reaches all things. The officials and courts appear empty, the halls and courts devoid of people—no labor, no wrongful punishments. All under heaven reveres his virtue, and at such times, the people know their ruler yet know nothing else, like fish forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes. This is the Dao of the *Supreme Sage.*\n\nThe next is when the great Dao is abandoned, yet *ren* and *yi* remain—then the ruler and the people are close and praise each other within the framework of *li* and *yue*, like fish nibbling and moistening one another.\n\nThe next is when governance becomes scrutinizing, and the people become wary—then the world begins to fear the law’s severity. Again the next is when laws are established and fraud arises, punishments carried out and deceit flourishes—then the people begin to deceive their ruler, to despise him, and to revile him afterward. This is like fish devouring one another.\n\n*Zhuangzi*, in his insight into the ancient great Dao, saw that morality (道) and virtue (德) were first made clear, then *ren* and *yi* followed, and rewards and punishments were the last concern—he indeed perceived this truth.\n\nThe world’s Dao declines like a river’s current; it is difficult to restore the era when the people said *\"What has the Emperor’s power to do with me?\"* Yet when the *Supreme Sage* and *Way* are mixed with other influences, human hearts follow suit, and thus arise the shifts of affection, fear, respect, and contempt—all stemming from those above. This is the extreme of virtue/power’s insufficiency in moving the people.\n\nAgain it is said: *\"Only when my virtue/power is insufficient do the people doubt me.\"*\n\n○ **Master Li** says: The *Supreme Sage* (太上) cannot but be *wuwei*—this is the teaching of love and praise, the silent instruction. Those who are feared are governed by punishments and prohibitions; those who are reviled are rulers who have lost the people’s virtue/power. When the ruler loses virtue/power among the people, the people do not believe him. *\"Ah, how precious are his words!\"*\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled, the people all say of him: *\"He is but nature.\"* Master Li says: *\"Ah, how precious are his words!\"*—this is the silent instruction. Silent instruction, achieved through *wuwei*, means punishment is not enforced yet the people submit themselves. When his accomplishments and affairs are complete, he returns to simplicity and purity—then love, praise, fear, and revile all fade from the people’s minds. The people dwell in peace and delight in their customs, forgetting their origins, hence *\"the people say of him: ‘He is but nature.’\"*\n\n○ **Master He** says: The Sage’s reason for saying *\"Ah, how precious are his words!\"* is that he dares not use *sheng* (声) and *se* (色, sounds and appearances) to transform the people. Only when he attains the silent instruction of *wuwei* can his deeds be accomplished and affairs settled, through the natural transformation of the people—making them praise him yet not praise themselves—this is how he saves the world’s endless decline.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says: The ancient transformation was rooted in the principle of *wuwei*, in silent instruction alone. Its regard for words was thus: The *Yijing* (《易》) states:\n*\"Without words yet believed, lies in virtue and conduct\"*—thus one knows that the Sage’s single word becomes the law for all under heaven. He himself knows his words are precious, hence he diminishes them again and again, remains silent yet again and again, though he still values his words and does not utter them lightly. Today’s people merely value words, yet they are but empty rhetoric—hence *\"Ah, how precious are his words!\"*\n\n「The ruler of the Dao/Way makes the people improve daily and transform monthly, shifting to goodness and distancing from crime, allowing them to dwell in peace and take joy in their customs, while he governs with ease and observes from afar. The flourishing of the people and the winds of pure transformation can be restored, and when his work is accomplished and affairs settled, the common folk all say that they have found his natural Dao/Way.\n\n**Chapter XVIII:**\nWhen the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, there arise *rényì* (仁義, virtue and righteousness).\nWhen *zhìhuì* (智慧, wisdom) emerges, there arises great deceit.\n**Master Lin** says: When the Great Dao/Way is practiced, *rényì* is inherent within it. Once the names of *rényì* are established, the Dao/Way begins to fade. Hence it is said, *\"When the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, there arises rényì.\"* It is like the sun rising daily, and only then does the deceit and falsehood of the world appear.\n**Master Wu** says: The lower understanding of the previous chapter—that which is known and praised—is the Great Dao/Way. That which is cherished and commended is *rényì*. That which is feared or reviled is *zhìhuì*. From the Great Dao/Way, descending once and then again, already three grades are formed; when *zhìhuì* further transforms into great deceit, there are four grades in total. However, when the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, *rényì* arises, its change is still somewhat gradual. When *zhìhuì* emerges, great deceit swiftly follows, its change is far more abrupt.\n\n**Master Lü** says: The Great Dao/Way is the *wuwei* Dao/Way of antiquity. In its flourishing, *rényì* is practiced within it, yet the people use it without knowing its origin—it is simply the Dao/Way. The Sage’s learning first seeks *dàodé* (道德, virtue/power of the Dao) before *rényì*, whereas the learning of the common world first seeks *rényì* before *dàodé*. Yet they do not realize that *yīnyáng* (陰陽, yin and yang) is the Dao/Way of Heaven, and *gāngróu* (剛柔, firmness and softness) is the Dao/Way of Earth. *Rényì* is the Dao/Way of humankind; its essence was never truly separate from the Dao/Way, nor did the Dao/Way ever abandon *rényì*. How is it that later generations cling to *rényì* as fixed laws, causing the pristine and natural Dao/Way to dwindle, and bringing about the harm of obscuring it? It is far better to conceal *rényì*, discard deceit, return to the origins, and align with nature, then the Dao/Way will not be abandoned.\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"When the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, there arises rényì,\"*\n*\"When wisdom emerges from rényì, thieves and robbers arise from poverty,\"*\n*\"When rényì is hidden, wisdom emerges,\"*\n*\"When wisdom emerges, great deceit arises,\"*\n*\"When wisdom is insufficient, it is followed by deceit.\"*\nHence it is said, *\"When wisdom emerges, there arises great deceit.\"*\n\n**Master He** says: In the *Zhuangzi*’s age of supreme *dàodé*, uprightness is natural yet not known as *rényì*, mutual love is natural yet not known as *rén* (仁, benevolence), sincerity is natural yet not known as *zhōng* (忠, loyalty), fittingness is natural yet not known as *xìn* (信, trustworthiness). Thus actions are performed without trace, and deeds are done without record. From this perspective, the names of *rén*, *yì*, *zhōng*, and *xìn* do not stand, yet their substance remains—this is the age of supreme *dàodé*, the practice of the Great Dao/Way.\n\nWhen the *liúqīn* (六親, six relations of kinship) are not harmonious, there arise filial piety and compassion.\nWhen the state is in chaos and disorder, there arise loyal ministers.»\n\n「Master Lin says: Only when the *liúqīn* (六親) are not harmonious does the name of filial piety arise; only when the state is in chaos and disorder does the name of loyal ministers become known. These two lines are both allegorical.\n\n**Master Wu** says: The *liúqīn* (六親) are father, son, elder and younger brothers, and husband and wife. If respect for rank and seniority follows its proper *Dao/Way*, and there is no discord, then filial piety is merely their natural duty, and they do not recognize it as *xiào* (孝, filial piety). The blind elder (瞽叟) did not act as a father, but when Shun (舜) was acknowledged as the sage-king, only then did the people know of the filial piety of the Great Shun (大舜之孝子). The state belongs to the ruler, and the family belongs to the minister; if the ruler and minister follow their proper *Dao/Way* without chaos or disorder, then loyalty is merely their natural duty, and they do not recognize it as *zhōng* (忠, loyalty). When King Jie (桀) of the Xia (夏) ruled unjustly and evil consorts gathered, only then did the people know of the loyal ministers like Bi Gan (比干) and the Three Ren (三仁).\n\n**Master Lü** says: It is better to let the people transform naturally without governance than to wait for the state to fall into disorder and then display loyal ministers.\n\n**Master Lü** further explains: When King Jie (桀) of the Xia (夏) stood, Longfeng (龙逢) became eminent; when King Zhou (纣) of the Shang (商) perished, Bi Gan (比干) shone forth.\n\nChapter Nineteenth: *\"Abandon the Sage and discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold. Abandon benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness. Abandon cleverness and discard profit, and thieves and robbers will vanish.\"*\n\n**Master Wu** says: *\"Abandon\"* means to reject and not practice; *\"discard\"* means to reject and not employ. The Sage and wisdom refer to *zhìhuì* (智慧, wisdom). Cleverness and profit refer to *dàwěi* (大伪, great deceit).\n\n**Master Lü** says: Form, measure, law, and model—these are the works of the Sage. Strategy, calculation, manipulation, and intrigue—these are the wisdom of the Sage. If one has a mind to practice wisdom, how could they know the utmost wisdom? The Perfect One fears that the people will be confused by the Sage’s wisdom, losing their true nature even more. They value returning to the root, abandoning the Sage’s artifices, discarding wisdom, and letting the people be like innocent children, devoted solely to agriculture and sericulture. The benefit to the people is far beyond a hundredfold, hence the saying: *\"Abandon the Sage and discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.\"*\n\nFilial piety and kindness are the nature of Heaven; benevolence and righteousness are human inclinations. Heaven’s nature arises from spontaneity and cannot be altered. Benevolence, loving all things, makes the people close to it; righteousness, fitting all things, makes the people praise it. When the hearts of closeness and praise arise, the harmony of life and nature is lost. The Perfect One abandons them before they arise and discards them before they become reality, allowing people to return to their original state and restore their natural simplicity. Thus, the *Dao/Way* of filial piety and kindness is complete. Hence the saying: *\"Abandon benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness.\"*\n\nCarving, polishing, and intricate craftsmanship—these are the cleverness of things. Precious gems, jade, measures of grain, and scales of balance—these are the profits of things. If one competes for cleverness, they will not care about shame; if one pursues profit, they will not care about righteousness, giving rise to thieves and robbers. If one can return to their true nature and reside in simplicity, then where would thieves and robbers come from? Hence the saying: *\"Abandon cleverness and discard profit, and thieves and robbers will vanish.\"*\n\n**Master Lin** says: Once the names of the Sage and wisdom arise, the harm to the world follows. It is better to abandon and discard them so that the world naturally benefits. Once the names of benevolence and righteousness arise, distinctions between filial and unfilial, kind and unkind, emerge. It is better to abandon and discard them, forgetting them in the *Dao/Way*, so that all people return to the natural state of filial piety and kindness without distinction. Cleverness and profit give rise to thieves and robbers; it is better to abandon and discard them, as in the saying: *\"Do not value hard-to-obtain goods, so that the people will not steal.\"*\n\n**Master Li** says: This elaborates on the meaning of the previous chapter, where the Sage, wisdom, benevolence, righteousness, cleverness, and profit are all abandoned and discarded, never to be employed again. Then the people will follow their natural transformation and return to simplicity.\n\n**Master Lin** says: Some say that when the Old Master (老氏) abandons benevolence and discards righteousness, does he not contradict Confucius? Indeed, he traces the origin of *Dao/Way* to its source, asserting that though benevolence and righteousness, rites and music, can be used for governance, it is superior to govern the people through the *Dao/Way* and let them forget it in its midst.\n\nThese three teachings are insufficient as mere ornamentation; thus, they are given to those who belong to the realm of *Dao/Way* and *virtue/power*. To see one’s true substance and hold fast to simplicity, to have few thoughts and few desires.\n\n**Master Lü** says: *\"Abandon the Sage and discard wisdom\"* is the first; *\"abandon benevolence and discard righteousness\"* is the second; *\"abandon cleverness and discard profit\"* is the third. All three belong to the sequence of *Dao/Way*, yet they do not obscure its reality.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* cannot be spoken of; any speech about it is merely its semblance. Those who attain understanding hear only its semblance and lose its truth. Though they record it in writing and pass it down through teaching, they still fear that people will doubt its semblance. Thus, it is known but not employed, spoken of but not understood. To discard ornamentation and uphold simplicity, there must be another path to follow, so that doubts dissolve like melting ice. Hence the saying: *\"These three teachings are insufficient as mere ornamentation.\"*\n\n*\"Seeing one’s true substance\"* means purity without admixture. *\"Holding fast to simplicity\"* means stillness and unity without change. To guard oneself with utmost fairness, not to love external beauty—this is having few private inclinations. To practice moderation and control emotions, to be serene and content—this is having few desires. Thus, to govern the state in this manner, one can elevate the people to the realm of benevolence and longevity, the age of *Xīhuáng* (羲皇, the mythical sage-king of antiquity). This is not difficult to achieve.\n\nTo govern oneself in this manner: one’s spirit becomes clear and pure, unaffected by external things—is this not *\"seeing one’s true substance\"*? One’s spirit does not diminish, preserved in the chaos of unity—is this not *\"holding fast to simplicity\"*? In eating, resting, and daily life, there is nothing but fairness and correctness—is this not having few private inclinations? To dwell in the tranquil and distant, severing all entanglements—is this not having few desires? To exchange these for that, what is there to prevent?\n\n**Master He** says: It is not that the Sage’s wisdom, cleverness, and profit cannot be used in the world; rather, their names are mere ornamentation, not their true essence. If the world is allowed to settle in its natural life and nature, then these three can be dispensed with as mere names. The world not settling in its natural life and nature, while people only revere the names of these three and cling to them, is the greatest confusion. Ornamentation is insufficient; if they belong to the realm of *Dao/Way* and *virtue/power*, then it becomes reality. Hence, the Sage says: *\"Those who practice cleverness, wisdom, and the Sage’s ways, I regard them as having cast off the *Dao/Way*. Thus, I harmonize all things without calling it benevolence, bestow blessings upon countless generations without calling it righteousness, cover and load the heavens and earth, carve and fashion all forms without calling it cleverness.\"* Hence the saying: *\"Those who discard benevolence and righteousness are few; those who profit from benevolence and righteousness are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness is merely insincere, and relies on the tools of greedy and acquisitive people.\"* Thus, one person’s judgment benefits the world, but this is merely the false use of benevolence and righteousness. How could this be true benevolence and righteousness? It is far removed from the *Dao/Way*.»\n\n「Yet the common folk fail to grasp its intent, deriding the rejection of the Sage’s ways and abandonment of cleverness as absurd, and scoffing at the abandonment of benevolence and righteousness as a deviation from the norm. Why do they not ponder the *Dao/Way*’s profound purpose, which seeks to guide all under Heaven to cultivate the *Hun-Cheng* (混成) *Dao/Way*? By discarding superficial adornments and returning to simplicity, they may attain their natural state. Hence the saying: *\"Hold steadfast to one and do not mix with another; govern the inner and do not embellish the outer. Clarity enters into emptiness, and non-action returns to primal simplicity. Embrace nature, preserve the spirit.\"* When one’s selfishness and desires diminish, they merge into boundless selflessness and desirelessness. Once purity and sincerity are restored, the *Jiao-Jing* (浇竞) of strife is naturally dispelled. Then, the radiant Sage has no need for artificiality, the subtle *Dao/Way*’s intentions require no contrivance, the benevolence of universal love finds no place to dwell, the righteousness of governance has no need to intervene, and the tools of profit and cleverness are set aside. All under Heaven thus blends harmoniously into the great order. This is the ultimate intent of the Sage’s teachings.\n\nThe common folk are unworthy to recognize this truth—how can they dare to lightly judge it?\n\n○ *Master Wu* said: The people of the *Dao/Way* outwardly appear as plain *xu* (素), inwardly uphold the uncarved *pu* (朴). *Xu* (素) is silk yet to be dyed, *pu* (朴) is wood yet to be shaped. Pure and simple, what need have they of artificiality?\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Absolute Learning and No Worry**\nHow far apart are *\"Absolute Learning\"* and *\"the One and the That\"* (唯之与阿)?\nHow distant are *\"good\"* and *\"evil\"*?\nWhat people fear, one must not fail to fear.\nVast and boundless, its end is beyond reckoning!\n\n○ *Master Li* said: *\"Absolute Learning\"* means abandoning the learning of ordinary people and taking up what they do not learn—rejecting the world’s learning. Common folk are only concerned with learning for practical gain, augmenting their knowledge, ever fearful that their progress in the *Dao/Way* is not precise. The Sage, however, discards all acquisition and solely attends to the flavor of the *Dao/Way*, thus having no worries. *\"How far apart?\"* means they are not distant at all. *\"How distant?\"* means they are too far apart. What people fear, one must not fail to fear—good and evil are indeed things to be feared.\n\n○ *Master He* said: This *\"Absolute Learning\"* is none other than the *Dao/Way*. Natural and effortless, it reaches the point of transcending form and name—this is *\"Absolute Learning\"*. One’s anxieties and thoughts should then be utterly forgotten. Though it is said there is no worry, what then is there to fear? Even without deliberate thought or outward form, one must still hold reverence and caution, for it is the resonance of *\"the One\"* (唯) and *\"the That\"* (阿). How distant they seem, yet in reverence, how slight is the neglect! Good and evil are but a single thought—how vast the divide between beauty and ugliness! *Zhuangzi* says that *\"the beautiful becomes lasting, the evil cannot be rectified\"*—how can one be too careful?\n\nHere, even within *\"no worry\"*, there are things to be feared. Though the Sage forgets the world, they dare not treat it frivolously. Speaking of *\"Absolute Learning and no worry\"*, the forms of *\"no form\"* appear, the sounds of *\"no sound\"* are heard, the tastes of *\"no taste\"* are savored, and the teachings of *\"no speech\"* are imparted. With *\"the whole cow in one’s eye\"*, what is there to worry about?\n\nFrom *\"the One and the That\"* regarding good and evil, the eyes dare not gaze indiscriminately, the ears dare not listen recklessly, the mouth dare not speak falsely, the body dare not move wantonly. To see a louse as large as a chariot wheel—how can one not fear? *Zhuangzi* says: *\"How small it is! Yet this is how it belongs to humanity.\"* This is the saying of those who fear what people fear. *\"How vast it is! Standing alone in its own nature.\"* This is the saying of *\"Absolute Learning and no worry\"*.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* reaches its utmost extent in effortless action, and its breadth is boundless. The *Dao/Way* begins with goodness itself, neither grand nor minute, neither arising nor ceasing. To seek its source, one finds it utterly beyond pursuit—what further use then for one’s mind?\n\n○ *Master Dong* said: It is vast and boundless, with no known limits.\nThe multitude bustles in joy, as if feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat, as if ascending the Spring Terrace to gaze.\nI alone remain tranquil, yet unseen—like an infant before it can laugh.\n○ *Master Wu* said: *\"Bustling in joy\"* is the appearance of harmony and delight. *\"Tranquil\"* is stillness. *\"Unseen\"* is like the faintest crack in a tortoise shell’s divination. The common folk who engage in learning seek pleasure in outward things, like feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat, which delights the palate, or ascending the Spring Terrace to view, which satisfies the eyes. I, however, remain tranquil and still, my desires yet unopened, with no trace of ambition visible—like an infant unable to laugh or smile, entirely unaware of the world’s pleasures.\n\n○ *Master Lin* said: The common folk take joy in the world’s flavors, like feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat or ascending the Spring Terrace to gaze, while I alone find contentment in guarding simplicity and stillness. My thoughts are a hundredfold unformed, like the infant before it can laugh. *\"Unseen\"* is form, is budding—this heart does not bud nor move, hence *\"unseen\"*.\n\nAn infant is born, and a child grows slightly older. The infant’s heart is entirely without knowledge.\n\n○ *Master He* said: The common folk are like those feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat, delighting their senses and bodies, or ascending the Spring Terrace to indulge in unrestrained viewing—bustling in joy, finding ample delight. I, however, am yet unseen, like an infant just born, before reaching the stage of laughter. One cannot perceive my head if they approach me.\n\n*\"Leaning and resting\"* (乘乘兮), as if having nowhere to return.\n○ *Master Wu* said: *\"Leaning and resting\"* means dwelling in things, yet having nowhere to return—it means not clinging to them.\n\n○ *Master He* said: *\"Leaning and resting\"* with nowhere to return—dwelling in things while the mind wanders freely, like riding the wind and treading the void, finding no place to anchor. One follows them without seeing their trail.\n\nIt is also said: *\"Leaning and resting\"* is like riding the wind, like driving the clouds—both are metaphors of riding the wind and harnessing the floating.\n\n○ *Master Lü* said: To blend with the world and move unnoticed, to merge with things and ride their waves, the heart fuses with form, and the body releases its burdens, becoming one with the spirit. Like a hollow boat drifting east and west, or a leaf fluttering high and low, one does not know if the wind rides them or they ride the wind. No one knows where they are going, hence *\"Leaning and resting\"* with nowhere to return.\n\nThe common folk all have excess, while I alone seem abandoned.\n○ *Master Lin* said: The common folk all possess a heart of seeking and filling, while I alone appear to abandon and discard—this means that in my pursuit of the *Dao/Way*, I have no heart of excess.»\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The common folk follow what they know, drowning in wealth and honor, believing they have abundance in their joy. But the Perfect One is not so. He discards fame and profit like chaff, treats high office and lowly matters alike—knowing that both body and world are illusory. His heart is as empty as space, forgetting all things. Thus it is said: *\"The common folk all have excess, while I alone seem abandoned.\"*\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *\"Abandoned\"* means *lost*. The common folk rejoice in their abundance, but I, having nothing, feel a quiet loss.\n\n○ **Master Dong** said: *\"Abandoned\"* means *forgotten*—having yet not having. Oh, how simple-minded I am! Stupid and unknowing.\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The most eloquent in the world do not excel in speech but in silence; the wisest do not excel in cleverness but in foolishness. Those who act foolish all day do so because they do not deplete their spirit.\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *\"Stupid\"* is like the original chaos (*Hun Dun*), dark and indistinct, unable to distinguish—just as in *Zhuangzi*, *\"foolish\"* means without knowledge.\n\n○ **Master Lin** said: *\"Stupid and unknowing\"* describes the undifferentiated chaos. The common folk are bright and discerning, while I alone am dim and confused. The common folk are sharp and probing, while I alone am dull and obscured.\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The common folk expend their spirit outward, dazzling and radiant, seeking only to hear more, to increase their knowledge, to show off their learning—like parading the sun and moon. But the Perfect One’s wisdom encompasses all things, his inner light illuminating like a hidden treasure. Though he wears coarse robes, he holds jade within; outwardly, he lacks brilliance. Thus it is said: *\"The common folk are bright, while I alone am dim.\"* The common folk are strict and rigid, boastful and self-made, clinging to their narrow views, lost in trivialities, scrutinizing the depths of the sea yet unable to stop. But the Perfect One follows Heaven and the Dao, wandering freely, vast and inclusive, beyond measure—dim, silent, and unfathomable. Thus it is said: *\"The common folk are sharp, while I alone am dull.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lin** said: *\"Dim and dull\"* is the same as chaos. The common folk are bright and sharp, while I alone am dim and dull—this is how I differ from them.\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *\"Bright\"* is already clear, *\"sharp\"* even more so. *\"Dim\"* is unclear, *\"dull\"* even more so. The common folk take knowledge for wisdom, but I alone am ignorant and foolish. Drifting like the sea, whirling like endless wind.\n\n○ **Master Lin** said: Like sailing on the vast ocean, the wind howling without end—this is the meaning of *\"Leaning and resting, with nowhere to return.\"*\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: Like floating on the sea, drifting without direction, or the endless wind rising without rest. The common folk all have purpose, but I alone seem stubborn and crude.\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: The common folk all have purpose—that is, they know where they are going. *\"Stubborn\"* means numb like a paralyzed face, unaware of pain. *\"Crude\"* means rustic. I alone am dull and ignorant, like a distant fool. Those who dwell in bustling cities know much, while those in remote, barren places know little.\n\n○ **Master Lin** said: *\"Purpose\"* means *action*. The common folk all act, but I delight in seeking nothing, thus appearing stubborn and crude.\n\n○ **Master Dong** said: *\"Purpose\"* means *use*. *\"Dull\"* means *without knowledge*. *\"Crude\"* means *wild*. All people know the use of what is useful, but not the use of what is useless. I alone differ from them, cherishing to *\"feed at the Mother.\"*\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: This sentence summarizes what came before—from the common fear of excess to my own abandonment, speaking of how scholars strive for many talents, while I alone possess none; from my simple heart to my stubborn crudeness, speaking of how scholars seek much knowledge, while I alone know nothing. Thus I differ from them. What I value is the profound virtue of the Dao—the Dao being the Mother of all things. Thus it is said, *\"Feed at the Mother.\"* To feed at the Mother is like nursing at a wet nurse. Sima [Qian] said: *\"Nurturing the Original Harmony.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lin** said: What makes me different is my taste for the Dao—the Dao, named the Mother of all things. *\"Feed\"* means *taste*. To cherish feeding at the Mother is to value seeking taste in the Dao.\n\n○ **Master Li** said: The Sage abandons all things, attending only to the Dao, feeding at the Mother, guarding the feminine and embracing unity—thus there is no worry.\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The Dao is the root of all things. As fish depend on water—if fish lose their water, they die—what would happen if humans lost the Dao? One must know that spirit is the child of *qi*, and *qi* is the Mother of spirit. Without the Mother’s nourishment, one cannot live; without *qi*’s sustenance, one cannot thrive. Thus it is said, *\"Feed at the Mother.\"* If one continuously draws from this nourishment above and below, then the body will not decay, and the spirit will not be depleted. Hence, *\"Feed at the Mother\"* is most precious.\n\n○ Some say: *\"Purpose\"* is used to explain *\"cherishing to feed at the Mother,\"* but the interpretations differ—how can this be? It is said: Though the words differ, their meaning both return to *tasting the Dao.*\n\n**Chapter 21**\nThe bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The constant Dao is nameless; only virtue reveals it. Supreme virtue has no origin—it arises from following the Dao. The Dao is formless, but when it moves, it becomes virtue, taking shape. Never for a moment departing from the Dao, hence *\"follows only the Dao.\"*\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *\"Great virtue\"* is like abundant virtue. *\"Bearing\"* refers to what exists and is visible. *\"Follows\"* means *conforms to*.\n\n---\n\n**All things derive from virtue.**\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The virtue that gives rise to this manifestation is born from the Dao. The visible forms and *qi* are the *bearing of virtue*.\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *\"Great\"* is indeed *\"abundant.\"* Those who understand the Dao follow it alone, yet even those who see beyond it possess the bearing of great virtue. *\"Virtue\"* (德) means *that which is obtained*—what one obtains within oneself is virtue. Since the Dao is invisible yet virtue is visible, virtue is thus called the *bearing of the Dao*.\n\n**The nature of the Dao** is but *dim and vague*.\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The Dao is obscure and difficult to speak of—what substance can be likened to it? Those who speak of its \"nature\" force a name upon it to probe its profound essence. Since the Dao is formless, from what can it be said to arise? Now, if one seeks the Dao through things, it cannot be obtained; if one seeks the Dao apart from things, it has no boundary. Examining its *dim and vague* essence, one finds that *dim* seems to be *having*—a having within the void—while *vague* seems to be *not having*—a not having within the having. Dwelling in the void is not void, hence *space is form*; dwelling in form is not form, hence *form is space*. Thus, the essence of *dim and vague* can be imagined. Hence it is said: **The nature of the Dao is but dim and vague.**\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *Dim and vague*—having yet not having—cannot be seen. Hence it is said: *dim and vague*. Within the *vague*, there is *form*; within the *dim*, there is *substance*. Within the *obscure* and *profound*, there is *essence*. This essence is most true, within which there is *faith*. Within the *faith*, there is *truth*.\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The *form* within *dim* appears to have form, yet its source is nowhere to be found—thus it cannot be seen, nor can it be heard. If sight and hearing cannot grasp it, how can one measure the *obscure and profound*? To call it *not having* is to say it wondrously encompasses all things; to call it *having* is to say its form cannot be perceived. The *form of the Great Void* is having yet not having—from it, transformation arises, and all things emerge. The *substance of the Great Void* is not having yet having—from it, wind and thunder are born, and frost and dew descend. When there is *form*, the names of things are established; when there is *substance*, they arise from the utmost *essence*. Obscure yet deep and boundless, vast yet silent, *having within the void*, it encompasses the roots of all transformations, conceals the *essence of the Great Void*, and nurtures the *faith of Nature*. Thus all classes of things are born, and the Three Realms are complete. *The Broad Virtue Master* says: **\"The essence of the ultimate Dao is obscure and profound; the extreme of the ultimate Dao is dark and silent. Its origin is such.\"**\n\nThe heart is the palace of *dim and vague*, the kidneys the storehouse of *obscure and profound*. The heart harbors the spirit, the kidneys the *essence*. The *essence and spirit* of the body dwell within the *dim and vague*. Hence it is said: *vague yet obscure*, within which there is *form*; *dim yet vague*, within which there is *substance*; *obscure and profound*, within which there is *essence*. If the *essence* is refined, it weaves through all directions, wondrously uniting the body. In alchemy, it is called the *Great Medicine*; in the *I Ching*, it is called *Central Trust* (中孚). All changes cannot alter it, and Nature cannot displace it. The marvel within marvels, the truth within truths, it responds instantly when stirred—thus it can give birth in spring and cause death in autumn, never failing. Applied to the body, it ascends as *ancestral qi*, circulates as *Yi flow* (沂流), and transforms from yellow to red. Its Dao follows the seasons, hence it is said: **its essence is most true, within which there is faith.**\n\n○ **Master He** said: In ancient times, a scholar of profound mysteries expounded this chapter thus: *\"Form\"* is not always *form*, and *\"essence\"* is not always *essence*. Heaven obtains clarity through it, Earth obtains tranquility, and humanity obtains vitality. Those who can embrace the *mysterious* and hold to the *One*, seeking *essence* in the *obscure and profound* and *substance* in the *dim and vague*, achieve a perfect union of form and spirit with the true Dao. When one speaks of *form*, *substance*, and *essence*, all are within the *dim and vague* and *obscure and profound*—having within the void. Yet it is said that this *essence* is most true, and that there is *faith*—meaning there is no void without having, nor having without void.\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: Former sages spoke of the *void and boundless* without eyes, yet all things stood arrayed within it. From ancient times to the present, its name does not fade, for it surveys all *beauty*.\n\n○ How do I know that all *beauty* is such? **Thus.**\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: Since the dawn of antiquity, down to the present, it has ever existed, manifesting its power in each season. It has never been named, yet we force the name *\"true essence\"* upon it—enduring through the ages, unchanging, it is the eternal nature of the *One*. Sitting and observing the myriad beauties of Heaven and Earth, witnessing life and death’s completion, hence it is said: **from ancient times to the present, its name does not fade, for it surveys all beauty.** Yet all beauty undergoes ceaseless change—how do I know that all things draw their resources and endowments from it? **It is because the Dao reaches everywhere, thus it governs all transformations.**\n\n○ **Master He** said: This Dao precedes Heaven and Earth yet does not endure long; it persists through antiquity yet does not grow old. Though it is ever nameless, its name cannot be erased—this is the *\"Dao of the Constant\"* from the first chapter. It is called the *Dao of the Constant Dao*. Sitting and observing all beauty as it emerges, *beauty* (甫) means *perfection*—all perfection, for the Dao is complete. Hence it is said: **the void and boundless, yet all perfection follows it; this is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the Sage.** How do I know that all perfection is such? **Thus, by this Dao.** To survey all perfection is to survey all principles beneath Heaven—each must pass through the mind.\n\n○ **Master Lin** said: The name of the Dao is present in both ancient and modern times; it cannot be erased for even a day, yet all goodness arises from it. *All perfection* means *all beauty*; *survey* means *to pass through and observe*. All goodness comes and goes through this Dao. **Thus, by this Dao.**\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *\"Does not fade\"* means *eternally preserved*; *survey* is *to pass through*; *beauty* is *perfection*—all things are *beauty*. Yet all things’ beauty varies with time and perishes; only the *Great Virtue*, arising from the Dao, endures from ancient times to the present, unchanging and unperishing. Hence it is said: **from ancient times to the present, its name does not fade, for it surveys all beauty.**\n\nThus, it is so. How could I know that all things’ changes and perishings are without constancy, as they are? **By this Great Virtue’s enduring Dao, I know.**\n\n---\n\n**Dao/Way and Virtue Classic: Collected Meanings, Volume III**\n**Dao/Way and Virtue Classic: Collected Meanings, Volume IV**\n**Chapter XXII of the *Xu Jiang Wei Da You* Collection: \"The Crooked Becomes Whole, the Twisted Becomes Straight\"**\n\nThe **crooked** becomes **whole**,\nThe **twisted** becomes **straight**,\nThe **hollow** becomes **full**,\nThe **ruined** becomes **renewed**,\nThe **few** become **many**,\nThe **many** bring **confusion**.\n\n**Master Lü** said: The Sage hooks deep and reaches far, yet all movement follows principle. Where principle abides, none beneath Heaven can compete with it.\n\n**To cultivate one’s nature**, nothing surpasses *clarity of mind*.\n**To preserve one’s body**, nothing surpasses *avoiding harm*.\nThus, by bending and curving one’s talents,\nBy adjusting speech and silence,\nBy conforming to what is fitting,\nAnd not contending with things,\nOne does not lose the **Great Whole**,\nSo one achieves the **Virtue of Non-Contention**—hence it is said: **The crooked becomes whole**.\n\nThe **keen** and **clear** perceive all things,\nThe **wise** discern their distinctions,\nYet they abandon them without complaint,\nAnd endure adversity without pity.\nTheir **straightness** is like an arrow,\nTheir **truth** is like a taut string.\nEver yielding yet harmonizing with the waves,\nLike the inchworm’s gradual unfolding,\nThey bend and submit without losing their **straightness**—\nThus they may be called **Great Straightness**—hence it is said: **The twisted becomes straight**.\n\nRivers and valleys are **hollow** and low,\nYet water flows toward them.\nThough one might wish not to be **full**,\nIt cannot be avoided.\n\nIn humility and modesty,\nAll **virtues** gather to one—hence it is said: **The hollow becomes full**.\n\nThe **Perfect Sage** fragments his **virtue**,\nRuinously thins his body,\nMakes **Great Whiteness** seem like shame,\nAnd **True Authenticity** appear as flaw—\nThen all beneath Heaven gladly embrace him without tiring.\nHis Dao is ever **renewed**.\n\nThe *Yangzi* [text] asks: **\"How does the ruined become renewed?\"**\nTo **renew** is to **inherit**,\nTo **ruin** is to **augment**—\nThus one may be said to **renew his virtue daily**,\nWithout being harmed by external things—hence it is said: **The ruined becomes renewed**.\n\nThe Dao does not value complexity.\nThe more one hears and sees,\nThe less one adheres to its simplicity.\nThe **easy** is easy to follow,\nThe **simple** is easy to obey—\n**Ease and simplicity** attained,\nAll beneath Heaven’s principles are attained.\n\nThose who **master life’s preservation**,\nWith **few thoughts, few deliberations**,\n**Few desires, few fixations**,\nHold fast without losing—\nThus they attain it—hence it is said: **The few become many**.\n\nHuman nature loves victory,\nAnd prizes excess.\nYet the Dao does not desire excess—\nExcess brings **chaos and disturbance**.\nMany paths lead to lost sheep,\nMany methods lead to lost Dao.\nCultivating the body through **excessive thought** scatters the spirit,\n**Excessive scheming** drowns wisdom—\nThis is not the way to **embrace Unity**—hence it is said: **The many bring confusion**.\n\n**Master He** said: This chapter begins with **the crooked becomes whole** and ends with **whole and restored**—thus one sees the Dao’s **naturally unified Great Whole**, like rivers and valleys to the sea, unobstructed though they twist a million times.\n\nIt is not that the **crooked** can force the **whole**—\nRather, the **Great Whole**’s inherent nature transcends Heaven,\nAnd the **crooked** fulfills its forms.\n\nTo know the **Great Whole** of Heaven and Earth,\nAll is contained within me.\nYielding to things, harmonizing with their waves,\nI act thus in this world—\n**Straightness** cannot be followed directly.\nHow could I ever violate the Dao for empty praise,\nLike those of later ages who despise the **crooked**?\n\nThus, the four quarters are balanced and equal—\nThe Dao’s **straightness** is its core,\nYet **twistedness** preserves its **wholeness**.\nThe six **empties** flow freely—\nThe Dao’s **fullness** is its core,\nYet **hollowness** preserves its **wholeness**—\n**Humility receives benefit**.\nEnduring ancient times without aging—\nThe Dao’s **renewal** is its core,\nYet **ruin** preserves its **wholeness**—\n**Hidden yet clear**.\n\n**The few become many**—**Unity**.\n**The many bring confusion**—**Diversity**.\n\n**Master Lin** said: Only by mastering the **crooked** can one achieve the **whole**,\nOnly by mastering the **twisted** can one achieve the **straight**,\nOnly by mastering the **hollow** can one achieve the **full**,\nOnly by mastering the **ruined** can one achieve the **renewed**,\nOnly by mastering the **few** can one achieve the **many**—\nThese all mean:\nBy embracing **insufficiency**, one achieves **excess**,\nBy embracing **true emptiness**, one achieves **true presence**.\n**The few become many**—\nYet these three words are further refined into two sentences:\n**The few become many, the many bring confusion**.\n\nThus the Sage **embraces Unity** as the model for all beneath Heaven.\n\n**Master Lü** said: **Unity** is humanity’s true nature.\nYet the Dao’s **Unity** has many kinds—\nOne must not fail to know them.\n\nThere is the **Unity** of the Dao,\nThe **Unity** of **non-Unity**.\nThere is the **Unity** of the Spirit,\nThe **Unity** of **True Authenticity**.\nThere is the **Unity** of *qi*,\nThe **Unity** of **One without Unity**.\nThere is the **Unity** of Water,\nThe **Unity** of **Heaven’s One generating Water**.\n\nThis **embrace of Unity** refers to the **Unity** of **True Authenticity**.\nTo know **Unity** is to know **non-Unity**.\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor journeyed to Mount Éméi to meet the **Celestial True Sage**,\nWho said: *\"I beg you to teach the Dao of **True Unity**!\"*\nThe **Celestial True Sage** replied: *\"This is the most profound teaching of the Dao family.\nIts scripture is hidden within the **Five Cities**,\nAnd I have heard it says:\n**Unity** lies within the **Northern Pole’s Great Abyss**,\nWith the **Hall of Brightness** before,\nAnd the **Vermilion Palace** behind.\nMajestic are the **Flowering Canopy**,\nAnd the **Golden Hall’s arched roof**—\nThis is the **True Unity**’s essence.\"*\n\nWhen it speaks of the **Northern Pole’s Great Abyss**,\nIt refers to the **True Unity**’s divine chamber—\nLocated in the **ear’s aperture**,\nBefore the **Hall of Brightness**,\nBehind the **Jade Pillow**,\nBeneath the **Flowering Canopy**,\nAnd above the **Vermilion Palace**—\nThe **Vermilion Palace** is the **Dirt Pellet** [泥丸],\nAnd the **Celestial Sovereign** [天帝] is the **Uppermost Red Child**’s dwelling.\nIt is said the ears belong to the kidneys—\nHence it is the **Northern Pole’s Great Abyss**.\n\nThe *Xisheng Jing* [西升经] states:\n*\"When one attains **Unity**,\nAll affairs are complete.\nKnowing it and acting upon it,\nOne may follow the **True Authenticity**’s method—\nHence it is said: **Embrace Unity as the model for all beneath Heaven**.\"*\n\n**Master He** said: The Sage **embraces Unity** as the world’s model.\n**Unity** is the Dao’s origin—\nThe **Great Whole**’s naturally unified essence.\n\nNot self-displaying, thus **clear**,\nNot self-asserting, thus **manifest**,\nNot self-praising, thus **functional**,\nNot self-exalting, thus **enduring**.\n\nFor only in **non-contention**,\nNone beneath Heaven can contend with it.\n\n**Master Wu** said: **Self-displaying** is like **self-flaunting**,\n**Clear** refers to the **Spirit’s clarity**.\nNot **self-displaying** means\nUsing **obscurity to achieve clarity**.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\n*\"Self-asserting\"* is like *\"self-praising\"*—*\"manifest\"* refers to its illumination.\n*\"Not self-asserting\"* means\nObscure yet ever more luminous.\n\nTo boast of one’s deeds is *\"self-praising\"*—*\"deeds\"* refers to accomplished works.\nTo arrogate one’s superiority is *\"self-exalting\"*—*\"superiority\"* means surpassing others’ abilities.\n\nNot self-displaying, not self-asserting,\nNot self-praising, not self-exalting—\nYet with *\"non-contention\"* as its culmination,\nThese four are all metaphors for *\"non-contention.\"*\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nNot self-displaying, not self-asserting, not self-exalting—\nAll express the intent of *\"not possessing what one possesses.\"*\nIf I contend not with the world,\nThen what is there to contend for?\n\n**Master Li** said:\nFrom *\"not self-displaying\"* onward,\nAll admonish against excess and advocate humility.\nThrough humility and submission,\nThere is no contention—\nThus preserving one’s foundation.\nThe ancients’ saying *\"yielding preserves wholeness\"*—\nWas it mere empty words?\nTruly whole, and thus it returns.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\nThe phrase *\"yielding preserves wholeness\"*—\nWas an ancient saying, which Laozi cited\nAs the opening of this chapter.\nWithin the chapter, *\"Embrace Unity\"* is the guiding thread,\nAnd *\"yielding preserves wholeness\"* below, along with the five *\"non-contention\"* points,\nTotaling ten matters—\nAll encompassed by *\"yielding preserves wholeness.\"*\nThus, it is restated at the chapter’s end:\n*\"The ancients’ saying ‘yielding preserves wholeness’—*\nWas it mere empty speech without substance?\nRather, because it is sincere and complete,\nIts effects return to wholeness.\"*\n\n**Master Dong** said:\nLaozi merely transmitted, not composed—\nSayings like *\"yielding preserves wholeness\"* were ancient texts.\nThis reinforces that his words were not baseless,\nUrging with deep sincerity.\nIf scholars truly grasp the Way of yielding and bending,\nThen the Dao’s completeness and reality\nAll return to them.\nThe Dao is inherently human—\nThus *\"return\"* means restoring to its origin.\n\n---\n**Chapter 23**\n*Rare speech aligns with Nature.*\nA gusting wind does not last the morning,\nA sudden rain does not last the day.\nWho does this?\nThe heavens and the earth.\n\n「The heavens and the earth cannot endure even this,\nYet would humanity die from it?\n**Master He** said:\nThe text states: *\"Listening yet not hearing is called 'rare'\"*—\nThis \"rare\" refers to what?\nIt means *nature* itself, the speech of the Great Dao.\n\nHere, the sentence should end with \"rare\" alone,\nNot to be paired with \"rare speech\" against \"much speech\"—\nThat would be a shallow understanding.\n\nThose who study the Dao/Way cultivate their mind in stillness,\nMerge their *qi* with emptiness,\nBoundless and formless, silent and void,\nThus the opening line speaks of *rare* alone.\n\nThe \"rare\" of the Great Sound—\nThis is *nature* itself.\nSaying *rare*, saying *nature*—\nThis is the mystery of the Dao.\n\nA gusting wind and sudden rain do not last the day—\nGusting winds and sudden rains,\nThese are the *qi* of reckless haste,\nThus they vanish quickly.\n\nThe *qi* of gusting and suddenness is not *nature*,\nThen it cannot endure.\nThe heavens and the earth cannot even endure this,\nYet how much more so for humanity?\n\n**Master Wu** said:\n*\"Listening yet not hearing is called 'rare'\"*—\n\"Rare\" means speechlessness.\nThose who attain the Dao forget speech,\nFollowing only their own *nature*.\nA gusting wind is a violent, swift wind;\nFrom dawn to midday is what is meant by *lasting the morning*.\nSudden rain is a fierce, hasty rain;\nFrom dawn to nightfall is what is meant by *lasting the day*.\nTo act rashly and speak without restraint,\nLike the heavens and the earth’s gusting winds and sudden rains—\nThese are all contrary to *nature*’s constancy,\nBecoming strange and unnatural.\n\nThe heavens and the earth, contrary to *nature*’s constancy,\nCannot endure even this,\nNot even lasting the morning or the day—\nYet how much more so for humanity,\nIf it cannot follow *nature*’s constancy?\nIs this possible?\n\n**Master Li** said:\nGusting winds and sudden rains—\nThis is a metaphor for reckless movement and hasty progress,\nFar from lasting.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nGusting winds and sudden rains—\nThese are metaphors for things that do not last,\nFor the *Tàishàng* warns against\nExcessive joy, anger, sorrow, and delight—\nWhen emotions erupt without measure,\nMovement and stillness lose their proper order.\n\nThe \"rare\" is the Dao/Way of what cannot be seen.\nThus, those who engage in the Dao—\nThe Daoists align with the Dao,\nThose of *virtue/power* align with *virtue/power*,\nAnd those who stray align with loss.»\n\n**Master Wu** said:\nTo engage in the Dao means to take the Dao as one’s affair.\nThe Dao refers to those who possess the Dao,\n*Virtue/power* refers to those who possess *virtue/power*,\nAnd loss refers to the common and lowly.\n\nWhat they do cannot but have some failing.\nThis aligns closely with *Zhuāngzi*’s *Qíwù Lùn* [\"Equating Things\"], which means to harmonize with them, merging as one without contradiction or distinction.\nOnly by following their own nature and speaking rarely can one achieve this,\nSo all—high, middle, and low—are seen as equal, without contradiction or distinction.\n\nIndeed, those of the Dao and *virtue/power*,\nAre one with me,\nAnd mutually verify and confirm each other—\nHow could there be separation?\n\nAs for those of loss,\nThough others may call them lost,\nThey themselves believe they are correct,\nAnd indeed, they have their own natural correctness.\n\nHow could one not follow their own correctness,\nAnd instead rashly speak against it?\n\n*Zhuāngzi* says that silence is equating,\nBut equating with speech is not equating,\nAnd speech with equating is not equating—\nThus, there is no speech,\nWhich is also Laozi’s intent of rare speech, natural harmony, and mysterious unity.\n\n**Master Li** said:\nThose who engage in the Dao\nAre gentle and harmonious in *virtue/power*,\nMerged with all things,\nNaturally resonating and responding to them,\nAnd things naturally responding in kind.\n\nAgain, those of the Dao align with the Dao—\nA unified vision as one body.\nThose of *virtue/power* align with *virtue/power*—\nMeaning they do not harbor dualistic views.\nThose of loss align with loss—\nWithout discrimination.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe Perfect One aligns with the Dao, with *virtue/power*, and with loss,\nYet does not cling to things.\nThey know not of the Dao’s existence,\nNor of *virtue/power*’s existence,\nNor of loss’s existence—\nTranscending the physical and material,\nFree from worries of gain or loss.\n\nThose who align with the Dao,\nThe Dao also finds them.\nThose who align with *virtue/power*,\n*Virtue/power* also finds them.\nThose who align with loss,\nLoss also finds them.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\nThose of *virtue/power*,\nSee me as one with them,\nAnd mutually verify and confirm each other—\nWhat separation could there be?\n\nAs for those of loss,\nThough I see them as one with me,\nPerhaps they cling to their own narrow correctness,\nAnd through this, awaken me to the broader truth—\nThus, all three kinds of people\nConfirm my understanding through their own ways.\n\nYet only those who truly possess the Dao can achieve this.\nIf the Dao’s essence is deficient within oneself,\nThen one’s treatment of others will not reflect its true nature,\nAnd distinctions of right and wrong will be forcibly imposed—\nHow could one achieve such mysterious unity?\n\n**Master Li** said:\nSelf-perception, self-affirmation, self-praise, and self-boasting—\nAll are rooted in private intent.\nPrivate intent solidifies into harm to the public—\nHow could this endure?\n\nThus, those who possess the Dao do not dwell here.\n\"Excess food, superfluous movement\"—\nLike leftover food or parasitic growths,\nThey are what the world despises.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe Perfect One’s Dao-heart is boundless and void,\nThey gaze upon things with playful detachment,\nTreating life and death as a single thread,\nAnd possibility and impossibility as a single continuum.\nThey look back upon those who self-perceive, self-affirm, self-praise, and self-boast—\nLike discarded leftovers or superfluous actions,\nWhat heaven rejects, what earth transforms,\nWhat humanity despises—\nAnd much less so for the Perfect One,\nWho exhausts principles and fathoms nature,\nReaching the pinnacle of the Dao—\nThey never consider such things,\nAnd should avoid them for life.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nSelf-perception, self-affirmation, self-praise, and self-boasting—\nAll are cases of holding onto one’s own while failing to transform.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\nThose who cling to self-perception\nWill never truly be enlightened,\nThose who cling to self-affirmation\nWill never truly shine,\nThose who cling to self-praise\nWill never achieve true merit,\nThose who cling to self-boasting\nWill never have lasting virtue—\nJust as those who stand on tiptoe\nCannot truly stand,\nAnd those who stride too widely\nCannot truly walk.\n\n\"Excess food, superfluous movement\"—\nSome say: *xíng* (行) should be read as *xíng* (形), for ancient characters were interchangeable.\n\n**Master Sima** said:\nDiscard the surplus of food,\nAnd thus one may avoid causing others revulsion.\nRemove the superfluous growths of flesh,\nAnd thus one may avoid causing others ugliness.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five:** There is a thing that blends into unity,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe *Taiyi* (太易) is the state before *qi* (炁) was seen.\nThe *Tai’chu* (太初) is the beginning of *qi*.\nThe *Taishǐ* (太始) is the beginning of form.\nThe *Taìsù* (太素) is the beginning of substance.\nWhen *qi*, form, and substance are all present yet not yet separated,\nIt is called *hùn lún* (浑沦).\nNeither clear nor turbid, it remains serene and ever-present;\nNeither high nor low, it cannot be divided by myriad streams.\nHeaven and earth arise from it,\nAnd all things transform through it.\nThe perfected one embodies it,\nThus returning to the root and recovering the vital breath,\nRestoring one’s original nature to its beginning.\n\nWithin the daze of *huánglǔn* (恍惚),\nTen thousand harmonies merge into one,\nThe true essence of all things is grasped,\nAnd their original form is revealed.\nBefore the heavens and earth were formed,\nBefore the *hún dùn* (混沌) took shape,\nThis is the source of the Dao.\nIn humans, it manifests as the nature of *miào jué* (妙觉),\nEnduring through countless *kālpas* (劫) without interruption.\nHence, it is said: *\"There is a thing that blends into unity,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\"*\n\n**Master Lin** said:\n*\"There is a thing that blends into unity\"*—this is the Dao.\nThe *Wuji* (无极) gives rise to the *Taiji* (太极),\nIts birth precedes that of heaven and earth.\nIt speaks of heaven and earth arising from this Dao.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\n*\"There is a thing that blends into unity\"*—the \"thing\" refers to the Dao,\nAnd \"blends into unity\" means complete without division or distinction.\n*\"Born before heaven and earth\"*—just as the first chapter speaks of *\"the beginning of heaven and earth\"*,\nAnd the fourth chapter speaks of *\"the time before the Emperor of Forms\"* (象帝).\n\nSilent and boundless,\nIt stands alone yet never alters,\nCirculates endlessly yet never falters,\nCapable of being the mother of all under heaven.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nSilent—without sound,\nBoundless—without form.\nEmpty and profound, vast and obscure,\nNeither past nor future,\nStanding alone without counterpart,\nNever changing or transforming—\nWhat could pair with it?\nThus it can traverse the eight *huáng* (纮),\nEndlessly adapt and respond,\nRevolving without error.\nAll things have rise and decline,\nThe Dao knows no limits.\nThings cannot see its movement yet it moves,\nCannot see its rest yet it rests.\nMoving then resting, resting then moving,\nLike an endless ring.\nThings, great or small,\nAll turn toward the Dao.\nObtaining it brings wholeness,\nLosing it brings harm.\nLife and completion depend upon it.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nSilent and boundless—\nIt cannot be seen.\nStanding alone yet never altering—\nIt endures eternally without change.\nCirculating endlessly yet never faltering—\nIt moves with vigor yet never ceases.\nCapable of being the mother of all under heaven—\nThe origin from which all things arise.\nSilent—utter stillness.\nBoundless—vast emptiness.\nIt speaks of its formlessness and soundlessness.\nStanding alone beyond all things,\nWithout equal or opposition,\nYet never varying or transforming—\nHence, *\"never alters.\"*\nCirculating through all things,\nReaching everywhere without end,\nYet never exhausted or failing—\nHence, *\"never falters.\"*\nNurturing all things—\nHence, *\"the mother of all under heaven.\"*\n\nI do not know its name,\nSo I call it *Dao*.\nForcing a name upon it, I call it *Great*.\nGreat—it passes away,\nPassing away—it grows distant,\nDistant—it returns.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nI do not know its name,\nAnd no name can truly capture it.\nSince it cannot be named, I call it *Dao*—\nA substitute name.\nSaying *Dao* is insufficient,\nI force another name upon it—*Great*.\n*Great* is also insufficient,\nSo I name it *Passing* (逝)—\nPassing, like the movement of going,\nCannot be pursued or chased.\n*Passing* is still insufficient,\nSo I force another name upon it—*Distant*.\nDistant—it cannot be approached or clung to.\n*Distant* is still insufficient,\nSo I force another name upon it—*Returning*.\nReturning—it means returning to the root.\n\n**Master Li** said:\n*Great*—without bounds or measure,\n*Passing*—without territory or frontier,\n*Distant*—without limits or edge,\n*Returning*—it gathers and brings back.\n\n**Master He** said:\n*Returning*—it means returning to the state of no-thing.\n\n**Master Chái** said:\n*Returning*—it means the Dao’s use returning to its original body.\n\nHence:\nThe Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nThe Sage is also great.\nWithin the realm, there are four *Great Ones*,\nAnd the Sage is one of them.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\nThe Sage refers to those who hold the position of enlightenment.\nThough the Dao is the greatest of all time,\nNothing can compare to it.\nThis is why, when speaking of heaven, earth, and the Sage in relation to the Dao,\nIt is said there are four *Great Ones*—why?\n\nBecause:\nHeaven obtains this Dao and thus becomes heaven,\nEarth obtains this Dao and thus becomes earth,\nThe Sage obtains this Dao and thus becomes the Sage.\nThis is how they become great—\nBecause they possess this Dao.\n\n**Master Li** said:\nHumans only know of the four *Great Ones* within the realm,\nBut do not realize that their own self is even greater.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe perfected one likens it to oneself.\nThe Dao is the numinous and mysterious void,\nHeaven is the *Shén gōng* (神宫) of the celestial valley,\nEarth is the *Zhēn tǔ* (真土) of the Yellow Court,\nThe Sage is the *Yuán shén* (元神) of true nature.\nThe *Yuán shén*—this is the heart,\nNever departing from the four-square inch space.\nPenetrating heaven and earth,\nSpanning all directions—\nThis too can be called *Great*.\n\nHumans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows *Zìrán* (自然).\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe Sage is profound and silent, like stillness,\nSharing virtue with the *Yīn* (阴).\nIn governing, it shows no partiality—\nThis is following Earth.\nEarth is steadfast and unchanging,\nFirm yet balanced, like the center,\nSharing movement with the *Yáng* (阳).\nThis is following Heaven.\nHeaven is exalted and just,\nRevealing true signs of the Sage,\nResponding to all transformations,\nYet only virtue aids it—\nThis is following the Dao.\nOnly the Dao lets things follow their nature,\nAchieving effortless spontaneity.\nHold fast without losing it,\nAnd it merges with the numinous.\nThe Dao’s body is complete and free-flowing,\nEntering and exiting without hindrance—\nThis is what is meant by *Zìrán*.\nWho could say it is not so?\nThus it is said: *\"Humans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows Zìrán.\"*\n\n**Master Wu** said:\nThe reason humans are great\nIs because they obtain this Dao and align with Earth—\nHence, *\"follow Earth.\"*\nThe reason Earth is great\nIs because it obtains this Dao and aligns with Heaven—\nHence, *\"follow Heaven.\"*\n\n---\n\nHeaven’s greatness lies in its unity with the Dao—\nHence, *\"follow the Dao.\"*\nThe Dao’s greatness lies in its *Zìrán*—\nHence, *\"follow Zìrán.\"*\nThere is no *Zìrán* apart from the Dao—\n*Zìrán* is simply the nameless.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nIts meaning is only that the Dao reaches its utmost in *Zìrán*—\nSuch an exposition may be called a profound theory.\n\n**Master He** said:\nThe \"humans follow Earth\" refers to the Sage.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six**\nThe heavy is the root of the light,\nThe still is the sovereign of the restless.\nThus the Sage never walks a day without his baggage train.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\n*Root* is like *foundation*; *restless* means *movement*.\n*Sovereign* means *master*—\nSpeaking of the light relying on the heavy as its foundation,\nAnd movement being governed by stillness as its master.\n\nThe Sage’s journey:\nWhen traveling in peace, he rides in a light carriage,\nWhen leading an army, he rides in a war chariot—\nBoth are light vehicles.\nBehind the light carriage comes the baggage train,\nCarrying bedding, clothing, food, and supplies—\nThis is the heavy carriage.\n\nThough he rides in a light carriage,\nHe never strays from the heavy baggage train all day,\nNot daring to rush forward in his light carriage\nAnd abandon what follows behind.\n\nThis is what is meant by *\"the light rooted in the heavy.\"*\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe heavy is what bears things,\nThe light is what is borne by things.\nTo govern the light, one must not lose sight of the heavy.\nThe still is what commands things,\nThe restless is what is enslaved by things.\nTo govern the restless, one must not lose sight of the still.\nFor stillness brings the power to control the light,\nAnd stillness provides the means to restrain the restless.\nThus, the ruler of a state\nShould establish depth, weight, and tranquility as his foundation,\nThen the people will be at ease without fear of disorder.\n\nEven as he walks all day,\nHe never dares to leave behind the heavy baggage train—\nFor it contains his clothing and food.\nIf he abandons it and strays far,\nHe risks exhaustion along the way.\nHow could one, in establishing oneself and following the Dao,\nFor even an instant forget stillness and weight?\n\nThe Perfect Man, in his own conduct,\nHolds weight and stillness in highest regard,\nAnd carefully avoids lightness and restlessness.\nThe heavy is the head,\nThe light is the limbs,\nThe still is the spirit,\nThe restless is the emotions.\nTaking the virtue of stillness and weight,\nAnd discarding the emotions of lightness and restlessness,\nThen the sacred embryo rests in ease,\nAnd all day long, he moves as if riding in a comfortable carriage.\n\nThough the Great Dao is smooth,\nHe does not dare to rush forward lightly.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\n*Root* speaks of the light arising from the heavy,\n*Sovereign* speaks of the restless being mastered by stillness.\nThough there are splendid sights to observe,\nHis dwelling is serene and detached.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\n*Burn* means *leisure*; *dwelling* means *residence*.\nEven in realms of honor and splendor,\nWhere one might wander in observation,\nHe remains detached, untethered by any concern—\nThis is what is meant by *\"movement governed by stillness.\"*\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nWhat his mind perceives\nIs the utmost beauty in all under Heaven—\nHence, *\"splendid sights.\"*\nYet he resides in it with ease,\nThus standing beyond lightness, heaviness, restlessness, and stillness.\n*Burn* means *ease*; *dwelling* means *residence*—\nAs in my writings: *\"ease in movement, breadth in dwelling.\"*\n\n**Master He** said:\nThough there are towering heights and splendid sights,\nHis leisure is serene and unburdened—\nNothing in all things can disturb his mind.\nWhat more is there to governing the world?\n\nThe *Listed Child* observed the Dao without seeing—\nThe utmost of stillness and weight.\nHow could a ruler of ten thousand chariots\nMake his body light to the world?\nLightness leads to losing his ministers,\nRestlessness leads to losing his sovereignty.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\nThe state’s power rests on the heavy governing the light,\nMilitary strategy relies on stillness overcoming movement—\nJust as in a person’s cultivation of body and mind,\nOne must root oneself in the heavy\nAnd govern with stillness.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nIf a ruler of ten thousand chariots\nDoes not know his own weight,\nHe cannot stand detached from things.\nHe will inevitably fall into lightness and restlessness.\nLosing his ministers means he cannot subdue the world,\nLosing his sovereignty means he has abandoned what he governs—\nTo make his body light to the world\nIs to treat the world as heavy and himself as light.\nNot to make his body light is to know the Dao,\nAnd to know the Dao is to know *Zìrán*.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nFor the Perfect Man, taking from himself—\nThe heart is the sovereign,\n*Qi* is the minister.\nLightness causes the heart to move and deplete his *qi*,\nRestlessness causes *qi* to dissipate and unsettle the heart.\nInternally, he cultivates himself;\nExternally, he commands things.\nThe body of stillness and weight,\nThe division of nature and principle—\nThus it is said: *\"Lightness leads to losing his ministers,\nRestlessness leads to losing his sovereignty.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven**\nThe adept’s path leaves no tracks,\nThe adept’s speech has no flaws,\nThe adept’s strategy requires no calculations,\nThe adept’s closure needs no locks yet cannot be opened,\nThe adept’s binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\n*\"Shàn\"* means to excel in one’s affairs.\n*\"Zhé\"* refers to the tracks of a chariot.\n*\"Jì\"* means footprints.\n*\"Xiá\"* means flaws or blemishes.\n*\"Zhé\"* means blameworthy errors.\n*\"Jì\"* means the counting of numbers.\n*\"Chóucè\"* are counting rods—calculating tools made of bamboo.\n*\"Guānjué\"* are door-blocking bars: the horizontal piece is called *guān*, the vertical *jué*.\n*\"Shéngyuē\"* means cords: when twisted together they form a rope (*shéng*), when used to bind things they are called *yuē*.\n\nThe traveler must leave tracks upon the earth,\nThe speaker must have flaws that can be pointed to,\nThe calculator must use counting rods,\nThe door-closer must use bars,\nThe binder must use cords.\nYet these are the deeds of ordinary men.\nBut when the Daoist observes them,\nHow could they be called *shàn*?\n\nIndeed, the one who excels in movement\nDoes so by *not* moving and thus leaves no tracks.\nThe one who excels in speech\nDoes so by *not* speaking and thus has no flaws.\nThe one who excels in calculation\nDoes so by *not* calculating and thus needs no rods.\nThe one who excels in closing\nDoes so by *not* closing and thus has no bars—yet what is closed cannot be opened.\nThe one who excels in binding\nDoes so by *not* binding and thus has no cords—yet what is bound cannot be undone.\n\nThese five matters are used as analogies\nTo introduce the idea of the Sage’s excellence in salvation.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe numinous has no fixed form,\nThe Dao has no fixed body.\nIt arrives without movement,\nIt is swift without haste.\nThe Perfect Man observes the Dao of Heaven,\nFollows Heaven’s actions,\nActs through *wuwei* (non-action),\nMoves where nothing moves,\nYet without leaving his courtyard,\nHis virtue spreads and permeates—\nLike wind sweeping through all things,\nWhat tracks could there be to follow?\n\nMoreover, those who cannot speak well\nAre burdened by their words,\nFor it is clear they have not forgotten speech.\nFlaws are the defects of jade,\nErrors are the faults of speech—\nHow could they know the purpose of speech?\nThe Perfect Man, with his virtue of daily renewal,\nExpresses himself in teaching the world,\nHarmonizing with *Zìrán*,\nSo how could there be flaws or blame to mar him?\nThus it is said: *\"The adept’s path leaves no tracks,\nThe adept’s speech has no flaws.\"*\n\nThe Dao cannot be sought through measurements.\nNow, if one uses counting rods to know,\nHow could it be the self-attained mystery?\nBut the adept in calculation is otherwise:\nGuarding the One in *wuwei*,\nHe can embrace all things,\nMoving freely without falling into numbers,\nLetting great and small, many and few,\nEach fulfill their proper measure,\nWithout waste or loss—\nWhat need has he for counting rods?\nThus it is said: *\"The adept’s strategy requires no calculations.\"*\n\nMoreover, the adept in closing\nHas six openings and four exits,\nYet even if Heaven and Earth shift in secrecy,\nGhosts and spirits respond in vain—\nThey cannot find the door,\nNor enter by any means.\nFor his form is whole, his essence restored,\nHis orifices sealed, his gates closed—\nNo realm can penetrate.\nThough no bars are used, it cannot be opened.\nThus it is said: *\"The adept’s closure needs no locks yet cannot be opened.\"*\n\nAh! The adhesion of glues, the congealing of water,\nThe merging of affairs—\nEven without cords, they cannot be undone.\nThe Perfect Man is simple, empty, and boundless,\nHis spirit concentrated, his *qi* settled,\nSerene and tranquil—\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot violate him.\nThus it is said: *\"The adept’s binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone.\"*\n\n**Master Li** said:\nIf one is careful in speech and action,\nThere will be no tracks, no blame.\nThe calculations of the heart—\nCan they be reckoned?\nThe closures of the heart—\nCan they be opened?\nThe bindings of the heart—\nCan they be undone?\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nThese five are all metaphors.\nTheir meaning is simply this:\nIf one takes *Zìrán* as the Dao,\nThere is no force to contain it,\nNo place to advance it.\nThus the Sage always excels in salvation,\nAnd so there is no abandonment of people.\nHe always excels in saving things,\nAnd so there is no abandonment of things—\nThis is called *\"clinging to the bright.\"*\n\n**Master Wu** said:\nThe Sage’s salvation of people and things\nIs to *not* save as salvation—\nJust as in the earlier analogies,\nTo excel is to *not* do the deed.\n\nIndeed, where there is salvation,\nThere must be abandonment.\nSuppose the Sage saves a hundred thousand people,\nA hundred thousand things—\nYet outside that number,\nAll are abandoned and unsaved.\nBut the Sage’s excellence in salvation is otherwise:\nHe saves none at all.\nIf he saves none,\nThen he abandons none.\nOne does not see him saving this while abandoning that,\nSo there is no one abandoned and unsaved,\nNo thing abandoned and unsaved.\n\n**Master He** said:\nThe Dao pervades the world,\nEncompassing all things.\nAll desire to be transformed by it,\nAll desire to be completed by it—\nYet no tracks are seen,\nFor its response is numinous and wondrous.\n\nFrom the *Guān Yīn Zǐ*:\n*\"Dark and dense within the Great Transformation,\nNature is One alone.*\nHe who knows that Nature is One\nHas no self, no other—\nThus all things fulfill their nature without remainder,\nThe Sage’s Dao of *wuwei*—\nThis is called *clinging to the bright.*\"\n\nThe luminous and clear nature\nIs what all share,\nYet it is not fully bright.\nThe Sage guides them with flexibility,\nRestoring their luminous Heaven\nTo an unbroken, undying state—\nThose who follow are the *shàn* (excellents),\nThus it is called *clinging to the bright.*\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe Perfect Man withdraws his gaze, returns his hearing,\nThe empty chamber gives birth to whiteness,\nThe settled space emits light—\nLike a lamp’s brilliance,\nTransmitted without end,\nThus it is called *clinging to the bright.*\n\n**Master Dòng** said:\nTo rescue people in peril\nIs only to rescue their forms—\nAnd even then, it may not be comprehensive.\nHow could this be called *shàn*?\n\nOnly those who cling to *wuwei*,\nLost in their nature’s darkness,\nWhile I possess the capacity to contain them—\nI envelop them with my prior enlightenment,\nAwaken them so their Heavenly light shines forth,\nLike a lamp’s transmission without end—\nThe more I give to others, the more my own brightness grows,\nBoundless in measure.\nThus the *shàn* become teachers for the un-*shàn*,\nAnd the un-*shàn* become resources for the *shàn.*\n\n**Master Wu** said:\nThe *shàn* are those who excel in their affairs.\nA *teacher* is one whom others revere and follow as a model.\nA *resource* is like wealth given to others,\nSo they may rely on it and achieve success.\n\nBecause of their lack of virtue, others attain my reputation for virtue—\nthus it is called *resource*.\n\n**Master He** said:\nThe un-virtuous learn from the virtuous and receive their teachings,\nwhile the virtuous use the un-virtuous as a means to manifest their transformation—\nthis is how the Dao endlessly generates and sustains itself.\nThis is called *transmitting brightness*.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nIf there were no un-virtuous in the world,\nwho would know the virtuous for their virtue?\nThus, the un-virtuous are the *resource* for the virtuous.\n*Resource* means relying on them to distinguish oneself.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\n*Teacher* and *resource* are those who aid others and are also aided in return—\na reciprocal relationship.\n\n**Master Ni** said:\nThat the virtuous are teachers to the un-virtuous is certain,\nbut that the un-virtuous are *resources* for the virtuous—\nConfucius said:\n*\"When three men walk together, there is one I can take as my teacher.\nI follow his virtues and correct my flaws.\"*\nEven Confucius regarded the un-virtuous as teachers.\nHow much more so for the wise?\n\n*Resource* means *aid*—\nby observing their flaws, I reflect and correct my errors to follow virtue.\nThis is called *resource*.\n\nTo not esteem one’s teacher,\nto not cherish one’s *resource*—\neven the wise may be utterly lost.\nThis is called the *ultimate subtlety*.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThough one follows a teacher to find direction,\nupon sudden enlightenment to the ultimate truth,\nsubject and object are forgotten—\nneither esteem nor attachment remains.\nAs in Liezi, who taught by Lao Shang and befriended Boyao,\nlater saying:\n*\"I do not know if my teacher was truly my teacher,\nor if my friend was truly my friend—\nwithin and without, all is complete.\"*\nThus it is said:\nTo not esteem one’s teacher,\nto not cherish one’s *resource*—\nonly then can one perceive the nature of nature,\nopen the Heaven of Heaven,\nand penetrate deeply into the Dao,\nso that even the wise are utterly lost in its crossing.\nThough they devise clever schemes, they find no application;\nthough they speak profound words, they find no understanding.\nThis is truly the *ultimate subtlety*—\nthus it is said:\nEven the wise may be utterly lost,\nthis is called the *ultimate subtlety*.\n\n**Master Li** said:\nForgetting teacher and *resource*,\ndiscarding cleverness and abandoning wisdom,\nacting the fool all day.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight**\nKnow the *heroic* yet hold to the *receptive*—\nbe the valley of the world.\n\nTo be the valley of the world,\never abiding in virtue,\nreturning to the infant.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe *heroic* is strong and active,\nthe *receptive* is gentle and still.\nThe sage knows his own exalted dignity—\nif he indulges in rigid dominance, calamity arises.\nBetter to embrace the yielding and weak,\nto be humble and good at submission,\nso that the world’s virtue returns to him,\nlike water flowing downward.\n\nTo be the valley of the world,\noverflowing like a gentle stream,\nspreading to the four directions—\nwhat cannot it receive?\nYet still maintaining his constant virtue,\npure and unadulterated,\nlike an infant before speech—\nthis is called *perfect virtue*.\nSo too for oneself.\n\nThe *heroic* is the yang within yin,\nin man, the *essence*.\nThe *receptive* is the yin within yang,\nin man, the *spirit*.\nKnowing the *heroic* preserves one’s essence,\nholding to the *receptive* nurtures one’s spirit.\nWhen the spirit is luminous, all things come;\nwhen the heart is empty, harmonious *qi* returns—\nlike water flowing into a valley,\nbearing all filth,\ncomparable to the innocence of a babe.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\n*Heroic* means strong and forceful,\n*receptive* means gentle and weak,\n*infant* means without knowledge.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nThe word *know* implies action without action—\nknowing the *heroic* yet holding to the *receptive* is not seeking victory.\n\n*Constant virtue* is the *constant Way*—\n*not departing* means without interruption.\n*Infant*—without knowledge.\n\n**Master Li** said:\nKnowing the *heroic* yet holding to the *receptive* is not arrogance.\n\n**Master He** said:\nWhen the Heavenly gates open and close,\ncan one truly be *receptive*?\nI would rather remain still and humble—\nweakness overcomes strength.\n\n**Master Ni** said:\nFirst, one must *know* the *heroic*,\nthen speak of holding to the *receptive*—\nit is not that one does not know the *heroic*’s strength,\nbut that one can embrace the *receptive*’s gentleness—\nthis is what is precious.\nIf one only knew the *heroic* and held to the *receptive* without understanding,\neven the world’s foolish and weak could claim to know the Way—\nhow could this be?\n\nThus, one must first know and yet be able to refrain—\nthis is the mark of the *Daoist*.\n\nThe *infant* is a metaphor for the beginning of the Way.\n\n---\nKnow the *bright* yet hold to the *dark*—\nbe the model of the world.\n\nTo be the model of the world,\never abiding in constant virtue without error,\nreturning to the *Unbounded*.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\n*Bright* illustrates the Dao’s manifestation,\n*dark* illustrates its return.\nThe sage knows his heart is pure and unblemished,\nwise yet not acting—\nonly then can he embrace its depths,\nholding wisdom like foolishness,\nconcealing his light like darkness,\napplying it to himself and others,\nbecoming the world’s model.\nOnce established as the standard and measure,\nupright yet not arbitrary,\npublic yet not partial,\nacting with constancy—\nno deviation or fault remains.\nIn the body, *bright* is the metal’s domain,\n*dark* is the water’s reservoir.\nKnowing metal and water generate and complete each other,\nas the foundation of life,\none must refine the elixir,\npreserve the primordial essence,\ncirculate and transform—\nachieving the true body,\nbecoming the world’s model for cultivation.\nMoreover, the constant virtue is self-aware and effortless,\ndirect and comprehensive—\nno flaw, no error,\nspirit in perfect accord—\nhow could it ever be exhausted?\nThus it is said:\n*Bright* illustrates clarity,\n*dark* illustrates silence.\nThough one knows one’s own clarity,\none must also hold to silence.\nLike darkness with nothing to see,\nthus becoming the world’s model—\nvirtue remains constant.\n\n**Master He** said:\nDo not tread upon the *bright*—\nthis ensures eternal preservation.\nI would rather take the *dark* as virtue,\nmaking clarity like obscurity.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\n*Bright* means luminous,\n*dark* means obscure,\n*Unbounded*—without limit.\n\n**Master Li** said:\nThose who know the *bright* yet hold to the *dark*—\nthey do not reveal themselves.\nThose who know their *honor* yet hold to their *humiliation*—\nthey become the world’s *valley*.\n\nAs the world’s *valley*,\nconstant virtue is then complete—\nreturning to the *Uncarved*.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe coming of *honor* and *humiliation* is beyond human foresight,\nyet they arrive and depart as they will.\nAt first, there is no entanglement.\nThe Sage knows the exalted station of their place—\nto bask in *honor* yet guard against *humiliation*,\nto accept filth and conceal stains,\nlike the *valley*’s emptiness.\nWhen the *valley* is empty,\nnothing is excluded—\nno distinction between self and other,\ninner virtue overflowing,\none nature pure and unchanging—\nreturning to the *Uncarved*.\n\n**Master Li** said:\nTo know *honor* yet hold to *humiliation*—\nthis is not to exalt oneself.\nTo guard the *female* and embrace the *dark*—\nthis is not to reveal one’s own clarity.\n\n**Master He** said:\nThe greatest *bright* is like *humiliation*,\nthe most *virtue* is like insufficiency—\nI would rather endure filth and misfortune,\nfor loss brings gain.\nThe terms *infant* (*婴儿*), *Unbounded* (*无极*), and *Uncarved* (*朴*)—\nall speak of the Dao’s return to its origin.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\n*Complete* refers to fullness,\n*Uncarved* is the *Great Uncarved* (*太朴*)—\nthe beginning of heaven and earth.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\n*Honor* means exalted nobility,\n*humiliation* means lowly abasement,\n*Uncarved* means raw wood yet to become a vessel.\nThe meaning of this passage is to preserve constant virtue\nand return to the original, beginningless Dao.\nConstant virtue is the virtue of *effortless emptiness*—\nthus, one prefers the *dark* over the *bright*,\nthe *female* over the *male*,\n*humiliation* over *honor*.\nThose who know and uphold it,\nthough aware of the other’s worth,\nyet choose to guard and remain in the lowly—\nwhen they fully embody this *effortless emptiness*,\nthey may return to the beginningless Dao.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Virtue reaches its peak when it aligns with the original\"*—\nthe terms *Unbounded*, *infant*, and *Uncarved*\nall illustrate the beginningless Dao.\nWhen the *Uncarved* is dispersed, it becomes vessels—\nthe Sage employs it,\nand thus becomes the *official* of heaven and earth.\nHence, the great *measure* does not *sever*.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nThe *Great Uncarved* is dispersed, and only then do vessels arise—\nwhat is beyond form is called *Dao*,\nwhat is beneath form is called *vessel*.\nThe Sage uses the *Dao* beyond form to govern what is beneath form,\nand thus all things between heaven and earth fulfill their roles.\nThe Sage governs the Three Powers to command all things—\nthough their duties overlap,\nthey still obey my will—\nthis is the *official* of all things between heaven and earth.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The Sage manages the roles of heaven and earth\"*—\nthis is merely one aspect of the *Dao*’s governance.\n*Sever* means *to divide*—\nto govern things with the *Dao* is called the *great measure*,\nand when measured, *Dao* and *vessel* do not separate—\nthis is the meaning of *acting without action*,\n*effortless naturalness*.\n\n**Master He** said:\nThe *Uncarved* is the origin of the *Dao*’s effortlessness,\nthe *vessel* is the name for things that are shaped by effort.\nThe Sage cannot prevent the *Uncarved* from becoming vessels,\nyet skillfully employs them\nto manage the roles of heaven and earth,\nto lead the people and command all things—\nthough the *great measure* governs,\nit does not *sever*—\nit nurtures without harming,\nthe power of the *Dao* itself.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\nWhere there is governance, one must use a blade to divide the whole—\nyet the *great measure* governs by not governing,\nthus it does not *sever*.\nThe *great scattering* is not scattering,\nthe *great use* is not using—\nthis is also like the *great measure*’s non-*severance*.\n\n**Chapter XXIX**\nWhen one seeks to take the world yet acts upon it,\nI see their necessity as inevitable.\nThe world is a *divine vessel*—\nit cannot be shaped.\nThose who shape it will ruin it,\nthose who grasp it will lose it.\n\n**Master He** said:\nThe scriptures speak of three warnings against the world—\nto awaken the hearts of traitorous ministers and rebellious officials across ten thousand generations,\nthose who are blind to *authority* and *right*,\nwho transgress order and seize power recklessly,\nwho externally overestimate their strength,\nyet internally fail to grasp *command*—\nthese are those who bring their own destruction,\nand I show them their calamity as a warning.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Take the world by doing nothing\"*—\ndo not harbor even a speck of *action* in your heart.\nThe world is a *great thing*, a *divine vessel*—\nnot something human strength can covet.\nAs King Wen held two-thirds of the world,\nhow could he ever have had the heart to *take* it?\nAs Yao’s *yellow house* was not his own doing,\nand Shun and Yu ruled the world yet did not claim it—\nhow could they ever have had the heart to *grasp* it?\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe Sage’s possession of the world is not *taking*—\ntheir governance of the world is not *doing*.\nWhy so?\nBecause they never had the heart to *take* or *do*.\nThus they could harmonize with the world’s constant *Dao*,\nassist in the natural unfolding of all things—\nall things return to them,\nnot out of necessity, but willingly.\nIf one harbors the heart to *take* and *act* upon the world,\nwill they not rely on cleverness and force,\ncontradicting the *Dao* and losing its natural order?\nThe *divine vessel* is the supreme treasure,\nthe domain of heaven and earth’s *divine brilliance*—\nit commands all existence,\nsubdues all movement—\nindeed, it cannot be shaped.\nIf one pursues their own private gain,\ninterfering in the world’s affairs,\nbound by things and claiming them as their own,\nacting without knowing when to stop—\nthey will enter the realm of *worry* and *calamity*,\nnot only losing the highest truth,\nbut also their own authenticity—\nwhy bother governing the world at all?\nThe human heart encompasses all the world’s marvels—\nwhat is prized is its *naturalness*.\nOnce one acts upon it,\nthey can no longer remain

who *shape* it desire its completion,\nthus they ruin it.\nThose who *grasp* it desire its possession,\nthus they lose it.\nIf one remains *without action*, they will not ruin it—\nif one does not *grasp*, they will not lose it—\nthus they attain the *Dao*!\n\nThe **Li Family** says:\n*\"To act is to have affairs; not to act is to have no affairs. Those who grasp lose; those who act fail—this is the warning against action.\"*\n\nThe **Lin Family** says:\n*\"The divine vessel of the world—\nhow can it be attained by human strength?\nWhen the Dao flourishes and virtue reaches its peak,\nthe world submits to it.\nIf one harbors the intention to seize the world and forcefully do good,\nseeking to gain something,\nthen the unattainable becomes even more so.\nFor all things under heaven,\none must not seek them with intention.\nThose who act will fail;\nthose who grasp will lose—\nthese are the burdens of intention.\nAll things either move forward or follow,\neither warm with breath or chill with wind,\neither prevail with strength or falter with weakness,\neither succeed with elevation or collapse with ruin.\nThus, the Sage avoids excess,\navoids extravagance,\navoids extravagance—\nthis is the **He Family**’s teaching:\n*What is lost to one is gained by another;\nwhat is completed here is deficient there.\nLoss and gain, completion and deficiency—\nthey cycle endlessly, as in the *Liezi*’s parable:\nthe praying mantis seizes the cicada,\nunaware of the sparrow behind.\nThus, when one moves forward, another follows;\nwhen one breathes warmth, another blows cold;\nwhen one prevails with strength, another weakens it;\nwhen one succeeds with elevation, another ruins it—\nthey guard each other like shadows to form,\nlike things guarding things.\nHow much more so the world, greater than all things,\ncan one have intention, action, or grasping?\nExcess is overreaching—\nthe Dao takes weakness as its standard,\nemptiness as its substance,\nand avoids overreaching—\nthus, to remove excess is to eliminate frivolous waste.\nThe Dao takes origin as its refinement,\nthings as its coarseness—\nextravagance leads to insolence,\nthus, to remove extravagance is to eliminate arrogant excess.\nThe Dao takes depth as its root,\nsimplicity as its measure,\nand does not consider the world as extravagant—\nthus, to remove extravagance is to avoid arrogance.\nThese three are all the extravagant hearts of action;\nremoving these three,\nthe Sage’s heart is empty—\nthe world cannot disturb it.\"*\n\nThe **Li Family** says:\n*\"Strength and weakness, elevation and ruin—\nthey mutually rely and overturn each other,\nlike shadows following form.\nWhere there is success, there is also failure—\nthus, the Sage avoids greed for excess,\navoids extravagance,\navoids arrogance and extravagance,\nand deeply warns future generations.\"*\n\nThe **Su Family** says:\n*\"Some move forward, some follow behind;\nsome breathe warmth, some blow cold;\nsome strengthen and benefit, some weaken and diminish;\nsome succeed with elevation, some ruin with collapse—\nthese are the natural ways of things,\ninevitable forces that cannot be avoided.\"*\n\nThe **Wu Family** says:\n*\"This follows the earlier warning: *‘Those who grasp lose.’*\nThe Way of governing the world—\nthose who hold the world,\nhow can they long preserve it as their own without losing it?\nThe cycles of gain and loss, survival and ruin,\nare like moving forward and following,\nbreathing warmth and blowing cold,\nstrength and weakness,\nelevation and ruin—\nthese eight opposites interdependently arise.\nThe Sage knows these forces must reach this point,\nand thus has a Way to respond.\nAll that is overabundant must decline—\nonly by preventing overabundance\ncan one avoid decline.\nIf one does not exceed in greed, extravagance, or arrogance,\nthen at the peak of abundance,\none can preserve the world.\n*The Collected Commentaries on the Dao De Jing*, Volume Four concludes.\nVolume Five begins.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Those Who Assist the Sovereign with the Dao Do Not Use Military Might to Subdue the World**\n\nTheir affairs tend to return.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nThose of the Dao who assist their sovereign must first establish virtue as their foundation. Armies and weapons are but the final means. The sovereign governs ministers with propriety, and ministers serve the sovereign with loyalty. If the ruler acts without artifice, the people transform themselves spontaneously. The common folk flourish in harmony, unaware of imperial might, yet they engage in warfare—how can this be the Dao?\n\nWar is an omen of calamity, and battle is a perilous affair. It is not the instrument of the virtuous. Used only when unavoidable, victory brings defeat, and gain brings harm. How can one justly subdue the weak or violently oppress the good? When beasts are cornered, they strike back; when things reach their extreme, they reverse. This is inevitable.\n\n**Master Ni** says:\nIt does not say *\"the sovereign\"* but *\"those who assist the sovereign with the Dao,\"* meaning that even if the sovereign harbors intentions of war, if the great ministers do not comply, he may not necessarily act upon them.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nTo assist the sovereign while prioritizing military strength is not to know the Dao. War is a cruel instrument—if I harm others, others will harm me in return. Thus, it is said that such affairs tend to return.\n\n**Master Wang** says:\nThose who assist the sovereign with the Dao still refrain from using military might to subdue the world—how much more so should the sovereign himself, who embodies the Dao?\n\nWhere the teacher treads, brambles grow.\nAfter great armies pass, there will surely be years of famine.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nWhere armies have marched, both ancient and modern battlefields, few reap lasting benefit. Fields lie fallow, homes stand empty, and brambles thrive—how can one not fear this?\n\nWhen great armies march, they disrupt the natural order above and drain the people’s strength below. Harmonious *qi* fails to ascend, and killing *qi* floods below. Both people and things suffer violence. The six *qi* become unbalanced, and rain and sun lose their proper timing. Plagues and disasters follow, and famine ensues after war—this is the natural course.\n\n**Master Su** says:\nWhere war is waged, civil affairs falter, and fields lie untended. After battle, killing *qi* surges, and crops wither.\n\n**Political Harmony Annotation**:\nThe people’s strength is drained below, hence brambles grow. The natural order is disrupted above, hence years of famine follow.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nIn lands where armies are deployed, farmers cannot till the soil, and brambles arise. After war, the harmony of Heaven and Earth is wounded, and years of famine inevitably follow. Thus, the virtuous act decisively but do not seek strength. Act decisively without arrogance, without boasting, without pride—act only when unavoidable, and do not seek strength.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nThough military strength and victory in battle are methods to suppress violence and quell disorder, they must not be discarded—like water and fire, their proper use brings blessing, but misuse brings ruin. Those who skillfully wield arms act decisively but do not seek strength. What virtue cannot transform and what governance cannot reach must be addressed only when unavoidable, pressed only when necessary. When they act, they do so without fail, not relying on strength to take what is not theirs. This is the clear path of virtuous victory.\n\nAct decisively without boasting of your ability—for boasting leads to decline.\nAct decisively without praising your virtue—for praise undermines true merit.\nAct decisively without growing proud of your power—for pride leads to insufficiency.\n\nMatters of aggression may be addressed, but not to seek strength.\n\n**Master He** says:\nVirtue lies not in waging war but in wielding it well. By *\"decisive\"* (*guǒ*), he means clarity of vision and firm resolve. Decisiveness is secondary to doing good, not to wielding arms for conquest. As the *Classic* says: *\"The contest is of heart and strength.\"* Thus, one acts decisively but does not seek strength. Again, it says: *\"Act decisively but do not seek strength.\"*\n\nTo not boast of ability, not to praise one’s deeds, not to grow arrogant—these are the expressions of a virtuous heart. Thus, one acts with decisive resolve, not competing in heart. Only in the matter of extreme military strength does one act decisively to reject it, not competing in force.\n\n**Master Dong** says:\nThough the Dao rejects war, Heaven endows the five elements, which cannot be discarded—like water and fire, their proper use is essential. Only when used to suppress violence and aid the distressed does decisiveness follow principle. Whatever principles and righteousness belong to us, we uphold them without bending.\n\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: *\"Decisive action means killing enemies to prevent mutual aggression—how dare one seek strength over the world?\"*\n\nDecisive action wins through principle; strength wins through force. Decisiveness carries an inherent certainty of victory, yet it does not rely on force or delight in war. Thus, when facing matters, one fears, plans carefully, and acts only when unavoidable—simply avoiding strength.\n\nWhen things reach their peak, they decline—this is called *not the Dao*. *Not the Dao* must be abandoned early.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nThe strong cannot remain strong, the arrogant cannot remain arrogant. Just as all things, once at their peak, must decline—those who do not understand this principle yet seek to dominate the world are acting against the Dao. Knowing this, they must swiftly abandon it. *\"Early abandonment\"* means to cease and not persist.\n\n**Master Su** says:\nThings grow strong, then decline—none escape this. Only those of the Dao, though complete, appear deficient; though full, appear empty. They never grow strong, never decline, never die. To use military might to subdue the world is extreme strength—how can it avoid decline?\n\n**Master He** says:\nWhy does the Sage retreat in humility, unwilling to seek victory over the world? Because He sees that when the sun reaches its zenith, it declines; when the moon is full, it wanes; when things reach their peak, decline follows. Is this not the natural course of the Dao? If one knows this is not the Dao, then one must swiftly return to it, swiftly abandon what is not the Dao. The causes of ruined states are many, but those who delight in arms are doomed to fall.\n\nWith the Dao to govern the people and the state, how could one not take the use of arms as a warning and skillfully employ their consequences?\n\n**Master Dong** says:\nWhen things reach their peak of strength, they grow old; when arms are at their strongest, they meet defeat. Thus, those who rely on military might cannot fully preserve their virtue in victory. To employ strength is precisely what hastens decay and decline—all of which are contrary to the Dao. One should know when to stop early.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\nFine arms are instruments of ill omen. People detest them, and thus those who follow the Dao do not wield them.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nFine arms mean delighting in warfare, taking pleasure in using arms—this is the nature of an ill-omened person. An ill-omened person engaging in ill-omened deeds makes arms an ill-omened instrument, which the world detests. Hence, those who follow the Dao do not use them.\n\n**Master Li** says:\nNot using arms to subdue the world, those who rank arms as ill-omened instruments—this is the Sage’s profound warning to all future rulers of states. With non-action, purity, and tranquil governance, the realm naturally attains peace. Though arms exist, they are not displayed, and the scourge of contention is forever averted.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nArms are not tools for achieving great peace and governance. Though they may be used to punish tyranny, if one is forced to employ them, how can one avoid dark machinations? Those who adorn themselves with weapons as ornaments are already indulging in their cruelest use. This is to glorify a deadly instrument and hope for the world’s blessing—it is not only hated by people but also feared by all things.\n\nThe *Continuation of the Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government* records that Song Emperor Taizong said to his close ministers:\n*\"When I read in Laozi that ‘Fine arms are instruments of ill omen,’ and that the Sage uses them only when unavoidable, I have never failed to reflect on this as a solemn warning three times over.*\n\n*The virtuous in repose honor the left; in war, they honor the right.*\n\n*Arms are instruments of ill omen, not the tools of the virtuous. Used only when unavoidable, tranquility is supreme.*\n\n*To win yet not take pride in it, yet to take pride is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world.*\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nThe virtuous always honor the left in repose, yet in war, they honor the right—this shows that even the ancients regarded arms as ill-omened deeds, not something the virtuous would willingly use. They are employed only when unavoidable. Even if forced to wage war, they hold tranquility in highest regard. Tranquility is without relish, signifying the unwillingness born of necessity. Though victorious, they do not rejoice. ‘Not taking pride’ means war is no good deed. If one takes pride in war, then killing becomes a delight—how could such a person ever fulfill their ambitions in the world? As *Mencius* says: ‘Those who do not delight in killing can unite the world.’ This is the same meaning.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth places yang on the left and yin on the right. Yang embodies virtue, life, and gentleness—thus, in repose, it is honored. Yin embodies punishment, killing, and strength—thus, in war, it is exalted.\n\n**Master Wu** says:\nTranquility means without exultation; simplicity means without excess. To hold war in disdain is to govern supremely. Though victorious, they do not glory in it—war is no noble deed. If one glories in victory, then killing is their delight. Those who delight in killing cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world. This is the final admonition.\n\n*Auspicious rites honor the left; inauspicious rites honor the right. The Assistant General stands to the left, the Commanding General to the right—this is to treat war as a funeral.*\n\n*When many die, one mourns with tears. Victory in war is treated as a funeral.*\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nThe Assistant General’s rank is subordinate to the Commanding General, yet here the Commanding General stands to the right while the Assistant General stands to the left—this shows the ancients treated war as an inauspicious affair, thus observing funeral rites. Left is yang, right is yin; funeral rites exalt yin. Even if victorious, one should treat it as mourning, weeping for the dead with sorrow. The intent of this chapter is that those who seek victory in life are doomed to misfortune, not blessed.\n\n**Master He** says:\nTo treat victory as though it were defeat, observing funeral rites—this is the height of compassion. When the Qin army was defeated at Heng and retreated, the Duke of Qin wore mourning attire at the outskirts and wept toward the troops. This was fitting for defeat, but there has never been one who, upon victory, mourned in this way. Only those who deeply embody Heaven and Earth’s love for life and universal compassion could be moved to such grief.\n\nCompassion makes one courageous; sorrow makes one victorious. The Dao resides here. But if one takes arms as fine, killing as delight, and victory as beautiful, then one does not know the Dao, one does not know Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two**\nThe Dao is ever nameless. Though crude and seemingly small, the world dares not submit to it. If lords and kings can preserve it, all things will come of their own accord.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nThe Dao is difficult to speak of—it encompasses all things, penetrating the finest and the vast. How could it be named or compared to simplicity? Crude refers to its pure, unadulterated essence, one without mixture, boundless and all-pervading. Though called \"small,\" it is not small in size, but in its formlessness, its non-action, its subtle and wondrous nature—beyond grasp or imitation. Thus, it is named \"small.\"\n\nAll worldly tools and instruments, once named, are subject to the nameless. Only the Dao’s crudeness underpins all things—Heaven and Earth cannot violate it, sages and wise cannot interfere, and yet how could the world submit to it? If lords and kings preserve this crudeness, the world will naturally be governed.\n\nTo liken it to oneself: lords and kings are originally like unspoiled children. The unmanifest Heavenly Sovereign is called the Original Spirit. If one guards it without loss, one becomes one with the Spirit.\n\nThe Dao’s supreme constancy is unassailable—all ten thousand *qi* bow to it. Hence it is said: **\"The Dao is ever nameless.\"**\n\nThough *pu* (crudeness) is small, the world does not dare to subject itself to it.\nIf lords and kings can preserve this *pu*, all things will naturally submit.\n\n**○ Master He says:** The phrase *\"Dao is ever\"* is a complete sentence, like *\"Heaven is ever true\"* or *\"constancy is ever true\"*—it means the eternal Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is formless and nameless; yet, when forced to name it, we call it \"Dao.\"\nIts namelessness is the Dao’s eternal essence—*pu* itself.\nAll things that can be named or spoken of are not true constancy, but mere instruments.\nThus, it is said: **\"Heaven and Earth, along with all sentient beings, are originally rooted in the Dao, all emerging from the primordial *Tai Su* (Great Substance), the initial stage of emptiness and nothingness.\"**\n\n*Pu* is the Great Substance, the origin of the nameless.\nBefore differentiation into the myriad forms of existence, it alone remains within the Great Chaos.\n*Pu* is subtle beyond measure—hard to know, hard to see—thus it is called \"small.\"\n\nThe Sage discerns the root of constancy and *pu*, embraces the Substance while preserving *pu*.\nThis is simplicity in essence and ease in practice, few actions yet great achievements,\na heart of non-action, safeguarding the utmost rectitude.\nThe Dao is both empty and real, void yet present—\nwith it, one governs the heavy and light,\nand may rule the world,\nyet how could the world dare to subject itself to such governance?\n\nWith it, one dwells in stillness yet commands motion,\nand may become the master of all things—\nyet all things will naturally submit to such mastery.\n\n**○ Master Li says:** *\"The Dao is ever nameless\"*—this is the natural state of emptiness and nothingness.\n*Pu* is small, yet supremely subtle—\nthe world does not dare to subject itself to it, for it is the utmost reverence.\nAll things will naturally submit—none will resist.\n**○ Master Lin says:** *\"The Dao is ever nameless\"*—\nthough it may be named as \"extraordinary\" or \"nameless,\" the nameless *pu* is the Dao itself.\nThough it seems the smallest, the world cannot but honor it—\nwho would dare to belittle it?\nThus, it is said: *\"the world does not dare to subject itself to it.\"*\n\nFor those who become lords and kings,\nif they can preserve this Dao,\nthen all things will naturally submit and serve them.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite in harmony,\nand sweet dew descends.\nNo one commands it,\nyet all is balanced naturally.\n\n**○ Master Lü says:** When Heaven and Earth interact, all things are born.\nWhen human Dao interacts, achievements are fulfilled.\nWhat then if the Sage acts,\nand all things respond?\nThe harmonious *qi* silently aligns—\nabove, it reaches the Celestial Clarity (*Tai Qing*),\nbelow, it coils around the Great Tranquility (*Tai Ning*).\nIt transforms into sweet dew,\nnourishing all things.\nInitially, none know who commands it,\nyet it descends and ascends in perfect balance,\nentering and exiting through the Mysterious Mother (*Xuan Mu*),\nconverging at the Yellow Court (*Huang Ting*).\nPiercing this meaning,\none establishes the reversal of the infant.\n**○ Master He says:** When the Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth in virtue,\ntimely rains descend and sweet springs flow—\nthe sweet dew may be attained.\nWhen the Sage unites in heart with all beings,\nteaching and transformation flourish,\ncustoms shift—\nthe world does not await commands but naturally finds harmony.\nSweet dew is the auspicious response of kings—\nrefined as fat, sweet as honey,\nreceived by pine and bamboo alike.\nBecause the Sage preserves *pu* in stillness and quietude,\nthe natural responses are thus.\n\n**○ Master Li says:** When Heaven and Earth unite,\nit is virtue alone that supports them,\nand sweet dew descends from harmonious *qi*.\nTheir natural balance is the peace of harmony itself.\n\nFrom the beginning, there was *pu* and the nameless.\nOnce names arise, one must know when to stop—\nknowing when to stop ensures no peril.\n**○ Master Lü says:** With seasons passing and years turning,\nthings manifest through their functions.\n*Pu* differentiates into instruments,\nnames arise from these instruments.\nOnce distinctions are set,\nrank and hierarchy appear—\none cannot transgress above or below.\nIf one does not know when to stop,\npursuing names while forgetting *pu*,\nabandoning the root for the branches,\nthen one loses their foundation.\n\nThe wise who know when to stop\nare both enlightened and sagely,\nself-sufficient within,\nrequiring nothing from without—\nhow could they face danger or peril?\n\n**○ Master Lin says:** The Dao’s origin is nameless.\nOnce the myriad things arise,\nthen the Dao’s name appears.\nCreation itself is the scattering of *pu* into instruments.\nThis name having arisen,\none generates two, two generate three—\nwhere does it end?\n\nThose who know the Dao\nmust recognize this point and stop—\nknowing when to stop ensures no peril.\n\n**○ Master He says:** From the nameless to the named,\nfrom the beginning to the mother—\nwithin every scattering of *pu* into instruments,\nthere lies a supreme principle that cannot be severed.\nTracing the flow to its source,\nexploring the root to its branches,\nreturning to the beginning while harmonizing,\nerasing distinctions into formlessness,\npreventing the loss of the Dao—\nthose who stray and forget return,\nyet stopping is perilous, stopping is humiliation.\nThus, it is said: *\"Once named, return to the Dao.\"*\n\nLong-lasting achievements and virtue\nbring lifelong freedom from blame—\nthus, *\"it cannot be named.\"*\n\nThe Dao’s initial stage may be named,\nbut those who know the Dao’s remainder\nalso grasp the Dao of the Primordial Beginning (*Yuan Shi*),\nand those who know its remainder\nalign with the pivot of yin and yang—\nmixing into one,\nthey may harmonize with Heaven and Earth.\n\n**○ Master Wu says:** The \"beginning\" is the Dao,\n\"making\" is creation—\njust as one says \"to do.\"\nThe \"named\" is virtue.\nThe Dao is nameless,\nyet when it manifests as virtue,\nthen it is named.\nThe Dao’s nameless virtue becomes virtue—\nonce named, one must know when to stop at virtue,\nand not descend further.\nThe intent of this passage is:\nwhen one moves from nothingness to existence,\none must know to stop at virtue—\nit cannot be furthered beyond this.\n\nBelow the named virtue,\none returns to the Dao and descends to virtue—\nis this possible?\nKnowing when to stop at virtue,\none is still not far from the Dao.\n\nTo liken the Dao in the world\nto rivers and valleys compared to the sea.\n\n**○ Master Lü says:** The Dao is the origin of all things,\nrivers and valleys are the divisions of water,\nthe sea is the gathering of water.\nYet the Dao in the world—\nabove, it ascends to the Celestial Clarity (*Qing Du*) and Purple Micro (*Zi Wei*),\nbelow, it mingles with the humble and the coarse.\nFollowing it brings prosperity,\ncontradicting it brings ruin—\nlike the sea, it is compared to this.\nIf one does good,\nit permeates and nourishes all things,\nif one does evil,\nit surges and brings calamity.\nYet the Dao grows ever higher the more it descends,\nthe sea grows ever fuller the more it is tilted.\nThe Sage’s virtue encompasses Heaven and Earth,\nnourishment extends near and far—\nthen the people cannot but return to such virtue.\n\n**○ Master Wu says:** The preceding text speaks of arising from Nonbeing to Being;\nthis now speaks of returning from Being to Nonbeing—\nboth must be understood in terms of the Dao.\nFor the Dao in the world is like the sea and rivers,\nwhile virtue is like the tributaries converging into them.\n\n**○ Master He says:** The Dao in the world\nis like the sea receiving all rivers—\nthe sea does not desire the waters,\nyet the waters naturally flow to it.\nIf one returns to simplicity and non-action,\nthe Dao is not sought,\nyet it naturally comes—\neffortless, not forced.\nThe Sage begins with silent stillness and non-action,\nthen transcends all entanglements of name and form.\nHis Dao endures through ten thousand ages without change—\ntruly, it is the Eternal Constant.\n\n**○ Master Lin says:** The waters of rivers and valleys\nmust flow into the sea before they rest,\nand all things under Heaven\nmust return to the Dao before they cease.\nThus it is said:\n*The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the sea.*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three**\n*To know others is wisdom,*\n*to know oneself is enlightenment.*\n\n「Conquering others is strength,\nbut conquering oneself is power.\nMaster Lü says: Knowing others means seeking perfection in things,\ncontrolling life through external means—\nthis is not as good as knowing oneself without knowing,\nenlightening oneself without enlightenment,\nwhich may truly be called **self-knowing** and **self-enlightenment**.\nThose who strive externally conquer others with force,\nbut those who strive internally conquer themselves with the Dao.\nTo establish a state and proclaim a name,\nto grasp authority and wield influence,\nto command all under Heaven,\nto subjugate the feudal lords—\nis this not the use of force to conquer others?\nThe self-conqueror upholds **virtue/power** and **Dao**,\npractices **ren** (benevolence) and **yi** (righteousness),\novercomes self to restore propriety,\nhumble and self-effacing—\nyet people flock to him.\nThus, none under Heaven can conquer him;\nwhat else could this be but **power**?\n\nMaster He says: By human nature,\none is clear in knowing others,\nbut dim in knowing oneself;\nstrong in conquering others,\nbut timid in conquering oneself.\nSo knowing others is merely discerning right and wrong,\nadvantage and harm—\nyet a single moment of knowing wrong,\nand the **spiritual radiance** (*lingguang*) ever shines forth,\nthis is the greatest **self-enlightenment**.\nConquering others is merely a matter of strength and weakness,\ncourage and cowardice—\nyet a single moment of overcoming evil,\nand this is the greatest courage under Heaven,\nthe greatest **self-power**.\nHow far removed this is from those who strive externally but neglect internally!\n\nMaster Wu says: Intelligence can know others,\nbut this is merely external knowledge.\nTo know oneself is to exhaust one’s nature internally,\nthus called **enlightenment**.\nTo have strength and conquer others is to rely on external force,\nbut to conquer oneself is to internally overcome self,\nthus called **power**.\nThe contented man is rich,\nthe resolute man acts with purpose.\nThe steadfast man endures long.\nThe man who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\n\nMaster Lü says: The accomplished man’s work\nendures after his death,\nbenefiting all people—\nhe does not lose his place,\nnor forgets his roots,\nhis influence lasts far into the future,\nso that later generations cannot emulate him.\nIn his body, he guards the **True One** (*Zhenyi*), embraces unity,\nand is not swayed by external things,\nnever for an instant departing from it—\nthen he enters the realm of the **Eternal Constant** (*Zhenchang*),\nenduring through all ages without change,\nunified with the Dao,\nthus it is said: *The steadfast man endures long.*\nThe Sage’s Dao is transmitted through ten thousand ages,\nrecorded in books and decrees,\nlater generations revere him as their teacher,\nthough his person may have passed,\nhis governance remains as if alive.\nThe man of the Dao regards life as a temporary dwelling,\nand death as his final return—\nin his life, he discerns the **tendencies** (*qù*) with clarity,\nunified with the Dao in truth;\nin his death, he sheds the mortal form and attains **spiritual transformation** (*shenhua*),\nlike a cicada casting its shell.\nThough his body dies,\nhis true self does not perish—\nhis longevity matches the **Two Principles** (*Eryi*) in its boundless extent,\nthus it is said: *The man who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.*\n\nMaster He says: **Self-enlightenment** through self-knowing is possible,\nbut one must also attain the **knowing of contentment** (*Zhizú*),\nthen wealth is not bound by the world—\nhis contentment is **Dao-contentment**, **spiritual-contentment**,\nthis is called **true knowing**.\nTo achieve **self-power** and conquer is possible,\nbut one must also attain **resolute action** (*Qiángxíng*),\nthen his purpose can overcome all things—\nhis actions are **diligent action**, **solitary action**,\nthis is called **true power**.\nThus, the two lines—**knowing of contentment** and **resolute action**—\nare connected to the preceding lines on **knowing** and **power**,\nand their meaning becomes clear.\n**Longevity** lies in not losing one’s place—\nthe place is the destination of return,\nas the *Yijing* says: *\"The **stopping** (*Gèn*) Principle stops at its place,\nand finds rest in its place\"*—\nit means that the power to stop is one who stops at its proper place.\nAll things and affairs have their proper place,\nto find it is to be at ease,\nthus **longevity**.\nTo lose it is to go astray;\nhow could it endure?\n**Longevity** lies in death, not in perishing—\ndeath is the meaning of finality,\nas the *Liezi* says: *\"The Dao is the source of eternal life,\nfrom life comes life—\nthough it ends, it does not perish eternally.\"*\nAs the *Zhuangzi* says: *\"A thousand years of life may weary one of the world,\nand they depart to ascend as immortals,\nriding the white clouds,\nreaching the realm of the Emperor.\"*\nThis is also the case.\nAs the saying goes: *\"Establish virtue, achieve great deeds, and attain the Three Unperishables\"* (*Sān Bùxiǔ*),\nthis too is the **not-perishing**.\n\nMaster Li says: The **contented man** finds joy even in poverty,\nthe **resolute man** never falters in beginning or end,\nthe **steadfast man** faces no peril,\nthe **internally enlightened** transcends birth and death—\nthe man who dies yet does not perish,\nhis **True One** eternally abides.\n\nMaster Wu says: The Laozi’s Dao\nuses **obscurity** (*mèi*) as **enlightenment** (*míng*),\nand **weakness** (*ruò*) as **power** (*qiáng*),\nyet this chapter speaks of **enlightenment** and **power**—why?\nBecause Laozi is not obscure internally,\nthough externally he seems so;\nnot weak internally,\nthough externally he appears so.\nHis **obscurity** and **weakness** are remedies for external affairs,\nhis **enlightenment** and **power** are prescriptions for internal cultivation—\nboth are practiced without contradiction.\n\nMaster Dong says: The **place** is as the **stopping** Principle’s place in the *Yijing*—\nonly he who understands the Dao and can act upon it\nfinds his own place and dwells securely,\nthus though external things change without end,\nhis heart never strays—\nthis is the way of **no entry without self-possession** (*Wùrù ér bùzìdé*),\nthe means to **longevity**.\nOnly he who can truly **know himself** and **strengthen himself**\nwithout losing his place\nattains true **longevity**—\nthis is the **unmoved** and **solitary** that does not perish with the changes of life and death,\nstanding alone and enduring eternally—\nhow could it be measured by mere quantity?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\nThe Great Dao flows unrestrained,\nits movement knows no left or right.\nMaster Lü says: It is the most exalted, most profound—\nits boundaries are unfathomable,\nits roots are untraceable.\nOnly the Dao could be so.\nIt encompasses the universe without distinction,\nfills the boundless void,\nits motion and stillness are unceasing,\nits coming and going endless,\nflowing freely without obstruction,\nwandering through all things,\nmoving left and right without restriction—\nits application is vast indeed.\nWithin the body, the Great Dao is the **original qi** (*yuánqì*),\npervading all hundred bones,\nin the joints when full,\nin the passages when full—\nflowing freely without exclusion,\npresent in every part.\n\nMaster Chai says: The Dao is the mystery of all things,\nits presence is never absent.\nThe text often employs the *\"fú\"* (*兮*) particle paired with *\"qí\"* (*其*),\nas in *\"Huāng fú qí wèicháng\"* (\"Vast and boundless, its limits are without end\")\nand *\"Pèi fú qí wèizhào\"* (\"Frail and subtle, its signs are not yet revealed\").\nAgain, in Chapter Fifteen, all lines use *\"fú\"* paired with *\"qí\"*—\nthis is the style of Laozi’s text.\n\n「○ Master Lin says: Vast and boundless, its presence can be left or right,\nwithout any attachment or obstruction.\n\n○ Master He says: Great indeed is the Sage’s Dao,\nnurturing all things, reaching its apex in Heaven.\nWhen speaking of *\"fú\"* (泛), it is profound as the sea,\nlofty yet ever returning to its beginning.\n\nLeft is left, fitting to the left.\nRight is right, fitting to the right.\nThe text says: *\"Hold the Great Symbol\"* (*zhí dàxiàng*),\nand all under Heaven will follow—\nfor there is nothing it cannot traverse.\n\nAll things depend on it for birth yet it does not decline,\nits work accomplished yet it claims no ownership.\n\nMaster Lü says: The power of generation and transformation\noriginates from Nature alone—\nyet the Dao never applies its artifices,\nnor boasts of its abilities.\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast beyond measure,\nthey still rely on it,\nand to all who seek, it gives.\nThough the Six Extremes are vast,\nthey do not depart from its embrace,\nand though the autumn hair is minute,\nit awaits its shaping.\nDoes it not labor endlessly?\nStanding alone, it gives life without resistance,\nfulfills without possession,\ndoes not dwell on its deeds—\nthis is the very essence of the Dao.\n\n○ Master He says: All things lean upon it for gestation,\nrevealing themselves in every place,\nwhile the Sage abides in ease.\n\n○ Master Lin says: All things are born from the Dao,\nhow could it refuse them?\nOnce born, how could it claim them as its own?\nClothing and covering all things yet not ruling them,\never without desire,\nthis may be called *\"small\"*—\nall things return to it yet it does not rule them,\nthis may be called *\"great\"*.\n\nMaster Lü says: The Dao returns in the most hidden depths,\nmanifests in the most transformative ways.\nIt nurtures and shelters,\nas if without beginning or end.\nIt covers and fosters,\neach following its own nature—\nlike a babe by day relying on its milk,\nby night on its swaddling.\nExpanding its virtue of love and nurturing,\nit acts yet does not rely,\nit grows yet does not govern,\nletting all unfold naturally and ever without desire.\n\nWithin, it observes its mystery,\nand nothing escapes its embrace.\nAll movement cannot fathom its path of return—\nthis may be called *\"small\"*, hence it says,\n*\"all things return yet it does not rule\"*.\n\nEver without desire,\nthis may be called *\"small\"*—\nthe Dao is nameless and hidden,\nand its namelessness is vast beyond measure,\nprofound beyond reckoning.\nBefore anything existed,\nit was without form—\nthen all things returned to it,\nand there was no distinction.\nIt harmonized without ruling,\nthus its greatness may be named.\n\n○ Master He says: *\"Clothing and covering\"* means to shelter and reveal.\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*:\nThe Sage encounters it without resistance,\npasses through without clinging,\nadapts and responds—this is *virtue*,\nmatches and aligns—this is the *Dao*—\nand the meaning of *\"not refusing, not possessing, not ruling\"* is clear.\n\nEver without desire is stillness—\nthe Sage unifies in *non-action* and *non-desire*,\nso its heart is without heart.\nGathered, it does not fill a palm’s grasp,\nthough simplicity may seem small,\nall things return to it.\nNot ruling means each thing is entrusted to its own way,\nscattered yet filling the Six Extremes—\nhow vast it is!\nThus it is said:\nHeaven and Earth have their constancy,\nthe sun and moon their brightness,\nbirds and beasts their groupings,\ntrees and woods their standing.\n\nThe Sage lets virtue flow and follows the Dao,\nalready attaining perfection.\nFrom this perspective,\nthe Divine Person has no deeds,\nthe Sage no name—\nwhy would it dwell on dominion?\nThus it says:\n*\"Its deeds cover all under Heaven yet seem not its own,\ntransforming and granting yet the people do not rely on it—\nthough it has no name to be raised,\nit lets things rejoice in their own accord,\nstanding in the unfathomable,\nwandering in the nonexistent.\"*\n\nMaster Li says: *\"Clothing and covering all things yet not ruling\"* means\nforgetting its own origin.\n*\"All things return yet it does not rule\"* means\nletting all unfold naturally.\n\nThus the Sage never claims to be great,\nand so it achieves greatness.\n\nMaster Lin says: Only by being small can one be great—\nthe Sage’s refusal to claim greatness\nis how its deeds are fulfilled.\n\nThis is the meaning of *\"retaining the feminine,\nthe Dao becomes the valley of all under Heaven.\"*\n\n○ Master He says: The Sage never claims to be great,\nyet greatness is achieved through this.\nThough at first it may seem unclear and unpossessed,\nits greatness cannot be concealed in the end—\nis this not the Dao?\n\n○ Master Wu says: This chapter begins with the Dao of Heaven and Earth,\nthen concludes with the Sage—\nfor the Sage and Heaven and Earth are one.\n\nWhen the yearly work is complete and all things return,\nthis is the Dao’s ultimate greatness—\nyet Heaven and Earth do not dwell on their deeds,\nand all things know no ruler.\nThus, though the Dao of Heaven and Earth is great,\nit does not claim greatness itself,\nand the Sage is likewise—\nhence it achieves greatness.\n\nMaster Lü says: Within the realm, there are four great things,\nyet the Emperor resides in one of them.\nThe Sage holds humility as its instrument,\ndwells in self-effacement,\nis lowly so that others exalt it,\nis humble so that others honor it.\nIt forgets its towering might,\ndiscards its boastful demeanor—\nthen it can fulfill the Dao’s complete greatness.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five**\n*Hold the Great Symbol*, and all under Heaven will follow.\nGo forth without harm,\nand peace and tranquility endure.\n\n○ Master He says: The Great Dao has no form,\nso it lacks even the symbol of form—\nyet its symbol is vast.\nThe Dao encompasses Heaven and Earth,\nenters the minutest hairs—\nit cannot be named or described,\nthus it is called the *Great Symbol*.\nTo say *\"hold\"* means to uphold this and go forth—\nif one can embody the nameless, formless Dao,\nand follow Nature’s constant transformations,\nthen governing the body and the realm,\nspanning past and future—\nwhat path cannot it traverse?\n\nThough I say *\"all under Heaven is my path\"*,\nit is not merely that it does not harm—\nit also calms the nature of life and death,\nsecures the blessings of moderation,\nand stands serene without further action,\nreaching the pinnacle of its journey—\nthe moment of perfect harmony between Heaven and humanity.\n\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*:\n*\"If one attains its Dao,\nthere is nothing it cannot do.\"*\n\nThe **Lin** says: *\"The Great Symbol*—\nthis is the symbol of the formless.\nTo traverse all under Heaven*—\nit is to hold the Dao and act accordingly.\nWhen one governs all under Heaven with the Dao,\nwho can harm it? If all under Heaven is unharmed,\nthen it is tranquil, serene, and boundless.*\n\nThe **Zhenghe** annotation reads:\n*\"Tranquility means no peril,\nserenity means no obstruction,\nboundlessness means universal harmony.\"*\n\nMusic and feasts—\npassing guests pause.\nThe Dao when spoken of,\nis bland and without flavor;\nwhen seen, it is not visible;\nwhen heard, it is not audible;\nwhen used, it cannot be exhausted.\n\nThe **He** says: *\"Five tones and six pitches suffice the ears,\neight delicacies and nine tripods suffice the mouth—\nthese are but the most appealing sounds and tastes to mortals,\nonly enough to amuse passing guests for a fleeting moment,\nnot the true source of nourishing the spirit or prolonging life.\"*\n\nWhen the feast ends and guests depart,\nwhat concern are they to me?\nAll things that satisfy desire enough to unsettle the heart\nare of this kind.\n\nYet the Great Dao is not so.\nWith stillness, one refines the self—\nmusic and color have their limits in delight.\nWith frugality, one sustains life—\nrichness and taste have their limits in indulgence.\nOne wanders the heart toward the bland,\nand unites the *qi* with the boundless.\nNurturing the formless, the form abides;\nguarding the bodiless, the body remains whole.\nFlavor without flavor is sweet,\nvision without sight is clear,\nhearing without sound is acute,\nuse without end is vast.\n\nIt cannot be exhausted—\nfor exhaustion means completion.\nNot that its use is without end,\nbut that its Dao is inherently boundless.\n\nThe **Li** says:\n*\"Music and feasts—\nsounds and tastes both exquisite—\nif one abandons the formless,\nhow long can they endure?\"*\n\nThe Dao when spoken of,\nhas no flavor, no form,\nno sound, no color—\nbecause it is bodiless,\nits application is boundless.\n\nThe **Lin** says:\n*\"Music*—\nthe joy of bells and drums—\n*feasts*—\nthe abundance of food and drink—\nset music and prepare banquets\nto welcome honored guests.\nWhen the music ends and the feast is consumed,\nthe guests depart and it ceases.\nDeparture*—\nthis is leaving.\nThough the Dao’s flavor may seem most subtle,\nthough it is unseen when viewed,\nthough it is inaudible when heard—\nthis is to say it does not please the ears and eyes—\nyet its use spans past and present without end.\nThis is the meaning: things have limits,\nbut the Dao is boundless.\"*\n\nWhen one speaks of the Dao emerging from words,\nit is as if to say:\n*\"The Dao in its expression.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six:**\n*\"When one would contract it,\nmust first fully expand it.\nWhen one would weaken it,\nmust first fully strengthen it.\nWhen one would discard it,\nmust first fully promote it.\nWhen one would take from it,\nmust first fully give to it.\nThis is called *subtle clarity*.\"*\n\nThe **Li** says:\n*\"To hold the Great Symbol,\none can perceive the subtlest workings of things—\nonce expansion is seen,\none knows contraction is coming.\nBefore the first sign appears,\none already knows.\nThis is not the *subtle clarity* of all under Heaven—\nwho else can attain this?\"*\n\nThe **Lin** says:\n*\"These eight lines are all metaphors,\nexpressing only the principle:\nwhere there is gain, there must be loss.\nContract*—\nto gather and to slacken—\nwhat is expanded must slacken;\nwhat is strong must weaken;\nwhat is promoted must decline.\nGain must have its loss.\nTo give*—\nto receive;\nto take*—\nto lose.\nOnly those who do not understand\ntake this as joy,\nunaware of the principle—\nthough it seems obscure,\nit is truly clear.\nHence, it is called *subtle clarity*.\nSubtle*—\nas obscure as the dim—\nyet its meaning is most evident.\"*\n\nThe **He** says:\n*\"Heaven cannot be trusted,\nprinciples have no fixed state—\nwho can unify them?\nThe sun at its setting is most luminous,\nyet Heaven in its withdrawal of light is swift.\n*Qi* has its contraction and expansion,\nforces have their strength and decline,\ncycles have their rise and fall,\nthings have their giving and taking—\nthis is the nature of affairs,\nnot a matter of desire or aversion.\nThe Classic says:\n*'Gusts of wind do not last the morning,\nsudden rains do not last the day—\neven Heaven and Earth cannot endure long,\nhow much more so mortals?*\nThus, speaking of *qi*,\nwhen the yang reaches its peak,\nthe yin arises—\nis it not that contraction follows expansion?\nSpeaking of force,\nwhen things are at their height,\nthey age—\nis it not that decline follows strength?\nSpeaking of cycles,\nwhen things flourish,\nthey must wither—\nis it not that fall follows rise?\nSpeaking of things,\nwhat is precious must become base—\nis it not that loss follows giving?\nWhen one would act thus,\nmust first act otherwise—\nborrowing human affairs to illustrate Heaven’s principles,\nit is but the natural ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness.\nHeaven has no partiality—\nthe Sage has no partiality.\nLater generations unaware of this Dao\nmistook it for schemes of manipulation,\nyet this is but the interplay of circumstances,\nwhere there is a mind for schemes,\nthe Sage is far removed.\nHow can this chapter’s grand meaning\nbe viewed through the lens of contrivance and action?\"*\n\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*:\n*\"When the eyes are about to fail,\nfirst examine the autumn hairs;\nwhen the ears are about to dull,\nfirst hear the gnat’s flight;\nwhen the body is about to stiffen,\nfirst hasten to bound and leap;\nwhen the heart is about to be confused,\nfirst distinguish right and wrong—\nthus, what does not come to pass\nis not yet reached.*\nThe annotator takes this to mean:\n*'The extremes of high and low,\nthe natural cycles—\nthe Sage abides in the middle,\nwalking the path of harmony,\nfully whole throughout life.'*\nThis Dao is subtle yet profound,\ndifficult yet clear.\"*\n\nThe **Liu** says:\n*\"Expansion must lead to contraction,\nstrength must lead to weakness,\npromotion must lead to decline,\ngiving must lead to taking—\nthis is the natural order of things,\ncalled *subtle clarity*—\nsubtle clarity*—\nthe most refined and evident.\nSome interpret this as a matter of strategy,\nyet the Dao of Heaven is beneficent and does not harm—\nsuch is its nature.\"*\n\nThe **Dong** says:\n*\"The ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness—\na principle of mutual dependence,\nthough its workings may be subtle and hidden,\nits meaning is clear and evident.\nOnly those who dwell in purity, stillness, and weakness\ndo not fall into its schemes.\nSoftness overcomes hardness,\nweakness overcomes strength.\nFish cannot be plucked from the depths,\nand the state’s sharpest tools\nshould not be shown to the people.\"*\n\nThe **Li** says:\n*\"Those who study the Dao,\npreserve the formless,\nhold to the utmost softness,\ncompete with nothing—\nthen naturally know the omens.\"*\n\n「If one were to employ harshness and violence,\nor to rely on stratagems and clever tactics,\nand seek to triumph over all things—\nthis would not be the Dao/Way, indeed.\n\nJust as fish are creatures of water,\nif one seeks to differ from other fish\nand desires to escape the depths—\nis this possible?\n\nSince it is not possible,\nthen humans too cannot rely on stratagems.\nThose who rely on stratagems\ngo against the natural order—\nlike fish leaving the depths, they must perish.\nThe state’s sharpest tools\nshould not be shown to the people,\nas Confucius said:\n*\"One may share the Dao/Way with them,\nbut not one’s stratagems.\"*\nThe same meaning applies here.\n\nThe Sage uses stratagems,\nyet does so by reversing the natural order\nto align with the Dao/Way—\nstill, this should not be done lightly.\nHow much more so for ordinary people—\nshould they not be warned?\n\nThe **He** says:\n*\"Under Heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way is soft and weak,\nencompassing Heaven and Earth,\npenetrating all things.\nThis is how softness and weakness\novercome hardness and strength.\nThus, when humans dwell in the Dao/Way,\nthe Dao/Way dwells in humans,\njust as fish dwell in water,\nand water dwells in fish.\nThe Dao/Way departs from humans, they die;\nwater dries from fish, they perish.\nFish that hide their scales and conceal their fins,\ninhale and exhale the water,\ndo not die—\nhumans who retreat to blessed lands,\ninhale and exhale the *qi*,\ndo not perish either.\nThe state’s sharpest tools\nare the Dao/Way’s hidden principles—\nif one were to reveal them lightly,\nHeaven’s retribution would swiftly arrive.\nThe *Great Cave of Heaven Constitution Scripture* states:\n*\"To reveal what is not meant for humans is called ‘leakage’;\nHeaven’s treasures are profound indeed—\nits hidden principles should not be recklessly disclosed.\"\nThe *Southern Huaxia Scripture* says:\n*\"There are swords of Gou and Yue,\nyet they are kept in their cases,\nnot dared to be used—\nthis is how they are preserved,\nand the meaning is the same.\"*\n\nThe **River Above Master** says:\n*\"Sharp tools are stratagems of the Dao/Way.\nWhen governing the state with stratagems,\none should not show them to officials.\nWhen practicing the Dao/Way for oneself,\none should not reveal them to those unworthy.\"*\n\nThe **Lin** says:\n*\"The depths symbolize the Dao/Way,\nand fish symbolize humans—\njust as fish cannot escape the depths,\nso humans cannot exist outside the Dao/Way.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven** says:\n*\"The Dao/Way is ever without action,\nyet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nall things would transform of their own accord.\"*\n\nThe **He** says:\n*\"In the *Zhuangzi*,\nthough all things differ,\ntheir principles and Dao/Way are not exclusive—\nthus, they are nameless.\nBecause they are nameless,\nthere is no action.\nYet without action, nothing remains undone.\nThe phrase ‘the Dao/Way is ever without action yet nothing remains undone’\nis the great constant of the Dao/Way.\n\nThe ‘constant’ is without desire,\nto observe its subtlety—\nthe ‘constant’ with desire,\nto observe its transformations.\nOnly the constant without desire\nis without action,\nwhile the constant with desire\nis without anything left undone—\nyet the Dao/Way is one.\n\nThis ‘without action yet nothing remains undone’\nis the Dao/Way’s true constant.\nThe Dao/Way is without presence yet without absence—\nif lords and kings could uphold this Dao/Way,\nit would manifest through all things,\nnot requiring transformation yet naturally transforming itself.\"*\n\nThe **Lin** says:\n*\"This chapter aligns with ‘the Dao/Way is ever without name’—\n‘without action yet nothing remains undone’\nis the natural unfolding of the Dao/Way.\nIf lords and kings could uphold this Dao/Way of non-action,\nthen without seeking to transform all things,\nall things would transform themselves.\"*\n\nThe **Lü** says:\n*\"The body’s imitation,\nresponding without deliberation—\nwhen the spirit is too fixed,\nthis is non-action.\nLords and kings,\nentangled in the Nine Sovereigns’ ways,\nif they uphold and do not lose them,\nwill refine their essence into fluid,\nfluid into marrow,\nmarrow into essence,\nessence into the primal pearl,\nand the primal pearl into golden elixir—\nwhat else could this be but the transformation of ten thousand things?\nIf one desires to act upon this transformation,\nI shall restrain them with the nameless *purity*.\nThe nameless *purity* also desires not to act.\nWithout desire, there is stillness—\nand under Heaven, all will naturally align.\"*\n\nThe **He** says:\n*\"Though transformation acts from above and responds below,\nthe mechanism of desire to act or to not act\nis something the Sage holds most carefully.\nThe Sage transforms through divine means,\nmaking people adapt to it—\nnot rushing ahead of its time,\nnor lagging behind—\nits mechanism is thus.\nThe Sage does not claim this as his own merit;\nI shall follow the transformation of non-action,\nreturning to the nameless *purity*.\"*\n\nThe saying *\"to restrain\"* means\nto carve and return to the unadorned—\nto stand alone, solid and unyielding in form,\nthough responsive yet still at its core.\nThis is what is called the nameless *purity*.\n\nThe Dao at its origin\ncannot be named at all.\nThe Sage does not even desire it,\nlet alone the scattered vessels of *purity*,\nwhich bear no extraordinary name.\n\nIf the Dao itself requires no intent,\nhow much more so that which is not the Dao?\nThus, the Sage’s mind is tranquil—\nwhen the mind is unified and steadfast,\nall things submit.\nHow could the world not align?\n\n○ **Master Wu** says:\nTo speak of acting with intent is like stirring—\nto say that one has not yet attained the purity of non-action,\nand yet already waits for things to transform,\nsuddenly harboring intent toward their transformation—\nthe moment this intent arises,\nit is no longer the Dao of non-action.\n\n*\"To restrain\"* means to press down and settle,\npreventing any disturbance.\nThe nameless *purity* refers to the Dao of non-action.\nWhen the impulse to act arises,\none must restrain this intentional desire\nwith this nameless *purity*—\nthat is, to govern oneself through the Dao.\nOnce this nameless *purity* restrains the desire,\nthe desire itself will cease to desire.\nThe stillness that follows is the return to the origin—\nwhen the desire to act is restrained by the Dao,\nthe desiring ceases,\nand the one who acts becomes still.\nThus, though the Sage acts without intent,\nthe world will align of its own accord.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says:\nWithin oneself, the moment a thought stirs,\nit is called *emotion*—\nwhen emotion moves, all transformations arise.\nOnce the thought has slipped through,\none must urgently reflect back,\nextinguishing the restless mind,\nrestoring the pure simplicity,\nand restraining it with *purity*—\nonly then may one unify the nature.\nHence it is said:\n*\"When transformation stirs to act,\nI shall restrain it with the nameless purity.\"*\n\nMoreover, the Dao is originally formless;\n*purity* is but a borrowed term.\nThe Sage fears that even this may become rigid and fixed,\nthat clinging to *purity* for use\nmight lead to exhaustion beyond remedy.\nThus, he declares:\nTo let the world’s myriad forms be,\nthe mind must be empty;\nto respond to the world’s myriad movements,\nthe mind must be still.\nOnly by suppressing desire to empty the nature,\nand severing learning to empty the mind,\ncan one refine the self—\nwithout obstruction, nothing is unattained;\ncan one govern the nature—\nwithout exception, nothing is unachievable.\nThus, the world will naturally settle and align.\n\n○ **Master Li** says:\nHeaven and Earth act without doing,\nand all things emerge.\nThe Sage acts without doing,\nand all people thrive in peace.\n\nSpeaking of cultivation and refinement,\nthere is no deliberate action—\nin moments of tranquility,\npreserve the formless.\nAt the slightest movement,\none must first become aware,\nand upon awareness,\nrestrain it with the nameless *purity*.\n*Purity* is formless;\nit is also called *nameless*—\nmeaning *emptiness*.\n\n*(End of Volume Five of the Collected Commentaries on the Dao De Jing)*\n*(Beginning of Volume Six of the Collected Commentaries on the Dao De Jing)*\n\nThe **Way** of supreme virtue is not virtue,\nthus it has virtue.\nThe **Way** of inferior virtue does not abandon virtue,\nthus it lacks virtue.\nThe **Way** of supreme virtue acts without action—\nyet

of supreme righteousness acts yet nothing is accomplished.\nThe **Way** of supreme propriety acts yet none respond,\nand so they roll up their sleeves and force it upon them.\n\n○ **Master He** says:\nThe ancients dwelled in **mixed chaos**,\nand with the world became **dull and tranquil**.\nThough people may have wisdom,\nthey had no use for it—\nthis is called **ultimate unity**,\nwhere none know to act yet all abides in **constant naturalness**.\n\nWhen virtue declined,\nat the time of **Tang and Yú**,\nthey began to establish laws for the world,\ndissipating **purity** and scattering **simplicity**,\nabandoning the **Dao** for the sake of goodness,\nand making virtue perilous through conduct.\nThen they discarded **nature** and followed the **heart**.\n\nThe **heart** gives rise to **heart-awareness** and **mind-knowing**,\nyet it was insufficient to govern the world—\nso they adorned it with **culture** and enriched it with **learning**.\nWhen **culture** extinguishes **substance**,\nand **learning** drowns the **heart**,\nthen the people began to be bewildered and disordered,\nunable to return to their original **nature** and **emotions**.\n\nThis chapter’s essence lies entirely here.\nSupreme virtue not being virtue—\nthat is **mixed chaos** and **dull tranquility**.\nInferior virtue not abandoning virtue yet lacking it—\nthen the doer is ruined, the grasp is lost.\n\nSupreme virtue acting without action—\nthat is **ultimate unity** in **naturalness**.\nInferior virtue acting with action—\nthat is what is called “beginning to act for the world.”\n\nSupreme benevolence acting yet nothing is accomplished—\n**ultimate benevolence** has no favorites,\nand its distance from virtue is still slight.\n\nSupreme righteousness acting yet nothing is accomplished—\nwhen righteousness governs actions,\nthen inferior benevolence is already one rank below.\n\nIf one views **virtue** and **righteousness** through the lens of **moral power**,\nthen this is what is meant by\n“abandoning the **Dao** for goodness” and\n“making virtue perilous through conduct.”\n\nWhen it says “not virtue,” and “nothing is accomplished,”—\nall are without **heart**,\nacting without purpose is called **Heaven**.\nWhen it says “not abandoning virtue,” and “nothing is accomplished,”—\nall are with **heart**,\nacting with purpose is called **human**.\n\nSupreme propriety acting yet none respond—\nthis is already one rank below inferior righteousness,\nadorned with **culture** and **rites**.\nIn **loyalty** and **trustworthiness**, it is too thin;\nenriched with **learning**, it is too ornate.\nIts distance from **nature** grows ever farther.\n\nSupreme propriety—\nthat is **excessive rites**.\nWhen rewards are lavish, the response must be lavish,\nyet if the response does not match the reward,\nthen strife arises from it.\nRolling up the sleeves—\na gesture of forcibly pulling away—\nis the mark of one who violates propriety.\n“Force” (扔) is “pull,”\nbut the character is incorrect.\n\n○ **Master Lin** says:\n“Acting yet none respond”—\nthis is compelling the people yet they do not follow.\n“Force” (扔) is “pull,”\nwhen the people do not follow yet one forcibly drags them by hand.\nIt is a strong and violent pulling.\nThis merely describes the act of compelling the people,\nhence it says: *“roll up the sleeves and force it upon them.”*\n\n○ **Master Li** says:\nThe previous chapter spoke of **constant non-action**,\nso next it speaks of *“the **Way** of supreme virtue is not virtue.”*\nSupreme virtue is non-action,\nthus it aligns with the **Dao**.\nInferior virtue is action and does not align with the **Dao**.\n**Benevolence** and **righteousness** are still close to virtue,\nand can serve as steps toward the **Dao**.\n**Rites** are purely action;\nwhen **rites** are used to harmonize all,\nthey instead fail to harmonize—\nfor all action must eventually falter.\nIf one holds to them without faltering,\nthey can gradually lead one to a better state.\nFrom **benevolence** to return to **virtue**,\nfrom **virtue** to return to the **Dao**,\ndirectly reaching **non-action**.\n\n○ **Master Qin of Huáihǎi** says:\n**Virtue** and **power** are the fullness of **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **rites**, and **wisdom**,\nwhile **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **rites**, and **wisdom** are but aspects of **virtue** and **power**,\nwith the **Dao** as their foundation,\nand **benevolence** and **righteousness** as their application.\nThus, when the **Dao** is lost, **virtue** follows;\nwhen **virtue** is lost, **benevolence** follows;\nwhen **benevolence** is lost, **righteousness** follows;\nwhen **righteousness** is lost, **rites** follow.\n\n**Rites** are the thinnest of **loyalty** and **trustworthiness**,\nand the origin of disorder.\n**Preconceived knowing** is the ornate aspect of the **Dao**,\nand the beginning of **folly**.\n**Master He** says:\nDisorder begins with folly—\nthis is the utmost of how **rites** and **wisdom** lead to ruin.\nThe *Zhuāngzi* clearly enumerates these five stages from *“when the **Dao** is lost, **virtue** follows”*,\nand says: *“Now they make these things into objects of pursuit,\nand to return to the root is not so easy.\nHow simple it is! How simple it is—\nonly the **Great Person** can do it.”*\n\nThough it says *“so”*,\nit also says: *“Hidden yet cannot fail to act—this is **rites**.\nDistant yet cannot fail to dwell upon—this is **righteousness**.\nNear yet cannot fail to broaden—this is **benevolence**.\nModerate yet cannot fail to accumulate—this is **rites**.\nCentral yet cannot fail to elevate—this is **virtue**.\nOne yet cannot fail to simplify—this is the **Dao**.*\nThough these have a sequence of high and low, first and last,\nwhen the Sage employs them all,\nwhat is not the **Dao**?\n\nOnce there was a **Master of Mysterious Transformation** who said:\nThe **Dao** is the subtle essence of all things,\nand when spoken of, it is called **virtue**—\nthe totality of the **Two Poles** (yin and yang).\nTo attain it at the highest is the **Dao**,\nto attain it in the middle is **benevolence** and **righteousness**,\nto attain it in the lower is **rites** and **wisdom**.\nTo attain it in the cold and lose it—\nthat is not **human**.\nThis statement is the most concise and clear.\n\n○ **Master Lǚ** says:\nThe **Dao** is the **substance** of **virtue**,\nand **virtue** is the **application** of the **Dao**.\n**Benevolence** and **righteousness** arise from the **heart**,\nand are worthy of praise.\nBut when it comes to **rites**,\nthey grow ever more distant from **nature**,\nornate yet lacking in substance.\nTo engage in elaborate **rites** and trivial details\nwithout seeking their foundation—\n**loyalty** and **trustworthiness** grow ever thinner,\nthough outwardly they may gleam.\nTo follow them brings order,\nto oppose them brings chaos—\nnot even a hair’s breadth can intervene.\nIs this not the origin of disorder?\n\nThus it is said:\nWhen the **Three Sovereigns** had the **Dao**,\nthey did not know that the **Dao** transformed into the **virtue** of the **Five Emperors**.\nWhen the **Five Emperors** had **virtue**,\nthey did not know that **virtue** transformed into the **benevolence** and **righteousness** of the **Three Kings**.\nWhen the **Three Kings** had **benevolence** and **righteousness**,\nthey did not know that **benevolence** and **righteousness** transformed into the **wars** of **Qín-Hàn**.\nThis is what is meant.\n\nMoreover, the common people take **wisdom** as a chisel,\npursuing superficial ornamentation.\nThough they think themselves perceptive,\nthey do not realize that **ultimate folly** begins from here.\nHence it says:\n*“Preconceived knowing* is the ornate aspect of the **Dao**,\nand the beginning of **folly**.”*\n\nMr. Wu says: **\"Loyalty and sincerity\"** are the depth of **virtue**, gradually thinning as they transform—once diminished, they become **benevolence**; twice diminished, they become **righteousness**; thrice diminished, they become **rites**. Thus, the profound **virtue** of loyalty and sincerity grows shallow. **Rites** seek to bring order without chaos, yet they instead become the foundation of disorder—hence, they are called *\"the origin of chaos.\"*\n\n*\"Preconceived knowing\"* is akin to foresight—it refers to **wisdom**. The **Dao** is like the fruit of a tree: before its birth, its essence lies within, its embryo yet unseen. Once born, **virtue** is its root, **benevolence** its trunk, **righteousness** its branches, **rites** its leaves, and **wisdom** its blossom. All arise from the **Dao**. **Wisdom** seeks to be enlightened yet avoids folly, but instead it gives rise to folly—hence, it is called *\"the beginning of folly.\"*\n\nMr. Li says: *\"Preconceived knowing\"* is **discernment**; **discernment** is the first deviation from the **Dao**, hence it is called *\"the ornament of the **Dao**,\"* and those who follow the **Dao** do not dwell there. Thus, the noble man abides in what is profound, not in what is shallow; he rests in substance, not in ornament. Hence, one discards the former and takes the latter.\n\nMr. He says: To abide in profundity and not in shallowness means to honor **virtue** over **rites**; to rest in substance and not in ornament means to embody the **Dao** without relying on **wisdom**. The former is called shallow and ornamental; the latter, profound and true. Again, he says: This passage divides the six terms—**Dao**, **virtue**, **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **rites**, and **wisdom**—with **Dao** being nameless and **virtue** named. From **virtue** arise **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **rites**, and **wisdom**, each descent growing more refined, hence this chapter ranks **Dao** as first, **virtue** as second, **benevolence** as third, **righteousness** as fourth, **rites** as fifth, and **wisdom** as sixth.\n\nMr. Lü says: The sage, witnessing the **Dao** in existence, values purity and profundity, discarding superficiality. He anchors himself in sincerity, rejecting ornamentation. By abandoning the superficial trappings of **rites** and embracing the vast body of the **Dao**, the world is governed. It is like cultivating one’s life: returning to simplicity, earnest as uncarved wood—abiding in profundity. Walking where there is no path, moving without trace—avoiding shallowness. Emerging without gate, entering the boundless—resting in substance. Focusing the spirit, suppressing perception—discarding ornament. To abandon superficiality and take profundity—what could be more attainable?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\nIn ancient times, those who attained **Oneness**—\nthe heavens attained **Oneness** and became clear,\nthe earth attained **Oneness** and became tranquil,\nthe spirit attained **Oneness** and became numinous,\nthe **valleys** attained **Oneness** and became full,\nall things attained **Oneness** and were born,\nand the sovereigns attained **Oneness** to uphold the **Dao** for all under heaven.\nThis is how **Oneness** is achieved.\n\nMr. He says: In *Zhuangzi*, it is said that *\"the Primordial had neither being nor non-being, and the nameless gave rise to **Oneness**.\"* Before **Oneness** took form, those who attained it in antiquity placed it at the chapter’s beginning, declaring that **Oneness** as the **Dao** has existed since ancient times. **Oneness** is what the **Dao** generates; it is not called \"attaining the **Dao**\" but \"attaining **Oneness**,\" revealing the **Dao’s** supremacy—its singularity, unpaired, unmatched by anything. *Liezi* speaks of the \"uncarved,\" doubting the solitary; this speaks of **Oneness**’s essence. Hence, it is said: *\"Doubt the solitary, for the **Dao** cannot be exhausted.\"*\n\nMr. Lin says: **Oneness** is the **Dao**. The heavens, through it, are clear and manifest their forms; the earth, through it, is stable and bears all things; the spirit, through it, is empty yet numinous; the **valleys**, through it, are empty yet full. All things, through it, are born. The sovereigns, through it, uphold rectitude for all under heaven. Their attainment of it is what brings clarity, tranquility, numinosity, fullness, birth, and rectitude.\n\nMr. Lü says: Those who attained **Oneness** in antiquity—after the Primordial **Dao** had divided—were able to make the heavens clear, the earth tranquil, the spirit numinous, the **valleys** full, all things born, and the sovereigns rectify the world. There is no other reason: they attained the marvelous workings of **One Qi**. **One Qi** is unmatched; harmonized with the world, it is the child of the Great **Dao**, the mother of numinous clarity, the precursor of the Undifferentiated, and the ancestor of all transformations. Constant above and below, unchanging from ancient to modern, hence the sage draws near by examining himself.\n\nThe heavens are the rounded symbol of the head; attaining it makes the beard turn black, the eyes bright, the ears sharp—all senses become keen and clear. The earth is the true yellow field; attaining it makes one bear all things, nurture all growth, and remain stable and unmoving. The spirit attains it by chewing the six breaths, condensing the embryonic essence, and then transforming into numinous clarity. The **valleys** attain it, filling the brain and marrow, making the celestial **valleys** empty yet full, generating the true purple essence. All things—the six viscera, five organs, nine orifices, and hundred bones—attaining it make the seven fluids flow freely, the five entrails firm, the **Qi** harmonized and nourishing, thus enabling longevity and enduring vision. The sovereigns are the primordial spirit and heart-mind; attaining it elevates one instantly to sainthood, rectifying the form. There is no other reason: all is the work of **One Qi**.\n\nMr. Wu says: **Oneness** is the **virtue** of the void. In the previous chapter, it is called *\"embracing **Oneness**,\"* *\"being **Oneness**.\"* In later chapters, it is said that *\"the **Dao** generates **Oneness**.\"* All refer to this. *Zhuangzi* calls it *\"Great Unity\"* (*Taiyi*), yet also simply *\"**Oneness**.\"* This is the natural work of the **Dao**; its operation is empty yet not full, yielding yet not grasping, soft yet not rigid—all as stated in the previous chapter, now fully revealed.\n\nThe one attained is called attaining this **Oneness** as **virtue**; the *yi* [以] is said because of this, one attains such effects. The clarity of Heaven, the tranquility of Earth, the responsiveness of Spirit, the fullness of the grains, the ceaseless generation of all things—how the sovereigns stand above the world—all are due to attaining this **Oneness**.\n\nHeaven, without this **Oneness** to clarify, would fear splitting. Earth, without this **Oneness** to tranquilize, would fear erupting. Spirit, without this **Oneness** to enliven, would fear fading. The grains, without this **Oneness** to fill, would fear exhaustion. All things, without this **Oneness** to generate, would fear extinction. The sovereigns, without this **Oneness** to uphold their rectitude and nobility, would fear collapse.\n\nMr. He says: Clarity belongs to Heaven. If one does not know this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, to clarify it, then day would be as dark as night, and clarity would split asunder. Tranquility belongs to Earth. If one does not know this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, to tranquilize it, then mountains would crumble and rivers dry up, and tranquility would erupt in chaos. Responsiveness belongs to Spirit. If one does not know this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, to enliven it, then Spirit would lose its responsiveness and fade away. Fullness belongs to the grains. If one does not know this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, to fill them, then the grains would not be full and would wither away. Generation belongs to all things. If one does not know this **Dao**, this **Oneness**, to generate them, then their generation would fail and they would decay.\n\nAs for the sovereigns, with one body ruling above the subjects, attaining **Oneness** and embodying **Oneness**—only then can they uphold rectitude for the world. If not for this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, then those in high positions would be in peril, those with virtue of two or three would face disaster, and the calamity of decline would surely come—how could one not be warned?\n\nRectitude is uprightness.\n\nMr. Lü says: Heaven is the accumulated **virtue** of Yang, symbolizing the sovereign. If it lacks clarity, then Yin and Yang would be disordered, the cosmic order would collapse, **Oneness** would not flow, and signs of splitting would appear. Earth is the accumulated **virtue** of Yin, symbolizing the ministers. If it lacks tranquility, then rigidity and softness would falter, mountains and rivers would crumble, **Oneness** would not be preserved, and signs of eruption would manifest. Spirit is the unfathomable interplay of Yin and Yang. If it lacks responsiveness, then calamities and omens would arise, and **Oneness** would not reside, bringing the time of decline.\n\nThe grains are empty yet contain all things. If they lack fullness, then the flow of nourishment would fail, and the fear of collapse would arise. **Oneness** would not be full, and the peril of exhaustion would begin. All things have form. If they lack generation, they would wither and dry up. **Oneness** would disperse, and the time of extinction would come.\n\nThe sovereign unites the Three Realms and possesses all things. If he lacks rectitude and nobility, then officials would not fulfill their duties, the four seas would not submit, and the calamity of decline would follow.\n\nMoreover, within a man’s body, the most Yang aspect shines above—from the Heavenly Pillar, the first vertebra, to the Jade Capital above the Heavenly Axis—all is Heaven. If it lacks clarity, then the marrow would diminish, teeth would fall out, vision would dim, and the form would decay and split. If his Earth lacks tranquility, then the true soil would dry up, the yellow sprouts would not grow, and the vital essences would erupt and dissipate. If his Spirit lacks responsiveness, then the embryo would wither, the prenatal sage would scatter, the seven fluids would not flow, and they would eventually exhaust and perish. If his myriad things do not generate, then the joints would lack vitality, the organs would weaken, and he would end in stillness and extinction. If the sovereign relies on his high nobility, then the Cinnabar Field would not be upright, the true nature would stray, the heart-shadow would become askew, and he would fear collapse.\n\nMr. Lin says: *Klie* [裂] means to split apart. *Fa* [发] means to move restlessly. *Xie* [歇] means to fade and lose responsiveness. *Jie* [竭] means exhaustion. The empty can receive; the non-empty stops and cannot receive.\n\n*Ju* [蹶] means to topple. To be in a high and noble position without this **Oneness** is to court collapse.\n\nThus, nobility depends on humility as its foundation, and height depends on lowliness as its base. Therefore, the sovereigns call themselves \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" and \"without grains.\" Is this not taking humility as the foundation?\n\nMr. Lin says: The phrases \"nobility depends on humility\" and \"height depends on lowliness\" are merely metaphors. Without lowliness, how could there be nobility? Without the base, how could there be height? Lowliness and humility are the foundation of nobility and height.\n\nThe sovereign’s self-designation—\"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" \"without grains\"—are all words of self-debasement, also used as metaphors for emptiness and selflessness. Is this not so? Saying, \"Is this not so?\"—how could it be otherwise? These two words are a marvel of literary style.\n\nMr. Wu says: This chapter speaks of six things in parallel, and below it elaborates on the \"noble\" and \"high\" from above, specifically addressing the sovereigns. The sovereign’s position is noble and high, yet the **virtue** of **Oneness** does not seek fullness—only by placing oneself in lowliness can one attain it. \"Lonely\" is like an orphan without a father, \"widowed\" is like a woman without a husband, and \"without grains\" means \"not virtuous\"—these are all unflattering names no one would wish to bear, yet the sovereigns use them to describe themselves, thus placing themselves in lowliness.\n\nEarlier, it was said, \"Lowliness is the base, humility is the foundation,\" and later only \"humility is the foundation\"—this is a concise way of encompassing both.\n\nMr. Li says: Is this not so? How could it be otherwise?\n\nMr. He says: Nobility originates from humility, height is founded on lowliness. Therefore, the sovereigns call themselves \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" \"without assistance,\" \"without virtue,\" and \"without grains\"—thus returning to their roots without losing the **Dao**.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says: \"Constantly uphold **Oneness** in **virtue**, use humility to regulate rites. The steadfastness of constant **virtue**, the power of humble **virtue**.\" This is the Daoist **Dao** of the \"feminine **Oneness**\"—guarding simplicity while applying broadly.\n\nThus, \"attaining ten chariots without desiring chariots\" [致数车无车], originally \"attaining ten praises without desiring praise\" [致数誉无誉]—the character *yù* [誉] was mistaken.\n\nMr. Lin says: \"Attaining ten chariots without desiring chariots\" [致数车无车]—the original text reads \"attaining ten praises without desiring praise\" [致数誉无誉], where *yù* [誉] was incorrectly written.\n\nThis passage is a metaphor, and if *yù* [誉] is used, the following lines—\"like jade, like stone\"—lose their connection in meaning.\n\nMr. Lin says: \"The term *shù chē* [数车] refers to the components of a chariot—none of which alone is called a chariot. Similarly, the *shù* [数] of my single body—none of which alone is called *wǒ* [我, 'I']. When the hub and spokes unite, it is called a chariot; when the Four Great Elements unite, it is called *wǒ*. To not desire to be like jade or like stone is to forget both nobility and humility, embracing only Oneness.\"\n\nMr. He says: \"To focus on *shù chē* while splitting over the distinction of names and numbers, or to fixate on jade and stone while favoring the extremes of nobility and lowliness, is to stray from the Dao of Oneness and origin. As *Zhuangzi* states: *All things are equal in Oneness—what is short, what is long?* Observing things through the Dao, what is noble, what is base? This is the way. Thus, the chapter’s concluding metaphor serves as a warning.\n\nMr. Chái says: \"The wheels, spokes, and other parts are the humble components of a chariot, yet without them, no chariot exists. Counting all these parts, none alone is called a chariot—hence, *shù chē wú chē*. Jade emerging from stone—one does not exalt jade over stone, for the longer it endures, the more it forgets its origin.\"\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Returning is the Dao’s movement; the yielding is the Dao’s use.**\n\nMr. Lin says: \"Returning is returning to origin, to stillness. Stillness is the source from which movement arises—just as *The Classic of Changes* says: *Gèn* [艮] completes both beginning and end. Only by yielding can one grow strong; clinging to strength alone leads to fracture. Movement relies on stillness as its function; strength relies on yielding as its use.\"\n\nMr. Wú says: \"The Dao’s utmost stillness returns to the Dao, hence movement arises. The Dao’s original emptiness returns to the Dao, hence existence emerges. Thus, the root of emptiness and indistinctness, the origin from which all things spring—bound by the mechanisms of emergence and return, confined to the realms of movement and stillness—these are the body and function of the Dao.\n\nTo grasp the true nature of things, one must uphold their origin. To govern the transformations of things, one must uphold their fundamental principle. Thus, when movement generates life, if one does not align with its transformation, one knows that emergence must return to return. If one does not align with its passage, one knows that movement must return to stillness. Observing things as they emerge, one sees they must ultimately return. Observing things as they move, one sees they must ultimately still. Thus, the heart of Heaven and Earth becomes visible.\n\nIn spring and summer, all things flourish in abundance, their roots and shoots bursting forth, their flowers and fruits unfolding outward—emerging and living. Is this not returning to movement? In autumn and winter, all things shed their flowers and bear fruit, withdrawing inward, returning to their innate nature, orderly yet unforced. Is this not yielding in use?\n\nConsider the body: to cultivate longevity, one must recognize the origin of life. To seek immortality, one must understand the mechanisms of emergence and return—this is called returning, this is called movement and stillness. Returning is the restoration of the true essence; movement is the activation of Heaven’s inherent potential.\n\nFrom the first emergence of *yīn-yáng* [一阳], within the stillness of definition, the pivot turns, the currents flow—grasp the meaning of seven returns, govern and supplement the Three Fields, circulate the Hundred Vessels. Without movement, one cannot restore life—thus, *The Returning is the Dao’s movement*.\n\nThe Dao is formless and soundless. Only the yielding can subdue the rigid; only the weak can subdue the strong. Thus, one must steadfastly guard the feminine and stillness, like an infant before it speaks. Moreover, nothing in the world is as yielding and weak as water—water is surpassed only by *qi*, and *qi* is surpassed only by the Dao. The yielding and weak of Dao-*qi*-spirit-water penetrates metal and stone, melts the sharp, grinds the hard—nothing it cannot enter. Thus, *The yielding is the Dao’s use*.\n\nMr. Lin says: \"Returning is the Dao’s movement—the spirit emerges and is immediately drawn back. Yielding is the Dao’s use—concentrating *qi* to achieve softness.\"\n\nAll things under Heaven are born of *yǒu* [有], and *yǒu* is born of *wú* [无].\n\nMr. Lin says: \"Only after Heaven and Earth exist do all things emerge—thus, things are born of *yǒu*. Yet who gave birth to Heaven and Earth? At their origin, they emerged from the Great Emptiness—thus, they are born of *wú*. Through movement, stillness, strength, and yielding, we speak of the beginning of *yǒu* and *wú*.\"\n\nMr. Lǚ says: \"All things under Heaven—*yǒu* and *wú* generate each other, alternately emerging and returning, without end. Without *yǒu*, one cannot reveal *wú*; without *wú*, one cannot generate *yǒu*. All things are born within Heaven and Earth—thus, they arise from *yǒu*. Heaven and Earth take form within the Great Emptiness—thus, *yǒu* arises from *wú*. When *yǒu* is born, it returns to non-being; when form is born, it returns to formlessness. The mutual generation of *yǒu* and *wú* is like a cycle, and the meaning of returning is profound indeed.\n\nThe Sage deeply comprehends this principle. Observing water, one does not watch its flow but its return-flow. Observing wood, one does not watch its blossoms but their withering—thus, though things differ in myriad ways, the Dao is evident upon sight.\n\nYet Heaven and Earth are the parents of all things, and humans are the most refined of all things. What is *yǒu* in us is form; what is *wú* in us is spirit. The embryo forms our shape—*yǒu* born of *wú*. The Hundred Spirits arise from the body—*wú* born of *yǒu*.\n\nThus, true *yǒu* is not *yǒu*; true *wú* is not *wú*. Those who grasp this meaning naturally harmonize with true *yǒu* and true *wú*.\"\n\nMr. He says: \"All things under Heaven are born of *yǒu*, and *yǒu* is born of *wú*—this is seeking the origin. Only after Heaven and Earth exist do all things emerge. Heaven and Earth are the first origin of all things. Before Heaven and Earth, there was the undifferentiated chaos—this too is the first origin of Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Wú* generates *yǒu*; formlessness generates form. When *yǒu* is born, it returns to non-being; when form is born, it returns to formlessness. Beginning from *wú*, it disperses into *yǒu*; ending in *yǒu*, it returns to *wú*. Thus, the Dao’s simplicity does not ultimately disperse into things. Those who drift and forget returning are destined to lose strength and stray far from the Dao.\"\n\nMr. Li says: \"All things under Heaven are born of *yǒu*, and thus *yǒu* is named the Mother of all things. *Yǒu* is born of *wú*, and thus *wú* is named the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n\nChapter Forty-One: The superior man, hearing the Dao, strives and practices it. The mediocre man, hearing the Dao, is uncertain whether it exists or not. The inferior man, hearing the Dao, laughs at it—if he does not laugh, it is not the Dao.\n\nMr. Lin says: \"To strive and practice it means that upon hearing, one must believe. To be uncertain whether it exists or not means to both believe and doubt, to regard it as both *yǒu* and *wú*. The most vulgar and coarse of men will simply laugh at it. Only when the lowest of men laugh at it does one truly see the Dao’s exalted nature.\n\nHan Yu’s critique of literature states: 'If people laugh at it, one should take it as joy—how much more so for the Dao.'\n\nMr. He says: \"The Dao is natural; those who practice it can attain it, those who hear it can speak of it. Those who practice it diligently are the superior among men. The common man seeks the Dao without sincerity or depth, wavering between existence and non-existence, clinging to thoughts and intentions—one in ten thousand may achieve it. As for the vulgar and shallow of the world, though they may appear modest and weak, they laugh at the void as absurd, yet their laughter is insufficient to expose the Dao’s greatness, for those who truly know the Dao are rare.\n\nMr. Lü says: \"The superior man is endowed with pure and thick virtue, penetrating profound principles. Hearing the Dao, he instantly comprehends and believes without doubt, firmly resolving to practice it, fearing only that he cannot attain it. Thus it is said: *strive and practice it*.\n\nThe mediocre man is of moderate nature, capable of both high and low. Initially delighted, he later grows weary; at first diligent, he later becomes lazy. Hearing the Dao, he hesitates and doubts, unable to decide between acceptance and rejection. Though he wishes to advance, he lacks the resolve to act; though he wishes to retreat, he still hesitates. Thus it is said: *uncertain whether it exists or not*.\n\nThe inferior man is of impure and muddled nature, failing to grasp ultimate truth. Hearing the Dao, he deems it absurd and ridiculous, not only disbelieving but laughing and condemning it. Yet if the inferior do not laugh at it, how can it be called the pure and unadulterated Dao?\n\nTherefore, it is said: *To establish speech, the Dao appears obscure; to advance the Dao, it seems to retreat; the great Dao appears common; virtue’s height resembles a valley; supreme brightness seems like shame; vast virtue appears insufficient; established virtue seems like theft; true substance seems corrupted; the greatest square has no corners; great vessels take long to form; great sound is rare in tone; great form is shapeless.*\n\nMr. Lin says: *To establish speech* means to found doctrine. The scholars of antiquity, in their teachings—from *The Dao appears obscure* onward—have spoken these words. These are merely rhetorical devices, not original to me but found in the ancients.\n\n*The Dao appears obscure* means that only through obscurity does clarity arise. The previous chapter states: *Self-evident is not true clarity*, and again: *Not self-evident, hence clarity*. This is the same.\n\n*To advance the Dao, it seems to retreat*—retreat is true advancement. *Ji* (夷) means level; the great Dao is level, without distinction. *Rú* (类) means same; it harmonizes with the dust, blending light with the mundane.\n\n*Virtue’s height resembles a valley*—to be empty and not self-aggrandizing. *Supreme brightness seems like shame*—not dazzlingly distinct. *Vast virtue appears insufficient*—if one is self-sufficient, it becomes narrow. *Theft*—to desire to act but dare not. To establish virtue is to have purpose; to establish it through what one dares not do is how virtue is truly built. *True substance seems corrupted*—pure and unchanging substance, yet appearing as if it were ever-shifting. This too conveys the meaning of sufficiency without self-sufficiency.\n\n*The greatest square*—this is the boundless void. Though the void has east, west, south, and north, who can perceive its corners? *Great vessels take long to form*—like casting a tripod; how could it be hastened? *Great sound is rare in tone*—among the sounds between Heaven and Earth, none surpass the wind and thunder, yet they are not always present. *Rare* means seldom seen. *Great form*—Heaven and Earth. The *Yijing* says: *No symbol is greater than Heaven and Earth*—who can fully perceive their form?\n\nMr. He says: *To establish speech*—the ancients who founded doctrine, as mentioned below, were all ridiculed by the world, yet the great Dao endured. *The Dao appears obscure*—great enlightenment is like no enlightenment. *To advance the Dao, it seems to retreat*—great courage is like no courage. *The great Dao appears common*—equality is like no equality. *Virtue’s height resembles a valley*—substance is like emptiness. *Supreme brightness seems like shame*—purity is like impurity. *Vast virtue appears insufficient*—having abundance yet not daring to exhaust it. *Established virtue seems like theft*—established in Heaven and Earth yet acting like one who seeks fleeting ease. *True substance seems corrupted*—substance like gold and stone, yet appearing to decay over time. *The greatest square has no corners*—no doors, no rooms. *Great vessels take long to form*—uncarved, unpolished. *Great sound is rare in tone*—not in tune with pitch pipes. *Great form is shapeless*—separate from color, separate from name.\n\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless. Only the Dao can be freely given and fully realized. Mr. Lin says: *The Dao is hidden and nameless*—it cannot be named. *To give* means to bestow upon others. Those with the Dao can give to others without possessing it themselves. *Realized*—the great fulfillment of the Dao, fulfilling self and others, and only then is it called great fulfillment.\n\n「○ Master He says: *The Nameless*—cannot be pointed out and named, hence there are things like those described above that cannot be fully captured by words. Yet though the Dao is nameless, it exists and is truly good at lending and bringing to fruition. *Lending*—bestowing and applying through resonance, universally present in all beings, pervasively encompassing all things, like Heaven’s bestowal and Earth’s nurturing. The small fulfills the small, the great fulfills the great—what is there that is not the Dao?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: The Dao transforms and lends to all things, yet the people do not rely upon it. It holds nothing aloft to claim fame, letting things rejoice on their own. Standing in the unfathomable, it wanders in the boundless—this is the Dao.\n\n**Chapter 42:** *The Dao gives rise to One, One to Two, Two to Three, Three to all things.* All things bear yin within them and embrace yang, blending the *qi* to achieve harmony.\n\n○ Master He says: *The void gives rise to Nature, Nature to the Dao, the Dao to One, One to Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth to all things.* All things arise from One and are fulfilled, receiving the subtle and wondrous *qi* and transformations. Whether it is beings or things, turning away from cold toward warmth, from darkness toward light, from evil toward good—all are expressions of *bearing yin and embracing yang*. *Embracing yang* is the same as *embracing One*, the Dao’s breath of life and its transformations. Man shares with Heaven and Earth as the threefold realm, yet among all things, he is the most responsive. Hence, man is Heaven’s trust of *shen* (spirit), Earth’s bestowal of *jing* (essence), and the *chong* (intermediary) and *he* (harmonious) *qi*’s nurturing. Man is precious in guarding his *qi*, preserving his essence, and cherishing his spirit—thus standing with Heaven and Earth, his means of sustaining the *chong* and *he*, to be modest rather than full. The *Classic of Documents* says: *Fullness invites loss, modesty invites gain*—this is the Dao of Heaven.\n\n○ Master Lin says: *One*—the Supreme Ultimate. *Two*—Heaven and Earth. *Three*—the Three Realms. All things arise from the void. The Dao is the origin of all things, the principle of Nature. Once the Three Ultimate realms are established, then all things are born. The birth of all things depends on bearing and embracing yin and yang *qi*, moving through the void’s harmony. This is how harmony comes to be.*\n\n○ Master Lü says: *The Dao gives rise to One Qi, One Qi to Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth to all things.* The reason the Dao gives rise to One is that the Supreme Ultimate was yet undifferentiated, a pure and undivided One Qi. *One gives rise to Two*—meaning that clarity and turbidity were divided, and thus Heaven and Earth took their places. As the *Yijing* says: *The Great Ultimate generates the Two Principles*—this is correct. *Majestic and resplendent it emerges from Heaven; solemn and austere it issues from Earth.* The two intermingle to form harmony, hence the order of humanity is achieved. *One yin, one yang*—this is the Dao. Saying *bearing and embracing*—they cannot be separated for even an instant. What can be separated is not the Dao. Those who cultivate and nourish understand that the moon is the mother of all yin, and the sun is the father of all yang. Therefore, those who bear and embrace should delight in absorbing Heaven’s light and chew upon the harmonious *qi*, letting the Heavenly Essence fill and overflow, the two luminaries intertwine, and all spirits rest in peace. Entering and exiting the primal transformations, they soar in pairs to the *Yuqing* (Jade Purity).\n\n○ Master Dong says: *For all living things, their backs face stillness*—belonging to yin’s quiet nature. *Their mouths, noses, ears, and eyes reside at the front*—belonging to yang’s dynamic nature. Hence it is said: *bearing yin while embracing yang*. Like plants, they turn their backs to cold and face warmth. The *chong* (intermediary) *qi* moves between them, and when spoken of generally, the spirit is yang while the substance is yin. The spirit moves within—this is *embracing*, while the substance appears without—this is *bearing*. The *qi* is yang in motion and yin in stillness, then balanced by the harmonious center, blending within form and substance, the mechanism upon which the spirit rides.\n\nWhat man hates most are *孤寡不谷* (loneliness, widowhood, and barrenness), yet kings and nobles take these as their titles. Hence, some things are diminished to gain, while others are gained to diminish. Master He says: *Kings and nobles who claim loneliness, widowhood, and barrenness*—do so by adopting the guise of being unsupported and unassisted. This is their name for self-humility and preservation.\n\nThe three titles are what man most detests, yet they are also what man uses to teach. Those in high station fall, the arrogant perish—this is the natural course. Yet within loss there is gain, and within gain there is loss. This is the changing nature of things. Hence, the Sage acts as the master of the Three Realms, holding the *chong* (intermediary) and containing the harmony, willingly enduring what man hates, willingly receiving what things diminish. How does he know that those who humble themselves are not exalted, those who retreat are not surpassed? Evil is not always evil, loss is not always loss. The *Classic* says: *The Dao is void yet its use is inexhaustible; fullness is its opposite.* The *Yijing* says: *What is great cannot be filled*—hence it is received with modesty, for modesty is the opposite of fullness.\n\n○ Master Lin says: *What man hates most*—nothing compares to *孤寡不谷* (loneliness, widowhood, and barrenness), yet kings and nobles take these as their titles. This is also an analogy for the Sage’s self-humility and self-abasement. Its meaning is that Heaven, Earth, and man all arise from the void. All things take yin and yang as their foundation, yet their means of birth are all the harmonious *qi* of the void. Those who study the Dao should embody this meaning, thus valuing the ability to be empty and without. In the world, some things seem to diminish yet actually bring gain, while others seem to bring gain yet actually bring loss. The principles of loss and gain are not fixed—like the moon, when full it wanes, this is gain turned to loss. When it wanes, it must wax again, this is loss turned to gain. What man teaches, I also teach.*\n\nThe overbearing and forceful shall not meet a proper end—I shall take this as my teaching father.\n\nMaster He says: In *The Golden Back Inscription* it is written: *\"The overbearing and forceful shall not meet a proper end.\"* It further states that those who delight in victory shall inevitably encounter their match, thus showing that the ancients all took this as a teaching, and I too do not seek to differ—I take this as my teaching as well. Moreover, the one who serves as the teaching father is because it is simple and easy to grasp.\n\nThe teaching father is the mother of the Dao—nothing else. Heaven, Earth, and all things arise from the One Dao, taking the void as their essence.\n\n○ Master Li says: Whatever teachings man offers are nothing but the pursuit of goodness—I too teach in this way.\n\n○ Master Wu says: This speaks of the principle of using softness. *Liang* (梁) also means \"strong.\" To block water with wood, to bear beams with wood—both are called *liang*, taking from their strength. \"Not meeting a proper end\" means not meeting a good death, as in Zilu’s case, who walked resolutely until Confucius said he would not meet a proper end, and indeed he later died in the disaster of Kong Yue.\n\nThe \"teaching father\" is like the root of teaching—father refers to that which is supreme and unexcelled above all else.\n\nMan’s teachings instruct in the use of softness—I too teach this. Those who are overbearing and forceful, unable to embrace softness, shall inevitably fail to preserve themselves. The benefit of overcoming others with forcefulness brings the loss of not meeting a proper end—this is what is meant by \"gain turned to loss,\" and it is the foremost principle for teaching others. Hence, it is called the teaching father.\n\n○ Master Ni says: Laozi often likens the Dao to a mother, yet here it is called father. The mother governs nurturing, while the father governs teaching. For one who takes the role of teacher, it is fitting to be revered and stern as a father.\n\n**Chapter 43**\nThe softest thing under Heaven\nRanges freely over the hardest thing under Heaven.\n\n「There is nothing that enters the *Wujian* [無間, \"utterly seamless\" or \"void of gaps\"], and thus I know that *Wuwei* [無為, \"non-action\"] brings benefit. Master Lin says: The firm may be easily broken, while the soft endures forever. To act with the utmost softness between the firmest things is like water’s ability to penetrate stone. *Wujian* refers to the absence of seams or fissures. *Wuwei* [無有, \"void of form\"] is the same as *Wuwei* [無形, \"formlessness\"]. As in the human body, the *Rongwei* [榮衛, \"nourishing and defensive *qi*\"] circulate between the seams, and the *qi* and meridians flow through them. Even in the gaps where there is no fissure, sunlight and moonlight enter—these are all cases of *wuwei* [無有, \"void of form\"] entering *wujian* [無間, \"seamlessness\"].\n\n○ Master He says: Under Heaven, nothing is softer than *qi* [氣], and *qi* is nothing softer than the Dao/Way. The Dao/Way’s softness is its ability to envelop Heaven and Earth, to penetrate all things. Laozi once spoke thus to Guan Yin, explaining that the Dao/Way and *qi* are soft in this manner. The *qi* of Heaven and Earth, though as firm as metal and stone, penetrates everywhere. The Dao/Way is the same: its origin is subtle yet simple, its culmination vast yet firm and enduring. Thus, the utmost softness is not weakness, and the utmost firmness is not strength—like the cascading waters of Mount Tai eroding stone, or the hemp rope severing the *danji* [單極, \"single pillar\"]. This is of the same kind.\n\nTo \"drive and range\" [驰骋] is the *Zhuangzi*’s meaning of \"riding Heaven and Earth, ranging over all things.\" One who can wield the Dao/Way to govern existence moves from the utmost firmness to the original softness, from the original softness to the primordial *Yuan* [元, \"origin\"]. As in the *Liezi*: \"The body of *Liezi* is in harmony with the heart, the heart with *qi*, *qi* with spirit, and spirit with the void.\" By this, one sees that the Dao/Way is utterly seamless in its operation, and its subtlety is profound. Then one knows the benefit of *wuwei* [無為, \"non-action\"], where non-action is the return to the Dao/Way, stillness is the dissipation of *qi*, and the root of life is preserved by entering the *wujian* [無間, \"void of gaps\"]. One may attain this through silent contemplation.\n\n○ Master Lü says: Under Heaven, nothing surpasses water, yet even water is not entirely without form. Some things seem formless but enter into form—this is *qi*. *Qi* is inherently soft, and even though *qi* is soft, when nourished to its utmost firmness and strength, no one can resist it. To govern firmness with firmness, if it does not break, it will shatter. To govern firmness with softness, neither the softness is worn away nor the firmness is harmed. The Dao/Way’s ultimate softness is the same as *qi*. To range over the utmost firmness means that *qi* can penetrate joints and open passages—thus, the softest thing under Heaven ranges over the hardest thing under Heaven. When formless enters form, the formless is never exhausted, and the formed never sated. Only the *qi* of the Great *Fan* [梵, \"pervading, transcendent\"] is without form or substance, and thus it can envelop Heaven and Earth without boundary, and cling to the finest hairs without interiority. The sage embodies this, and his virtue/power is thus realized.\n\nWhen one sees the Dao/Way clearly, nothing is impassable—this is how one governs all under Heaven through divine transformation, likening the ultimate person to the *Qi Mu* [氣母, \"matrix of *qi*\"], refining and drawing forth the *Taihe* [太和, \"Grand Harmony\"]. Divine clarity resides within him, unrestricted in its coming and going, profound beyond measure. Thus, it is said: \"There is nothing that enters the *wujian* [無間, 'void of gaps'].\" The sage of *wuwei* [無為, \"non-action\"] dwells before the *Xiangdi* [象帝, \"Archetypal Sage\"] and in the midst of the *Taiji* [太极, \"Grand Polarity\"]. The Dao/Way’s wondrous application truly lies here. The sage follows it, standing without instruction, sitting without debate, moving with emptiness and returning with substance—nothing is impossible. How could this be a minor supplement?\n\nThe ultimate person practices *wuwei* [無為, \"non-action\"] and does nothing, yet his body is not weary. He forgets self and others, yet his essence is not diminished. He does not desire the Dao/Way, yet the Dao/Way naturally returns to him. Thus, it is said: \"I know that *wuwei* [無為, 'non-action'] brings benefit.\"\n\nThe teaching of *wuwei* [無為, \"non-action\"]—that is, the benefit of non-action—is rare under Heaven. Master Lin says: The first two sentences are all analogies. By this, one knows that *wuwei* [無為, \"non-action\"] is not the same as *wuwei* [無不為, \"doing nothing\"]. Non-action as teaching, and spontaneous action without effort—these are all the wondrous applications of the Dao/Way, and the people of the world cannot comprehend them. Thus, it is said: \"The world rarely attains this.\"\n\nBenefit [有益] means having practical efficacy. ○ Master He says: What is meant by \"non-action as teaching\"? Like Heaven and Earth possessing great beauty yet not speaking, the four seasons having clear laws yet not debating, and all things having established principles yet not explaining—when sincerity is felt, what need is there for words? What is meant by \"the benefit of non-action\"? Like using a boat to travel on water, or a sled to traverse mountains, or making fields from high ground and ponds from low ground—the transformations of simplicity, what need is there for action? This is all due to focusing *qi* to achieve utmost softness, and reaching the essence of non-action. The Dao/Way thus operates and transforms.\n\nThus, the world rarely attains this. Teaching without words, gaining without seeking—one who preserves sincerity and embraces the Dao/Way will have the world follow naturally. Who else could possibly aspire to this?\n\n**Chapter 44**\nWhich is closer to me: name or body?\nWhich is more abundant: body or wealth?\nWhich is more harmful: gain or loss?\nMaster Lin says: Name and wealth are external things, of no benefit to my body. Thus, even if one gains or loses them, what harm could they truly cause? Yet those who do not know the Dao/Way often trouble themselves over these matters.\n\n○ Master He says: *Zhuangzi*’s Bo Yi died for his name beneath the slopes of Shouyang, while the robber Zhi died for profit atop the mounds of Dongling. Though their deaths differed, both perished in vain, harming their true nature. The zealous martyr for name, the greedy one for profit—both sacrifice their bodies, and though they die without regret, they never realize that their bodies are heavier than all under Heaven, let alone that dying for name or profit could be a burden. One who knows the Dao/Way regards even the body as not truly his own—how much more so for beautiful names and beautiful profits, which are external things!\n\nThe unknowing try to compare name with their life’s fate, saying that name is like a flower, while the body inherently has name. If the name is high and the body is endangered, then is the name not distant from the body? They compare wealth with their life’s fate, saying that wealth is like a resource for the body. Yet even if wealth is abundant and the body is harmed, is not wealth then lesser than the body?\n\nThus, it is said:\n*\"Sheng wo ming zhe sha wo shen\"* [生我名者殺我身, \"Those who give me life through name kill my body\"],\n*\"Yi wo huo zhe sun wo shen\"* [益我货者损我神, \"Those who enrich me with wealth harm my spirit\"].\n\nAt the beginning, when there is neither gain nor loss, it is like water before waves. But when loss comes after what has already been lost, harm arises naturally—who could compare this to the peace of original non-existence?\n\nWho could escape harm after what has already been lost?\n\n○ **Master Lü** says: To prioritize the body over name and value the body above wealth is still not to forget oneself. But he who forgets himself does not even possess the body—how much less does he possess name and wealth!\n\nIndeed, name without substance is hollow, and substance without name is true. The noble man toils night and day, pondering good and ill, yet even his form grows thin. The wealthy man exhausts his body with labor, competing for fame and hoarding wealth, yet cannot enjoy it all—his form becomes but an alien vessel.\n\nYet the sage values the body as the foundation for all under Heaven, not through forgetting himself, but by making all under Heaven know that name is insufficient for intimacy and wealth is insufficient for abundance. Thus, **Bò Yì** starved to death beneath Chief Yang’s slope, a sacrifice to name. **Zhóu Jī** died upon the Eastern Ridge, a sacrifice to profit.\n\nBetween name and wealth, which is more abundant, which is less? To sacrifice the body for name, the world will call him a **gentleman**; to sacrifice the body for profit, the world will call him a **villain**. Gain brings joy, loss brings sorrow; covetousness of gain forgets loss, and greed for profit forgets righteousness. This is like using **Duke Sui’s pearl** to shoot a thousand-foot-high sparrow—though one may strike the bird, the pearl is already lost. Truly, what is lost is heavy, what is gained is light—how lamentable!\n\nThe disease lies in desiring what one cannot obtain; when one has already gained but fears losing it, the disease is even worse than the loss itself. Only when one attains **equanimity between having and lacking**, and accepts both gain and loss with balance, does true peace begin.\n\nTherefore, **excessive love leads to great expenditure**, and **hoarding wealth brings heavy loss**. ○ **Master Lín** says: Love clings to something, so one must inevitably exhaust mind and strength in seeking it—love grows greater, so does the exhaustion. This speaks of name. Greed leads to hoarding, and when loss comes one day, it will be great. If one hoards nothing, one loses nothing; if one hoards little, one loses little. Only through much hoarding does one invite much loss—these two lines illuminate the next three.\n\n○ **Master Hé** says: To crave fine names is called **excessive love**; name is but a guest to substance, so the greater the name, the greater the mental strain. To dwell on rare wealth is called **hoarding**; profit is the catalyst for chaos, so the thicker the wealth, the greater the loss of what is truly valuable.\n\n○ **Master Wú** says: Love refers to love of name; great refers to the body. Comparing name to the body, the body is greater than name. Those who admire name love it excessively, yet love of the body is not as fervent as love of name—this will inevitably drain the mind and shorten life. Thus, it is said: **great expenditure**. Hoarding refers to hoarding wealth; great also refers to the body. Comparing wealth to the body, the body is more substantial than wealth. Those who crave wealth hoard it excessively, yet those who value the body do not weigh it as heavily as those who value wealth—this will inevitably lead to the loss of life and premature death. Thus, it is said: **heavy loss**.\n\nTo know sufficiency is to avoid disgrace; to know restraint is to avoid peril—thus one may endure long.\n\n○ **Master Lín** says: Only he who knows sufficiency does not fall into self-disgrace; only he who knows restraint does not court danger—thus he may endure long. These three lines are timeless wisdom, never exhausted by ages past or future.\n\n○ **Master Hé** says: To know sufficiency means recognizing the proper measure in what one has already gained in name and profit, so that the body may early withdraw from strife—what disgrace could there be? To know restraint means refusing even a hair’s breadth of what one ought not to possess in name and profit, so that the body may remain hidden—what peril could there be? Only then may one endure long.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says: A contented heart seeks nothing beyond itself, so there is no disgrace. A still mind extinguishes all entanglements, so there is no peril—thus one may endure long, may endure forever.\n\n○ **Master Wú** says: To know the fixed measure within oneself, then one is sufficient without greed, and does not fall into disgrace through reckless actions or loss of integrity. To know that external things bring no true benefit, then one restrains without seeking, and does not court peril through depletion of life or premature death—thus one may endure long.\n\n○ **Master Lǐ** says: Name and wealth, gain and loss—all are matters of **artifice**. They never endure long. Only to know sufficiency and restraint may one endure long.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five**\nGreat fulfillment seems like a lack, yet its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat abundance seems like emptiness, yet its use is endless.\nGreat rectitude seems like bending, great skill seems like clumsiness, great eloquence seems like stammering.\n\n○ **Master Lín** says: Fulfillment brings lack; great fulfillment is always as if lacking, so its use is inexhaustible. Abundance brings emptiness; great abundance is always as if empty, so its use is endless. The previous chapter states: \"Hollow brings abundance, worn-out brings renewal\"—this is the same meaning. Great rectitude is always as if bent; what seems crooked is straight, what seems curved is whole. Great skill is always as if clumsy; it does not boast of itself. Great eloquence is always as if stammering; it does not force speech.\n\n○ **Master Lǐ** says: The previous chapter speaks of knowing sufficiency to avoid disgrace, so it follows with *great fulfillment seems like a lack*—virtue in excess appears as deficiency, life in excess appears as poverty. Great fulfillment as lack, great abundance as emptiness, even to the point of seeming bent, clumsy, or stammering—all are virtue in excess appearing as deficiency. Its use is without end.\n\n○ **Master Wú** says: To fulfill as fulfillment, to be abundant as abundance, to be straight as straight, to be skillful as skill, to be eloquent as eloquence—this is small. But to lack and not be fulfillment, to be empty and not be abundance, to bend and not be straight, to be clumsy and not be skillful, to stammer and not be eloquence—this is the greatness of fulfillment, abundance, straightness, skill, and eloquence.\n\nAgitation conquers cold, stillness conquers heat—**clearing and tranquility** are the true norm for all under Heaven.\n\n○ **Master Lín** says: Agitation’s peak is cold, stillness’s peak is heat—agitation and stillness are but the two forces of **yin and yang**. When **qi** stagnates in one extreme, it becomes illness; only **Dao’s** clearing and tranquility, neither having nor lacking, neither moving nor still, is the true norm for all under Heaven.\n\n○ **Master Hé** says: The Dao’s norm is **clearing and tranquility**, and it is only through **clearing and tranquility** that greatness is attained. Agitation conquers cold, yet when **yang** reaches its extreme, **yin** arises; stillness conquers heat, yet when **yin** reaches its extreme, **yang** arises. All extremes arise from one-sided dominance. But when Heaven is clear and Earth is tranquil, this is the supreme norm for all under Heaven—neither dominance nor extremity—yet it is vast and enduring. The Classic says: *\"If one can always maintain **clearing and tranquility**, all under Heaven will naturally return to this.\"*\n\n**Laozi’s *Zhāngyì* (Collected Commentaries), Volume 6 complete.**\n**Laozi’s *Zhāngyì*, Volume 7.**\n**Jūjiāng Wēi Dàyǒu’s *Collection*, Chapter 46.**\n\n*\"When the Dao prevails in the world, even swift horses are turned aside to spread manure.\nWhen the Dao does not prevail, warhorses are bred in the suburbs.\"*\n\n**Master Lǚ** says: In times of prosperity, the common people flourish, the seas are at peace, weapons are laid aside, and the people diligently till the land, competing in agriculture and sericulture. Their manure enriches the fields—though fine horses exist, they serve no martial purpose. How could this not be called the Dao?\n\nIn times of decline, all affairs falter, calamities arise, and the strong oppress the weak. Boundaries are contested, and the seeds of war take root. Warhorses gallop across battlefields, blocking the flow of **yin and yang** and stunting the growth of all things. How could this not be called the absence of the Dao?\n\nFor the body is but a microcosm of the world. The *Nánhuá Jīng* (Zhuangzi) speaks of wild horses and dust—thus, horses symbolize **qi**.\n\n**Yang Zi** says: **Qi** is like a horse that carries one toward good or evil. Indeed, **qi** is the Dao, and the Dao is **qi**. From the One **qi**, all things arise; where **qi** lingers, things grow soft and weak, and where it departs, things harden and die.\n\n*\"However\"*—the word *\"however\"* (却) means to reverse, *\"walk\"* (走) means to circulate. Circulating refined **qi** upward against the flow nourishes the brain’s blood and fertilizes the roots, thus nourishing the body. Hence: *\"When the Dao prevails in the world, even swift horses are turned aside to spread manure.\"*\n\nWhen the Dao does not prevail, one abandons roots for external pursuits, the mind agitates, and breath races upward—through the upper orifices, it disperses in great waves; from below, the **jing** (essence) leaks away in a steady drip. Daily, the heart battles, and the six evils (of excess) arise at the borders.\n\n○ **Master Hé** says: When a ruler of the Dao governs the world, he does not use military might to dominate others but instead prioritizes agriculture and grain. Thus, even swift horses are turned aside to fertilize the fields, never neglecting the inner for the outer.\n\nThe Classic says: *\"Remove the filth from one’s ancestral home, and all will be restored.\"* To spread manure is to mend what has decayed.\n\nIn a world without the Dao, warhorses are bred in the suburbs—\n*Stallions prance in the boundless wilds.*\n\nThe suburbs originally refer to lands where horses are raised; if such lands obstruct farming, it is a warning.\n\n○ According to **Master Wú Chéng’s** annotated edition, the original text reads: *\"When the Dao prevails in the world, even swift horses are turned aside to spread manure [with carts].\"* In an age of the Dao, there is no mutual invasion, so fine horses are not harnessed to war chariots but instead pulled lowly manure carts to fertilize the fields. Other commentaries omit the character *\"cart\"* (车), but **Huì’ān’s** *Júzǐ Yúlù* (Zhu Xi’s Dialogues) includes it. **Zhang Heng’s** *Dōngjīng Fù* (Eastern Capital Eulogy) states: *\"Swift horses are turned aside to pull manure carts,\"* using Laozi’s full line. **Master Wú’s** edition is well-reasoned—scholars must not overlook it.\n\nNo greater crime exists than desiring what one should not,\nNo greater fault than grasping what one desires,\nNo greater calamity than failing to know sufficiency—\nThus, the sufficiency of *\"knowing sufficiency\"* is eternal sufficiency.\n\n**Master Lín** says: Wars all begin from the seed of desire. Once desire takes root, when will it ever be enough? Only by attending to what is essential does one avoid crime, calamity, and fault.\n\nOnly those who regard insufficiency as sufficiency remain truly sufficient. This further illuminates the previous chapter’s meaning: *\"Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace.\"*\n\n○ **Master Wú** says: *\"Crime\"* refers to transgressions, *\"fault\"* to misfortune, and *\"calamity\"* to disaster—yet calamity is graver than fault. To covet the Rampart Pass and still long for Shù is the failure to know sufficiency.\n\n○ **Master Lǐ** says: *\"Crime,\" \"fault,\"* and *\"calamity\"* all stem from desire. Hence the conclusion: *\"Knowing sufficiency, one is always sufficient.\"* For the contented poor find joy in poverty.\n\n**Chapter 47.**\n*\"Without stepping outside, one knows all under Heaven.\"*\n\n**Chapter 48.**\n\n*\"Without peering through the window, one perceives the Dao of Heaven.*\n*The farther one goes, the less one knows.*\n**Master Hé** says: Laozi spoke to Wenzi: *\"Qi and spirit arise from within; spirit and qi move with Heaven. This speaks solely of how spirit alone can foreknow.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lǐ** says: *\"Without stepping outside, one knows all under Heaven\"*—this means those who follow the Way know the inner and not the outer. Knowing the inner while ignoring the outer means knowing nothing; seeing the inner while ignoring the outer means seeing nothing. But if one only knows the outer and sees the outer while forgetting the inner, then one’s knowledge and perception are shallow and narrow.\n\n○ **Master Wú** says: The principles of all things and affairs under Heaven are already complete within oneself. Thus, even without stepping outside, one knows them all. The Dao of Heaven is the root of all principles; it is grasped through inner observation, not like external, tangible things that must be glimpsed through a window. Those who do not realize that all is already within themselves must travel far to know even a single matter. Hence, the farther one goes, the less one knows—how could one ever know all under Heaven without stepping outside?\n\n○ **Master Lín** says: Though Heaven and Earth are vast, human nature and the principles of things are fundamentally one. Even without stepping outside, one may know them. Though yin and yang transform, their patterns endure through the ages—visible even without peering through a window. If one insists on seeking them externally, how much can one truly know from where one’s feet tread? How much can one truly see with one’s own strength? The more one labors, the more one’s mind grows dim. Thus it is said: *\"The farther one goes, the less one knows.\"*\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without moving yet knows, sees without looking yet understands, does without doing yet achieves. **Master Hé** says: One does not guess at others through conjecture but knows them through the Way. One does not probe Heaven through speculation but perceives it through the Way. Others are myself; myself is Heaven. If one must wait to step outside and peer through a window, then one abandons the mind for the external. When spirit is insufficient, how can knowledge and perception suffice? What relation does this have to the Way? The *Yijing* says: *\"No thought, no action. Still and unmoving, yet responsive—thus one attains the patterns of all under Heaven.\"* Who but the most divine of all under Heaven could comprehend this? It further says: *\"Only the divine moves swiftly without haste, arrives without traveling.\"* This is the Way of not acting yet reaching, not seeing yet knowing, not doing yet achieving.\n\n○ **Master Lín** says: The Sage arrives without moving, understands without seeking, achieves without doing—such is the Way’s function. The *Yijing* says: *\"Swift without haste, arriving without traveling\"*—this is its meaning.\n\n○ **Master Wú** says: It is not that one does not travel to places, but that one arrives at them all as if present. Thus one thoroughly knows all under Heaven’s affairs. It is not that one does not observe things before understanding their principles, but that one perceives the Dao of Heaven without peering through a window. *\"To do without doing\"*—this verifies the previous two sentences. Only because one does not act yet knows all matters, does not observe yet penetrates the root, does one achieve without effort.\n\n**Chapter 48.**\n*\"The more one studies, the more one gains.\nThe more one follows the Dao, the more one diminishes.\nDiminish again and again,\nuntil one reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing remains undone.\"*\n\n**Master Hé** says: A thousand days of studying wisdom cannot compare to a single day of studying the Dao. It is not that one studies the Dao to learn, nor that the Dao teaches itself. Learning expands knowledge and perception; only through accumulation does it take form. The Dao, however, transcends knowledge and perception—it is originally complete. Learning seeks the Dao; extensive study leads to simplicity. Through diligent practice of non-action, one awakens to the true Dao. First, one gains before diminishing; then, one enters emptiness. Having diminished again and again, even emptiness is emptiness—only then does one align with the true Dao. This is the wondrous realm of non-action.\n\nLaozi spoke to Wenzi: *\"Non-action does not mean resisting what must respond or remaining unmoved when stirred. It is not rigid stagnation but flowing with principle while acting, seizing the moment to establish merit, entrusting to others while achieving results—this is non-action yet nothing remains undone.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lǐ** says: *\"Without stepping outside, one knows all under Heaven\"*—this is inner knowledge. *\"The farther one goes\"*—this is external affairs. Hence, it follows as a lesson in study. *\"The more one studies, the more one gains\"*—this refers to scholars seeking increase. *\"The more one follows the Dao, the more one diminishes\"*—this refers to those who follow the Way diminishing in all things. The *Yijing* says: *\"Mountain over water: Diminishing. The superior person restrains anger and blocks desire\"*—this is precisely it. Until there is no anger to restrain and no desire to block, until one reaches non-action, then all under Heaven will be transformed, and the world will turn toward it.\n\n○ **Master Lǚ** says: The perfected one diminishes again and again, until distinctions vanish, still and unmoving, reaching non-action. They preserve the true nature of their essence and embody the origin of the Way. They harmonize with Heaven and Earth in virtue and share in creation’s function. Then they refine the Great Primordial *qi*, extract the golden essence from the elbow’s end, seal the womb and breathe inward, reverse the winds and blend them, irrigate the primal spring—all this is non-action yet nothing remains undone.\n\n○ **Master Ní** says: *\"The more one studies, the more one gains\"*—this values breadth. *\"The more one follows the Dao, the more one diminishes\"*—this values simplicity. First, one broadens before narrowing; first, one gains before diminishing. Without gain, where would one find simplicity? To gain without diminishing turns breadth into confusion. Thus, study is the ladder to the Dao, and the Dao is the destination of study. Confucius said: *\"Much learning and knowing—this is the gain of study. To thread it all with one principle—this is the diminishing of the Dao.\"* Having diminished, one diminishes again—this is the utmost diminishing. When diminishing reaches its end, there is nothing left to do. Though there is nothing to do, in truth, nothing remains undone. This is why non-action is precious. If one stops at mere non-action, unable to do nothing yet achieve everything, then one falls into emptiness—this is not the Dao.\n\n*\"To take all under Heaven, one must do nothing.\nBut when action arises, it is insufficient to take all under Heaven.\"*\n\nHe Shi said: *\"To act without attachment, to let the mind dwell in non-doing—even if the world is vast, what room could my mind have for it? The sages of old who took all under Heaven did so through the natural Way. The yellow-roofed halls of Yao were not of his making; Shun and Yu held dominion without claiming it—all acted in accordance with their non-doing. If one acts upon the world, then one has attachment. The Classic says: 'To act is to ruin it; the world is a divine vessel that cannot be acted upon.' To act without acting, and the world is governed—this is it. This is why ancient sages did not exchange the Way for all under Heaven, yet always spoke warnings against taking the world, deeply cautioning those who did not know that they would prize the world above the Way. How could they know that non-action and non-doing are the natural Way?\"*\n\nLin Shi said: *\"To take all under Heaven, one must act without attachment. Those with attachment lose it. The Three Dynasties’ possession of the world—what room did they have for attachment? Though they spoke of wartime customs as metaphor, their words suffice as warning. Non-doing and doing are but non-attachment and attachment.\"*\n\nWu Shi said: *\"Non-doing is to have nothing to attend to—this is non-action. Those who speak of taking the world mean only non-action. When virtue is abundant, the world naturally returns to it. If one must exert will and force, engaging in deliberate action, how could one ever take the world?\"*\n\nLi Shi said: *\"If one rashly acts, the people grow disordered and difficult to govern. Hence, it is said one cannot take the world with such action.\"*\n\n**Chapter 49**\nThe sage has no fixed heart, taking the hearts of the people as his own.\n\nLü Shi said: *\"Heaven originally has no attachment to things; through things, Heaven’s heart is revealed. Thus, it is empty yet able to receive, still yet able to respond—like a mirror reflecting forms, whether fair or foul; like a valley echoing sounds, whether loud or soft. Initially, there is no other heart—what fixed heart could there be?\"*\n\nGong Qing said: *\"There is but one Way in the world, one heart in the sage. Hence, he likens it to himself. Silent and tranquil, he responds yet remains settled, neither leading nor following, blending his light with dust, harmonizing with all things—yet never differing from them. Thus it is said: the sage has no fixed heart, taking the hearts of the people as his own.\"*\n\nLi Shi said: *\"The previous chapter spoke of taking the world through non-doing, hence follows with the sage’s lack of fixed heart. By 'no fixed heart,' it means adapting to circumstances without opposing the nature of people and things. Thus, the people follow the sage’s words, actions, and transformations, and the world unites in one heart.\"*\n\nHe Shi said: *\"The sage’s heart is too vast—what fixedness could it have? His fixed heart is but the heart of the world.\"*\n\nZhenghe Annotation: *\"The sage’s heart is empty yet able to receive, still yet able to respond—like a mirror reflecting forms, whether fair or foul; like a valley echoing sounds, whether loud or soft. What fixedness could there be? To the virtuous, I am virtuous; to the unvirtuous, I am also virtuous—virtue is virtue. To the trustworthy, I trust them; to the untrustworthy, I also trust them—virtue is trust.\"*\n\nLü Shi said: *\"Good and evil contradict each other; truth and deceit mock each other. Good and evil, truth and deceit—these are the common distinctions of the world. Thus, those who love virtue, the sage does not defy their nature but aids them with supreme virtue, ensuring they fulfill their goodness. If there are those who are unvirtuous, he also treats them with virtue. Their virtue or lack thereof lies with them, yet my way of treating them with virtue never wavers. All conduct is without exception virtuous, and the world cannot but submit to its transformation—how profound the virtue is! Those who sincerely love trust, the sage does not quench their resolve but aids them with great trust, ensuring they fulfill their sincerity. If there are those with insincerity, he also treats them with trust, yet my way of trusting them never changes. All emotions are without exception trustworthy, and the people firmly and surely trust—virtue reaches its peak. The perfect person transcends praise and blame, forgetting truth and falsehood. The beautiful he treats as virtuous; the ugly, he also treats as virtuous—constantly saving things without abandoning any. The trustworthy he trusts; the untrustworthy, he also trusts—constantly saving people without abandoning any.\"*\n\nHe Shi said: *\"Generally, to the virtuous I am virtuous; to the unvirtuous, I do not necessarily treat them as virtuous. To the trustworthy I trust them; to the untrustworthy, I do not necessarily trust them—this is the common heart, not yet the affair of virtue as virtue, trust as trust. The sage’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth: Heaven and Earth cover all without partiality, the sun and moon shine their light without fail. The sage’s heart is unified, merging self and other. Thus, he treats the unvirtuous as virtuous, the untrustworthy as trustworthy. Though good and evil contradict, truth and deceit mock, I treat them all with the natural Way. The Classic says: 'Refine the well-ordered, also refine the unordered; advance the good, to lead the ungood—what is good, what is ungood?' The saying goes: 'Do not counterfeit, do not presume upon the untrustworthy—what is trust, what is deceit?' 'Sincerity shines clearly; observe below and transform.' This is it. From *Zhuangzi*: 'His love is one, his non-love is one; his oneness is one, his non-oneness is one. His oneness aligns with Heaven; his non-oneness aligns with humanity—this is it.'\"*\n\nLin Shi said: *\"Virtue or lack thereof lies with them, yet I always treat them with virtue, initially holding no discriminating heart. The Master said: 'If one’s resolve is set on transformation, there is no evil.' This aligns with it. Trust or lack thereof lies with them, yet I always treat them with trust, holding no doubting heart. The Master said: 'Do not presume upon the untrustworthy'—this is the same meaning. When it says, 'I also treat them as virtuous, I also trust them,' it does not mean making the unvirtuous virtuous or the untrustworthy trustworthy. It is merely responding with a heart of non-attachment.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s presence in the world is marked by humility—he muddles his heart for all under Heaven, while the people all fix their ears and eyes upon him, and the Sage treats them all as infants.\n\n Lü Shi said: *\"The Sage embodies the Dao and harmonizes with transformation, without fixed intentions, without certainty, without rigidity, without self. He encompasses all things, muddling his heart to align with their dust, following their nature to align with their transformations. He does not initially presume to take anything upon himself; when all under Heaven share one heart, they are indistinctly unified, without distinctions of good or evil, trust or falsity, truly one without duality. He responds to them with the Dao, hence it is said: 'The Sage’s presence in the world is marked by humility—he muddles his heart for all under Heaven.'\n\n Lin Shi said: *\"'Humility' means not being self-satisfied; the Sage has no pride or self-sufficiency, so he always bears this sense of unease. 'Muddling his heart' means a heart that is undifferentiated yet without sharp edges—this muddled heart is why there are no divisions of virtue or lack thereof, trust or lack thereof. 'Fixing their ears and eyes' means people all direct their sight and hearing toward the Sage, yet the Sage treats them all as infants, hence it is said: 'He treats them all as infants.' This is the Sage’s intention of never abandoning anyone.\"*\n\nChapter Fifty.\n\n**Birth and Death, Entry and Exit**\n\nLü Shi said: *\"The Dao gives rise to one qi; qi transforms and takes form, form transforms and gives rise to life. Life is the gathering of qi—all things emerge from the Machine. Life transforms and brings death; death is the dispersal of qi—all things return to the Machine. What has form returns to the formless; what lives returns to the lifeless. Things have birth and death, but their nature knows neither gain nor loss. Birth is the beginning of creation, death the transformation of yin and yang. This is the realm where all things meet their end yet do not depart from the Machine.\n\nThose who depart from the Machine—\ntheir exit is not joyful,\ntheir return is not regretful.\nTo be born and die,\nto die and be reborn—\nwithout preference, without aversion.\nThe cultivator refines himself,\ntaking the pure yang, without substance, as the qi of life,\nand the turbid yin, congealed and dreg-filled, as the qi of death.\n\nMan draws upon the harmonious qi of the void—\nneither turbid nor pure—\nyet in life he ascends to the pure yang and descends into the turbid yin.\nIf yang is pure, he becomes an Upper Immortal;\nif he descends into the turbid dregs and ascends to the pure yang,\nif yin is pure, he becomes a Lower Ghost.\n\nIf one ingests the Six Qi,\nnourishes the Original Essence,\nabsorbs the mist and dew—\nthese are all transformations of Heaven’s breath,\nformless and without substance,\nthus able to transcend the spirit and align one’s lifespan with the two solar terms.\nThis is called dying and being reborn.\n\nBut the people of the world consume grains and relish the five flavors—\nsubstantial and dense,\nthey steal their True Qi,\nscatter their pure yang,\nand sink into the turbid dregs.\nThis is called being born and dying.\"*\n\nWu Shi said: *\"To exit is to be born; to return is to die.\nExit means emerging from the non-existent into the existent;\nreturn means dissolving from the existent back into the non-existent.\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: 'All things emerge from the Machine, return to the Machine.'\nAgain: 'Their exit is not joyful, their return is not regretful.'\nAnd: 'There is an exit, there is a return.'\nAll take exit as birth, return as death.\"*\n\nLin Shi said: *\"'Birth and death, entry and exit'—these four characters are the chapter’s guiding thread.\nTo exit is to be born, to return is to die;\nto exit is to transcend and depart,\nto return is to be lost in delusion.\nOnly those who follow the Dao can return and exit.\n\nThe followers of life—thirteen in number.\nThe followers of death—thirteen in number.\nMan’s life is also thirteen steps into the realm of death.\nWhy so?\nBecause of the excess of life’s vitality.\n\nLü Shi said: *\"Yin and yang never depart from the Great Dao,\ncreation and transformation never depart from the Five Phases.\nThe harmony of presence and absence forms Heaven and Earth.\nThey emerge from the Machine to be born,\nreturn to the Machine to die.\nFew follow the Dao; many defy it.\nThus, those who cultivate life\ndo not gaze recklessly,\ndo not listen recklessly,\ndo not speak recklessly,\ndo not walk recklessly—\nin stillness and motion, serene and self-nourishing—\nthese are the followers of life.\n\nThose who court death\nlet their eyes wander over garish colors,\ntheir ears indulge in wanton sounds,\ntheir mouths crave what is un-Dao,\ntheir feet tread forbidden paths—\nin stillness and motion, they drown themselves,\ndestroying their own vitality—\nthese are the followers of death.\n\nMoreover, the Way of life and death,\nthough divided into two,\nstill knows action without knowing rest,\nknows speech without knowing silence,\nknows thought without knowing forgetfulness,\nknows advance without knowing retreat—\nand thus exhausts itself in the realm of death.\n\nThe Way of life and death,\nwhen spoken of as thirteen,\nthree for each of the four—\nthe Way of neither life nor death\nlies in the emptiness of Oneness.\nThis is why it is not spoken of;\none must awaken to it themselves.\n\nAs for the saying of thirteen,\nthough many have expounded it before and after,\nno definitive conclusion exists.\nYet a few interpretations are somewhat acceptable.\n\nAn ancient Immortal said:\n*'Within yang, thirteen symbols manifest;\nwithin yin, six or seven seek no synthesis.'*\nThis refers to the numerical completion of water and fire.\n\nHeaven One gives rise to Water,\nEarth Six completes it;\nEarth Two gives rise to Fire,\nHeaven Seven completes it.\nSix and Seven—\nthese are the heart and kidneys,\nthe water and fire of Kan and Li,\nthe roots of humanity.\nSpirit dwells within them;\nthe heart houses the spirit,\nthe kidneys house the essence.\nIn all daily interactions of the mundane and the sage,\nspirit is never absent.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* says:\n*'One’s spirit in the body must not be lost.\nSpirit residing in the body—this is the follower of life.\nSpirit departing from the body—this is the follower of death.'\nWater and fire can both sustain life and destroy it—\nare they not the followers of life and death?\n\nWhen the red serpent stirs,\nthe spirit’s brilliance follows swiftly,\nresponding faster than grains,\nerupting from the Machine—\nis this not the realm of death?\n\nThus it is said:\nThe followers of life—thirteen in number.\nThe followers of death—thirteen in number.\nMan’s life is also thirteen steps into the realm of death.\n\n*Liezi*, pointing to a skull, said:\n*'This one overindulged in pleasure;\nthis one overindulged in nourishment.'\nWarm clothing, heated rooms,\ndelicious wine and rich grains,\ningesting minerals and stones—\nthough they nourish excessively,\nthey harm life instead.\nBetter to quiet the heart,\ndisdain flavors,\nnourish the spirit-grain—\nthough it seems to slight life,\nit can prolong it.\"*\n\nLi Shi said: *\"Water’s completion is six,\nfire’s completion is seven.\nThe gentle and weak—followers of life;\nthe strong and great—followers of death.\nThe gentle and weak can restrain anger and suppress desire;\nthe strong and great are enslaved by anger and desire.\nTo restrain anger is to subdue fire;\nto suppress desire is to elevate water.\nWhen water and fire are harmonized, life follows—\nthus it is said: the followers of life.\nTo indulge in anger is to lose clarity;\nto indulge in desire is to stir the waves of suffering.\nWhen water and fire conflict, death follows—\nthus it is said: the followers of death.\n\nMan’s life depends on water and fire;\nto step into the realm of death is to let them conflict.\nIn the Dao of the Elixir,\nwhen water and fire are harmonized,\nthe Holy Embryo congeals.\"*\n\nLin Shi said: *\"If cultivation follows the Way,\none may achieve longevity and clear vision.\nIf cultivation does not follow the Way,\none perishes with all things.\"*\n\n「The term *徒* refers to one’s kind or category. *动之死地* is not the *动* of motion and stillness, but rather the *动* of action and cessation. *之* means \"to go,\" and *死地* means \"the place of death.\" *夫何故* is an interrogative phrase asking, \"Why is this so?\"\n\n*生者* is what sustains my life;\n*生生者* is what nourishes my life’s vitality.\nIf one nourishes life excessively—\nthis is why, upon taking action, one hastens toward the place of death.\nThis embodies the meaning:\nthe external body may persist while the self is gone,\nhaving nothingness before one can attain fullness,\nemptiness before one can achieve completeness.\n\n○ **Master He said:** \"The followers of death and life each number thirteen. Various schools have differing views, but they merely stretch the numbers to fit their own interpretations. In truth, the upper limit of longevity is a hundred years, while the middle and lower limits vary, and contentment with wealth, ease, and peace are all blessings—these are the followers of life. Short-lived, untimely demise, illness, poverty, and frailty are extremes—these are the followers of death. Yet even before discussing virtue and vice, the first two categories each receive their fate from Heaven. Who can equalize them? This is not yet the crux of the matter. But if one is foolish and unworthy, clinging to life while losing reason, creating unnatural agitation to hasten one’s own demise, they not only become a follower of death but also rush toward the place of death—this calamity lies within humanity itself.\n\n*The place of death* refers to those who act in accordance with vice yet do not embrace virtue. In generalizing about the world as described earlier, three out of every ten individuals fall into these categories, not necessarily adhering to the previous figures. Yet the followers of death already number thirteen, and those who hasten toward the place of death number another thirteen—six out of ten are doomed to death. The followers of life number only three—how dire!\n\nIf one seeks to preserve life and avoid death,\nonly one in ten is a virtuous person.\n\n*The Zhuangzi* states:\n*\"A man’s life is the gathering of his qi;\nwhen gathered, it is life; when scattered, it is death.\nIf death and life are merely categories,\nwhat need have I to fear them?\"*\nThus, it is clear that the true affliction lies in the *place of death*, not in being a follower of death.\n\n○ **Master Wu said:** *之* is akin to \"to go\" or \"to hasten.\" *生生* seeks to sustain life itself, while *厚* means excessive fixation—whether through Daoist elixir practices that stray from proper alignment or through alchemical preparations that overdo the measures. Their intent is to hasten life, yet in doing so, they only hasten toward the place of death, for their obsession with life does not conform to the natural Dao.\n\nIndeed, those who excel in preserving life\nwalk on land without encountering rhinoceros or tigers,\nenter battlefields without being struck by weapons or armor.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to lodge its horn,\nthe tiger no place to set its claws,\nand weapons no place to find their mark.\nWhy is this so?\nIt is because they have no place of death—\ntheir hearts are empty, and thus harm cannot touch them.\n\n○ **Master Lin said:** \"It is said that the ancient masters of life-nourishment, though wandering in deep mountains, never encountered rhinoceros or tigers; though entering the midst of armies, they were never struck by weapons or armor. This is because they had no fixation—thus, things could not harm them. The rhinoceros could not charge, the tiger could not attack, and weapons could not wound—all because they had no fixation. *The Zhuangzi* also speaks of entering water without drowning, entering fire without burning—this is the same principle.\n\nWhy is this so?\nAgain, a question arises:\nthings cannot harm them because they embody emptiness and nothingness,\nand thus have no place of death.\n\n○ **Master Wu said:** *摄* means \"to govern\" or \"to oversee,\" as in *摄政*—to temporarily manage life as though it were a realm to be governed, without claiming it as one’s own. Dwelling in the realm of emptiness and stillness, presenting as gentle and weak, they are solid and unknowing like wood or stone, yet innocent and desireless like a babe. Even when confronted by fierce beasts or wicked men, they are untouched by harm.\n\nFor their impurities are dissolved,\ntheir spirit and *qi* serene and tranquil—\nlike wind, like shadow—\nnothing can grasp or seize them.\nThere is no substance in them that can die,\nand even if harm comes their way,\nhow could it find purchase to wound them?\n\n○ **Master Li said:** \"Those without the place of death\nare those who forget life and death.\"\n\n○ **Master He said:** \"Rhinoceros and tigers are spoken of as the most formidable of beasts—rhinoceros, the wild ox, weighing a thousand *jin*, with a single horn.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One:**\n*The Dao* gives birth to life;\n*virtue/power* nourishes it;\nthings take their form from it;\ncircumstances bring it to fruition.\"\n\nThus, all things reverence the *Dao* and hold *virtue/power* dear.\n\nThe *Dao*'s eminence and *virtue/power*'s nobility—\nnone command them yet they ever abide naturally.\n\n**Master He said:** \"The heavens cover with the *Dao* and all things are born;\neach thing receives its *qi* from the heavens.\nThe earth bears with things and all things are nourished;\neach thing receives its substance from the earth.\nThus, all things born possess their own forms and colors,\nnot awaiting external carving or refinement.\nYin and Yang intermingle, the four seasons succeed one another,\nmutually giving life and taking it—\ntheir *circumstances* thus come to fruition.\nWho could resist them?\n\nFor form has its time of decline,\nand *circumstances* have their time of collapse,\nyet *Dao* and *virtue/power* endure in heaven and earth,\nhigh and profound, eternal and unceasing,\nunbroken and undying.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"Qián* governs with authority, *Kūn* conceals with capacity—\nthus the *Dao* is supreme in eminence, with none to rival it.\n*Virtue/power* is supreme in nobility, its height unmatched.\nThough things differ in myriad ways,\nnone can compare to this.*\n\n*Dao* and *virtue/power* transcend *circumstances* above,\nyet move within form and *qi* below—\nnothing lacks them, no time does without,\nfilling heaven and earth as the Eastern Cloth,\nits fundamental essence universally acknowledged.\nNot from deliberate decree,\nnor from human contrivance—\nits birth and nourishment are ever natural.\nWhat is worthy of reverence and nobility\nis also ever natural.\n\nYet the order of birth, nourishment, and formation—\nthough *Dao* and *virtue/power* and things and *circumstances* may differ,\nthey are ultimately spoken of as one *Dao*.\n\n**Master Lin said:** \"The *Dao* is natural and without;\nall things conform to the void and thus are born,\nhence it is said: *'The Dao gives birth to them.'*\n*Virtue/power* then has its account,\nhence it is said: *'Virtue/power nourishes them.'*\nNourish implies existence.\nThings then have form,\nhence it is said: *'Things take their form from it.'*\n*Circumstances* imply correspondence,\nhence it is said: *'Circumstances bring it to fruition.'*\nYin and Yang’s mutual pairing,\nthe four seasons’ mutual succession—\nthese are all *circumstances*.\n'None command them yet they ever abide naturally'\nis akin to saying: 'None make it so yet it is so.'\nIf there were no agency behind them,\nthey would be ever naturally constant.\nReverence and nobility speak of their transcendence above all things.\n\n**Master Li said:** \"The *Dao* originally has no form,\nyet through its birth and nurturing of heaven and earth, form becomes visible.\nThe *Dao* originally has no name,\nyet through its sustenance of all things, names begin to arise.\nAll things with form receive their mandate from heaven,\ntheir shapes from earth,\ntheir *qi* balanced and harmonized—\nall are under the *Dao*'s influence,\nhence all things reverence the *Dao* and hold *virtue/power* dear.\nThus, the *Dao* gives birth, nourishes, lengthens, and matures them,\ncovers and sustains them.\nIt births without possession,\nacts without reliance,\nlengthens without domination—\nthis is called the Mysterious *Virtue/power*.\n\n**Master He said:** The *Zhuangzi* says: \"The *Dao* is the common origin of all things;\nthose who lose it die, those who gain it live,\nhence the *Dao* gives birth and nourishes them.\nAs the Way of Spring, it lengthens and nurtures them—\nas the Way of Summer.\nIt brings to fruition and matures them—\nas the Way of Autumn.\nIt sustains and covers them—\nas the Way of Winter.\nThe *Gēngsāng Zǐ* says: 'Spring *qi* unfurls and all grasses are born,\njust as Autumn arrives and all treasures are formed—\nhow could this not be so if they are gained?\nThe Great *Dao* has already gone forth—\nthis is it.\nWhat *Dao* is this?\nThe void and natural *Dao*,\nable to birth all things at their beginning,\nyet also to shepherd and conceal all things at their end.\nHeaven and Earth in motion and stillness—\nwithout convergence and dispersion, they cannot arise or fade.\nThe *Gēngsāng Zǐ* thus reveals the Great *Dao* in Spring’s birth and Autumn’s fruition,\nwhile Laozi unifies the arising and the covering in one *Dao*.\nThe *Yijing* says: 'It manifests in benevolence,\nit conceals in utility—\nthus is it.'\n\nHeaven and Earth act without intent—\nthough they give birth, they do no harm,\nyet claim no ownership;\nthough they act without refusal,\nthey do not boast of their deeds;\nthough they nurture without end,\nthey do not lord over others.\nThe seasons’ course—\nwhen their work is done, they withdraw.\nThe Great Emptiness, profound and silent,\nwho could force a name upon it?\n\nThe Mysterious *Virtue/power*—\nthis is the Heavenly *Virtue/power*, the *Dao*.\n\n**Master Lin said:** 'Lengthening and nurturing,\nbringing to fruition and maturing,\nsustaining and covering—\nall speak of what comes after birth and existence.\nYet within heaven and earth,\nendless birth and nurturing arise—\nall from the power of transformation.\nYet transformation neither possesses nor claims ownership,\nnor does it rely to boast of deeds,\nthough it lengthens all without a master’s intent—\nthis is why it is called the Mysterious and Marvelous *Virtue/power*.\nThe Mysterious *Virtue/power* is transformation itself.'\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two:**\nThe world has a beginning,\nwhich serves as the world’s mother.\nHaving known its mother,\none knows its children;\nhaving known its children,\none returns to guard its mother—\nthus, no peril befalls the body.\n\n**Master Lǚ said:** The *Liézǐ* speaks of *Tàiyì* (the Supreme Simplicity),\n*Tàichū* (the Supreme Primordial),\n*Tàishǐ* (the Supreme Beginning),\nand *Tàisù* (the Supreme Purity).\n*Tàiyì* is before *qi* appears,\n*Tàichū* is the beginning of *qi*.\nNow, the *Dao* originally had no beginning—\nit envelops heaven and earth externally,\nfills the cosmos internally,\nformless and nameless,\nthe source from which all things draw their origin.\nWhen it takes on names,\nthen things gain their means to be born.\nThere is a primal mixture formed,\nbefore heaven and earth were born—\nthus it is the world’s beginning.\nIt births and nurtures heaven and earth,\nlengthens and sustains all things—\nthus it is the world’s mother,\nand all things are thus formed.\n\nTake, for instance, the world within a single body:\nits beginning stems from the Three Primordials nurturing *virtue/power*,\nthe Nine *qi* forming its shape.\nWithout the Three Primordials’ nurturing,\nwithout the Nine *qi*’s guidance,\nit could not be born—\nthus it is the beginning-mother of a single body.\nHence it is said: *'The world has a beginning,\nwhich serves as the world’s mother.'*\n\nHaving obtained its *qi*,\nit becomes the mother of all limbs.\nOne must know its children—\nthe children are the spirit.\nHaving made the spirit the Original Spirit,\nand the *qi* the Original *Qi*—\nwhen the mother remains, the children endure;\nwhen the mother departs, the children weep—\nfor the *qi* can birth the spirit,\nwhile the spirit can subdue the *qi*.\n\nThe *Danjing* calls them *jūn-chén* (Lord-Subject),\nor also *mǔ-zǐ* (Mother-Child).\nThe ancient True Persons say:\n'When child and mother first meet, their affection springs like spring;\nwhen Lord and Subject unite, their joy clusters like happiness.'\n\nWithin the form, Mother and Child dwell,\n*Qi* guards the spirit, the spirit guards *Qi*;\nin mutual affection they cling and blend,\nunited as one, forming the embryonic sage—\nthus harmonized with Heaven, their essence complete.\n\nHence it is said:\nHaving obtained its Mother,\nthen know its Child,\nHaving known its Child,\nthen guard its Mother—\nthus the body perishes not.\n\n○ Lin Shi says:\n*The world has a beginning,*\n*which serves as the Mother*—\nthis is the Mother of all named things.\nThe Mother is *Zàohuà* (Creation),\nthe Child is all things.\nKnowing Creation while also knowing all things,\nknowing all things yet still knowing Creation—\nfor without *Wu* (Non-Being) there could be no *Yǒu* (Being),\nwhile *Yǒu* arises from *Wu*.\nThose who know *Yǒu* must not fail to know *Wu*—\nto seek *Wu* with desire is to glimpse its mystery,\nto seek *Yǒu* with desire is to grasp its limits.\nThis too is the meaning.\n*\"Thus the body perishes not\"*—\nmeaning that so long as one abides thus,\nthere shall be no peril throughout life.\n\n○ Dong Si Jing says:\nHumans receive *Qi* to be born,\n*Qi* as the Mother;\nthe spirit resides within *Qi*,\nthus one must have the Child guard the Mother,\nso that *Qi* may focus and the spirit be at ease.\n\n○ He Shi says:\nThe Classic states:\n*\"Non-Being was the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nBeing was the Mother of all things\"*—\nthis is the meaning of the passage’s Beginning and Mother.\nThe *Taìshǐ* (Supreme Beginning) is merely *Wu* and *Yǒu*.\nFrom *Wu* to *Yǒu* is the Mother,\nas in *\"The Dao gives birth to One\"* is the way.\nFrom *Yǒu* to *Yǒu* is the Child,\nas in *\"One generates Two, Two generates Three,\nThree generates all things\"* is the truth.\n\nTo **塞其兑** (*sè qí yuè*),\nto **闭其门** (*bì qí mén*),\nthus the body labors not its whole life.\nTo open **兑** (*yuè*),\nto advance its affairs,\nthus the body cannot be saved its whole life.\n\n○ Lü Shi says:\n*Qián* (Heaven) and *Kūn* (Earth) are the gates of the *Yì* (Changes),\nopening and closing with regularity—\nfrom them all hexagrams emerge.\nThe mechanism of birth and transformation\nfollows virtue’s measure without deviation.\n*Yuè* (兑) means delight,\nit means dispersion—\nthe pathways by which the ears and eyes\nare drawn to colors and dust.\nIf one **塞** (*sè*) the love and delight\nof sight and hearing,\nthen the gates of calamity and fortune are shut—\nnaturally, the body knows no labor.\n\nShould one open the gates of love and delight\nyet fail to **塞** (*sè*) them,\nthen the cravings of desire shall grow—\nthroughout life, peril and ruin shall be unavoidable.\n\nBy this analogy of oneself:\n*Yuè* (兑) is the mouth,\nthe gate is the eyes—\nconstantly sealing the mouth,\nthen the Five *Qi*’s within solidify,\nand the Original Essence does not dry.\nConstantly dimming the eyes,\nthen the inner realm does not emerge,\nand the outer realm does not intrude—\nin stillness, supreme equanimity,\nunited with the Dao.\n\nThe *Shēntóng Qìè* (Parametric Agreement) says:\nEars and eyes are one’s treasures,\nkeep them sealed, do not let them shine.\nDo not speak with the *Yuè* (兑) mouth,\nnor seek the subtle with the coarse.\nThis is what is meant by:\n**塞其兑, 闭其门**—\nthus the body labors not its whole life.\n\nShould one open the gates of delight\nyet fail to **塞** (*sè*) them,\nadvance the affairs of desire\nyet fail to **闭** (*bì*) them,\nthen external things shall entice,\nand inner passions shall stir—\n*Qi* shall dissipate, fluids shall leak,\nand the spirit shall scatter.\nIts spirit shall wither and die,\nand none shall be able to save it—\nthus it is said:\n**开其兑, 济其事**—\nthroughout life, the body cannot be saved.\n\n○ Lin Shi says:\n*Yuè* (兑) is the mouth,\nin the body there is a mouth,\nin the home there is a gate—\nall are metaphors for the place\nfrom which all things emerge.\n\n**塞其兑, 闭其门**—\nto conceal *Yǒu* within *Wu* and not reveal it.\n*\"Thus the body labors not\"*—\nmeaning success without toil.\nTo open **兑** (*yuè*)—\nto emerge and put it to use.\nTo advance its affairs—\nto use it and seek further benefit.\n*\"Thus peril and ruin shall be unavoidable.\"*\n\n○ He Shi says:\nThe gate—\nthough ancient commentaries point to the mouth,\nthis is not rigid—\nanything that has emergence and intrusion\nmay be called a gate.\nTo **闭其门** (*bì qí mén*)—\nto obscure the mind with the Great Dao,\nso that external thoughts do not enter,\nand inner thoughts do not escape.\nAs in *Zhuāngzǐ* (Chuang Tzu):\n*\"If one’s heart rejects it,\nthen Heaven’s gate shall not open.\"*\n\nIndeed, **塞兑闭门**—\nto enter *Wu* and extinguish *Yǒu*,\nfor the Child to know the Mother,\nis to return to the beginning,\nand thus throughout life,\nits application shall require no labor.\n\nShould one open **兑** (*yuè*) and advance its affairs,\nthen with every thought and movement,\none shall stray from the original,\nand ruin *Wu* while losing *Yǒu*—\nas the Mother gives birth to the Child,\nand entrusts it in myriad forms,\nthe Child grows strong while the Mother weakens,\nthe wheel turning endlessly—\nthroughout life, salvation shall be difficult.\n\n○ Li Shi says:\n**塞兑闭门**—\nthe inner realm does not emerge,\nthe outer realm does not intrude—\nthus the body labors not,\nand is governed without effort.\nTo open **兑** (*yuè*)—\nthe inner realm emerges,\nthe outer realm intrudes—\nthus the body cannot be saved,\nand the True Dao is forever lost.\n\n*\"Perceiving the small is clarity,\"*\n*\"Guarding the soft is strength.\"*\nUsing its light,\nthen returning to its clarity—\nno harm shall come to the body.\n\nThis is called **袭常** (*xí cháng*).\n\n○ Lin Shi says:\nWhat one perceives is vast,\nyet if one can gather and make it small,\nthen it is supreme clarity.\nWhat one governs is rigid,\nyet if one can retreat and guard the soft,\nthen it is supreme strength.\nThus, not self-asserting is clarity,\nnot self-aggrandizing is longevity.\n\nLight is the application of clarity,\nclarity is the essence of light—\nto use its light and return it to clarity,\nthen there shall be no blame.\nTo know its application yet not know concealment,\nis the way of inviting harm.\n**袭** (*xí*) means concealment,\n**常** (*cháng*) means unchanging—\n**袭常** (*xí cháng*) means\nto conceal its application and not exhaust it.\n\n○ He Shi says:\nAll who can be great yet cannot be small,\nstrong yet cannot be weak,\nclear yet cannot be obscure,\nthen they abandon the root for the branches—\nthe Child generates another Child,\nendlessly drifting, forgetting to return—\nwhat then of the Mother?\nThis is the way of inviting harm.\n\nThe Beginning is the Dao of constant *Wu*,\nthe Mother is the Dao of constant *Yǒu*—\nfrom *Wu* arises *Yǒu*,\nfrom *Yǒu* returns to *Wu*—\nthis is the unchanging Great Dao.\n\nIt is also said:\n*\"Using light yet returning to clarity—*\nthe sage shines without dazzling.\"\n*\"Observing deep fish is an ill omen.\"*\n\n○ Lü Shi says:\nThe reflection of water\nilluminating things is called light,\nits essence is called clarity—\nto use its light of external illumination,\nthen to withdraw and reflect inward,\nreturning and concealing it within,\nis to grasp its essence.\n\nThe spirit, when overused, is exhausted.\nTo gaze upon deep fish is an ill omen—\nthis is the harm of expending light outward while neglecting the self.\n\nIf one can contain the light and blend with the world,\nthen no harm befalls the self.\nThis is called grasping the constant light’s use\nand returning to the constant essence of clarity—\nthus it is said: *\"Cling to the constant.\"*\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three**\n*\"If I were suddenly to know,*\nwalking the Great Dao,\nI would fear only *shī*.\"*\n\n○ **Wu Shi says:**\n*\"I\"* refers generally to all people, not Laozi speaking of himself.\n*\"Jié\"* sounds like *jié*—as in *Mencius*’ *\"Jiérán yòng zhī ér chéng lù\"* (to act swiftly and complete the path).\nThe word *\"zhī\"* cuts off *shī* as in *\"The Analects’* *‘wú shī láo’* (without bestowing favors),\nand *Mencius’* *‘shīshī cóng wài lái zhī shī’* (the ostentatious bestowal of favors from without, boastful and grand).\nThe sage’s Preface: Yanzi was *\"having-yet-as-if-not-having,\"*\n*\"being-yet-as-if-empty\"*—\nwithout bestowing favors, just as Laozi’s use was.\nHe magnified what he feared—\nthis chapter speaks of those who do not know the Dao,\nwho only seek to boast,\nso that if such a person were suddenly to know,\nand wished to walk the Great Dao,\nhe would fear only *shī* and dare not act.\n\n○ **Li Shi says:**\n*\"Fear only shī\"*—those who recognize the law fear it.\n\n○ **Chái Shi says:**\nAll who walk outside the Great Dao are to be feared.\n\nThe Great Dao is most level,\nyet people prefer byways.\n\n○ **Wu Shi says:**\nByways are narrow paths,\ncontrary to the Great Dao.\nThe truly humble, withdrawing, is the Great Dao—\nits way is flat and easy to walk,\nyet the boastful and ostentatious are the byways.\nAnd people love to tread them.\n\n○ **Lü Shi says:**\nThe Great Dao is a broad, open thoroughfare,\nlevel and unobstructed—wherever one goes, it is passable.\nThough distant as thousands of miles,\none must begin with the step beneath one’s feet.\nThe sage fears overstraightness,\nhesitating before action—\ndoes he value swift arrival or seek near-term gain?\nThe world values swift arrival,\nso they take shortcuts.\nYet they stumble, confused, unaware of their destination,\nmoving backward, acting contrary—\nthe farther they stray from the Dao,\nthe less chance they have of ascending.\nThe Dao of refining and nurturing is level as a whetstone,\neasy to know and easy to walk.\nA narrow-minded scholar, stuck in a corner,\nwants quick results,\nso he wanders through side doors,\nfalls into crooked paths,\nand does not realize it.\nThus it is said:\n*The Great Dao is most level,*\n*yet people prefer byways.*\n\n○ **Hé Shi says:**\nThe Great Dao is level like a great road,\nyet if one abandons it for crooked paths,\none becomes deeply lost.\nThe court is well-ordered,\nthe fields lie fallow,\nthe granaries are empty,\nyet they adorn themselves in fine silks,\nwear sharp blades at their sides,\ngluttonously indulge in food and drink,\nhoard wealth—\nthis is called *thieving boastfulness.*\nHow can this be the Dao?\n\n○ **Wu Shi says:**\nThis speaks of boastful deeds—\nthe court is not swept clean,\nthe fields lie untended—\nthe people are forced to labor without rest,\ntheir strength drained, their stores depleted.\nThey adorn themselves with fine ornaments,\nfill their tables with rich foods,\nplunder their treasuries for wealth—\nthis is like a thief,\nproud of his spoils,\ndisplaying them outwardly.\nLike Xia’s Jie and Shang’s Xin—\nhow could one who knows the Dao do such things?\n\n○ **Lín Shi says:**\nThe Great Dao is level,\nyet people seeking it do not walk the straight path,\npreferring crooked byways.\nIt is like a ruler who orders his court splendidly—\npalaces and towers built in splendor.\nThough the court is beautiful,\nthe fields lie fallow,\nthe granaries are empty,\nyet they adorn themselves in embroidered robes,\nwear sharp blades,\noverindulge in food and drink,\nhoard wealth,\nstriving for riches and strength—\nthis is like a thief boasting of his prowess.\nHow long can this last?\nThis is a parable:\nThose who do not know the Great Dao\nyet boast of their cleverness and learning—\nthese are the ones who love byways.\n\n「How could one know the **至道** (*Zhìdào*, the Ultimate Dao/Way)?\nThat is why it is said: *\"This is not the Dao!\"*\n\n○ **Master He says:**\n*\"朝甚除\"* (*cháo shèn chú*—this is \"clearing\") refers to **修治** (*xiūzhì*, cultivation and rectification).\nThe **传** (*transmission*) states: *\"Remove the dung from the ancestral hall\"*—and again, *\"clear the path\"*—both meaning **cultivation and rectification**.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four:**\n*\"The wise builder does not uproot,\nthe wise embrace does not sever;\nsacrifice to the ancestral spirits never ceases.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lü says:**\nThose who skillfully establish a state by the Dao/Way\nstand alone above all things,\nunchanging through all ages,\nsoaring beyond all things,\nyet never reaching an end.\nIf one establishes oneself by this Dao/Way\nand governs the world by this Dao/Way,\nholding fast to its **中** (*zhōng*, central harmony),\nembodying its **常** (*cháng*, constancy),\nand anchoring it in the nameless **朴** (*pǔ*, primal simplicity),\nthen one will not be swayed by the transformations of things.\nBlessings extend to future generations,\nvirtue

vital essence) will leave the **木** (*mù*, body).\nIf **炁** (*qì*) decays,\n**精** (*jīng*, essence) will be exhausted,\nand **神明** (*shénmíng*, spirit and luminosity) will depart from the body.\nThus, the **至人** (*Zhìrén*, Perfect Sage) firmly cultivates deep roots,\nstanding alone in the vast wilderness,\nthe realm of **無何有** (*wúhéyǒu*, the boundless),\nendless and unyielding—\nimmovable, never uprooted.\n\nThose who skillfully embrace the people by the Dao/Way\nride the harmony of Heaven and Earth,\ncommand the subtleties of the **六氣** (*liùqì*, Six Qi),\nand the scholars of the world\nsettle into **一心** (*yīxīn*, singular purpose).\nThus, the people naturally gather in devotion.\n\nCultivating **一己** (*yījǐ*, oneself alone)\nis to embrace the **元** (*yuán*, primal origin) and guard the **一** (*yī*, singularity),\npreserving **神** (*shén*, spirit) and returning **精** (*jīng*, essence),\nas the winds of **回風** (*huífēng*, circulating breath) blend in the **丹田** (*dāntián*, elixir field).\nThere will be no severance, everlasting.\n\nThat is why it is said:\n*\"The wise embrace does not sever.\"*\n\nBut those who skillfully establish and embrace—\nis it not that they do more than just remain unrooted and unsevered?\nTheir virtue and grace flow through all levels,\nfilial piety and compassion extend to their descendants,\nand their lineage endures without limit—\nis this not beautiful?\n\n○ **Master He says:**\nIn the **《庄子》** (*Zhuāngzǐ*, Chuang Tzu),\nthe state of **\"建德之国\"** (*Jiàndé zhī guó*, the state built by virtue)*\nhas citizens who are simple and unsophisticated.\nThus, those who speak of **善建** (*shànjiàn*, wise establishment)\ndo not add to virtue—\nthen people will also stand with them, never uprooted.\n\nThe **经** (*classic*) says:\n*\"Embrace the One as the model for all under Heaven,\"*\nso those who speak of **善抱** (*shànbào*, wise embrace)\ndo not stray from the One—\nthen people will not abandon their hearts and be severed.\n\nIt is not merely in oneself,\nbut descendants will also rejoice and inherit it,\ntheir sacrifices stretching far into the future.\n\nThose who observe the Dao/Way\ndo not selfishly act for their descendants alone,\nbut establish teachings for the ages,\nnot speaking only to those who dwell in mountains and valleys.\nIt is said:\n*\"Great virtue must gain its rewards—rank, position, longevity—\nand the ancestral temples will enjoy them,\nthe descendants will preserve them.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lín says:**\nThe builder who does not establish virtue\nwill be uprooted,\nthe embrace that does not hold simplicity\nwill be severed.\nBut if one establishes virtue and embraces simplicity,\nthen there will be no uprooting or severing.\n\nFor households with descendants,\nsacrifice will never cease.\n\nThe Dao/Way gives birth to the **一** (*yī*, One),\nthe One generates the **二** (*èr*, Two),\nthe Two gives rise to the **三** (*sān*, Three),\nand the Three produces **萬物** (*wànwù*, all things).\nAll things are born yet never exhausted—\njust as descendants perpetuate a family.\n\nThese three sentences are parables,\nspeaking of the Dao/Way’s enduring presence\nthough it seems without limits.\n\nCultivate it in oneself—\nthen virtue is **真** (*zhēn*, true).\nCultivate it in the family—\nthen virtue has **余** (*yú*, surplus blessings).\nCultivate it in the village—\nthen virtue is **長** (*cháng*, enduring).\nCultivate it in the state—\nthen virtue is **豐** (*fēng*, abundant).\nCultivate it in the world—\nthen virtue is **普** (*pǔ*, universal).\n\n○ **Master Lü says:**\nThe Dao/Way of cultivating oneself\nin every action, every response,\nevery adaptation and transformation—\nit never fails to begin with oneself.\nRefining **氣** (*qì*) and nourishing **神** (*shén*),\nfew desires and little self-interest,\nall falsehoods exhausted—\nthen one becomes a **真人** (*Zhēnrén*, True Sage).\n\nCultivate it in the family—\nthen the father is kind, the son filial,\nthe elder brother friendly, the younger respectful,\nand the nine clans harmonious.\nAccumulating virtue with surplus,\njoy flows into future generations.\n\nCultivate it in the village—\nthen the aged are honored,\nthe ignorant are taught,\nand trust flows upward and downward.\nVirtue endures for ages.\n\nCultivate it in the state—\nthen all officials fulfill their duties,\ncalamities do not arise,\nand all treasures flourish in abundance.\nThings are filled and complete.\n\nCultivate it in the world—\nthen there is governance without teaching,\ntransformation without words,\nharmony with the Great Way,\nand even common households may be ennobled.\nVirtue spreads far and wide.\n\nIf one cultivates in family, village, state, and world—\nspeaking of virtue as surplus, enduring, abundant, and universal—\nonly in cultivating oneself\ndoes one speak of virtue as **真** (*true*).\nThis is what **《庄子》** (*Zhuāngzǐ*) means:\n*\"The Dao’s true virtue is for cultivating oneself,\nits lingering traces and scattered benefits\nare for governing the world.\"*\n\nThe root lies in oneself,\nthe branches extend outward—\nthe principle is complete.\n\n○ **Master Lín says:**\nCultivating oneself—\nvirtue is real and without falsehood.\nCultivating the family—\nvirtue accumulates with surplus blessings.\nCultivating the village—\nvirtue is what the village holds in honor.\nCultivating the state—\nvirtue extends to more people, ever greater.\nCultivating the world—\nvirtue reaches ever more widely.\n\n○ **Master Wú says:**\nThe Dao’s true virtue is for cultivating oneself,\nits lingering traces and scattered benefits\nare for governing the people.\n\nThe **家** (*jiā*, family) is beyond oneself,\nwithin the nine clans.\nThe **鄉** (*xiāng*, village) is beyond the family,\nwithin the extended neighborhood.\nThe **國** (*guó*, state) is beyond the village,\nwithin the national borders.\n\nThe **天下** (*tiānxià*, world) is beyond the state,\nwithin the four seas.\nThose who cultivate in family, village, state, and world—\nspeaking of near and far,\neach person cultivates their own virtue.\n\nYet is this something taught to all?\nNo—\n*\"I act without action,\nand the people are naturally transformed.\"*\n\n○ **Master He says:**\nWithin, in oneself and the family,\ncultivating by this Dao/Way\nbrings true virtue, accumulated strength, and lasting power—\nand even surplus remains.\n\nWithout, in village, state, and world,\ncultivating by this Dao/Way\nmakes the source deep and the flow long—\nabundant and universal.\n\nThus, observe oneself by oneself,\nobserve the family by the family,\nobserve the village by the village,\nobserve the state by the state,\nobserve the world by the world.\n\nHow do I know this of the world?\nBy this.\n\n○ **Master Lín says:**\nTake my own body,\nand you can observe others’ bodies.\nTake my own family,\nand you can observe others’ families.\nTake my own village,\nand you can observe others’ villages.\nExtend this to state and world—\nall the same.\nThe Dao’s applications are universal.»\n\n「Thus, the principle by which one observes is the Dao/Way itself—\nby observing through the Dao/Way, nothing in the world fails to align.\n\n○ **Master Lǐ says:**\nWhen applied to cultivating oneself,\nobserve the heart and examine the nature—\na settled heart ensures the body’s cultivation.\nWhen applied to governing the state,\nobserve the people and reflect upon oneself—\nif the people are transformed, then the state is well-governed.\nIf there is even one unvirtuous act in the world,\nthen it is due to one’s own governance and transformation being flawed.\nThe *Shū* [Classic of Documents] states:\n*\"If the people have faults,\nthey lie with me alone.\"*\nThis is the meaning.\n\nWhen one looks inward at all the hearts within,\nthere is even a speck of dust or attachment,\nthen it is my own innate nature that remains unclear.\n\n○ **Master Dǒng says:**\nThe method of observation is not distant—\nwhy seek it elsewhere?\nThough the divisions of things may differ,\ntheir root is singular.\nObserving by this principle,\nnothing fails to align—\nthis insight must resonate beyond mere words.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 55 of *Jìyì* [Collected Meanings] in *Zhēnchūn Dàodé* [True Purity Daoist Virtue]**\n*\"The depth of virtue/power is like that of an infant.\"*\n\n○

infant.\n\n○ **Master Hé says:**\nA true man of virtue/power\ndwells in its depth, not its shallowness—\nthus, profound virtue/power is the affair of the great.\nPreserving the essence and safeguarding the qi,\ngrasping the vital breath and harmonizing the flow—\nthe great indeed does not lose\nthe heart of the infant.\n\n○ **Master Lǐ says:**\n*\"The depth of virtue/power is like that of an infant\"*—\nit means not losing the heart of the infant.\n\n○ **Master Wú says:**\nOne who contains within himself\nthe utmost depth of virtue/power\nis like a newborn babe.\nThe previous section states:\n*\"Specializing in the vital qi to utmost softness,\nable to be like an infant,\nconstant virtue/power does not depart,\nreturning again to the infant.\"*\nMencius said:\n*\"The great

**Master Hé says:**\nProfoundly containing virtue/power,\nnot revealing it outwardly,\nharmony exists between oneself and all things—\nthus, nothing can harm him,\nand nothing can harm others.\n\n○ **Master Lǐ says:**\nThe infant’s heart is pure,\nharming nothing,\nand nothing can harm it.\n\n○ **Master Sū says:**\nThe infant’s heart is without intent,\nand figures without heart cannot oppose

or anger,\nhis qi is inherently harmonious.\nHoarse, a reversal of breath.\nThe infant’s purity and singularity are fixed—\nthus he can be so.\nYet those with the Dao/Way are also so—\nit is simply that their hearts do not move.\n\n○ **Master Hé says:**\nEssence—\nthe infant’s yin.\nAt birth, sinews and bones are unlabored,\nsoft and supple—\nyet his grasp is firm,\nwhile his yin and yang already surge.\nNot from knowing of male and female desire,\nbut from the abundance of his essence and qi.\nYet one with virtue/power\npreserves essence, qi, and spirit—\naccumulating to the point of transforming sinews, bones, and form—\napproaching this likeness.\nHoarse—\na broken voice—\nthough he cries all day,\nhis voice does not break—\nfrom the completeness of his harmonious qi.\nYet one

can they be so clear?\nIt is constancy.\n\nHuman life is bounded—\nto seek enhancement brings disaster.\nHuìzǐ said: *\"How can one have a body if one does not enhance life?\"*\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* says: *\"Words do not harm the body by their own good or evil;\nconstancy follows nature without enhancement.\"*\n\nAgain, it says: *\"Excess is enhancement.\"*\n\nThus, *\"There is no way to enhance life\"*—\nthis is the virtue/power of transcending attachment to life.\n\nLike eating in excess or indulging in superfluous actions,\nthis would be the auspiciousness of monstrousness and wickedness.\n\nThe will is the master of the *qi*,\nand the *qi* is the essence that fills the body—\nif the will stirs the *qi*,\nthen the *qi* in turn agitates the will,\nbecoming fierce and narrow

does not know the Dao/Way of constancy,\nlife’s disasters will come.\nTo gather *qi* in utmost softness,\nto embrace the principle of life—\nnow, if the will instead enslaves the *qi*,\nand the *qi* becomes bold and violent,\nhow could this be the Dao/Way?\n\nOnly those who know the Dao/Way\nfollow nature without enhancing life.\n\nWhen things grow strong, they age—\nthis is called *\"not the Dao/Way\"*.\n*\"Not the Dao/Way\"* brings early demise.\n\n○ **Master Lǚ says:**\nWhen things grow strong, they must age,\nwhen the will is violent, disaster follows—\nyet the Dao/Way uses softness and weakness to preserve virtue/power.\nIf one instead takes strength and violence as the will,\nthis is *\"not the Dao/Way\"*—\nthus, *\"not the Dao/Way\"* brings early demise.\n\nAmong all things, humans are the most refined—\nthere is life, then youth,\nyouth, then vigor,\nvigor, then aging,\naging, then death—\nthese are all those who do not know the Dao/Way\nand cannot escape the workings of *造化* [Creation-Transformation].\nIf one could seize the mechanism of Heaven and Earth,\ngrasp the subtlety of *阴阳还返* [Yin-Yang return and reversal],\nthen form could avoid birth,\nspirit could avoid

age\"*—\nthis is called *\"not the Dao/Way\"*,\nand *\"not the Dao/Way\"* brings early demise.\n\n○ **Master Wú says:**\nConstancy is like that of an infant—\nthen there is no strength,\nhow could there be aging?\nIf one does not age,\nhow could one perish?\n\n○ **Master Hé says:**\nThose who cultivate virtue/power wisely\nunderstand that discernment lies in early action—\ntheir harmony remains unshaken by external affairs,\nthus their virtue/power is complete and their spirit undiminished,\nthe reason they embody the depth of virtue/power—\nthey do not see the three shifts of youth, vigor,

to it.\nTo close its gate is to follow not the Dao/Way,\nbut what is contrary to it.\nTo dull its sharpness is to break the jagged angles of danger and height.\nTo resolve its chaos is to escape the entangling web of false views.\nTo soften its radiance is to guard wisdom as if one were foolish.\nTo blend with the dust is to forget contrivance and mingle with the common.\n\nThese six things must be done in accordance with the Dao/Way,\nthen one returns to the True and preserves the body,\ncan penetrate its Mysterious virtue/power,\nand associate with Heaven—\nthus it is called *Mysterious Unity*.\n○ **Master Lǚ says:**\nThe subtleties of creating the Dao/Way\ndo not align with the functions of yin and yang,\ntranscending the limits of form and number.\nAbove, it associates with the Originators of transformation,\nbelow, it befriends those who dwell beyond life and death,\nwithout beginning or end.\nWithout external attachments to things,\nhow could one be close to them?\nWithout seeking what is evil,\nhow could one be distant from them?\nWithout seeking in utility,\nbenefit cannot intrude upon one.\nWithout a mind toward things,\nharm cannot reach one.\nHigh rank and great wealth\ncannot stir one’s heart—\nthis is not valuing honor as nobility.\nTo be stained with shame and disgrace\ncannot alter one’s resolve—\nthis is not valuing defilement as lowliness.\nOne can preserve life and nourish form,\nthis is the Dao/Way’s *supreme height and extremity*.\nEven the world cannot attain it—\nthus it is the most noble.\n\n○ **Master Wú says:**\nIf I have attained *Mysterious Unity*,\nthen I cannot be close or distant,\nbeneficial or harmful,\nnoble or lowly to others.\nGrace, though like that of parents,\nis forgotten by people when given—\nthus I cannot be close to them.\nDistant like a passing traveler,\nyet people do not recognize or keep their distance—\nthus I cannot be distant from them.\nExternal fame, rank, wealth, and goods\ncannot truly benefit others—\nthus I cannot be beneficial to them.\nExternal life, death, calamity, and fortune\ncannot truly harm others—\nthus I cannot be harmful to them.\nPower, though like that of a ruler,\nis treated familiarly by people—\nthus I cannot be noble to them.\nInsignificant like a commoner,\nyet people cannot belittle me—\nthus I cannot be lowly to them.\nAll these six things,\nothers cannot do,\nyet I alone can—\nthus I am the most noble in the world.\n\n**Chapter 57:**\nGovern the state with uprightness,\nemploy the strange in warfare,\nacquire the world with non-action.\nHow do I know this is so?\nFrom this.\n\n○ **Master Lǚ says:**\nUprightness is the Dao/Way’s constancy,\nthe strange is its variation,\nnon-action is its truth.\nTo govern with uprightness is to fulfill the Dao/Way of ruling,\nto employ the strange in warfare is to respond to the changes of the time.\nThe ancient sages established foundations that could endure and grow great,\nnot originally intending to use warfare.\nWhen forced to act, there were campaigns and battles—\nthus, governance is uprightness,\nand warfare is the strange.\n\nThe world is a divine instrument that cannot be forced.\nThose who force it ruin it,\nthose who grasp it lose it.\nTo acquire the world is always through non-action.\nWhen there is action,\nit is insufficient to acquire the world.\nOnly those who embody the Dao/Way remain serene and non-acting,\nfollowing things naturally,\nthinking nothing, deliberating nothing—\neven if they do not acquire the world,\nthe world naturally returns to them.\n\nSpeaking of oneself,\nwhen the heart is balanced and the will steadfast,\nwhen *qi* and blood flow harmoniously,\nthen external evils do not intrude,\nand the natural divine realm is serene and settled—\nthe luminous light of Heaven shines forth,\njust as the practice of governing the state\nin accordance with the Dao/Way\nbrings peace to the borders.»\n\nIf the Six Bandits have not been eliminated and the Seven Emotions not dispelled,\nthen my body’s afflictions still linger.\nWhen dusty thoughts arise and karmic fires blaze,\nthis is the time of *no choice*—\nto wield arms without resorting to slaughter is impossible,\nto unleash killing intent without striking is impossible—\njust as the four barbarian tribes and eight frontier tribes\ninvade China in turn,\nand the Six Armies cannot restrain themselves.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"To govern with virtue/power, to use the strange in war,\nto acquire the world through non-action.\"*\nBut how can one know the intentions of Heaven and humanity?\nIt is seen through the affairs of governing the state,\nof wielding arms,\nand of acquiring the world.\n\n○ Master Wu said:\n*\"Virtue/power\"* refers to laws, statutes, and prohibitions—\nto correct what is incorrect is its meaning.\nThe disciples of Guan Zhong and Shang Yang\ngoverned with *virtue/power.*\n\nThe sovereign’s governance of the state,\nhowever, takes *cultivating oneself and harmonizing the family*\nas its foundation,\nand does not rely on laws, statutes, and prohibitions\nto establish *virtue/power.*\n\n*\"The strange\"* refers to stratagems and deceits—\nits meaning is cunning yet not upright.\nThe disciples of Sun Bin and Wu Qi\nemployed *the strange* in war.\n\nThe sovereign’s use of war,\nhowever, takes *relieving the people and punishing crimes*\nas its intent,\nand does not prize stratagems and deceits\nto achieve *the strange.*\nThus *the strange* may only be applied to war,\nbut not to governing the state,\nand *virtue/power* may only be applied to governing the state,\nbut not to acquiring the world.\n\n*Non-action* refers to the Three Sovereigns’ governance of non-doing—\nlike Heaven which does not speak,\nyet the four seasons proceed and myriad things flourish,\nwithout expecting humanity’s obedience,\nyet the world has none who do not obey.\nThus only *non-action* can acquire the world.\n\n○ Master Lin said:\n*\"To govern with virtue/power, to use the strange in war—*\nthis speaks of governance requiring administration,\nand war requiring deceit.\nBoth are acts of deliberate intent.\nBut to act without acting,\nthis can win the world’s heart.\nHence it is said:\n*‘To acquire the world through non-action.’*\nI do not know why deliberate intent is unworkable,\nwhile non-intent is effective—\nthis is the Dao/Way of it.\n\nThe world abounds in taboos and prohibitions,\nyet the people grow ever poorer.\nHumans multiply sharp tools,\nyet the state grows ever more corrupt.\n\nThe people multiply in cleverness and artifice,\nand strange things arise in abundance.\nLaws and decrees grow ever more explicit,\nyet thieves and robbers abound.\n\nMaster Lü said:\n*\"The cause of the people’s poverty and wealth,\nlongevity and early demise,\nlies in their own nature,\nwithout the ruler’s interference.\nIf the net of prohibitions is dense and strict,\nthe people grow ever more cautious and evasive,\ntheir actions falter, and their livelihoods decline,\nday by day growing poorer and more destitute.\nThus, the Sage’s engagement with the world\nis rooted in *non-doing* as the true foundation,\nwhile *doing* is but a responsive measure.\nWhether doing or not doing,\nthe Sage remains steadfast in the foundation,\nlike one amid the clamor without resentment,\nentangled in affairs yet without vexation—\nthis is the true foundation,\nwhere *non-doing* and *non-thought* are constant.*\n\nMoreover, the heart is like a sovereign,\nwhile *qi* is like the people.\nExcessive prohibitions unsettle the heart,\nand the primal *qi* is scattered and diminished—\nhence it is said:\n*\"The world abounds in taboos,\nand the people grow ever poorer.\"*\n\nSharp tools are but instruments of authority,\nthe ruler’s axes and hatchets—\nhow can subjects wield them?\nEven a single man’s tool,\nwhen shared by all,\nis like reversing the *Tà’ē* hilt\nand giving the handle to another.\nOnce authority is surrendered,\nthe state falls into chaos.\nAs for oneself,\nif the heart cannot remain pure and undivided,\nbut is instead controlled by the seven emotions and six desires,\nhow can clarity and wisdom not grow dim?\nHence it is said:\n*\"The people multiply in sharp tools,\nand the state grows ever more corrupt.\"*\n\nClever artifice is but refined craftsmanship—\nwhen rulers cannot refrain from action,\nand their minds turn to licentious excess,\nthe people fashion intricate carvings,\nornaments of gold and jade,\nstrange and wondrous things,\nto curry favor and indulge their desires.\nFor oneself,\nif one cannot abandon worldly attachments\nand instead drowns in sensory pleasures,\nday by day growing deeper in indulgence,\nthen the Great Simplicity is dissipated,\nand the Dao/Way is lost.\nHence it is said:\n*\"The people multiply in cleverness and artifice,\nand strange things arise in abundance.\"*\n\nLaws and decrees are but instruments of punishment and instruction—\nif they are excessive and harsh,\nthose who manipulate words and laws will thrive in their wickedness,\nwhile the people cannot bear the burden.\nThe small result in theft of wealth,\nthe great in theft of the state itself.\nFor oneself,\nif one is ensnared by petty laws,\nclinging to trifling rules,\nwhile external distractions multiply,\nthe heart grows restless and disordered—\nplundering one’s true nature,\nrobbing one’s innate purity—\nsuch is the chaos wrought.\nHence it is said:\n*\"Laws and decrees grow ever more explicit,\nyet thieves and robbers abound.\"*\n\nMaster He said:\n*\"The world abounds in taboos,\nand the people grow ever poorer\"—\nthis speaks of the state’s many restrictions.\nMountains and marshes each have their keepers,\nmarkets and passes each have their tolls,\ntaxes without measure,\nthe people burdened and weary.\nAs when Yanzi answered Duke Jiao of Qi,\n‘Every touch incurs a prohibition,\nthe people cannot endure it’—\nis this not the case of excessive taboos making the people ever poorer?\nFewer prohibitions mean peaceful livelihoods.\nThe Classics say:\n‘The state’s sharp tools\nshould not be displayed to the people.’\nIf the people multiply in sharp tools,\nthen the state grows ever more corrupt—\nfor fear they will seize the ruler’s authority.\nHence it is said:\n‘The craftsman should not indulge in excessive cleverness,\nfor his tools will then be complete yet undecorated.’\nIf the people multiply in clever artifice,\nstrange things arise in abundance—\nthis is to fear the corruption of simplicity and virtue.\nIf the ruler issues no harsh decrees,\nhis affairs proceed without disturbance,\nbut if the net is dense and the laws severe,\nwickedness cannot be contained,\nand the people will turn to thieves and robbers—\nthis is to fear the overreach of laws.\nThus one understands further:\n‘My non-doing, and the people transform themselves,\nmy love of stillness, and the people align themselves,\nmy non-interference, and the people grow rich,\nmy absence of desire, and the people return to simplicity.’\nThe ancient sages did not deceive me.\n\nMaster Li said:\n*\"Excessive taboos,\nexcessive sharp tools,\nexcessive clever artifice,\nexcessive laws and decrees—\nall are unnatural.\nFewer taboos, and the people prosper,\nabolish schemes of gain, and the people transform,\nreduce taxes and levies, and the people grow rich,\nguide them with virtue/power, and the people return to simplicity.\nHence the sages say:\n‘I do not act, and the people transform themselves,\nI love stillness, and the people align themselves,\nI do not interfere, and the people grow rich,\nI have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.’\n\nMaster Lü said:\n‘The Venerable Lord is the progenitor of ten thousand teachings,\nyet still he upholds the words of the ancient sages—\n“Guarding through humility,\nnot daring to reveal oneself.”\nThus, having state and people,\nhe makes no artificial constructions,\nnever failing to govern through non-doing,\nso the people fulfill their natural lives,\nand the common folk transform themselves.\n\nThe alchemists of the True One,\ntreat myself as the spirit,\nand the people as *qi*.\nSpirit condenses through non-doing,\nprimal *qi* transforms into fluid,\nfluid into blood,\nblood into sinew,\nsinew into bone,\nbone into marrow,\nmarrow into essence,\nessence into the Mysterious Pearl,\nthe Mysterious Pearl into Golden Elixir.\nThis is what the *Yīnfǔ Jīng* calls\n‘ten thousand transformations born from the body.’\nHence it is said:\n‘I do not act, and the people transform themselves.’\n\nModerate use and cherish the people,\nreject ornamentation and uphold substance—\nnever failing to prioritize frugality,\nthe people grow rich in their livelihoods,\nand their homes prosper naturally.\nThe alchemists of the True One,\nconstantly without desire, endure long life—\nenduring long life, *qi* fills the Three Fields within,\nhence it is said:\n‘I do not interfere, and the people grow rich.’\n\nPeaceful and still, unspeaking,\nsimple and undisturbed in self-cultivation—\nnever failing to uphold the root of virtue/power,\nthe people embrace Heaven’s completeness,\nand their customs become pure and correct.\nIf the human spirit is restless and agitated,\nthen *qi* becomes coarse and abrupt,\nbut if the spirit is tranquil and at ease,\nall gates flow harmoniously,\nand the primal *qi* aligns itself.\nHence it is said:\n‘I love stillness, and the people align themselves.’\n\nWithout desire, empty and boundless,\nvenerating the root and discarding the superficial—\nnever failing to pursue simplicity,\nthe people rise in aspiration,\nand their nature returns to simplicity.\nThe alchemists of the True One,\nwith the primal spirit serene and undisturbed,\ndesire unarisen,\n*qi* refined and spirit condensed,\nform the embryo and take shape—\nhence it is said:\n‘I have no desires, and the people return to simplicity.’\n\nMaster He said:\n‘*I do not act, and the people transform themselves*—\nif one acts, it ruins them,\nand the people will not transform.\n*I love stillness, and the people align themselves*—\nif one agitates and loses it,\nthe people will not align.\n*I do not interfere, and the people grow rich*—\nif one seeks contention, one invites calamity,\nand the people will not grow rich.’\"\n\nI have no desires, and the people return to simplicity—\nif one harbors many desires, one brings many burdens,\nand the people will not return to simplicity.\nThis is the essential Dao of supreme governance.\n\nIn ancient times, Master Guai excelled in governing with the Yellow Emperor’s teachings.\nWhat he spoke with Cao Pi of was solely:\n*\"Governance values stillness and clarity, and the people will settle themselves.\"*\nExpanding upon this principle,\nCao Pi grasped the method,\nand as Chancellor of the State of Qi for nine years,\nhe brought about great harmony.\n\nMaster Li said:\n*\"Non-action and non-desire,\nnon-interference and love of stillness—\nall are uprightness.\nTo govern with this,\nthe seas will be tranquil and the rivers clear;\nto practice the Dao with this,\nthe Way will flourish and the times will prosper;\nto cultivate oneself with this,\none’s *qi* will solidify and the spirit will condense.\nWhen one is upright, ten thousand are upright;\nwhen one heart is upright, ten thousand transformations are upright;\nwhen one body is upright, ten thousand affairs are upright.\nThe meaning of uprightness is vast indeed!\"*\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight**\nWhen governance is obscure and unadorned,\nits people are pure and unspoiled.\nWhen governance is scrutinizing and exacting,\nits people grow deficient.\n\nFortune and misfortune lean upon each other,\nmisfortune and fortune lie hidden within each other—\nwho can know their limits?\nWhat is upright may become strange,\nwhat is strange may become upright;\nwhat is good may become perverse,\nwhat is perverse may become good.\nThe people’s confusion has long been thus.\n\nMaster Lin said:\n*\"Obscure and unadorned\"* means not contriving cleverness.\n*\"Scrutinizing and exacting\"* means excessive fussing.\n*\"Pure and unspoiled\"* means self-contentment.\n*\"Deficient\"* means insufficiency.\nThis also conveys the idea:\nwhere there is intent, there is harm;\nwhere there is no intent, governance is self-regulating.\n\nMisfortune and fortune are not constant;\nthey lean upon and conceal each other—\nwho can know their ultimate end?\nUprightness is fixed,\nbut what is without uprightness?\nIt speaks of their endless leaning and concealment,\nimpossible to define.\n\nIn all under heaven,\nwhat is strange may become upright,\nwhat is upright may become strange,\nwhat is good may become perverse,\nwhat is perverse may become good—\nbenefit and harm, right and wrong—\nall follow this pattern.\nThis too is the meaning of misfortune and fortune leaning upon each other.\nThe world’s people are confused and do not know it,\nmerely dividing strange from upright,\nperverse from good—\ntheir confusion is not of one day’s making.\n\nMaster Li said:\nThe previous chapter spoke of non-action and non-interference,\nletting the people transform themselves—\na governance of broad tolerance.\nThus it follows with *\"governance is obscure and unadorned,\"*\nmeaning:\nwhen the ruler is tolerant and expansive, the people are sincere and genuine;\nwhen the ruler is overly active, the people grow dull and violent.\n*\"Obscure and unadorned\"* is tolerance,\n*\"scrutinizing and exacting\"* is meticulousness—\ntolerance wins the people,\nrigid law without flexibility harms them.\nMisfortune and fortune lean upon each other,\nuprightness and strangeness alternate,\ngood and perverse oppose each other—\nthis is the natural order.\nHow can one not take heed?\n\nCultivating fortune is not as good as avoiding misfortune,\npursuing uprightness is not as effective as avoiding perversity.\nThough uprightness is good,\nif one arrogantly claims extraordinary virtue,\nit becomes perverse.\nWhen uprightness is forced to be upright,\nit ceases to be upright.\nWhen goodness is forced to be good,\nit ceases to be good.\n\nMaster Lü said:\nThe ancients aligned with Heaven’s movements,\ntheir governance broad and natural,\nletting things unfold without interference—\never unadorned and obscure,\nthus their customs were pure and unspoiled.\nThose who cultivated the True Way\nembraced the boundless spirit,\nvast and tranquil,\nforgetting sight and sound,\nwithout distinction—\ntheir breathing deep and pure,\nand the Dao of transcendence was achieved.\nThus it is said:\n*\"When governance is obscure and unadorned,\nits people are pure and unspoiled.\"*\n\nLater rulers, with their rigid and hasty governance,\nused laws to bind the people,\ntheir scrutiny penetrating like a fishing net—\nyet they still deemed it insufficient.\nThe people’s loss of their nature\nwas never more severe.\nThus they constantly stumbled into prohibitions,\ntheir refinement and decay scattering,\nand customs daily declined.\n\nThose of shallow learning or just beginning the True Way,\nnot yet attaining Dao’s subtlety,\ntheir *qi* and spirit not yet condensed,\ntheir minds entangled in affairs,\nobsessed with minute scrutiny,\npraising cleverness and deceit—\nif they govern themselves thus,\nthey gasp and strain,\ntheir true essence departs,\nand this is not the Way of nurturing life.\nThus it is said:\n*\"When governance is scrutinizing and exacting,\nits people grow deficient.\"*\n\nMoreover, the origins of chaos and order,\nthe sources of misfortune and fortune—\nthese have existed since antiquity,\narising from human actions.\nWhen misfortune hides within fortune,\nif fortune reaches its peak\nand one cannot practice humility and fear,\nbut instead indulges in arrogance and excess,\nthere has never been one who did not invite misfortune.\n\nWhen fortune lies hidden within misfortune,\nif one, amid calamity and hardship,\nsuddenly abandons past errors\nand inwardly reflects,\nthen what was once hidden becomes fortune.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth has periods of rest and activity,\nthe revolutions of sun and moon have phases of waning and waxing—\nthis is the pattern of leaning and concealment,\nmisfortune and fortune arising in sequence,\ntheir limits unknown.\n\nThose who hold the world\nshould not seek to govern it with clarity and activity,\nbut instead let it unfold naturally,\nneither coveting wealth nor rejoicing in longevity,\nneither honoring prominence nor shaming poverty.\nThus misfortune and fortune lean upon each other—\nwhat concern are they to me?\n\nThose who cultivate the True Way\ndo not seek fortune first,\nnor invite misfortune.\nThey forget self and other—\nhow could misfortune and fortune’s leaning burden them?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Fortune and misfortune lean upon each other,\nmisfortune and fortune lie hidden within each other—\nwho can know their limits?\"*\nThe movements of yin and yang govern life and death,\nstasis and motion determine auspiciousness and calamity,\nuprightness and perversity, goodness and perversity—\nwho can define them?\n\nUprightness is the orthodox path,\nstrangeness is a deviant route,\ngoodness is innate nature,\nperversity is an aberrant kind.\nRooted in a single mind,\nthey branch into four—\nnot the harmony of a single *qi*.\n\nThose who claim to uphold uprightness\nmust be sages with deliberate intent,\nyet cunning and deceit\nonly harm what is upright.\nTo forcefully assert uprightness,\nomens and portents arise—\nthey harm what is good.\n\nGoodness and perversity, strangeness and uprightness,\nalternate in their influence,\nhuman nature is not singular,\nlost between perversity and uprightness—\ntheir confusion has endured for ages.\n\nTake those of mediocre or low station who have heard the Dao:\nthey may suddenly conceive a spark of goodness,\nyet lack the resolve to stand alone.\nConfused by appearances,\nin the blink of an eye,\nerrant thoughts arise—\nand uprightness becomes strangeness,\ngoodness and strangeness become perversity.\nAs Zhuangzi and the Sage said:\n*\"The divine and strange transform into rot and decay.\"*\n\nThe wisdom of the Sage is hard to fathom,\neven spirits and gods cannot discern it—\nhow much more so for the common flow?\n\n「Thus, people have long been mired in delusion and folly—\nit is not only a recent affliction.\nTherefore it is said:\n*When there is neither uprightness nor perversity,*\n*uprightness becomes strangeness,*\n*goodness becomes perversity.*\nThe people’s confusion,\nits duration has indeed been long.\n\nHence, the Sage is square yet does not sever,\nclean yet does not wound,\ndirect yet does not indulge,\nbright yet does not dazzle.\n\n**He Xian** says:\n*Severing is harming,*\n*wounding is injuring.*\nSquare yet not severed—\neasy to harm.\nClean yet not wounded—\neasy to injure.\nI use square and clean,\nleading by my own virtue,\nto let transformation unfold naturally—\nI would never do harm to others or injure them.\n\n*Indulging is excess,*\n*dazzling is ostentation.*\nDirect yet not indulgent—\neasy to flaunt.\nBright yet not dazzling—\neasy to blind.\nI use direct and bright,\nto show the Dao to the people,\nto let transformation unfold naturally—\nI would never indulge in self-aggrandizement or self-display.\n\n*Moderate yet not extreme*—\nan ancient complete phrase,\nas seen in the *Annotations of the Plenitude of Rites* (*Liji* 注).\nThose who alter *wounding* to *filth* are incorrect.\nIn *Zhuangzi*, *clean* and *wound* share similar meanings—\n*refined and polished*.\n\n**Dong Shi** says:\n*Square in conduct yet round in virtue,*\n*so there is no confusion of severing or wounding.*\nClean—\nto contain without harm.\nIndulging—\nto spread without restraint.\nThe great directness,\nthough appearing bent, does not indulge,\nbright yet not dazzling—\nrestoring its clarity.\nThese four are the essence of governance.\n\nThe Sage alone maintains tranquility and non-action,\nusing square, clean, direct, and bright principles within—\norderly yet imperceptible to people.\nHe lets all under heaven dwell in their natural states,\nunentangled by one-sided extremes—\nthus avoiding severing, wounding, indulging, and dazzling.\nThen, how can misfortune or blessing arise?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Governing People and Serving Heaven, Nothing Exceeds Frugality**\n\n**Lü Shi** says:\nThe Sage’s governance,\nwith non-action and non-interference,\nsaves resources and restrains expenditure—\nthen the granaries are full,\nthe people prosper, and customs flourish.\nThen, preserving vitality and cherishing spirit,\nunifying the heart and purifying the self,\nto manifestly honor the sacrifice to the Supreme Sovereign—\nboth people and gods are in harmony.\n\nMoreover, the Sage’s **cleverness and wisdom**,\nhis **movement and stillness**, his **thought and contemplation**—\nthese are the inner fulfillments of his mind.\nHis **bending and stretching**, his **bowing and rising**,\nhis **appearance, voice, and color**—\nthese are the outer fulfillments of his body.\nThe two must harmonize,\nnaturally aligned—\nthe key lies in each attaining its proper measure.\nThis is the meaning of **frugality**.\n\nCultivating the inner\nis the way to govern people—\ngoverning oneself to govern others.\nCherishing the **primordial essence** (*yuan* 元)\nis the way to serve Heaven—\nserving one’s own Heaven.\n\nHeaven is the **cerebral palace** (*nao gong* 脑宫),\npure Yang radiant and vast,\ndwelling in the **Upper Nine** (*Shang Jiu* 上九),\nabove which there is no Yin.\nFrom the **Jade Capital Gate** (*Yujing Guan* 玉京关) upward,\nall is Heaven.\n\nFrugality is **preservation and cherishing**.\nCherishing vision nourishes the spirit,\ncherishing hearing nourishes the **void** (*xu* 虚),\ncherishing speech nourishes the **qi**,\ncherishing rest nourishes **harmony** (*he* 和),\ncherishing the brain nourishes the blood—\nthus it is said:\n*Governing people and serving Heaven,*\n*nothing exceeds frugality.*\n\n**He Xian** says:\nThe ruler stands at the juncture of Heaven and humanity.\nWhatever is used to serve Heaven above,\nand govern people below,\noften seeks from without—\nyet does not seek within the self.\nThe **Grand Historian** (*Sima Qian* 司马迁) placed Dao first among the Six Schools,\ntaking its **singular focus** (*shen* 神) as the **Great Dao** (*Dadao* 大道),\nsaying *\"movement aligns with the formless\"*—\nthis is harmony with Heaven.\nSaying *\"sufficiently nourishing all things\"*—\nthis also nourishes the people.\nAgain, he said:\n*The essence of what humans bear is spirit,*\n*what they rely upon is form.*\nIf **vitality** (*jing* 精) is overused, it is exhausted;\nif **spirit** (*shen* 神) is overused, it is fatigued.\nWhen spirit departs, death ensues—\nthus the Sage treasures it.\n\nTreasure—\nthis is the meaning of **frugality**.\nFrugality is the utmost **parsimony**.\nThe Sage guards the inner yet does not guard the outer.\nWhen he speaks of **restraint** (*jie* 节),\n**cherishing** (*ai* 爱),\n**preservation** (*shou* 守)—\nall are frugality’s intent.\n\nNot frugal with the mouth leads to excessive speech and depleted **qi**.\nThe five flavors, if indulged, impair vitality;\nnot frugal with ears and eyes leads to the five sounds confusing the ears,\nthe five colors confusing the eyes—\nas it says,\n*\"To indulge one’s desires*\n*fatigues the spirit.\"*\nThus, **frugality in vitality, qi, and spirit**—\nthis, on the Dao’s path,\ncan be **guest of the Nine Purity** (*Jiu Qing* 九清),\nand below,\ncan bless all living beings.\n\n**Wu Shi** says:\nSound—\nthe essential **guardian of form** (*liu xing xi qi* 留形惜气),\nthe **vital screen** (*yao wei* 要卫).\n\n**Li Shi** says:\nGoverning people and serving Heaven,\nnothing exceeds **beginning with frugality**.\nSpeaking of the state,\nit means **reducing punishments** and **lightening taxes**.\nSpeaking of the self,\nit means **restraining speech** and **moderating drink and food**.\nSpeaking of the heart,\nit means **limiting thought** and **cutting off vision and hearing**,\npreserving the heart and nurturing nature—\nthus one can serve Heaven.\n\nFrugality alone is called **early restoration** (*zao fu* 早复).\nEarly restoration is **heavily accumulating virtue** (*zhong ji de* 重积德).\nHeavily accumulating virtue—\nnothing cannot be overcome.\nNothing cannot be overcome—\nits limits are unknown.\nIts limits unknown—\none can have a state.\n\n**Lü Shi** says:\nMoreover, **frugality**—\ncherishing and nurturing the spirit,\ndiligently practicing moderation with constancy—\nlike nature, unchanging;\nlike virtue, unshifting.\nRestraining expenditure and storing resources,\nself-sufficient in frugality—\nwhile wisdom and tranquility mutually nourish,\ndesires do not stray outward.\nNature restores itself from within—\nas when one cherishes form,\npreserves spirit,\nhonors qi,\nand stabilizes the root.\nSpirit, brain, and blood—\nnot wasted or scattered.\nEarly to restore the original and return to the essence—\nthus it is said:\n**Frugality alone is early restoration.**\n\nCultivating the inner—\nearly frugality leads to restoration,\nthen **qi softens** and **harmonizes**,\nall spirits find ease,\nrestoring one’s original nature—\nnot swayed by external things.\nDeep and distant—\nthus it is said: **early restoration.**\n\nCalled **heavily accumulating virtue**—\nyet **heavy accumulation** means\n**overcoming oneself to return to propriety** (*ke ji fu li* 克己复礼),\n**cultivating the Dao with benevolence** (*xiu dao yi ren* 修道以仁).\nNever indulging in **ostentation or commercialization** (*xuan yu* 眩鬻),\nHeaven and humanity trust and obey—\nno thing dares defy.\nThus, the four quarters **reverently emulate**,\nnothing resists or conquers—\nhence the saying:\n*Heavily accumulating virtue,*\n*its limits are unknown.*」\n\n「Thus it is said: **Heavily accumulating virtue**, then nothing fails to be overcome.\nAnd when nothing fails to be overcome,\nthe myriad things return to their transformations,\nvirtue and Dao are boundless—\nwhere shall it not prevail?\nThose who refine within,\ngreat virtue abides with ease,\nfor they do not contend—\nwhat then can they not overcome?\nReaching the One without resistance,\ntrue constancy never alters.\nAttuning to the Ten Thousand Ages yet never aging—\nwho can fathom its limits?\nThus it is said: **Heavily accumulating virtue**, then its limits are unknown.\n\nWhen its limits are beyond knowing,\none’s body follows yet precedes itself;\nthe world joyfully extols it without wearying.\nEnjoying the Ren of Yao,\ndelighting in the transformations of Yao,\nhis realm is preserved with ample surplus.\n\nThose who refine within,\nembody the boundless Dao,\nand nurture virtue without end—\na realm that can be secured\nis like a body that can endure.\nThus it is said: **Its limits are unknown**, yet one can have a realm.\n\n○ Master He says:\n**Heavily accumulating virtue**—\nthen gathered water becomes the sea,\ngathered qi becomes the spirit.\nNothing fails to be overcome—\nthen it responds to all things in transformation,\nadapting to every circumstance without fail.\nWhen its limits are beyond knowing,\nit aligns with the Great Dao,\nmysterious and profound—\nif rulers truly follow this Way,\nthey can secure their realm and endure in lasting peace.\n\n○ Master Lin says:\nThis chapter speaks of **early restoration**—\nwhen one is frugal, it returns to the root,\nreverting to the origin and restoring the essence.\nWhen virtue reaches this point,\nit grows ever more abundant and flourishing.\n**Heavily accumulating** means ever-increasing virtue.\nThe foundation of a lasting realm—\nthis is the Way of deep roots and firm bases,\nof enduring life and long vision.\n\n○ Master Lü says:\nAt first, one cultivates nature to return to virtue,\nnow one accumulates virtue to enter the Dao.\nAs the foundation of a realm,\nit can nourish the people abundantly,\nbestow blessings upon the land and its altars,\nand span the eternal ages.\nComparing it to the body—\nthe foundation of a realm is qi,\nand form is the basis that receives qi.\nQi is the root of form,\nborn from spirit and consciousness,\nwhile form arises from qi.\nThus, Fu Xi attained it to inherit the **Qi Mother**,\nfor spirit is the child of qi,\nwhile qi is the mother of spirit.\n\nForm cannot exist without qi—\nit has no foundation.\nQi cannot govern form—\nthen what can be its master?\nWhen qi disperses, the body decays;\nwhen qi remains, the body endures long.\nThus it is said: **The foundation of a realm**, can endure long.\nThe ruler who accumulates virtue,\ngoverns humanity and serves Heaven,\nnurtures the realm and cares for the people—\nplants his roots in **non-action**,\nfirmly secures his base in **clarity and tranquility**,\nand the altars of soil and grain stretch far.\nThus it is called the **Way of enduring life**.\nEver ruling with constant illumination,\nthus it is called the **Way of long vision**.\nOne’s own root is the brain,\none’s own base is the navel.\nDeep roots draw upon the **Original Qi** to nourish the brain—\nthe **immortal’s saying** goes:\n*To attain non-aging, return essence to nourish the brain.*\nThen, sealing the pivotal mechanisms,\nclosing the gates of desire,\nhiding the **Original Essence** in the **obscure palace**,\nand forming the **fetal breath** in the **Cinnabar Court**—\nabove red, below black,\nleft blue, right white,\nwithin the yellow radiance of the center,\nlies the **Yellow Court’s treasure**,\nright at the navel—\nthis is called **firmly securing the base**.\nNow, to cultivate **enduring life**,\nfirst one must **secure the base**,\nbreathing in harmony with **Great Unity**,\nreturning the spirit and taming the qi,\nwith **fetal breath** continuous and abiding in the navel,\n**enduring life** becomes as constant as Heaven and Earth,\nand **long vision** shines like the sun and moon.\n\nThe **immortal’s saying** declares:\n*To attain enduring life, one must first achieve long vision.*\n**Long vision** is **inner vision**.\n\n○ Master Lin says:\nThis chapter uses governing a realm to illustrate **nourishing life**.\nIf one can be frugal in nourishing life,\nthen one can deepen the roots,\nfirm the base,\nattain enduring life,\nand achieve long vision.\n\n○ Master Su says:\nUsing **frugality** to govern the people,\none can secure a realm.\nUsing **frugality** to serve Heaven,\none plants deep roots and secures the base.\nThe ancient sages\npreserved their **nature and life’s constancy**,\nnot wasting the inner through external excess—\nthen their roots are deep, their bases firm,\nand nothing can uproot them.\nThough **enduring life** and **long vision** may follow,\n**frugality** alone is supreme in governing people and serving Heaven.\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty: Governing a Great Realm, Like Cooking a Small Fresh Fish.**\n\n○ Master Lü says:\nGoverning a great realm—\none must not **harass** it, for harassment brings disorder.\nCooking a small fresh fish—\none must not **disturb** it, for disturbance makes it rot.\nThus, the adept ruler\ncooks a fish no larger than a palm,\nadjusting the **water and fire**,\nletting it cook itself—\nthen the fish remains whole.\nIf one disturbs it, the fish is damaged,\nand it spoils in the pot.\n\nThe adept governor\nharmonizes his **policies and teachings**,\nletting the people find their own way—\nthen the people are naturally at ease.\nIf one disturbs them, the people are harmed,\nand they scatter from the realm.\nThus, the **Way of governance values clarity and tranquility**,\nthe realm depends on the people,\nthe body depends on qi.\nLoving the people and governing the realm—\nthen the realm prospers.\nLoving qi and governing the body—\nthen the body endures long.\nHence this illustration is set forth.\n\nThe method of **loving the people and conserving qi**\nis like cooking a small fresh fish—\ndo not stir it,\nfor agitation wastes and ruins it.\n\n○ Master Li says:\nGoverning with **rectitude**,\none’s policies are **profound and subtle**.\nGoverning people and serving Heaven—\nall are the **meaning of governance**.\nA small fresh fish—\na tiny fish.\nUsing it as an analogy,\nif one stirs it, it disintegrates—\nspeaking of governing the world,\nif one disturbs it, chaos ensues.\n\n○ Master Lin says:\nCooking a small fresh fish—\nif one stirs it, it breaks apart.\nGoverning a realm—\nif one disturbs it, disorder arises.\n**Clarity and tranquility, non-action,**\npeace and stillness without disturbance—\nthis is the **Way of governance**.\n\n---\n**Governing the world with the Dao, the spirits lose their power.**\n\n○ Master Lü says:\nThe sage is **divinely illuminated**,\nthe master of all things.\nThough compelled to govern the world,\nhe employs the **Way of non-action** to rule it.\nThus the winds and rains come in due measure,\nfloods and droughts do not arise.\nHuman hearts are **purified and harmonized**,\nand the spirits and gods all submit to **illuminated virtue**.\nThe spirits, content in their **hidden realms**,\ndare not emit their **mysterious sounds**,\nnor display their **divine transformations**.\nIf one governs the world within one’s own body\nwith the Dao,\nthen **serenity and simplicity** mutually nourish,\nthe **divine abode** is **calm and settled**,\ninner **Heavenly Light** radiates,\n**evil spirits** are **extinguished**,\nand how dare the **malevolent ghosts** show their **divine transformations**?\n\n○ **Master Wu says:**\n\"Governing\" is the same as \"descending.\"\n\"Ghosts\" refer to the **qi of Heaven and Earth**—**divine and numinous** forces, **portents and omens**.\n\nHumankind’s **qi** flows as one with the **qi of Heaven and Earth**.\nThe sovereign who follows the **Dao** descends upon the world with **serenity and simplicity**,\ndoes not disturb or harm the people,\nso the people’s **qi** becomes **purified and harmonized**,\nfilling the **Heavenly and Earthly realms**,\nmutually resonating in **correspondence and response**,\nand the **qi of Heaven and Earth** does not dare to act in **contrariety or perversity**,\nso its **ghostly portents** do not become **malevolent omens** to bring calamity.\n\n○ **Master He says:**\nTo govern the world with the **Dao** is to **divinely illuminate** the people and bring them **serenity**.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says, the sage descends upon the world only when compelled,\nand nothing surpasses **non-action**.\n**Non-action** means the people find **tranquility in their natural lives**,\nacting without interference, yet ever **spontaneously**,\nand nothing can harm them.\n\n○ **Riverbank Master** [河上公] says:\nWhen one holds office by **Dao and virtue** and governs the world,\nthe **ghosts** dare not display their **spiritual essence** to offend humanity.\nIt is not that their **spiritual essence** is absent—\nrather, they cannot harm those who live in **natural harmony**.\nNor is it that they are unable to harm—\nthe sage also does not harm them.\n**Master Lü says:**\nIt is not that the **ghosts** lack **divine transformations** and **mysterious sounds**,\nbut rather that the sage maintains his **proper station**,\nand the **ghosts** ought to **reverently praise** the **grand beauty of Heaven and Earth**,\n**assisting and harmonizing** with **illuminated virtue**,\nfittingly bestowing blessings,\nand not merely refraining from **malevolent omens** and **mysterious transformations**\nto harm the people.\n\nMoreover, the **Daoist sage** does not allow the **ghosts** to display their **divine transformations**,\nfor they cannot harm those who abide in **natural harmony**.\nThus it is said: *\"It is not that the ghosts lack spiritual essence—\nrather, they cannot harm those who live in natural harmony.\"*\nWhen the **spiritual essence** is **settled in rectitude**,\nit does not harm the people,\nfor it submits to the **illuminated virtue** of the sage,\nretiring into **hidden realms** and not daring to reveal its **portents and omens**.\n\nThe sage pities even a single individual who has lost his **proper place**,\nnever failing to consider the means to **rescue and sustain** him.\nJust as a father nurtures his child,\nthough he wraps and swaddles him,\nhis care is ever **vigilant and tender**—\nhow could he harm him?\nThis is like the **Daoist sage** abiding in **natural harmony**,\nwhere not only the **ghosts** dare not offend,\nbut the sage himself does not harm them either.\nThe sage, who **honors the Dao** and **values virtue**,\nwould never harm those who follow the **Dao**!\n\nThus it is said: *\"It is not that the spiritual essence cannot harm—\nrather, the sage does not harm them.\"*\n\n○ **Master Wu says:**\nThe reason the **ghosts** do not become **portents and omens** is not that they are incapable—\nthough they can become **portents and omens**, they do not act in **malevolence** to harm humanity.\nAgain, the **ghosts'** portents and omens** do not harm humanity not because they are inherently so,\nbut because the sage can **purify and harmonize** the people’s **qi** without harming the **qi of Heaven and Earth**,\nso the **qi of Heaven and Earth** also remains **purified and harmonized** and does not harm humanity.\nThe terms **\"ghosts\"** and **\"spiritual essence\"** both refer to the **qi of Heaven and Earth**,\ntwo names yet one reality.\n\n○ **Riverbank Master** [河上公] says:\nThe **ghosts** are not without **spiritual essence**—\nthey simply cannot harm those who live in **natural harmony**.\nWhen both sides do not harm each other,\n**virtue and power** mutually return to their source.\n\n○ **Master Lü says:**\nHumans are governed by the **yang**, the **ghosts** by the **yin**.\nHumans **preserve their natural lives**,\nwhile the **ghosts** **fulfill their divine spirits**.\nBoth sides, in **reciprocal delight**, do not harm one another,\nleading to **Heaven’s clarity and Earth’s peace**,\n**harmony between yin and yang**,\n**abundant harvests each year**,\n**no creatures maimed or lost**,\n**no flaws in the state**,\n**no plagues among the people**,\n**no malevolent omens from the ghosts**—\nthus **virtue and power** mutually return to their source.\n\n○ **Master Lin** [林氏] says:\n**Hidden realms** manifest as **yin and yang**,\nwhile **illuminated governance** is the **sage’s proper station**.\nThese two aspects inherently do not harm each other,\nso their **virtue and power** mutually return.\nThis means **Heaven and Earth** follow their **natural Dao**,\nand the sage also follows the **natural Dao**,\neach preserving their own **virtue and power** without encroachment,\nhence the saying: *\"They mutually return.\"*\n\n**Not harming** means **not encroaching**.\nThis passage first presents a general statement,\nthen elaborates on the **Way of the Three Powers**—\nall of it is about **non-action**.\nTo govern the world with the **Dao** is to encompass the **Three Powers** [Heaven, Earth, humanity].\nAll things beneath the **Great Void** [太虚]\nare governed by the **Dao**:\n**Heaven** fulfills its role of **covering and nurturing**,\n**Earth** fulfills its role of **bearing and sustaining**,\nand the sage fulfills his role of **teaching and guiding**.\nWhen each fulfills its own role without encroaching,\nall attain their **Dao**.\n\n○ **Riverbank Master** [河上公] says:\nThe **ghosts** and the **sage** both do not harm each other.\nWhen neither harms the other,\nhumans are governed by the **yang**,\nwhile the **ghosts** are governed by the **yin**,\nhumans **preserve their natural lives**,\nand the **ghosts** **fulfill their divine spirits**—\nthus **virtue and power** mutually return.\n\n○ **Master He** [何氏] says:\nThe ancient people dwelled in the **indistinct void** [混茫],\nand with the world they **dissolved in tranquility**.\nAt that time,\n**yin and yang** knew **stillness**,\n**ghosts and gods** did not disturb,\nthe **Four Seasons** followed their **proper rhythms**,\nand all things were **unharmed**.\nThough creatures had **awareness**,\nthey **did not apply it**—\nthis was called **\"Absolute Unity\"**,\nwhere **non-action** and **spontaneity** prevail eternally.\nThis is the case.\n\n**Chapter 61:**\n*\"Great states are the lower streams [of the world],\nthe **confluence of all things**,\nthe **yin of the world**.*\n*The **yin** always overcomes the **yang** by **stillness**,\nand **stillness** is the **yin**’s way.*\n\n○ **Master Lin** [林氏] says:\nBorrowing the **principle of great states and small states**,\nhe illustrates that the **Daoist sage** ought to **be humble and still**,\nnot teaching people to **submit themselves** to gain victory.\nSince the **Three Dynasties** onward,\nthere have been those who **seize states**,\nso he uses their observations as an analogy.\n\n*\"Lower streams\"* means to **place oneself in a humble station**.\nThe people of great states,\nif they **humble themselves**,\ncan **unite the world’s confluence**,\njust as the **yin** overcomes the **yang** by **stillness**.\nTo **humble oneself** is to **abide in stillness** as the **Dao**,\nhence the saying: *\"Stillness is the yin’s way.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lü** [吕氏] says:\nThe reason the **seas and rivers** can be the **\"sovereigns of all valleys\"** [百谷]\nis that they **excel in humility**.\nAll streams **converge at the river’s source** [朝宗],\njust as great states, through **humility and inclusivity**,\ncan **unite all people** without exception.\nThe **Classics** say:\n*\"When Heaven and Earth’s **qi** converge, all things are born.\nWhen the **Dao of humanity** converges, **achievements and merit** are fulfilled.\"*\nThis is what is meant by *\"confluence.\"*\n\nThe establishment of **one body** is the **mirror of a state**.\nTo **forget one’s body** is to **order all limbs**,\nTo **empty one’s heart** is to **return to harmony with the **qi****.\nThe **emptiness and nothingness** are where **sages dwell**,\nWhich can be called a **great state**.\n\nBecause it **does not contend**,\nThe **world cannot contend with it**.\nEven the **essence of all things**,\nWhen **converged and united**,\nIs like the **many waters rushing to the lowlands**.\nHence the saying: *\"Great states are the lowlands.\"*\n\nThe **confluence of the world**,\nThe **yin of the world**,\nDoes not initially **hold the heart to victory**,\nOnly through **stillness** does it always prevail.\nTo **prevail through stillness** is to **abide in humility**,\nHence the **world’s confluence** returns to it.\n\n**Yin is still, yang is dynamic**,\nSoftness is still, hardness is active.\nHardness is **overcome by softness**,\nActivity is **subdued by stillness**.\nThe **Classics** say:\n*\"Know the **heroic**,\nGuard the **receptive**,\nAnd you will be the **valley of the world**.\"*\nThis is indeed the **virtue of humility and abasement**,\nWhich ensures **no undertaking fails**—\n**Victory is inherent in oneself**.\n\n**Heaven’s One** generates **water**,\nIn humans, this is **precision**.\n**Earth’s Two** generates **fire**,\nIn humans, this is **divine spirit**.\n**Divine spirit** is the **yin within the yang**,\nHence it is called **receptive**,\nAlso the **yin of the world**.\nTo **know the heroic and guard the receptive**,\nTo **focus the **qi** and cultivate softness**,\nTo **refine yang with yin**,\nIs the **mysterious and wondrous application**,\nHence **yin always prevails through stillness**.\n\n**Stillness** attracts **all movements**,\n**Humility** draws **all people**—\nThis is the **key to cultivating the **True Dao****.\nHence, **great states humble themselves to small states**,\nAnd **gain the small states**.\n**Small states humble themselves to great states**,\nAnd **gain the great states**.\nSometimes **humility leads to gain**,\nSometimes **humility brings gain**.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nTo **gain through greatness** is called *\"gain\"* (以取),\nTo **gain through smallness** is called *\"while taking\"* (而取).\nThese two phrases are **most profound**.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nTo **serve small states with greatness**,\nOnly **benevolence** can achieve this.\nTo **serve great states with smallness**,\nOnly **wisdom** can achieve this.\nThose who **serve small states with greatness** are **rejoicing in Heaven’s Dao**,\nThose who **serve great states with smallness** are **fearing Heaven’s Dao**.\nThe **rejoicing in Heaven’s Dao** know **Heaven’s command**,\nThe **fearing Heaven’s Dao** **preserve themselves**.\n\n**Master Wu** says:\n**Great states**, originally **above small states**,\nDo not **rely on their exalted status** but **humble themselves below small states**,\nThus **attracting the small states’ joyful submission**.\n**Small states**, naturally **below great states**,\n**Gladly abide in humility** and **bow to the great states**,\nThus **earning the great states’ favor**.\n*\"Humility leads to gain\"* means **great states** can **humble themselves to gain small states’ joyful submission**,\n*\"Humility brings gain\"* means **small states** can **humble themselves to earn great states’ favor**.\n\n**Master He** says:\n**Great states humble themselves to small states**,\nLike **Tang serving Ge**,\nOr **King Wen serving the Kun Yi**.\n**Small states humble themselves to great states**,\nLike **King Tai serving the Xi Yu**,\nOr **King Gu of Yue serving Wu**—\nSuch examples.\n\n**Master Li** says:\n**Superiors humble themselves to inferiors**,\n**Inferiors humble themselves to superiors**,\n**Superiors yield to inferiors, inferiors comply with superiors**—\nThus **virtue and Way return to their confluence**.\n**Cultivating oneself** with this principle:\nThe **heart grows more humble**, the **Way grows more exalted**,\nThe **body grows more retiring**, the **virtue grows more refined**.\n**Great states** only **seek to embrace and nurture all people**,\n**Small states** only **seek to be included in service**.\nIf both **fulfill their desires**,\nThen **greatness is fitting to abide in humility**.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nThe **intent of great states** is only **to embrace and nurture all people**,\nThe **intent of small states** is only **to carve and inscribe themselves** in seeking service.\nBoth must **abide in humility**—\nOnly through **humility** can each **fulfill their desires**,\nThus the **greatest understanding of the Way** must **favor humility and abasement**.\n\n**Master Wu** says:\nWhen **great states humble themselves to small states**,\nIt is only **to embrace and nurture the small states**.\nWhen **small states humble themselves to great states**,\nIt is only **to seek inclusion in service**.\nIf both **abide in humility**,\nThen **great and small each attain their desires**,\nYet the **small ones** are naturally **beneath others**,\nAnd **do not fear their inability to humble themselves**,\nWhile the **great ones**, not naturally **beneath others**,\n**May fear their inability**—\nHence it is **specifically emphasized** that the **great ones should abide in humility**.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nWhen **great states humble themselves to small states**,\nIt is only **to annex and embrace the small states’ people**,\nMaking them **their rulers and leaders**.\nWhen **small states humble themselves to great states**,\nIt is only **to offer proper rites** and **reverently serve the great states**,\nSeeking **aid and support**.\nYet **great and small** each **fulfill their proper roles**,\n**Mutually holding firm** without **encroaching or provoking**,\n**Content in their dwellings**,\n**Rejoicing in their customs**,\nAnd **small states naturally submit in softness**—\nThis is the **natural order**.\n\n**Great states** practice **humility and abasement**,\nHence they **should bend and yield** to **preserve completeness**,\nMaking **great and small adaptable**,\nThus **attracting the world’s confluence**.\n\n**Master He** says:\nThis chapter **begins with \"Great states are the lowlands\"**,\nAnd **ends with \"Greatness is fitting to abide in humility\"**,\nThough **great and small states are discussed together**,\nThe **primary focus is always on the great states**.\nThe **small ones** easily **abide in humility**,\nThis **requires no instruction**,\nThe **great ones**, prone to **excess and pride**,\nFind **humility difficult**—\nEven with instruction, they **may not comply**.\nHence it is **repeatedly emphasized**,\nIn alignment with the **same Way as the *I Ching*** (*易*).\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two**\nThe **Dao** is the **mysterious core of all things**.\n\nThe **virtuous** hold **Dao** as their treasure,\nWhile the **unvirtuous** rely upon it for **safeguard**.\n\n**Master He** says:\nThe **Dao** molds and refines all things,\nPolishes the formless,\nSilent and unmoving—\nThe **Great Dao** is **mysterious and obscure**,\nDeep, vast, and boundless,\nUnattainable from without,\nUnfathomable within—\nThis is what is called the **mysterious core of all things**.\nLike the **inner sanctum of a hall**,\nNot glimpsed in haste,\nAs *Zhuangzi* says, the **Dao** is the **shared source of all things**,\nHence this chapter first speaks of **treasure**, then of **nobility**.\n\nThe **Dao** does not distance itself from people—\nPeople distance themselves from the **Dao**.\nThough there is a distinction between **virtuous** and **unvirtuous**,\nEven the **unvirtuous** rely upon it in hidden ways for **security**.\n\n**Master Wu** says:\nThe **mysterious core of all things** refers to what is **most honored**—\n*\"Olymp\"* (奥) is the **west-south corner of a hall**, where the **noble** reside,\nThus *\"Olymp\"* signifies **nobility**.\nThe **nobility of the Dao** is like this.\n**Treasure** is what the **virtuous** value—\nWhen the **virtuous** turn toward the **Dao** and cultivate it,\nThey gain **esteem from others**,\nHence it is said: *\"The treasure of the virtuous.\"*\nWhen the **unvirtuous** turn toward the **Dao** and repent,\nThey may yet **preserve themselves**,\nHence it is said: *\"The safeguard of the unvirtuous.\"*\n**Graceful speech** can be **traded in the market**,\n**Noble conduct** can **elevate others**.\nWhy should the **unvirtuous** be **cast aside**?\nThus, when establishing the **Son of Heaven** and appointing the **Three Ministers**,\nEven with **jewel-encircled jade and four-horse chariots** offered first,\nIt is **not as valuable** as **sitting and advancing this Dao**.\n\n**Master Li** says:\n**Graceful speech** can be **traded in the market**—\nSufficient to **please the multitude**,\n**Noble conduct** can **elevate others**—\nSufficient to **rise above the crowd**.\nIf a person is **unvirtuous**, why **abandon them**?\nTo establish the **Son of Heaven** and appoint the **Three Ministers** is to **make them rulers and teachers**,\nTo **cultivate the people below**,\nSo that the **unvirtuous** follow their **transformations**.\n**Jewel-encircled jade and four-horse chariots** are **not truly noble**—\nNot as noble as **sitting and advancing this Dao**,\nCultivating oneself to **settle the people**,\nLeading with **respect and humility** so they **do not contend**,\nDisplaying **virtue and righteousness** so they **upright their conduct**,\nDemonstrating **approval and disapproval** so they **know prohibitions**—\nThus the **Sage** always **rescues people with virtue**,\nAnd **never abandons anyone**.\n\n**Master Chai** says:\nThe **Dao’s flavor** is **beneficial**—\nLike **treasure brought to market**,\nHence *\"graceful speech can be traded in the market.\"*\n**Virtue’s weight** is **irresistible**,\nHence *\"noble conduct can elevate others.\"*\nIf a person is **unvirtuous**, why **abandon them**?\nTeach them to **transform**—\nHow dare one **abandon them**?\nThus, establishing the **Son of Heaven** and appointing the **Three Ministers** is to **assist in advancing this Dao**.\n\n**Master Wu** says:\nThe **virtuous** gain **esteem from others** through the **Dao**—\nTheir **praiseworthy words** are **lovable**, like **fine goods sold in the market**,\nTheir **exalted deeds** are **worthy of veneration**, rising above others.\nThe **unvirtuous** preserve themselves through the **Dao**—\nFearful of **punishment**, few in **guilt**, their **bodies remain whole and secure**,\nThus even the **unvirtuous**—\nHow could the **Dao** ever **abandon them**?\n**Jewel-encircled jade**—a **jewel held in both hands**—\n**Four-horse chariots**—a **single team of horses**,\n**Jewel-encircled jade and four-horse chariots** are **the height of nobility**,\nYet they are **not truly noble**.\nNot as noble as **advancing this Dao**—\n**Jewel-encircled jade and four-horse chariots** are **not as noble as this Dao**,\nHence all things **hold it in highest esteem** as their **mysterious core**.\n\n**Master He** says:\nNot to **glory in jade, gems, or chariots**,\nBut to **hold advancing this Dao as noble**.\nWhy did the **ancients** hold this **Dao** in such **nobility**?\nWas it not because **seeking it brings attainment**,\nAnd **guilt is pardoned**?\nThus it is **noble for all under Heaven**.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nMoreover, why did the **ancients** hold this **Dao** in such **nobility**?\nBecause **seeking it brings attainment**—\nThe **Dao** is **within oneself**,\nTo **practice virtue** depends on **oneself**, not others.\nTo **pardon guilt**—\nA single **virtuous thought** can **correct errors**,\nEven the **wicked**, through **fasting, purification, and bathing**, may **offer sacrifice to the Most High**.\nIt is not said, *\"As the *Poetry Classic* does not say?\"*\nThe **Dao** knows **no distinction between wise and foolish**—\n**Awakening brings attainment**,\nThis is why it is **truly noble**,\nHence it is said: *\"Thus it is noble for all under Heaven.\"*\n\n**Master He** says:\nWithout a single person **not gaining what they desire** or **gathering what they seek**,\nAll their **pursuits are fulfilled**.\nThe **Noble One** delights in **attaining the Dao** and **rests in virtue**,\nThe **petty person** delights in **attaining desires** but **shames unvirtue**,\nEven those who are **unvirtuous** yet **turn their hearts toward the Dao**,\n**Shift toward virtue and distance guilt**—\nUnaware, they do so.\nThis is how those **who embody the Dao** gain **great use in the world**,\nAnd it also **reveals the Dao’s efficacy**—\nThe more **noble**, the more **esteemed**,\nThus it is said: *\"The ancients held this Dao in nobility\"*—\nNot of **this present age alone**, but **throughout antiquity**.\nThus it is.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three**\n**Act without acting**,\n**Manage without managing**,\n**Savor without savoring**.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nThe **Sage acts without purpose**,\nYet **trusts in things’ natural self-so**,\nThus **without acting, nothing remains undone**—\nHow could the **heart** ever **cease moving**?\n**Manages without interference**,\nYet **follows things’ natural affairs**,\nThus **without managing, nothing remains unattended**—\nHow could the **body** ever **cease laboring**?\n**Savors without indulgence**,\nYet **follows things’ inherent flavors**,\nThus **without savoring, nothing remains unsavored**—\nHow could the **mouth** ever **cease craving**?\nWhen the **heart is unmoved**, all **wonders are visible**,\nWhen the **body is unlabored**, **spirit is undiminished**,\nWhen the **mouth is unindulgent**, **essence is undrained**—\nThe **Perfect One** **acts in cultivation and nourishment**,\nYet **does not engage in reckless deeds**,\n**Attends to True Refining**,\nYet **does not involve themselves in worldly affairs**,\n**Savors in virtue and morality**,\nYet **does not indulge in carrion and rank odors**,\nHence it is said:\n**Act without acting**,\n**Manage without managing**,\n**Savor without savoring**.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nOnly when **acting without acting** can one **do all things**,\nHence *\"Act without acting.\"*\nOnly when **managing without managing** can one **gather all affairs**,\nHence *\"Manage without managing.\"*\nOnly when **indulging without indulging** can one **truly know flavor**,\nHence *\"Savor without savoring.\"*\n\n**Master Li** says:\n**Act without acting**—\nThis **unfolds the mysterious core of all things** from the previous chapter.\n**Act without acting**—\n**Nothing remains undone**,\n**Manage without managing**—\n**All affairs succeed**,\n**Savor without savoring**—\nIts **flavor is profound and enduring**—\nThese three are the **Dao’s mysterious core**.\n\n**Great and small, much and little,**\n**Repay resentment with virtue,**\n**Plan for difficulty in its ease,**\n**Achieve the great through the minute.**\n\n**The world’s difficult tasks**\n**Must begin in simplicity,**\n**The world’s grandest deeds**\n**Must arise from the fine.**\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nWhen dealing with the formed,\nThere are great and small,\nWhen bound to the formed,\nThere are much and little.\nThough things are boundless in measure,\nTheir utility is rooted—\nRespond without hoarding,\nEntrust to innate constancy.\nWhen great is needed, be great,\nWhen small is needed, be small,\nWhen much is needed, be much,\nWhen little is needed, be little.\nAll things differ, yet all return to One.\n\nAll are governed by the **Dao**,\nRepaid with **virtue**—\nIf no one harbors deep malice,\nWhat cause for resentment remains?\n\nThe **Perfect Person’s** **Way** is vast,\nHis **primordial simplicity** minute,\nThough his actions are many,\nTheir essence is few.\nGreat and small contain the **Great Void** within a square inch,\nMuch and little encompass all things in **One Reality**,\nIn harmony with all things, all things become one with me—\nWhat is there to resent?\n\nThus it is said:\n**Great and small, much and little,**\n**Repay resentment with virtue.**\n\nAs for right and wrong, beauty and ugliness,\nResentment and anger, gratitude and **virtue**,\nAll arise from subtle beginnings,\nStart in ease, and end in difficulty,\nBegin in the fine, and culminate in the grand.\nIf one plans at the time of initial ease,\nThen at the end, there will be no difficulty.\nIf one acts at the time of first simplicity,\nThen afterward, it will surely be grand.\n\nThus, the world’s difficult tasks\nMust begin in what is easy,\nDesiring to act in ease\nTo plan for the weighty and great.\nThe world’s grandest deeds\nMust arise from the minute,\nDesiring to act in the minute\nTo remove it.\n\nOne’s own difficult task is **cultivating the True**,\nOne’s own grand task is **walking the **Way**.\nNothing is more difficult than **cultivating the True**,\nYet if one approaches it as if it were easy,\nOne’s resolve will be firm and unshaken—\nWhat difficulty remains?\nNothing is greater than **walking the **Way**,\nYet if one treats it as a minor matter,\nAnd persists without ceasing,\nAccumulating the fine to reach the grand—\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nThose who can be great must also be able to be small,\nThose who can be much must also be able to be little,\nThose who harbor resentment must repay with **virtue**,\nThose who plan for difficulty must first embrace ease,\nThose who achieve the great must first attend to the minute.\nFrom *\"Savor without savoring\"* onward,\nAll are metaphors.\nDifficult tasks must begin in ease,\nGreat deeds must arise from the minute—\nThis is merely elaborating the **Dao’s** intent.\n\n**Master Liu says:**\nSome say to Confucius:\n*\"You advocate repaying resentment with directness,\nYet now you say to repay it with **virtue**—why?\"*\nIndeed, **Laozi** teaches people\nTo dwell in gentleness and weakness,\nTo align with Heaven’s course,\nAnd to avoid contention—\nThus averting Heaven’s punishments\nAnd warding off human calamities.\nIf one repays resentment with directness,\nHow could resentment ever cease?\nAt that time, Confucius spoke in provocation,\nYet nothing surpasses repaying with **virtue** as good.\n\nThus the **Sage** never seeks to be great,\nAnd so can achieve the great.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nThe **Sage** does not act in what is difficult or grand,\nYet does nothing and attends to nothing,\nSimple and easy, simple and knowable—\nThus can he establish foundations that endure and grow grand.\nThe **Sage** cherishes **virtue** and **power**,\nKnows himself without revealing himself,\nLoves himself without esteeming himself,\nNever seeks to be great.\nWithin the square inch, in the realm of true nature,\nThere is nothing he does not forget,\nNothing he does not possess—\nSerene and boundless,\nYet all beauties follow him.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Therefore the **Sage** never seeks to be great,\nAnd so can achieve the great.\"*\n\n**Master Li says:**\nWhen the **Sage’s** deeds are fully realized,\nHe does not claim greatness himself—\nHeaven does not claim to be Heaven;\nWhat makes Heaven is things.\nThe **Sage** does not claim to be the **Sage**;\nWhat makes the **Sage** is the people.\nBecause he does not claim to be the **Sage**,\nHe can become the **Sage**.\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nThe **Sage** does not claim greatness yet remains humble and lowly—\nThus he achieves the great.\n\nHe who makes light promises will lack trust,\nHe who takes many things lightly will face many difficulties.\nThus the **Sage** still regards them as difficult,\nAnd so in the end faces no difficulty.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nHe who makes light promises lacks sincerity,\nAnd reckless responses will lead to deceit.\nHe who takes many things lightly is negligent in affairs,\nAnd reckless action will lead to difficulty.\nEven the **Sage’s** talents find difficulty in minute, easy matters,\nLet alone failing to dare act lightly in all things—\nThus, in the **Way**, he is diligent and perseveres,\nAnd in the end faces no difficulty.\n\nLight promises lead to few fulfillments,\nMany easy things lead to many difficulties—\nThus it is said that first embracing difficulty leads to attainment,\nFor difficulty and ease complement each other.\n\n**Master Li says:**\nDifficult tasks are easy to complete,\nEasy tasks are difficult to complete—\nEasy tasks must not be taken lightly,\nFor if they are, people will neglect them,\nThus the **Sage** still regards them as difficult.\nWhat is gained with difficulty is lost with difficulty—\nIf one does not act lightly in all things,\nThen in the end there will be no difficulty.\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nThose who make light promises often overcommit,\nAnd so must fail in trust.\nThose who treat matters with a careless heart\nOften fail to complete them—\nThis is also metaphorical language.\nBut by adding *\"the man who\"* [夫],\nThe meaning shifts again.\nEarlier, it was said *\"easy\"* [易],\nFor fear people would view it with a lighthearted attitude,\nThus turning it to say:\n*\"Easy\" is not \"light and easy\"—*\nThe **Sage** still treats it with a difficult mindset,\nAnd so reaches a state of no difficulty—\nLet alone others.\n\nThis intent means:\nWhen earlier it spoke of *\"easy,\"*\nIt referred to **non-action** and **non-affairs** being easy to practice,\nNot that *\"easy\"* means acting lightly.\n\n**Master He says:**\nEmpty promises bring real disaster—\nHe who makes light promises will lack trust indeed.\nWords spoken without reproach.\nMany easy things lead to many difficulties—\nThe **Sage**, dwelling in **non-action** and savoring **non-flavor**,\nPenetrating the **Way** beyond form,\nGives rise to **being** from **non-being**,\nAnd difficulty and ease complement each other.\nAdapting to things without being bound by them,\nYet able to flexibly complete all things without omission—\nThus it is said:\n*\"There is nothing he does not forget,\nNothing he does not possess.\"*\nThis reveals the **Sage’s** heart—\nNeither **being** nor **non-being**.\n\n**The Complete Compilation of the *Dao De Jing* (Volume Nine, *Xu Jiang Wei Da You* Collection) – Chapter 64**\n\nIts ease is easy to maintain,\nIts unseen signs are easy to plan against.\nIts fragility is easy to shatter,\nIts subtlety is easy to disperse.\n\nAct before things arise,\nSet things in order before they fall into disorder.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nThe ancient rulers of the world—\nWhen governing, they faced disorder as their counterpart,\nWhen securing peace, they faced peril as their counterpart.\nWhen the state was at peace, it was easy to maintain,\nBut when it leaned toward danger, it became difficult to defend.\nThus the *Book of Zhou* says:\n*\"Establish governance before disorder arises,\nPreserve the realm before danger manifests.\"*\nFor like a sprout not yet strong,\nIts fragility is easy to shatter,\nAnd remorse not yet settled,\nIts subtleties are easy to disperse.\n\nTake from oneself—\nIn the prime of youth, when the body is at ease,\nIt is easy to practice self-cultivation.\nThe rewards are seen swiftly,\nFor when sickness has not yet manifested,\nOne’s cultivation and refinement are easy to plan and achieve.\nBut when desires grow excessive,\nSpirit weakens and vital essence is depleted,\nOnce illness strikes, it flees like passing waves.\nIf nurturing is done properly,\nQi harmonious and spirit undisturbed,\nEven minor ailments are easy to treat.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Its ease is easy to maintain,\nIts unseen signs are easy to plan against,\nIts fragility is easy to shatter,\nIts subtlety is easy to disperse.\"*\nMoreover, the person yet to fall ill\nIs easy to heal,\nThe state yet to face danger\nIs easy to strategize for.\nIf one prepares defenses beforehand,\nThen disasters not yet formed—\nHow could they take root?\nIf one makes plans in advance,\nThen troubles not yet visible—\nHow could they arise?\n\nTherefore, the **Sage** does not fear many difficulties,\nBut fears the absence of difficulty.\nFor calamity and fortune are inherently intertwined—\nIf one attends to their latent origins,\nCalamity may turn into fortune.\nBut if one neglects them once they manifest,\nFortune may shift into calamity—\nBeyond remedy.\n\nThus, the **Dao** of regulating the body and harmonizing the heart\nIs to preemptively guard against emotions and desires,\nTo balance and adapt the spirit and qi,\nAnd prevent them from falling into disorder.\n\n**Master Li says:**\nReferring to the meaning of the previous chapter,\n*\"Its ease is easy to maintain\"*—\nWhen undertaking deeds, the sincere seeker of **True Dao** (*Xiu Zhen Zhi Shi*)\nRectifies the heart before thoughts arise,\nAnd restrains emotions before they are provoked by external things.\nThen the heart is easily corrected,\nAnd emotions easily severed.\nBut if one governs affairs after they have fallen into disorder,\nAnd wards off disasters after they have already sprouted—\nIs that not difficult?\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nWhen peace prevails,\nMaintaining it is easy.\nBut once danger arises,\nIt becomes difficult to hold firm.\nWhen troubles are yet unseen,\nPlanning against them is clear and easy.\nBut once they take form,\nThey become hard to counter.\nFragile yet not yet strong—\nAttack it, and it is easy to shatter.\nBut once it grows firm,\nIt is hard to attack.\nThus, one must act before things arise,\nAnd govern before they fall into disorder.\n\nA tree thick enough to embrace,\nGrows from a tiny sprout.\nA nine-tiered tower,\nRises from a single basket of soil.\nA journey of a thousand miles,\nBegins with a single step.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nIf one does not preemptively guard against troubles,\nNor block evil at its roots,\nIt is like planting a tree.\nWhen it first sprouts,\nOne may uproot and sever it—\nHow easy!\nBut once it reaches a thickness of a hundred feet,\nHow can one cut it down?\n\nAgain, if one builds a tower,\nStarting with a single basket of soil,\nOne may kick it into place—\nHow difficult could that be?\nBut once it rises to nine tiers,\nTowering a hundred feet high,\nHow can one demolish it?\n\nAgain, if one embarks on a distant journey,\nBeginning with a single step,\nOne may turn back at once.\nBut once it stretches a thousand miles,\nEndless and vast,\nHow can one return?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"A tree thick enough to embrace,\nGrows from a tiny sprout.\nA nine-tiered tower,\nRises from a single basket of soil.\nA journey of a thousand miles,\nBegins with a single step.\"*\n\n**Master Li says:**\nSmall things accumulate into greatness—\nBeyond remedy.\nThus the *Yijing* warns:\n*\"Treading on frost, expect solid ice.\"*\nThe commentary states:\n*\"A subject slays his ruler,\nA son slays his father—\nThis is not the work of a single morning or evening.\nTheir origins lie in gradual corruption,\nFrom failing to discern early.\"* (*Yi Bian Zhi Bu Zao Ye*)\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nA tree thick enough to embrace,\nIts growth must begin from a sprout.\nA nine-tiered tower,\nIts construction must start from a single basket of soil.\nA journey of a thousand miles,\nMust begin with the first step.\nAll these examples\nSpeak to the **Dao**-seeker’s need to understand the critical moment (*ji*).\n\nHe who acts will fail,\nHe who grasps will lose.\nThus the **Sage** practices **non-action** and avoids failure,\nLets go and avoids loss.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nIf one acts out of differentiation,\nOne disrupts **nature’s** spontaneity.\nIf one clings to desires and gains,\nOne loses **spirit’s** essence.\nBetter to rest in what is at ease,\nAnd guard what is naturally held—\nThen one governs without knowing one governs,\nActs without seeing one acts.\n\nThe **Sage** perceives where things fail—\nFrom having acted.\nIf one does not act, how could there be failure?\nWhere intentions falter—\nFrom having grasped.\nIf one does not grasp, how could there be loss?\n\nIf one governs the body through action,\nThen form is strained and spirit taxed,\nMind and soul grow weary.\nIf one clings to things,\nThen one becomes fixated in one corner,\nNever departing from the myriad attachments,\nFar from the **Way**.\n\nThe **Sage** has never acted nor grasped—\nPure and unadulterated **True Dao** (*Zhen Zhen*).\nThus, enduring ten thousand kalpas without failure,\nNo form to grasp—\nHow could there be loss?\n\n**Master He says:**\nThe **Sage**, when undertaking deeds, attends to their beginnings,\nAnd ensures both good beginnings and endings.\nHe never dares to act lightly,\nNor cling to what he sees.\nFor he harbors the subtle and profound,\nEmbraces simplicity and purity,\nAnd does not dare stir up the contentious hearts of the world.\nHe follows **principle** (*li*) in his actions—\nWhat does he do?\nHe aligns with the times in his deeds—\nWhat does he grasp?\nNames follow their own destinies,\nAffairs unfold naturally—\nHow could he fail or lose?\n\nThe people, when they act,\nOften falter just as things are nearing completion.\nIf one is cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nThen there will be no failed affairs.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nThough the world strives for good deeds,\nNone lack a beginning,\nFew achieve an end.\nAll grow weary from the start,\nBegin with joy but end in weariness,\nNear completion yet then collapse—\nThis is because their resolve is not steadfast,\nAnd thus **True Dao** does not solidify.\nVital essence leaks away,\nHence it is said:\n*\"Qi depletion, essence leakage—\nThis is not one’s own form.\"*\n\nThe **True Person** (*Zhìrén*) acts with undivided resolve,\nFrom beginning to end, unchanging—\nAll spirits align of their own accord,\nWho could bring him to ruin?\n\n**Master He says:**\nCommon folk who seek to act\nDeem diligence as incompetence,\nThose who cling to rigidity\nSee adaptability as unprincipled.\nThus their affairs fail when nearly complete—\nThis warns against failing to *palindromically* (*shènzhōng-rúshǐ*) persevere,\nLest one begin with vigor but end in few achievements.\n\nHence the Sage\nDesires without desiring,\nDoes not prize hard-to-obtain wealth,\nLearns without learning,\nCorrects the errors of the multitude,\nTo aid the natural unfolding of all things,\nYet dares not act.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nThe True Person is not without desire—\nHe desires what others do not,\nDoes not trade his nature for things,\nSo what need has he for rare treasures?\nHe is not without learning—\nHe learns what others do not,\nDoes not take deception as his mind.\nAll that the multitude errs in,\nHe returns to correct—\nThus it is said:\nThe Sage desires without desiring,\nDoes not prize hard-to-obtain wealth,\nLearns without learning,\nCorrects the multitude’s errors,\nTo reach the point of neither aiding life\nNor prolonging it,\nFollowing things in their natural course,\nWith no room for private interference.\n\nThe **Dao** can be a parent,\n**Virtue** (*dé*) a friend—\nWith **Dao** and **virtue** supporting his form,\nIn every matter, he acts spontaneously—\nHow could he dare to contrive?\n\n**Master Wu says:**\nThe Sage’s desire is to *not desire* as desire,\nHis learning is to *not learn* as learning.\nHard-to-obtain wealth—\nWhat others desire, he does not prize—\nThis is to not desire what is desirable,\nHence it is said: *\"Desire not-desire.\"*\nWhat the multitude pursues, he does not pursue;\nWhat the multitude dismisses with a shrug, he returns to—\nThis is to not learn what others learn,\nHence it is said: *\"Learn not-learning.\"*\nAll these—*not desiring, not learning*—\nAre because the **principle** (*lǐ*) of all things\nIs to act without action, naturally.\nThus I too act without action,\nIn harmony with all things, as spokes unite in a wheel.\n\n**Master He says:**\nThis chapter first speaks of acting before action,\nThen of those who act failing at completion,\nAnd finally of daring not to act.\nSo is acting correct, or not acting?\nBoth are correct—\nIs it not said:\n*\"Act without action,\nAnd nothing remains ungoverned.\"*\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nWhat the multitude does not desire, the Sage desires;\nWhat the multitude prizes, the Sage does not prize—\nThis is metaphorical speech.\nWhat the multitude does not learn, the Sage learns;\nWhat the multitude passes by without a glance, the Sage turns back to—\n*Return* (*fǔ*) is also metaphorical speech.\nThe Sage, thus acting in all things,\nHolds a heart of *daring not to act*,\nOnly then can he aid the natural unfolding of all things.\n\n---\n**Chapter 65**\nThe ancients who excelled in the **Dao**\nDid not enlighten the people—\nThey sought to make them simple.\nThe people are hard to govern\nBecause their cleverness is excessive.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nIn ancient times, those who governed well\nGathered the people with **Dao**,\nOpened their innate nature to the heavens,\nRectified their hearts and sincerely their intentions,\nSeeking to guide the people to simplicity,\nTheir **virtue** and bearing overflowing,\nAll day like the unknowing,\nSo the people followed them their whole lives\nWithout knowing why.\nThose who govern well with **Dao**\nDo not display their brilliance to dazzle the vulgar,\nIn harmony with the unknowing,\nEmbracing simplicity alone.\n\n**Master Wu says:**\nIn the ancient times, they governed without action,\nThe people were pure and unknowing.\nIn later times, they governed with action,\nThe people became artful and deceitful—\nHence their difficulty in governance.\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nCleverness is a burden to the **Dao**.\nThe Sage’s teaching of others\nAlways seeks to obscure their cleverness,\nLest they burden themselves—\nHence it is said:\n*\"Not to enlighten the people,\nBut to make them simple.\"*\nThe more cunning and skillful the people,\nThe harder they are to govern—\nThus governing with cleverness\nBecomes the ruin of the state.\nNot governing with cleverness\nIs the state’s blessing.\nKnow these two principles—\nThis is called **Mysterious Virtue** (*Xuándé*).\n**Mysterious Virtue** is profound and distant,\nOpposed to things—\nOnly then does one reach **Great Harmony** (*Dàshùn*).\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nGoverning with cleverness\nBecomes the ruin of the state—\nFor if superiors and inferiors all rely on cunning,\nChaos ensues, and treacherous ministers and rebellious sons\nSeize power and rely on strength—\nWhat more could there be?\nThis is not called governing with cleverness—what is?\nIf one governs the self with cleverness,\nThe spirits grow unsettled—\nHow could one not steal one’s **true qi**?\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nIf the cleverness of bows, crossbows, and snares increases,\nBirds grow disordered above.\nIf the cleverness of hooks, bait, and nets increases,\nFish grow disordered in the water.\nIf the cleverness of deceit, poison, and sophistic arguments—\nDistinctions of *precedence, slipperiness, hardness, whiteness, impurity, sameness, and difference*—increases,\nThe vulgar are bewildered by debate.\nIf superiors govern with cleverness,\nThen inferiors respond in kind—\nThus superiors and inferiors become entangled in chaos,\nAnd treacherous ministers and rebellious sons\nSeize power and rely on strength—\nWhat more could there be?\nThis is not called governing with cleverness—what is?\nMoreover, in ancient times,\nThose who ruled nations\nUsed knots and markings on the ground—\nTheir governance was subtle,\nTheir people pure—\nWithout governance, they governed themselves,\nThus opening the people’s **innate nature** (*tiān*),\nYet still not as opening the **Heaven’s nature** (*tiān*).\nThis is not called not governing with cleverness—what is?\nIf one governs the self with cleverness,\nThe spirits grow unsettled—\nHow could one not steal one’s **true qi**?\n\n---\n\nBorn without relying on cleverness,\nThis is called nourishing tranquility with cleverness.\n\nWhen cleverness and tranquility mutually nourish each other,\nThen the myriad spirits become balanced and harmonious,\nAnd the ten thousand *qi* all blend in unity—\nWho, if not those who forget the form and embrace the Dao,\nCould attain this?\n\nThus it is said:\nTo govern a nation with cleverness is to ruin it,\nTo govern without cleverness is to bless it.\nFor those who employ cleverness corrupt governance and harm the people,\nWhile those who do not employ cleverness cultivate governance and nourish the people—\nThese are the models and standards by which to measure.\n\nHaving known these models yet still not using cleverness,\nTo bring this people to wealth and longevity,\nFollowing Heaven’s principles,\nAnd aligning with Heaven’s virtue—\nThis is called knowing these two models.\n\nTo always know these models\nIs called the **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\nThe **Mysterious Virtue** is profound beyond measure,\nDistant beyond sight,\nSo subtle and refined that it cannot be detected.\nYet observe its application—it seems contrary to things,\nBut examine its principle—it converges with the same end as things,\nEntering the realm of natural spontaneity without resistance.\n\nThe **Perfect One** stands in opposition to the world and its myriad affairs,\nYet returns to simplicity and purity,\nAligning with the Great Harmony—\nGreat Harmony means no obstruction.\nThus it is said:\nThe **Mysterious Virtue** is profound and distant,\nContrary to things,\nOnly then does it reach the **Great Harmony**—\nThe ultimate harmony.\n\n○ **Master He** says:\nThe Sage does not govern cleverness with cleverness,\nNor does He wander with the world in the realm of contrivances and schemes,\nBut governs cleverness with simplicity,\nDrawing it back to the Dao of ease and straightforwardness—\nHow could this not be so?\nThus it is said: *The Sage*.\n\nIf cleverness exists without the Dao,\nThen the world falls into great chaos.\nHow do we know this is so?\nWhen the cleverness of bows, crossbows, and snares abounds,\nThen birds are disturbed in the sky.\nWhen the cleverness of nets, traps, and hooks abounds,\nThen fish are disturbed in the water.\nWhen the cleverness of deceit, poison, and sophistry—\nThe debates of *jié* and *huá*, the distinctions of firm and white,\nThe arguments of impurity and purity, of same and different—abounds,\nThen people are bewildered by discourse.\nThus the world often falls into great chaos,\nAnd the fault lies in the love of cleverness—\nThis has been so since the Three Dynasties.\n\nTo govern a nation with cleverness is to harm the people,\nTo govern without cleverness is to bless them.\nTo know these two models is also a standard—\nThis is the fine law for those who rule.\nTo always uphold this fine law,\nThen the virtue becomes profound, deep, and distant.\n\nThus it is said:\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast, their transformation is uniform,\nThough myriad things abound, their governance is one,\nThough the people are countless, their ruler is singular.\nThe ruler originates from virtue and is completed by Heaven—\nThus it is said:\nThe ancient Sage who ruled the world did so with *wuwei*,\nFor his virtue was that of Heaven itself.\n\nTo stand contrary to things—\nThey rely on their cleverness,\nI rely on the **Mysterious Virtue**,\nThey rely on harm,\nI rely on blessing—\nOpposite yet never conflicting.\nStraight speech as if reversed,\nThis is the **Great Harmony**—\nThe ultimate harmony.\nHow could it lie in private scheming or cleverness,\nIn clashing with things like blades,\nAnd yet be unable to stop?\n\n○ **Master Li** says:\n*Wuwei* is broad and generous,\nBringing peace to the world—\nThis is the people’s blessing.\n*Youwei* is meticulous and strict,\nDominating the people—\nThis is the nation’s ruin.\nThe difficulty in governing the people lies in their many affairs,\nThus the Sage governs the nation with *wuwei* and tranquility,\nSo that the clever may dare not act.\nThough contrary to things,\nThis reversal penetrates natural spontaneity—\nThe people follow their nature,\nReaping a hundredfold blessings,\nThe world attains peace,\nAnd the **Great Harmony** is fulfilled.\nTo exhaust this Dao is to embody the **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six**\nThe reason the rivers and seas can be kings of the myriad valleys\nIs that they excel in humility.\nThus they become kings of the myriad valleys.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says:\nThe rivers and seas reign over the myriad valleys\nThrough humility and lowliness,\nThrough emptiness and receptivity,\nThrough *wuwei* and seeking nothing—\nAnd the hundred rivers naturally flow to them.\nFrom this, we see that humility as Dao is great indeed.\nIn the human body, the lower *dantian* at the navel is the *qihai* (Sea of Qi),\nThe origin of the five *zàng* and six *fǔ*’s vital breath,\nThe source of the thirteen thousand five hundred breaths,\nThe ancestor of the twelve meridians.\nIf one diligently guards the *qihai* without interruption,\nThen the *qi* of the hundred passes naturally converges there.\n\n○ **Master He** says:\nThe rivers and seas do not resist the smallest streams,\nThus they achieve their greatness,\nNaturally embodying the majesty of ruling the myriad valleys—\nYet this greatness is not forced.\nWater has no division of east and west,\nOnly division of high and low.\nThe sea resides below, and thus the myriad valleys naturally pay homage.\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the seas.\"*\nWhat Dao is this?\nThe Sage-King knows to embrace the yielding to guard the strong.\n\n○ **Master Lin** says:\nThe waters of the myriad valleys all flow to the rivers and seas,\nAnd though the rivers and seas are the exalted kings of the valleys,\nThey yet reside below the myriad valleys—\nThis is a metaphor borrowed from things,\nExpressing the intent of humbling oneself to be exalted by others.\nThus the Sage, desiring to rise above others,\nMust first speak in humility.\nDesiring to lead others,\nMust first place himself behind them.\n\n「Thus, when the Sage stands above the people, they do not feel burdened;\nWhen he leads before them, they do not feel harmed.\nHence, his virtue is pushed forward without ever being exhausted.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says:\nThe Sage embodies the Way of humility and yielding,\nAnd though he desires to stand above others,\nHe must first humble his words to them,\nFor he knows that arrogance invites loss.\nThus, his speech is modest and gentle,\nHis reputation is one of solitude and simplicity,\nAnd by yielding to all things,\nHis virtue grows ever more exalted,\nHis great treasure ever more secure—\nNaturally, others push him forward,\nAnd he comes to stand above them.\nWhen he wishes to lead all things,\nHe must first humble himself in speech and retreat in body,\nPlacing himself behind others.\nFor he carefully follows the Dao,\nNever forcing himself before others,\nThus, he is pushed forward by all things\nAnd comes to lead them.\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"When the Sage desires to stand above others,\nHe must first humble his words to them.\nWhen he desires to lead others,\nHe must first place himself behind them.\nThus, he stands above others without burdening them—\nAnd they follow him lightly.\nHe leads before others without harming them—\nAnd they benefit greatly from him.\nNot burdening, so not slighted;\nNot harming, so not resisted.\nBenefit and harm, lightness and burden—\nThese arise naturally.\nHow could there be room for scheming in his heart?\nThus, the world willingly embraces the Yellow Emperor’s\nClear and tranquil transformation,\nAnd never tires of it—\nFor his humble and lowly virtue reaches far,\nAnd the world joyfully pushes him forward without exhaustion.\nThe learned and noble naturally revere him,\nStanding above others, leading them,\nHis brilliance concealed yet exalted—\nA result of his virtue.\nWhat exhaustion could there be?\"*\n\n○ **Master He** says:\nThe Sage’s heart is like the boundless void,\nHis Dao like the heavens and earth—\nHe awaits the world with gentle stillness.\nWhat desires could he have?\nTo stand above others, to lead them—\nHe shows them what is worthy of imitation,\nSpeaking in accord with their nature.\nWhat scheming could the Sage have?\n\nPeople all seek blessings,\nYet he alone remains complete and unassuming—\nThus, when he stands above the people,\nThey do not feel burdened,\nAnd those who press themselves below\nAre exalted by others.\nPeople all seek substance,\nYet he alone embraces emptiness—\nThus, when he leads before them,\nThey do not feel harmed,\nAnd those who injure themselves by rushing forward\nAre led by others.\n\nHe entrusts the small to contain the great,\nHis resolve weak yet his actions strong,\nEver wide and accommodating toward all things,\nNever diminished by others.\nWhat others naturally dislike and resent\nBecomes their joyful endorsement—\nNo longer weary of his teaching.\n\n○ **Master Wu** says:\n*\"To humble his words\"* means to lower and bend his speech,\nNot to exalt it.\n*\"To place himself behind\"* means to retreat his body,\nNot to advance it.\nYet these are all the Sage’s supreme virtues of modesty and yielding—\nNot that he harbors any intent to stand above or lead others.\nThe reader must not let the words obscure the meaning.\n\n○ **Master Lin** says:\nThe Sage does not first desire to stand above or lead others\nAnd then act accordingly.\nHis intent is simply this:\nEven the Sage, though he desires to stand above or lead others,\nStill acts in this way—\nHow much more so others!\nBecause he does not contend,\nThe world cannot contend with him.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says:\nThe Sage always treats his body as empty,\nHis heart as non-being.\nOnce his mind and form are settled,\nWho could contend with him?\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"You alone do not boast,\nAnd thus none can contend with your ability.\nYou alone do not vaunt yourself,\nAnd thus none can contend with your achievements.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nThe Perfect One forgets his ears and eyes,\nDiscards his liver and gall,\nDissolves all attachments,\nErases all distinctions of self and world,\nHarmonizes with the natural course,\nAnd flows with all things—\nWho then could contend with him?\n\n○ **Master He** says:\nHuman hearts and the principles of the Dao\nCan be moved by the Way, not by force.\nBecause he does not contend,\nThe world cannot contend with him.\nWhat he upholds is sparse,\nYet those who submit to him are many—\nThis is the natural order.\n\nLaozi once spoke to Wenzi:\n*\"The Sage who desires to be honored by others\nMust first honor others.\nThe Sage who desires to humble others\nMust first humble himself.\"*\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven**\nAll under heaven say I am great—\nYet I seem unworthy.\nOnly because I am great\nDo I seem unworthy.\nIf I were worthy,\nLong ago I would have been insignificant.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says:\nThe Dao is vast and formless, nameless,\nFilling all things.\nThough it exists, it seems as if it does not—\nIts likeness to all things is nonexistent.\nThis is why it is great.\nIf it were to resemble any thing,\nThe Dao would itself be a thing—\nAnd how could it then be great?\n\n○ **Master Dong** says:\nIf it resembles anything,\nIt would be identical to one thing—\nHow could it then be great?\n\n○ **Master He** says:\nThe Sage holds himself in profound virtue,\nNot desiring to be seen as honored in the world.\nThus, the world regards him as boundlessly great,\nWithout resemblance to anything.\n\nOnly the great are indistinct and obscure—\nNo one can name them.\nIf they resemble anything,\nThey are merely petty in conduct.\n\n○ **Master Lin** says:\nOne manuscript adds *\"the Dao\"* after *\"I\"* and *\"also\"* after *\"insignificant\"*—\nBoth are errors.\n\nI have three treasures, which I hold fast.\nThe first is *compassion*,\nThe second is *frugality*,\nThe third is *not daring to lead the world*.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says:\nIf a person embraces the Dao and governs himself\nAs one would hold a treasure,\nHe must surely cherish and guard it without loss.\nThe three practices he follows are:\nTo embody benevolence and widely bestow kindness,\nNurturing all living beings—this is *compassion*.\nTo use resources moderately and enrich others,\nNot exhausting what belongs to all—this is *frugality*.\nTo never initiate action,\nHarmonizing without instigating,\nDaring not to lead—this is *not daring to lead*.\n\nThe Perfect One who preserves these three treasures\nExtends broad relief to all suffering,\nClothes and shelters all things—\nThis is the utmost of *compassion*.\nFrugality in hearing and seeing preserves the spirit from agitation,\nFrugality in speech preserves the *qi* from depletion,\nFrugality in desires preserves the heart from disturbance—\nThis is the supreme treasure for nourishing life.\nAble to place himself behind others,\nHis humility naturally elevates him—\nThus it is said:\n*\"I have three treasures, which I hold fast—\nThe first is compassion,\nThe second is frugality,\nThe third is not daring to lead the world.\"*\n\n○ **Master He** says:\nThe Sage does not regard jade and pearls as treasures,\nBut treasures only the Dao—\nWhich Dao?\nThe Dao of *compassion, frugality,* and *not daring to lead*.»\n\n「A common man brandishing his sword and glaring fiercely—\nThis is the way of one who delights in bravery,\nThe *qi* of petty men seeking self-aggrandizement,\nYet I treasure *compassion* as my jewel.\n\nTo barricade one’s door with small vessels and fill it with wealth—\nThis is the way of one who delights in abundance,\nThe shallow vision of petty men in their self-indulgence,\nYet I treasure frugality as my jewel.\n\nTo pursue fame and gain, to vie with others—\nThis is the way of one who delights in leading,\nThe boastful arrogance of petty men calling it skill,\nYet I treasure *not daring to lead* as my jewel.»\n\n○ **Master Wu** says:\n*\"Preserve\"* means to hold fast without loss,\n*Compassion* means gentle kindness, mercy without rigidity,\nFrugality means moderation in small matters, restraint without excess,\n*Not daring to lead* means humility and retreat without reckless advance—\nThus, though great, he seems not to excel.\nFor *compassion* is why he can be brave,\nFrugality is why he can be expansive,\n*Not daring to lead* is why he can be a master of affairs.\n\nNow if one abandons *compassion* for mere bravery,\nAbandons frugality for mere expansiveness,\nAbandons humility for mere advancement—\nThen death is certain!\n\n○ **Master Lü** says:\nTo know humility and gentleness as superior to rigidity,\nTo follow the natural order of sentient beings—this is *compassion*—\nThus one may speak of bravery.\nTo know moderation and frugality as noble,\nTo use them without depletion—this is frugality—\nThus one may speak of expansiveness.\nTo know placing others before oneself as the way to restrain oneself and return to propriety,\nTo give only to the virtuous—\nThus one may become a master of affairs.\n\nFor rigidity is easily broken,\nBut *compassion* and gentleness are invincible.\n*Compassion* is bravery without rigidity,\nFrugality cherishes vital *qi* and essence,\nPreserving spirit and clarity without exhaustion,\nThus my Dao grows ever broader.\nI never lead others,\nSo my virtue is joyfully extended without end,\nAnd I become the sovereign of the Dao’s instruments.\nThus it is said:\n*Compassion* is why he can be brave,\nFrugality is why he can be expansive,\n*Not daring to lead* is why he can be a master of affairs.\n\nYet the world today does otherwise:\nThey discard *compassion* and virtue,\nPursuing mere bravery and righteousness,\nDraining their *qi* and risking their lives,\nUnable to preserve frugality in their use,\nExalting luxury and excess,\nWasting resources and harming the people,\nOnly to invite ruin and scarcity,\nLacking the heart for humility and retreat,\nYet harboring the will for rigidity and strength,\nDelighting in taking the lead,\nShaming to follow others—\nThese are not the arts of longevity and greatness,\nBut tools for self-destruction.\n\nThus it is said:\nNow if one abandons *compassion* for mere bravery,\nAbandons frugality for mere expansiveness,\nAbandons humility for mere advancement—\nThen death is certain!\n\n○ **Master Lin** says:\n*\"Instrument\"* is form,\nTo *\"become a master of affairs\"* is to *\"take form\"*—\nAll things that take form upon the earth,\nI make them my masters.\nThus it is said: *\"become a master of affairs.\"*\n\nNow people discard *compassion* and use only their bravery,\nDiscard frugality and use only their expansiveness,\nDiscard humility and use only advancement—\nThis is not the way to preserve life,\nThus it is said: *\"Then death is certain!\"*\n\n○ **Master Wu** says:\n*\"Abandon\"* means to not use.\nTo not use the treasures of *compassion*, frugality, humility, and retreat,\nTo employ rigidity as bravery,\nExcess as expansiveness,\nReckless advance as leadership—\nThen one will not be able to preserve life,\nBut will become a follower of death.\n\nFor *compassion* in war brings victory,\nIn defense brings security.\nWhen Heaven intends to aid him,\nIt shields him with *compassion.*\n\n○ **Master Lü** says:\nEven *compassionate* armies entering enemy lands\nAre seen as protectors by the people,\nSpared the crops and graves,\nNot plundered nor burned—\nThus all rejoice in them.\nWhy must one array soldiers to fight,\nAnd only then achieve victory?\nHeavily barred doors and nightly guards\nAre the ways of defense and security.\n\nThus the Dao of Heaven rewards the virtuous and punishes the licentious,\nThe virtuous are naturally shielded by Heaven,\nTheir hearts and wills opened,\nSo they may be *compassionate* toward all things,\nAnd when *compassionate* toward all things,\nThe world protects them.\nThe Perfect One can defend *compassionate* bravery against the world’s entanglements,\nThen no thousand demons dare approach,\nAnd his Dao grows ever more secure.\nFor Heaven’s Dao knows no favorites,\nIt always aligns with the virtuous.\nThus it is said:\n*Compassion* in war brings victory,\nIn defense brings security,\nWhen Heaven intends to aid him,\nIt shields him with *compassion.*\n\n○ **Master Lin** says:\n*\"War\"* is interaction with things that stir the heart,\nJust as *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"To engage with others is to clash—\nDaily, the heart struggles within itself.\"*\n*\"Defense\"* is like *Zhuangzi*’s *\"preserving pure* qi*\"—\nIf a man takes *compassion* as his master,\nThen externally he can conquer things,\nInternally he can preserve himself.\nThe earlier words on the three treasures,\nHere I expound upon one—\nTo be *compassionate* is to embrace the other two within.\n\n○ **Master Wu** says:\n*Compassion* is the Dao of life,\nThe virtue of *ren*,\nThe foremost of the three treasures,\nThus below this, I speak solely of *compassion*—\nThe other two treasures are contained within it.\n\n*Compassion* is what all men naturally love,\nLike a father and mother—\nWho would have a son who opposes his parents,\nWho attacks his parents?\n\nThus, to wage war with *compassion*\nIs to make men unwilling to resist—\nThis is true victory.\nTo defend with *compassion*\nIs to make men unwilling to assault—\nThis is true security.\n\nEven if there are raiders who come to attack or plunder,\nThose who aid their parents are many,\nAnd so they will surely be victorious and secure.\nOr if human strength is insufficient,\nHeaven will also aid and rescue them,\nNot allowing them to be defeated and scattered.\nHeaven’s aid comes because they are able to be *compassionate* and rescue others.\n\n○ **Master Li** says:\nThe single character *compassion*\nIn war brings victory,\nIn defense brings security—\n*Ren* is invincible,\nThis is true bravery.\n\n**Chapter 68:**\nThe good *scholar-official* does not rely on force,\nThe good warrior does not grow angry,\nThe good victor does not quarrel,\nThe good user of men places them below himself.\n\n○ **Master He** says:\nGongyi Bo was renowned for his strength among the feudal lords,\nKing Xuan of Zhou invited him with elaborate rites to inquire of his prowess,\nObserving his frail appearance.\nThe king asked: *\"How is your strength?\"*\nGongyi Bo replied: *\"My strength can break the leg of a spring grasshopper,\nSever the wings of an autumn cicada.\"*\nThe king said: *\"My strength can split the hide of a rhinoceros,\nDrag the tail of an oxen of nine thousand pounds—\nYet I still find you weak.\nIf your strength is renowned throughout the world, what is it for?\"*\nGongyi Bo replied: *\"Noble is your question, my lord!\nMy teacher, Shangqiuzi, had strength without rival in the world,\nYet even his six relations did not know of it—\nBecause he never used his strength.\nNow my name is known to the feudal lords,\nThis means I have gone against my teacher’s instructions,\nAnd displayed my own abilities.\nYet my fame does not come from my strength itself,\nBut from my ability to use my strength wisely.\"*\n\n「Thus, the skillful in serving as the lower party are not aggressive—\nThis principle is clearly demonstrated in practice.\nIn *Zhuangzi*: the Market-South Comilou played with balls,\nYet the two families’ feud remained unresolved;\nSun Shu’ao lay content with his jade staff and feathered fan,\nYet the people of Ying cast down their weapons.\nThese are those who do not rage yet excel in battle,\nWho do not contend yet triumph in victory.\n\nHan Xin untied Guangwu Jun’s bonds,\nFacing east to acknowledge him as a teacher,\nSeeking strategies for Yan and Qi—\nThis is the skillful use of others as the lower party.\n\nThe ancient adept at being a warrior,\nDid not seek to be fierce and strong;\nIn battle, he did not yield to anger or rage,\nYet victory over the enemy came without clashing strength—\nFor the Dao/Way was preserved within him.\nThus, some say, *\"I excel in forming arrays!\"*\n*\"I excel in waging war!\"*—\nThis is a grave offense.\n\nWhen a sovereign cherishes virtue/power of benevolence,\nThe world finds no rival.\n\n○ The Wu School says: In ancient times, chariot warfare was practiced,\nWhere a warrior (*shi*) meant three armored soldiers on a chariot—\nThe left wielded the bow, the right the spear,\nThe central one drove the chariot, controlling the flags and drums,\nAll desired to be strong and aggressive in battle.\nSeventy-two foot soldiers served beneath the chariot,\nAnd when war was imminent, their courage was roused,\nTheir will to contend with the enemy sharpened,\nSo they might take victory.\n\nBut the benevolent way of wielding armies\nDoes not regard this as skillful.\n\nWarriors do not wish to be strong and aggressive,\nIn battle, they do not seek to overwhelm with rage—\nVictory over the enemy does not depend on matching strength,\nWeapons are not drawn—\nThe enemy will yield themselves.\nThis is the wisdom and ability of the ancients.\n\n○ The Lin School says: The excellence of these four lies\nIn the art of non-contention.\nThis is called the virtue/power of non-contention,\nThis is called the strength of using others,\nThis is called the harmony with Heaven’s ancient principle.\nThe He School says: The virtue/power of non-contention\nIs benevolence without reliance on force.\nThe strength of using others\nIs bending collective strategy to collective force.\nHarmony with Heaven’s ancient principle\nIs that Heaven’s Dao/Way does not contend yet excels in victory,\nAnd has endured since antiquity—\nThe Way reaches its utmost.\n\n○ The Lin School says: Because of its virtue/power of non-contention,\nIt can harmonize with Heaven,\nIt can bend collective force,\nAnd govern the world—\nSince antiquity, none have surpassed it.\nThus it is called the ancient principle.\n\n○ The Li School says: The virtue/power of non-contention,\nThe strength of using others,\nBoth are rooted in benevolence and mercy—\nThus it is called harmony with Heaven.\nBy cultivating oneself thus,\nOne’s form is preserved and life prolonged.\n\n○ The Chai School says: Only by aligning with the Dao/Way\nOf the ancient sages can one stand at Heaven’s utmost—\nThus it is called harmony with Heaven’s ancient principle.\n\n**Chapter 69: On Wielding Armies, there is a saying:**\n*\"I dare not act as the aggressor, but only as the respondent.\nI dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot.\"*\n\nThe He School says: *\"I dare not act as the aggressor, but only as the respondent\"*\nIs what is called *responding armies*—\nThus, *\"relieving chaos and punishing tyranny\"* is called *righteous armies*,\nAnd armies of righteousness are invincible.\nWhen one rises not by choice but necessity,\nThis is called *responding armies*—\nAnd armies that respond will prevail.\n\nTo fight over petty grievances,\nTo bear grudges and refuse to yield in anger—\nThis is called *armies of resentment*—\nAnd armies of resentment will be defeated.\n\nTo covet another’s land and treasures—\nThis is called *greedy armies*—\nAnd greedy armies will be broken.\n\nTo rely on the might of one’s state,\nTo boast of the multitude of one’s people,\nAnd to wish to intimidate the enemy—\nThis is called *proud armies*—\nAnd proud armies will perish.\n\nThese five principles Laozi once spoke to Wenzhongzi,\nNow he says: *\"I dare not act as the aggressor, but only as the respondent\"*\nMeans the aggressor strikes first,\nWhile the respondent answers afterward—\nNot by choice.\n\n*\"I dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot\"*\nMeans to advance when opportunity is seen,\nTo retreat when difficulty is known—\nThe utmost of caution,\nYet not cowardice.\nTo fear in battle yet succeed through careful planning.\n\n○ The Lü School says: Those who spoke of military strategy in antiquity\nMust have regarded the aggressor as the first to act,\nAnd the respondent as the second to answer.\nThe aggressor creates the situation,\nThe respondent counters the enemy.\n\nMoreover, the Sage’s armies are deep in strategy, subtle in deployment—\nThough enemies come, we sit and watch their movements,\nAdapting as they change,\nPressing only when forced,\nRising only when necessity demands.\nIf one acts lightly, this is called *reckless with the enemy*.\n\nGenerally, those who have intent to contend\nMay not necessarily win,\nWhile those without intent to contend\nMay not necessarily lose—\nStrategy and timing depend on circumstances.\n\nThe Perfect One responds to the world,\nWith one glance, one listening,\nOne word, one smile—\nA thousand threads of interaction,\nAll called *magical illusions*.\n\nThe resolution of victory in battle\nLies in not daring to act as the aggressor first,\nBut maintaining a posture as the respondent,\nEver dwelling in stillness and composure,\nWith spirit unshaken—\nAdvancing an inch means meeting resistance,\nRetreating a foot means avoiding contention.\nHence the saying: *\"On wielding armies, there is a saying:\nI dare not act as the aggressor, but only as the respondent,\nI dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot.\"*\n\nThus, in movement there is no formation,\nIn repelling there are no arms,\nIn drawing there are no enemies,\nIn grasping there are no soldiers.\n\nThe He School says: The usual state of armies is\nMovement has formation,\nRepelling has arms,\nDrawing has enemies to face,\nGrasping has soldiers to hold—\nYet here all are absent,\nAs though without hands to strike or fists to raise,\nAs though the enemy passes by like a teacher on a pillow or bed,\nBending without battle—\nThis is why it is so.\n\n*Eran* (扔), means to draw or lure—\nAs in repelling with arms yet *eraning* them to lure,\n*Eran* and *cai* (才) share the same sound in ancient texts,\nWith meaning akin to *waving the enemy away*.\n\n○ The Master of the River Above said:\nIf they persist in wrongdoing,\nThey become thieves to the world—\nYet even if I wish to execute them,\nNo proper formation can be made.\nThough I wish to rage in anger,\nIt is as though I have no arms to repel.\nThough I wish to draw and lure them,\nIt is as though there are no enemies to draw.\nThough I wish to grasp and hold them,\nIt is as though there are no soldiers to seize.\n\n○ The Lin School says: These are all feints of cowardice and weakness\nTo deceive the enemy’s calculations.\n*Eran* means to draw,\nTo lure the enemy to the teacher’s forces.\n\nThus, wielding armies in this way\nIs the path to true victory.\n\nTo act lightly against the enemy and boast in arrogance,\nOne is certain to meet ruin and defeat.\n\n○ The original text by Wang Bi retains *eran* (扔).\n\nNo calamity is greater than reckless contempt for the enemy—\nReckless contempt nearly loses all one holds dear.\n\nWhen armies clash in opposition,\nThe compassionate will prevail.\n\nThe He School says: Do not ask *\"what harm?\"*—\nThe peril is immense.\nThis is the warning against reckless contempt for the enemy,\nThe greatest of calamities.»\n\nThe Sage holds compassion as his treasure,\nAnd Heaven will rescue him—\nGuarding him with compassion.\nNow, when facing the enemy and lightly wielding one’s blade,\nTo seek victory over the world—\nThis is to first destroy one’s own Dao/Way’s treasure.\n\nHence, when two armies meet,\nThe compassionate and humble will prevail.\nThus it is said: *\"View your soldiers as beloved children,\"*\nThus they can die together.\nTo wage war with compassion is to win—\nA single word moves the three armies,\nLike one who embraces a babe and sucks a boil,\nYet soldiers and their fathers fight to the death—\nWho then would dare oppose?\n\nThis passage states that armies cannot be lightly used,\nAnd yet not using them is their greatest application—\nThere is a way beyond mere military force.\n\n○ The Wu School says: He who leads the three armies,\nWhen confronted with battle, fears—\nHe does not dare to lightly scorn the enemy.\nTo lightly scorn the enemy is to lightly engage in war,\nAnd thus to bring slaughter upon oneself while losing one’s compassionate treasure—\nNo calamity is greater.\n\nThough war has not yet been entered,\nYet once the heart holds even a trace of contempt for the enemy,\nThere is the gradual risk of killing and losing one’s treasure—\nHence

Way is known by none, practiced by none.\n\nMaster He said: What is the Way? It is clarity and stillness, simplicity and ease above all. The Way is inherently clear, yet people muddy it; inherently still, yet people agitate it; inherently simple, yet people complicate it; inherently easy, yet people make it difficult.\n\nThe Mysterious Sage speaks: To me, it is most easy to know and to practice; to others, it is impossible to know or to do. The method differs not—it is simply a return to its origin.\n\nTo speak of strength and rigidity is difficult; to speak of gentleness and weakness, is it not easy? To speak of ornate adornment is difficult; to speak of plainness and simplicity, is it not easy? Yet because it is so easy to know, people fail to know it; because it is so easy to practice, people fail to do it—because it is too near.\n\nLiezi could lift a single autumn hair and hear the thunder—these were the words of one who knew the Way.\n\nMaster Li said: The previous chapter spoke of the compassionate prevailing, meaning that benevolence is invincible. Thus, it follows with \"most easy to know, most easy to practice,\" yet the world cannot know or practice it—truly, their faith is insufficient. Even those with faith cannot act—truly, their strength is insufficient.\n\nMaster Wu said: The teachings of Laozi instruct one only in gentleness, weakness, and humility. His words are most easy to know, his deeds most easy to practice. Yet as the age declines and customs corrupt, none in the world can know their worth, nor practice gentleness, weakness, and humility.\n\nWords have their source, deeds have their master.\nOnly those without knowledge fail to recognize me.\nFew know me, thus I am noble.\n\nMaster He said: Laozi’s two phrases—\"words have their source, deeds have their master\"—yet he repeatedly speaks of discarding words, of doing without doing, saying, \"You have lost your origin.\" Though eloquence may abound, it is not as good as few words. This is so.\n\nHold fast to the essential, grasp the root—then you will know how to know, how to practice, how to make it easy.\nThere is nothing else: broad knowledge is difficult for the few; many revere this, and thus knowing becomes easy. Broad practice is difficult for the restless; many submit to this, and thus acting becomes easy.\n\nYet the teachings of the Way have three aspects: what is most easy is near; what is unknown is subtle; and what is without knowledge is forgotten. Thus, the Way, though easy to know, reaches the state of being unknown.\n\nThe Sage’s deeds are such: I transcend the realm of recognition and knowledge, who then can measure me?\nGuan Yinzi could forget the Way only to possess the Way. He also said: If someone asks me, I do not even know myself—how could I know what they seek? This is without words, without deeds, an inner knowing that embraces the Mysterious.\n\nI do not even know myself—how could others know me? If people can know the Way, what is there to value?\nThus, those who attain the Way fear being known by others, yet first fear knowing themselves. Self and others both forgotten—clouds and mist vanish together.\n\nThe most noble is the Way. The great sound is rare in voice—why seek knowledge at all?\nYet the difficulty and ease of knowing are not worth discussing.\n\nMaster Lin said: Among many words, there must be the supreme word, hence \"words have their source.\" All deeds in the world have the Way as their master, hence \"deeds have their master.\" Since the world lacks those who know the supreme word and the supreme Way, none recognize me, hence \"only those without knowledge fail to recognize me.\"\n\nThus, the Sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.\nMaster He said: Liezi dwelled in the fields of Zheng for forty years, unrecognized. Even the king and ministers regarded him as common folk. The virtuous man’s noble bearing appears foolish—thus, the Sage is like one wearing coarse cloth while harboring jade: externally unassuming, yet internally possessing the most noble treasure. *Pò* (褐) is coarse hemp cloth, the garment of the lowly, hence \"wide and ample.\"\n\nMaster Lü said: The Sage has no name; the Perfect Man has no self; the Divine Man has no brilliance. Though his robes are worn and his sandals threadbare, he nurtures his integrity beneath them. His heart is like jade and stone, accumulating the utmost treasure, concealing its radiance, never displaying it. He silently nurtures the embryo of the Way—thus, \"the Sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.\"\n\nMaster Lin said: The Sage’s Way suffices within and does not manifest without—like wearing coarse cloth while harboring jade. Thus, people cannot see it.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One**\nTo know what is unknown—this is supreme.\n\n「To not know what one knows—this is a malady.\nOnly by recognizing this malady as a malady can one avoid it.\nThe Sage does not suffer from this malady because he recognizes it as a malady, hence does not suffer from it.\n\nMaster Lin said: When one attains supreme knowledge yet behaves as if ignorant, this is the highest Dao.\nWhen one presumes to know within the realm of the unknowable, this is the sickness of learning the Dao.\nIf one can recognize this presumption as a malady and treat it as such, then this malady will be cured.\nThe Sage’s way of not suffering from it is that he recognizes this presumption as a malady and treats it as such—this is the most wondrous chapter.\n\nMaster Li said: \"To know what is unknown\" is easy to understand when linked to the previous chapter: The Sage knows all things yet does not presume to know—this is true knowledge.\nThe common folk know nothing yet presume to know—this is false knowledge, hence \"malady.\"\nIf one knows that false knowledge is a malady and treats it as such, then the malady of false knowledge will be cured.\nThe Sage does not suffer from this malady because he recognizes false knowledge as a malady and treats it as such—thus he does not suffer from it.\n\nMaster Lü said: How profound and wondrous is the Dao! It is vast and silent, deep and unfathomable—\nIt cannot be grasped by intellect, cannot be discerned by perception,\nCannot be measured or estimated, cannot be approximated or debated.\nKnowledge is external to it; ignorance is internal to it.\nKnowledge is shallow; ignorance is profound.\nThe Sage perceives the purity of *qi*—his inherent nature is lofty and bright.\nWithin, he harbors true knowledge; all things are naturally awakened.\nOnly then can he attain true ignorance, not boasting of himself—\nThis is called true knowledge and true perception,\nFor he knows the unknowing and the unperceiving.\n\nMoreover, the common folk do not know the essence of the Dao,\nYet they know the coarse aspects of things.\nThey do not know the ultimate of the Dao,\nYet they know the trifling ends of things.\nThey are enslaved by schemes and deceived by phenomena,\nTheir minds filled with cunning, vainly seeking grandeur,\nYet they truly do not know the Dao.\nThey exhaust their spirit, strain their thoughts,\nUsing elaborate words to extinguish essence, using superficiality to drown the heart,\nAnd forcefully argue and justify, claiming to know—\nThis is the malady of *virtue/power*.\n\nThe noble ones attain the Dao and clarify truth;\nThey possess it yet remain humble,\nSealing their lips and tongues,\nPreserving and concealing it, never daring to reveal it.\nThey always act as if ignorant—how much more so when they do not know the Dao—\nYet they indulge in lofty, boastful debates.\nDebaters are not virtuous; knowers are not profound; the profound are not knowers.\n\nMaster He said: The *Zhuangzi* states: \"There have been those who knew through hearing, but never those who knew through ignorance.\"\nHence, deep knowledge without presumption is the highest in the Dao.\nIn the realm of the unknowable, to forcefully presume knowledge—\nThis is the malady of learning the Dao.\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: *Taicheng* asked *Wuqiong*, \"Do you know the Dao?\"\nHe replied, \"I do not know.\"\nAgain, he asked *Wuwei*, \"I know the Dao.\"\nHe asked *Wuji* (the beginningless), and he replied,\n\"I do not know its depths; knowledge is shallow.\nI do not know its interior; knowledge is external.\"\n*Taicheng* knew and sighed, saying:\n\"To not know is to know; to know is to not know—\nWho knows the knowing of not knowing?\"\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two**\nWhen the people do not fear *威* (威), the greatest fear has arrived.\n\nMaster *He Shang Gong* (河上公) said: *威* (威) is harm; people cannot but fear small harm.\nIf they do not fear small harm, great harm will arrive.\n\nMaster Lü said: The *junzi* (君子) has three fears:\nFear of Heaven’s decree (*天命*),\nFear of great *virtue/power* (大人),\nFear of the Sage’s words.\nIf one embodies constancy and adapts to change,\nPreserving the principles of life and death,\nThen within, true essence is manifest and fills all without.\nAnxiety and sorrow cannot penetrate it—\nWhat the multitude fears, one cannot but fear.\nThe foolish do not know Heaven’s decree,\nSeeking only grandeur and excess,\nBearing harm and relying on power,\nBoasting of their virtue and ability.\nThe *Zhuangzi* (*Nanhua Jing*) says:\nThe great foolish never awaken;\nThe great confused never enlighten.\nDo not say that minor evil causes no harm—\nIf one neglects it and does not repent,\nThen when harm accumulates over time,\nEven human *威* cannot be added,\nAnd Heaven’s *威* will surely come.\n\nMaster He said: The ancients said,\n\"To fear *威* as one fears illness is the highest for the people;\nTo follow *威* as one follows a flowing current is the lowest for the people;\nTo see *威* and think of *威* is the middle for the people.\"\nThus, the human heart must never lack something to fear.\nConfucius said: The *junzi* has three fears—\nFear of Heaven’s decree,\nFear of great *virtue/power* (大人),\nFear of the Sage’s words.\nThe petty do not fear Heaven’s decree,\nThey are familiar with great *virtue/power*,\nAnd scorn the Sage’s words.\nGreat *virtue/power* refers to the sternness of rulers and parents,\nAs well as the great *virtue/power* of the worthy—\nThese are indeed worthy of fear, not to be trifled with.\nThe Sage’s words: to violate his precepts,\nOne cannot escape punishment.\nTheir bodies are indeed worthy of fear, not to be scorned.\nYet among the three fears, fear of Heaven’s decree is paramount.\nHeaven’s decree is the natural principle bestowed upon all things by Heaven.\nTo fear it, every thought and word is under the gaze of Heaven and Earth, ghosts and gods—\nNone dare to play or neglect it.\nThe Dao is the shared source of all things; those who attain it live, those who lose it die.\nThe people receive the essence of Heaven and Earth to live,\nThe capable take blessings, the corrupt take calamity—\nThus, the *junzi* fears *yì* (义), the petty fear *xíng* (刑).\nBoth fear Heaven.\nIf one does not fear this *威*, then there is a greater *威*.\nThe *Yì* says: \"If evil is not accumulated, it is not enough to destroy one’s life.\"\nThe petty presume minor evil causes no harm and do not abandon it,\nSo evil accumulates and cannot be concealed,\nGuilt becomes great and cannot be absolved,\nAnd they are punished to death—*凶* (凶), is this not the great *威* that comes from not fearing *威*?\n\nMaster Lin said: Those who do not fear *xíng* (刑) will often meet it.\nDo not narrow one’s dwelling, do not weary of one’s birth—\nThus, one does not weary.\nMaster *He Shang Gong* said: The heart should dwell in the Divine (*神*), broad and gentle,\nNot narrow and rigid.\nThe reason people are born is to possess spirit *qi*—\nIf one neglects its Dao, indulging only in its superficial manifestations,\nThis is called harming the root and wearying the Divine.»\n\nOnly those who do not weary of *spirit-qi* can wash their heart clean of defilement,\npurify their mind of filth, and remain undisturbed by desire—\nthen *spirit-qi* abides within them without weariness.\n\nMaster *He* said:\nWhen one dwells with the Dao, they can inhabit the boundless dwelling of the world,\nso one must not narrow their own abode.\nOtherwise, even a room will seem empty and void,\nand discord will arise between wives and mothers-in-law.\n\nWhen one is born through the Dao, they can nurture all that heaven and earth bring forth,\nso one must not weary of their own birth.\nOtherwise, the mind will lack celestial wandering,\nand the six passions will vie for dominance.\n\nOnly those who take joy in the Dao and do not weary within themselves\nwill not be seen as weary by heaven above or by people below—\nthus, none will weary of them.\n\nMaster *Lin* said:\n*Residence* is the realm of boundless dwelling,\n*birth* is the principle of enduring life and long vision.\nAll people narrow their own abode and weary of their own birth,\nunable to rest in retreat while pursuing advancement,\nunable to observe the void while bewildered by the manifest—\nthis is self-narrowing, self-wearying.\n\n*The void* is a warning against such conduct, saying it must not be so.\n\nOnly those who do not weary can endure long and be at peace—\nthus, it is said: *therefore, none weary.*\n\nMaster *Dong* said:\n*Narrow* means confined, *weary* means to abandon.\n*Wu* (无) should be read as *wu* (毋).\n*Residence* is the foundation of nature—\nto dwell in the world’s boundless abode is to merge with the Great Void.\n*Birth* is the gathering of *qi*—\nto contain the utmost essence of the Great Unity is to harmonize with the creative force.\n\nOnly the narrow-minded cannot be spoken to of the Dao.\nIf one does not drown in petty techniques\nbut instead embodies the void in reality,\nthey will abandon the manifest to cling to the void,\nand be obscured by annihilation,\nthus wearying of their own birth.\nTherefore, one is told: *Do not narrow, do not weary,*\nso that scholars may know that nature is the leader of *qi*,\nits vastness boundless—\none must expand and fill it to preserve its greatness.\n\n*Birth* is the Dao’s manifestation, its use inexhaustible—\none must cherish and nurture it to fulfill its purpose,\nthus nurturing *qi* to perfect life,\nexhausting nature to attain the Mandate,\nand never harboring the mind of abandonment—\nthis is how one embodies strength without force,\nand softness without weakness,\nlong life without greed for life,\nand life not as something lowly.\n\nThus, one dwells with life and the Dao,\nand the Dao never abandons them.\n\nTherefore, the Sage knows themselves without revealing themselves,\nloves themselves without esteeming themselves—\nthus, they discard the former and take the latter.\n\nMaster *He Shang Gong* said:\n*Self-knowing* is to discern one’s own gains and losses;\n*not revealing oneself* is to conceal virtue and beauty within.\n*Self-loving* is to cherish one’s body and preserve *jing-qi*;\n*not esteeming oneself* is to reject high honor and fame in the world.\n*Discarding the former* means discarding self-revelation and self-aggrandizement;\n*taking the latter* means embracing self-knowledge and self-love.\n\nMaster *He* said:\nThe Sage who knows themselves does not dare obscure right and wrong, beauty and evil,\nwhile self-revelation breeds the mind of self-sufficiency.\nSelf-love ensures one does not act lightly toward safety and danger, retreat and advance,\nwhile self-responsibility stirs the arrogance of pride—\nthis is how the distinction between fear and non-fear is made.\n\nBetween the one and the other—what to discard, what to take—\nhow can one not know what to choose?\n\nThe *Collected Commentaries on the True Classic of the Dao* concludes here.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Third:**\n*\"Courageous in daring brings death; courageous in not daring brings life.\nThis pair—sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful—\nwhat the Heavenly detests, who knows its cause?\nThus the Sage finds it difficult.*\n\nMaster **Lin** said:\n*Those courageous in daring will surely harm themselves;\nhesitating before matters is courage in not daring.\nLife comes from preserving oneself,\nwhile daring brings harm and not daring brings benefit—\nthese two are clearly understood.\nHeaven detests fullness and favors humility,\nso the daring are not only reviled by men,\nbut also by Heaven.\nYet few perceive its cause,\nhence the saying: \"who knows its cause?\"\nThe Sage finds it difficult because\nthis Dao is hard to grasp.*\n\nMaster **He** said:\n*The overbearing will not meet their end,\nthose who love victory will surely meet their foe—\nthis is daring, the warning of death.\nHesitating before matters, planning carefully to succeed—\nthis is courage in not daring, the Way of life.\nThis is why the saying holds:\nthe noble will prosper, the petty will perish.\nYet these two—sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful—\nthose who do good often meet fortune,\nwhile those who do ill may sometimes escape harm.\nFrom the first part, prosperity and misfortune\ndepend on good and evil,\nlike the interplay of light and shadow.\nFrom the latter, calamity and blessing\nseem not of our own making.\nOrdinary minds thus conclude:\nHeaven’s preferences and dislikes are inscrutable,\nits causes are unfathomable,\nits deeds are untrustworthy.\nThe Sage reveres Heaven’s command,\ncultivates their virtue to await its unfolding,\nnever daring to apply ordinary reasoning lightly.\nOnly knowing Heaven does not aid the reckless,\nbut demands caution—\nhow could it lack cause?*\n\nMaster **Li** said:\n*Continuing from the previous chapter:\nthe people do not fear authority,\nso how can authority use death to frighten them?\nIf the people were always afraid of death,\nand yet someone dared to act strangely and perversely,\nI could seize and kill them—\nwho would dare?*\nMaster **Lin** said:\n*This chapter explains that distinguishing good and evil,\npreferring or rejecting by one’s own will—\nall this stems from ignorance of the Dao,\nso the ruler is likened to those who enforce punishment.\nThe ruler merely uses death to frighten the people,\nyet the people never truly fear death.\nIf the people truly feared death,\nthen those who acted strangely and perversely\nI could seize and punish—\nthen none would dare.\nBut now, the strange and perverse are killed,\nyet the people’s offenses grow daily—\nthen how have the people ever feared death?*\n\nMaster **Wu** said:\n*\"Strange\" means \"unorthodox.\"\nIf the people were always afraid of death,\nand yet the unorthodox and perverse still acted wickedly,\nI could seize and kill them—\nthen who would dare?\nBut even if wicked men are killed,\nthose who dare to act wickedly do not cease—\nthis means the people are foolish and do not know to fear death.\nThough those who do evil must surely face punishment,\nthey still fear nothing.\nHow can the ruler use death to frighten them,\nyet casually take lives?*\n\nMaster **He of the Yellow River** said:\n*Laozi laments that the kings of his age\ndo not first cultivate Dao and virtue to transform the people,\nbut instead rely on punishments.\nThose who merely enforce punishments,\nwhen they kill, are like carpenters replacing the master—\nfew escape harm to their own hands.*\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Fourth:**\n*\"If the people do not fear death,\nhow can you threaten them with death?\nIf the people were always afraid of death,\nand yet someone acted strangely and perversely,\nI could seize and kill them—\nwho would dare?\"*\n\nMaster **Lin** said:\n*This chapter states that distinguishing good and evil,\npreferring or rejecting by one’s own will—\neven to the point of excess—\nall this is not of the Dao.\nThus the ruler is likened to those who enforce punishment,\nexplaining that punishment is merely used to frighten the people with death,\nyet the people never truly fear death.\nIf the people truly had fear of death,\nthen those who acted strangely and perversely\nI could seize and punish—\nthen none would dare.\nBut now, the strange and perverse are killed,\nyet the people’s offenses only multiply—\nthen how have the people ever feared death?*\n\nMaster **He of the Yellow River** said:\n*Laozi grieves over the times when kings\ndo not first uphold Dao and virtue to transform the people,\nbut instead begin with punishments.\nThose who merely take the place of the executioner,\nwhen they kill, are like apprentices replacing the master carpenter—\nfew escape injury to their own hands.*\n\nLin Shi said:\n*The killer is the Creator. Between Heaven and Earth, whether one does good or evil, there is always one who holds the authority over life and death. Those who should be killed are killed by the Creator itself, hence the saying that there is always one who holds the authority over killing. For a state to be overly concerned with punishment, it is as if one were substituting for the Creator in wielding the authority to kill. Just as a clumsy artisan replacing the master carpenter in cutting wood will rarely avoid injuring their own hands, this is a metaphor within a metaphor. This passage arises from the times’ excessive fondness for killing, yet its intent is not to entirely abolish punishment. Heaven’s retribution for guilt must simply be without malice.*\n\nWu Shi said:\n*If one does not use killing to instill fear in the people, then should those who commit evil not be killed? The one who holds the authority to kill is Heaven itself. Only Heaven can kill, just as only the master carpenter can carve wood. For a man to presume to replace Heaven in killing is like one who is not a carpenter attempting to carve wood in the master’s place. Those who substitute for the carpenter will inevitably injure their hands, and by analogy, those who substitute for Heaven in killing will inevitably harm themselves. Without human calamity, there must be Heaven’s punishment.*\n\nHe Shi said:\n*Though punishment may be wielded by one person, it is not the private domain of any single individual. There is always one who holds authority over punishment and killing. The ruler, in governing, should not presume to take this role upon themselves. Who, then, is the one who holds the authority to kill? Above, there is one who operates in the unseen—Heaven’s retribution for guilt, the Five Punishments, and their proper applications. Below, there is one who operates in the manifest—*as the *Shu* says: *\"The officers regulate the people within the bounds of punishment.\"* The ruler, holding the reins in between, enforces punishment only when necessary. When such necessity arises, they uphold Heaven’s decrees and entrust the matter to the proper authorities, demonstrating fair governance to the people: *\"The people have their own guilt; what concern is it of mine?\"* Killing is the domain of Heaven, of the officers—not mine. Who would dare blame their ruler for this? If this is not followed, it defies Heaven’s order, misuses official punishment, and arrogates its authority as one’s own—just as if the master carpenter should step aside while another, bloodied and exhausted, takes their place in cutting wood. Would this not bring harm?*\n\n*The ruler, with the heart of Heaven and humanity, desires goodness, and thus the people become good. Why then the need for killing? If a ruler governs thus, the world will shift toward virtue and away from guilt, all cherishing life and valuing death. They will welcome the great harmonizing *qi*, this being the unspoken intent of the Sage.*\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Five**\n*The people’s hunger arises from their rulers taking too much in taxes. Thus, they hunger. The people are difficult to govern because their rulers act excessively. Thus, they are difficult to govern.*\n\nLin Shi said:\n*\"Too much in taxes\"* refers to the ruler taking excessively from the people. *\"Their rulers act excessively\"* means those in governance overuse schemes and stratagems. When the ruler is greedy for profit, the people grow hungrier. When the ruler favors cleverness, the people grow harder to govern.\n\nWu Shi said:\n*\"Food\"* refers to what the ruler takes from the people, while *\"taxes\"* are what the people contribute to sustain the ruler’s consumption. If the ruler takes too much from the people, the people grow poor and hungry. If the ruler governs with schemes and stratagems, the people respond with deceit and trickery, making governance difficult.\n\nLü Shi said:\n*The people are the foundation of the state. Of the Eight Governments, food is the priority. Though the discussion of food may seem trivial, the Minister of Agriculture oversees it as a matter of great consequence. If this is mismanaged, harm to the people will be severe. The Sage allotted land, exhorted officials, and ensured they did not disrupt the seasons. Taxation was regulated to avoid overburdening the people. The *Nine-Tenths* law was relaxed, and the *Tenth* tax was established—prioritizing what was lightest. If, however, the ruler disregards the people’s proper seasons, drains their strength with extraordinary demands to satisfy insatiable desires, the people will suffer under the crushing weight of taxes. Exhausted and emaciated, they will show signs of famine, the wilds will echo with the cries of the starving, bandits and thieves will multiply, and deceit will flourish unseen within the state. The body relies on *qi* for the people’s vitality; when *qi* is depleted, the spirit weakens. Now, speaking of their hunger is to say their *qi* is insufficient. This is why they cannot abandon speech and desire—hence, *\"The people’s hunger arises from their rulers taking too much in taxes. Thus, they hunger.\"* In ancient times, the people lived in peace, content with their customs, their fields yielding enough to eat, their weaving enough to wear. Who would say they were difficult to govern? But if the ruler acts with excess, desire, and interference—imposing dense nets of laws, harsh decrees, and convoluted governance—they will only agitate the people, who cannot endure such disturbance. Thus, they are difficult to govern. It is like one’s own breath: difficult to purify but easy to foul, easy to coarsen but difficult to refine. How much more so when the ruler’s actions agitate it further?*\n\n*The people’s indifference to death arises from their excessive pursuit of life. Only those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.*\n\nLin Shi said:\n*Generally, those who love themselves too much risk losing their lives. Overindulgence in food and drink can bring illness—this is one example. Overvaluing self-preservation and excessive care for life lead to reckless schemes to secure it, hence *\"the excessive pursuit of life.\"* They risk their lives in pursuit of it, hence *\"indifferent to death.\"* To forget the self is to preserve the self, hence *\"those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\"* To prize life is akin to the previous chapter’s *\"increasing life\"*—the excessive pursuit of life. *\"Prize\"* here means *\"excel.\"**\n\nWu Shi said:\n*\"Indifferent\"* means *\"easy.\"* *\"The excessive pursuit of life\"* refers to an overattachment to living. *\"Wiser\"* means *\"excel.\"* To prize life is to hold it in high regard, the same as the excessive pursuit of life. When one’s attachment to life is heavy and self-preservation is overdone, they may seek not to die yet instead make death easy. The perfected do not fail to cherish life, but they follow nature, harboring no contrivances. If one does not cling to life, their body remains unharmed—this excels over those who prize life with their hearts, yet paradoxically make death easy.\n\nHe Shi said:\n*\"Those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\"* This is what is meant by *\"harmonizing with the Creator\"* and *\"wandering in the unified qi of Heaven and Earth.\"* They forget their liver and gallbladder, abandon their ears and eyes, reversing and returning to the beginning and end without knowing where to start or stop. Lost in the vastness beyond dust and filth, they drift effortlessly in the realm of *wuwei*, unharmed by things. This surpasses those who excessively cherish life—through this, all under Heaven preserve their lives. Is this not wondrous?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Six**\n*\"The living are soft and weak; the dead are rigid and strong.*\n*All things—grasses and trees—are soft and brittle when alive; when dead, they wither and decay.\"*\n\nLu Shi said:\n*\"The Dao is the master of the spirit; the spirit is the master of qi; qi is the master of the body. When the Dao abides, the spirit abides; when the spirit abides, qi abides. Thus, when a person is born, they contain the primordial *yuanhe* qi and embrace the true unity of essence. Their form is whole, their spirit flourishes, and the myriad *jing* converge at the origin, flowing and ceasing not. Hence, their softness and weakness are evident.*\n\n*When they die, the *yuanhe* qi disperses, the true unity of essence is exhausted, the form decays, and the spirit departs. Then the hundred limbs grow rigid and strong. Hence it is said: ‘The living are soft and weak; the dead are rigid and strong.’*\n\n*Consider this: when grasses and trees are born, the qi of Heaven and Earth flows within them, and the yin-yang qi nourishes them without. When spring qi stirs, the nourishing rain falls abundantly, and sprouts unfold in lush splendor. Yet when frost and wind blow, killing qi follows, and they wither, their branches and twigs decaying.*\n\n*The enlightened see life and death as the abiding or fading of the Dao; the unenlightened see vitality and decay as the gathering or scattering of qi. Hence it is said: ‘All things—grasses and trees—are soft and brittle when alive; when dead, they wither and decay.’\"*\n\nWu Shi said:\n*\"When a person lives, their flesh and skin are soft and supple, capable of bending and stretching. When dead, their flesh and skin grow cold and rigid, unable to bend or stretch. Grasses and trees, when alive, have pliable stems; when dead, their stems wither and harden.\"*\n\nLin Shi said:\n*\"Soft and weak, rigid and strong—these are metaphors. Laozi’s teaching emphasizes valuing softness, thus using the birth and death of humans and plants as illustrations. Therefore, those who are rigid and strong are companions of death, while those who are soft and weak are companions of life.\"*\n\nLu Shi said:\n*\"Where yang qi resides, even wood can be bent and grass bound. Where yang qi departs, even water can congeal and ice shatter. Thus, the luminous yang qi is the root of life. Softness and weakness are the sprouts of things. Those who seek rigidity must guard it with softness; those who seek strength must preserve it with weakness. Now, rigidity cannot nurture harmony—it opposes things. How could it avoid harm? Softness and weakness do not lose the mean—they move with things, thus preserving life.\"*\n\nHe Shi said:\n*\"The soft and weak of the world—the Dao and qi—are what permeate Heaven and Earth and embrace all things. Thus, those who align with life must have the Dao and qi within them; those who align with death must have the Dao and qi depart from them.\"*\n\nLin Shi said:\n*\"Companions—here meaning ‘kindred.’\"*\n\nWu Shi said:\n*\"The earlier text speaks of the forms of humans and plants—when alive, they are soft; when dead, they are rigid. Extending this principle, one sees that those whose conduct is rigid and strong do not attain death properly—they are companions of death. Those who are soft and weak preserve life well—they are companions of life. Hence, strong armies do not conquer, and strong trees are felled. The strong and mighty are placed below; the soft and weak are placed above.\"*\n\nLu Shi said:\n*\"Arms are instruments of violence and conflict, clashing with opposing forces. Relying on strength and despising the enemy is unrighteous. To act unrighteously and yet presume victory—how could it succeed? Thus it is said: ‘Strong arms do not conquer.’ Small trees are soft and weak, but when they grow strong, they become thick enough to encircle with both hands. If wood is thus, how much more so for humans? How much more so for nations? Hence it is said: ‘Strong trees are felled.’ The strong and mighty are bold warriors; the soft and weak embody the Way of the gentleman. Those who rely on force see strength as victory; those who rely on virtue see softness as victory. Thus, there is an eternal victorious Way called softness, and an eternal defeated Way called rigidity. Alas, the world’s people rely on force, not virtue, forgetting the root and chasing the branches. The enlightened observe this with the Dao, and thus know that softness overcomes rigidity—this is the necessary truth.\"*\n\nHe Shi said:\n*\"Sharp teeth break; the soft tongue survives—this is the way. ‘Felled’ as in encircling a tree with both hands—things grow old when they reach their peak; this is called *not the Dao*. Why do strong arms fail to conquer? Because they rely on the might of their nation, boast in their people’s numbers, and seek to intimidate enemy states—these are *proud armies*, and proud armies perish. The strong and mighty are placed below; the soft and weak are placed above—not merely an analogy with trees, but the application of softness to govern the world, which is the Way of the sovereign. To arrogantly exalt oneself is but the shortsightedness of a well-frog. Can those in high station not take heed? It is not only Daoists who uphold humility and weakness.\"*\n\nLin Shi said:\n*\"Those who rely on the strength of arms will not conquer. Young trees are soft and weak; when they grow old and rigid, they reach a thickness where they can be encircled with both hands—then they wither. Thus, those who understand the Dao value softness and weakness as superior, and rigidity and strength as inferior.\"*\n\nWu Shi said:\n*\"‘Felled’—the encircling of a tree with both hands.\"*\n\nDong Shi said:\n*\"This chapter speaks of how softness and weakness preserve the harmonious qi.\"*\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven**\n*\"The Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow: the high are lowered, the low are raised, the excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\"*\n\n「Lü Shi said:\n*\"The Dao of Heaven follows the Way of Dao, sharing its function: it accomplishes without action, transforms without speech. The four seasons rely on it to unfold, and all things await it to flourish. It never strays from its course, yet never fails in its impartial, upright principle. Hence, it is said: ‘The Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow.’*\n\n*Now, the artisan who crafts a bow—without slaying or sparing, without favor or coercion—shapes it by compass and square, guided by true measure. If the string is too high or too taut, he relaxes and softens it; if too low or slack, he draws and tightens it. What is in excess is trimmed away, what is lacking is filled in, so that the bow may be bent and the arrows may fly.*\n\n*The ruler’s Way should emulate Heaven’s: to suppress the strong and support the weak, to diminish excess and supplement deficiency, to loosen and tighten, to refine and temper—so that every stroke finds its mark, and precision is the Dao. To balance gain and loss, to apply measures justly, to act as outer and inner counterpart—this aligns with Heaven’s function.*\n\n*Heaven’s principle is grasped in the heart and executed by the hand, hence the saying: ‘The high are lowered, the low are raised, the excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.’*\n\n○ *Li Shi said:*\n*\"Continuing the previous chapter’s meaning of strength and weakness—diminishing excess, supplementing deficiency—that is the Way of Heaven.*\n*Those who are strong and great must be diminished; those who are weak must be benefited.\"*\n\n○ *Dong Shi said:*\n*\"Heaven’s Way is without partiality, all must conform to moderation.*\n*Heaven’s Way diminishes excess and supplements deficiency. But human ways are otherwise: we diminish deficiency to serve excess.\"*\n\n○ *Lü Shi said:*\n*\"To act without doing yet hold in esteem—that is Heaven’s Way. To have doing yet remain humble—that is humanity’s Way.*\n*Heaven’s Way is to govern through transformation; humanity’s is to administer through ritual. Heaven, when in excess, diminishes; when lacking, bestows. This cannot be grasped by those with intent, nor approached by those without intent—it responds naturally and acts in silence.*\n\n*But humanity is not so. Our nature strays from balance, our emotions are divided; we prefer the high and despise the low, serve the full and discard the empty, unable to align with Heaven’s principle of diminishing and supplementing. Thus, we are far from the Dao.\"*\n\n○ *Lin Shi said:*\n*\"Heaven, in its treatment of all things, is ever thus.*\n*Yet why does humanity’s Way differ? It seeks to diminish others while benefiting itself, to take from the world’s deficiency to fill its own excess—this is contrary to Heaven’s intent.*\n*Who can sacrifice their own excess to nourish the world? Only those who embody the Dao.\"*\n\n○ *Lü Shi said:*\n*\"Moreover, excess cannot be left untrimmed, deficiency cannot be left unsupplemented.*\n*Thus, those who embody the Dao do not only love their own kin nor only cherish their own children—they love the world’s children as their own. In their regard for others, they are heavy; in their regard for themselves, they are light. Who but the sages could achieve this?*\n*Hence the saying: ‘Who can sacrifice their own excess to nourish the world? Only those who embody the Dao.’\"*\n\n○ *Lin Shi said:*\n*\"Only those who embody the Dao can diminish my excess to nourish the world.\"*\n\n○ *Li Shi said:*\n*\"Only those who embody the Dao act in accordance with Heaven, diminishing artificiality while benefiting true nature, diminishing abundance while supplementing scarcity, diminishing self while benefiting others, diminishing excess and supplementing deficiency—diminishing again and again until it reaches the state of non-action.*\n*Hence, the sage acts yet does not rely on his deeds, achieves yet does not claim his accomplishments, and does not desire to be seen as virtuous. He does not boast of his own excellence or seek self-satisfaction; though his deeds are done and his affairs settled, he does not dwell upon them. He does not wish for the world to know his virtue—if his virtue were manifest to all, then he would be esteeming himself, which is not the way of the Dao.\"*\n\n○ *Lü Shi said:*\n*\"The sage’s wisdom is all-encompassing, his mind adapts to all things. Though he benefits all things, he does not claim righteousness; though his grace extends to all ages, he does not claim benevolence. He has no intent to praise himself, acting yet not boasting of his skill, nor seeking self-fulfillment. When his deeds are accomplished and his affairs settled, he does not dwell upon them—he does not wish for others to know his virtue. If his virtue were made known to the world, then he would be esteeming himself, which is not the way of the Dao.\"*\n\n○ *Lin Shi said:*\n*\"Though the sage acts in the world, he does not rely on his deeds; though his accomplishments are realized, he does not claim them; though his conduct is the most virtuous, he does not wish to be seen for it. This is the Dao’s principle of continual diminishment—until one diminishes even the act of diminishment.\"*\n\n○ *Wu Shi said:*\n*\"The sage’s achievements can cover the world—this is his excess. Yet he does not rely on his own ability, as though he had none; he does not claim his own accomplishments, as though he had none; he does not desire to display his ability as superior to others. All of these are acts of diminishing his own excess.\"*\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight**\n*\"In the world, there is none softer or weaker than water, yet none better at overcoming hardness and strength—nothing can replace it.\"*\n\n○ *Lü Shi said:*\n*\"The things of the world vary, yet none surpasses water in its extreme softness and weakness. It levels mountains, erodes stone, clears blockages, overcomes hardness and strength, benefiting all things and entering all things. It follows the dictates of man—whether confined or released—and adapts to the shape of its vessel, whether square or round. It transforms into vapor, into clouds and rain, into frost and snow. Hence, Heaven first generates water, from which springs the ceaseless flow of sources and streams, vast and boundless, though winding a thousand times or turning a million times, it never ceases to be water. This is the embodiment of the marvelous unity of the harmonious qi.*\n\n*Yet in its application to all things, water can be strong or weak, rigid or soft—thus it can overcome all things, approaching the Dao, and nothing can replace it.*\n\n*In the body, there is none softer or weaker than the essence of Hua Tu (华池灵液). The perfected one circulates and directs it, reaching every place. Sometimes they rinse and swallow it to irrigate the five viscera; sometimes they manipulate and transport it to reach the three pass points. Even to the point of permeating the lower back’s aperture (透尾闾), passing the spine’s interstices (过夹脊), flowing upward against the current (泝流直上), and supplementing the brain (而补於脑)—none but the divine water could achieve this.\"*\n\n○ *He Shi said:*\n*\"Water can be directed east or west to flow. In the world, there is none more supremely soft and weak than water. It erodes the stone of Tai Mountain (穿太山之石), breaches a thousand-golden floodbank (决千金之堤), and overcomes hardness and strength—this is an unalterable truth from ancient to modern times.\"*\n\n「○ Lin Shi said: Water is supremely weak yet can overcome hardness and strength—none in the world can rival it. The thousand-golden floodbank (千金之堤) is undone by the leak of an ant’s burrow (蚁穴之漏), thus proving that weakness can triumph over strength, and none can surpass water in this.\n\nWeakness triumphing over strength, softness overcoming hardness—none in the world does not know this, yet none can practice it.\n\n○ Lü Shi said: Water extinguishes fire, yin subdues yang; the tongue is soft yet the teeth are hard, yet when the tongue survives, the teeth perish. None in the world does not know this, yet it is a common saying among the vulgar.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven does not contend with things, yet thus overcomes them. Common folk always desire to contend with things, yet few can overcome them.\n\nIndeed, those who know yet cannot practice it cannot achieve their aims in the world; those who know and can practice it may achieve their aims in the world.\n\n○ He Shi said: In the *Liezǐ* (《列子》), it is said that there are unchanging ways of victory and unchanging ways of defeat. The unchanging way of victory is called *softness* (柔), the unchanging way of defeat is called *strength* (强). These two principles are easy to know, yet people do not recognize them. Master Huangshi (黄石公) instructed Zhifang (子房), yet only spoke of *softness overcoming hardness* (柔胜刚) and *weakness overcoming strength* (弱胜强). This is a principle easy to know yet not understood, and even those who know it cannot practice it—only the sage can know and practice it.\n\n○ Lin Shi said: Weakness overcoming strength, softness overcoming hardness—like water, this is plainly visible, yet none in the world can practice it. The supreme Dao/Way lies in those who can be soft and weak, yet none can practice this.\n\n○ Li Shi said: Softness overcomes hardness, weakness overcomes strength—all know this yet none can practice it. Why? Because they refuse to humble themselves. Hence, the sage says:\n\n*\"To bear the filth of the state (受国之垢) is to be called its sovereign (社稷主).\nTo bear the misfortunes of the state (受国之不祥) is to be called the King of the world (天下王).\nTo speak straight yet reverse the meaning (正言若反).\"*\n\n○ Lü Shi said: The sage’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth are supremely vast, encompassing all things great and small, coarse and fine, and their likes and dislikes. The sage is supremely exalted, and all—wise and foolish, noble and ignoble—turn to him for support.\n\nAgain, the sage can endure filth and conceal it, tolerate insults and embrace chaos, thus aiding the Dao/Way of *ren* (仁) and *yi* (义), of softness and weakness overcoming strength. Then the people revere his virtue and do not scatter. He can perpetually serve as the sovereign of the state (社稷主).\n\nThe sage practices humility and submission, following Heaven’s course. Wars, calamities, droughts, and locust plagues are all the fate of *effort* (劫运), which Heaven sometimes uses to admonish people. If the sage does not lay blame upon others but instead takes it upon himself, then the Four Seas will return to *ren* (仁), and the Six Directions will find their home in his heart. Thus, he can become the King of the world (天下王).\n\nHence it is said: *\"To bear the misfortunes of the state (受国不祥) is to be called the King of the world (天下王).\"*\n\nThe vulgar regard bearing filth and misfortunes as something to be reviled, yet the sage regards them as something to be rejoiced in. Rejoicing in what others revile may not necessarily bring fortune; reviling what others rejoice in may not necessarily bring disaster.\n\nTo speak straight yet reverse the meaning (正言若反)—this is because the vulgar conceal their own faults while exposing others’, whereas the sage acknowledges his own faults while concealing others’. Thus, their words diverge; only the sage’s words are truly upright, hence *\"to speak straight yet reverse the meaning.\"*\n\n○ He Shi said: The term *\"orphans, widows, and the destitute\"* (孤寡不谷) is used by kings and nobles, all of which reflect the principle of *softness overcoming hardness* (柔胜刚). This is the true principle of the world, yet people do not know or practice it. When they hear the sage speak of *softness overcoming hardness*, they think it contradictory, yet it is truly the correct teaching.\n\n○ Dong Shi said: This chapter states that softness and weakness, when able to contain, become what all things turn to. The seventy-ninth chapter says: *\"To reconcile great grievances (和大怨) must leave some remnant grievance; how can this be called a good Dao/Way?\"*\n\n○ Lin Shi said: Only when one forgets both恩 (恩) and怨 (grievance) does one know the supreme Dao/Way. If a person harbors great怨 (grievance) against me yet I still desire to reconcile it, though I have no lingering resentment, I still recognize that it is a grievance. Then this heart is not yet transformed.\n\nThough it is said that I can reconcile it, my heart is not yet transformed, so the remnant grievance remains. How can this be called a good Dao/Way? This is indeed a profound statement, yet it is also an analogy.\n\n○ Lü Shi said: Grievances and enmities have already run deep, and the chasm between enemies is already vast. Even if one ultimately concedes what is right and wrong, affirming what is wrong and denying what is right, repays them with virtue, and straightens them with righteousness, how could there ever be no lingering regret?\n\nIt is better to forget both恩 (恩) and怨 (grievance), and let the Dao/Way reconcile and transform them. Then the grieved will not need reconciliation before they are already reconciled.\n\nBiqiuzi (碧虚子) said that knowing of a grievance yet reconciling it is not as good as having no grievance to reconcile. If one reconciles and repays grievances with laws and governance, how can this be called a good Dao/Way?\n\n○ Li Shi said: Building upon the previous chapter’s principle of *hardness and softness*, to reconcile with恩 (恩), though grievances may be resolved, the heart remains unchanged. How can this be called a good Dao/Way? It is better to blame oneself and forget both恩 (恩) and怨 (grievance). When恩 (恩) and怨 (grievance) are both forgotten, the people will naturally feel gratitude and respond with loyalty.\n\nHence, the sage holds the *left contract* (执左契) yet does not demand repayment from others.\n\n○ Lin Shi said: The *left contract* (左契) is like the written agreements of today. One party holds the left half, the other holds the right half, hence the term *left contract*.\n\nIf this contract is held by me, then the other party must fulfill their obligations. Though the sage holds this contract, he does not demand repayment from others, but instead forgets and transforms.\n\n○ Lü Shi said: In ancient times, people tied knots in ropes to make agreements, yet the people did not deceive. They split wooden tablets to make contracts, yet the people did not violate them. Thus, the sage harmonized human Dao/Way with Heaven’s Dao/Way, and human heart with Heaven’s heart. Hence, holding the contract on the left (执左契) signifies agreement, and combining it on the right (合之于右) signifies trust. Not demanding repayment from others also corresponds with Heaven’s will. Here, there is no blame; there, there is no fault. Above and below are in harmony, and there is no blame for grievances. Hence it is said: *\"The sage holds the left contract yet does not demand repayment from others.\"*\n\n○ Wu Shi said: *\"The sage holds the left contract yet does not demand repayment from others\"* means he has no expectations of things.\n\nThe *contract* (契) is a wooden tablet split in two, with each party keeping one half to demonstrate sincerity. When one demands repayment of money or goods from another, it is called *responsibility* (责). The contract has left and right halves: the left half is held by the party who gives the money or goods, and the right half is given to the party who comes to take them. Master Lin of Lichuan (临川王氏) said: The *Shiji* (《史记》) states: *\"He held the left contract to demand repayment\"* (操左契以责事), and the *Liji* (《礼记》) states: *\"Those who offer land and residences hold the left contract\"* (献田宅者操左契). Thus, it is known that the left half is held by the party who receives responsibility.»\n\nThus, the virtuous govern through trust, while the unvirtuous demand clarity.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven favors none, yet always aids the good.\nMaster Lin said: The virtuous hold the contract, yet seek nothing in return. The unvirtuous, however, demand only clarity.\n*Simply* (彻) means to make clear.\nIt is like when people today say, *\"Let us settle this clearly\"* (必与之讨分晓).\n\nThose who govern through virtue are the good—Heaven, without favor, aids such people, hence it is said: *\"Heaven always aids the good.\"*\n\nMaster He said: The contract is a binding agreement, like written covenants or pacts.\nThe virtuous gain the Dao/Way and many allies—like the contract held within, merging without demand. The unvirtuous lose the Dao/Way and have few allies—even if they forcefully demand clarity from others, who would answer them? *Zhuangzi* despised those who sought to force connections—this is the case.\n\nIf one truly possesses virtue and morality, why would Heaven alone not aid them? The august Heaven favors none, only virtue does it support. Thus it is said: *\"I do not know those who do good, nor those who do evil.\"* Accumulated goodness attracts benevolent qi; accumulated evil attracts malevolent qi. Accumulated goodness summons divine assistance—Heaven’s Dao/Way naturally aids the good.\n\nMaster Li said: The contract is a pledge of trust; *simply* (彻) means to make clear.\nThe virtuous hold their pledges, while the unvirtuous demand only clarity—knowing only to judge by law, yet unaware that such strictness would leave no people. Those who govern through virtue preserve sincerity, aligning with the people’s hearts.\n\nMaster Lü said: The *Classic of Documents* states: *\"The august Heaven is impartial, aiding only virtue.\"* The *I Ching* says: *\"Heaven aids them—auspicious, with no misfortune.\"* Heaven’s Dao/Way never distinguishes between giving or taking; doing good generates benevolent qi, doing evil generates malevolent qi—naturally corresponding.\nFor the supremely virtuous, harmony arises naturally, favoring only the good—why demand contracts or responsibility from others? This is the way of the ancient past.\n\n**Chapter Eighty: Small States, Few People**\nIn small states with few people, let there be weapons numbering in tens and hundreds, yet unused. Let the people value life so deeply that they do not wander far.\n\nMaster Lin said: Small states with few people—like Mencius’ saying that even a hundred *li* of land could be used to gather lords and unify the world. Laozi meant that those who embody the Dao/Way, if granted even a small state and few people, would govern them simply. Let there be *shí-bǎi* (什伯) formations—like today’s neighborhood watches—where each person has usable skills, yet does not seek personal gain. Thus, all act like gentlemen, content in retreat, valuing life so deeply that they do not wander far. The common people fear doing wrong and remain settled in their homes.\n\nMaster He said: Small states with few people are not inferior to vast lands and many subjects. Governing by the Dao/Way means even smallness can illuminate greatness.\n*Shí-bǎi* refers to communal tools—according to a Western Han decree prohibiting officials’ residences from storing *shí* (什, ten) items, Preface Master Yan (颜师古) noted: *\"Five men form a *wǔ* (伍), ten form a *shí*—sharing tools, hence called *shí-wǔ* equipment, or *shí* goods, like today’s military units where ten form a team, sharing supplies and logistics.\"* Ten make a *shí*, a hundred make a *bǎi*—calculable numbers. If the people have *shí-bǎi* tools yet do not use them, there is no need for travel or storage, sparing labor and taxes—this is the ideal of *\"no affairs where there are none.\"*\n\nStates, whether small or vast in Heaven and Earth, thrive with non-action and falter with interference. If the people once fled lightly for their lives, now that they cherish life, none would stray—who would compel them?\n\nMaster Wu said: Ten make a *shí*, a hundred make a *bǎi*—*shí-bǎi* tools are heavy implements shared by many. *\"Unused\"* means no scheming or greed, so heavy tools serve no purpose. *\"Valuing death\"* means treating life as precious and nurturing it. *\"Not wandering far\"* means living and dying in the same place, never relocating. Laozi sought to reverse the decline of the Zhou, restoring the simplicity of antiquity. Since large states with many people are hard to govern, he spoke modestly: if even a small state with few people could be governed thus, the people would have no desire for the outside, content within.\n\nThough there are boats and carriages, they are not used. Though there are armor and weapons, they are not displayed. The people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\n\nTheir food is sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, their customs joyful.\nNeighboring states are close enough to hear the sounds of roosters and dogs, yet the people die of old age without visiting one another.\n\nMaster Lin said: Though there are boats and carriages, they are not used for distant journeys seeking profit. Though there are armor and weapons, they are not displayed for reliance on force to win. Abandoning written contracts, they return to using knotted cords—reverting to primordial simplicity. Sweet food, fine clothing, secure homes, and joyful customs: neighboring states are near, roosters crow and dogs bark, yet the people die of old age without traveling—each self-sufficient, seeking nothing.\n\nMaster He said: Boats and carriages serve desires—now that the people have few desires, what need is there to ride them? Armor and weapons are used for conflict—now that the people have no conflicts, why display them? Knotted cords were used before writing—now to revive them is to return to ancient purity. Sweet food and fine clothing come from tilling and weaving—no hunger, no cold. Secure homes and joyful customs: their movements are slow, their awareness serene, content and at ease. Neighboring states are close, roosters crow and dogs bark, yet none go nor come—seeking nothing from the world, they age and die. This flourishing of ancient customs comes from the ancient sage’s governance.\n\nMaster Wu said: This speaks of having myriad tools yet not using them. Boats, carriages, armor, and weapons—none are things a single person can employ alone; these are what is meant by \"myriad tools.\" To have nothing to ride upon, nothing to display—this means they are not used. Without need for travel, there is no use for boats and carriages; without strife, there is no use for armor and weapons. When the people are pure and their affairs simple, even the ancient system of knotted cords could be revived. Though writing replaced knotted cords, it too would not be used.\n\nNot only are myriad tools unused, but the food they eat is deemed sweet, the clothing they wear deemed fine—self-sufficient, nurturing life with what they have. This is what is meant by valuing death. They find contentment in their dwellings and joy in their customs—this is to say they do not migrate far. Those who value death will age and die in the place of their birth; who would lightly abandon it for distant lands?\n\nWhen the people cherish their native soil, even neighboring states—visible to the eye, their roosters crowing and dogs barking audible to the ear—though so near, none go to visit, let alone migrate far.\n\n**Chapter 81**\n*\"True words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not true.\nThe virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\"*\n\nMaster Lü said: Words of truth are plain and unadorned, like water—water is bland yet enduring. What is not beautiful is because its essence is bitter. Beautiful words are sweet and nourishing, pleasing to the ear, like fine wine—yet wine’s sweetness fades quickly. What is untrue is hollow beneath its ornamentation. Hence, *\"True words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not true.\"*\n\nThose who are truly virtuous value action over eloquence, holding to simplicity. Those skilled in argument prize persuasion, entangled in right and wrong, yet lacking true understanding. Hence, *\"The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\"*\n\nThose who grasp the Dao understand principles and penetrate to their roots, seizing the essential—this is to be unified in one, completing all things. Why seek breadth? The broadly learned are versed in things, immersed in affairs, their substance obscured by ornamentation, their minds drowned in multiplicity, seeking only what is right—yet unaware that excess leads to confusion. Hence, *\"The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\"*\n\nMaster Lin said: True words lack adornment; what is adorned is not true. *The Zhuangzi* conceals itself in splendor, taking broad knowledge as skill, boasting of it—this is not the way of the wise.\n\nMaster Li said: *\"True words are not beautiful\"*—loyal words are harsh to hear. *\"Beautiful words are not true\"*—flattering speech is deceitful. True words are plain and unadorned; false words are embellished. Those who truly follow the Dao make no distinctions, hence do not argue. Those skilled in argument are the cause of strife. Hence, the truly wise are luminous yet not dazzling, hence not broadly learned. The broadly learned are superficial in sight, hence lack true knowledge.\n\nThe Sage does not hoard. The more one gives to others, the more one possesses; the more one shares, the more one has. Master Lü said: *The Zhuangzi* speaks of the Dao’s movement without accumulation, thus all under heaven revere it. The Sage’s \"not hoarding\" means spreading virtue for others—those who receive it see their virtue grow ever brighter, like a mirror’s clarity, never diminished. To distribute wealth to the poor: the poor accept the gift, yet the giver’s wealth grows ever fuller, like a wellspring’s clear, unending flow, from which all things draw without depletion. Master Liezi said that giving wealth is the mark of an accomplished person, while sharing virtue is the mark of the Sage—both embody \"not hoarding.\"\n\nBecause there is accumulation, there is lack; because there is no hoarding, there is abundance. Hence, *\"The Sage does not hoard; the more one gives to others, the more one possesses; the more one shares, the more one has.\"*\n\nMaster He said: Why does the Sage not hoard? *The Zhuangzi* says the Dao moves without accumulation, thus all things flourish. The Sage acts without hoarding, thus all under heaven revere them. Hence, *\"Because there is accumulation, there is lack; because there is no hoarding, there is abundance.\"* The Sage’s giving to others only increases their own abundance, sharing with others only multiplies their own wealth—whether through virtue or wealth, demonstrating sincerity, doing good for others, accumulating yet dispersing, broadly learned yet transforming—all embody the intent of making the world public.\n\nMaster Lin said: The Sage’s Dao is but emptiness and unity—what is there to hoard? They never fail to benefit others, yet their own abundance grows ever greater. They never fail to share with others, yet their own wealth multiplies evermore. It is like the Dao of Heaven: empty yet unyielding, moving yet ever producing. To benefit others and be benefited in return, to speak the Dao and transform things—this is the Dao of Heaven.\n\n*\"The Dao of Heaven benefits all without harming.\nThe Sage’s Dao acts without strife.\"*\n\nMaster Lü said: The Dao of Heaven is the Yang—it loves life and abhors killing, hence is beneficial without harm. Spring and summer nurture growth; autumn and winter bring maturation. In its utter impartiality, it fulfills what is good in people yet does not complete what is evil. It gives benefit to all without inflicting harm. Hence, *\"The Dao of Heaven benefits all without harming.\"*\n\nHeaven speaks not yet responds perfectly, always answering with substance, not with empty words. The Sage embodies this as harmony, establishes it as practice, and applies it—thus aligned with Heaven, in accord with the Sage. This is the *\"six penetrations and four openings,\"* the root of all things, yet without strife.\n\nMaster He said: The Dao of Heaven benefits all without harm; the Sage’s Dao accomplishes all without strife.\n\nThe *Yì* says: **\"Qián** [the Creative, Heaven] begins with the power to bring beauty and benefit to the world—yet does not speak of what it benefits. How vast it is! The primal essence of Qián is firm and strong, balanced and upright, a pure and refined concentration of *qi*. Clouds move, rain falls—all things are at peace.**\n\nThe Sage who embodies Qián [the Creative] fulfills the Dao completely and brings beauty to all. With boundless generosity, he aids and rescues the people, accomplishing much yet never striving—all from the wondrous application of the Qián essence.\n\nIn the final chapter of *Lǎozǐ* [Laozi], the first words are removed, then the Sage and the people are discussed, finally aligning with the Dao of Heaven and the Sage. Their functions are thus fully expressed—is this not already complete?\n\nTo know *Yì* [the *Yijing*] is to know *Lǎozǐ* [Laozi].\n\n○ **Lín Shì** said: The Dao of Heaven, though it brings beauty and benefit without speaking of what it benefits, is seen only as beneficial and without harm. If one speaks of its benefiting, then harm also becomes apparent. The Sage’s Dao is effortless yet accomplishes all, yet he never relies on his own power—thus he does not contend with things, yet the world cannot contend with him.\n\nThe essence of this text is largely centered on *non-contention*—hence it concludes with these words.\n\n○ **Lǐ Shì** said: The greatest *virtue/power* of Heaven and Earth is *generation*—hence it is said, *\"benefit without harm.\"* The Sage upholds his station with *rén* [benevolence/heart-mind]—hence it is said, *\"accomplish without contention.\"*\n\nIf one practices the principle of *non-contention* in daily life, over time and with purity, one will naturally attain the realm of *Hùn Yuán* [the Primordial Chaos], the *true constant Dao*, and reach its utmost perfection. This is the foundation of the *Emperor’s* [the Sage’s] first manifestation, the source of profound clarity—it is achieved.\n\nThe *True Scripture of the Dao and Virtue* [the *Daodejing*] concludes its compilation of meaning in the tenth volume.",

      "translated_text": "**The *Zhenjing* of *Daode* with Collected Meanings**\n\n**Title:** *The Zhenjing of Daode with Collected Meanings*\nA compilation by Master Wēi Dàyǒu, in ten volumes.\nOriginal source: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), *Dòngshén* (Cavernous Gods) section, *Yùjué* (Jade Precepts) category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Zhenjing of Daode***\n\nThe *Daode Jing*, both *Shang* (Upper) and *Xia* (Lower) chapters, comprises over five thousand words. Within it are encompassed the Dao of preserving and cultivating life’s essence, and without, the affairs of governance and harmonizing the world—none are omitted. This is the learning of *inner sage, outer king* (nèishèng wàiwáng).\n\nThe *Shǐ* (historians) placed it between *Shēn* and *Hán*, and the world thus came to call it the *Yellow Emperor’s Legalism*, which is vastly different from what the Daoist tradition truly holds—this cannot but be flawed.\n\nWhen the Zhou declined and the Way of the Sage waned, its intent to save the age and benefit the people was embedded within, yet it was not solely about self-cultivation. Cao Pǎn, Marquis Gāo, found that *clearing and stillness, non-action* bore fruit in governance, and his application was not far from the practical principles of the age. How much more so for the teachings of withdrawal from the world, which were thereby greatly expanded!\n\nSome, failing to grasp the profound origins of its meaning, dismiss it outright as empty, bizarre, and fanciful—how could such be true understanding of the Dao?\n\nOver a hundred schools of commentary and exegesis have emerged since antiquity, each holding to their own interpretations. Yet the finest are those whose words and logic are comprehensive and coherent; if meaning is obscured or reasoning flawed, even elegant phrasing is of no worth.\n\nMaster Wēi Dàyǒu of Xū River, upright and resolute in his purpose, examined the works of all schools, selecting the most excellent to compile into this collection. He sought to have it engraved and printed for transmission, his diligence commendable. If those who truly savor its meaning seek beyond the words and embody it in body and mind, then the Dao of preserving life’s essence will flourish within, and the affairs of governance and harmony will manifest without.\n\nIs the Dao divided? At his request, I thus presume to inscribe this preface.\n\nIn the year *Zhāoyáng*, the *wǔ* year of the *Dīng* cycle, on the *zhōu* day of the twelfth month, the 43rd-generation Celestial Master, Zhang Yǔchū, a disciple of the Three Caverns, respectfully composes this preface.\n\nThe *Daode Jing* is the ancestral scripture of our Dao. Its essence is *wuwei* (non-action, naturalness), its practice is *humility, retreat, kindness, and frugality*, and within it are all the methods for cultivation, governance, and harmonization—none are lacking.\n\nThe True Person Gé Xuān said: The five thousand words are the very source of *Daode*, encompassing all that is vast without exclusion, all that is minute without omission—the natural scripture of Heaven and humanity.\n\nMaster Ni Wénjié said: The five thousand words of Laozi are indeed the essential method for self-cultivation and governance, the finest remedy for saving the age and benefiting the world.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that it is not merely the ancestral scripture of the Dao—how could the scriptures of the Three Teachings (Daoism, Confucianism, Buddhism) possess any other principle apart from this?\n\nIn the present age of sage and enlightened rule, it is especially revered, and a Daoist Bureau has been established to oversee its teachings. Future scholars must first master its doctrines before receiving ordination certificates. Yet alas, the world is in decline, and even its reading is unknown—how much less its meaning?\n\nMaster Wēi Dàyǒu, during his leisure from ritual duties, compared the commentaries of various schools, which sometimes differed, sometimes aligned, with merits and flaws alike. Scholars could not help but be confused. Thus, he gathered the interpretations of *Hé Shànggōng* and *Hé Xīnshān* and over ten other schools, selecting those whose elucidations were detailed and clear, whose logic was sound and consistent without strain, compiling them into two volumes—*The Daode Jing with Collected Meanings*—so that future scholars might know the definitive interpretation and avoid confusion from conflicting views.\n\nAs for those who, through understanding the meaning, illuminate the scripture, and through the scripture, construct the Dao, finding joy in the practice of *wuwei*—such persons are not absent.\n\nIn the year *Dīngmǎo* of the *Hóngwǔ* era, Master Wēi Dàyǒu of Xū River, incense burning, respectfully records this.\n\n**Names of the Commentators in the *Collected Meanings***\n*Hé Shànggōng* (Riverbank Master), also known as *Hé Shàng Zhàngrén* (Riverbank Old Man).",

From it arise the two polarities (*èryī*), and all things derive their form. It cannot truly be named, yet we forcibly call it *Dao*. Thus, the opening line rightly begins with *Dao* alone, standing apart—just as in the passage *\"The Dao is boundless, yet it acts\"* (Chapter 4), where *Dao* is first proclaimed in reverence. By this, we see its supreme height and boundless greatness. Since the Dao establishes its name, both are declared together.\n\nThe lines *\"The Dao that can be spoken\"* and *\"The name that can be named\"* refer to the Dao’s methods being divided among the world, and names serving as their markers. *\"The eternal Dao and eternal name\"* speak of the void generating nature spontaneously, nature generating the Dao, and the ineffable beyond naming. If the Dao is truly eternal, then its name is eternal as well. What can be spoken and named are but temporary expressions. To say *\"can\"* implies both possibility and impossibility—how then can it be eternal? This is the paradox of forced naming. To say *\"eternal\"* denies both possibility and impossibility—how then can it change? This is the natural way of things.\n\nThe Dao is its essence; the name is its function. Both existence (*yǒu*) and nonexistence (*wú*) are names. The Dao originates in nonexistence—vast and empty—thus naming the beginning of Heaven and Earth. Things arise from existence—vibrant and flourishing—thus naming the mother of all things.\n\n**Commentary by Lǐ Zhī:**\nThe Dao is the void and natural, the eternal Way. Originally, it cannot be spoken of; the Dao that *can* be spoken is not the eternal Dao. The primal *qi* of origins transforms into all heavens, adapting to time and change. The Dao itself is formless; the names we give it are not its true names. Heaven and Earth move and transform, nurturing all things, manifesting in tangible forms and names.\n\n**Commentary by Lín Zhī:**\nThe Dao cannot be put into words. The moment speech is applied, it falls into the second order of meaning. Thus, one must observe it without desire to grasp its subtlety, and with desire to perceive its boundaries. Though these two approaches differ in name, they both arise from the same source and are called *Xuan* (mysterious).\n\n**Commentary by Hé Zhī (continued):**\n*\"Constant nonexistence\"* is not absolute nonexistence—it has always been so, hence *\"constant.\"* As in *The Liezi*: *\"The Great Ease\"* saw no *qi*; *\"The Great Beginning\"* was the start of *qi*; *\"The Great Commencement\"* was the start of form; *\"The Great Purity\"* was the start of substance. Following this sequence leads to confusion, hence it is called *\"mixed and indistinct.\"* Observing it in nonexistence reveals its profound mystery.\n\n*\"Constant existence\"* is not temporary existence—it is always so, hence *\"constant.\"* As in *The Liezi*: *\"The Ease transforms into Oneness; Oneness transforms into Seven; Seven transforms into Nine; Nine transforms back into Oneness.\"* Oneness is the beginning of form. It is also said: *\"When there is form, it returns to formlessness.\"* Observing it in existence reveals its inevitable return. The character *jiào* (徼) in both Laozi and Liezi commentaries means *\"return\"*—the return to its resting place. As in *The Zhuangzi*: *\"To reach the void and fulfill one’s seeking, to roam freely and grasp its end.\"* Here, the one and the none are observed together, and only what one does not seek to observe is not the Dao.\n\nThese two approaches share the same origin but differ in name. The *Daode Jing* states: *\"All things under Heaven arise from existence; existence arises from nonexistence.\"* Thus, their origin is the same, though their names differ. The subtle nonexistence is not nonexistence; the manifest existence is not existence. Hence, *\"The eternal can make the nonexistent exist; the nonexistent can make the eternal manifest.\"* Existence and nonexistence share the same name as *\"eternal,\"* thus both are called *Xuan*. Existence and nonexistence are one; nonexistence is inherently *Xuan*, and existence is also *Xuan*, hence *\"they are the same in mystery.\"* The *Daode Jing* says: *\"All things arise together; I observe their return.\"* The three observations—*\"subtle,\" \"boundaries,\"* and *\"return\"*—later reveal that *\"return\"* encompasses both *\"subtle\"* and *\"boundaries.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Lín Zhī (continued):**\nThe lines *\"constant nonexistence, constant existence\"* teach the ultimate realization. The word *\"desire\"* here carries deep meaning—it signifies *\"seeking.\"* One seeks this ultimate truth. Though existence and nonexistence appear as two, they share the same source despite differing names. If one constantly observes both nonexistence and existence, they are both called *Xuan*. *Xuan* is the marvel of creation. By observing thus, Laozi does not exclusively uphold emptiness. If he did, he would not say *\"they share the same source\"* or *\"both are called Xuan.\"*\n\n**Commentary by Ní Zhī:**\nExistence and nonexistence are both eternal aspects of the Dao. *\"Constant nonexistence\"* is the Dao before manifestation; *\"constant existence\"* is the Dao in manifestation. The Dao is eternally nonexistent yet eternally existent—existence and nonexistence generate each other and cannot be separated. The Dao’s nonexistence invites observation of its subtlety—the refined essence within. The Dao’s existence invites observation of its boundaries—the coarse manifestations at its edges. The world mistakenly claims Laozi speaks only of nonexistence, yet in this opening chapter, he presents both existence and nonexistence equally, never favoring one over the other. This reveals his intent in composing the text. Many commentators mistakenly split the lines into *\"without desire\"* and *\"with desire.\"* Desire is the obstruction of the Dao—without it, one may proceed. How could there ever be *\"with desire\"*?",

      "translated_text": "「○ Master Lü said: To observe the subtle is to gaze within. The subtle is the divine—divine in its transformation of all things, yet expressed through speech. Thus, the practice of inward observation restrains the restless mind, halts the cravings of desire, gathers the divine radiance, consolidates the pure *qi*, and solidifies the embryonic true essence.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* of the Supreme Sage contains the methods of inward and fixed observation, while the *Dao* of immortals and true ones teaches the techniques of *shōushì fǎn tīng* (withdrawing sight and reversing hearing). The *Zhēnjié* states: Inward observation is the root of spiritual immortality. *Jiào* (boundaries) refers to the edges and limits, as well as to the return (to the source).\n\n○ Master Dong said: All that is distant and without ultimate reach must be profound in hue—its essence is the boundless depth of the human heart, where no form is manifest. This is the meaning of *yānmò* (profound silence) in the *Guan Yin Zi*—the unmeasurable, the indivisible. Thus, he speaks of *Tiān* (Heaven), *Mìng* (Fate), *Shén* (Divine), and *Xuán* (Mysterious), all converging in the term *Dao* (Way).\n\n○ Some say: Why do all the schools interpret the passage as *\"constant nonexistence\"* and *\"constant existence with desire\"* when you alone take *\"constant nonexistence and constant existence\"*? I say: The schools’ interpretation is not without logic, but it fails to align with the deeper *Xuán* (Mysterious) meaning of the subsequent text. If existence is paired with desire, how can it be called *Xuán*? Again, those who cling to desire perish themselves—yet to perish is to attain *Xuán*, is this possible?\n\nAnother school suggests that *\"constant existence with desire\"* refers to the practice of skillful application, which is not without brilliance, yet it is also overly strained.\n\nIt is better to take *\"constant nonexistence and constant existence\"* as absolute—simple yet profound in meaning. Thus, I adhere to this reading.\n\n*\"Mysterious yet again mysterious—\nthe gateway to all subtleties.\"*\n\n○ Master He said: The subtleties are indeed subtle, yet the boundaries are also subtle—hence, *\"all subtleties.\"* The gateway refers to their origin. Many read this chapter only in terms of Heaven and Earth, yet the Sage’s intent is to be grasped from the heart.\n\n○ Master Lü said: The *Xuán* (Mysterious) is the ultimate of subtlety. Again, *Xuán* is Heaven—*Xuán* within *Xuán* is Heaven within Heaven. The *Yùluó Xiāotái* (Jade Tower of Obscurity), the *Yùshān Shàngjīng* (Jade Mountain Upper Palace), in the human body are the Heavenly Valleys and Divine Precincts of the brain and blood. They are the crystalline chamber of vital fluids, the source of the essence, and the dwelling of the hundred spirits—where the Great Lord of Self-Sustaining Life resides. When one observes with the divine essence the Heaven within Heaven, the embryonic immortality forms itself, the Heavenly Gate opens, and all spirits enter and exit through it. Hence, it is called *\"the gateway to all subtleties.\"*\n\n○ Master Chái said: The unfolding and closing of *Yīn* and *Yáng* (the cosmic forces), the emergence and retreat of essence and function—what more does this gate encompass?\n\n○ Master Liú said: *\"Mysterious yet again mysterious\"* speaks of the origin of all things in their natural state—this is the gateway through which all subtleties pass. This chapter first discusses the *Dao*, then Heaven and Earth, and finally the human heart—it is now complete. Scholars should reflect upon it in silence.\n\n○ Master Dong said: Both principle and phenomenon arise from this gate—hence, *\"the gateway to all subtleties.\"*\n\n**Chapter Two:**\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nthen it is ugliness.\nWhen all under Heaven know goodness as goodness,\nthen it is not goodness.\n\n○ Master He said: The *Dao* is formless yet all-encompassing, a symbol without substance. It molds and transforms, and thus all the beauty of Heaven and Earth is contained within it. The interplay of *Yīn* and *Yáng* (cosmic forces) nurtures virtue and completes nature—those who know this are better off forgetting what they know. How much more so when all under Heaven claim to know it!\n\nThus, to know beauty as beauty is not as good as to not know it as beauty—this is the ultimate beauty.\nWhen people know what is beautiful, beauty harbors ugliness, for their knowledge is shallow.\nTo know goodness as goodness is not as good as to not know it as goodness—this is the ultimate goodness.\nWhen people know what is good, goodness harbors not-goodness, for their knowledge is superficial.\n\n○ Master Lü said: The sage who embodies the *Dao* and fulfills virtue blends with all things, equal to their natural state. When all under Heaven know his beauty as beauty, I do not know it as beauty; when they know his goodness as goodness, I do not know it as goodness. In perfect harmony with all things, transcending duality, how could there be beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness?\n\nThe world fails to awaken to the truth that things were not always manifest. Lost in private perception, some take appearance, sound, and color as beauty, while others take wealth and honor as goodness. Once the deluded mind arises, they may praise what is ugly or what is not goodness. What is now rejected may later be embraced; what was once approved may now be condemned. Then, what choice is there between beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness?\n\n○ Master Wú said: The names of beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness, arise in relation to one another. Because ugliness exists, beauty exists; because not-goodness exists, goodness exists. When all know this as beauty, then that is ugliness; when all know this as goodness, then that is not-goodness. To erase both, to return them to the void, then neither beauty nor ugliness, goodness nor not-goodness, exists.\n\n○ Master Lín said: This chapter embodies the meaning of *\"having yet not dwelling\"*—when beauty is known, ugliness arises; when goodness is known, not-goodness arises. Beauty unknown as beauty, goodness unknown as goodness—then there is no ugliness, no not-goodness.\n\nThus, existence and nonexistence generate each other,\ndifficulty and ease complete each other,\nlong and short define each other,\nhigh and low depend on each other,\nsounds and responses harmonize each other,\nbefore and after follow each other.\n\n○ Master He said: To speak of nonexistence is to imply existence;\nto speak of existence is to imply nonexistence—this is their generation.\nDifficulty arises from ease,\nease is shaped by difficulty—this is their completion.\nA foot may be short where a cubit is long,\na high bank becomes a valley—this is their interdependence.\nThe crane’s call is answered by its mate,\nas sounds and responses follow one another—\njust as before and after, goodness and not-goodness,\nbeauty and ugliness, stand in constant opposition under Heaven.\nThe shallow in knowledge and perception,\nknowing beauty and goodness,\nare not as good as those who do not recognize them—\nthis is the ultimate goodness and beauty.\n\n○ Master Lǐ said: Existence arises from nonexistence,\nnonexistence arises from existence.\nDifficulty transforms into ease,\nease transforms into difficulty.\nThe long brings forth the short,\nthe short brings forth the long.\nOnce there is high, there must be low—\nsounds must harmonize in response,\nbefore must follow after, after must follow before.\nThus, existence and nonexistence,\ndifficulty and ease,\nare mutually dependent.\nBeauty brings forth ugliness,\ngoodness brings forth not-goodness.»",

      "translated_text": "○ **Master Lü said:** Once the Two Principles [Yin-Yang] are established, all things exist in pairs, thus they generate one another through existence and nonexistence, perfect one another through difficulty and ease, take form through long and short, incline through high and low, harmonize through sound, and follow through before and after—all motion arises from deliberate action.\n\n○ **Master Lin said:** These six sentences all illustrate the meaning of beauty and ugliness, goodness and not-goodness from above.\n\n○ **Ouyang Xiu said:** The following of before and after, the forming of long and short—when extended broadly, this is the principle of all things.\n\nThough the *Dao De Jing* speaks as if of emptiness and nothingness, its teachings on governing the people are profound indeed. Therefore, the Sage acts in non-action and governs through silent instruction.\n\n○ **Master He said:** The Sage knows nonexistence and grasps the pivotal mechanism of knowledge, thus while others engage in affairs, the Sage dwells in non-affairs, finding amusement in the interplay of things—what concern does the Sage have for affairs?\n\nOthers speak endlessly, yet the Sage practices speechless speech. Though never uttering words, standing beside others, the Sage transforms them—what concern does the Sage have for speech?\n\n○ **Master Lü said:** Existence and nonexistence, difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, sound and voice, before and after—though these exist in pairs, they inevitably entail entanglement. Thus, the Sage abandons things and departs from people, standing alone above all things, not pairing with anything. As the *Classic* says: *\"Standing alone yet unchanging, nothing can pair with it.\"* Therefore, the Sage practices non-action, does nothing, forgets speech and forgets images, silently resonating with Nature—how could such a one rely on mere sounds?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* speaks of the utmost action as departing from action, the utmost speech as departing from speech—hence, *\"The Sage acts in non-action and governs through silent instruction.\"*\n\nAll things arise yet the Sage does not claim them, they are born yet the Sage does not possess them, the Sage acts yet does not rely on it, completing the work yet does not dwell upon it. Only because the Sage does not dwell upon it does it never depart.\n\n○ **Master He said:** The Sage acts, and all things observe; all things act, yet how could the Sage refuse responsibility for their arising? Though the Sage does not claim them as possession or rely upon them, the work belongs to the Sage—this cannot be rejected, for it is inevitable, not the Sage’s intention.\n\n○ **Master Lin said:** Heaven and Earth generate ten thousand transformations without ceasing—how could they refuse their labor? All things fill Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth never claim possession. As spring brings life and autumn brings death, yet Nature never boasts of its power—thus, *\"They are born yet the Sage does not possess them, acts yet does not rely on it.\"* The meaning lies in completing the work yet not dwelling upon it, hence these three phrases illuminate it.\n\n*\"Action\"* is akin to the *Yijing*’s *\"Kun\"* nurturing all things—this is the meaning of Shun and Yu ruling without claiming ownership. Those who possess what they have cannot truly possess it; those who do not possess what they have can truly possess it. The *Book of Documents* says: *\"Having virtue, yet losing it.\"* Thus, *\"Only because the Sage does not dwell upon it does it never depart.\"*\n\n○ **Master Li said:** Not refusing, not possessing, not relying, not dwelling—each forgets the other, and existence and nonexistence stand annulled. Thus, the True One endures eternally and never departs.\n\n○ **Master Lü said:** The Sage embodies the Dao within, yet his mind labors not; his responses to things are without measure. Thus, all things arise together, and he responds spontaneously—like a valley echoing sound, beauty and ugliness alike come to him without refusal. Hence, *\"All things arise together yet the Sage does not refuse.\"*\n\nSelf-formed, self-colored, self-generated, self-transformed—each fulfills its small or great nature, completing its essence. Who possesses it?\n\nThe *Guan Yinzi* says: *\"Things are not mine, yet I cannot but respond; I am not myself, yet I cannot but nourish.\"* Thus, responding to things yet never possessing them, nourishing oneself yet never possessing oneself—hence, *\"They are born yet the Sage does not possess them.\"*\n\nBenefiting ten thousand generations yet not claiming it as benevolence, covering Heaven and Earth yet not claiming it as greatness—hence, *\"The Sage acts yet does not rely on it.\"* The work covers the world yet seems not to emerge from the Sage; to acknowledge it would be confusion—hence, *\"The work is complete yet the Sage does not dwell upon it.\"*\n\nIf there is dwelling, there is departure—this is true of past and present. Within oneself, there is no dwelling; thus, things cannot displace it.\n\nOnly because the Sage does not dwell upon it, does not possess it, does not rely on it—thus, soaring with things above all things yet remaining unchanged, never departing.\n\n○ **Master Wu said:** *\"Action\"* refers to things about to arise. Not refusing, not possessing, not relying, not dwelling—these are the non-actions of Heaven and Earth. Not departing means enduring forever. Heaven and Earth do not dwell upon completing their work, thus their work endures eternally and never departs.\n\n○ **Master Dong said:** This chapter guides learners to a place where name and trace are both forgotten.\n\n**Chapter Three:**\nDo not exalt the worthy, so the people do not contend.\nDo not treasure rare goods, so the people do not become thieves.\nDo not display what is desirable, so the heart does not become disordered.\n\n○ **Master Li said:** If one does not boast of one’s own virtue, the people become pure. If one does not treasure rare goods, the people become wealthy. If one does not display what is desirable, the heart becomes settled.\n\n○ **Master Wu said:** *\"Exalt\"* means to honor; *\"treasure\"* means to value highly; *\"display\"* is akin to showing. If one does not exalt, does not treasure, it is as if one does not show what is desirable, thus the people’s hearts do not contend. Not becoming thieves is the same as not becoming disordered.\n\n○ **Master Lin said:** *\"Exalt\"* is the same as *\"boast.\"* If I boast of my virtue, then contention will arise throughout the world. Yu alone did not boast, and thus no one contended with him—this is the meaning.\n\nIf I value rare goods as treasures, then all people will have desires to obtain them, and their ruin will lead to theft. Only if one does not show what is desirable will the heart naturally settle.\n\nTherefore, the Sage empties the mind, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones.\n\n○ **Master Li said:** *\"Empty the mind\"* is to preserve one’s nature. *\"Fill the belly\"* is to preserve one’s life.",

      "translated_text": "Weakening the will, this is to preserve the spirit. Strengthening the bones, this is to preserve the form.\n\n○ **Master Lü said:** Earlier, it was said that one should not value rare goods, not show what is desirable—this is the same as emptying the mind. Not exalting virtue is the same as weakening the will. If one says only that the mind must be emptied, there is fear of sinking into dull emptiness. If one says only that the will must be weakened, there is fear of failing to stand firm. Therefore, the Sage’s cultivation of the self must include emptying the mind, filling the belly, weakening the will, and strengthening the bones. The empty must be paired with the full, the weak with the strong. A luminous spirit hall clears and brightens; a vacant chamber generates purity—untainted by a single speck of dust—this is emptying the mind. Once emptied, if one cannot inhale and exhale the Great Harmony, chew the essence of *Hāngzǐ*, drink the motherless *Xuānyīng*, or consume the celestial *Tiānguān* of the Great *Dàfán*, how can one fill the belly? Merely guarding the emptiness of nature—how could one then transcend the mortal coil, ascend in broad daylight?\n\nThus, it is clear that emptying the mind and filling the belly must not be neglected.\n\nTo humble oneself and remain lowly, to govern oneself with meekness—this is weakening the will. Though the will is weakened, if one cannot speak of the Dao in action, there will be nothing to establish oneself upon. How then could one achieve what the *Yijing* says: *\"Heaven’s movement is vigorous; the superior man strengthens himself with unremitting effort\"*? Those who refine internally may twist and turn against the flow, ascending through the Three Passes to nourish the brain—when the brain is full, the bones grow strong. Weakening the will and strengthening the bones must not be neglected—this is also clear.\n\n○ **Master He said:** Emptying the mind is purifying the origin and transcending the root. Filling the belly is accumulating essence and piling up *qi*. Separating the principles of emptiness and fullness, the spirit is preserved. Weakening the will is concentrating *qi* to achieve softness. Strengthening the bones is hearing the Dao and diligently practicing it. Following the yielding of *Kūn* and the vigor of *Qián*, virtue is preserved.\n\n○ **Master Chái said:** If one does not exalt oneself, does not value goods, and has no desires, then the mind naturally becomes empty and luminous, and the belly’s *qi* naturally fills. When the mind is empty of all things, the will becomes gentle and harmonious. When the belly is nourished, the bones grow strong. If one constantly keeps the people without knowledge or desire, then those who are wise dare not act. To act without action is to govern without failing.\n\n○ **Master He said:** When spirit and virtue are both complete, there is naturally a transformation without words, guiding the people without their knowing it. What was once known is now forgotten; what was once desired is now abandoned. As *Zhuangzi* says: *\"In harmony with the unknown, virtue does not depart. In harmony with the desireless, this is called pristine simplicity.\"* When the people return to their natural simplicity, how could they dare to act selfishly or scheme for others? The common people dare not act; the ruler acts without action. The subtle effect of perfect governance leaves no trace to follow.\n\n○ **Master Lin said:** In ancient times, the people were pure and simple, knowing nothing, desiring nothing. Though some among them had clever and scheming minds, even if their knowledge took root, they dared not act upon it. The Sage governs the world in this way. The Sage, in the world, has no place for the mind. In governance, all is done through *wuwei*, and thus nothing remains ungoverned.\n\n○ **Master Lü said:** *Wuwei* is the Dao. The Sage proclaims the Dao from above, and the people respond in harmony from below. Morning and evening, in times of chaos or order, the Dao is the only path. Without the Dao, one does not act; without the Dao, one does not speak. All actions must align with the Dao of *wuwei*. If one acts with deliberate action, the mind labors and the body grows weary, ending in exhaustion. But if one acts through *wuwei*—even if one consumes elixirs of refined essence, breathes celestial *qi*, rinses and swallows cloudy nectar, or refines the mysterious pearl—ascending to the heavens and coiling upon the earth, wielding marvelous transformations, with the body perfectly attuned—then it is said: *\"To act without action is to govern without failing.\"*\n\n○ **Master Dòng said:** This chapter speaks of forgetting exalted virtues, erasing thought, and returning to *wuwei* in harmony with the ultimate truth.\n\n**Chapter Four**\nThe Dao is boundless yet applied—sometimes it does not fill.\nDeep as the source of all things.\n\n○ **Master Wú said:** *\"Or\"* is a word of doubt, not certainty. The Dao’s essence is empty; those who use the Dao must also remain empty and unfilled. If filled, it is no longer the Dao. *\"Deep\"* means unfathomable. *\"Source\"* is the ancestral root, the lineage’s foundation. The Dao is the foundation of all things, hence *\"the source of all things.\"* *\"Seems\"* is another word of doubt, used in praise.\n\n○ **Master He said:** *\"Boundless\"* means empty. The Dao’s highest use lies in its emptiness. *Zhuangzi* knew that only when one understands the useless can one speak of use. If filled, the center is not empty, and its use is limited. *\"Seems\"*—how difficult it is to speak of it directly! This is the utmost emptiness.\n\n○ **Master Lin said:** *\"Boundless\"* means empty. Though the Dao’s essence is empty, its application is inexhaustible—sometimes filled, sometimes not, adapting to the moment. *\"Seems\"* is a word of doubt used in praise. *\"The source of all things\"* is what *Zhuangzi* called the Great Master.\n\n○ **Master Lǐ said:** *\"The Dao is boundless yet applied—sometimes it does not fill\"* means not being self-satisfied. Those who are not self-satisfied will inevitably benefit, blunting sharpness and resolving conflicts through the emptiness of the center and forgetting the self.\n\n○ **Master Lü said:** Heaven’s first creation is water, whose use lies in the center, hence *\"boundless.\"* The character for *\"boundless\"* combines water and center, speaking of the true One’s water within *qi*. This is called *\"boundless.\"* Boundless is *qi*; boundless is harmony. The True Person of Jin Hua said: *\"Boundless harmony enters the body to vitalize; the spirit of the grain knows the boundless use of ascension to Kunlun.\"* This is the true speech of the Dao’s boundless application. Yan Junping said: *\"Boundless takes emptiness as its dwelling; harmony takes non-action as its home. Using emptiness and non-being, one naturally avoids excess.\"*",

Yu alone did not boast, and thus no one contended with him—this is the meaning.\n\nIf I value rare goods as treasures, then all people will have desires to obtain them, and their ruin will lead to theft. Only if one does not show what is desirable will the heart naturally settle.\n\nTherefore, the Sage empties the mind, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones.\n\n○ **Master Li said:** *\"Empty the mind\"* is to preserve one’s nature. *\"Fill the belly\"* is to preserve one’s life.",

exhaustion.\nBetter to remain silent and forget speech,\nas Confucius said:\n*“I wish to speak not at all—\nwhat words could Heaven have?\nThe four seasons pass in their course,\nand all things are born from them.”*\nThis is the very meaning.\n\n○ Master Li said:\nThis chapter concludes the meaning of *chōng* (emptiness) and its application.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, it is like the *túshuǐ*—\nits emptiness within,\nits unyielding stillness—\nno mind.\nWhen moved, it yields ever more—\nendless responsiveness to change.\n“Better to guard the center”\nis nothing but this emptiness within.\n\n○ Master Lǚ’s text records:\nThe True Person of the Marvelous Dao asked Laozi:\n*“What is the most essential chapter for cultivating the Dao and refining the body?”*\nLaozi replied:\n*“It is ‘Guarding the Center, Embracing the One, Deep Roots, Firm Foundation.’”*\nThe True Person asked:\n*“What is meant by ‘guarding the center’?”*\nLaozi said:\n*“The center is the Central Palace.\nConsider the infant in the womb—\nits navel cord connects to the mother’s,\ndrawing her *qi* in darkness.\nWhen she inhales, it inhales;\nwhen she exhales, it exhales.\nFor ten months, its *qi* is full, its spirit complete.\nAt birth, it detaches from the cord—\njust as a fruit, once ripe, falls from the tree.\nThe space three inches deep between the navel is called the Central Palace,\nalso the Yellow Court.\nIn men, it is the *Qi Sea*;\nin women, the womb.\nI was once taught by the Dao Sovereign of the Highest:\n‘Diligently guard the center,\nnever let it stray.\nKeep the outer from entering,\nthe inner from escaping.\nReturn to the Original Source—\nall matters will then be complete.’\n‘Diligently guard the center’ means\nfixing one’s mind on the Original Sea.\n‘Not letting it escape’ means\nletting the breath’s coming and going\nsettle naturally within the Central Palace,\nnever letting it disperse outward.\n‘Returning to the Original Source’ means\nthe navel is the origin of twelve thousand five hundred breaths,\nthe root of the *qi* for the five *zàng* and six *fǔ*.\nBy returning the breath to its source\nand guiding it with the spirit,\none makes the breath steady and still.’*\n\n**Chapter Six: The Immortal Valley-Spirit, Called the Mysterious Female**\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\n*“Valley”* refers to Heaven’s Valley,\n*“spirit”* to the original spirit of the body.\nHeaven’s Valley contains the transformations,\nholds the void and emptiness;\nEarth’s Valley contains all things,\nbears mountains and rivers.\nHumans, sharing the same origin as Heaven and Earth,\nalso possess a Valley.\nWithin it dwells the True One,\nthe abode of the original spirit.\nThus, the head has nine palaces,\ncorresponding to the nine heavens.\nThe central palace is called the *Níwán* (Mud Ball),\nalso the Purple Treasury.\nBeyond the nine palaces lies another,\nwith many names:\n*Liáotiān* (Boundless Heaven),\n*Tiānguān* (Heavenly Pass),\n*Yùjīngshān* (Jade Capital Mountain),\n*Kūnlún’s Peak*,\n*Tàyuān Pool*,\nand *Tiāngǔ* (Heavenly Valley)—\nthe palace where the original spirit resides.\nIts emptiness is like a valley,\nand the spirit dwells within—\nthus it is called the *Valley-Spirit*.\nWhen the spirit remains, life continues;\nwhen it departs, death follows.\nEven during the day, as one interacts with things,\nor at night, when lost in dreams,\nthe spirit is unsettled in its dwelling.\nIf it leaves and does not return,\nwandering without return,\nthen the path of life and death is severed.\nThus, it is said:\nHumans cannot live without the spirit’s life,\nnor die without the spirit’s death.\nYet the Valley-Spirit does not die—\nbecause of the *Mysterious Female*.\n\n*Xuán* (Mysterious) is the Yang,\nHeaven.\n*Pìn* (Female) is the Yin,\nEarth.\nThe Mysterious is Heaven’s color—\npure Yang, the void *qi* of emptiness,\nlight and clear, floating in Heaven.\nIts character is composed of *wú* (none) and *huǒ* (fire),\narising from the void,\ndwelling in the Mysterious Original Palace—\nthus it is called *Mysterious*.\nThe Female is Earth’s nature—\npure Yin, the substantial *qi* of the valley,\nheavy and turbid, sinking into Earth.\nIts character is composed of *qì* (breath) and *mǐ* (rice),\narising from substance,\ndwelling in the Female Original Treasury—\nthus it is called *Female*.\nThe two *qi* rise and fall between inhalation and exhalation.\nThere is a method to regulate them:\nReverse their natural flow,\nso that Yin does not grow excessive,\nand restore their origin,\nso that Yang does not weaken.\nTransform the having into the void,\nthe void into having—\nusing the substantial *qi* of the Original Earth\nto ascend and expel it,\nand the void *qi* of Heaven’s Original\nto descend and return it.\nWhen Heaven’s *qi* returns to the body,\nthe turbid Yin naturally dissipates,\nrestoring one to pure Yang.\nThus it is said:\n*“Return the Heavenly *qi* above\nto govern the nine heavens’ souls.”*\nTherefore, the Mysterious Female’s two *qi*\neach hold profound meaning—\nunless one meets a sage\nwho transmits oral instructions,\nthey cannot be known.\nIf one knows the origin of the two *qi*,\nthen one knows the mystery of the Mysterious Female.\nNourish the *Tàihé* (Great Harmony),\ninherit the *Qi Mother*,\nto nourish the spirit.\nThe spirit depends on its darkness,\nreturning to the Valley—\nthus it does not die.\nIs this not the function of the Mysterious Female?\nThus it is said:\n*“The Valley-Spirit does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Female.”*\nFrom the *Língshū Shénjǐng Neijing*:\n*“Heaven’s Valley, the original spirit—\nguard it, and it will remain true.\nAbove and below, the Mysterious Female—\nchild and mother in harmony.”*\nIt is also said:\n*“The Mysterious Female is the vessel of Heaven and Earth;\nseize it with the spirit,\nobtain it with the true—\nthe way of ascent and descent.”*\n\n○ Master Hé said:\n*“Valley”* is emptiness,\nthe dwelling of the spirit.\nFrom vigor to old age to death,\nthe spirit scatters from dissipation,\nyet people do not know to rest quietly and nourish it.\nEven if one sits in repose all day,\nif the mind wanders outward,\nthe Valley will not be empty,\nthe spirit will not remain—\nhow then can one avoid death?\nOnly by seeking the essence in the profound darkness,\nseeking things in the hazy uncertainty,\nwith form and spirit merging perfectly,\nuniting with the Dao’s truth,\ncan one achieve longevity.\n*Xuán* is Heaven—emptiness;\n*Pìn* is Earth—stillness.\nIf one accumulates emptiness to communicate with the spirit,\nattains stillness to nourish the true,\nthen the Dao of the Mysterious Female’s immortality is realized.\n\n○ Master Li said:\n*“The Valley-Spirit does not die”—\nthe void and spirit remain unobscured.\n*The Mysterious Female*—\none Yin, one Yang.",

      "translated_text": "「The Gate of the Mysterious Female,\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nMaster Lü said:\nSince the Mysterious Female’s essence is defined by ascent and

(明堂),\nwhich extends downward to the nostrils,\nhence the nostrils are the *Gate of the Mysterious Female*.\nThe nostrils connect the Six Palaces (六府) with the passage of *qi*,\nwhere the light and subtle *qi* interfaces with Heaven,\nthus it is called the *Heavenly Root*.\n\nAbove the *Mystery of the Primordial Mother* (牝元宮) lies the *Yellow Court* (黃庭),\nwhich ascends through the *Heavy Chamber* (重楼) to the mouth,\nhence the mouth is the *Gate of the Mysterious Female*.\nThe mouth connects the Five Organs (五臟) with the passage of *qi*,\nwhere the heavy and turbid *qi* interfaces with Earth,\nthus it is called the *Earthly Root*.\n\nThe common folk do not exhaust its source,\nnor probe its origin,\nand so they merely call the nostrils *Mysterious Female* (玄)\nand the mouth *Primordial Mother* (牝).\nThen what else could the *Gate of the Mysterious Female* be named?\nThis is due to their failure to grasp its subtlety.\n\n○ Master He said:\nWhen emptiness is perfected and stillness is steadfastly maintained,\nentering through this Gate,\nthe roots of Heaven and Earth are fully attained.\n\nHeaven bestows *qi*, Earth bestows *jing* (精),\nwhen gathered, they form spirit—\nthis is their root.\nIf the root is not plucked,\nthen life may endure long.\nHence it is said: *\"My life lies in me, not in Heaven and Earth,\"*\nand again: *\"I share one breath of *qi* with Heaven and Earth,\ngoverning myself by preserving the root—this is the Way.\"*\n\n○ Master Ni said:\n*Mysterious Female* (玄) is the Yang—\nthe *Heavenly Stem* (乾).\n*Primordial Mother* (牝) is the Yin—\nthe *Earthly Receptacle* (坤).\nThe *Gate* is the path of emergence and return,\nthe opening and closing of *Heavenly Stem* and *Earthly Receptacle*.\nThe *Root* is like the root of a tree—\nthe

Yin.\nThe *Gate* is the keyhole of the two *qi*—\nas the previous chapter says: *\"the Gate of all wonders,\"*\nand as the saying goes: *\"Who can exit without passing through the door?\nWhy not follow this Way?\"*\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth existed,\nthe *Original Breath* (元氣) was first—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nContinuous and unceasing,\nit is used without

haste;\nif they are left unrestrained, they lose it to turbulence—\nboth are incorrect.\nTo achieve true continuity without interruption,\nas if present yet not present,\nas if absent yet not absent,\nthe true breath arrives at perfect equilibrium,\nlike the turtle’s retreat,\nlike the serpent’s repose—\nnever reaching exhaustion or urgency.\n\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* (莊子) says:\n*\"The ancient

interruption.\n*Store*—\nspirit’s abiding presence.\n*Exhaust*—\nlabor and depletion.\nIf *qi* is used with ease, it nurtures and grows daily;\nif *qi* is used with agitation, it is consumed and depleted.\nThe statement that spirit endures within,\nthen *qi* is not exhausted.\n\n○ Master Li said:\n*\"One closing, one opening—\na ceaseless flow,\nno one knows its measure.\nIn motion and stillness, no confusion,\nno strain of effort,\neternally generating and transforming.\"*\n\nThe *Lièzǐ* (列子) fully records this chapter,\nand then says: *\"The Yellow Emperor’s Book

themselves—\nthus they endure long.\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nHeaven and Earth are unified in generating things,\nyet do not generate themselves.\nThe scripture says:\n*\"Generating yet not possessing,\nenduring yet not controlling—\nthis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\"*\nAll speak of Heaven and Earth not generating themselves,\nyet being able to endure long—\nthus it is said:\n*\"Ample and profound—\nthus they bear things;\nHigh and luminous—\nthus they cover things;\nEndless and enduring—\nthus they complete things.\"*\nThe three phrases all concern generating things,\nyet do not mention Heaven and Earth generating themselves.\n\n○ Master Li said:\nHeaven does not generate Heaven,\nEarth does not generate Earth—\nthus life does not cease.\n\n○ Master Lín said:\nThis chapter uses Heaven and Earth to illustrate\nthe sage’s lack of contrivance.\nHeaven and Earth generate all things,\nnaturally and effortlessly,\nwithout contrivance—\nthus ten thousand years are like one day.\n\nTherefore, the sage places his body last yet it is first,\nplaces his body externally yet it endures—\nnot because he has no selfish desires,\nbut because he fulfills them.\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nThe sage aligns with Heaven and Earth without boundary,\naccepts the bearing and covering with selflessness,\nlaboring for the world.\nIs it not because Heaven and Earth share the same root with me,\nand all things share the same body with me?\nAll take what is before themselves,\nbut I alone take what is after—\nby taking what is after, others are placed before.\nAll take what is solid for themselves,\nbut I alone take what is empty—\nmy form is placed externally,\nwhile the Way is preserved within.\n\nAnd again:\n*\"The sage takes the Dao as his body,\nyet has no body—\nwhat selfishness could there be?\nThis is how he harmonizes with Heaven and Earth without end.\"*\n\n○ Master Wú said:\n*Placing last*—\nhumility, abasement below.\n*Placing first*—\nexaltation, elevation above.\n*Placing externally*—\nclearing stillness, non-action.\n*Enduring*—\nlongevity, abiding in the world.\n*Selflessness*—\nplacing his body last, placing his body externally.\n*Fulfilling selfishness*—\nhis body is first, his body endures.\nThe sage does not desire to fulfill selfishness,\nyet naturally achieves the effects of his body being first and enduring.\nIf one were to assume that all people have contrivance to fulfill their selfishness,\nthen it would be possible to speak of it as such.\nBut the sage’s actions are not contrived.»",

      "translated_text": "○ Master Lǐ said:\nThe sage does not claim his own sainthood,\nthus he aligns with Heaven and Earth in **virtue/power** without end.\n\n○ Master Lín said:\nIn the sage’s cultivation of the self,\nthere is no **mind of distinction** between first and last,\nno **mind of distinction** between inner and outer,\nthus none can surpass him yet he remains ever present.\nHence, he is without selfishness yet achieves the effects of his selfishness.\nThis is not the selfishness of public and private gain,\nfor if it were, one could not say he has no **mind of distinction**.\nThese words reveal Lǎozǐ’s intent to guide people toward goodness,\nand when the **Release** [Buddhist schools] expound upon them,\nthey speak of *true emptiness, real existence*—\n*true emptiness* is the meaning of **selflessness**,\n*real existence* is the meaning of **achieving the effects of his selfishness**.\n\n○ Master Héshàng Gōng said:\nWhen people speak of selfishness,\nthey mean to enrich themselves.\nThe sage, without selfishness, enriches himself naturally,\nthus achieving the effects of his selfishness.\n\n---\n*Chapter Eight of the Daoist Canon: The Collection of Meanings*\n**上善若水** [The highest virtue is like water],\nwater benefits all things yet does not contend,\ndwelling where people deem vile,\nthus it is close to the Dao.\n\n○ Master Lín said:\nThis chapter again uses water to illustrate the meaning of **no mind of distinction**.\n**上善** [The highest virtue] refers to the utmost goodness in the world,\nits principle being akin to water’s nature.\nWater’s goodness lies in its ability to benefit all things—\nyet how often does it regard itself as capable?\nFollowing the current without resistance,\nit does not contend.\nEmbracing the low and the moist,\nit does not deem what others abhor as vile.\nWhen observed thus, water is near the Dao.\n**几** [Close], meaning **near**.\n\n○ Master Wú said:\n**上善** [The highest virtue] is the utmost extreme of virtue—\nthe virtue of those who follow the Dao.\nWhy is it like water?\nWater’s virtue lies in its irrigation and cleansing,\nits function of benefiting all things,\nyet it does not vie for high or pure places;\ninstead, it dwells in the vile and lowly spots people despise,\nthus it is close to the virtue of those who follow the Dao.\n**几** [Close], meaning **near**.\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\nNone surpass the **highest virtue** in embodying\nthe mystery of **Heaven’s One** [天一],\nthe essence of **Dao’s One** [道一],\nor fulfilling the function of **uppermost goodness**.\nWater, whether square or round, solid or fluid,\nconforms to its natural suitability—\nthis is how the sage examines the Dao,\nmodels its goodness,\nand responds to change with the times,\nlike water’s nature—\nsometimes firm, sometimes yielding,\nsometimes square, sometimes round,\nneither too much nor too little,\nthus it is said: **The highest virtue is like water**.\nThe **perfected person** [至人] unifies the Dao through One,\nand One through the Dao,\nso water is used to illustrate the **heart** [mind],\nand the **heart** [mind] is used to craft the Dao.\nMoreover, the *Shāngtóng Qì* [《参同契》] states:\n**\"One\"** is the **pivot of the Dao** [道枢],\nknowing white yet guarding black—\nall interpretations by **Péng Zhēn** [彭真人] are of **One**.\nIndeed, **golden elixir** [金液] and **jade elixir** [玉液]\nare the **pivots of the Dao** for the **golden elixir method** [金丹之道枢],\nirrigating the five **zàng organs** [五脏],\nnourishing the three **tián fields** [三田],\nswilling and descending with ease,\ncirculating and flowing without obstruction—\nthe *Huángtíng Jīng* [《黄庭经》] says:\n*\"Swilling the elixir essence, calamities do not adhere.\"*\nWithin **qi** [炁] lies **true One’s water** [真一之水],\nand within water lies **true One’s qi** [真一之炁],\nthus the **Flowering Pool** [华池] is the source of **uppermost goodness’s** benefits.\n\nDwelling in the **virtue of goodness** [善地],\nthe **heart** [mind] is the **virtue of depth** [善渊],\ngiving is the **virtue of generosity** [善仁],\nspeech is the **virtue of trustworthiness** [善信],\ngovernance is the **virtue of order** [善治],\naction is the **virtue of capability** [善能],\nmovement is the **virtue of timeliness** [善时].\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nThe opening line, **\"The highest virtue is like water\"**,**\ndoes not merely state that water is good;\nit earnestly urges all people to emulate it,\nto resemble water in possessing all these virtues of the utmost goodness.\n**Like water** is **like the Dao**.\nThus, the **virtue of goodness in dwelling** is akin to water’s relation to the earth—\nwater flows when it meets the earth,\nthe earth softens when it meets water;\nhow could it hoard its place of dwelling?\nThe **virtue of goodness in the heart** is like water’s relation to the depths—\npeople do not reflect in flowing water,\nbut in still water;\nhow could they lose their original mind?\nThe **virtue of goodness in giving** is like water’s relation to the seven [orifices]—\nit measures and pours for others,\nhow could it indulge others’ desires?\nThe **virtue of goodness in speech** is like water’s trustworthiness—\nit rises and falls with the tides,\nhow could it go back on its word?\nThe **virtue of goodness in governance** is like water’s relation to order—\nit adjusts like a balance scale,\nhow could it raise or lower its hand arbitrarily?\nThe **virtue of goodness in action** is like water’s relation to capability—\nit is capable of both square and round,\nhow could it not exhaust all means and adapt to all changes?\nThe **virtue of goodness in movement** is like water’s relation to the times—\nit halts when still, flows when moving,\nhow could it not respond to circumstances and follow natural course?\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nDwelling in the **virtue of goodness** [善地] is to benefit others.\nThe **heart** [mind] being the **virtue of depth** [善渊] is to contain all things.\nGiving as the **virtue of generosity** [善仁] is to nurture life.\nSpeech as the **virtue of trustworthiness** [善信] is to respond to all things.\nGovernance as the **virtue of order** [善治] is to transform all things.\nAction as the **virtue of capability** [善能] is to accomplish all things.\nMovement as the **virtue of timeliness** [善时] is to follow all things.\nOnly because it does not contend,\nthere is no blame against it.\n\n○ Master Lín said:\nThe seven virtues mentioned above\nall describe the goodness of those who follow the Dao,\nyet they do not regard themselves as capable—\nthus, in the world, they contend with none,\nnor do they invite blame or resentment.\nThis is the meaning of:\n*\"Only because you do not contend,\nno one in the world can contend with you.\"*\n\nMany commentators take this as the **seven lesser virtues of water**,\nso their explanations often strain the meaning—\nnot the original intent of Lǎozǐ.\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nTo encompass these several virtues,\nto begin with **non-contention** and end with **non-contention**,\nis the utmost of goodness.\nWho can emulate it?\nThus there is no blame against it.\nThe unvirtuous invite blame,\nand even if virtuous, if they cannot avoid contention,\nthey too may invite blame.\nBut if one is both virtuous and without contention,\nwhat blame could there be?\nThis is why water’s virtue resembles the Dao.\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nWater embodies **gentleness and harmony**,\ndwelling in the low—\nbenefiting all things yet not contending,\nthus there is no blame against it.\n\n○ Master Wú said:\nOnly the **uppermost goodness** of those who follow the Dao\ndoes not vie for high places yet willingly dwells in the low,\nthus people do not blame them.\n**尤** [Blame] means **resentment and censure**,\nso those who desire to rise above others\ncannot avoid a **mind of contention**,\nand where there is contention, there is blame.\n\n---\n*Chapter Nine of the Daoist Canon: The Collection of Meanings*\n**To hold and fill it** [持而盈之],\n**is not as good as letting it be** [不如其已].\n**To grasp and sharpen it**

metaphors.\nA vessel that is filled to overflowing must spill—\nto hold it is difficult,\nyet it is easier to preserve what is not filled.\n**已** [already/stop] means the intent of not filling it.\n**揣** [grasp] means **治** [refine], **锐** [sharp] means **铦** [keen].\nTo refine a vessel to its utmost keenness and sharpness,\nwithout fail it will break—\nthus, it is better to preserve what is not sharpened for long.\n\n○ Master Wú said:\n**持** [hold] means to **捧** [carry].\n**已** [already/stop] means to **止** [cease].\nThis chapter states that the Dao does not desire to be filled,\nfor when filled, it easily leads to overflowing—\nyet it is better to cease and avoid filling.\nThe **锋** [edge] cannot remain sharp,\nfor when sharpened, it easily leads to **到** [bluntness],\nand its sharpness cannot be long preserved.\nTo fill is also to invite the loss of what is filled—\nthis is the reason as well.\n\n○ Master Liú said:\nTo be filled is to be bound to emptiness—\nbe warned against fullness.\nTo be sharpened is to be bound to dullness—\nbe warned against excess.\nGold and jade filling the hall,\nno one can guard them.\nWealth and honor with arrogance,\none invites their own downfall.\nWhen one’s achievements are complete and name established,\nto retreat is the Dao of Heaven.\nMaster Lín said:\nWhen wealth and honor reach the point of gold and jade filling the hall,\none cannot long preserve them.\nTo dwell in the rank of king or noble yet reach arrogance and fullness,\none brings upon oneself the consequences of that.\nThus, those who wish to preserve their achievements\nand safeguard their reputation must know to retreat early—\nonly then does one align with Heaven’s Dao.\n**功成** [achievements complete] and **名遂** [reputation established]\nare terms that vary with greatness and smallness,\nyet one can still preserve them—\nhence the words *complete* and *established*.\nIf one does not know when to stop,\nthen when is it ever complete?\nWhen is it ever established?\nThese four characters must be carefully examined.\n\n○ Master Wú said:\nIn the world, there are those who have gold and jade filling their halls\nyet cannot guard them—\nwhy is this?\nIt is because wealth and honor breed arrogance,\nand one invites their own downfall.\nThus, when achievements are complete and reputation established,\nto retreat is in accord with Heaven’s Dao—\nthis is the saying of *not desiring to be filled*.\nGold and jade filling the hall means wealth,\narrogance means those who fill themselves—\ntheir misfortune is self-inflicted, not by others.\nAchievements complete and reputation established means honor,\nto retreat means to not fill oneself—\nHeaven’s Dao is empty yet not filled,\nthus the sequence of the four seasons.\nThose who achieve success depart.\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nAchievements complete and reputation established,\nyet one retreats—\nthis is the warning against excess and the encouragement of humility.\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n*\"To know advancement and retreat, survival and perishing,\nyet never lose one’s true path—\nwho but the Sage can do so?\"*\nLù Xīshēng said:\nTo carry a great vessel and be filled to overflowing,\neven if one fears it, it is better to cease early.\nTo occupy a high position and be extreme in one’s conduct,\neven if one worries, it is better to withdraw early.\nAs for following the wanderings of the Red Pine [赤松],\nor drifting away in a small boat [扁舟],\nthis also clearly shows the meaning of *not desiring to be filled*.\n\n○ Master Liú said:\nGold and jade must accumulate—\nbe warned against greed.\nWealth and honor must lead to licentiousness—\nbe warned against pride.\nAchievements complete and reputation established must bring danger—\nbe warned against not knowing when to stop.\nThe words of the Master Lǎo are deeply meant to save people—\nnot saying that those who abandon worldly affairs and dwell in the mountains and forests\ncan enter the Dao.\nEven while residing in the realm of wealth, honor, achievements, and reputation,\nall can be diligently practiced.\n\n---\n**Chapter Ten**\nTo carry the **魂** [hun/soul] and embrace

guard the One,\nand the One also guards the child.\nTo focus **炁** [qi] and attain **柔** [gentleness],\nto be like an infant—\nthe scripture says: *\"The depth of virtue is compared to an infant,\nbones weak, sinews soft, yet grip firm.\"*\nTo focus **炁** [qi] is to preserve **纯气** [pure qi].\nTo attain **柔** [gentleness] is to reach **至和** [ultimate harmony] without deviation.\nThis is how the Great Person never loses the heart of an infant.\n\n○ Master Lín said:\n**载** [carry] is like a cart carrying goods.\nAn infant has not yet encountered sights or sounds,\nthus its **炁** [qi] is focused.\n**致** [attain] means **极** [to reach the utmost],\n**柔** [gentleness] means **顺** [to comply].\nIf one can be like an infant in focusing **炁** [qi] and attaining gentleness,\nthen one can embrace the One.\nHence it is said: *\"To focus qi and attain gentleness,\ncan one be like an infant?\"*\nThis is the Master Lǎo’s rhetorical question.\nIt means: *\"Can people truly do this?\"*\nThe following sentences are all in this vein.\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\nA strong **魂** [hun/soul] is the companion of life,\na robust **魄** [pò/soul] is the companion of death.\nThe **魂** [hun/soul], belonging to **阳** [yang], delights in clarity and emptiness,\nwhile the **魄** [pò/soul], belonging to **阴** [yin], thrives in agitation and disturbance.\nThe **魄** [pò/soul] is the **阳** [yang]'s thief,\nand moreover, the nature of the **魄** [pò/soul] is to:\nindulge people in sensory pleasures,\npursue superficial splendor,\nbe lost in drowsiness and slumber,\nand roam freely—\ndraining one’s vital essence and **精气** [jing-qi],\nleading people to perish,\nso that after the body decays,\nit may enjoy their sacrifices.\nThus, the Sage governs **神** [spirit] with **炁** [qi],\nand restrains **魄** [pò/soul] with the form,\nfollowing the method of Earth’s use—\nsettled, tranquil, and deeply rooted,\nsteadfast and unmoving.\nThough the **阴魄** [yin-pò/soul] may desire to agitate,\nstirring one’s thoughts and worries,\ncan it truly succeed?\nHence it is said: *\"To carry the魄 [pò/soul].\"*\nThe original method of carrying it\nis to embrace the One without separation.\nTo embrace the One is like a mirror containing clarity—\nhow could clarity ever separate from the mirror?\nYet one fears that the carrying may not be thorough,\nso though pure and unchanging,\nit is called *not two*—\nonly then can the spirit be complete and unharmed,\nthe essence be used without depletion,\nand never for an instant be separated.\nHence it is said: *\"To embrace the One,\ncan one avoid separation?\"*\nMoreover, if the spirit is not governed,\nthe qi will be disordered;\nif the spirit is governed,\nthe qi will not act recklessly.\n\nThe Perfect Person excels in regulation and control,\nfocused on sincerity and purity.\nThey nourish it with **虚** [emptiness],\nand rest it with **踵** [retreat].\nPure, refined, and gentle,\ntheir cultivation of **炁** [qi] is like that of the **灵龟** [spiritual tortoise],\nand their nurturing of the spirit is like that of an infant.\nAn infant embodies the depth of virtue,\ndwelling in ignorance of what to do,\nmoving without knowing where to go—\nhence it is said: *\"To focus qi and attain gentleness,\ncan one be like an infant?\"*\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nTo carry the **魄** [pò/soul] is like the metaphor of a cart carrying goods.\nThe **魄** [pò/soul] loves movement,\nloves to roam freely,\nloves sharpness and vigor—\nthus it is called *campaigning魄 [pò/soul]*.\nThe **魄** [pò/soul] belongs to yin;\nwhen yin is excessive, it harms yang,\nand when emotions are excessive, they enslave the nature.\nThose who can subdue and restrain it\nembrace the One without separation,\nattain gentleness without flaw,\nand practice *non-action as the female*—\nnon-knowing makes the yin **魄** [pò/soul] unable to indulge its emotions.\nWhen the **魄** [pò/soul] is subdued and yin is consumed,\nthe spirit becomes serene and the nature tranquil.»",

the **pò/soul**.\n\nTo purify and remove the **玄鉴** [xuánjiàn/mysterious mirror],\ncan one be without flaw?\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nWhen Guān Yīn Zǐ knows the heart is without substance,\nthen he knows all things are without substance.\nWhen he knows all things are without substance,\nthen he knows the Dao is without substance—\nthus he does not revere words of mysterious profundity.\nThose who ponder mysterious profundity only harm their spirit.\nThis speaks of washing away the **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision],\nremoving the heart’s blemishes,\nthus attaining flawlessness.\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\nNot being swayed by the **pò/soul**,\ninternally not being controlled by **qi**,\ncleansing all thoughts and discarding all desires—\nthis is called **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision].\nThe **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision] observes its subtlety,\nyet it is not what the eyes can see.\nExcluding the utmost truth,\nall else is screened away—\nexterior and interior, hollow and clear,\nnaturally empty and resonant.\nThe spiritual repository is serene and still—\nonly then can one attain **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision].\nOnce **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision] is attained,\nit becomes an obstacle to **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision] itself—\nwhen **玄览** [xuánlǎn/mysterious vision] is removed,\nthen there is no flaw.\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nSeeing nothing, hearing nothing—\ndust cleansed, the mirror bright.\n\n○ Master Dòng said:\nIf the vision of mysterious profundity is not removed,\nit is like untying bonds.\nIf traces of purification remain,\nit is like an obstacle to awakening.\nWhen there is no flaw,\nthe love of dharma fades and duality is extinguished.\n\nTo love the nation and govern the people—\ncan one practice non-action?\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nThe Yellow Emperor’s writings on enriching the nation and securing the people\nare methods of refining **qi**.\nThe Sage takes the body as the nation,\nthe heart as the ruler,\n**精氣** [jīngqì/essence-qi] as the people—\nwhen the people are at ease, the nation prospers;\nwhen the people scatter, the nation weakens.\nWhen the heart practices non-action, **qi** harmonizes—\nwhen **qi** harmonizes, all treasures gather.\nWhen the heart acts, **qi** becomes disordered—\nwhen **qi** is disordered, brilliance disperses.\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\nThe perfected one governs the body\njust as one governs a nation—\nloving the people is how one secures the nation,\nloving **qi** is how one preserves the body.\nThose who love the body well\ntake the heart as ruler,\nblood as ministers,\n**qi** as the people.\nUnifying nature, nurturing **qi**,\nfilling every passage,\ntreasuring and regulating it,\nletting it flow naturally—\nthen what need is there for action?\n\nGoverning the nation and the body—\ntheir principles are one and the same.\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nUnmoving, unshaken—\nthe Dao flourishes, the times are clear.\n\nThe opening and closing of the **天門** [tiānmén/Heaven’s Gate],\ncan one avoid being **雌** [cí/female]?\n\n○ Master Hé said:\n*Zhuangzi* says: *\"There is an exit and an entrance,\nentering and exiting without seeing its form—\nthis is called the Heaven’s Gate.\"*\nIt also says: *\"If the heart rejects this,\nthe Heaven’s Gate will not open.\"*\nThis speaks of the Heaven’s Gate as the **玄門** [xuánmén/mysterious gate].\nThe transformation of opening and closing—\nguarding stillness, guarding softness—\nis to guard **雌** [cí/female].\n○ Master Lín said:\nThe Heaven’s Gate is the natural principle between Heaven and Earth.\n○ Master Niè said:\nThe Heaven’s Gate is **乾** [qián/Heaven],\n*Yijing* calls it the \"door\"—\nwhere there is opening, there must be closing,\nopening and closing mutually functioning.\n\nSome say: *\"能無雌\"* [néng wú cí/can one avoid being female]\nshould be *\"能為雌\"* [néng wéi cí/can one be female],\nyet following the context above—*\"能無雌乎\"* [néng wú cí hū/can one avoid being female]—\nit means one does not desire flaws.\nTo say *\"能無為乎\"* [néng wú wéi hū/can one practice non-action]\nis to say one does not desire action.\nNow to say *\"能無雌\"* [néng wú cí/can one avoid being female]\nis to say one does not desire **雌** [cí/female].\nLaozi values softness above all—\nyet to say *\"無雌\"* [wú cí/avoid being female]\nis to unify in **雌** [cí/female] while having no **雄** [xióng/male],\nmeaning one can close but cannot open—\nthis is not the Heaven’s Gate.\nThus, the meaning of *\"無雌\"* [wú cí/avoid being female]\nis to supplement yin with yang.\n\nSome manuscripts say *\"能為雌\"* [néng wéi cí/can one be female],\nbut only Master Niè says *\"能無雌\"* [néng wú cí/can one avoid being female].\nYet judging from the context above and below,\n*\"無雌\"* [wú cí/avoid being female] aligns more smoothly with the meaning.\nSome say: *\"雌\"* [cí/female] is stillness without stagnation—\nthus *\"無雌\"* [wú cí/avoid being female].\nOthers say: *\"無雌\"* [wú cí/avoid being female] means\nno yin perversity to intervene—\nthis also makes sense.\n\nClear and open in all directions—\ncan one avoid knowing?\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nClear and open in all directions—\nthis is awakening, this is illumination.\nIf one can be as if without knowing,\nthen one awakens yet does not illuminate,\nsees yet remains constantly still—\nthis is what is called *\"無知\"* [wú zhī/avoid knowing] as true knowing.\n\n○ Master Lǚ said:\nBy nature, Heaven is luminous and transparent,\nits light extending to the four horizons,\nilluminating the eight extremes.\nSubstantial yet appearing empty,\npresent yet appearing absent—\nits wisdom encompasses all things,\nyet returns wisdom to foolishness,\nits brightness surpasses the three luminaries,\nyet returns to darkness.\nMaking people act daily without knowing—\nthus it is said: *\"明四達\"* [míng sì dá/clear and open in all directions],\ncan one avoid knowing?\n\n○ Master Lín said:\nClear and open in all directions—\nomniscient, yet taking *\"無知\"* [wú zhī/avoid knowing] as knowing,\nthen one can embrace the One.\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nExcluding sharpness, screening out wisdom,\nharmonizing light with dust.\n\nTo nurture and store life—\nto give birth without possessing,\nto act without relying,\nto grow without dominating—\nthis is called **玄德** [xuándé/mysterious virtue].\n\n○ Master Hé said:\nIf one does not act in two ways toward things,\nthen one’s ability to give birth to things is unfathomable.\nThe Sage models himself after Heaven and Earth,\nloving and nurturing all things—\nto give birth is the Dao,\nto store is virtue.\nThough giving birth and not giving birth are the same,\nthough acting and not acting are the same,\nthough being an instrument of growth and not growing are the same—\nthe utmost emptiness, the extreme of stillness,\nthe mysterious virtue of Heaven—\nhow could one cling to, rely on, or dominate,\nand burden the wondrous virtue of the mysterious?\n\n○ Master Lǐ said:\nTo nurture and store life,\nwithout possessing, without relying, without dominating—\nthis is to forget one’s own origins.\n\n○ Master Wú said:\nTo give birth—\nthough one gives birth, in truth there is no mind in giving birth,\nthus it is said: *\"不有\"* [bù yǒu/not possessing].\nTo store—\nthough one acts, in truth there is no mind in acting,\nthus it is said: *\"不恃\"* [bù shì/not relying].\nLike an official in charge—\nthough one governs the people, in truth there is no mind in governing,\nthus it is said: *\"不宰\"* [bù zǎi/not dominating].\nThis is how one attains the mysterious and unfathomable virtue.\n\n○ Master Lín said:\nTo nurture and store life—\nthis speaks of the transformations between creation and nurturing all things.\nCreation and nurturing never rely on this as having,\nnever rely on this as ability—\nthough one is the longest of all things,\none never has the mind to dominate all things.\nOnly then can it be called the mysterious and profound virtue.\nThe intent of this chapter\nlargely centers on *\"無為而為\"* [wú wéi ér wéi/non-action as action],\nnatural and effortless.",

vessel,\nyet when the space within it is empty,\nthe use of the vessel arises.\nPierce doors and windows to make a room,\nyet when the space within it is empty,\nthe use of the room arises.\nThus, having is for utility,\nbut emptiness is for function.\n\nMaster Lǐ said:\nWhen spokes converge with the hub,\nit is for the wheel’s practical utility—\nthis is like gathering all dharmas into the mind,\nand the wondrous completeness of the spirit.\nWithout spokes converging with the hub,\nhow could it be called a wheel?\nWithout dharmas converging with the mind,\nthere is no way for the spirit to pass through.\nThe hub is hollow within,\nso the wheel can move and run.\nThe mind is hollow within,\nso the spirit can transform and adapt.\nThus, emptiness is the true utility,\nand utility is the empty function.\nEmptiness and utility interpenetrate,\nfree from obstruction in coming and going—\nthis is the essence of the previous chapter’s teaching on storing and nurturing the vital essence.\nWhen there is nothing to store,\nspokes and hub are both forgotten,\nand the wheel returns to non-being—\njust as when mind and dharmas are both forgotten,\nthe spirit returns to emptiness.\nThe same principle applies to vessels and rooms.\n\nMaster Wú said:\nSpokes are the rims of the wheel,\nthe hub is its center,\nand emptiness refers to the hollow space within.\n*Cao* (埏) means blending clay,\nand *zhi* (埴) is the sticky portion of clay.\nHaving this wheel, this vessel, this room—\nall are for the benefit of the world,\nso it is said: *\"having is for utility.\"*\nWheels, vessels, and rooms all rely on their inner emptiness for function,\nso it is said: *\"emptiness is for utility.\"*\nA person’s solid body contains *qi*,\nwhich sustains life—this is called *\"utility.\"*\nA hollow mind contains nothing,\nyet it is the source of *qi*—this is called *\"utility.\"*\nThus, these two aspects are used as analogies.\n\nMaster Lín said:\nAll three are metaphors—\nemptiness is their function,\nwhile wheels, vessels, and rooms are solid utilities.\nYet the very reason they become wheels, vessels, or rooms\nlies in their emptiness within.\nThis metaphor vividly illustrates the character *\"wu\"* (無),\na stroke of ingenious insight.\n\nMaster Lǚ said:\nThe wheel moves because of its emptiness,\nthe vessel holds because of its emptiness,\nand the room is spacious because of its emptiness.\nBy elaborating on these three aspects,\nit is valued to use things as analogies for oneself.\nTo preserve what is, one must rely on vessels,\nbut to preserve what is not, one must rely on the Dao.\nThe perfected one assumes the form of what is\nwhile refining the spirit of what is not.\nWithout what is, there is no way to apply its utility,\nwithout what is not, there is no way to achieve its function.\nThe form is for preserving life’s utility,\nwhile emptiness is for attaining the spirit’s function.\nAction is for the utility of things,\nnon-action is for the utility of function.\n\nMaster Hé said:\nWhat is solid cannot be used by what is solid—\nthis refers to the form.\nYet the form is used by emptiness—\nthis refers to the spirit.\nThe hub, with its single hollow aperture,\nmoves the multitude of thirty spokes—\nis it the wheel itself that is the wheel?\nNo, it is the wheel’s emptiness that makes it a wheel.\nClay is shaped into a vessel,\nbut if not fired, it quickly decays.\nThe vessel is indeed formed by blending clay,\nyet if its interior is not hollow,\nwhere will things be received?\nIs it the vessel itself that is the vessel?\nNo, it is the vessel’s emptiness that makes it a vessel.\nEven if a palace is beautiful,\nsealed with walls and barriers,\nwhat use is it?\nTo enter the hall, one must pass through the door—\nis it the room itself that is the room?\nNo, it is the room’s emptiness that makes it a room.\nThe body is like a thing,\njust as the wheel, vessel, and room are mere physical implements.\nThe Dao and the mind are like the hub and the window,\npossessing the wondrous clarity of spirit.\nThe *Yì* says:\n*\"What is above form is called the Dao,\nwhat is below form is called the instrument.\"*\nIt is not merely that the Dao precedes instruments,\nfor even within a single instrument,\nthe Dao inherently resides.\nWhen people see the instrument’s solid existence,\nI see the Dao’s wondrous emptiness—\nthen, in the midst of boundless utility and empty passage,\nthere is something that transcends the instrument itself.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deaf the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the palate,\ngalloping and hunting make the heart mad,\nrare treasures obstruct moral conduct.\nMaster Lǐ said:\nThis follows upon the previous chapter’s teaching on empty utility—\nwhen one empties utility, one is not dazzled by sounds and colors.\nThus, the five colors blind the eyes,\nfor colors and sounds, flavors and things\nare all *root-dusts* (根尘),\nand all worldly people fall victim to their theft.\nOnly those who follow the Dao do not succumb to deception,\nfor they act only when it is proper—\nthen the six thieves become the six passages.\n\nMaster Lín said:\n*\"Blind the eyes\"* means to be confused by sight,\n*\"deaf the ears\"* means to be confused by hearing,\n*\"dull the palate\"* means to lose the true taste,\n*\"make the heart mad\"* means instability,\nand *\"obstruct moral conduct\"* means hindering virtue.\nThese five aspects all involve indulging in externals\nwhile losing the essence of the inner self.\n\nMaster Lǚ said:\nGazing at colors, listening to tones, tasting flavors—\nall are burdens upon true nature.\nEven before an infant knows its own desires,\nwhat is sound or color,\nwhat is flavor or taste?\nBut once the senses open,\nit knows of green and black hues,\nof the splendor of brocade and embroidery,\nand chases after things in competition,\nunable to penetrate the sight of colorless color.\nWhat difference is there between this and blindness?\nTrue sight is not merely external vision,\nseeing only what is singular—\nonly the perfected one examines the eyes,\nfor they are the sun and moon of *Taiyi* (太乙).\nIn the midst of stillness and emptiness,\none can gather sight and turn the gaze inward,\nwith spirit-light radiant and clear—\neven in the deepest darkness,\none alone sees the dawn.\nHow could this be blindness to the five colors?\n\nWhat are the five tones?\nThey are *gong, shang, jue, zhi, yu* (宮商角徵羽),\nthe sounds of Zheng and Wei music,\nwhich make people indulge in pleasure,\ndisturb their true nature,\nand impair their spiritual clarity.\nUnable to return to the hearing of soundless sound,\nwhat difference is there between this and deafness?\nTrue hearing is not merely external listening,\nbut attaining harmony within.\nOnly the sage discerns the ears,\nfor they are the *listening gates* of the Celestial Sovereign.\nIn profound stillness,\none listens with *qi*—\nthen the celestial resonances hum,\nand the celestial melodies echo,\nsometimes like the sound of gold and jade,\nsometimes like the music of zither and strings.\nOnce this sound is heard,\neven if external winds shake the seas\nor thunder splits the mountains,\none does not hear them—\nhow could this be deafness to the five tones?",

The *zhàochéng* pearl,\nthe *liánchéng* jade—\nthe world’s treasures,\nthe people’s prized possessions.\nIf one demands them without restraint,\nexceeding their due,\na single misstep\nwill cause all their conduct to fade and vanish.\n\nThe Perfect One regards all things as *chányì*,\nsees *Sōngyue* as a mere blemish,\nuntainted by desire,\nself-soaring in the Dao—\neven rare treasures could never obstruct their path.\n\n---\n*He Shi* says:\n*\"In the* Zhuangzi*, five colors blind the eyes,\nmaking vision unclear;\nfive tones deafen the ears,\nmaking hearing dull;\nfive flavors corrupt the mouth,\nmaking taste* cang.\n*Rushing and retreating unsettle the heart,\nmaking nature soar wildly—\nthis sentiment aligns with this chapter.*\n\nOnce there was a man who loved hunting,\nclaiming it made one forget death—\nwas this not the madness of the heart?\n\nThere was a man who, at dawn, rushed to the market to seize gold.\nWhen the pursuers questioned him,\nhe said: *\"When taking the gold,\nI saw only gold,\nnot people.\"*\nIs this not a treasure that obstructs one’s path?\n\nThe chapter’s use of *order* and the *Zhuangzi*’s *make* both describe\nhow when things grow heavy, the

*difference*—loss, not *brightness*.\n\n---\n*Zhào Shi* says:\nIf one does not indulge in the pleasures of ears and eyes,\nnor the delights of mouth and stomach,\nand does not seek gain—\nthen naturally, there will be no loss.\nThus, the sage nourishes the *fù* rather than the *mù*,\nand so discards the former to take the latter.\n\n*Lǐ Shi* says:\nTo nourish the *fù* rather than the *mù*—\nthe inner realm does not stray,\nthe outer realm does not intrude—\nretracting sight, returning hearing.\n\n---\n*Lín Shi* says:\nThe *fù* is the inner self,\nthe *mù* is the outer.\nThe sage attends to the inner and not the outer,\nthus it is said: *discard the former, take the latter.*\nThe former refers to the five above,\nthe latter, the Dao.\n\n---\n*Lǚ Shi* says:\n*Kūn* is the *fù*,

spirit.\n\nThe *mù* perceives the outer,\nfixating on all colors,\ndisturbing the true dwelling.\nThus, the sage cultivates the inner,\nnot the outer,\nseeking within rather than without.\n\nRetracting sight, returning hearing—\nrestoring the command, returning to origin—\ndiscarding the spirit of the *mù*,\ntaking the essence of the *fù*—\nthus it is said: *discard the former, take the latter.*\n\n---\n*He Shi* says:\nTo indulge the emotions exhausts the spirit,\nto adorn the outer harms the inner.\nThus, to nourish the *fù* is to focus solely on the inner,\nwhile to indulge the *mù* is to let the outer dominate—\nthe eyes see, the heart moves.\nMany things can lure one away,\nbut if forgotten by the *mù*, light overflows without bound.\nIf the *fù* is filled, there is a master within.\nTo take this is the Dao;\nto discard that is the world.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirteen**\n*Honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks,*\n*great calamities are like threats to one’s life.*\n\n*Lǚ Shi* says:\nHonors and humiliations are the natural course of gain and loss,\nwhile the *yòushēn* is the greatest calamity to true nature.\nHonor is followed by

one grieves,\nand humiliations abound—\nhow could this not be shocking?\nThus it is said: *honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks.*\n\nThe body is not inherently noble;\nwhat is noble is *xìng* and *mìng*.\nHumanity is not inherently plagued by calamity;\nwhat is calamitious is *dé* and *shī*.\nThus, in life,\none stumbles upon cold and heat,\nentangles in right and wrong,\nis

great calamities.\nThus, those who know the Dao do not prize them,\nwhile those who prize them are ensnared by them—\n*ensnared* meaning unable to extricate themselves,\nand thus burdened by them.\n\nWhat is meant by *honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks*?\nHonor is lowly—\nto receive it is shocking,\nto lose it is shocking—\nthis is called *honors and humiliations are like sudden shocks.*\n\n*Lǚ Shi* says:\nWhat are honors and humiliations?\nAre they not the sway of kin and authority,\nbending the body and lowering the head,\nrefining speech and waiting for

      "translated_text": "Yet honor is the root of humiliation, and fortune the seed of calamity.\nWhen honor descends upon one,\nit comes with lofty carriages and four steeds,\ntowering halls and carved walls,\njades at the girdle and chimes at the belt,\nrank elevated to its utmost,\nfavor extending to one’s descendants—\nnothing is withheld.\nOnce obtained, one rejoices as if struck by shock.\n\nWhen humiliation arrives,\nsuddenly grace wanes and favor fades,\nslander spreads like seeping moisture,\nmorning whispers turn to evening dismissal,\ndeep blame and heavy punishment follow—\ncalamity comes without turning back.\nOne loses it abruptly, trembling as if struck by shock.\nThus, one honor and one humiliation,\nlike shadow following form,\nboth are causes for shock.\n\nOnly the Sage is not enslaved by form.\nHe regards honor as humiliation,\nflees fame and abandons the world,\npreserves his body and avoids harm,\nequalizes praise and blame,\nunifies life and death,\ndoes not scheme externally,\ndoes not fret internally,\ndoes not indulge his will in high rank,\ndoes not conform to vulgarity in poverty.\nLooking back on gains and losses of honor and humiliation—\nhow could they shock him?\n\n**He Shi says:**\nWhat is meant by *honor and humiliation*?\nHonor is lowly—\nfor when fame arises, slander follows—\nthis is called lowly.\nHigh office brings danger—\nthis too is lowly.\nHonor itself is lowly;\nto obtain it is to lose—\nfor one knows its lowliness without waiting for humiliation.\n\n**Lin Shi says:**\nThis is the meaning of *fearing gain and fearing loss*.\n\nWhat is meant by *treating great calamity as one’s own body*?\nThe reason I have great calamity\nis that I have a body.\nBut when I have no body,\nwhat calamity do I have?\n**Lü Shi says:**\nWhat the world values as *treating great calamity as one’s own body*\nis this: when a person is born,\nhe shares the same root as Heaven and Earth,\nand all things draw sustenance from it.\nThe petty man pursues profit,\nthe scholar pursues fame—\nthough their power and influence differ,\nto have a body makes them one in this regard.\nThe world says that without a body, there is no calamity—\nthis is to lose the Master’s intent.\n\nHow could the Perfect Man’s *great calamity of having a body*\nmean abandoning form and losing his physical self,\nsinking into dull emptiness?\nIt means he is ensnared by things and fixated on self,\nnot embodying the Dao.\n\nThus, his heart is like dead ashes,\nhis form like withered wood—\nthough honored, he is not humiliated;\nthough humiliated, he has no calamity.\nHe transcends his body as if it were not his,\nforgets his mind as if it were not his,\ndiscards illusion and attains the eternal truth,\nabandons awareness and sits in forgetfulness.\nThen the jade talisman preserves his spirit,\nthe golden elixir refines his form—\nform and spirit both attain marvelous harmony,\nmerging with the Dao’s true essence.\nNo longer afflicted by having a body,\nhow could he suffer great calamity?\n\n**He Shi says:**\nWhat is meant by *treating great calamity as one’s own body*?\n*Noble* means *weighty*—\nthe body is a great calamity,\nworthy of weighty regard, not to be treated lightly.\nThe body is small, yet the calamity is great;\nwhen the body is forgotten, calamity ceases—\nthis is clear.\nThus it is said:\nEars and eyes, sounds and colors—\nthese are the child’s lingering debts.\nThe nose and mouth crave fragrance and flavor—\nthese are sources of resentment.\nThe body is the root of vexation:\npain, itching, cold, heat—\nbecause I am bound to the body, I know great calamity.\nYet once formed, I cannot suddenly make it cease to be a source of calamity—\nwhat benefit is there?\nThe Sage summarizes this in one phrase:\n*Transcend the body while the body exists.*\nWhy not consider that form is not mine to possess,\nthat name is not mine to retain?\nWhat I am born from\ncomes from the natural void—\nstructured by *qi* and taking shape.\nThus, though I receive form,\nthe form is not mine.\nForm is lent to me as form,\nshown to me as appearance.\nTherefore, those who attain the Dao\ntranscend the physical frame to conquer themselves,\ntransforming their essence and cultivating purity,\ndiligently practicing the Dao of boundless formlessness—\nthen what others fear,\nI have no fear of.\n\nMoreover, the body is indeed the root of calamity,\nyet having a body means having things—\nthis is what invites calamity.\n**Liezi said:**\n*The body is not mine to possess.*\nThough born, I must preserve it—\nthings are not mine to possess,\nthough I have them, I must abandon them.\nThe body is the master of life,\nthings are the master of nourishment—\nthough I preserve my body,\nI cannot possess it;\nthough I do not abandon things,\nI cannot possess them.\nTo possess things and the body\nis to arrogantly claim Heaven’s body and Heaven’s things—\nhow could such a one be a Sage?\n\nTo make Heaven’s body and Heaven’s things public—\nthis means not claiming them as one’s own,\nbut offering them to the world—\nthen the body can be forgotten,\nand calamity can be forgotten.\n\nThus, to honor the body as the world’s\nis to entrust it to the world.\nTo love the body as the world’s\nis to commit it to the world.\n**Wu Shi says:**\nThe Son of Heaven’s eminence,\nthe wealth of the Four Seas—\nall stem from treating the body as the world’s.\nThose who know the Dao\ncherish and treasure this body,\nnot daring to use it for the world’s sake,\npreferring to have no world rather than lightly use their body.\nOnly thus can they be entrusted with the world.\n*Entrust* is like entrusting a command over a hundred *li*;\n*commit* is like committing a six-foot orphan.\nShun and Yu held the world yet did not possess it—\nthus the succession of Tang and Yu.\nThose who take honor and humiliation as glory,\nwho value great calamity as great profit—\nthese are vulgar men.\nHow could one entrust the world to them?\n\n**He Shi says:**\nIf one values and loves this body more than the world itself,\nsuch a person will not be moved by the world,\nand thus can be entrusted with its care.\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\n*The true Dao governs the body;\nits coarse husk governs the world.*\nYet today’s common scholars\noften endanger their bodies and abandon life for things—\nis this not tragic?\nThis is like the parable of the *hidden pearl used to strike a sparrow.*\n\n**Lin Shi says:**\nThe words *entrust* and *commit*\nimply the world is not possessed.\n\n**Dong Shi says:**\nThis chapter clarifies the abandonment of false emotions\nand restores true nature.\nIt says:\nAbandon honor, and humiliation will not reach you;\nforget the body, and calamity will not come.\nThe world is a great thing—\nyet it is not a burden.\nWhat of lesser things?\n\n**Chapter Fourteen.**",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Fifteen of the *Jade Decisions of the Wu River*: The Ancient Virtuous Scholar**\n\nThe ancient virtuous scholar was subtle, mysterious, and profound—so deep as to be unknowable.\nOnly because he was unknowable did he feign outward forms.\n\n○ **Master Wu** says: *\"Scholar\"* refers to one who embodies the *Dao*. *\"Edging through\"* means *communing*—one who penetrates the mysteries of all things is without limit in his profundity. Subtle yet not manifest, his communion is profound and hard to discern, like the depths of water beyond measure. His depths are unfathomable, so he feigns outward semblances to show others. The seven descriptions below are these.\n\n○ **Master Lin** says: This chapter depicts the virtuous scholar, profound in the *Dao*, yet beyond all recognition. His heart is empty, unknowing—his outward bearing arises from no contrivance, hence *\"feigning outward forms.\"* From *\"joyous as\"* onward, this is the true depiction of the virtuous one’s bearing—most refined.\n\n○ **Master He** says: The scholar’s *Dao* is subtle and mysterious, elusive and unobstructed—who could fathom it? Since it lies beyond perception, even naming it is a forced analogy, hence the comparisons below.\n\nJoyous as one crossing a river in winter,\nHesitant as one fearing four neighbors,\nSolemn as a guest,\nDissolving as ice about to thaw,\nThick as uncarved wood,\nVast as a valley,\nMuddled as turbid water.\n\n○ **Master Wu** says: *\"Joyous\"* and *\"hesitant\"* are names of beasts—*\"joyous\"* belongs to the elephant clan, *\"hesitant\"* to the puppy. The elephant knows ahead but moves cautiously; the puppy follows then turns back, hence *\"hesitant\"* means lingering without progress. Crossing in winter is fearful of cold; fearing four neighbors is wary of enemies—thus, the scholar does not dare lead the world, and his bearing is such.\n\n*\"Solemn\"*—dignified and composed.\n*\"As a guest\"*—following without presuming.\n*\"Dissolving\"*—scattered and unfixed.\n*\"As ice about to thaw\"*—melting yet not clinging.\n*\"Thick\"*—sincere and unadorned.\n*\"Uncarved wood\"*—raw material not yet shaped.\n*\"Vast\"*—open and receptive.\n*\"As a valley\"*—empty yet responsive.\n*\"Muddled\"*—unrefined in appearance.\n*\"As turbid water\"*—embracing both beauty and flaw without self-purification.\n\n○ **Master He** says: In the twelfth month, the carts are built, and people do not yet fear crossing rivers. The difficulty of winter crossing mirrors the scholar’s caution—*\"joyous as\"* resembles this. *\"No easy path\"*—ears pressed to walls—this is the fear of four neighbors. The scholar’s secrecy is like *\"hesitant.\"* The host does not inquire, the guest does not act first—the scholar does not lead others, hence *\"solemn as.\"* Water freezes into ice, ice melts back to water—the scholar is unobstructed by things, hence *\"dissolving as.\"* *\"Thick as\"* is like uncut wood not yet divided; *\"vast as\"* is like a valley not yet filled; *\"muddled as\"* is like turbid water receiving filth. Each description vividly portrays the likeness of the virtuous scholar’s *Dao*—hard to exhaust in words.\n\nWho can make turbid water still and gradually clear?\nWho can make the settled gradually move?\n\n○ **Master Wu** says: This follows the *\"muddled\"* of above, asking: *\"Who can make it turbid?\"* Turbidity is the time of motion—when motion follows stillness, clarity emerges gradually. Again, from *\"settled,\"* it asks: *\"Who can make it still?\"* Stillness is the time of rest—when rest gives way to motion, life arises gradually. *\"Settled\"* means steadfast; *\"move\"* means activity. Only because of turbidity does clarity arise; only because of stillness does motion arise. Thus, the vast is not full yet full, the thick is not shaped yet shaped, the dissolving is not fixed yet fixed, the solemn is not the host yet the host, the hesitant is not the first yet the first—this can be understood.\n\n○ **Master He** says: This *Dao* never fails to encompass both essence and function, permeating motion and stillness—it is not mere empty talk. To harmonize its light, to blend with dust, to mingle with the world’s turbidity—yet there is a quiet, detached clarity. To close the mouth, seal the gate—though settled and at rest, there is a sudden, spontaneous vitality. The two *\"gradually\"* emphasize natural, unforced progression. This speaks of how stillness can make turbidity gradually clear, and motion can make the settled gradually vital—motion and stillness in mutual use.\n\n○ **Master Lin** says: These two lines simply mean clarity within turbidity, stillness within motion.\n\nTo preserve this *Dao* is to avoid fullness.\nOnly by avoiding fullness can one embrace decay;\nOnly by embracing decay can one avoid renewal.\n\n○ **Master Wu** says: *\"Renewal\"* means completion. All things decay and become deficient, or renew and become complete. Decay and deficiency are signs of non-fullness; renewal and completion are signs of fullness. Those who preserve this *Dao* do not seek fullness, hence they embrace decay rather than renewal.\n\nThe seven bearings within this chapter are all decaying yet unrenewed.\n\n○ **Master He** says: To preserve this *Dao* is to avoid fullness—this is emptiness. The *Dao* is boundless in its use; sometimes it is not full. Only because it is not full does it contrast with things. While others rush toward renewal and completion, I delight in decay, not hastening toward renewal.\n\n○ **Master Lin** says: *\"Avoid fullness\"* is emptiness; *\"decay\"* is authenticity. To decay without renewal is to remain unchanged for a thousand years as one day—only thus can one achieve the *Dao*’s ultimate fulfillment, hence decay without renewal. *\"Renewal\"* is one phrase; *\"completion\"* is another.\n\n○ **Master Li** says: Building upon the *Dao*’s essence from the previous chapter, it elucidates how later learners preserve sincerity, maintain reverence, and constantly guard their solitude—unfixed by appearances, yet embracing unity, emptiness, and daily practice. Until all attachments are extinguished, all illusions dissolved, until stirred yet not turbid, settled yet not clear—this is the *\"subtle, mysterious, profound, and hidden\"* communion.",

      "translated_text": "Chapter Sixteen: **Attain the utmost emptiness, steadfastly guard the utmost stillness.**\n\n○ **Master Wu** says: *\"Attain\"* is the process of reaching the utmost degree. *\"Emptiness\"* refers to the absence of substance, where external things do not penetrate within. *\"Utmost\"* means to exhaust its degree. *\"Guard\"* is to firmly hold within and resist without, like defending a city. *\"Stillness\"* means motionlessness, where the inner mind does not stray outward. *\"Steadfast\"* is the unflagging strength of this stillness.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says: Emptiness upon emptiness, the spirit finds its dwelling; stillness upon stillness, the spirit finds its rectitude. *Liezi* states: *\"Stillness is emptiness; in emptiness, the spirit finds its dwelling.\"* The *Sutra of Xisheng* says: *\"If a person can be empty and without action, they do not seek the Dao, yet the Dao naturally returns to them.\"* ○ **Master He** says: *Liezi* also said, *\"There are those who are born, and those who give birth.\"* Further, *\"To give birth is to return to non-birth.\"* The sage perceives the subtle principle of birth and return: whatever emerges from the *Dao*’s mechanism must reenter it. Thus, I do not swell with all things; I observe how they begin with *Gèn* and must end with *Gèn*. Hence, I remain still and do not follow them together. *\"Return\"* means to abide in the Dao and remain constant. All things, myriad and teeming, each return to their root. Returning to the root is stillness; stillness is the return of life. ○ **Master Wu** says: *\"Myriad and teeming\"* describes the living and growing motion of all things. In spring and summer, the vital *qi* ascends from the roots to the branches and leaves—this is motion. In autumn and winter, the vital *qi* descends from above and returns to the roots—this is stillness. The *qi* of heaven generates life and forms all things, called *mìng* (命). When it returns to its original place of generation, it is called *\"return of life\"* (复命).\n\n○ **Master Lü** says: All things arise from *nature* (性), like the roots of grasses and trees. They manifest through *Zhèn* (震), appear in *Lí* (离), explain in *Duì* (兑), labor in *Kǎn* (坎), and finally return to their roots. Grasses and trees have branches above and roots below, but humans are different: limbs are below, and the root is above—this is the *Níwán Gōng* (泥丸宫). The *Sutra of Yellow Court* (《黄庭经》) calls the brain *\"Níwán\"* (泥丸), the sacred domain of the *Dao*’s essence, where spirit and *qi* converge. If one can observe inwardly here, all spirits will gather, all *qi* will flow, and the *Tāixiān* (胎仙) will be perfected. Hence, *\"All things, myriad and teeming, each return to their root.\"* The noble practitioner who constructs the Dao must begin by exhausting principles, proceed by perfecting nature, and conclude by returning life. None can attain the return of life without exhausting principles and perfecting nature. Now, clarity and openness in all directions—this is exhausting principles. To attain the utmost emptiness and steadfastly guard the utmost stillness—this is perfecting nature. *Guāngchéngzǐ* (广成子) with no seeing, no hearing, embraces the spirit in stillness, and when stillness is steadfast, clarity follows. Your spirit will then guard the form, the form will endure and grow, and enduring growth means life returns.\n\n○ **Master Li** says: To practice emptiness and steadfast stillness, returning life to its root—this is the pure mystery of the spirit. If one attains this with a single, unblinking gaze, the study of a lifetime is complete. *\"Return of life\"* is constancy; knowing constancy is enlightenment. To not know constancy is to act recklessly—disastrous. Knowing constancy brings tolerance; tolerance brings fairness; fairness brings kingship; kingship brings heaven; heaven is the Dao; the Dao is enduring. Thus, one’s life is never in peril. ○ **Master Lin** says: To attain the return of life is to grasp the constancy that does not change. To know the enduring, unchanging Dao—this is enlightenment. Because people do not know this enduring, unchanging Dao, they indulge in reckless thoughts and actions, all of which are disastrous deviations from the Dao. Knowing constancy, one’s heart aligns with the vastness of heaven and earth—what cannot be embraced? Once embrace is achieved, what matter remains unfair? Kingship over all under heaven is this fair Dao. To rule with fairness is to rule with heaven. Heaven is the Dao, hence *\"kingship is heaven; heaven is the Dao.\"* Enduring is constancy; if one attains this constant Dao, their entire life is without deviation—how could there be any peril? ○ **Master He** says: Only by knowing the constant cycle of growth and decay in all things does one grasp the principle of *swelling and waning* (盈虚消息). Thus, one does not cling to minutiae, and *\"constancy becomes tolerance.\"* Knowing that beauty and ugliness, right and wrong can be embraced, one remains boundless and without bias—hence *\"tolerance becomes fairness.\"* Fairness without self-interest is the kingly Dao. Kingship without bounds is the heavenly Dao. Enduring without cessation is the constant Dao of heaven.",
      "overlap_context": "al\"* is one phrase; *\"completion\"* is another.\n\n○ **Master Li** says: Building upon the *Dao*’s essence from the previous chapter, it elucidates how later learners preserve sincerity, maintain reverence, and constantly guard their solitude—unfixed by appearances, yet embracing unity, emptiness, and daily practice. Until all attachments are extinguished, all illusions dissolved, until stirred yet not turbid, settled yet not clear—this is the *\"subtle, mysterious, profound, and hidden\"* communion.",

      "translated_text": "The Dao endures through countless ages without flaw—what peril could there be? This is the ultimate attainment of *emptiness and tranquility* (虚静).\n\n○ **Master Wu** says: Peril refers to endangering oneself. The character *殆* (dai), with the radical *歹* (evil), is glossed as *dangerous*, *near*, or *close*—most words with this radical carry the sense of *death*. Peril is danger approaching death. *没* (mo) means *to perish* or *terminate*.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\nThe *Supreme Sage* (太上) is known only as existing.\nThe next is one whom the people love and praise.\nThe next is one whom the people fear and revile.\n\nWhen virtue/power (信) is insufficient, there arises unbelief.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says: The *Supreme Sage* (太上) is one whose teaching is *wuwei* (无为), whose governance is without exertion, harmonized with the Dao itself—nothing can be added above, hence *\"the Supreme Sage.\"* Though he holds his position, he does not exalt himself, does not value nobility, but lets all things follow their natural course, each settling in its place, like the realm of *Hua Xu* (华胥之国). Thus, the world hears no talk of governance yet governs itself; the people, though aware of their ruler, say *\"What has the Emperor’s power to do with me?\"*\n\nThe *Zhou Shijing* (周诗) states:\n*\"Unknowing and unknowing, they follow the Emperor’s norms\"*—hence *\"the Supreme Sage is known only as existing.\"*\n\nMoreover, in the ancient times, the people used knotted cords for record-keeping, lived in nests, and dwelled in caves, unaware of the passage of seasons or years—this may be called the utmost governance. *Fu Xi* and *Shen Nong* (伏羲神农) emerged, and the people began to till and eat, to weave and wear. They turned toward *ren* and *yi* (仁义), toward *li* and *yue* (礼乐), and the distinctions of praise and blame began to arise.\n\nFor a ruler, if his benevolence extends to the people, those who receive it regard him as a parent; if his righteousness is embraced, they praise him like the sun and moon. The more vivid the principle of love and praise becomes, the farther it strays from the ancient Dao.\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* (《南华经》) says:\n*\"Shun’s conduct was humble, and the people delighted in it\"*—hence *\"the next is one whom the people love and praise.\"*\n\nIn later ages, governance grew artificial and deceitful, *ren* and *yi* were lost, *li* and *yue* abandoned, and the wise and foolish deceived one another. The world declined, yet the Dao persisted through political means, standardized by punishment, and the ruler’s authority was displayed to make the people *cang* (僶, yield) and obey—thus, the people did not fear his might but turned to deceit. When the people deceive, the heart to revile their ruler arises—hence *\"the next is one whom the people fear and revile.\"*\n\nThe *Five Constant Virtues* (五常) take *virtue/power* (信) as their foundation. The *Rú* (鲁) saying declares:\n*\"Without virtue/power, the people cannot stand.\"* When virtue/power is complete, the world is secure; when lost, the world is in peril.\n\nIf *ren* and *yi* (仁义) vie with sincerity, gain and loss follow in turn, and cunning schemes flourish, deceit arises—this is the insufficiency of virtue/power. Once virtue/power is insufficient, the people’s hearts of unbelief emerge. As when the *Zhōu* (周) people established oaths and the people began to rebel—hence *\"when virtue/power is insufficient, there arises unbelief.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lin** says: The *Supreme Sage* (太上) refers to the ancient times. The *lower* (下) means the world below. In the ancient times, the people of the world saw only that their ruler existed, yet all forgot themselves in the Dao’s transformation. Later, the people began to regard their ruler with love and praise. Again later, they began to fear him. Again later, they began to revile him. This shows how the world’s Dao declines ever downward. When the *Supreme Virtue* (上德) decays and virtue/power (诚信) is insufficient, then the people’s hearts of unbelief arise. This is the meaning of *\"the Shang* (商) people made oaths and the people began to rebel; the *Zhou* (周) people established assemblies and the people began to doubt.\"*\n\n○ **Master He** says: When the Sage is above, he embraces the Dao without words, yet his benevolence reaches all things. The officials and courts appear empty, the halls and courts devoid of people—no labor, no wrongful punishments. All under heaven reveres his virtue, and at such times, the people know their ruler yet know nothing else, like fish forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes. This is the Dao of the *Supreme Sage.*\n\nThe next is when the great Dao is abandoned, yet *ren* and *yi* remain—then the ruler and the people are close and praise each other within the framework of *li* and *yue*, like fish nibbling and moistening one another.\n\nThe next is when governance becomes scrutinizing, and the people become wary—then the world begins to fear the law’s severity. Again the next is when laws are established and fraud arises, punishments carried out and deceit flourishes—then the people begin to deceive their ruler, to despise him, and to revile him afterward. This is like fish devouring one another.\n\n*Zhuangzi*, in his insight into the ancient great Dao, saw that morality (道) and virtue (德) were first made clear, then *ren* and *yi* followed, and rewards and punishments were the last concern—he indeed perceived this truth.\n\nThe world’s Dao declines like a river’s current; it is difficult to restore the era when the people said *\"What has the Emperor’s power to do with me?\"* Yet when the *Supreme Sage* and *Way* are mixed with other influences, human hearts follow suit, and thus arise the shifts of affection, fear, respect, and contempt—all stemming from those above. This is the extreme of virtue/power’s insufficiency in moving the people.\n\nAgain it is said: *\"Only when my virtue/power is insufficient do the people doubt me.\"*\n\n○ **Master Li** says: The *Supreme Sage* (太上) cannot but be *wuwei*—this is the teaching of love and praise, the silent instruction. Those who are feared are governed by punishments and prohibitions; those who are reviled are rulers who have lost the people’s virtue/power. When the ruler loses virtue/power among the people, the people do not believe him. *\"Ah, how precious are his words!\"*\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled, the people all say of him: *\"He is but nature.\"* Master Li says: *\"Ah, how precious are his words!\"*—this is the silent instruction. Silent instruction, achieved through *wuwei*, means punishment is not enforced yet the people submit themselves. When his accomplishments and affairs are complete, he returns to simplicity and purity—then love, praise, fear, and revile all fade from the people’s minds. The people dwell in peace and delight in their customs, forgetting their origins, hence *\"the people say of him: ‘He is but nature.’\"*\n\n○ **Master He** says: The Sage’s reason for saying *\"Ah, how precious are his words!\"* is that he dares not use *sheng* (声) and *se* (色, sounds and appearances) to transform the people. Only when he attains the silent instruction of *wuwei* can his deeds be accomplished and affairs settled, through the natural transformation of the people—making them praise him yet not praise themselves—this is how he saves the world’s endless decline.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says: The ancient transformation was rooted in the principle of *wuwei*, in silent instruction alone. Its regard for words was thus: The *Yijing* (《易》) states:\n*\"Without words yet believed, lies in virtue and conduct\"*—thus one knows that the Sage’s single word becomes the law for all under heaven. He himself knows his words are precious, hence he diminishes them again and again, remains silent yet again and again, though he still values his words and does not utter them lightly. Today’s people merely value words, yet they are but empty rhetoric—hence *\"Ah, how precious are his words!\"*",

      "translated_text": "「The ruler of the Dao/Way makes the people improve daily and transform monthly, shifting to goodness and distancing from crime, allowing them to dwell in peace and take joy in their customs, while he governs with ease and observes from afar. The flourishing of the people and the winds of pure transformation can be restored, and when his work is accomplished and affairs settled, the common folk all say that they have found his natural Dao/Way.\n\n**Chapter XVIII:**\nWhen the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, there arise *rényì* (仁義, virtue and righteousness).\nWhen *zhìhuì* (智慧, wisdom) emerges, there arises great deceit.\n**Master Lin** says: When the Great Dao/Way is practiced, *rényì* is inherent within it. Once the names of *rényì* are established, the Dao/Way begins to fade. Hence it is said, *\"When the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, there arises rényì.\"* It is like the sun rising daily, and only then does the deceit and falsehood of the world appear.\n**Master Wu** says: The lower understanding of the previous chapter—that which is known and praised—is the Great Dao/Way. That which is cherished and commended is *rényì*. That which is feared or reviled is *zhìhuì*. From the Great Dao/Way, descending once and then again, already three grades are formed; when *zhìhuì* further transforms into great deceit, there are four grades in total. However, when the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, *rényì* arises, its change is still somewhat gradual. When *zhìhuì* emerges, great deceit swiftly follows, its change is far more abrupt.\n\n**Master Lü** says: The Great Dao/Way is the *wuwei* Dao/Way of antiquity. In its flourishing, *rényì* is practiced within it, yet the people use it without knowing its origin—it is simply the Dao/Way. The Sage’s learning first seeks *dàodé* (道德, virtue/power of the Dao) before *rényì*, whereas the learning of the common world first seeks *rényì* before *dàodé*. Yet they do not realize that *yīnyáng* (陰陽, yin and yang) is the Dao/Way of Heaven, and *gāngróu* (剛柔, firmness and softness) is the Dao/Way of Earth. *Rényì* is the Dao/Way of humankind; its essence was never truly separate from the Dao/Way, nor did the Dao/Way ever abandon *rényì*. How is it that later generations cling to *rényì* as fixed laws, causing the pristine and natural Dao/Way to dwindle, and bringing about the harm of obscuring it? It is far better to conceal *rényì*, discard deceit, return to the origins, and align with nature, then the Dao/Way will not be abandoned.\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"When the Great Dao/Way is abandoned, there arises rényì,\"*\n*\"When wisdom emerges from rényì, thieves and robbers arise from poverty,\"*\n*\"When rényì is hidden, wisdom emerges,\"*\n*\"When wisdom emerges, great deceit arises,\"*\n*\"When wisdom is insufficient, it is followed by deceit.\"*\nHence it is said, *\"When wisdom emerges, there arises great deceit.\"*\n\n**Master He** says: In the *Zhuangzi*’s age of supreme *dàodé*, uprightness is natural yet not known as *rényì*, mutual love is natural yet not known as *rén* (仁, benevolence), sincerity is natural yet not known as *zhōng* (忠, loyalty), fittingness is natural yet not known as *xìn* (信, trustworthiness). Thus actions are performed without trace, and deeds are done without record. From this perspective, the names of *rén*, *yì*, *zhōng*, and *xìn* do not stand, yet their substance remains—this is the age of supreme *dàodé*, the practice of the Great Dao/Way.\n\nWhen the *liúqīn* (六親, six relations of kinship) are not harmonious, there arise filial piety and compassion.\nWhen the state is in chaos and disorder, there arise loyal ministers.»",

      "translated_text": "「Master Lin says: Only when the *liúqīn* (六親) are not harmonious does the name of filial piety arise; only when the state is in chaos and disorder does the name of loyal ministers become known. These two lines are both allegorical.\n\n**Master Wu** says: The *liúqīn* (六親) are father, son, elder and younger brothers, and husband and wife. If respect for rank and seniority follows its proper *Dao/Way*, and there is no discord, then filial piety is merely their natural duty, and they do not recognize it as *xiào* (孝, filial piety). The blind elder (瞽叟) did not act as a father, but when Shun (舜) was acknowledged as the sage-king, only then did the people know of the filial piety of the Great Shun (大舜之孝子). The state belongs to the ruler, and the family belongs to the minister; if the ruler and minister follow their proper *Dao/Way* without chaos or disorder, then loyalty is merely their natural duty, and they do not recognize it as *zhōng* (忠, loyalty). When King Jie (桀) of the Xia (夏) ruled unjustly and evil consorts gathered, only then did the people know of the loyal ministers like Bi Gan (比干) and the Three Ren (三仁).\n\n**Master Lü** says: It is better to let the people transform naturally without governance than to wait for the state to fall into disorder and then display loyal ministers.\n\n**Master Lü** further explains: When King Jie (桀) of the Xia (夏) stood, Longfeng (龙逢) became eminent; when King Zhou (纣) of the Shang (商) perished, Bi Gan (比干) shone forth.\n\nChapter Nineteenth: *\"Abandon the Sage and discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold. Abandon benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness. Abandon cleverness and discard profit, and thieves and robbers will vanish.\"*\n\n**Master Wu** says: *\"Abandon\"* means to reject and not practice; *\"discard\"* means to reject and not employ. The Sage and wisdom refer to *zhìhuì* (智慧, wisdom). Cleverness and profit refer to *dàwěi* (大伪, great deceit).\n\n**Master Lü** says: Form, measure, law, and model—these are the works of the Sage. Strategy, calculation, manipulation, and intrigue—these are the wisdom of the Sage. If one has a mind to practice wisdom, how could they know the utmost wisdom? The Perfect One fears that the people will be confused by the Sage’s wisdom, losing their true nature even more. They value returning to the root, abandoning the Sage’s artifices, discarding wisdom, and letting the people be like innocent children, devoted solely to agriculture and sericulture. The benefit to the people is far beyond a hundredfold, hence the saying: *\"Abandon the Sage and discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.\"*\n\nFilial piety and kindness are the nature of Heaven; benevolence and righteousness are human inclinations. Heaven’s nature arises from spontaneity and cannot be altered. Benevolence, loving all things, makes the people close to it; righteousness, fitting all things, makes the people praise it. When the hearts of closeness and praise arise, the harmony of life and nature is lost. The Perfect One abandons them before they arise and discards them before they become reality, allowing people to return to their original state and restore their natural simplicity. Thus, the *Dao/Way* of filial piety and kindness is complete. Hence the saying: *\"Abandon benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and kindness.\"*\n\nCarving, polishing, and intricate craftsmanship—these are the cleverness of things. Precious gems, jade, measures of grain, and scales of balance—these are the profits of things. If one competes for cleverness, they will not care about shame; if one pursues profit, they will not care about righteousness, giving rise to thieves and robbers. If one can return to their true nature and reside in simplicity, then where would thieves and robbers come from? Hence the saying: *\"Abandon cleverness and discard profit, and thieves and robbers will vanish.\"*\n\n**Master Lin** says: Once the names of the Sage and wisdom arise, the harm to the world follows. It is better to abandon and discard them so that the world naturally benefits. Once the names of benevolence and righteousness arise, distinctions between filial and unfilial, kind and unkind, emerge. It is better to abandon and discard them, forgetting them in the *Dao/Way*, so that all people return to the natural state of filial piety and kindness without distinction. Cleverness and profit give rise to thieves and robbers; it is better to abandon and discard them, as in the saying: *\"Do not value hard-to-obtain goods, so that the people will not steal.\"*\n\n**Master Li** says: This elaborates on the meaning of the previous chapter, where the Sage, wisdom, benevolence, righteousness, cleverness, and profit are all abandoned and discarded, never to be employed again. Then the people will follow their natural transformation and return to simplicity.\n\n**Master Lin** says: Some say that when the Old Master (老氏) abandons benevolence and discards righteousness, does he not contradict Confucius? Indeed, he traces the origin of *Dao/Way* to its source, asserting that though benevolence and righteousness, rites and music, can be used for governance, it is superior to govern the people through the *Dao/Way* and let them forget it in its midst.\n\nThese three teachings are insufficient as mere ornamentation; thus, they are given to those who belong to the realm of *Dao/Way* and *virtue/power*. To see one’s true substance and hold fast to simplicity, to have few thoughts and few desires.\n\n**Master Lü** says: *\"Abandon the Sage and discard wisdom\"* is the first; *\"abandon benevolence and discard righteousness\"* is the second; *\"abandon cleverness and discard profit\"* is the third. All three belong to the sequence of *Dao/Way*, yet they do not obscure its reality.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* cannot be spoken of; any speech about it is merely its semblance. Those who attain understanding hear only its semblance and lose its truth. Though they record it in writing and pass it down through teaching, they still fear that people will doubt its semblance. Thus, it is known but not employed, spoken of but not understood. To discard ornamentation and uphold simplicity, there must be another path to follow, so that doubts dissolve like melting ice. Hence the saying: *\"These three teachings are insufficient as mere ornamentation.\"*\n\n*\"Seeing one’s true substance\"* means purity without admixture. *\"Holding fast to simplicity\"* means stillness and unity without change. To guard oneself with utmost fairness, not to love external beauty—this is having few private inclinations. To practice moderation and control emotions, to be serene and content—this is having few desires. Thus, to govern the state in this manner, one can elevate the people to the realm of benevolence and longevity, the age of *Xīhuáng* (羲皇, the mythical sage-king of antiquity). This is not difficult to achieve.\n\nTo govern oneself in this manner: one’s spirit becomes clear and pure, unaffected by external things—is this not *\"seeing one’s true substance\"*? One’s spirit does not diminish, preserved in the chaos of unity—is this not *\"holding fast to simplicity\"*? In eating, resting, and daily life, there is nothing but fairness and correctness—is this not having few private inclinations? To dwell in the tranquil and distant, severing all entanglements—is this not having few desires? To exchange these for that, what is there to prevent?\n\n**Master He** says: It is not that the Sage’s wisdom, cleverness, and profit cannot be used in the world; rather, their names are mere ornamentation, not their true essence. If the world is allowed to settle in its natural life and nature, then these three can be dispensed with as mere names. The world not settling in its natural life and nature, while people only revere the names of these three and cling to them, is the greatest confusion. Ornamentation is insufficient; if they belong to the realm of *Dao/Way* and *virtue/power*, then it becomes reality. Hence, the Sage says: *\"Those who practice cleverness, wisdom, and the Sage’s ways, I regard them as having cast off the *Dao/Way*. Thus, I harmonize all things without calling it benevolence, bestow blessings upon countless generations without calling it righteousness, cover and load the heavens and earth, carve and fashion all forms without calling it cleverness.\"* Hence the saying: *\"Those who discard benevolence and righteousness are few; those who profit from benevolence and righteousness are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness is merely insincere, and relies on the tools of greedy and acquisitive people.\"* Thus, one person’s judgment benefits the world, but this is merely the false use of benevolence and righteousness. How could this be true benevolence and righteousness? It is far removed from the *Dao/Way*.»",
      "overlap_context": "ness is natural yet not known as *xìn* (信, trustworthiness). Thus actions are performed without trace, and deeds are done without record. From this perspective, the names of *rén*, *yì*, *zhōng*, and *xìn* do not stand, yet their substance remains—this is the age of supreme *dàodé*, the practice of the Great Dao/Way.\n\nWhen the *liúqīn* (六親, six relations of kinship) are not harmonious, there arise filial piety and compassion.\nWhen the state is in chaos and disorder, there arise loyal ministers.»",

      "translated_text": "「Yet the common folk fail to grasp its intent, deriding the rejection of the Sage’s ways and abandonment of cleverness as absurd, and scoffing at the abandonment of benevolence and righteousness as a deviation from the norm. Why do they not ponder the *Dao/Way*’s profound purpose, which seeks to guide all under Heaven to cultivate the *Hun-Cheng* (混成) *Dao/Way*? By discarding superficial adornments and returning to simplicity, they may attain their natural state. Hence the saying: *\"Hold steadfast to one and do not mix with another; govern the inner and do not embellish the outer. Clarity enters into emptiness, and non-action returns to primal simplicity. Embrace nature, preserve the spirit.\"* When one’s selfishness and desires diminish, they merge into boundless selflessness and desirelessness. Once purity and sincerity are restored, the *Jiao-Jing* (浇竞) of strife is naturally dispelled. Then, the radiant Sage has no need for artificiality, the subtle *Dao/Way*’s intentions require no contrivance, the benevolence of universal love finds no place to dwell, the righteousness of governance has no need to intervene, and the tools of profit and cleverness are set aside. All under Heaven thus blends harmoniously into the great order. This is the ultimate intent of the Sage’s teachings.\n\nThe common folk are unworthy to recognize this truth—how can they dare to lightly judge it?\n\n○ *Master Wu* said: The people of the *Dao/Way* outwardly appear as plain *xu* (素), inwardly uphold the uncarved *pu* (朴). *Xu* (素) is silk yet to be dyed, *pu* (朴) is wood yet to be shaped. Pure and simple, what need have they of artificiality?\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Absolute Learning and No Worry**\nHow far apart are *\"Absolute Learning\"* and *\"the One and the That\"* (唯之与阿)?\nHow distant are *\"good\"* and *\"evil\"*?\nWhat people fear, one must not fail to fear.\nVast and boundless, its end is beyond reckoning!\n\n○ *Master Li* said: *\"Absolute Learning\"* means abandoning the learning of ordinary people and taking up what they do not learn—rejecting the world’s learning. Common folk are only concerned with learning for practical gain, augmenting their knowledge, ever fearful that their progress in the *Dao/Way* is not precise. The Sage, however, discards all acquisition and solely attends to the flavor of the *Dao/Way*, thus having no worries. *\"How far apart?\"* means they are not distant at all. *\"How distant?\"* means they are too far apart. What people fear, one must not fail to fear—good and evil are indeed things to be feared.\n\n○ *Master He* said: This *\"Absolute Learning\"* is none other than the *Dao/Way*. Natural and effortless, it reaches the point of transcending form and name—this is *\"Absolute Learning\"*. One’s anxieties and thoughts should then be utterly forgotten. Though it is said there is no worry, what then is there to fear? Even without deliberate thought or outward form, one must still hold reverence and caution, for it is the resonance of *\"the One\"* (唯) and *\"the That\"* (阿). How distant they seem, yet in reverence, how slight is the neglect! Good and evil are but a single thought—how vast the divide between beauty and ugliness! *Zhuangzi* says that *\"the beautiful becomes lasting, the evil cannot be rectified\"*—how can one be too careful?\n\nHere, even within *\"no worry\"*, there are things to be feared. Though the Sage forgets the world, they dare not treat it frivolously. Speaking of *\"Absolute Learning and no worry\"*, the forms of *\"no form\"* appear, the sounds of *\"no sound\"* are heard, the tastes of *\"no taste\"* are savored, and the teachings of *\"no speech\"* are imparted. With *\"the whole cow in one’s eye\"*, what is there to worry about?\n\nFrom *\"the One and the That\"* regarding good and evil, the eyes dare not gaze indiscriminately, the ears dare not listen recklessly, the mouth dare not speak falsely, the body dare not move wantonly. To see a louse as large as a chariot wheel—how can one not fear? *Zhuangzi* says: *\"How small it is! Yet this is how it belongs to humanity.\"* This is the saying of those who fear what people fear. *\"How vast it is! Standing alone in its own nature.\"* This is the saying of *\"Absolute Learning and no worry\"*.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* reaches its utmost extent in effortless action, and its breadth is boundless. The *Dao/Way* begins with goodness itself, neither grand nor minute, neither arising nor ceasing. To seek its source, one finds it utterly beyond pursuit—what further use then for one’s mind?\n\n○ *Master Dong* said: It is vast and boundless, with no known limits.\nThe multitude bustles in joy, as if feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat, as if ascending the Spring Terrace to gaze.\nI alone remain tranquil, yet unseen—like an infant before it can laugh.\n○ *Master Wu* said: *\"Bustling in joy\"* is the appearance of harmony and delight. *\"Tranquil\"* is stillness. *\"Unseen\"* is like the faintest crack in a tortoise shell’s divination. The common folk who engage in learning seek pleasure in outward things, like feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat, which delights the palate, or ascending the Spring Terrace to view, which satisfies the eyes. I, however, remain tranquil and still, my desires yet unopened, with no trace of ambition visible—like an infant unable to laugh or smile, entirely unaware of the world’s pleasures.\n\n○ *Master Lin* said: The common folk take joy in the world’s flavors, like feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat or ascending the Spring Terrace to gaze, while I alone find contentment in guarding simplicity and stillness. My thoughts are a hundredfold unformed, like the infant before it can laugh. *\"Unseen\"* is form, is budding—this heart does not bud nor move, hence *\"unseen\"*.\n\nAn infant is born, and a child grows slightly older. The infant’s heart is entirely without knowledge.\n\n○ *Master He* said: The common folk are like those feasting on the grandest sacrificial meat, delighting their senses and bodies, or ascending the Spring Terrace to indulge in unrestrained viewing—bustling in joy, finding ample delight. I, however, am yet unseen, like an infant just born, before reaching the stage of laughter. One cannot perceive my head if they approach me.\n\n*\"Leaning and resting\"* (乘乘兮), as if having nowhere to return.\n○ *Master Wu* said: *\"Leaning and resting\"* means dwelling in things, yet having nowhere to return—it means not clinging to them.\n\n○ *Master He* said: *\"Leaning and resting\"* with nowhere to return—dwelling in things while the mind wanders freely, like riding the wind and treading the void, finding no place to anchor. One follows them without seeing their trail.\n\nIt is also said: *\"Leaning and resting\"* is like riding the wind, like driving the clouds—both are metaphors of riding the wind and harnessing the floating.\n\n○ *Master Lü* said: To blend with the world and move unnoticed, to merge with things and ride their waves, the heart fuses with form, and the body releases its burdens, becoming one with the spirit. Like a hollow boat drifting east and west, or a leaf fluttering high and low, one does not know if the wind rides them or they ride the wind. No one knows where they are going, hence *\"Leaning and resting\"* with nowhere to return.\n\nThe common folk all have excess, while I alone seem abandoned.\n○ *Master Lin* said: The common folk all possess a heart of seeking and filling, while I alone appear to abandon and discard—this means that in my pursuit of the *Dao/Way*, I have no heart of excess.»",

      "translated_text": "○ **Master Lü** said: The common folk follow what they know, drowning in wealth and honor, believing they have abundance in their joy. But the Perfect One is not so. He discards fame and profit like chaff, treats high office and lowly matters alike—knowing that both body and world are illusory. His heart is as empty as space, forgetting all things. Thus it is said: *\"The common folk all have excess, while I alone seem abandoned.\"*\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *\"Abandoned\"* means *lost*. The common folk rejoice in their abundance, but I, having nothing, feel a quiet loss.\n\n○ **Master Dong** said: *\"Abandoned\"* means *forgotten*—having yet not having. Oh, how simple-minded I am! Stupid and unknowing.\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The most eloquent in the world do not excel in speech but in silence; the wisest do not excel in cleverness but in foolishness. Those who act foolish all day do so because they do not deplete their spirit.\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *\"Stupid\"* is like the original chaos (*Hun Dun*), dark and indistinct, unable to distinguish—just as in *Zhuangzi*, *\"foolish\"* means without knowledge.\n\n○ **Master Lin** said: *\"Stupid and unknowing\"* describes the undifferentiated chaos. The common folk are bright and discerning, while I alone am dim and confused. The common folk are sharp and probing, while I alone am dull and obscured.\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The common folk expend their spirit outward, dazzling and radiant, seeking only to hear more, to increase their knowledge, to show off their learning—like parading the sun and moon. But the Perfect One’s wisdom encompasses all things, his inner light illuminating like a hidden treasure. Though he wears coarse robes, he holds jade within; outwardly, he lacks brilliance. Thus it is said: *\"The common folk are bright, while I alone am dim.\"* The common folk are strict and rigid, boastful and self-made, clinging to their narrow views, lost in trivialities, scrutinizing the depths of the sea yet unable to stop. But the Perfect One follows Heaven and the Dao, wandering freely, vast and inclusive, beyond measure—dim, silent, and unfathomable. Thus it is said: *\"The common folk are sharp, while I alone am dull.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lin** said: *\"Dim and dull\"* is the same as chaos. The common folk are bright and sharp, while I alone am dim and dull—this is how I differ from them.\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *\"Bright\"* is already clear, *\"sharp\"* even more so. *\"Dim\"* is unclear, *\"dull\"* even more so. The common folk take knowledge for wisdom, but I alone am ignorant and foolish. Drifting like the sea, whirling like endless wind.\n\n○ **Master Lin** said: Like sailing on the vast ocean, the wind howling without end—this is the meaning of *\"Leaning and resting, with nowhere to return.\"*\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: Like floating on the sea, drifting without direction, or the endless wind rising without rest. The common folk all have purpose, but I alone seem stubborn and crude.\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: The common folk all have purpose—that is, they know where they are going. *\"Stubborn\"* means numb like a paralyzed face, unaware of pain. *\"Crude\"* means rustic. I alone am dull and ignorant, like a distant fool. Those who dwell in bustling cities know much, while those in remote, barren places know little.\n\n○ **Master Lin** said: *\"Purpose\"* means *action*. The common folk all act, but I delight in seeking nothing, thus appearing stubborn and crude.\n\n○ **Master Dong** said: *\"Purpose\"* means *use*. *\"Dull\"* means *without knowledge*. *\"Crude\"* means *wild*. All people know the use of what is useful, but not the use of what is useless. I alone differ from them, cherishing to *\"feed at the Mother.\"*\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: This sentence summarizes what came before—from the common fear of excess to my own abandonment, speaking of how scholars strive for many talents, while I alone possess none; from my simple heart to my stubborn crudeness, speaking of how scholars seek much knowledge, while I alone know nothing. Thus I differ from them. What I value is the profound virtue of the Dao—the Dao being the Mother of all things. Thus it is said, *\"Feed at the Mother.\"* To feed at the Mother is like nursing at a wet nurse. Sima [Qian] said: *\"Nurturing the Original Harmony.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lin** said: What makes me different is my taste for the Dao—the Dao, named the Mother of all things. *\"Feed\"* means *taste*. To cherish feeding at the Mother is to value seeking taste in the Dao.\n\n○ **Master Li** said: The Sage abandons all things, attending only to the Dao, feeding at the Mother, guarding the feminine and embracing unity—thus there is no worry.\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The Dao is the root of all things. As fish depend on water—if fish lose their water, they die—what would happen if humans lost the Dao? One must know that spirit is the child of *qi*, and *qi* is the Mother of spirit. Without the Mother’s nourishment, one cannot live; without *qi*’s sustenance, one cannot thrive. Thus it is said, *\"Feed at the Mother.\"* If one continuously draws from this nourishment above and below, then the body will not decay, and the spirit will not be depleted. Hence, *\"Feed at the Mother\"* is most precious.\n\n○ Some say: *\"Purpose\"* is used to explain *\"cherishing to feed at the Mother,\"* but the interpretations differ—how can this be? It is said: Though the words differ, their meaning both return to *tasting the Dao.*\n\n**Chapter 21**\nThe bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The constant Dao is nameless; only virtue reveals it. Supreme virtue has no origin—it arises from following the Dao. The Dao is formless, but when it moves, it becomes virtue, taking shape. Never for a moment departing from the Dao, hence *\"follows only the Dao.\"*\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *\"Great virtue\"* is like abundant virtue. *\"Bearing\"* refers to what exists and is visible. *\"Follows\"* means *conforms to*.",
      "overlap_context": "rit. Like a hollow boat drifting east and west, or a leaf fluttering high and low, one does not know if the wind rides them or they ride the wind. No one knows where they are going, hence *\"Leaning and resting\"* with nowhere to return.\n\nThe common folk all have excess, while I alone seem abandoned.\n○ *Master Lin* said: The common folk all possess a heart of seeking and filling, while I alone appear to abandon and discard—this means that in my pursuit of the *Dao/Way*, I have no heart of excess.»",

      "translated_text": "---\n\n**All things derive from virtue.**\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The virtue that gives rise to this manifestation is born from the Dao. The visible forms and *qi* are the *bearing of virtue*.\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *\"Great\"* is indeed *\"abundant.\"* Those who understand the Dao follow it alone, yet even those who see beyond it possess the bearing of great virtue. *\"Virtue\"* (德) means *that which is obtained*—what one obtains within oneself is virtue. Since the Dao is invisible yet virtue is visible, virtue is thus called the *bearing of the Dao*.\n\n**The nature of the Dao** is but *dim and vague*.\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The Dao is obscure and difficult to speak of—what substance can be likened to it? Those who speak of its \"nature\" force a name upon it to probe its profound essence. Since the Dao is formless, from what can it be said to arise? Now, if one seeks the Dao through things, it cannot be obtained; if one seeks the Dao apart from things, it has no boundary. Examining its *dim and vague* essence, one finds that *dim* seems to be *having*—a having within the void—while *vague* seems to be *not having*—a not having within the having. Dwelling in the void is not void, hence *space is form*; dwelling in form is not form, hence *form is space*. Thus, the essence of *dim and vague* can be imagined. Hence it is said: **The nature of the Dao is but dim and vague.**\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *Dim and vague*—having yet not having—cannot be seen. Hence it is said: *dim and vague*. Within the *vague*, there is *form*; within the *dim*, there is *substance*. Within the *obscure* and *profound*, there is *essence*. This essence is most true, within which there is *faith*. Within the *faith*, there is *truth*.\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: The *form* within *dim* appears to have form, yet its source is nowhere to be found—thus it cannot be seen, nor can it be heard. If sight and hearing cannot grasp it, how can one measure the *obscure and profound*? To call it *not having* is to say it wondrously encompasses all things; to call it *having* is to say its form cannot be perceived. The *form of the Great Void* is having yet not having—from it, transformation arises, and all things emerge. The *substance of the Great Void* is not having yet having—from it, wind and thunder are born, and frost and dew descend. When there is *form*, the names of things are established; when there is *substance*, they arise from the utmost *essence*. Obscure yet deep and boundless, vast yet silent, *having within the void*, it encompasses the roots of all transformations, conceals the *essence of the Great Void*, and nurtures the *faith of Nature*. Thus all classes of things are born, and the Three Realms are complete. *The Broad Virtue Master* says: **\"The essence of the ultimate Dao is obscure and profound; the extreme of the ultimate Dao is dark and silent. Its origin is such.\"**\n\nThe heart is the palace of *dim and vague*, the kidneys the storehouse of *obscure and profound*. The heart harbors the spirit, the kidneys the *essence*. The *essence and spirit* of the body dwell within the *dim and vague*. Hence it is said: *vague yet obscure*, within which there is *form*; *dim yet vague*, within which there is *substance*; *obscure and profound*, within which there is *essence*. If the *essence* is refined, it weaves through all directions, wondrously uniting the body. In alchemy, it is called the *Great Medicine*; in the *I Ching*, it is called *Central Trust* (中孚). All changes cannot alter it, and Nature cannot displace it. The marvel within marvels, the truth within truths, it responds instantly when stirred—thus it can give birth in spring and cause death in autumn, never failing. Applied to the body, it ascends as *ancestral qi*, circulates as *Yi flow* (沂流), and transforms from yellow to red. Its Dao follows the seasons, hence it is said: **its essence is most true, within which there is faith.**\n\n○ **Master He** said: In ancient times, a scholar of profound mysteries expounded this chapter thus: *\"Form\"* is not always *form*, and *\"essence\"* is not always *essence*. Heaven obtains clarity through it, Earth obtains tranquility, and humanity obtains vitality. Those who can embrace the *mysterious* and hold to the *One*, seeking *essence* in the *obscure and profound* and *substance* in the *dim and vague*, achieve a perfect union of form and spirit with the true Dao. When one speaks of *form*, *substance*, and *essence*, all are within the *dim and vague* and *obscure and profound*—having within the void. Yet it is said that this *essence* is most true, and that there is *faith*—meaning there is no void without having, nor having without void.\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: Former sages spoke of the *void and boundless* without eyes, yet all things stood arrayed within it. From ancient times to the present, its name does not fade, for it surveys all *beauty*.\n\n○ How do I know that all *beauty* is such? **Thus.**\n\n○ **Master Lü** said: Since the dawn of antiquity, down to the present, it has ever existed, manifesting its power in each season. It has never been named, yet we force the name *\"true essence\"* upon it—enduring through the ages, unchanging, it is the eternal nature of the *One*. Sitting and observing the myriad beauties of Heaven and Earth, witnessing life and death’s completion, hence it is said: **from ancient times to the present, its name does not fade, for it surveys all beauty.** Yet all beauty undergoes ceaseless change—how do I know that all things draw their resources and endowments from it? **It is because the Dao reaches everywhere, thus it governs all transformations.**\n\n○ **Master He** said: This Dao precedes Heaven and Earth yet does not endure long; it persists through antiquity yet does not grow old. Though it is ever nameless, its name cannot be erased—this is the *\"Dao of the Constant\"* from the first chapter. It is called the *Dao of the Constant Dao*. Sitting and observing all beauty as it emerges, *beauty* (甫) means *perfection*—all perfection, for the Dao is complete. Hence it is said: **the void and boundless, yet all perfection follows it; this is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the Sage.** How do I know that all perfection is such? **Thus, by this Dao.** To survey all perfection is to survey all principles beneath Heaven—each must pass through the mind.\n\n○ **Master Lin** said: The name of the Dao is present in both ancient and modern times; it cannot be erased for even a day, yet all goodness arises from it. *All perfection* means *all beauty*; *survey* means *to pass through and observe*. All goodness comes and goes through this Dao. **Thus, by this Dao.**\n\n○ **Master Wu** said: *\"Does not fade\"* means *eternally preserved*; *survey* is *to pass through*; *beauty* is *perfection*—all things are *beauty*. Yet all things’ beauty varies with time and perishes; only the *Great Virtue*, arising from the Dao, endures from ancient times to the present, unchanging and unperishing. Hence it is said: **from ancient times to the present, its name does not fade, for it surveys all beauty.**",

straight**.\n\nRivers and valleys are **hollow** and low,\nYet water flows toward them.\nThough one might wish not to be **full**,\nIt cannot be avoided.\n\nIn humility and modesty,\nAll **virtues** gather to one—hence it is said: **The hollow becomes full**.\n\nThe **Perfect Sage** fragments his **virtue**,\nRuinously thins his body,\nMakes **Great Whiteness** seem like shame,\nAnd **True Authenticity** appear as flaw—\nThen all beneath Heaven gladly embrace him without tiring.\nHis Dao is ever **renewed**.\n\nThe *Yangzi* [text] asks: **\"How does the ruined become renewed?\"**\nTo **renew** is to **inherit**,\nTo **ruin** is to **augment**—\nThus one may be said to **renew his virtue daily**,\nWithout being harmed by external things—hence it is said: **The ruined becomes renewed**.\n\nThe Dao does not value complexity.\nThe more one hears and sees,\nThe less one adheres to its simplicity.\nThe **easy** is easy to follow,\nThe **simple** is easy to obey—\n**Ease and simplicity** attained,\nAll beneath Heaven’s principles are attained.\n\nThose who **master life’s preservation**,\nWith **few thoughts, few deliberations**,\n**Few desires, few fixations**,\nHold fast without losing—\nThus they attain it—hence it is said: **The few become many**.\n\nHuman nature loves victory,\nAnd prizes excess.\nYet the Dao does not desire excess—\nExcess brings **chaos and disturbance**.\nMany paths lead to lost sheep,\nMany methods lead to lost Dao.\nCultivating the body through **excessive thought** scatters the spirit,\n**Excessive scheming** drowns wisdom—\nThis is not the way to **embrace Unity**—hence it is said: **The many bring confusion**.\n\n**Master He** said: This chapter begins with **the crooked becomes whole** and ends with **whole and restored**—thus one sees the Dao’s **naturally unified Great Whole**, like rivers and valleys to the sea, unobstructed though they twist a million times.\n\nIt is not that the **crooked** can force the **whole**—\nRather, the **Great Whole**’s inherent nature transcends Heaven,\nAnd the **crooked** fulfills its forms.\n\nTo know the **Great Whole** of Heaven and Earth,\nAll is contained within me.\nYielding to things, harmonizing with their waves,\nI act thus in this world—\n**Straightness** cannot be followed directly.\nHow could I ever violate the Dao for empty praise,\nLike those of later ages who despise the **crooked**?\n\nThus, the four quarters are balanced and equal—\nThe Dao’s **straightness** is its core,\nYet **twistedness** preserves its **wholeness**.\nThe six **empties** flow freely—\nThe Dao’s **fullness** is its core,\nYet **hollowness** preserves its **wholeness**—\n**Humility receives benefit**.\nEnduring ancient times without aging—\nThe Dao’s **renewal** is its core,\nYet **ruin** preserves its **wholeness**—\n**Hidden yet clear**.\n\n**The few become many**—**Unity**.\n**The many bring confusion**—**Diversity**.\n\n**Master Lin** said: Only by mastering the **crooked** can one achieve the **whole**,\nOnly by mastering the **twisted** can one achieve the **straight**,\nOnly by mastering the **hollow** can one achieve the **full**,\nOnly by mastering the **ruined** can one achieve the **renewed**,\nOnly by mastering the **few** can one achieve the **many**—\nThese all mean:\nBy embracing **insufficiency**, one achieves **excess**,\nBy embracing **true emptiness**, one achieves **true presence**.\n**The few become many**—\nYet these three words are further refined into two sentences:\n**The few become many, the many bring confusion**.\n\nThus the Sage **embraces Unity** as the model for all beneath Heaven.\n\n**Master Lü** said: **Unity** is humanity’s true nature.\nYet the Dao’s **Unity** has many kinds—\nOne must not fail to know them.\n\nThere is the **Unity** of the Dao,\nThe **Unity** of **non-Unity**.\nThere is the **Unity** of the Spirit,\nThe **Unity** of **True Authenticity**.\nThere is the **Unity** of *qi*,\nThe **Unity** of **One without Unity**.\nThere is the **Unity** of Water,\nThe **Unity** of **Heaven’s One generating Water**.\n\nThis **embrace of Unity** refers to the **Unity** of **True Authenticity**.\nTo know **Unity** is to know **non-Unity**.\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor journeyed to Mount Éméi to meet the **Celestial True Sage**,\nWho said: *\"I beg you to teach the Dao of **True Unity**!\"*\nThe **Celestial True Sage** replied: *\"This is the most profound teaching of the Dao family.\nIts scripture is hidden within the **Five Cities**,\nAnd I have heard it says:\n**Unity** lies within the **Northern Pole’s Great Abyss**,\nWith the **Hall of Brightness** before,\nAnd the **Vermilion Palace** behind.\nMajestic are the **Flowering Canopy**,\nAnd the **Golden Hall’s arched roof**—\nThis is the **True Unity**’s essence.\"*\n\nWhen it speaks of the **Northern Pole’s Great Abyss**,\nIt refers to the **True Unity**’s divine chamber—\nLocated in the **ear’s aperture**,\nBefore the **Hall of Brightness**,\nBehind the **Jade Pillow**,\nBeneath the **Flowering Canopy**,\nAnd above the **Vermilion Palace**—\nThe **Vermilion Palace** is the **Dirt Pellet** [泥丸],\nAnd the **Celestial Sovereign** [天帝] is the **Uppermost Red Child**’s dwelling.\nIt is said the ears belong to the kidneys—\nHence it is the **Northern Pole’s Great Abyss**.\n\nThe *Xisheng Jing* [西升经] states:\n*\"When one attains **Unity**,\nAll affairs are complete.\nKnowing it and acting upon it,\nOne may follow the **True Authenticity**’s method—\nHence it is said: **Embrace Unity as the model for all beneath Heaven**.\"*\n\n**Master He** said: The Sage **embraces Unity** as the world’s model.\n**Unity** is the Dao’s origin—\nThe **Great Whole**’s naturally unified essence.\n\nNot self-displaying, thus **clear**,\nNot self-asserting, thus **manifest**,\nNot self-praising, thus **functional**,\nNot self-exalting, thus **enduring**.\n\nFor only in **non-contention**,\nNone beneath Heaven can contend with it.\n\n**Master Wu** said: **Self-displaying** is like **self-flaunting**,\n**Clear** refers to the **Spirit’s clarity**.\nNot **self-displaying** means\nUsing **obscurity to achieve clarity**.",

      "translated_text": "**Master Sima** said:\nDiscard the surplus of food,\nAnd thus one may avoid causing others revulsion.\nRemove the superfluous growths of flesh,\nAnd thus one may avoid causing others ugliness.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five:** There is a thing that blends into unity,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe *Taiyi* (太易) is the state before *qi* (炁) was seen.\nThe *Tai’chu* (太初) is the beginning of *qi*.\nThe *Taishǐ* (太始) is the beginning of form.\nThe *Taìsù* (太素) is the beginning of substance.\nWhen *qi*, form, and substance are all present yet not yet separated,\nIt is called *hùn lún* (浑沦).\nNeither clear nor turbid, it remains serene and ever-present;\nNeither high nor low, it cannot be divided by myriad streams.\nHeaven and earth arise from it,\nAnd all things transform through it.\nThe perfected one embodies it,\nThus returning to the root and recovering the vital breath,\nRestoring one’s original nature to its beginning.\n\nWithin the daze of *huánglǔn* (恍惚),\nTen thousand harmonies merge into one,\nThe true essence of all things is grasped,\nAnd their original form is revealed.\nBefore the heavens and earth were formed,\nBefore the *hún dùn* (混沌) took shape,\nThis is the source of the Dao.\nIn humans, it manifests as the nature of *miào jué* (妙觉),\nEnduring through countless *kālpas* (劫) without interruption.\nHence, it is said: *\"There is a thing that blends into unity,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\"*\n\n**Master Lin** said:\n*\"There is a thing that blends into unity\"*—this is the Dao.\nThe *Wuji* (无极) gives rise to the *Taiji* (太极),\nIts birth precedes that of heaven and earth.\nIt speaks of heaven and earth arising from this Dao.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\n*\"There is a thing that blends into unity\"*—the \"thing\" refers to the Dao,\nAnd \"blends into unity\" means complete without division or distinction.\n*\"Born before heaven and earth\"*—just as the first chapter speaks of *\"the beginning of heaven and earth\"*,\nAnd the fourth chapter speaks of *\"the time before the Emperor of Forms\"* (象帝).\n\nSilent and boundless,\nIt stands alone yet never alters,\nCirculates endlessly yet never falters,\nCapable of being the mother of all under heaven.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nSilent—without sound,\nBoundless—without form.\nEmpty and profound, vast and obscure,\nNeither past nor future,\nStanding alone without counterpart,\nNever changing or transforming—\nWhat could pair with it?\nThus it can traverse the eight *huáng* (纮),\nEndlessly adapt and respond,\nRevolving without error.\nAll things have rise and decline,\nThe Dao knows no limits.\nThings cannot see its movement yet it moves,\nCannot see its rest yet it rests.\nMoving then resting, resting then moving,\nLike an endless ring.\nThings, great or small,\nAll turn toward the Dao.\nObtaining it brings wholeness,\nLosing it brings harm.\nLife and completion depend upon it.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nSilent and boundless—\nIt cannot be seen.\nStanding alone yet never altering—\nIt endures eternally without change.\nCirculating endlessly yet never faltering—\nIt moves with vigor yet never ceases.\nCapable of being the mother of all under heaven—\nThe origin from which all things arise.\nSilent—utter stillness.\nBoundless—vast emptiness.\nIt speaks of its formlessness and soundlessness.\nStanding alone beyond all things,\nWithout equal or opposition,\nYet never varying or transforming—\nHence, *\"never alters.\"*\nCirculating through all things,\nReaching everywhere without end,\nYet never exhausted or failing—\nHence, *\"never falters.\"*\nNurturing all things—\nHence, *\"the mother of all under heaven.\"*\n\nI do not know its name,\nSo I call it *Dao*.\nForcing a name upon it, I call it *Great*.\nGreat—it passes away,\nPassing away—it grows distant,\nDistant—it returns.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nI do not know its name,\nAnd no name can truly capture it.\nSince it cannot be named, I call it *Dao*—\nA substitute name.\nSaying *Dao* is insufficient,\nI force another name upon it—*Great*.\n*Great* is also insufficient,\nSo I name it *Passing* (逝)—\nPassing, like the movement of going,\nCannot be pursued or chased.\n*Passing* is still insufficient,\nSo I force another name upon it—*Distant*.\nDistant—it cannot be approached or clung to.\n*Distant* is still insufficient,\nSo I force another name upon it—*Returning*.\nReturning—it means returning to the root.\n\n**Master Li** said:\n*Great*—without bounds or measure,\n*Passing*—without territory or frontier,\n*Distant*—without limits or edge,\n*Returning*—it gathers and brings back.\n\n**Master He** said:\n*Returning*—it means returning to the state of no-thing.\n\n**Master Chái** said:\n*Returning*—it means the Dao’s use returning to its original body.\n\nHence:\nThe Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nThe Sage is also great.\nWithin the realm, there are four *Great Ones*,\nAnd the Sage is one of them.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\nThe Sage refers to those who hold the position of enlightenment.\nThough the Dao is the greatest of all time,\nNothing can compare to it.\nThis is why, when speaking of heaven, earth, and the Sage in relation to the Dao,\nIt is said there are four *Great Ones*—why?\n\nBecause:\nHeaven obtains this Dao and thus becomes heaven,\nEarth obtains this Dao and thus becomes earth,\nThe Sage obtains this Dao and thus becomes the Sage.\nThis is how they become great—\nBecause they possess this Dao.\n\n**Master Li** said:\nHumans only know of the four *Great Ones* within the realm,\nBut do not realize that their own self is even greater.\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe perfected one likens it to oneself.\nThe Dao is the numinous and mysterious void,\nHeaven is the *Shén gōng* (神宫) of the celestial valley,\nEarth is the *Zhēn tǔ* (真土) of the Yellow Court,\nThe Sage is the *Yuán shén* (元神) of true nature.\nThe *Yuán shén*—this is the heart,\nNever departing from the four-square inch space.\nPenetrating heaven and earth,\nSpanning all directions—\nThis too can be called *Great*.\n\nHumans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows *Zìrán* (自然).\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe Sage is profound and silent, like stillness,\nSharing virtue with the *Yīn* (阴).\nIn governing, it shows no partiality—\nThis is following Earth.\nEarth is steadfast and unchanging,\nFirm yet balanced, like the center,\nSharing movement with the *Yáng* (阳).\nThis is following Heaven.\nHeaven is exalted and just,\nRevealing true signs of the Sage,\nResponding to all transformations,\nYet only virtue aids it—\nThis is following the Dao.\nOnly the Dao lets things follow their nature,\nAchieving effortless spontaneity.\nHold fast without losing it,\nAnd it merges with the numinous.\nThe Dao’s body is complete and free-flowing,\nEntering and exiting without hindrance—\nThis is what is meant by *Zìrán*.\nWho could say it is not so?\nThus it is said: *\"Humans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows Zìrán.\"*\n\n**Master Wu** said:\nThe reason humans are great\nIs because they obtain this Dao and align with Earth—\nHence, *\"follow Earth.\"*\nThe reason Earth is great\nIs because it obtains this Dao and aligns with Heaven—\nHence, *\"follow Heaven.\"*",

overflowing,\none nature pure and unchanging—\nreturning to the *Uncarved*.\n\n**Master Li** said:\nTo know *honor* yet hold to *humiliation*—\nthis is not to exalt oneself.\nTo guard the *female* and embrace the *dark*—\nthis is not to reveal one’s own clarity.\n\n**Master He** said:\nThe greatest *bright* is like *humiliation*,\nthe most *virtue* is like insufficiency—\nI would rather endure filth and misfortune,\nfor loss brings gain.\nThe terms *infant* (*婴儿*), *Unbounded* (*无极*), and *Uncarved* (*朴*)—\nall speak of the Dao’s return to its origin.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\n*Complete* refers to fullness,\n*Uncarved* is the *Great Uncarved* (*太朴*)—\nthe beginning of heaven and earth.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\n*Honor* means exalted nobility,\n*humiliation* means lowly abasement,\n*Uncarved* means raw wood yet to become a vessel.\nThe meaning of this passage is to preserve constant virtue\nand return to the original, beginningless Dao.\nConstant virtue is the virtue of *effortless emptiness*—\nthus, one prefers the *dark* over the *bright*,\nthe *female* over the *male*,\n*humiliation* over *honor*.\nThose who know and uphold it,\nthough aware of the other’s worth,\nyet choose to guard and remain in the lowly—\nwhen they fully embody this *effortless emptiness*,\nthey may return to the beginningless Dao.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"Virtue reaches its peak when it aligns with the original\"*—\nthe terms *Unbounded*, *infant*, and *Uncarved*\nall illustrate the beginningless Dao.\nWhen the *Uncarved* is dispersed, it becomes vessels—\nthe Sage employs it,\nand thus becomes the *official* of heaven and earth.\nHence, the great *measure* does not *sever*.\n\n**Master Lin** said:\nThe *Great Uncarved* is dispersed, and only then do vessels arise—\nwhat is beyond form is called *Dao*,\nwhat is beneath form is called *vessel*.\nThe Sage uses the *Dao* beyond form to govern what is beneath form,\nand thus all things between heaven and earth fulfill their roles.\nThe Sage governs the Three Powers to command all things—\nthough their duties overlap,\nthey still obey my will—\nthis is the *official* of all things between heaven and earth.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"The Sage manages the roles of heaven and earth\"*—\nthis is merely one aspect of the *Dao*’s governance.\n*Sever* means *to divide*—\nto govern things with the *Dao* is called the *great measure*,\nand when measured, *Dao* and *vessel* do not separate—\nthis is the meaning of *acting without action*,\n*effortless naturalness*.\n\n**Master He** said:\nThe *Uncarved* is the origin of the *Dao*’s effortlessness,\nthe *vessel* is the name for things that are shaped by effort.\nThe Sage cannot prevent the *Uncarved* from becoming vessels,\nyet skillfully employs them\nto manage the roles of heaven and earth,\nto lead the people and command all things—\nthough the *great measure* governs,\nit does not *sever*—\nit nurtures without harming,\nthe power of the *Dao* itself.\n\n**Master Wu** said:\nWhere there is governance, one must use a blade to divide the whole—\nyet the *great measure* governs by not governing,\nthus it does not *sever*.\nThe *great scattering* is not scattering,\nthe *great use* is not using—\nthis is also like the *great measure*’s non-*severance*.\n\n**Chapter XXIX**\nWhen one seeks to take the world yet acts upon it,\nI see their necessity as inevitable.\nThe world is a *divine vessel*—\nit cannot be shaped.\nThose who shape it will ruin it,\nthose who grasp it will lose it.\n\n**Master He** said:\nThe scriptures speak of three warnings against the world—\nto awaken the hearts of traitorous ministers and rebellious officials across ten thousand generations,\nthose who are blind to *authority* and *right*,\nwho transgress order and seize power recklessly,\nwho externally overestimate their strength,\nyet internally fail to grasp *command*—\nthese are those who bring their own destruction,\nand I show them their calamity as a warning.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Take the world by doing nothing\"*—\ndo not harbor even a speck of *action* in your heart.\nThe world is a *great thing*, a *divine vessel*—\nnot something human strength can covet.\nAs King Wen held two-thirds of the world,\nhow could he ever have had the heart to *take* it?\nAs Yao’s *yellow house* was not his own doing,\nand Shun and Yu ruled the world yet did not claim it—\nhow could they ever have had the heart to *grasp* it?\n\n**Master Lü** said:\nThe Sage’s possession of the world is not *taking*—\ntheir governance of the world is not *doing*.\nWhy so?\nBecause they never had the heart to *take* or *do*.\nThus they could harmonize with the world’s constant *Dao*,\nassist in the natural unfolding of all things—\nall things return to them,\nnot out of necessity, but willingly.\nIf one harbors the heart to *take* and *act* upon the world,\nwill they not rely on cleverness and force,\ncontradicting the *Dao* and losing its natural order?\nThe *divine vessel* is the supreme treasure,\nthe domain of heaven and earth’s *divine brilliance*—\nit commands all existence,\nsubdues all movement—\nindeed, it cannot be shaped.\nIf one pursues their own private gain,\ninterfering in the world’s affairs,\nbound by things and claiming them as their own,\nacting without knowing when to stop—\nthey will enter the realm of *worry* and *calamity*,\nnot only losing the highest truth,\nbut also their own authenticity—\nwhy bother governing the world at all?\nThe human heart encompasses all the world’s marvels—\nwhat is prized is its *naturalness*.\nOnce one acts upon it,\nthey can no longer remain *without action*—\nhumanity extinguishes the *Dao*,\nreverence destroys *command*—\nthe *Dao* becomes even more unattainable.\nIn its original form,\nit mirrors heaven and earth,\nharmonizes with yin and yang—\nthis is the *divine vessel*.\nThe Yellow Emperor gazed southward and lost the *dark pearl*—\nthe seven orifices were

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Thirty: Those Who Assist the Sovereign with the Dao Do Not Use Military Might to Subdue the World**\n\nTheir affairs tend to return.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nThose of the Dao who assist their sovereign must first establish virtue as their foundation. Armies and weapons are but the final means. The sovereign governs ministers with propriety, and ministers serve the sovereign with loyalty. If the ruler acts without artifice, the people transform themselves spontaneously. The common folk flourish in harmony, unaware of imperial might, yet they engage in warfare—how can this be the Dao?\n\nWar is an omen of calamity, and battle is a perilous affair. It is not the instrument of the virtuous. Used only when unavoidable, victory brings defeat, and gain brings harm. How can one justly subdue the weak or violently oppress the good? When beasts are cornered, they strike back; when things reach their extreme, they reverse. This is inevitable.\n\n**Master Ni** says:\nIt does not say *\"the sovereign\"* but *\"those who assist the sovereign with the Dao,\"* meaning that even if the sovereign harbors intentions of war, if the great ministers do not comply, he may not necessarily act upon them.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nTo assist the sovereign while prioritizing military strength is not to know the Dao. War is a cruel instrument—if I harm others, others will harm me in return. Thus, it is said that such affairs tend to return.\n\n**Master Wang** says:\nThose who assist the sovereign with the Dao still refrain from using military might to subdue the world—how much more so should the sovereign himself, who embodies the Dao?\n\nWhere the teacher treads, brambles grow.\nAfter great armies pass, there will surely be years of famine.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nWhere armies have marched, both ancient and modern battlefields, few reap lasting benefit. Fields lie fallow, homes stand empty, and brambles thrive—how can one not fear this?\n\nWhen great armies march, they disrupt the natural order above and drain the people’s strength below. Harmonious *qi* fails to ascend, and killing *qi* floods below. Both people and things suffer violence. The six *qi* become unbalanced, and rain and sun lose their proper timing. Plagues and disasters follow, and famine ensues after war—this is the natural course.\n\n**Master Su** says:\nWhere war is waged, civil affairs falter, and fields lie untended. After battle, killing *qi* surges, and crops wither.\n\n**Political Harmony Annotation**:\nThe people’s strength is drained below, hence brambles grow. The natural order is disrupted above, hence years of famine follow.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nIn lands where armies are deployed, farmers cannot till the soil, and brambles arise. After war, the harmony of Heaven and Earth is wounded, and years of famine inevitably follow. Thus, the virtuous act decisively but do not seek strength. Act decisively without arrogance, without boasting, without pride—act only when unavoidable, and do not seek strength.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nThough military strength and victory in battle are methods to suppress violence and quell disorder, they must not be discarded—like water and fire, their proper use brings blessing, but misuse brings ruin. Those who skillfully wield arms act decisively but do not seek strength. What virtue cannot transform and what governance cannot reach must be addressed only when unavoidable, pressed only when necessary. When they act, they do so without fail, not relying on strength to take what is not theirs. This is the clear path of virtuous victory.\n\nAct decisively without boasting of your ability—for boasting leads to decline.\nAct decisively without praising your virtue—for praise undermines true merit.\nAct decisively without growing proud of your power—for pride leads to insufficiency.\n\nMatters of aggression may be addressed, but not to seek strength.\n\n**Master He** says:\nVirtue lies not in waging war but in wielding it well. By *\"decisive\"* (*guǒ*), he means clarity of vision and firm resolve. Decisiveness is secondary to doing good, not to wielding arms for conquest. As the *Classic* says: *\"The contest is of heart and strength.\"* Thus, one acts decisively but does not seek strength. Again, it says: *\"Act decisively but do not seek strength.\"*\n\nTo not boast of ability, not to praise one’s deeds, not to grow arrogant—these are the expressions of a virtuous heart. Thus, one acts with decisive resolve, not competing in heart. Only in the matter of extreme military strength does one act decisively to reject it, not competing in force.\n\n**Master Dong** says:\nThough the Dao rejects war, Heaven endows the five elements, which cannot be discarded—like water and fire, their proper use is essential. Only when used to suppress violence and aid the distressed does decisiveness follow principle. Whatever principles and righteousness belong to us, we uphold them without bending.\n\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: *\"Decisive action means killing enemies to prevent mutual aggression—how dare one seek strength over the world?\"*\n\nDecisive action wins through principle; strength wins through force. Decisiveness carries an inherent certainty of victory, yet it does not rely on force or delight in war. Thus, when facing matters, one fears, plans carefully, and acts only when unavoidable—simply avoiding strength.\n\nWhen things reach their peak, they decline—this is called *not the Dao*. *Not the Dao* must be abandoned early.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nThe strong cannot remain strong, the arrogant cannot remain arrogant. Just as all things, once at their peak, must decline—those who do not understand this principle yet seek to dominate the world are acting against the Dao. Knowing this, they must swiftly abandon it. *\"Early abandonment\"* means to cease and not persist.\n\n**Master Su** says:\nThings grow strong, then decline—none escape this. Only those of the Dao, though complete, appear deficient; though full, appear empty. They never grow strong, never decline, never die. To use military might to subdue the world is extreme strength—how can it avoid decline?\n\n**Master He** says:\nWhy does the Sage retreat in humility, unwilling to seek victory over the world? Because He sees that when the sun reaches its zenith, it declines; when the moon is full, it wanes; when things reach their peak, decline follows. Is this not the natural course of the Dao? If one knows this is not the Dao, then one must swiftly return to it, swiftly abandon what is not the Dao. The causes of ruined states are many, but those who delight in arms are doomed to fall.",

      "translated_text": "With the Dao to govern the people and the state, how could one not take the use of arms as a warning and skillfully employ their consequences?\n\n**Master Dong** says:\nWhen things reach their peak of strength, they grow old; when arms are at their strongest, they meet defeat. Thus, those who rely on military might cannot fully preserve their virtue in victory. To employ strength is precisely what hastens decay and decline—all of which are contrary to the Dao. One should know when to stop early.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\nFine arms are instruments of ill omen. People detest them, and thus those who follow the Dao do not wield them.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nFine arms mean delighting in warfare, taking pleasure in using arms—this is the nature of an ill-omened person. An ill-omened person engaging in ill-omened deeds makes arms an ill-omened instrument, which the world detests. Hence, those who follow the Dao do not use them.\n\n**Master Li** says:\nNot using arms to subdue the world, those who rank arms as ill-omened instruments—this is the Sage’s profound warning to all future rulers of states. With non-action, purity, and tranquil governance, the realm naturally attains peace. Though arms exist, they are not displayed, and the scourge of contention is forever averted.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nArms are not tools for achieving great peace and governance. Though they may be used to punish tyranny, if one is forced to employ them, how can one avoid dark machinations? Those who adorn themselves with weapons as ornaments are already indulging in their cruelest use. This is to glorify a deadly instrument and hope for the world’s blessing—it is not only hated by people but also feared by all things.\n\nThe *Continuation of the Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government* records that Song Emperor Taizong said to his close ministers:\n*\"When I read in Laozi that ‘Fine arms are instruments of ill omen,’ and that the Sage uses them only when unavoidable, I have never failed to reflect on this as a solemn warning three times over.*\n\n*The virtuous in repose honor the left; in war, they honor the right.*\n\n*Arms are instruments of ill omen, not the tools of the virtuous. Used only when unavoidable, tranquility is supreme.*\n\n*To win yet not take pride in it, yet to take pride is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world.*\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nThe virtuous always honor the left in repose, yet in war, they honor the right—this shows that even the ancients regarded arms as ill-omened deeds, not something the virtuous would willingly use. They are employed only when unavoidable. Even if forced to wage war, they hold tranquility in highest regard. Tranquility is without relish, signifying the unwillingness born of necessity. Though victorious, they do not rejoice. ‘Not taking pride’ means war is no good deed. If one takes pride in war, then killing becomes a delight—how could such a person ever fulfill their ambitions in the world? As *Mencius* says: ‘Those who do not delight in killing can unite the world.’ This is the same meaning.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth places yang on the left and yin on the right. Yang embodies virtue, life, and gentleness—thus, in repose, it is honored. Yin embodies punishment, killing, and strength—thus, in war, it is exalted.\n\n**Master Wu** says:\nTranquility means without exultation; simplicity means without excess. To hold war in disdain is to govern supremely. Though victorious, they do not glory in it—war is no noble deed. If one glories in victory, then killing is their delight. Those who delight in killing cannot fulfill their ambitions in the world. This is the final admonition.\n\n*Auspicious rites honor the left; inauspicious rites honor the right. The Assistant General stands to the left, the Commanding General to the right—this is to treat war as a funeral.*\n\n*When many die, one mourns with tears. Victory in war is treated as a funeral.*\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nThe Assistant General’s rank is subordinate to the Commanding General, yet here the Commanding General stands to the right while the Assistant General stands to the left—this shows the ancients treated war as an inauspicious affair, thus observing funeral rites. Left is yang, right is yin; funeral rites exalt yin. Even if victorious, one should treat it as mourning, weeping for the dead with sorrow. The intent of this chapter is that those who seek victory in life are doomed to misfortune, not blessed.\n\n**Master He** says:\nTo treat victory as though it were defeat, observing funeral rites—this is the height of compassion. When the Qin army was defeated at Heng and retreated, the Duke of Qin wore mourning attire at the outskirts and wept toward the troops. This was fitting for defeat, but there has never been one who, upon victory, mourned in this way. Only those who deeply embody Heaven and Earth’s love for life and universal compassion could be moved to such grief.\n\nCompassion makes one courageous; sorrow makes one victorious. The Dao resides here. But if one takes arms as fine, killing as delight, and victory as beautiful, then one does not know the Dao, one does not know Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two**\nThe Dao is ever nameless. Though crude and seemingly small, the world dares not submit to it. If lords and kings can preserve it, all things will come of their own accord.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nThe Dao is difficult to speak of—it encompasses all things, penetrating the finest and the vast. How could it be named or compared to simplicity? Crude refers to its pure, unadulterated essence, one without mixture, boundless and all-pervading. Though called \"small,\" it is not small in size, but in its formlessness, its non-action, its subtle and wondrous nature—beyond grasp or imitation. Thus, it is named \"small.\"\n\nAll worldly tools and instruments, once named, are subject to the nameless. Only the Dao’s crudeness underpins all things—Heaven and Earth cannot violate it, sages and wise cannot interfere, and yet how could the world submit to it? If lords and kings preserve this crudeness, the world will naturally be governed.\n\nTo liken it to oneself: lords and kings are originally like unspoiled children. The unmanifest Heavenly Sovereign is called the Original Spirit. If one guards it without loss, one becomes one with the Spirit.",
      "overlap_context": "void decline?\n\n**Master He** says:\nWhy does the Sage retreat in humility, unwilling to seek victory over the world? Because He sees that when the sun reaches its zenith, it declines; when the moon is full, it wanes; when things reach their peak, decline follows. Is this not the natural course of the Dao? If one knows this is not the Dao, then one must swiftly return to it, swiftly abandon what is not the Dao. The causes of ruined states are many, but those who delight in arms are doomed to fall.",

      "translated_text": "The Dao’s supreme constancy is unassailable—all ten thousand *qi* bow to it. Hence it is said: **\"The Dao is ever nameless.\"**\n\nThough *pu* (crudeness) is small, the world does not dare to subject itself to it.\nIf lords and kings can preserve this *pu*, all things will naturally submit.\n\n**○ Master He says:** The phrase *\"Dao is ever\"* is a complete sentence, like *\"Heaven is ever true\"* or *\"constancy is ever true\"*—it means the eternal Dao.\n\nThe Great Dao is formless and nameless; yet, when forced to name it, we call it \"Dao.\"\nIts namelessness is the Dao’s eternal essence—*pu* itself.\nAll things that can be named or spoken of are not true constancy, but mere instruments.\nThus, it is said: **\"Heaven and Earth, along with all sentient beings, are originally rooted in the Dao, all emerging from the primordial *Tai Su* (Great Substance),

Great Chaos.\n*Pu* is subtle beyond measure—hard to know, hard to see—thus it is called \"small.\"\n\nThe Sage discerns the root of constancy and *pu*, embraces the Substance while preserving *pu*.\nThis is simplicity in essence and ease in practice, few actions yet great achievements,\na heart of non-action, safeguarding the utmost rectitude.\nThe Dao is both empty and real, void yet present—\nwith it, one governs the heavy and light,\nand may rule the world,\nyet how could the world dare to subject itself to such governance?\n\nWith it, one dwells in stillness yet commands

      "translated_text": "「Conquering others is strength,\nbut conquering oneself is power.\nMaster Lü says: Knowing others means seeking perfection in things,\ncontrolling life through external means—\nthis is not as good as knowing oneself without knowing,\nenlightening oneself without enlightenment,\nwhich may truly be called **self-knowing** and **self-enlightenment**.\nThose who strive externally conquer others with force,\nbut those who strive internally conquer themselves with the Dao.\nTo establish a state and proclaim a name,\nto grasp authority and wield influence,\nto command all under Heaven,\nto subjugate the feudal lords—\nis this not the use of force to conquer others?\nThe self-conqueror upholds **virtue/power** and **Dao**,\npractices **ren** (benevolence) and **yi** (righteousness),\novercomes self to restore propriety,\nhumble and self-effacing—\nyet people flock to him.\nThus, none under Heaven can conquer him;\nwhat else could this be but **power**?\n\nMaster He says: By human nature,\none is clear in knowing others,\nbut dim in knowing oneself;\nstrong in conquering others,\nbut timid in conquering oneself.\nSo knowing others is merely discerning right and wrong,\nadvantage and harm—\nyet a single moment of knowing wrong,\nand the **spiritual radiance** (*lingguang*) ever shines forth,\nthis is the greatest **self-enlightenment**.\nConquering others is merely a matter of strength and weakness,\ncourage and cowardice—\nyet a single moment of overcoming evil,\nand this is the greatest courage under Heaven,\nthe greatest **self-power**.\nHow far removed this is from those who strive externally but neglect internally!\n\nMaster Wu says: Intelligence can know others,\nbut this is merely external knowledge.\nTo know oneself is to exhaust one’s nature internally,\nthus called **enlightenment**.\nTo have strength and conquer others is to rely on external force,\nbut to conquer oneself is to internally overcome self,\nthus called **power**.\nThe contented man is rich,\nthe resolute man acts with purpose.\nThe steadfast man endures long.\nThe man who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.\n\nMaster Lü says: The accomplished man’s work\nendures after his death,\nbenefiting all people—\nhe does not lose his place,\nnor forgets his roots,\nhis influence lasts far into the future,\nso that later generations cannot emulate him.\nIn his body, he guards the **True One** (*Zhenyi*), embraces unity,\nand is not swayed by external things,\nnever for an instant departing from it—\nthen he enters the realm of the **Eternal Constant** (*Zhenchang*),\nenduring through all ages without change,\nunified with the Dao,\nthus it is said: *The steadfast man endures long.*\nThe Sage’s Dao is transmitted through ten thousand ages,\nrecorded in books and decrees,\nlater generations revere him as their teacher,\nthough his person may have passed,\nhis governance remains as if alive.\nThe man of the Dao regards life as a temporary dwelling,\nand death as his final return—\nin his life, he discerns the **tendencies** (*qù*) with clarity,\nunified with the Dao in truth;\nin his death, he sheds the mortal form and attains **spiritual transformation** (*shenhua*),\nlike a cicada casting its shell.\nThough his body dies,\nhis true self does not perish—\nhis longevity matches the **Two Principles** (*Eryi*) in its boundless extent,\nthus it is said: *The man who dies yet does not perish is long-lived.*\n\nMaster He says: **Self-enlightenment** through self-knowing is possible,\nbut one must also attain the **knowing of contentment** (*Zhizú*),\nthen wealth is not bound by the world—\nhis contentment is **Dao-contentment**, **spiritual-contentment**,\nthis is called **true knowing**.\nTo achieve **self-power** and conquer is possible,\nbut one must also attain **resolute action** (*Qiángxíng*),\nthen his purpose can overcome all things—\nhis actions are **diligent action**, **solitary action**,\nthis is called **true power**.\nThus, the two lines—**knowing of contentment** and **resolute action**—\nare connected to the preceding lines on **knowing** and **power**,\nand their meaning becomes clear.\n**Longevity** lies in not losing one’s place—\nthe place is the destination of return,\nas the *Yijing* says: *\"The **stopping** (*Gèn*) Principle stops at its place,\nand finds rest in its place\"*—\nit means that the power to stop is one who stops at its proper place.\nAll things and affairs have their proper place,\nto find it is to be at ease,\nthus **longevity**.\nTo lose it is to go astray;\nhow could it endure?\n**Longevity** lies in death, not in perishing—\ndeath is the meaning of finality,\nas the *Liezi* says: *\"The Dao is the source of eternal life,\nfrom life comes life—\nthough it ends, it does not perish eternally.\"*\nAs the *Zhuangzi* says: *\"A thousand years of life may weary one of the world,\nand they depart to ascend as immortals,\nriding the white clouds,\nreaching the realm of the Emperor.\"*\nThis is also the case.\nAs the saying goes: *\"Establish virtue, achieve great deeds, and attain the Three Unperishables\"* (*Sān Bùxiǔ*),\nthis too is the **not-perishing**.\n\nMaster Li says: The **contented man** finds joy even in poverty,\nthe **resolute man** never falters in beginning or end,\nthe **steadfast man** faces no peril,\nthe **internally enlightened** transcends birth and death—\nthe man who dies yet does not perish,\nhis **True One** eternally abides.\n\nMaster Wu says: The Laozi’s Dao\nuses **obscurity** (*mèi*) as **enlightenment** (*míng*),\nand **weakness** (*ruò*) as **power** (*qiáng*),\nyet this chapter speaks of **enlightenment** and **power**—why?\nBecause Laozi is not obscure internally,\nthough externally he seems so;\nnot weak internally,\nthough externally he appears so.\nHis **obscurity** and **weakness** are remedies for external affairs,\nhis **enlightenment** and **power** are prescriptions for internal cultivation—\nboth are practiced without contradiction.\n\nMaster Dong says: The **place** is as the **stopping** Principle’s place in the *Yijing*—\nonly he who understands the Dao and can act upon it\nfinds his own place and dwells securely,\nthus though external things change without end,\nhis heart never strays—\nthis is the way of **no entry without self-possession** (*Wùrù ér bùzìdé*),\nthe means to **longevity**.\nOnly he who can truly **know himself** and **strengthen himself**\nwithout losing his place\nattains true **longevity**—\nthis is the **unmoved** and **solitary** that does not perish with the changes of life and death,\nstanding alone and enduring eternally—\nhow could it be measured by mere quantity?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\nThe Great Dao flows unrestrained,\nits movement knows no left or right.\nMaster Lü says: It is the most exalted, most profound—\nits boundaries are unfathomable,\nits roots are untraceable.\nOnly the Dao could be so.\nIt encompasses the universe without distinction,\nfills the boundless void,\nits motion and stillness are unceasing,\nits coming and going endless,\nflowing freely without obstruction,\nwandering through all things,\nmoving left and right without restriction—\nits application is vast indeed.\nWithin the body, the Great Dao is the **original qi** (*yuánqì*),\npervading all hundred bones,\nin the joints when full,\nin the passages when full—\nflowing freely without exclusion,\npresent in every part.\n\nMaster Chai says: The Dao is the mystery of all things,\nits presence is never absent.\nThe text often employs the *\"fú\"* (*兮*) particle paired with *\"qí\"* (*其*),\nas in *\"Huāng fú qí wèicháng\"* (\"Vast and boundless, its limits are without end\")\nand *\"Pèi fú qí wèizhào\"* (\"Frail and subtle, its signs are not yet revealed\").\nAgain, in Chapter Fifteen, all lines use *\"fú\"* paired with *\"qí\"*—\nthis is the style of

**benevolence**, **righteousness**, **rites**, and **wisdom** are but aspects of **virtue** and **power**,\nwith the **Dao** as their foundation,\nand **benevolence** and **righteousness** as their application.\nThus, when the **Dao** is lost, **virtue** follows;\nwhen **virtue** is lost, **benevolence** follows;\nwhen **benevolence** is lost, **righteousness** follows;\nwhen **righteousness** is lost, **rites** follow.\n\n**Rites** are the thinnest of **loyalty** and **trustworthiness**,\nand the origin of disorder.\n**Preconceived knowing** is the ornate aspect of the **Dao**,\nand the beginning of **folly**.\n**Master He** says:\nDisorder begins with folly—\nthis is the utmost of how **rites** and **wisdom** lead to ruin.\nThe *Zhuāngzi* clearly enumerates these five stages from *“when the **Dao** is lost, **virtue** follows”*,\nand says: *“Now they make these things into objects of pursuit,\nand to return to the root is not so easy.\nHow simple it is!

      "translated_text": "Mr. Wu says: **\"Loyalty and sincerity\"** are the depth of **virtue**, gradually thinning as they transform—once diminished, they become **benevolence**; twice diminished, they become **righteousness**; thrice diminished, they become **rites**. Thus, the profound **virtue** of loyalty and sincerity grows shallow. **Rites** seek to bring order without chaos, yet they instead become the foundation of disorder—hence, they are called *\"the origin of chaos.\"*\n\n*\"Preconceived knowing\"* is akin to foresight—it refers to **wisdom**. The **Dao** is like the fruit of a tree: before its birth, its essence lies within, its embryo yet unseen. Once born, **virtue** is its root, **benevolence** its trunk, **righteousness** its branches, **rites** its leaves, and **wisdom** its blossom. All arise from the **Dao**. **Wisdom** seeks to be enlightened yet avoids folly, but instead it gives rise to folly—hence, it is called *\"the beginning of folly.\"*\n\nMr. Li says: *\"Preconceived knowing\"* is **discernment**; **discernment** is the first deviation from the **Dao**, hence it is called *\"the ornament of the **Dao**,\"* and those who follow the **Dao** do not dwell there. Thus, the noble man abides in what is profound, not in what is shallow; he rests in substance, not in ornament. Hence, one discards the former and takes the latter.\n\nMr. He says: To abide in profundity and not in shallowness means to honor **virtue** over **rites**; to rest in substance and not in ornament means to embody the **Dao** without relying on **wisdom**. The former is called shallow and ornamental; the latter, profound and true. Again, he says: This passage divides the six terms—**Dao**, **virtue**, **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **rites**, and **wisdom**—with **Dao** being nameless and **virtue** named. From **virtue** arise **benevolence**, **righteousness**, **rites**, and **wisdom**, each descent growing more refined, hence this chapter ranks **Dao** as first, **virtue** as second, **benevolence** as third, **righteousness** as fourth, **rites** as fifth, and **wisdom** as sixth.\n\nMr. Lü says: The sage, witnessing the **Dao** in existence, values purity and profundity, discarding superficiality. He anchors himself in sincerity, rejecting ornamentation. By abandoning the superficial trappings of **rites** and embracing the vast body of the **Dao**, the world is governed. It is like cultivating one’s life: returning to simplicity, earnest as uncarved wood—abiding in profundity. Walking where there is no path, moving without trace—avoiding shallowness. Emerging without gate, entering the boundless—resting in substance. Focusing the spirit, suppressing perception—discarding ornament. To abandon superficiality and take profundity—what could be more attainable?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\nIn ancient times, those who attained **Oneness**—\nthe heavens attained **Oneness** and became clear,\nthe earth attained **Oneness** and became tranquil,\nthe spirit attained **Oneness** and became numinous,\nthe **valleys** attained **Oneness** and became full,\nall things attained **Oneness** and were born,\nand the sovereigns attained **Oneness** to uphold the **Dao** for all under heaven.\nThis is how **Oneness** is achieved.\n\nMr. He says: In *Zhuangzi*, it is said that *\"the Primordial had neither being nor non-being, and the nameless gave rise to **Oneness**.\"* Before **Oneness** took form, those who attained it in antiquity placed it at the chapter’s beginning, declaring that **Oneness** as the **Dao** has existed since ancient times. **Oneness** is what the **Dao** generates; it is not called \"attaining the **Dao**\" but \"attaining **Oneness**,\" revealing the **Dao’s** supremacy—its singularity, unpaired, unmatched by anything. *Liezi* speaks of the \"uncarved,\" doubting the solitary; this speaks of **Oneness**’s essence. Hence, it is said: *\"Doubt the solitary, for the **Dao** cannot be exhausted.\"*\n\nMr. Lin says: **Oneness** is the **Dao**. The heavens, through it, are clear and manifest their forms; the earth, through it, is stable and bears all things; the spirit, through it, is empty yet numinous; the **valleys**, through it, are empty yet full. All things, through it, are born. The sovereigns, through it, uphold rectitude for all under heaven. Their attainment of it is what brings clarity, tranquility, numinosity, fullness, birth, and rectitude.\n\nMr. Lü says: Those who attained **Oneness** in antiquity—after the Primordial **Dao** had divided—were able to make the heavens clear, the earth tranquil, the spirit numinous, the **valleys** full, all things born, and the sovereigns rectify the world. There is no other reason: they attained the marvelous workings of **One Qi**. **One Qi** is unmatched; harmonized with the world, it is the child of the Great **Dao**, the mother of numinous clarity, the precursor of the Undifferentiated, and the ancestor of all transformations. Constant above and below, unchanging from ancient to modern, hence the sage draws near by examining himself.\n\nThe heavens are the rounded symbol of the head; attaining it makes the beard turn black, the eyes bright, the ears sharp—all senses become keen and clear. The earth is the true yellow field; attaining it makes one bear all things, nurture all growth, and remain stable and unmoving. The spirit attains it by chewing the six breaths, condensing the embryonic essence, and then transforming into numinous clarity. The **valleys** attain it, filling the brain and marrow, making the celestial **valleys** empty yet full, generating the true purple essence. All things—the six viscera, five organs, nine orifices, and hundred bones—attaining it make the seven fluids flow freely, the five entrails firm, the **Qi** harmonized and nourishing, thus enabling longevity and enduring vision. The sovereigns are the primordial spirit and heart-mind; attaining it elevates one instantly to sainthood, rectifying the form. There is no other reason: all is the work of **One Qi**.\n\nMr. Wu says: **Oneness** is the **virtue** of the void. In the previous chapter, it is called *\"embracing **Oneness**,\"* *\"being **Oneness**.\"* In later chapters, it is said that *\"the **Dao** generates **Oneness**.\"* All refer to this. *Zhuangzi* calls it *\"Great Unity\"* (*Taiyi*), yet also simply *\"**Oneness**.\"* This is the natural work of the **Dao**; its operation is empty yet not full, yielding yet not grasping, soft yet not rigid—all as stated in the previous chapter, now fully revealed.",

      "translated_text": "The one attained is called attaining this **Oneness** as **virtue**; the *yi* [以] is said because of this, one attains such effects. The clarity of Heaven, the tranquility of Earth, the responsiveness of Spirit, the fullness of the grains, the ceaseless generation of all things—how the sovereigns stand above the world—all are due to attaining this **Oneness**.\n\nHeaven, without this **Oneness** to clarify, would fear splitting. Earth, without this **Oneness** to tranquilize, would fear erupting. Spirit, without this **Oneness** to enliven, would fear fading. The grains, without this **Oneness** to fill, would fear exhaustion. All things, without this **Oneness** to generate, would fear extinction. The sovereigns, without this **Oneness** to uphold their rectitude and nobility, would fear collapse.\n\nMr. He says: Clarity belongs to Heaven. If one does not know this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, to clarify it, then day would be as dark as night, and clarity would split asunder. Tranquility belongs to Earth. If one does not know this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, to tranquilize it, then mountains would crumble and rivers dry up, and tranquility would erupt in chaos. Responsiveness belongs to Spirit. If one does not know this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, to enliven it, then Spirit would lose its responsiveness and fade away. Fullness belongs to the grains. If one does not know this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, to fill them, then the grains would not be full and would wither away. Generation belongs to all things. If one does not know this **Dao**, this **Oneness**, to generate them, then their generation would fail and they would decay.\n\nAs for the sovereigns, with one body ruling above the subjects, attaining **Oneness** and embodying **Oneness**—only then can they uphold rectitude for the world. If not for this **Oneness**, this **Dao**, then those in high positions would be in peril, those with virtue of two or three would face disaster, and the calamity of decline would surely come—how could one not be warned?\n\nRectitude is uprightness.\n\nMr. Lü says: Heaven is the accumulated **virtue** of Yang, symbolizing the sovereign. If it lacks clarity, then Yin and Yang would be disordered, the cosmic order would collapse, **Oneness** would not flow, and signs of splitting would appear. Earth is the accumulated **virtue** of Yin, symbolizing the ministers. If it lacks tranquility, then rigidity and softness would falter, mountains and rivers would crumble, **Oneness** would not be preserved, and signs of eruption would manifest. Spirit is the unfathomable interplay of Yin and Yang. If it lacks responsiveness, then calamities and omens would arise, and **Oneness** would not reside, bringing the time of decline.\n\nThe grains are empty yet contain all things. If they lack fullness, then the flow of nourishment would fail, and the fear of collapse would arise. **Oneness** would not be full, and the peril of exhaustion would begin. All things have form. If they lack generation, they would wither and dry up. **Oneness** would disperse, and the time of extinction would come.\n\nThe sovereign unites the Three Realms and possesses all things. If he lacks rectitude and nobility, then officials would not fulfill their duties, the four seas would not submit, and the calamity of decline would follow.\n\nMoreover, within a man’s body, the most Yang aspect shines above—from the Heavenly Pillar, the first vertebra, to the Jade Capital above the Heavenly Axis—all is Heaven. If it lacks clarity, then the marrow would diminish, teeth would fall out, vision would dim, and the form would decay and split. If his Earth lacks tranquility, then the true soil would dry up, the yellow sprouts would not grow, and the vital essences would erupt and dissipate. If his Spirit lacks responsiveness, then the embryo would wither, the prenatal sage would scatter, the seven fluids would not flow, and they would eventually exhaust and perish. If his myriad things do not generate, then the joints would lack vitality, the organs would weaken, and he would end in stillness and extinction. If the sovereign relies on his high nobility, then the Cinnabar Field would not be upright, the true nature would stray, the heart-shadow would become askew, and he would fear collapse.\n\nMr. Lin says: *Klie* [裂] means to split apart. *Fa* [发] means to move restlessly. *Xie* [歇] means to fade and lose responsiveness. *Jie* [竭] means exhaustion. The empty can receive; the non-empty stops and cannot receive.\n\n*Ju* [蹶] means to topple. To be in a high and noble position without this **Oneness** is to court collapse.\n\nThus, nobility depends on humility as its foundation, and height depends on lowliness as its base. Therefore, the sovereigns call themselves \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" and \"without grains.\" Is this not taking humility as the foundation?\n\nMr. Lin says: The phrases \"nobility depends on humility\" and \"height depends on lowliness\" are merely metaphors. Without lowliness, how could there be nobility? Without the base, how could there be height? Lowliness and humility are the foundation of nobility and height.\n\nThe sovereign’s self-designation—\"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" \"without grains\"—are all words of self-debasement, also used as metaphors for emptiness and selflessness. Is this not so? Saying, \"Is this not so?\"—how could it be otherwise? These two words are a marvel of literary style.\n\nMr. Wu says: This chapter speaks of six things in parallel, and below it elaborates on the \"noble\" and \"high\" from above, specifically addressing the sovereigns. The sovereign’s position is noble and high, yet the **virtue** of **Oneness** does not seek fullness—only by placing oneself in lowliness can one attain it. \"Lonely\" is like an orphan without a father, \"widowed\" is like a woman without a husband, and \"without grains\" means \"not virtuous\"—these are all unflattering names no one would wish to bear, yet the sovereigns use them to describe themselves, thus placing themselves in lowliness.\n\nEarlier, it was said, \"Lowliness is the base, humility is the foundation,\" and later only \"humility is the foundation\"—this is a concise way of encompassing both.\n\nMr. Li says: Is this not so? How could it be otherwise?\n\nMr. He says: Nobility originates from humility, height is founded on lowliness. Therefore, the sovereigns call themselves \"lonely,\" \"widowed,\" \"without assistance,\" \"without virtue,\" and \"without grains\"—thus returning to their roots without losing the **Dao**.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says: \"Constantly uphold **Oneness** in **virtue**, use humility to regulate rites. The steadfastness of constant **virtue**, the power of humble **virtue**.\" This is the Daoist **Dao** of the \"feminine **Oneness**\"—guarding simplicity while applying broadly.\n\nThus, \"attaining ten chariots without desiring chariots\" [致数车无车], originally \"attaining ten praises without desiring praise\" [致数誉无誉]—the character *yù* [誉] was mistaken.\n\nMr. Lin says: \"Attaining ten chariots without desiring chariots\" [致数车无车]—the original text reads \"attaining ten praises without desiring praise\" [致数誉无誉], where *yù* [誉] was incorrectly written.",

      "translated_text": "This passage is a metaphor, and if *yù* [誉] is used, the following lines—\"like jade, like stone\"—lose their connection in meaning.\n\nMr. Lin says: \"The term *shù chē* [数车] refers to the components of a chariot—none of which alone is called a chariot. Similarly, the *shù* [数] of my single body—none of which alone is called *wǒ* [我, 'I']. When the hub and spokes unite, it is called a chariot; when the Four Great Elements unite, it is called *wǒ*. To not desire to be like jade or like stone is to forget both nobility and humility, embracing only Oneness.\"\n\nMr. He says: \"To focus on *shù chē* while splitting over the distinction of names and numbers, or to fixate on jade and stone while favoring the extremes of nobility and lowliness, is to stray from the Dao of Oneness and origin. As *Zhuangzi* states: *All things are equal in Oneness—what is short, what is long?* Observing things through the Dao, what is noble, what is base? This is the way. Thus, the chapter’s concluding metaphor serves as a warning.\n\nMr. Chái says: \"The wheels, spokes, and other parts are the humble components of a chariot, yet without them, no chariot exists. Counting all these parts, none alone is called a chariot—hence, *shù chē wú chē*. Jade emerging from stone—one does not exalt jade over stone, for the longer it endures, the more it forgets its origin.\"\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Returning is the Dao’s movement; the yielding is the Dao’s use.**\n\nMr. Lin says: \"Returning is returning to origin, to stillness. Stillness is the source from which movement arises—just as *The Classic of Changes* says: *Gèn* [艮] completes both beginning and end. Only by yielding can one grow strong; clinging to strength alone leads to fracture. Movement relies on stillness as its function; strength relies on yielding as its use.\"\n\nMr. Wú says: \"The Dao’s utmost stillness returns to the Dao, hence movement arises. The Dao’s original emptiness returns to the Dao, hence existence emerges. Thus, the root of emptiness and indistinctness, the origin from which all things spring—bound by the mechanisms of emergence and return, confined to the realms of movement and stillness—these are the body and function of the Dao.\n\nTo grasp the true nature of things, one must uphold their origin. To govern the transformations of things, one must uphold their fundamental principle. Thus, when movement generates life, if one does not align with its transformation, one knows that emergence must return to return. If one does not align with its passage, one knows that movement must return to stillness. Observing things as they emerge, one sees they must ultimately return. Observing things as they move, one sees they must ultimately still. Thus, the heart of Heaven and Earth becomes visible.\n\nIn spring and summer, all things flourish in abundance, their roots and shoots bursting forth, their flowers and fruits unfolding outward—emerging and living. Is this not returning to movement? In autumn and winter, all things shed their flowers and bear fruit, withdrawing inward, returning to their innate nature, orderly yet unforced. Is this not yielding in use?\n\nConsider the body: to cultivate longevity, one must recognize the origin of life. To seek immortality, one must understand the mechanisms of emergence and return—this is called returning, this is called movement and stillness. Returning is the restoration of the true essence; movement is the activation of Heaven’s inherent potential.\n\nFrom the first emergence of *yīn-yáng* [一阳], within the stillness of definition, the pivot turns, the currents flow—grasp the meaning of seven returns, govern and supplement the Three Fields, circulate the Hundred Vessels. Without movement, one cannot restore life—thus, *The Returning is the Dao’s movement*.\n\nThe Dao is formless and soundless. Only the yielding can subdue the rigid; only the weak can subdue the strong. Thus, one must steadfastly guard the feminine and stillness, like an infant before it speaks. Moreover, nothing in the world is as yielding and weak as water—water is surpassed only by *qi*, and *qi* is surpassed only by the Dao. The yielding and weak of Dao-*qi*-spirit-water penetrates metal and stone, melts the sharp, grinds the hard—nothing it cannot enter. Thus, *The yielding is the Dao’s use*.\n\nMr. Lin says: \"Returning is the Dao’s movement—the spirit emerges and is immediately drawn back. Yielding is the Dao’s use—concentrating *qi* to achieve softness.\"\n\nAll things under Heaven are born of *yǒu* [有], and *yǒu* is born of *wú* [无].\n\nMr. Lin says: \"Only after Heaven and Earth exist do all things emerge—thus, things are born of *yǒu*. Yet who gave birth to Heaven and Earth? At their origin, they emerged from the Great Emptiness—thus, they are born of *wú*. Through movement, stillness, strength, and yielding, we speak of the beginning of *yǒu* and *wú*.\"\n\nMr. Lǚ says: \"All things under Heaven—*yǒu* and *wú* generate each other, alternately emerging and returning, without end. Without *yǒu*, one cannot reveal *wú*; without *wú*, one cannot generate *yǒu*. All things are born within Heaven and Earth—thus, they arise from *yǒu*. Heaven and Earth take form within the Great Emptiness—thus, *yǒu* arises from *wú*. When *yǒu* is born, it returns to non-being; when form is born, it returns to formlessness. The mutual generation of *yǒu* and *wú* is like a cycle, and the meaning of returning is profound indeed.\n\nThe Sage deeply comprehends this principle. Observing water, one does not watch its flow but its return-flow. Observing wood, one does not watch its blossoms but their withering—thus, though things differ in myriad ways, the Dao is evident upon sight.\n\nYet Heaven and Earth are the parents of all things, and humans are the most refined of all things. What is *yǒu* in us is form; what is *wú* in us is spirit. The embryo forms our shape—*yǒu* born of *wú*. The Hundred Spirits arise from the body—*wú* born of *yǒu*.\n\nThus, true *yǒu* is not *yǒu*; true *wú* is not *wú*. Those who grasp this meaning naturally harmonize with true *yǒu* and true *wú*.\"\n\nMr. He says: \"All things under Heaven are born of *yǒu*, and *yǒu* is born of *wú*—this is seeking the origin. Only after Heaven and Earth exist do all things emerge. Heaven and Earth are the first origin of all things. Before Heaven and Earth, there was the undifferentiated chaos—this too is the first origin of Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Wú* generates *yǒu*; formlessness generates form. When *yǒu* is born, it returns to non-being; when form is born, it returns to formlessness. Beginning from *wú*, it disperses into *yǒu*; ending in *yǒu*, it returns to *wú*. Thus, the Dao’s simplicity does not ultimately disperse into things. Those who drift and forget returning are destined to lose strength and stray far from the Dao.\"",

      "translated_text": "Mr. Li says: \"All things under Heaven are born of *yǒu*, and thus *yǒu* is named the Mother of all things. *Yǒu* is born of *wú*, and thus *wú* is named the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n\nChapter Forty-One: The superior man, hearing the Dao, strives and practices it. The mediocre man, hearing the Dao, is uncertain whether it exists or not. The inferior man, hearing the Dao, laughs at it—if he does not laugh, it is not the Dao.\n\nMr. Lin says: \"To strive and practice it means that upon hearing, one must believe. To be uncertain whether it exists or not means to both believe and doubt, to regard it as both *yǒu* and *wú*. The most vulgar and coarse of men will simply laugh at it. Only when the lowest of men laugh at it does one truly see the Dao’s exalted nature.\n\nHan Yu’s critique of literature states: 'If people laugh at it, one should take it as joy—how much more so for the Dao.'\n\nMr. He says: \"The Dao is natural; those who practice it can attain it, those who hear it can speak of it. Those who practice it diligently are the superior among men. The common man seeks the Dao without sincerity or depth, wavering between existence and non-existence, clinging to thoughts and intentions—one in ten thousand may achieve it. As for the vulgar and shallow of the world, though they may appear modest and weak, they laugh at the void as absurd, yet their laughter is insufficient to expose the Dao’s greatness, for those who truly know the Dao are rare.\n\nMr. Lü says: \"The superior man is endowed with pure and thick virtue, penetrating profound principles. Hearing the Dao, he instantly comprehends and believes without doubt, firmly resolving to practice it, fearing only that he cannot attain it. Thus it is said: *strive and practice it*.\n\nThe mediocre man is of moderate nature, capable of both high and low. Initially delighted, he later grows weary; at first diligent, he later becomes lazy. Hearing the Dao, he hesitates and doubts, unable to decide between acceptance and rejection. Though he wishes to advance, he lacks the resolve to act; though he wishes to retreat, he still hesitates. Thus it is said: *uncertain whether it exists or not*.\n\nThe inferior man is of impure and muddled nature, failing to grasp ultimate truth. Hearing the Dao, he deems it absurd and ridiculous, not only disbelieving but laughing and condemning it. Yet if the inferior do not laugh at it, how can it be called the pure and unadulterated Dao?\n\nTherefore, it is said: *To establish speech, the Dao appears obscure; to advance the Dao, it seems to retreat; the great Dao appears common; virtue’s height resembles a valley; supreme brightness seems like shame; vast virtue appears insufficient; established virtue seems like theft; true substance seems corrupted; the greatest square has no corners; great vessels take long to form; great sound is rare in tone; great form is shapeless.*\n\nMr. Lin says: *To establish speech* means to found doctrine. The scholars of antiquity, in their teachings—from *The Dao appears obscure* onward—have spoken these words. These are merely rhetorical devices, not original to me but found in the ancients.\n\n*The Dao appears obscure* means that only through obscurity does clarity arise. The previous chapter states: *Self-evident is not true clarity*, and again: *Not self-evident, hence clarity*. This is the same.\n\n*To advance the Dao, it seems to retreat*—retreat is true advancement. *Ji* (夷) means level; the great Dao is level, without distinction. *Rú* (类) means same; it harmonizes with the dust, blending light with the mundane.\n\n*Virtue’s height resembles a valley*—to be empty and not self-aggrandizing. *Supreme brightness seems like shame*—not dazzlingly distinct. *Vast virtue appears insufficient*—if one is self-sufficient, it becomes narrow. *Theft*—to desire to act but dare not. To establish virtue is to have purpose; to establish it through what one dares not do is how virtue is truly built. *True substance seems corrupted*—pure and unchanging substance, yet appearing as if it were ever-shifting. This too conveys the meaning of sufficiency without self-sufficiency.\n\n*The greatest square*—this is the boundless void. Though the void has east, west, south, and north, who can perceive its corners? *Great vessels take long to form*—like casting a tripod; how could it be hastened? *Great sound is rare in tone*—among the sounds between Heaven and Earth, none surpass the wind and thunder, yet they are not always present. *Rare* means seldom seen. *Great form*—Heaven and Earth. The *Yijing* says: *No symbol is greater than Heaven and Earth*—who can fully perceive their form?\n\nMr. He says: *To establish speech*—the ancients who founded doctrine, as mentioned below, were all ridiculed by the world, yet the great Dao endured. *The Dao appears obscure*—great enlightenment is like no enlightenment. *To advance the Dao, it seems to retreat*—great courage is like no courage. *The great Dao appears common*—equality is like no equality. *Virtue’s height resembles a valley*—substance is like emptiness. *Supreme brightness seems like shame*—purity is like impurity. *Vast virtue appears insufficient*—having abundance yet not daring to exhaust it. *Established virtue seems like theft*—established in Heaven and Earth yet acting like one who seeks fleeting ease. *True substance seems corrupted*—substance like gold and stone, yet appearing to decay over time. *The greatest square has no corners*—no doors, no rooms. *Great vessels take long to form*—uncarved, unpolished. *Great sound is rare in tone*—not in tune with pitch pipes. *Great form is shapeless*—separate from color, separate from name.\n\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless. Only the Dao can be freely given and fully realized. Mr. Lin says: *The Dao is hidden and nameless*—it cannot be named. *To give* means to bestow upon others.

      "translated_text": "「○ Master He says: *The Nameless*—cannot be pointed out and named, hence there are things like those described above that cannot be fully captured by words. Yet though the Dao is nameless, it exists and is truly good at lending and bringing to fruition. *Lending*—bestowing and applying through resonance, universally present in all beings, pervasively encompassing all things, like Heaven’s bestowal and Earth’s nurturing. The small fulfills the small, the great fulfills the great—what is there that is not the Dao?\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: The Dao transforms and lends to all things, yet the people do not rely upon it. It holds nothing aloft to claim fame, letting things rejoice on their own. Standing in the unfathomable, it wanders in the boundless—this is the Dao.\n\n**Chapter 42:** *The Dao gives rise to One, One to Two, Two to Three, Three to all things.* All things bear yin within them and embrace yang, blending the *qi* to achieve harmony.\n\n○ Master He says: *The void gives rise to Nature, Nature to the Dao, the Dao to One, One to Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth to all things.* All things arise from One and are fulfilled, receiving the subtle and wondrous *qi* and transformations. Whether it is beings or things, turning away from cold toward warmth, from darkness toward light, from evil toward good—all are expressions of *bearing yin and embracing yang*. *Embracing yang* is the same as *embracing One*, the Dao’s breath of life and its transformations. Man shares with Heaven and Earth as the threefold realm, yet among all things, he is the most responsive. Hence, man is Heaven’s trust of *shen* (spirit), Earth’s bestowal of *jing* (essence), and the *chong* (intermediary) and *he* (harmonious) *qi*’s nurturing. Man is precious in guarding his *qi*, preserving his essence, and cherishing his spirit—thus standing with Heaven and Earth, his means of sustaining the *chong* and *he*, to be modest rather than full. The *Classic of Documents* says: *Fullness invites loss, modesty invites gain*—this is the Dao of Heaven.\n\n○ Master Lin says: *One*—the Supreme Ultimate. *Two*—Heaven and Earth. *Three*—the Three Realms. All things arise from the void. The Dao is the origin of all things, the principle of Nature. Once the Three Ultimate realms are established, then all things are born. The birth of all things depends on bearing and embracing yin and yang *qi*, moving through the void’s harmony. This is how harmony comes to be.*\n\n○ Master Lü says: *The Dao gives rise to One Qi, One Qi to Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth to all things.* The reason the Dao gives rise to One is that the Supreme Ultimate was yet undifferentiated, a pure and undivided One Qi. *One gives rise to Two*—meaning that clarity and turbidity were divided, and thus Heaven and Earth took their places. As the *Yijing* says: *The Great Ultimate generates the Two Principles*—this is correct. *Majestic and resplendent it emerges from Heaven; solemn and austere it issues from Earth.* The two intermingle to form harmony, hence the order of humanity is achieved. *One yin, one yang*—this is the Dao. Saying *bearing and embracing*—they cannot be separated for even an instant. What can be separated is not the Dao. Those who cultivate and nourish understand that the moon is the mother of all yin, and the sun is the father of all yang. Therefore, those who bear and embrace should delight in absorbing Heaven’s light and chew upon the harmonious *qi*, letting the Heavenly Essence fill and overflow, the two luminaries intertwine, and all spirits rest in peace. Entering and exiting the primal transformations, they soar in pairs to the *Yuqing* (Jade Purity).\n\n○ Master Dong says: *For all living things, their backs face stillness*—belonging to yin’s quiet nature. *Their mouths, noses, ears, and eyes reside at the front*—belonging to yang’s dynamic nature. Hence it is said: *bearing yin while embracing yang*. Like plants, they turn their backs to cold and face warmth. The *chong* (intermediary) *qi* moves between them, and when spoken of generally, the spirit is yang while the substance is yin. The spirit moves within—this is *embracing*, while the substance appears without—this is *bearing*. The *qi* is yang in motion and yin in stillness, then balanced by the harmonious center, blending within form and substance, the mechanism upon which the spirit rides.\n\nWhat man hates most are *孤寡不谷* (loneliness, widowhood, and barrenness), yet kings and nobles take these as their titles. Hence, some things are diminished to gain, while others are gained to diminish. Master He says: *Kings and nobles who claim loneliness, widowhood, and barrenness*—do so by adopting the guise of being unsupported and unassisted. This is their name for self-humility and preservation.\n\nThe three titles are what man most detests, yet they are also what man uses to teach. Those in high station fall, the arrogant perish—this is the natural course. Yet within loss there is gain, and within gain there is loss. This is the changing nature of things. Hence, the Sage acts as the master of the Three Realms, holding the *chong* (intermediary) and containing the harmony, willingly enduring what man hates, willingly receiving what things diminish. How does he know that those who humble themselves are not exalted, those who retreat are not surpassed? Evil is not always evil, loss is not always loss. The *Classic* says: *The Dao is void yet its use is inexhaustible; fullness is its opposite.* The *Yijing* says: *What is great cannot be filled*—hence it is received with modesty, for modesty is the opposite of fullness.\n\n○ Master Lin says: *What man hates most*—nothing compares to *孤寡不谷* (loneliness, widowhood, and barrenness), yet kings and nobles take these as their titles. This is also an analogy for the Sage’s self-humility and self-abasement. Its meaning is that Heaven, Earth, and man all arise from the void. All things take yin and yang as their foundation, yet their means of birth are all the harmonious *qi* of the void. Those who study the Dao should embody this meaning, thus valuing the ability to be empty and without. In the world, some things seem to diminish yet actually bring gain, while others seem to bring gain yet actually bring loss. The principles of loss and gain are not fixed—like the moon, when full it wanes, this is gain turned to loss. When it wanes, it must wax again, this is loss turned to gain. What man teaches, I also teach.*",
      "overlap_context": "und is rare in tone*—not in tune with pitch pipes. *Great form is shapeless*—separate from color, separate from name.\n\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless. Only the Dao can be freely given and fully realized. Mr. Lin says: *The Dao is hidden and nameless*—it cannot be named. *To give* means to bestow upon others. Those with the Dao can give to others without possessing it themselves. *Realized*—the great fulfillment of the Dao, fulfilling self and others, and only then is it called great fulfillment.",

      "translated_text": "「There is nothing that enters the *Wujian* [無間, \"utterly seamless\" or \"void of gaps\"], and thus I know that *Wuwei* [無為, \"non-action\"] brings benefit. Master Lin says: The firm may be easily broken, while the soft endures forever. To act with the utmost softness between the firmest things is like water’s ability to penetrate stone. *Wujian* refers to the absence of seams or fissures. *Wuwei* [無有, \"void of form\"] is the same as *Wuwei* [無形, \"formlessness\"]. As in the human body, the *Rongwei* [榮衛, \"nourishing and defensive *qi*\"] circulate between the seams, and the *qi* and meridians flow through them. Even in the gaps where there is no fissure, sunlight and moonlight enter—these are all cases of *wuwei* [無有, \"void of form\"] entering *wujian* [無間, \"seamlessness\"].\n\n○ Master He says: Under Heaven, nothing is softer than *qi* [氣], and *qi* is nothing softer than the Dao/Way. The Dao/Way’s softness is its ability to envelop Heaven and Earth, to penetrate all things. Laozi once spoke thus to Guan Yin, explaining that the Dao/Way and *qi* are soft in this manner. The *qi* of Heaven and Earth, though as firm as metal and stone, penetrates everywhere. The Dao/Way is the same: its origin is subtle yet simple, its culmination vast yet firm and enduring. Thus, the utmost softness is not weakness, and the utmost firmness is not strength—like the cascading waters of Mount Tai eroding stone, or the hemp rope severing the *danji* [單極, \"single pillar\"]. This is of the same kind.\n\nTo \"drive and range\" [驰骋] is the *Zhuangzi*’s meaning of \"riding Heaven and Earth, ranging over all things.\" One who can wield the Dao/Way to govern existence moves from the utmost firmness to the original softness, from the original softness to the primordial *Yuan* [元, \"origin\"]. As in the *Liezi*: \"The body of *Liezi* is in harmony with the heart, the heart with *qi*, *qi* with spirit, and spirit with the void.\" By this, one sees that the Dao/Way is utterly seamless in its operation, and its subtlety is profound. Then one knows the benefit of *wuwei* [無為, \"non-action\"], where non-action is the return to the Dao/Way, stillness is the dissipation of *qi*, and the root of life is preserved by entering the *wujian* [無間, \"void of gaps\"]. One may attain this through silent contemplation.\n\n○ Master Lü says: Under Heaven, nothing surpasses water, yet even water is not entirely without form. Some things seem formless but enter into form—this is *qi*. *Qi* is inherently soft, and even though *qi* is soft, when nourished to its utmost firmness and strength, no one can resist it. To govern firmness with firmness, if it does not break, it will shatter. To govern firmness with softness, neither the softness is worn away nor the firmness is harmed. The Dao/Way’s ultimate softness is the same as *qi*. To range over the utmost firmness means that *qi* can penetrate joints and open passages—thus, the softest thing under Heaven ranges over the hardest thing under Heaven. When formless enters form, the formless is never exhausted, and the formed never sated. Only the *qi* of the Great *Fan* [梵, \"pervading, transcendent\"] is without form or substance, and thus it can envelop Heaven and Earth without boundary, and cling to the finest hairs without interiority. The sage embodies this, and his virtue/power is thus realized.\n\nWhen one sees the Dao/Way clearly, nothing is impassable—this is how one governs all under Heaven through divine transformation, likening the ultimate person to the *Qi Mu* [氣母, \"matrix of *qi*\"], refining and drawing forth the *Taihe* [太和, \"Grand Harmony\"]. Divine clarity resides within him, unrestricted in its coming and going, profound beyond measure. Thus, it is said: \"There is nothing that enters the *wujian* [無間, 'void of gaps'].\" The sage of *wuwei* [無為, \"non-action\"] dwells before the *Xiangdi* [象帝, \"Archetypal Sage\"] and in the midst of the *Taiji* [太极, \"Grand Polarity\"]. The Dao/Way’s wondrous application truly lies here. The sage follows it, standing without instruction, sitting without debate, moving with emptiness and returning with substance—nothing is impossible. How could this be a minor supplement?\n\nThe ultimate person practices *wuwei* [無為, \"non-action\"] and does nothing, yet his body is not weary. He forgets self and others, yet his essence is not diminished. He does not desire the Dao/Way, yet the Dao/Way naturally returns to him. Thus, it is said: \"I know that *wuwei* [無為, 'non-action'] brings benefit.\"\n\nThe teaching of *wuwei* [無為, \"non-action\"]—that is, the benefit of non-action—is rare under Heaven. Master Lin says: The first two sentences are all analogies. By this, one knows that *wuwei* [無為, \"non-action\"] is not the same as *wuwei* [無不為, \"doing nothing\"]. Non-action as teaching, and spontaneous action without effort—these are all the wondrous applications of the Dao/Way, and the people of the world cannot comprehend them. Thus, it is said: \"The world rarely attains this.\"\n\nBenefit [有益] means having practical efficacy. ○ Master He says: What is meant by \"non-action as teaching\"? Like Heaven and Earth possessing great beauty yet not speaking, the four seasons having clear laws yet not debating, and all things having established principles yet not explaining—when sincerity is felt, what need is there for words? What is meant by \"the benefit of non-action\"? Like using a boat to travel on water, or a sled to traverse mountains, or making fields from high ground and ponds from low ground—the transformations of simplicity, what need is there for action? This is all due to focusing *qi* to achieve utmost softness, and reaching the essence of non-action. The Dao/Way thus operates and transforms.\n\nThus, the world rarely attains this. Teaching without words, gaining without seeking—one who preserves sincerity and embraces the Dao/Way will have the world follow naturally. Who else could possibly aspire to this?\n\n**Chapter 44**\nWhich is closer to me: name or body?\nWhich is more abundant: body or wealth?\nWhich is more harmful: gain or loss?\nMaster Lin says: Name and wealth are external things, of no benefit to my body. Thus, even if one gains or loses them, what harm could they truly cause? Yet those who do not know the Dao/Way often trouble themselves over these matters.\n\n○ Master He says: *Zhuangzi*’s Bo Yi died for his name beneath the slopes of Shouyang, while the robber Zhi died for profit atop the mounds of Dongling. Though their deaths differed, both perished in vain, harming their true nature. The zealous martyr for name, the greedy one for profit—both sacrifice their bodies, and though they die without regret, they never realize that their bodies are heavier than all under Heaven, let alone that dying for name or profit could be a burden. One who knows the Dao/Way regards even the body as not truly his own—how much more so for beautiful names and beautiful profits, which are external things!\n\nThe unknowing try to compare name with their life’s fate, saying that name is like a flower, while the body inherently has name. If the name is high and the body is endangered, then is the name not distant from the body? They compare wealth with their life’s fate, saying that wealth is like a resource for the body. Yet even if wealth is abundant and the body is harmed, is not wealth then lesser than the body?\n\nThus, it is said:\n*\"Sheng wo ming zhe sha wo shen\"* [生我名者殺我身, \"Those who give me life through name kill my body\"],\n*\"Yi wo huo zhe sun wo shen\"* [益我货者损我神, \"Those who enrich me with wealth harm my spirit\"].\n\nAt the beginning, when there is neither gain nor loss, it is like water before waves. But when loss comes after what has already been lost, harm arises naturally—who could compare this to the peace of original non-existence?",
      "overlap_context": "ng a proper end—this is what is meant by \"gain turned to loss,\" and it is the foremost principle for teaching others.

      "translated_text": "Who could escape harm after what has already been lost?\n\n○ **Master Lü** says: To prioritize the body over name and value the body above wealth is still not to forget oneself. But he who forgets himself does not even possess the body—how much less does he possess name and wealth!\n\nIndeed, name without substance is hollow, and substance without name is true. The noble man toils night and day, pondering good and ill, yet even his form grows thin. The wealthy man exhausts his body with labor, competing for fame and hoarding wealth, yet cannot enjoy it all—his form becomes but an alien vessel.\n\nYet the sage values the body as the foundation for all under Heaven, not through forgetting himself, but by making all under Heaven know that name is insufficient for intimacy and wealth is insufficient for abundance. Thus, **Bò Yì** starved to death beneath Chief Yang’s slope, a sacrifice to name. **Zhóu Jī** died upon the Eastern Ridge, a sacrifice to profit.\n\nBetween name and wealth, which is more abundant, which is less? To sacrifice the body for name, the world will call him a **gentleman**; to sacrifice the body for profit, the world will call him a **villain**. Gain brings joy, loss brings sorrow; covetousness of gain forgets loss, and greed for profit forgets righteousness. This is like using **Duke Sui’s pearl** to shoot a thousand-foot-high sparrow—though one may strike the bird, the pearl is already lost. Truly, what is lost is heavy, what is gained is light—how lamentable!\n\nThe disease lies in desiring what one cannot obtain; when one has already gained but fears losing it, the disease is even worse than the loss itself. Only when one attains **equanimity between having and lacking**, and accepts both gain and loss with balance, does true peace begin.\n\nTherefore, **excessive love leads to great expenditure**, and **hoarding wealth brings heavy loss**. ○ **Master Lín** says: Love clings to something, so one must inevitably exhaust mind and strength in seeking it—love grows greater, so does the exhaustion. This speaks of name. Greed leads to hoarding, and when loss comes one day, it will be great. If one hoards nothing, one loses nothing; if one hoards little, one loses little. Only through much hoarding does one invite much loss—these two lines illuminate the next three.\n\n○ **Master Hé** says: To crave fine names is called **excessive love**; name is but a guest to substance, so the greater the name, the greater the mental strain. To dwell on rare wealth is called **hoarding**; profit is the catalyst for chaos, so the thicker the wealth, the greater the loss of what is truly valuable.\n\n○ **Master Wú** says: Love refers to love of name; great refers to the body. Comparing name to the body, the body is greater than name. Those who admire name love it excessively, yet love of the body is not as fervent as love of name—this will inevitably drain the mind and shorten life. Thus, it is said: **great expenditure**. Hoarding refers to hoarding wealth; great also refers to the body. Comparing wealth to the body, the body is more substantial than wealth. Those who crave wealth hoard it excessively, yet those who value the body do not weigh it as heavily as those who value wealth—this will inevitably lead to the loss of life and premature death. Thus, it is said: **heavy loss**.\n\nTo know sufficiency is to avoid disgrace; to know restraint is to avoid peril—thus one may endure long.\n\n○ **Master Lín** says: Only he who knows sufficiency does not fall into self-disgrace; only he who knows restraint does not court danger—thus he may endure long. These three lines are timeless wisdom, never exhausted by ages past or future.\n\n○ **Master Hé** says: To know sufficiency means recognizing the proper measure in what one has already gained in name and profit, so that the body may early withdraw from strife—what disgrace could there be? To know restraint means refusing even a hair’s breadth of what one ought not to possess in name and profit, so that the body may remain hidden—what peril could there be? Only then may one endure long.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says: A contented heart seeks nothing beyond itself, so there is no disgrace. A still mind extinguishes all entanglements, so there is no peril—thus one may endure long, may endure forever.\n\n○ **Master Wú** says: To know the fixed measure within oneself, then one is sufficient without greed, and does not fall into disgrace through reckless actions or loss of integrity. To know that external things bring no true benefit, then one restrains without seeking, and does not court peril through depletion of life or premature death—thus one may endure long.\n\n○ **Master Lǐ** says: Name and wealth, gain and loss—all are matters of **artifice**. They never endure long. Only to know sufficiency and restraint may one endure long.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five**\nGreat fulfillment seems like a lack, yet its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat abundance seems like emptiness, yet its use is endless.\nGreat rectitude seems like bending, great skill seems like clumsiness, great eloquence seems like stammering.\n\n○ **Master Lín** says: Fulfillment brings lack; great fulfillment is always as if lacking, so its use is inexhaustible. Abundance brings emptiness; great abundance is always as if empty, so its use is endless. The previous chapter states: \"Hollow brings abundance, worn-out brings renewal\"—this is the same meaning. Great rectitude is always as if bent; what seems crooked is straight, what seems curved is whole. Great skill is always as if clumsy; it does not boast of itself. Great eloquence is always as if stammering; it does not force speech.\n\n○ **Master Lǐ** says: The previous chapter speaks of knowing sufficiency to avoid disgrace, so it follows with *great fulfillment seems like a lack*—virtue in excess appears as deficiency, life in excess appears as poverty. Great fulfillment as lack, great abundance as emptiness, even to the point of seeming bent, clumsy, or stammering—all are virtue in excess appearing as deficiency. Its use is without end.\n\n○ **Master Wú** says: To fulfill as fulfillment, to be abundant as abundance, to be straight as straight, to be skillful as skill, to be eloquent as eloquence—this is small. But to lack and not be fulfillment, to be empty and not be abundance, to bend and not be straight, to be clumsy and not be skillful, to stammer and not be eloquence—this is the greatness of fulfillment, abundance, straightness, skill, and eloquence.\n\nAgitation conquers cold, stillness conquers heat—**clearing and tranquility** are the true norm for all under Heaven.\n\n○ **Master Lín** says: Agitation’s peak is cold, stillness’s peak is heat—agitation and stillness are but the two forces of **yin and yang**. When **qi** stagnates in one extreme, it becomes illness; only **Dao’s** clearing and tranquility, neither having nor lacking, neither moving nor still, is the true norm for all under Heaven.",

      "translated_text": "○ **Master Hé** says: The Dao’s norm is **clearing and tranquility**, and it is only through **clearing and tranquility** that greatness is attained. Agitation conquers cold, yet when **yang** reaches its extreme, **yin** arises; stillness conquers heat, yet when **yin** reaches its extreme, **yang** arises. All extremes arise from one-sided dominance. But when Heaven is clear and Earth is tranquil, this is the supreme norm for all under Heaven—neither dominance nor extremity—yet it is vast and enduring. The Classic says: *\"If one can always maintain **clearing and tranquility**, all under Heaven will naturally return to this.\"*\n\n**Laozi’s *Zhāngyì* (Collected Commentaries), Volume 6 complete.**\n**Laozi’s *Zhāngyì*, Volume 7.**\n**Jūjiāng Wēi Dàyǒu’s *Collection*, Chapter 46.**\n\n*\"When the Dao prevails in the world, even swift horses are turned aside to spread manure.\nWhen the Dao does not prevail, warhorses are bred in the suburbs.\"*\n\n**Master Lǚ** says: In times of prosperity, the common people flourish, the seas are at peace, weapons are laid aside, and the people diligently till the land, competing in agriculture and sericulture. Their manure enriches the fields—though fine horses exist, they serve no martial purpose. How could this not be called the Dao?\n\nIn times of decline, all affairs falter, calamities arise, and the strong oppress the weak. Boundaries are contested, and the seeds of war take root. Warhorses gallop across battlefields, blocking the flow of **yin and yang** and stunting the growth of all things. How could this not be called the absence of the Dao?\n\nFor the body is but a microcosm of the world. The *Nánhuá Jīng* (Zhuangzi) speaks of wild horses and dust—thus, horses symbolize **qi**.\n\n**Yang Zi** says: **Qi** is like a horse that carries one toward good or evil. Indeed, **qi** is the Dao, and the Dao is **qi**. From the One **qi**, all things arise; where **qi** lingers, things grow soft and weak, and where it departs, things harden and die.\n\n*\"However\"*—the word *\"however\"* (却) means to reverse, *\"walk\"* (走) means to circulate. Circulating refined **qi** upward against the flow nourishes the brain’s blood and fertilizes the roots, thus nourishing the body. Hence: *\"When the Dao prevails in the world, even swift horses are turned aside to spread manure.\"*\n\nWhen the Dao does not prevail, one abandons roots for external pursuits, the mind agitates, and breath races upward—through the upper orifices, it disperses in great waves; from below, the **jing** (essence) leaks away in a steady drip. Daily, the heart battles, and the six evils (of excess) arise at the borders.\n\n○ **Master Hé** says: When a ruler of the Dao governs the world, he does not use military might to dominate others but instead prioritizes agriculture and grain. Thus, even swift horses are turned aside to fertilize the fields, never neglecting the inner for the outer.\n\nThe Classic says: *\"Remove the filth from one’s ancestral home, and all will be restored.\"* To spread manure is to mend what has decayed.\n\nIn a world without the Dao, warhorses are bred in the suburbs—\n*Stallions prance in the boundless wilds.*\n\nThe suburbs originally refer to lands where horses are raised; if such lands obstruct farming, it is a warning.\n\n○ According to **Master Wú Chéng’s** annotated edition, the original text reads: *\"When the Dao prevails in the world, even swift horses are turned aside to spread manure [with carts].\"* In an age of the Dao, there is no mutual invasion, so fine horses are not harnessed to war chariots but instead pulled lowly manure carts to fertilize the fields. Other commentaries omit the character *\"cart\"* (车), but **Huì’ān’s** *Júzǐ Yúlù* (Zhu Xi’s Dialogues) includes it. **Zhang Heng’s** *Dōngjīng Fù* (Eastern Capital Eulogy) states: *\"Swift horses are turned aside to pull manure carts,\"* using Laozi’s full line. **Master Wú’s** edition is well-reasoned—scholars must not overlook it.\n\nNo greater crime exists than desiring what one should not,\nNo greater fault than grasping what one desires,\nNo greater calamity than failing to know sufficiency—\nThus, the sufficiency of *\"knowing sufficiency\"* is eternal sufficiency.\n\n**Master Lín** says: Wars all begin from the seed of desire. Once desire takes root, when will it ever be enough? Only by attending to what is essential does one avoid crime, calamity, and fault.\n\nOnly those who regard insufficiency as sufficiency remain truly sufficient. This further illuminates the previous chapter’s meaning: *\"Knowing sufficiency brings no disgrace.\"*\n\n○ **Master Wú** says: *\"Crime\"* refers to transgressions, *\"fault\"* to misfortune, and *\"calamity\"* to disaster—yet calamity is graver than fault. To covet the Rampart Pass and still long for Shù is the failure to know sufficiency.\n\n○ **Master Lǐ** says: *\"Crime,\" \"fault,\"* and *\"calamity\"* all stem from desire. Hence the conclusion: *\"Knowing sufficiency, one is always sufficient.\"* For the contented poor find joy in poverty.\n\n**Chapter 47.**\n*\"Without stepping outside, one knows all under Heaven.\"*",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 48.**\n\n*\"Without peering through the window, one perceives the Dao of Heaven.*\n*The farther one goes, the less one knows.*\n**Master Hé** says: Laozi spoke to Wenzi: *\"Qi and spirit arise from within; spirit and qi move with Heaven. This speaks solely of how spirit alone can foreknow.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lǐ** says: *\"Without stepping outside, one knows all under Heaven\"*—this means those who follow the Way know the inner and not the outer. Knowing the inner while ignoring the outer means knowing nothing; seeing the inner while ignoring the outer means seeing nothing. But if one only knows the outer and sees the outer while forgetting the inner, then one’s knowledge and perception are shallow and narrow.\n\n○ **Master Wú** says: The principles of all things and affairs under Heaven are already complete within oneself. Thus, even without stepping outside, one knows them all. The Dao of Heaven is the root of all principles; it is grasped through inner observation, not like external, tangible things that must be glimpsed through a window. Those who do not realize that all is already within themselves must travel far to know even a single matter. Hence, the farther one goes, the less one knows—how could one ever know all under Heaven without stepping outside?\n\n○ **Master Lín** says: Though Heaven and Earth are vast, human nature and the principles of things are fundamentally one. Even without stepping outside, one may know them. Though yin and yang transform, their patterns endure through the ages—visible even without peering through a window. If one insists on seeking them externally, how much can one truly know from where one’s feet tread? How much can one truly see with one’s own strength? The more one labors, the more one’s mind grows dim. Thus it is said: *\"The farther one goes, the less one knows.\"*\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without moving yet knows, sees without looking yet understands, does without doing yet achieves. **Master Hé** says: One does not guess at others through conjecture but knows them through the Way. One does not probe Heaven through speculation but perceives it through the Way. Others are myself; myself is Heaven. If one must wait to step outside and peer through a window, then one abandons the mind for the external. When spirit is insufficient, how can knowledge and perception suffice? What relation does this have to the Way? The *Yijing* says: *\"No thought, no action. Still and unmoving, yet responsive—thus one attains the patterns of all under Heaven.\"* Who but the most divine of all under Heaven could comprehend this? It further says: *\"Only the divine moves swiftly without haste, arrives without traveling.\"* This is the Way of not acting yet reaching, not seeing yet knowing, not doing yet achieving.\n\n○ **Master Lín** says: The Sage arrives without moving, understands without seeking, achieves without doing—such is the Way’s function. The *Yijing* says: *\"Swift without haste, arriving without traveling\"*—this is its meaning.\n\n○ **Master Wú** says: It is not that one does not travel to places, but that one arrives at them all as if present. Thus one thoroughly knows all under Heaven’s affairs. It is not that one does not observe things before understanding their principles, but that one perceives the Dao of Heaven without peering through a window. *\"To do without doing\"*—this verifies the previous two sentences. Only because one does not act yet knows all matters, does not observe yet penetrates the root, does one achieve without effort.\n\n**Chapter 48.**\n*\"The more one studies, the more one gains.\nThe more one follows the Dao, the more one diminishes.\nDiminish again and again,\nuntil one reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing remains undone.\"*\n\n**Master Hé** says: A thousand days of studying wisdom cannot compare to a single day of studying the Dao. It is not that one studies the Dao to learn, nor that the Dao teaches itself. Learning expands knowledge and perception; only through accumulation does it take form. The Dao, however, transcends knowledge and perception—it is originally complete. Learning seeks the Dao; extensive study leads to simplicity. Through diligent practice of non-action, one awakens to the true Dao. First, one gains before diminishing; then, one enters emptiness. Having diminished again and again, even emptiness is emptiness—only then does one align with the true Dao. This is the wondrous realm of non-action.\n\nLaozi spoke to Wenzi: *\"Non-action does not mean resisting what must respond or remaining unmoved when stirred. It is not rigid stagnation but flowing with principle while acting, seizing the moment to establish merit, entrusting to others while achieving results—this is non-action yet nothing remains undone.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lǐ** says: *\"Without stepping outside, one knows all under Heaven\"*—this is inner knowledge. *\"The farther one goes\"*—this is external affairs. Hence, it follows as a lesson in study. *\"The more one studies, the more one gains\"*—this refers to scholars seeking increase. *\"The more one follows the Dao, the more one diminishes\"*—this refers to those who follow the Way diminishing in all things. The *Yijing* says: *\"Mountain over water: Diminishing. The superior person restrains anger and blocks desire\"*—this is precisely it. Until there is no anger to restrain and no desire to block, until one reaches non-action, then all under Heaven will be transformed, and the world will turn toward it.\n\n○ **Master Lǚ** says: The perfected one diminishes again and again, until distinctions vanish, still and unmoving, reaching non-action. They preserve the true nature of their essence and embody the origin of the Way. They harmonize with Heaven and Earth in virtue and share in creation’s function. Then they refine the Great Primordial *qi*, extract the golden essence from the elbow’s end, seal the womb and breathe inward, reverse the winds and blend them, irrigate the primal spring—all this is non-action yet nothing remains undone.\n\n○ **Master Ní** says: *\"The more one studies, the more one gains\"*—this values breadth. *\"The more one follows the Dao, the more one diminishes\"*—this values simplicity. First, one broadens before narrowing; first, one gains before diminishing. Without gain, where would one find simplicity? To gain without diminishing turns breadth into confusion. Thus, study is the ladder to the Dao, and the Dao is the destination of study. Confucius said: *\"Much learning and knowing—this is the gain of study. To thread it all with one principle—this is the diminishing of the Dao.\"* Having diminished, one diminishes again—this is the utmost diminishing. When diminishing reaches its end, there is nothing left to do. Though there is nothing to do, in truth, nothing remains undone. This is why non-action is precious. If one stops at mere non-action, unable to do nothing yet achieve everything, then one falls into emptiness—this is not the Dao.\n\n*\"To take all under Heaven, one must do nothing.\nBut when action arises, it is insufficient to take all under Heaven.\"*",

Hence the conclusion: *\"Knowing sufficiency, one is always sufficient.\"* For the contented poor find joy in poverty.\n\n**Chapter 47.**\n*\"Without stepping outside, one knows all under Heaven.\"*",

The sages of old who took all under Heaven did so through the natural Way. The yellow-roofed halls of Yao were not of his making; Shun and Yu held dominion without claiming it—all acted in accordance with their non-doing. If one acts upon the world, then one has attachment. The Classic says: 'To act is to ruin it; the world is a divine vessel that cannot be acted upon.' To act without acting, and the world is governed—this is it. This is why ancient sages did not exchange the Way for all under Heaven, yet always spoke warnings against taking the world, deeply cautioning those who did not know that they would prize the world above the Way. How could they know that non-action and non-doing are the natural Way?\"*\n\nLin Shi said: *\"To take all under Heaven, one must act without attachment. Those with attachment lose it. The Three Dynasties’ possession of the world—what room did they have for attachment? Though they spoke of wartime customs as metaphor, their words suffice as warning. Non-doing and doing are but non-attachment and attachment.\"*\n\nWu Shi said: *\"Non-doing is to have nothing to attend to—this is non-action. Those who speak of taking the world mean only non-action. When virtue is abundant, the world naturally returns to it. If one must exert will and force, engaging in deliberate action, how could one ever take the world?\"*\n\nLi Shi said: *\"If one rashly acts, the people grow disordered and difficult to govern. Hence, it is said one cannot take the world with such action.\"*\n\n**Chapter 49**\nThe sage has no fixed heart, taking the hearts of the people as his own.\n\nLü Shi said: *\"Heaven originally has no attachment to things; through things, Heaven’s heart is revealed.

Initially, there is no other heart—what fixed heart could there be?\"*\n\nGong Qing said: *\"There is but one Way in the world, one heart in the sage. Hence, he likens it to himself. Silent and tranquil, he responds yet remains settled, neither leading nor following, blending his light with dust, harmonizing with all things—yet never differing from them. Thus it is said: the sage has no fixed heart, taking the hearts of the people as his own.\"*\n\nLi Shi said: *\"The previous chapter spoke of taking the world through non-doing, hence follows with the sage’s lack of fixed heart. By 'no fixed heart,' it means adapting to circumstances without opposing the nature of people and things. Thus, the people follow the sage’s words, actions, and transformations, and the world unites in one heart.\"*\n\nHe Shi said: *\"The sage’s heart is too vast—what fixedness could it have?

What fixedness could there be? To the virtuous, I am virtuous; to the unvirtuous, I am also virtuous—virtue is virtue. To the trustworthy, I trust them; to the untrustworthy, I also trust them—virtue is trust.\"*\n\nLü Shi said: *\"Good and evil contradict each other; truth and deceit mock each other. Good and evil, truth and deceit—these are the common distinctions of the world. Thus, those who love virtue, the sage does not defy their nature but aids them with supreme virtue, ensuring they fulfill their goodness. If there are those who are unvirtuous, he also treats them with virtue. Their virtue or lack thereof lies with them, yet my way of treating them with virtue never wavers. All conduct is without exception virtuous, and the world cannot but submit to its transformation—how profound the virtue is! Those who sincerely love trust, the sage does not quench their resolve but aids them with great trust, ensuring they fulfill their sincerity. If there are those with insincerity, he also treats them with trust, yet my way of trusting them never changes. All emotions are without exception trustworthy, and the people firmly and surely trust—virtue reaches its peak. The perfect person transcends praise and blame, forgetting truth and falsehood. The beautiful he treats as virtuous; the ugly, he also treats as virtuous—constantly saving things without abandoning any. The trustworthy he trusts; the untrustworthy, he also trusts—constantly saving people without abandoning any.\"*\n\nHe Shi said: *\"Generally, to the virtuous I am virtuous; to the unvirtuous, I do not necessarily treat them as virtuous. To the trustworthy I trust them; to the untrustworthy, I do not necessarily trust them—this is the common heart, not yet the affair of virtue as virtue, trust as trust. The sage’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth: Heaven and Earth cover all without partiality, the sun and moon shine their light without fail. The sage’s heart is unified, merging self and other. Thus, he treats the unvirtuous as virtuous, the untrustworthy as trustworthy. Though good and evil contradict, truth and deceit mock, I treat them all with the natural Way. The Classic says: 'Refine the well-ordered, also refine the unordered; advance the good, to lead the ungood—what is good, what is ungood?' The saying goes: 'Do not counterfeit, do not presume upon the untrustworthy—what is trust, what is deceit?' 'Sincerity shines clearly; observe below and transform.' This is it.

Trust or lack thereof lies with them, yet I always treat them with trust, holding no doubting heart. The Master said: 'Do not presume upon the untrustworthy'—this is the same meaning.

      "translated_text": "「The term *徒* refers to one’s kind or category. *动之死地* is not the *动* of motion and stillness, but rather the *动* of action and cessation. *之* means \"to go,\" and *死地* means \"the place of death.\" *夫何故* is an interrogative phrase asking, \"Why is this so?\"\n\n*生者* is what sustains my life;\n*生生者* is what nourishes my life’s vitality.\nIf one nourishes life excessively—\nthis is why, upon taking action, one hastens toward the place of death.\nThis embodies the meaning:\nthe external body may persist while the self is gone,\nhaving nothingness before one can attain fullness,\nemptiness before one can achieve completeness.\n\n○ **Master He said:** \"The followers of death and life each number thirteen. Various schools have differing views, but they merely stretch the numbers to fit their own interpretations. In truth, the upper limit of longevity is a hundred years, while the middle and lower limits vary, and contentment with wealth, ease, and peace are all blessings—these are the followers of life. Short-lived, untimely demise, illness, poverty, and frailty are extremes—these are the followers of death. Yet even before discussing virtue and vice, the first two categories each receive their fate from Heaven. Who can equalize them? This is not yet the crux of the matter. But if one is foolish and unworthy, clinging to life while losing reason, creating unnatural agitation to hasten one’s own demise, they not only become a follower of death but also rush toward the place of death—this calamity lies within humanity itself.\n\n*The place of death* refers to those who act in accordance with vice yet do not embrace virtue. In generalizing about the world as described earlier, three out of every ten individuals fall into these categories, not necessarily adhering to the previous figures. Yet the followers of death already number thirteen, and those who hasten toward the place of death number another thirteen—six out of ten are doomed to death. The followers of life number only three—how dire!\n\nIf one seeks to preserve life and avoid death,\nonly one in ten is a virtuous person.\n\n*The Zhuangzi* states:\n*\"A man’s life is the gathering of his qi;\nwhen gathered, it is life; when scattered, it is death.\nIf death and life are merely categories,\nwhat need have I to fear them?\"*\nThus, it is clear that the true affliction lies in the *place of death*, not in being a follower of death.\n\n○ **Master Wu said:** *之* is akin to \"to go\" or \"to hasten.\" *生生* seeks to sustain life itself, while *厚* means excessive fixation—whether through Daoist elixir practices that stray from proper alignment or through alchemical preparations that overdo the measures. Their intent is to hasten life, yet in doing so, they only hasten toward the place of death, for their obsession with life does not conform to the natural Dao.\n\nIndeed, those who excel in preserving life\nwalk on land without encountering rhinoceros or tigers,\nenter battlefields without being struck by weapons or armor.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to lodge its horn,\nthe tiger no place to set its claws,\nand weapons no place to find their mark.\nWhy is this so?\nIt is because they have no place of death—\ntheir hearts are empty, and thus harm cannot touch them.\n\n○ **Master Lin said:** \"It is said that the ancient masters of life-nourishment, though wandering in deep mountains, never encountered rhinoceros or tigers; though entering the midst of armies, they were never struck by weapons or armor. This is because they had no fixation—thus, things could not harm them. The rhinoceros could not charge, the tiger could not attack, and weapons could not wound—all because they had no fixation. *The Zhuangzi* also speaks of entering water without drowning, entering fire without burning—this is the same principle.\n\nWhy is this so?\nAgain, a question arises:\nthings cannot harm them because they embody emptiness and nothingness,\nand thus have no place of death.\n\n○ **Master Wu said:** *摄* means \"to govern\" or \"to oversee,\" as in *摄政*—to temporarily manage life as though it were a realm to be governed, without claiming it as one’s own. Dwelling in the realm of emptiness and stillness, presenting as gentle and weak, they are solid and unknowing like wood or stone, yet innocent and desireless like a babe. Even when confronted by fierce beasts or wicked men, they are untouched by harm.\n\nFor their impurities are dissolved,\ntheir spirit and *qi* serene and tranquil—\nlike wind, like shadow—\nnothing can grasp or seize them.\nThere is no substance in them that can die,\nand even if harm comes their way,\nhow could it find purchase to wound them?\n\n○ **Master Li said:** \"Those without the place of death\nare those who forget life and death.\"\n\n○ **Master He said:** \"Rhinoceros and tigers are spoken of as the most formidable of beasts—rhinoceros, the wild ox, weighing a thousand *jin*, with a single horn.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One:**\n*The Dao* gives birth to life;\n*virtue/power* nourishes it;\nthings take their form from it;\ncircumstances bring it to fruition.\"",
      "overlap_context": "larity;\nto indulge in desire is to stir the waves of suffering.\nWhen water and fire conflict, death follows—\nthus it is said: the followers of death.\n\nMan’s life depends on water and fire;\nto step into the realm of death is to let them conflict.\nIn the Dao of the Elixir,\nwhen water and fire are harmonized,\nthe Holy Embryo congeals.\"*\n\nLin Shi said: *\"If cultivation follows the Way,\none may achieve longevity and clear vision.\nIf cultivation does not follow the Way,\none perishes with all things.\"*",

the mouth,\nthen the Five *Qi*’s within solidify,\nand the Original Essence does not dry.\nConstantly dimming the eyes,\nthen the inner realm does not emerge,\nand the outer realm does not intrude—\nin stillness, supreme equanimity,\nunited with the Dao.\n\nThe *Shēntóng Qìè* (Parametric Agreement) says:\nEars and eyes are one’s treasures,\nkeep them sealed, do not let them shine.\nDo not speak with the *Yuè* (兑) mouth,\nnor seek the subtle with the coarse.\nThis is what is meant by:\n**塞其兑, 闭其门**—\nthus the body labors not its whole life.\n\nShould one open the gates of delight\nyet fail to **塞** (*sè*) them,\nadvance the affairs of desire\nyet fail to **闭** (*bì*) them,\nthen external things shall entice,\nand inner passions shall stir—\n*Qi* shall dissipate, fluids shall leak,\nand the spirit shall scatter.\nIts spirit shall wither and die,\nand none shall be able to save it—\nthus it is said:\n**开其兑, 济其事**—\nthroughout life, the body cannot be saved.\n\n○ Lin Shi says:\n*Yuè* (兑) is the mouth,\nin the body there is a mouth,\nin the home there is a gate—\nall are metaphors for the place\nfrom which all things emerge.\n\n**塞其兑, 闭其门**—\nto conceal *Yǒu* within *Wu* and not reveal it.\n*\"Thus the body labors not\"*—\nmeaning success without toil.\nTo open **兑** (*yuè*)—\nto emerge and put it to use.\nTo advance its affairs—\nto use it and seek further benefit.\n*\"Thus peril and ruin shall be unavoidable.\"*\n\n○ He Shi says:\nThe gate—\nthough ancient commentaries point to the mouth,\nthis is not rigid—\nanything that has emergence and intrusion\nmay be called a gate.\nTo **闭其门** (*bì qí mén*)—\nto obscure the mind with the Great Dao,\nso that external thoughts do not enter,\nand inner thoughts do not escape.\nAs in *Zhuāngzǐ* (Chuang Tzu):\n*\"If one’s heart rejects it,\nthen Heaven’s gate shall not open.\"*\n\nIndeed, **塞兑闭门**—\nto enter *Wu* and extinguish *Yǒu*,\nfor the Child to know the Mother,\nis to return to the beginning,\nand thus throughout life,\nits application shall require no labor.\n\nShould one open **兑** (*yuè*) and advance its affairs,\nthen with every thought and movement,\none shall stray from the original,\nand ruin *Wu* while losing *Yǒu*—\nas the Mother gives birth to the Child,\nand entrusts it in myriad forms,\nthe Child grows strong while the Mother weakens,\nthe wheel turning endlessly—\nthroughout life, salvation shall be difficult.\n\n○ Li Shi says:\n**塞兑闭门**—\nthe inner realm does not emerge,\nthe outer realm does not intrude—\nthus the body labors not,\nand is governed without effort.\nTo open **兑** (*yuè*)—\nthe inner realm emerges,\nthe outer realm intrudes—\nthus the body cannot be saved,\nand the True Dao is forever lost.\n\n*\"Perceiving the small is clarity,\"*\n*\"Guarding the soft is strength.\"*\nUsing its light,\nthen returning to its clarity—\nno harm shall come to the body.\n\nThis is called **袭常** (*xí cháng*).\n\n○ Lin Shi says:\nWhat one perceives is vast,\nyet if one can gather and make it small,\nthen it is supreme clarity.\nWhat one governs is rigid,\nyet if one can retreat and guard the soft,\nthen it is supreme strength.\nThus, not self-asserting is clarity,\nnot self-aggrandizing is longevity.\n\nLight is the application of clarity,\nclarity is the essence of light—\nto use its light and return it to clarity,\nthen there shall be no blame.\nTo know its application yet not know concealment,\nis the way of inviting harm.\n**袭** (*xí*) means concealment,\n**常** (*cháng*) means unchanging—\n**袭常** (*xí cháng*) means\nto conceal its application and not exhaust it.\n\n○ He Shi says:\nAll who can be great yet cannot be small,\nstrong yet cannot be weak,\nclear yet cannot be obscure,\nthen they abandon the root for the branches—\nthe Child generates another Child,\nendlessly drifting, forgetting to return—\nwhat then of the Mother?\nThis is the way of inviting harm.\n\nThe Beginning is the Dao of constant *Wu*,\nthe Mother is the Dao of constant *Yǒu*—\nfrom *Wu* arises *Yǒu*,\nfrom *Yǒu* returns to *Wu*—\nthis is the unchanging Great Dao.\n\nIt is also said:\n*\"Using light yet returning to clarity—*\nthe sage shines without dazzling.\"\n*\"Observing deep fish is an ill omen.\"*\n\n○ Lü Shi says:\nThe reflection of water\nilluminating things is called light,\nits essence is called clarity—\nto use its light

cleverness.\n*\"Scrutinizing and exacting\"* means excessive fussing.\n*\"Pure and unspoiled\"* means self-contentment.\n*\"Deficient\"* means insufficiency.\nThis also conveys the idea:\nwhere there

one day’s making.\n\nMaster Li said:\nThe previous chapter spoke of non-action and non-interference,\nletting the people transform themselves—\na governance of broad tolerance.\nThus it follows with *\"governance is obscure and unadorned,\"*\nmeaning:\nwhen the ruler is tolerant and expansive, the people are sincere and genuine;\nwhen the ruler is overly active, the people grow dull and violent.\n*\"Obscure and unadorned\"* is tolerance,\n*\"scrutinizing and exacting\"* is meticulousness—\ntolerance wins the people,\nrigid law without flexibility harms them.\nMisfortune and fortune

fishing net—\nyet they still deemed it insufficient.\nThe people’s loss of their nature\nwas never more severe.\nThus they constantly stumbled into prohibitions,\ntheir refinement and decay scattering,\nand customs daily declined.\n\nThose of shallow learning or just beginning the True Way,\nnot yet attaining Dao’s subtlety,\ntheir *qi* and spirit not yet condensed,\ntheir minds entangled in affairs,\nobsessed with minute scrutiny,\npraising cleverness and deceit—\nif they govern themselves thus,\nthey gasp and strain,\ntheir true essence departs,\nand this is not the Way of nurturing life.\nThus it is said:\n*\"When governance is scrutinizing and exacting,\nits people grow deficient.\"*\n\nMoreover, the origins of chaos and order,\nthe sources of misfortune and fortune—\nthese have existed since antiquity,\narising from human actions.\nWhen misfortune hides within fortune,\nif fortune reaches its peak\nand one cannot practice humility and fear,\nbut instead indulges in arrogance and excess,\nthere has never been one who did not invite misfortune.\n\nWhen fortune lies hidden within misfortune,\nif one, amid calamity and hardship,\nsuddenly abandons past

      "translated_text": "○ **Master Wu says:**\n\"Governing\" is the same as \"descending.\"\n\"Ghosts\" refer to the **qi of Heaven and Earth**—**divine and numinous** forces, **portents and omens**.\n\nHumankind’s **qi** flows as one with the **qi of Heaven and Earth**.\nThe sovereign who follows the **Dao** descends upon the world with **serenity and simplicity**,\ndoes not disturb or harm the people,\nso the people’s **qi** becomes **purified and harmonized**,\nfilling the **Heavenly and Earthly realms**,\nmutually resonating in **correspondence and response**,\nand the **qi of Heaven and Earth** does not dare to act in **contrariety or perversity**,\nso its **ghostly portents** do not become **malevolent omens** to bring calamity.\n\n○ **Master He says:**\nTo govern the world with the **Dao** is to **divinely illuminate** the people and bring them **serenity**.\nAs *Zhuangzi* says, the sage descends upon the world only when compelled,\nand nothing surpasses **non-action**.\n**Non-action** means the people find **tranquility in their natural lives**,\nacting without interference, yet ever **spontaneously**,\nand nothing can harm them.\n\n○ **Riverbank Master** [河上公] says:\nWhen one holds office by **Dao and virtue** and governs the world,\nthe **ghosts** dare not display their **spiritual essence** to offend humanity.\nIt is not that their **spiritual essence** is absent—\nrather, they cannot harm those who live in **natural harmony**.\nNor is it that they are unable to harm—\nthe sage also does not harm them.\n**Master Lü says:**\nIt is not that the **ghosts** lack **divine transformations** and **mysterious sounds**,\nbut rather that the sage maintains his **proper station**,\nand the **ghosts** ought to **reverently praise** the **grand beauty of Heaven and Earth**,\n**assisting and harmonizing** with **illuminated virtue**,\nfittingly bestowing blessings,\nand not merely refraining from **malevolent omens** and **mysterious transformations**\nto harm the people.\n\nMoreover, the **Daoist sage** does not allow the **ghosts** to display their **divine transformations**,\nfor they cannot harm those who abide in **natural harmony**.\nThus it is said: *\"It is not that the ghosts lack spiritual essence—\nrather, they cannot harm those who live in natural harmony.\"*\nWhen the **spiritual essence** is **settled in rectitude**,\nit does not harm the people,\nfor it submits to the **illuminated virtue** of the sage,\nretiring into **hidden realms** and not daring to reveal its **portents and omens**.\n\nThe sage pities even a single individual who has lost his **proper place**,\nnever failing to consider the means to **rescue and sustain** him.\nJust as a father nurtures his child,\nthough he wraps and swaddles him,\nhis care is ever **vigilant and tender**—\nhow could he harm him?\nThis is like the **Daoist sage** abiding in **natural harmony**,\nwhere not only the **ghosts** dare not offend,\nbut the sage himself does not harm them either.\nThe sage, who **honors the Dao** and **values virtue**,\nwould never harm those who follow the **Dao**!\n\nThus it is said: *\"It is not that the spiritual essence cannot harm—\nrather, the sage does not harm them.\"*\n\n○ **Master Wu says:**\nThe reason the **ghosts** do not become **portents and omens** is not that they are incapable—\nthough they can become **portents and omens**, they do not act in **malevolence** to harm humanity.\nAgain, the **ghosts'** portents and omens** do not harm humanity not because they are inherently so,\nbut because the sage can **purify and harmonize** the people’s **qi** without harming the **qi of Heaven and Earth**,\nso the **qi of Heaven and Earth** also remains **purified and harmonized** and does not harm humanity.\nThe terms **\"ghosts\"** and **\"spiritual essence\"** both refer to the **qi of Heaven and Earth**,\ntwo names yet one reality.\n\n○ **Riverbank Master** [河上公] says:\nThe **ghosts** are not without **spiritual essence**—\nthey simply cannot harm those who live in **natural harmony**.\nWhen both sides do not harm each other,\n**virtue and power** mutually return to their source.\n\n○ **Master Lü says:**\nHumans are governed by the **yang**, the **ghosts** by the **yin**.\nHumans **preserve their natural lives**,\nwhile the **ghosts** **fulfill their divine spirits**.\nBoth sides, in **reciprocal delight**, do not harm one another,\nleading to **Heaven’s clarity and Earth’s peace**,\n**harmony between yin and yang**,\n**abundant harvests each year**,\n**no creatures maimed or lost**,\n**no flaws in the state**,\n**no plagues among the people**,\n**no malevolent omens from the ghosts**—\nthus **virtue and power** mutually return to their source.\n\n○ **Master Lin** [林氏] says:\n**Hidden realms** manifest as **yin and yang**,\nwhile **illuminated governance** is the **sage’s proper station**.\nThese two aspects inherently do not harm each other,\nso their **virtue and power** mutually return.\nThis means **Heaven and Earth** follow their **natural Dao**,\nand the sage also follows the **natural Dao**,\neach preserving their own **virtue and power** without encroachment,\nhence the saying: *\"They mutually return.\"*\n\n**Not harming** means **not encroaching**.\nThis passage first presents a general statement,\nthen elaborates on the **Way of the Three Powers**—\nall of it is about **non-action**.\nTo govern the world with the **Dao** is to encompass the **Three Powers** [Heaven, Earth, humanity].\nAll things beneath the **Great Void** [太虚]\nare governed by the **Dao**:\n**Heaven** fulfills its role of **covering and nurturing**,\n**Earth** fulfills its role of **bearing and sustaining**,\nand the sage fulfills his role of **teaching and guiding**.\nWhen each fulfills its own role without encroaching,\nall attain their **Dao**.\n\n○ **Riverbank Master** [河上公] says:\nThe **ghosts** and the **sage** both do not harm each other.\nWhen neither harms the other,\nhumans are governed by the **yang**,\nwhile the **ghosts** are governed by the **yin**,\nhumans **preserve their natural lives**,\nand the **ghosts** **fulfill their divine spirits**—\nthus **virtue and power** mutually return.\n\n○ **Master He** [何氏] says:\nThe ancient people dwelled in the **indistinct void** [混茫],\nand with the world they **dissolved in tranquility**.\nAt that time,\n**yin and yang** knew **stillness**,\n**ghosts and gods** did not disturb,\nthe **Four Seasons** followed their **proper rhythms**,\nand all things were **unharmed**.\nThough creatures had **awareness**,\nthey **did not apply it**—\nthis was called **\"Absolute Unity\"**,\nwhere **non-action** and **spontaneity** prevail eternally.\nThis is the case.\n\n**Chapter 61:**\n*\"Great states are the lower streams [of the world],\nthe **confluence of all things**,\nthe **yin of the world**.*\n*The **yin** always overcomes the **yang** by **stillness**,\nand **stillness** is the **yin**’s way.*\n\n○ **Master Lin** [林氏] says:\nBorrowing the **principle of great states and small states**,\nhe illustrates that the **Daoist sage** ought to **be humble and still**,\nnot teaching people to **submit themselves** to gain victory.\nSince the **Three Dynasties** onward,\nthere have been those who **seize states**,\nso he uses their observations as an analogy.\n\n*\"Lower streams\"* means to **place oneself in a humble station**.\nThe people of great states,\nif they **humble themselves**,\ncan **unite the world’s confluence**,\njust as the **yin** overcomes the **yang** by **stillness**.\nTo **humble oneself** is to **abide in stillness** as the **Dao**,\nhence the saying: *\"Stillness is the yin’s way.\"*\n\n○ **Master Lü** [吕氏] says:\nThe reason the **seas and rivers** can be the **\"sovereigns of all valleys\"** [百谷]\nis that they **excel in humility**.\nAll streams **converge at the river’s source** [朝宗],\njust as great states, through **humility and inclusivity**,\ncan **unite all people** without exception.\nThe **Classics** say:\n*\"When Heaven and Earth’s **qi** converge, all things are born.\nWhen the **Dao of humanity** converges, **achievements and merit** are fulfilled.\"*\nThis is what is meant by *\"confluence.\"*",

things,\nPolishes the formless,\nSilent and unmoving—\nThe **Great Dao** is **mysterious and obscure**,\nDeep, vast, and boundless,\nUnattainable from without,\nUnfathomable within—\nThis is what is called the **mysterious core of all things**.\nLike the **inner sanctum of a hall**,\nNot glimpsed in haste,\nAs *Zhuangzi* says, the **Dao** is the **shared source of all things**,\nHence this chapter first speaks of **treasure**, then of **nobility**.\n\nThe **Dao** does not distance itself from people—\nPeople distance themselves from the **Dao**.\nThough there is a distinction between **virtuous** and **unvirtuous**,\nEven the **unvirtuous** rely upon it in hidden ways for **security**.\n\n**Master Wu** says:\nThe **mysterious core of all things** refers to what is **most honored**—\n*\"Olymp\"* (奥) is the **west-south corner of a hall**, where the **noble** reside,\nThus *\"Olymp\"* signifies **nobility**.\nThe **nobility of the Dao** is like this.\n**Treasure** is what the **virtuous** value—\nWhen the **virtuous** turn toward the **Dao** and cultivate it,\nThey gain **esteem from others**,\nHence it is said: *\"The treasure of the virtuous.\"*\nWhen the **unvirtuous** turn toward the **Dao** and repent,\nThey may yet **preserve themselves**,\nHence it is said: *\"The safeguard of the unvirtuous.\"*\n**Graceful speech** can be **traded in the market**,\n**Noble conduct** can **elevate others**.\nWhy should the **unvirtuous** be **cast aside**?\nThus, when establishing the **Son of Heaven** and appointing the **Three Ministers**,\nEven with **jewel-encircled jade and four-horse chariots** offered first,\nIt is **not as valuable** as **sitting and advancing this Dao**.\n\n**Master Li** says:\n**Graceful speech** can be **traded in the market**—\nSufficient to **please the multitude**,\n**Noble conduct** can **elevate others**—\nSufficient to **rise above the crowd**.\nIf a person is **unvirtuous**, why **abandon them**?\nTo establish the **Son of Heaven** and appoint the **Three Ministers** is to **make them rulers and teachers**,\nTo **cultivate the people below**,\nSo that the **unvirtuous** follow their **transformations**.\n**Jewel-encircled jade and four-horse chariots** are **not truly noble**—\nNot as noble as **sitting and advancing this Dao**,\nCultivating oneself to **settle the people**,\nLeading with **respect and humility** so they **do not contend**,\nDisplaying **virtue and righteousness** so they **upright their conduct**,\nDemonstrating **approval and disapproval** so they **know prohibitions**—\nThus the **Sage** always **rescues people with virtue**,\nAnd **never abandons anyone**.\n\n**Master Chai** says:\nThe **Dao’s flavor** is **beneficial**—\nLike **treasure brought to market**,\nHence *\"graceful speech can be traded in the market.\"*\n**Virtue’s weight** is **irresistible**,\nHence *\"noble conduct can elevate others.\"*\nIf a person is **unvirtuous**, why **abandon them**?\nTeach them to **transform**—\nHow dare one **abandon them**?\nThus, establishing the **Son of Heaven** and appointing the **Three Ministers** is to **assist in advancing this Dao**.\n\n**Master Wu** says:\nThe **virtuous** gain **esteem from others** through the **Dao**—\nTheir **praiseworthy words** are **lovable**, like **fine goods sold in the market**,\nTheir **exalted deeds** are **worthy of veneration**, rising above others.\nThe **unvirtuous** preserve themselves through the **Dao**—\nFearful of **punishment**, few in **guilt**, their **bodies remain whole and secure**,\nThus even the **unvirtuous**—\nHow could the **Dao** ever **abandon them**?\n**Jewel-encircled jade**—a **jewel held in both hands**—\n**Four-horse chariots**—a **single team of horses**,\n**Jewel-encircled jade and four-horse chariots** are **the height of nobility**,\nYet they are **not truly noble**.\nNot as noble as **advancing this Dao**—\n**Jewel-encircled jade and four-horse chariots** are **not as noble as this Dao**,\nHence all things **hold it in highest esteem** as their **mysterious core**.\n\n**Master He** says:\nNot to **glory in jade, gems, or chariots**,\nBut to **hold advancing this Dao as noble**.\nWhy did the **ancients** hold this **Dao** in such **nobility**?\nWas it not because **seeking it brings attainment**,\nAnd **guilt is pardoned**?\nThus it is **noble for all under Heaven**.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nMoreover, why did the **ancients** hold this **Dao** in such **nobility**?\nBecause **seeking it brings attainment**—\nThe **Dao** is **within oneself**,\nTo **practice virtue** depends on **oneself**, not others.\nTo **pardon guilt**—\nA single **virtuous thought** can **correct errors**,\nEven the **wicked**, through **fasting, purification, and bathing**, may **offer sacrifice to the Most High**.\nIt is not said, *\"As the *Poetry Classic* does not say?\"*\nThe **Dao** knows **no distinction between wise and foolish**—\n**Awakening brings attainment**,\nThis is why it is **truly noble**,\nHence it is said: *\"Thus it is noble for all under Heaven.\"*\n\n**Master He** says:\nWithout a single person **not gaining what they desire** or **gathering what they seek**,\nAll their **pursuits are fulfilled**.\nThe **Noble One** delights in **attaining the Dao** and **rests in virtue**,\nThe **petty person** delights in **attaining desires** but **shames unvirtue**,\nEven those who are **unvirtuous** yet **turn their hearts toward the Dao**,\n**Shift toward virtue and distance guilt**—\nUnaware, they do so.\nThis is how those **who embody the Dao** gain **great use in the world**,\nAnd it also **reveals the Dao’s efficacy**—\nThe more **noble**, the more **esteemed**,\nThus it is said: *\"The ancients held this Dao in nobility\"*—\nNot of **this present age alone**, but **throughout antiquity**.\nThus it is.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three**\n**Act without acting**,\n**Manage without managing**,\n**Savor without savoring**.\n\n**Master Lü** says:\nThe **Sage acts without purpose**,\nYet **trusts in things’ natural self-so**,\nThus **without acting, nothing remains undone**—\nHow could the **heart** ever **cease moving**?\n**Manages without interference**,\nYet **follows things’ natural affairs**,\nThus **without managing, nothing remains unattended**—\nHow could the **body** ever **cease laboring**?\n**Savors without indulgence**,\nYet **follows things’ inherent flavors**,\nThus **without savoring, nothing remains unsavored**—\nHow could the **mouth** ever **cease craving**?\nWhen the **heart is unmoved**, all **wonders are visible**,\nWhen the **body is unlabored**, **spirit is undiminished**,\nWhen the **mouth is unindulgent**, **essence is undrained**—\nThe **Perfect One** **acts in cultivation and nourishment**,\nYet **does not engage in reckless deeds**,\n**Attends to True Refining**,\nYet **does not involve themselves in worldly affairs**,\n**Savors in virtue and morality**,\nYet **does not indulge in carrion and rank odors**,\nHence it is said:\n**Act without acting**,\n**Manage without managing**,\n**Savor without savoring**.\n\n**Master Lin** says:\nOnly when **acting without acting** can one **do all things**,\nHence *\"Act without acting.\"*\nOnly when **managing without managing** can one **gather all affairs**,\nHence *\"Manage without managing.\"*\nOnly when **indulging without indulging** can one **truly know flavor**,\nHence *\"Savor without savoring.\"*\n\n**Master Li** says:\n**Act without acting**—\nThis **unfolds the mysterious core of all things** from the previous chapter.\n**Act without acting**—\n**Nothing remains undone**,\n**Manage without managing**—\n**All affairs succeed**,\n**Savor without savoring**—\nIts **flavor is profound and enduring**—\nThese three are the **Dao’s mysterious core**.",

**virtue**—\nIf no one harbors deep malice,\nWhat cause for resentment remains?\n\nThe **Perfect Person’s** **Way** is vast,\nHis **primordial simplicity** minute,\nThough his actions are many,\nTheir essence is few.\nGreat and small contain the **Great Void** within a square inch,\nMuch and little encompass all things in **One Reality**,\nIn harmony with all things, all things become one with

gratitude and **virtue**,\nAll arise from subtle beginnings,\nStart in ease, and end in difficulty,\nBegin in the fine, and culminate in the grand.\nIf one plans at the time of initial ease,\nThen at the end, there will be no difficulty.\nIf one acts at the time of first simplicity,\nThen afterward, it will surely be grand.\n\nThus, the world’s difficult tasks\nMust begin in what is easy,\nDesiring to act in ease\nTo plan for the weighty and great.\nThe world’s grandest deeds\nMust arise from the minute,\nDesiring to act in the minute\nTo remove it.\n\nOne’s own difficult task is **cultivating the True**,\nOne’s own grand task is **walking the **Way**.\nNothing is more difficult than **cultivating the True**,\nYet if one approaches it as if it were easy,\nOne’s resolve will be firm and unshaken—\nWhat difficulty remains?\nNothing is greater than **walking the **Way**,\nYet if one treats it as a minor matter,\nAnd persists without ceasing,\nAccumulating the fine to reach the grand—\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nThose who can be great must also be able to be small,\nThose who can be much must also be able to be little,\nThose who harbor resentment must repay with **virtue**,\nThose who plan for difficulty must first embrace ease,\nThose who achieve the great must first attend to the minute.\nFrom *\"Savor without savoring\"* onward,\nAll are metaphors.\nDifficult tasks must begin in ease,\nGreat deeds must arise from the minute—\nThis is merely elaborating the **Dao’s** intent.\n\n**Master Liu says:**\nSome say to Confucius:\n*\"You advocate repaying resentment with directness,\nYet now you say to repay it with **virtue**—why?\"*\nIndeed, **Laozi** teaches people\nTo dwell in gentleness and weakness,\nTo align with Heaven’s course,\nAnd to avoid contention—\nThus averting Heaven’s punishments\nAnd warding off human calamities.\nIf one repays resentment with directness,\nHow could resentment ever cease?\nAt that time, Confucius spoke in provocation,\nYet nothing surpasses repaying with **virtue** as good.\n\nThus the **Sage** never seeks to be great,\nAnd so can achieve the great.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nThe **Sage** does not act in what is difficult or grand,\nYet does nothing and attends to nothing,\nSimple and easy, simple and knowable—\nThus can he establish foundations that endure and grow grand.\nThe **Sage** cherishes **virtue** and **power**,\nKnows himself without revealing himself,\nLoves himself without esteeming himself,\nNever seeks to be great.\nWithin the square inch, in the realm of true nature,\nThere is nothing he does not forget,\nNothing he does not possess—\nSerene and boundless,\nYet all beauties follow him.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Therefore the **Sage** never seeks to be great,\nAnd so can achieve the great.\"*\n\n**Master Li says:**\nWhen the **Sage’s** deeds are fully realized,\nHe does not claim greatness himself—\nHeaven does not claim to be Heaven;\nWhat makes Heaven is things.\nThe **Sage** does not claim to be the **Sage**;\nWhat makes the **Sage** is the people.\nBecause he does not claim to be the **Sage**,\nHe can become the **Sage**.\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nThe **Sage** does not claim greatness yet remains humble and lowly—\nThus he achieves the great.\n\nHe who makes light promises will lack trust,\nHe who takes many things lightly will face many difficulties.\nThus the **Sage** still regards them as difficult,\nAnd so in the end faces no difficulty.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nHe who makes light promises lacks sincerity,\nAnd reckless responses will lead to deceit.\nHe who takes many things lightly is negligent in affairs,\nAnd reckless action will lead to difficulty.\nEven the **Sage’s** talents find difficulty in minute, easy matters,\nLet alone failing to dare act lightly in all things—\nThus, in the **Way**, he is diligent and perseveres,\nAnd in the end faces no difficulty.\n\nLight promises lead to few fulfillments,\nMany easy things lead to many difficulties—\nThus it is said that first embracing difficulty leads to attainment,\nFor difficulty and ease complement each other.\n\n**Master Li says:**\nDifficult tasks are easy to complete,\nEasy tasks are difficult to complete—\nEasy tasks must not be taken lightly,\nFor if they are, people will neglect them,\nThus the **Sage** still regards them as difficult.\nWhat is gained with difficulty is lost with difficulty—\nIf one does not act lightly in all things,\nThen in the end there will be no difficulty.\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nThose who make light promises often overcommit,\nAnd so must fail in trust.\nThose who treat matters with a careless heart\nOften fail to complete them—\nThis is also metaphorical language.\nBut by adding *\"the man who\"* [夫],\nThe meaning shifts again.\nEarlier, it was said *\"easy\"* [易],\nFor fear people would view it with a lighthearted attitude,\nThus turning it to say:\n*\"Easy\" is not \"light and easy\"—*\nThe **Sage** still treats it with a difficult mindset,\nAnd so reaches a state of no difficulty—\nLet alone others.\n\nThis intent means:\nWhen earlier it spoke of *\"easy,\"*\nIt referred to **non-action** and **non-affairs** being easy to practice,\nNot that *\"easy\"* means acting lightly.\n\n**Master He says:**\nEmpty promises bring real disaster—\nHe who makes light promises will lack trust indeed.\nWords spoken without reproach.\nMany easy things lead to many difficulties—\nThe **Sage**, dwelling in **non-action** and savoring **non-flavor**,\nPenetrating the **Way** beyond form,\nGives rise to **being** from **non-being**,\nAnd difficulty and ease complement each other.\nAdapting to things without being bound by them,\nYet able to flexibly complete all things without omission—\nThus it is said:\n*\"There is nothing he does not forget,\nNothing he does not possess.\"*\nThis reveals the **Sage’s** heart—\nNeither

plan against.\nIts fragility is easy to shatter,\nIts subtlety is easy to disperse.\n\nAct before things arise,\nSet things in order before they fall into disorder.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nThe ancient rulers of the world—\nWhen governing, they faced disorder as their counterpart,\nWhen securing peace, they faced peril as their counterpart.\nWhen the state was at peace, it was easy to maintain,\nBut when it leaned toward danger, it became difficult to defend.\nThus the *Book of Zhou* says:\n*\"Establish governance before disorder arises,\nPreserve the realm before danger manifests.\"*\nFor like a sprout not yet strong,\nIts fragility is easy to shatter,\nAnd remorse not yet settled,\nIts subtleties are easy to disperse.\n\nTake from oneself—\nIn the prime of youth, when the body is at ease,\nIt is easy to practice self-cultivation.\nThe rewards are seen swiftly,\nFor when sickness has not yet manifested,\nOne’s cultivation and refinement are easy to plan and achieve.\nBut when desires grow excessive,\nSpirit weakens and vital essence is depleted,\nOnce illness strikes, it flees like passing waves.\nIf nurturing is done properly,\nQi harmonious and spirit undisturbed,\nEven minor ailments are easy to treat.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Its ease is easy to maintain,\nIts unseen signs are easy to plan against,\nIts fragility is easy to shatter,\nIts subtlety is easy to disperse.\"*\nMoreover, the person yet to fall ill\nIs easy to heal,\nThe state yet to face danger\nIs easy to strategize for.\nIf one prepares defenses beforehand,\nThen disasters not yet formed—\nHow could they take root?\nIf one makes plans in advance,\nThen troubles not yet visible—\nHow could they arise?\n\nTherefore, the **Sage** does not fear many difficulties,\nBut fears the absence of difficulty.\nFor calamity and fortune are inherently intertwined—\nIf one attends to their latent origins,\nCalamity may turn into fortune.\nBut if one neglects them once they manifest,\nFortune may shift into calamity—\nBeyond remedy.\n\nThus, the **Dao** of regulating the body and harmonizing the heart\nIs to preemptively guard against emotions and desires,\nTo balance and adapt the spirit and qi,\nAnd prevent them from falling into disorder.\n\n**Master Li says:**\nReferring to the meaning of the previous chapter,\n*\"Its ease is easy to maintain\"*—\nWhen undertaking deeds, the sincere seeker of **True Dao** (*Xiu Zhen Zhi Shi*)\nRectifies the heart before thoughts arise,\nAnd restrains emotions before they are provoked by external things.\nThen the heart is easily corrected,\nAnd emotions easily severed.\nBut if one governs affairs after they have fallen into disorder,\nAnd wards off disasters after they have already sprouted—\nIs that not difficult?\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nWhen peace prevails,\nMaintaining it is easy.\nBut once danger arises,\nIt becomes difficult to hold firm.\nWhen troubles are yet unseen,\nPlanning against them is clear and easy.\nBut once they take form,\nThey become hard to counter.\nFragile yet not yet strong—\nAttack it, and it is easy to shatter.\nBut once it grows firm,\nIt is hard to attack.\nThus, one must act before things arise,\nAnd govern before they fall into disorder.\n\nA tree thick enough to embrace,\nGrows from a tiny sprout.\nA nine-tiered tower,\nRises from a single basket of soil.\nA journey of a thousand miles,\nBegins with a single step.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nIf one does not preemptively guard against troubles,\nNor block evil at its roots,\nIt is like planting a tree.\nWhen it first sprouts,\nOne may uproot and sever it—\nHow easy!\nBut once it reaches a thickness of a hundred feet,\nHow can one cut it down?\n\nAgain, if one builds a tower,\nStarting with a single basket of soil,\nOne may kick it into place—\nHow difficult could that be?\nBut once it rises to nine tiers,\nTowering a hundred feet high,\nHow can one demolish it?\n\nAgain, if one embarks on a distant journey,\nBeginning with a single step,\nOne may turn back at once.\nBut once it stretches a thousand miles,\nEndless and vast,\nHow can one return?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"A tree thick enough to embrace,\nGrows from a tiny sprout.\nA nine-tiered tower,\nRises from a single basket of soil.\nA journey of a thousand miles,\nBegins with a single step.\"*\n\n**Master Li says:**\nSmall things accumulate into greatness—\nBeyond remedy.\nThus the *Yijing* warns:\n*\"Treading on frost, expect solid ice.\"*\nThe commentary states:\n*\"A subject slays his ruler,\nA son slays his father—\nThis is not the work of a single morning or evening.\nTheir origins lie in gradual corruption,\nFrom failing to discern early.\"* (*Yi Bian Zhi Bu Zao Ye*)\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nA tree thick enough to embrace,\nIts growth must begin from a sprout.\nA nine-tiered tower,\nIts construction must start from a single basket of soil.\nA journey of a thousand miles,\nMust begin with the first step.\nAll these examples\nSpeak to the **Dao**-seeker’s need to understand the critical moment (*ji*).\n\nHe who acts will fail,\nHe who grasps will lose.\nThus the **Sage** practices **non-action** and avoids failure,\nLets go and avoids loss.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nIf one acts out of differentiation,\nOne disrupts **nature’s** spontaneity.\nIf one clings to desires and gains,\nOne loses **spirit’s** essence.\nBetter to rest in what is at ease,\nAnd guard what is naturally held—\nThen one governs without knowing one governs,\nActs without seeing one acts.\n\nThe **Sage** perceives where things fail—\nFrom having acted.\nIf one does not act, how could there be failure?\nWhere intentions falter—\nFrom having grasped.\nIf one does not grasp, how could there be loss?\n\nIf one governs the body through action,\nThen form is strained and spirit taxed,\nMind and soul grow weary.\nIf one clings to things,\nThen one becomes fixated in one corner,\nNever departing from the myriad attachments,\nFar from the **Way**.\n\nThe **Sage** has never acted nor grasped—\nPure and unadulterated **True Dao** (*Zhen Zhen*).\nThus, enduring ten thousand kalpas without failure,\nNo form to grasp—\nHow could there be loss?\n\n**Master He says:**\nThe **Sage**, when undertaking deeds, attends to their beginnings,\nAnd ensures both good beginnings and endings.\nHe never dares to act lightly,\nNor cling to what he sees.\nFor he harbors the subtle and profound,\nEmbraces simplicity and purity,\nAnd does not dare stir up the contentious hearts of the world.\nHe follows **principle** (*li*) in his actions—\nWhat does he do?\nHe aligns with the times in his deeds—\nWhat does he grasp?\nNames follow their own destinies,\nAffairs unfold naturally—\nHow could he fail or lose?\n\nThe people, when they act,\nOften falter just as things are nearing completion.\nIf one is cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nThen there will be no failed affairs.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nThough the world strives for good deeds,\nNone lack a beginning,\nFew achieve an end.\nAll grow weary from the start,\nBegin with joy but end in weariness,\nNear completion yet then collapse—\nThis is because their resolve is not steadfast,\nAnd thus **True Dao** does not solidify.\nVital essence leaks away,\nHence it is said:\n*\"Qi depletion, essence leakage—\nThis is not one’s own form.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "sy things lead to many difficulties—\nThe **Sage**, dwelling in **non-action** and savoring **non-flavor**,\nPenetrating the **Way** beyond form,\nGives rise to **being** from **non-being**,\nAnd difficulty and ease complement each other.\nAdapting to things without being bound by them,\nYet able to flexibly complete all things without omission—\nThus it is said:\n*\"There is nothing he does not forget,\nNothing he does not possess.\"*\nThis reveals the **Sage’s** heart—\nNeither **being** nor **non-being**.",

ruin?\n\n**Master He says:**\nCommon folk who seek to act\nDeem diligence as incompetence,\nThose who cling to rigidity\nSee adaptability as unprincipled.\nThus their affairs fail when nearly complete—\nThis warns against failing to *palindromically* (*shènzhōng-rúshǐ*) persevere,\nLest one begin with vigor but end in few achievements.\n\nHence the Sage\nDesires without desiring,\nDoes not prize hard-to-obtain wealth,\nLearns without learning,\nCorrects the errors of the multitude,\nTo aid the natural unfolding of all things,\nYet dares not act.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nThe True Person is not without desire—\nHe desires what others do not,\nDoes not trade his nature for things,\nSo what need has he for rare treasures?\nHe is not without learning—\nHe learns what others do not,\nDoes not take deception as his mind.\nAll that the multitude errs in,\nHe returns to correct—\nThus it is said:\nThe Sage desires without desiring,\nDoes not prize hard-to-obtain wealth,\nLearns without learning,\nCorrects the multitude’s errors,\nTo reach the point of neither aiding life\nNor prolonging it,\nFollowing things in their natural course,\nWith no room for private interference.\n\nThe **Dao** can be a parent,\n**Virtue** (*dé*) a friend—\nWith **Dao** and **virtue** supporting his form,\nIn every matter, he acts spontaneously—\nHow could he dare to contrive?\n\n**Master Wu says:**\nThe Sage’s desire is to *not desire* as desire,\nHis learning is to *not learn* as learning.\nHard-to-obtain wealth—\nWhat others desire, he does not prize—\nThis is to not desire what is desirable,\nHence it is said: *\"Desire not-desire.\"*\nWhat the multitude pursues, he does not pursue;\nWhat the multitude dismisses with a shrug, he returns to—\nThis is to not learn what others learn,\nHence it is said: *\"Learn not-learning.\"*\nAll these—*not desiring, not learning*—\nAre because the **principle** (*lǐ*) of all things\nIs to act without action, naturally.\nThus I too act without action,\nIn harmony with all things, as spokes unite in a wheel.\n\n**Master He says:**\nThis chapter first speaks of acting before action,\nThen of those who act failing at completion,\nAnd finally of daring not to act.\nSo is acting correct, or not acting?\nBoth are correct—\nIs it not said:\n*\"Act without action,\nAnd nothing remains ungoverned.\"*\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nWhat the multitude does not desire, the Sage desires;\nWhat the multitude prizes, the Sage does not prize—\nThis is metaphorical speech.\nWhat the multitude does not learn, the Sage learns;\nWhat the multitude passes by without a glance, the Sage turns back to—\n*Return* (*fǔ*) is also metaphorical speech.\nThe Sage, thus acting in all things,\nHolds a heart of *daring not to act*,\nOnly then can he aid the natural unfolding of all things.\n\n---\n**Chapter 65**\nThe ancients who excelled in the **Dao**\nDid not enlighten the people—\nThey sought to make them simple.\nThe people are hard to govern\nBecause their cleverness is excessive.\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nIn ancient times, those who governed well\nGathered the people with **Dao**,\nOpened their innate nature to the

followed them their whole lives\nWithout knowing why.\nThose who govern well with **Dao**\nDo not display their brilliance to dazzle the vulgar,\nIn harmony with the unknowing,\nEmbracing simplicity alone.\n\n**Master Wu says:**\nIn the ancient times, they governed without action,\nThe people were pure and unknowing.\nIn later times, they governed with action,\nThe people became artful and deceitful—\nHence their difficulty in governance.\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nCleverness is a burden to the **Dao**.\nThe Sage’s teaching of others\nAlways seeks to obscure their cleverness,\nLest they burden themselves—\nHence it is said:\n*\"Not to enlighten the people,\nBut to make them simple.\"*\nThe more cunning and skillful the people,\nThe harder they are to govern—\nThus governing with cleverness\nBecomes the ruin of the state.\nNot governing with cleverness\nIs the state’s blessing.\nKnow these two principles—\nThis is called **Mysterious Virtue** (*Xuándé*).\n**Mysterious Virtue** is profound and distant,\nOpposed to things—\nOnly then does one reach **Great Harmony** (*Dàshùn*).\n\n**Master Lin says:**\nGoverning with cleverness\nBecomes the ruin of the state—\nFor if superiors and inferiors all rely on cunning,\nChaos ensues, and treacherous ministers and rebellious sons\nSeize power and rely on strength—\nWhat more could there be?\nThis is not called governing with cleverness—what is?\nIf one governs the self with cleverness,\nThe spirits grow unsettled—\nHow could one not steal one’s **true qi**?\n\n**Master Lü says:**\nIf the cleverness of bows,

with the world in the realm of contrivances and schemes,\nBut governs cleverness with simplicity,\nDrawing it back to the Dao of ease and straightforwardness—\nHow could this not be so?\nThus it is said: *The Sage*.\n\nIf cleverness exists without the Dao,\nThen the world falls into great chaos.\nHow do we know this is so?\nWhen the cleverness of bows, crossbows, and snares abounds,\nThen birds are disturbed in the sky.\nWhen the cleverness of nets, traps, and hooks abounds,\nThen fish are disturbed in the water.\nWhen the cleverness of deceit, poison, and sophistry—\nThe debates of *jié* and *huá*, the distinctions of firm and white,\nThe arguments of impurity and purity, of same and different—abounds,\nThen people are bewildered by discourse.\nThus the world often falls into great chaos,\nAnd the fault lies in the love of cleverness—\nThis has been so since the Three Dynasties.\n\nTo govern a nation with cleverness is to harm the people,\nTo govern without cleverness is to bless them.\nTo know these two models is also a standard—\nThis is the fine law for those who rule.\nTo always uphold this fine law,\nThen the virtue becomes profound, deep, and distant.\n\nThus it is said:\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast, their transformation is uniform,\nThough myriad things abound, their governance is one,\nThough the people are countless, their ruler is singular.\nThe ruler originates from virtue and is completed by Heaven—\nThus it is said:\nThe ancient Sage who ruled the world did so with *wuwei*,\nFor his virtue was that of Heaven itself.\n\nTo stand contrary to things—\nThey rely on their cleverness,\nI rely on the **Mysterious Virtue**,\nThey rely on harm,\nI rely on blessing—\nOpposite yet never conflicting.\nStraight speech as if reversed,\nThis is the **Great Harmony**—\nThe ultimate harmony.\nHow could it lie in private scheming or cleverness,\nIn clashing with things like blades,\nAnd yet be unable to stop?\n\n○ **Master Li** says:\n*Wuwei* is broad and generous,\nBringing peace to the world—\nThis is the people’s blessing.\n*Youwei* is meticulous and strict,\nDominating the people—\nThis is the nation’s ruin.\nThe difficulty in governing the people lies in their many affairs,\nThus the Sage governs the nation with *wuwei* and tranquility,\nSo that the clever may dare not act.\nThough contrary to things,\nThis reversal penetrates natural spontaneity—\nThe people follow their nature,\nReaping a hundredfold blessings,\nThe world attains peace,\nAnd the **Great Harmony** is fulfilled.\nTo exhaust this Dao is to embody the **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six**\nThe reason the rivers and seas can be kings of the myriad valleys\nIs that they excel in humility.\nThus they become kings of the myriad valleys.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says:\nThe rivers and seas reign over the myriad valleys\nThrough humility and lowliness,\nThrough emptiness and receptivity,\nThrough *wuwei* and seeking nothing—\nAnd the hundred rivers naturally flow to them.\nFrom this, we see that humility as Dao is great indeed.\nIn the human body, the lower *dantian* at the navel is the *qihai* (Sea of Qi),\nThe origin of the five *zàng* and six *fǔ*’s vital breath,\nThe source of the thirteen thousand five hundred breaths,\nThe ancestor of the twelve meridians.\nIf one diligently guards the *qihai* without interruption,\nThen the *qi* of the hundred passes naturally converges there.\n\n○ **Master He** says:\nThe rivers and seas do not resist the smallest streams,\nThus they achieve their greatness,\nNaturally embodying the majesty of ruling the myriad valleys—\nYet this greatness is not forced.\nWater has no division of east and west,\nOnly division of high and low.\nThe sea resides below, and thus the myriad valleys naturally pay homage.\nThe Classic says:\n*\"The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the seas.\"*\nWhat Dao is this?\nThe Sage-King knows to embrace the yielding to guard the strong.\n\n○ **Master Lin** says:\nThe waters of the myriad valleys all flow to the rivers and seas,\nAnd though the rivers and seas are the exalted kings of the valleys,\nThey yet reside below the myriad valleys—\nThis is a metaphor borrowed from things,\nExpressing the intent of humbling oneself to be exalted by others.\nThus the Sage, desiring to rise above others,\nMust first speak in humility.\nDesiring to lead others,\nMust first place himself behind them.",
      "overlap_context": "verning with cleverness—what is?\nMoreover, in ancient times,\nThose who ruled nations\nUsed knots and markings on the ground—\nTheir governance was subtle,\nTheir people pure—\nWithout governance, they governed themselves,\nThus opening the people’s **innate nature** (*tiān*),\nYet still not as opening the **Heaven’s nature** (*tiān*).\nThis is not called not governing with cleverness—what is?\nIf one governs the self with cleverness,\nThe spirits grow unsettled—\nHow could one not steal one’s **true qi**?",

says:\n*\"To humble his words\"* means to lower and bend his speech,\nNot to exalt it.\n*\"To place himself behind\"* means to retreat his body,\nNot to advance it.\nYet these are all the Sage’s supreme virtues of modesty and yielding—\nNot that he harbors any intent to stand above or lead others.\nThe reader must not let the words obscure the meaning.\n\n○ **Master Lin** says:\nThe Sage does not first desire to stand above or lead others\nAnd then act accordingly.\nHis intent is simply this:\nEven the Sage, though he desires to stand above or lead others,\nStill acts in this way—\nHow much more so others!\nBecause he does not contend,\nThe world cannot contend with him.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says:\nThe Sage always treats his body as empty,\nHis heart as non-being.\nOnce his mind and form are settled,\nWho could contend with him?\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"You alone do not boast,\nAnd thus none can contend with your ability.\nYou alone do not vaunt yourself,\nAnd thus none can contend with your achievements.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nThe Perfect One forgets his ears and eyes,\nDiscards his liver and gall,\nDissolves all attachments,\nErases all distinctions of self and

I am great—\nYet I seem unworthy.\nOnly because I am great\nDo I seem unworthy.\nIf I were worthy,\nLong ago I would have been insignificant.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says:\nThe Dao is vast and formless, nameless,\nFilling all things.\nThough it exists, it seems as if it does not—\nIts likeness to all things is nonexistent.\nThis is why it is great.\nIf it were to resemble any thing,\nThe Dao would itself be a thing—\nAnd how could it then be great?\n\n○ **Master Dong** says:\nIf it resembles anything,\nIt would be identical to one thing—\nHow could it then be great?\n\n○ **Master He** says:\nThe Sage holds himself in profound virtue,\nNot desiring to be seen as honored in the world.\nThus, the world regards him as boundlessly great,\nWithout resemblance to anything.\n\nOnly the great are indistinct and obscure—\nNo one can name them.\nIf they resemble anything,\nThey are merely petty in conduct.\n\n○ **Master Lin** says:\nOne manuscript adds *\"the Dao\"* after *\"I\"* and *\"also\"* after *\"insignificant\"*—\nBoth are errors.\n\nI have three treasures, which I hold fast.\nThe first is *compassion*,\nThe second is *frugality*,\nThe third is *not daring to lead the world*.\n\n○ **Master Lü** says:\nIf a person embraces the Dao and governs himself\nAs one would hold a treasure,\nHe must surely cherish and guard it without loss.\nThe three practices he follows are:\nTo embody benevolence and widely bestow kindness,\nNurturing all living beings—this is *compassion*.\nTo use resources moderately and enrich others,\nNot exhausting what belongs to all—this is *frugality*.\nTo never initiate action,\nHarmonizing without instigating,\nDaring not to lead—this is *not daring to lead*.\n\nThe Perfect One who preserves these three treasures\nExtends broad relief to all suffering,\nClothes and shelters all things—\nThis is the utmost of *compassion*.\nFrugality in hearing and seeing preserves the spirit from agitation,\nFrugality in speech preserves the *qi* from depletion,\nFrugality in desires preserves the heart from disturbance—\nThis is the supreme treasure for nourishing life.\nAble to place himself behind others,\nHis humility naturally elevates

people,\nSpared the crops and graves,\nNot plundered nor burned—\nThus all rejoice in them.\nWhy must one array soldiers to fight,\nAnd only then achieve victory?\nHeavily barred doors and nightly guards\nAre the ways of defense and security.\n\nThus the Dao of Heaven rewards the virtuous and punishes the licentious,\nThe virtuous are naturally shielded by Heaven,\nTheir hearts and wills opened,\nSo they may be *compassionate* toward all things,\nAnd when *compassionate* toward all things,\nThe world protects them.\nThe Perfect One can defend *compassionate* bravery against the world’s entanglements,\nThen no thousand demons dare approach,\nAnd his Dao grows ever more secure.\nFor Heaven’s Dao knows no favorites,\nIt always aligns with the virtuous.\nThus it is said:\n*Compassion* in war brings victory,\nIn defense brings security,\nWhen Heaven intends to aid him,\nIt shields him with *compassion.*\n\n○ **Master Lin** says:\n*\"War\"* is interaction with things that stir the heart,\nJust as *Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"To engage with others is to clash—\nDaily, the heart struggles within itself.\"*\n*\"Defense\"* is like *Zhuangzi*’s *\"preserving pure* qi*\"—\nIf a man takes *compassion* as his master,\nThen externally he can conquer things,\nInternally he can preserve himself.\nThe earlier words on the three treasures,\nHere I expound upon one—\nTo be *compassionate* is to embrace the other two within.\n\n○ **Master Wu** says:\n*Compassion* is the Dao of life,\nThe virtue of *ren*,\nThe foremost of the three treasures,\nThus below this, I speak solely of *compassion*—\nThe other two treasures are contained within it.\n\n*Compassion* is what all men naturally love,\nLike a father and mother—\nWho would have a son who opposes his parents,\nWho attacks his parents?\n\nThus, to wage war with *compassion*\nIs to make men unwilling to resist—\nThis is true victory.\nTo defend with *compassion*\nIs to make men unwilling to assault—\nThis is true security.\n\nEven if there are raiders who come to attack or plunder,\nThose who aid their parents are many,\nAnd so they will surely be victorious and secure.\nOr if human strength is insufficient,\nHeaven will also aid and rescue them,\nNot allowing them to be defeated and scattered.\nHeaven’s aid comes because they are able to be *compassionate* and rescue others.\n\n○ **Master Li** says:\nThe single character *compassion*\nIn war brings victory,\nIn defense brings security—\n*Ren* is invincible,\nThis is true bravery.\n\n**Chapter 68:**\nThe good *scholar-official* does not rely on force,\nThe good warrior does not grow angry,\nThe good victor does not quarrel,\nThe good user of men places them below himself.\n\n○ **Master He** says:\nGongyi Bo was renowned for his

      "translated_text": "「Thus, the skillful in serving as the lower party are not aggressive—\nThis principle is clearly demonstrated in practice.\nIn *Zhuangzi*: the Market-South Comilou played with balls,\nYet the two families’ feud remained unresolved;\nSun Shu’ao lay content with his jade staff and feathered fan,\nYet the people of Ying cast down their weapons.\nThese are those who do not rage yet excel in battle,\nWho do not contend yet triumph in victory.\n\nHan Xin untied Guangwu Jun’s bonds,\nFacing east to acknowledge him as a teacher,\nSeeking strategies for Yan and Qi—\nThis is the skillful use of others as the lower party.\n\nThe ancient adept at being a warrior,\nDid not seek to be fierce and strong;\nIn battle, he did not yield to anger or rage,\nYet victory over the enemy came without clashing strength—\nFor the Dao/Way was preserved within him.\nThus, some say, *\"I excel in forming arrays!\"*\n*\"I excel in waging war!\"*—\nThis is a grave offense.\n\nWhen a sovereign cherishes virtue/power of benevolence,\nThe world finds no rival.\n\n○ The Wu School says: In ancient times, chariot warfare was practiced,\nWhere a warrior (*shi*) meant three armored soldiers on a chariot—\nThe left wielded the bow, the right the spear,\nThe central one drove the chariot, controlling the flags and drums,\nAll desired to be strong and aggressive in battle.\nSeventy-two foot soldiers served beneath the chariot,\nAnd when war was imminent, their courage was roused,\nTheir will to contend with the enemy sharpened,\nSo they might take victory.\n\nBut the benevolent way of wielding armies\nDoes not regard this as skillful.\n\nWarriors do not wish to be strong and aggressive,\nIn battle, they do not seek to overwhelm with rage—\nVictory over the enemy does not depend on matching strength,\nWeapons are not drawn—\nThe enemy will yield themselves.\nThis is the wisdom and ability of the ancients.\n\n○ The Lin School says: The excellence of these four lies\nIn the art of non-contention.\nThis is called the virtue/power of non-contention,\nThis is called the strength of using others,\nThis is called the harmony with Heaven’s ancient principle.\nThe He School says: The virtue/power of non-contention\nIs benevolence without reliance on force.\nThe strength of using others\nIs bending collective strategy to collective force.\nHarmony with Heaven’s ancient principle\nIs that Heaven’s Dao/Way does not contend yet excels in victory,\nAnd has endured since antiquity—\nThe Way reaches its utmost.\n\n○ The Lin School says: Because of its virtue/power of non-contention,\nIt can harmonize with Heaven,\nIt can bend collective force,\nAnd govern the world—\nSince antiquity, none have surpassed it.\nThus it is called the ancient principle.\n\n○ The Li School says: The virtue/power of non-contention,\nThe strength of using others,\nBoth are rooted in benevolence and mercy—\nThus it is called harmony with Heaven.\nBy cultivating oneself thus,\nOne’s form is preserved and life prolonged.\n\n○ The Chai School says: Only by aligning with the Dao/Way\nOf the ancient sages can one stand at Heaven’s utmost—\nThus it is called harmony with Heaven’s ancient principle.\n\n**Chapter 69: On Wielding Armies, there is a saying:**\n*\"I dare not act as the aggressor, but only as the respondent.\nI dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot.\"*\n\nThe He School says: *\"I dare not act as the aggressor, but only as the respondent\"*\nIs what is called *responding armies*—\nThus, *\"relieving chaos and punishing tyranny\"* is called *righteous armies*,\nAnd armies of righteousness are invincible.\nWhen one rises not by choice but necessity,\nThis is called *responding armies*—\nAnd armies that respond will prevail.\n\nTo fight over petty grievances,\nTo bear grudges and refuse to yield in anger—\nThis is called *armies of resentment*—\nAnd armies of resentment will be defeated.\n\nTo covet another’s land and treasures—\nThis is called *greedy armies*—\nAnd greedy armies will be broken.\n\nTo rely on the might of one’s state,\nTo boast of the multitude of one’s people,\nAnd to wish to intimidate the enemy—\nThis is called *proud armies*—\nAnd proud armies will perish.\n\nThese five principles Laozi once spoke to Wenzhongzi,\nNow he says: *\"I dare not act as the aggressor, but only as the respondent\"*\nMeans the aggressor strikes first,\nWhile the respondent answers afterward—\nNot by choice.\n\n*\"I dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot\"*\nMeans to advance when opportunity is seen,\nTo retreat when difficulty is known—\nThe utmost of caution,\nYet not cowardice.\nTo fear in battle yet succeed through careful planning.\n\n○ The Lü School says: Those who spoke of military strategy in antiquity\nMust have regarded the aggressor as the first to act,\nAnd the respondent as the second to answer.\nThe aggressor creates the situation,\nThe respondent counters the enemy.\n\nMoreover, the Sage’s armies are deep in strategy, subtle in deployment—\nThough enemies come, we sit and watch their movements,\nAdapting as they change,\nPressing only when forced,\nRising only when necessity demands.\nIf one acts lightly, this is called *reckless with the enemy*.\n\nGenerally, those who have intent to contend\nMay not necessarily win,\nWhile those without intent to contend\nMay not necessarily lose—\nStrategy and timing depend on circumstances.\n\nThe Perfect One responds to the world,\nWith one glance, one listening,\nOne word, one smile—\nA thousand threads of interaction,\nAll called *magical illusions*.\n\nThe resolution of victory in battle\nLies in not daring to act as the aggressor first,\nBut maintaining a posture as the respondent,\nEver dwelling in stillness and composure,\nWith spirit unshaken—\nAdvancing an inch means meeting resistance,\nRetreating a foot means avoiding contention.\nHence the saying: *\"On wielding armies, there is a saying:\nI dare not act as the aggressor, but only as the respondent,\nI dare not advance an inch without retreating a foot.\"*\n\nThus, in movement there is no formation,\nIn repelling there are no arms,\nIn drawing there are no enemies,\nIn grasping there are no soldiers.\n\nThe He School says: The usual state of armies is\nMovement has formation,\nRepelling has arms,\nDrawing has enemies to face,\nGrasping has soldiers to hold—\nYet here all are absent,\nAs though without hands to strike or fists to raise,\nAs though the enemy passes by like a teacher on a pillow or bed,\nBending without battle—\nThis is why it is so.\n\n*Eran* (扔), means to draw or lure—\nAs in repelling with arms yet *eraning* them to lure,\n*Eran* and *cai* (才) share the same sound in ancient texts,\nWith meaning akin to *waving the enemy away*.\n\n○ The Master of the River Above said:\nIf they persist in wrongdoing,\nThey become thieves to the world—\nYet even if I wish to execute them,\nNo proper formation can be made.\nThough I wish to rage in anger,\nIt is as though I have no arms to repel.\nThough I wish to draw and lure them,\nIt is as though there are no enemies to draw.\nThough I wish to grasp and hold them,\nIt is as though there are no soldiers to seize.\n\n○ The Lin School says: These are all feints of cowardice and weakness\nTo deceive the enemy’s calculations.\n*Eran* means to draw,\nTo lure the enemy to the teacher’s forces.\n\nThus, wielding armies in this way\nIs the path to true victory.\n\nTo act lightly against the enemy and boast in arrogance,\nOne is certain to meet ruin and defeat.\n\n○ The original text by Wang Bi retains *eran* (扔).\n\nNo calamity is greater than reckless contempt for the enemy—\nReckless contempt nearly loses all one holds dear.\n\nWhen armies clash in opposition,\nThe compassionate will prevail.\n\nThe He School says: Do not ask *\"what harm?\"*—\nThe peril is immense.\nThis is the warning against reckless contempt for the enemy,\nThe greatest of calamities.»",

      "translated_text": "The Way is known by none, practiced by none.\n\nMaster He said: What is the Way? It is clarity and stillness, simplicity and ease above all. The Way is inherently clear, yet people muddy it; inherently still, yet people agitate it; inherently simple, yet people complicate it; inherently easy, yet people make it difficult.\n\nThe Mysterious Sage speaks: To me, it is most easy to know and to practice; to others, it is impossible to know or to do. The method differs not—it is simply a return to its origin.\n\nTo speak of strength and rigidity is difficult; to speak of gentleness and weakness, is it not easy? To speak of ornate adornment is difficult; to speak of plainness and simplicity, is it not easy? Yet because it is so easy to know, people fail to know it; because it is so easy to practice, people fail to do it—because it is too near.\n\nLiezi could lift a single autumn hair and hear the thunder—these were the words of one who knew the Way.\n\nMaster Li said: The previous chapter spoke of the compassionate prevailing, meaning that benevolence is invincible. Thus, it follows with \"most easy to know, most easy to practice,\" yet the world cannot know or practice it—truly, their faith is insufficient. Even those with faith cannot act—truly, their strength is insufficient.\n\nMaster Wu said: The teachings of Laozi instruct one only in gentleness, weakness, and humility. His words are most easy to know, his deeds most easy to practice. Yet as the age declines and customs corrupt, none in the world can know their worth, nor practice gentleness, weakness, and humility.\n\nWords have their source, deeds have their master.\nOnly those without knowledge fail to recognize me.\nFew know me, thus I am noble.\n\nMaster He said: Laozi’s two phrases—\"words have their source, deeds have their master\"—yet he repeatedly speaks of discarding words, of doing without doing, saying, \"You have lost your origin.\" Though eloquence may abound, it is not as good as few words. This is so.\n\nHold fast to the essential, grasp the root—then you will know how to know, how to practice, how to make it easy.\nThere is nothing else: broad knowledge is difficult for the few; many revere this, and thus knowing becomes easy. Broad practice is difficult for the restless; many submit to this, and thus acting becomes easy.\n\nYet the teachings of the Way have three aspects: what is most easy is near; what is unknown is subtle; and what is without knowledge is forgotten. Thus, the Way, though easy to know, reaches the state of being unknown.\n\nThe Sage’s deeds are such: I transcend the realm of recognition and knowledge, who then can measure me?\nGuan Yinzi could forget the Way only to possess the Way. He also said: If someone asks me, I do not even know myself—how could I know what they seek? This is without words, without deeds, an inner knowing that embraces the Mysterious.\n\nI do not even know myself—how could others know me? If people can know the Way, what is there to value?\nThus, those who attain the Way fear being known by others, yet first fear knowing themselves. Self and others both forgotten—clouds and mist vanish together.\n\nThe most noble is the Way. The great sound is rare in voice—why seek knowledge at all?\nYet the difficulty and ease of knowing are not worth discussing.\n\nMaster Lin said: Among many words, there must be the supreme word, hence \"words have their source.\" All deeds in the world have the Way as their master, hence \"deeds have their master.\" Since the world lacks those who know the supreme word and the supreme Way, none recognize me, hence \"only those without knowledge fail to recognize me.\"\n\nThus, the Sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.\nMaster He said: Liezi dwelled in the fields of Zheng for forty years, unrecognized. Even the king and ministers regarded him as common folk. The virtuous man’s noble bearing appears foolish—thus, the Sage is like one wearing coarse cloth while harboring jade: externally unassuming, yet internally possessing the most noble treasure. *Pò* (褐) is coarse hemp cloth, the garment of the lowly, hence \"wide and ample.\"\n\nMaster Lü said: The Sage has no name; the Perfect Man has no self; the Divine Man has no brilliance. Though his robes are worn and his sandals threadbare, he nurtures his integrity beneath them. His heart is like jade and stone, accumulating the utmost treasure, concealing its radiance, never displaying it. He silently nurtures the embryo of the Way—thus, \"the Sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.\"\n\nMaster Lin said: The Sage’s Way suffices within and does not manifest without—like wearing coarse cloth while harboring jade. Thus, people cannot see it.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One**\nTo know what is unknown—this is supreme.",

It is vast and silent, deep and unfathomable—\nIt cannot be grasped by intellect, cannot be discerned by perception,\nCannot be measured or estimated, cannot be approximated or debated.\nKnowledge is external to it; ignorance is internal to it.\nKnowledge is shallow; ignorance is profound.\nThe Sage perceives the purity of *qi*—his inherent nature is lofty and bright.\nWithin, he harbors true knowledge; all things are naturally awakened.\nOnly then can he attain true ignorance, not boasting of himself—\nThis is called true knowledge and true perception,\nFor he knows the unknowing and the unperceiving.\n\nMoreover, the common folk do not know the essence of the Dao,\nYet they know the coarse aspects of things.\nThey do not know the ultimate of the Dao,\nYet they know the trifling ends of things.\nThey are enslaved by schemes and deceived by phenomena,\nTheir minds filled with cunning, vainly seeking grandeur,\nYet they truly do not know the Dao.\nThey exhaust their spirit, strain their thoughts,\nUsing elaborate words to extinguish essence, using superficiality to drown the heart,\nAnd forcefully argue and justify, claiming to know—\nThis is the malady of *virtue/power*.\n\nThe noble ones attain the Dao and clarify truth;\nThey possess it yet remain humble,\nSealing their lips and tongues,\nPreserving and concealing it, never daring to reveal it.\nThey always act as if ignorant—how much more so when they do not know the Dao—\nYet they indulge in lofty, boastful debates.\nDebaters are not virtuous; knowers are not profound; the profound are not knowers.\n\nMaster He said: The *Zhuangzi* states: \"There have been those who knew through hearing, but never those who knew through ignorance.\"\nHence, deep knowledge without presumption is the highest in the Dao.\nIn the realm of the unknowable, to forcefully presume knowledge—\nThis is the malady of learning the Dao.\nThe *Zhuangzi* says: *Taicheng* asked *Wuqiong*, \"Do you know the Dao?\"\nHe replied, \"I do not know.\"\nAgain, he asked *Wuwei*, \"I know the Dao.\"\nHe asked *Wuji* (the beginningless), and he replied,\n\"I do not know its depths;

people cannot but fear small harm.\nIf they do not fear small harm, great harm will arrive.\n\nMaster Lü said: The *junzi* (君子) has three fears:\nFear of Heaven’s decree (*天命*),\nFear of great *virtue/power* (大人),\nFear of the Sage’s words.\nIf one embodies constancy and adapts to change,\nPreserving the principles of life and death,\nThen within, true essence is manifest and fills all without.\nAnxiety and sorrow cannot penetrate it—\nWhat the multitude fears, one cannot but fear.\nThe foolish do not know Heaven’s decree,\nSeeking only grandeur and excess,\nBearing harm and relying on power,\nBoasting of their virtue and ability.\nThe *Zhuangzi* (*Nanhua Jing*) says:\nThe great foolish never awaken;\nThe great confused never enlighten.\nDo not say that minor evil causes no harm—\nIf one neglects it and does not repent,\nThen when harm accumulates over time,\nEven human *威* cannot be added,\nAnd Heaven’s *威* will surely come.\n\nMaster He said: The ancients said,\n\"To fear *威* as one fears illness is the highest for the people;\nTo follow *威* as one follows a flowing current is the lowest for the people;\nTo see *威* and think of *威* is the middle for the people.\"\nThus, the human heart must never lack something to fear.\nConfucius said: The *junzi* has three fears—\nFear of Heaven’s decree,\nFear of great *virtue/power* (大人),\nFear of the Sage’s words.\nThe petty do not fear Heaven’s decree,\nThey are familiar with great *virtue/power*,\nAnd scorn the Sage’s words.\nGreat *virtue/power* refers to the sternness of rulers and parents,\nAs well as the great *virtue/power* of the worthy—\nThese are indeed worthy of fear, not to be trifled with.\nThe Sage’s words: to violate his precepts,\nOne cannot escape punishment.\nTheir bodies are indeed worthy of fear, not to be scorned.\nYet among the three fears, fear of Heaven’s decree is paramount.\nHeaven’s decree is the natural principle bestowed upon all things by Heaven.\nTo fear it, every thought and word is under the gaze of Heaven and Earth, ghosts and gods—\nNone dare to play or neglect it.\nThe Dao is the shared source of all things; those who attain it live, those who lose it die.\nThe people receive the essence of Heaven and Earth to live,\nThe capable take blessings, the corrupt take calamity—\nThus, the *junzi* fears *yì* (义), the petty fear *xíng* (刑).\nBoth fear Heaven.\nIf one does not fear this *威*, then there is a greater *威*.\nThe *Yì* says: \"If evil is not accumulated, it is not enough to destroy one’s life.\"\nThe petty presume minor evil causes no harm and do not abandon it,\nSo evil accumulates and cannot be concealed,\nGuilt becomes great and cannot be absolved,\nAnd they are punished to death—*凶* (凶), is this not the great *威* that comes from not fearing *威*?\n\nMaster Lin said: Those who do not fear *xíng* (刑) will often meet it.\nDo not narrow one’s dwelling, do not weary of one’s birth—\nThus, one does not weary.\nMaster *He Shang Gong* said: The heart should dwell in the Divine (*神*), broad and gentle,\nNot narrow and rigid.\nThe reason people are born is to possess spirit *qi*—\nIf one neglects its Dao, indulging only in its superficial manifestations,\nThis is called harming the root and wearying the Divine.»",

      "translated_text": "Lin Shi said:\n*The killer is the Creator. Between Heaven and Earth, whether one does good or evil, there is always one who holds the authority over life and death. Those who should be killed are killed by the Creator itself, hence the saying that there is always one who holds the authority over killing. For a state to be overly concerned with punishment, it is as if one were substituting for the Creator in wielding the authority to kill. Just as a clumsy artisan replacing the master carpenter in cutting wood will rarely avoid injuring their own hands, this is a metaphor within a metaphor. This passage arises from the times’ excessive fondness for killing, yet its intent is not to entirely abolish punishment. Heaven’s retribution for guilt must simply be without malice.*\n\nWu Shi said:\n*If one does not use killing to instill fear in the people, then should those who commit evil not be killed? The one who holds the authority to kill is Heaven itself. Only Heaven can kill, just as only the master carpenter can carve wood. For a man to presume to replace Heaven in killing is like one who is not a carpenter attempting to carve wood in the master’s place. Those who substitute for the carpenter will inevitably injure their hands, and by analogy, those who substitute for Heaven in killing will inevitably harm themselves. Without human calamity, there must be Heaven’s punishment.*\n\nHe Shi said:\n*Though punishment may be wielded by one person, it is not the private domain of any single individual. There is always one who holds authority over punishment and killing. The ruler, in governing, should not presume to take this role upon themselves. Who, then, is the one who holds the authority to kill? Above, there is one who operates in the unseen—Heaven’s retribution for guilt, the Five Punishments, and their proper applications. Below, there is one who operates in the manifest—*as the *Shu* says: *\"The officers regulate the people within the bounds of punishment.\"* The ruler, holding the reins in between, enforces punishment only when necessary. When such necessity arises, they uphold Heaven’s decrees and entrust the matter to the proper authorities, demonstrating fair governance to the people: *\"The people have their own guilt; what concern is it of mine?\"* Killing is the domain of Heaven, of the officers—not mine. Who would dare blame their ruler for this? If this is not followed, it defies Heaven’s order, misuses official punishment, and arrogates its authority as one’s own—just as if the master carpenter should step aside while another, bloodied and exhausted, takes their place in cutting wood. Would this not bring harm?*\n\n*The ruler, with the heart of Heaven and humanity, desires goodness, and thus the people become good. Why then the need for killing? If a ruler governs thus, the world will shift toward virtue and away from guilt, all cherishing life and valuing death. They will welcome the great harmonizing *qi*, this being the unspoken intent of the Sage.*\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Five**\n*The people’s hunger arises from their rulers taking too much in taxes. Thus, they hunger. The people are difficult to govern because their rulers act excessively. Thus, they are difficult to govern.*\n\nLin Shi said:\n*\"Too much in taxes\"* refers to the ruler taking excessively from the people. *\"Their rulers act excessively\"* means those in governance overuse schemes and stratagems. When the ruler is greedy for profit, the people grow hungrier. When the ruler favors cleverness, the people grow harder to govern.\n\nWu Shi said:\n*\"Food\"* refers to what the ruler takes from the people, while *\"taxes\"* are what the people contribute to sustain the ruler’s consumption. If the ruler takes too much from the people, the people grow poor and hungry. If the ruler governs with schemes and stratagems, the people respond with deceit and trickery, making governance difficult.\n\nLü Shi said:\n*The people are the foundation of the state. Of the Eight Governments, food is the priority. Though the discussion of food may seem trivial, the Minister of Agriculture oversees it as a matter of great consequence. If this is mismanaged, harm to the people will be severe. The Sage allotted land, exhorted officials, and ensured they did not disrupt the seasons. Taxation was regulated to avoid overburdening the people. The *Nine-Tenths* law was relaxed, and the *Tenth* tax was established—prioritizing what was lightest. If, however, the ruler disregards the people’s proper seasons, drains their strength with extraordinary demands to satisfy insatiable desires, the people will suffer under the crushing weight of taxes. Exhausted and emaciated, they will show signs of famine, the wilds will echo with the cries of the starving, bandits and thieves will multiply, and deceit will flourish unseen within the state. The body relies on *qi* for the people’s vitality; when *qi* is depleted, the spirit weakens. Now, speaking of their hunger is to say their *qi* is insufficient. This is why they cannot abandon speech and desire—hence, *\"The people’s hunger arises from their rulers taking too much in taxes. Thus, they hunger.\"* In ancient times, the people lived in peace, content with their customs, their fields yielding enough to eat, their weaving enough to wear. Who would say they were difficult to govern? But if the ruler acts with excess, desire, and interference—imposing dense nets of laws, harsh decrees, and convoluted governance—they will only agitate the people, who cannot endure such disturbance. Thus, they are difficult to govern. It is like one’s own breath: difficult to purify but easy to foul, easy to coarsen but difficult to refine. How much more so when the ruler’s actions agitate it further?*\n\n*The people’s indifference to death arises from their excessive pursuit of life. Only those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.*\n\nLin Shi said:\n*Generally, those who love themselves too much risk losing their lives. Overindulgence in food and drink can bring illness—this is one example. Overvaluing self-preservation and excessive care for life lead to reckless schemes to secure it, hence *\"the excessive pursuit of life.\"* They risk their lives in pursuit of it, hence *\"indifferent to death.\"* To forget the self is to preserve the self, hence *\"those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\"* To prize life is akin to the previous chapter’s *\"increasing life\"*—the excessive pursuit of life. *\"Prize\"* here means *\"excel.\"**\n\nWu Shi said:\n*\"Indifferent\"* means *\"easy.\"* *\"The excessive pursuit of life\"* refers to an overattachment to living. *\"Wiser\"* means *\"excel.\"* To prize life is to hold it in high regard, the same as the excessive pursuit of life. When one’s attachment to life is heavy and self-preservation is overdone, they may seek not to die yet instead make death easy. The perfected do not fail to cherish life, but they follow nature, harboring no contrivances. If one does not cling to life, their body remains unharmed—this excels over those who prize life with their hearts, yet paradoxically make death easy.",

      "translated_text": "He Shi said:\n*\"Those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who prize it.\"* This is what is meant by *\"harmonizing with the Creator\"* and *\"wandering in the unified qi of Heaven and Earth.\"* They forget their liver and gallbladder, abandon their ears and eyes, reversing and returning to the beginning and end without knowing where to start or stop. Lost in the vastness beyond dust and filth, they drift effortlessly in the realm of *wuwei*, unharmed by things. This surpasses those who excessively cherish life—through this, all under Heaven preserve their lives. Is this not wondrous?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Six**\n*\"The living are soft and weak; the dead are rigid and strong.*\n*All things—grasses and trees—are soft and brittle when alive; when dead, they wither and decay.\"*\n\nLu Shi said:\n*\"The Dao is the master of the spirit; the spirit is the master of qi; qi is the master of the body. When the Dao abides, the spirit abides; when the spirit abides, qi abides. Thus, when a person is born, they contain the primordial *yuanhe* qi and embrace the true unity of essence. Their form is whole, their spirit flourishes, and the myriad *jing* converge at the origin, flowing and ceasing not. Hence, their softness and weakness are evident.*\n\n*When they die, the *yuanhe* qi disperses, the true unity of essence is exhausted, the form decays, and the spirit departs. Then the hundred limbs grow rigid and strong. Hence it is said: ‘The living are soft and weak; the dead are rigid and strong.’*\n\n*Consider this: when grasses and trees are born, the qi of Heaven and Earth flows within them, and the yin-yang qi nourishes them without. When spring qi stirs, the nourishing rain falls abundantly, and sprouts unfold in lush splendor. Yet when frost and wind blow, killing qi follows, and they wither, their branches and twigs decaying.*\n\n*The enlightened see life and death as the abiding or fading of the Dao; the unenlightened see vitality and decay as the gathering or scattering of qi. Hence it is said: ‘All things—grasses and trees—are soft and brittle when alive; when dead, they wither and decay.’\"*\n\nWu Shi said:\n*\"When a person lives, their flesh and skin are soft and supple, capable of bending and stretching. When dead, their flesh and skin grow cold and rigid, unable to bend or stretch. Grasses and trees, when alive, have pliable stems; when dead, their stems wither and harden.\"*\n\nLin Shi said:\n*\"Soft and weak, rigid and strong—these are metaphors. Laozi’s teaching emphasizes valuing softness, thus using the birth and death of humans and plants as illustrations. Therefore, those who are rigid and strong are companions of death, while those who are soft and weak are companions of life.\"*\n\nLu Shi said:\n*\"Where yang qi resides, even wood can be bent and grass bound. Where yang qi departs, even water can congeal and ice shatter. Thus, the luminous yang qi is the root of life. Softness and weakness are the sprouts of things. Those who seek rigidity must guard it with softness; those who seek strength must preserve it with weakness. Now, rigidity cannot nurture harmony—it opposes things. How could it avoid harm? Softness and weakness do not lose the mean—they move with things, thus preserving life.\"*\n\nHe Shi said:\n*\"The soft and weak of the world—the Dao and qi—are what permeate Heaven and Earth and embrace all things. Thus, those who align with life must have the Dao and qi within them; those who align with death must have the Dao and qi depart from them.\"*\n\nLin Shi said:\n*\"Companions—here meaning ‘kindred.’\"*\n\nWu Shi said:\n*\"The earlier text speaks of the forms of humans and plants—when alive, they are soft; when dead, they are rigid. Extending this principle, one sees that those whose conduct is rigid and strong do not attain death properly—they are companions of death. Those who are soft and weak preserve life well—they are companions of life. Hence, strong armies do not conquer, and strong trees are felled. The strong and mighty are placed below; the soft and weak are placed above.\"*\n\nLu Shi said:\n*\"Arms are instruments of violence and conflict, clashing with opposing forces. Relying on strength and despising the enemy is unrighteous. To act unrighteously and yet presume victory—how could it succeed? Thus it is said: ‘Strong arms do not conquer.’ Small trees are soft and weak, but when they grow strong, they become thick enough to encircle with both hands. If wood is thus, how much more so for humans? How much more so for nations? Hence it is said: ‘Strong trees are felled.’ The strong and mighty are bold warriors; the soft and weak embody the Way of the gentleman. Those who rely on force see strength as victory; those who rely on virtue see softness as victory. Thus, there is an eternal victorious Way called softness, and an eternal defeated Way called rigidity. Alas, the world’s people rely on force, not virtue, forgetting the root and chasing the branches. The enlightened observe this with the Dao, and thus know that softness overcomes rigidity—this is the necessary truth.\"*\n\nHe Shi said:\n*\"Sharp teeth break; the soft tongue survives—this is the way. ‘Felled’ as in encircling a tree with both hands—things grow old when they reach their peak; this is called *not the Dao*. Why do strong arms fail to conquer? Because they rely on the might of their nation, boast in their people’s numbers, and seek to intimidate enemy states—these are *proud armies*, and proud armies perish. The strong and mighty are placed below; the soft and weak are placed above—not merely an analogy with trees, but the application of softness to govern the world, which is the Way of the sovereign. To arrogantly exalt oneself is but the shortsightedness of a well-frog. Can those in high station not take heed? It is not only Daoists who uphold humility and weakness.\"*\n\nLin Shi said:\n*\"Those who rely on the strength of arms will not conquer. Young trees are soft and weak; when they grow old and rigid, they reach a thickness where they can be encircled with both hands—then they wither. Thus, those who understand the Dao value softness and weakness as superior, and rigidity and strength as inferior.\"*\n\nWu Shi said:\n*\"‘Felled’—the encircling of a tree with both hands.\"*\n\nDong Shi said:\n*\"This chapter speaks of how softness and weakness preserve the harmonious qi.\"*\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven**\n*\"The Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow: the high are lowered, the low are raised, the excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\"*",

Hence, it is said: ‘The Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow.’*\n\n*Now, the artisan who crafts a bow—without slaying or sparing, without favor or coercion—shapes it by compass and square, guided by true measure.

Thus, we are far from the Dao.\"*\n\n○ *Lin Shi said:*\n*\"Heaven, in its treatment of all things, is ever thus.*\n*Yet why does humanity’s Way differ? It seeks to diminish others while benefiting itself, to take from the world’s deficiency to fill its own excess—this is contrary to Heaven’s intent.*\n*Who can sacrifice their own excess to nourish the world? Only those who embody the Dao.\"*\n\n○ *Lü Shi said:*\n*\"Moreover, excess cannot be left untrimmed, deficiency cannot be left unsupplemented.*\n*Thus, those who embody the Dao do not only love their own kin nor only cherish their own children—they love the world’s children as their own. In their regard for others, they are heavy; in their regard for themselves, they are light. Who but the sages could achieve this?*\n*Hence the saying: ‘Who can sacrifice their own excess to nourish the world? Only those who embody the Dao.’\"*\n\n○ *Lin Shi said:*\n*\"Only those who embody the Dao can diminish my excess to nourish the world.\"*\n\n○ *Li Shi said:*\n*\"Only those who embody the Dao act in accordance with Heaven, diminishing artificiality while benefiting true nature, diminishing abundance while supplementing scarcity, diminishing self while benefiting others, diminishing excess and supplementing deficiency—diminishing again and again until it reaches the state of non-action.*\n*Hence, the sage acts yet does not rely on his deeds, achieves yet does not claim his accomplishments, and does not desire to be seen as virtuous. He does not boast of his own excellence or seek self-satisfaction; though his deeds are done and his affairs settled, he does not dwell upon them. He does not wish for the world to know his virtue—if his virtue were manifest to all, then he would be esteeming himself, which is not the way of the Dao.\"*\n\n○ *Lü Shi said:*\n*\"The sage’s wisdom is all-encompassing, his mind adapts to all things. Though he benefits all things, he does not claim righteousness; though his grace extends to all ages, he does not claim benevolence. He has no intent to praise himself, acting yet not boasting of his skill, nor seeking self-fulfillment. When his deeds are accomplished and his affairs settled, he does not dwell upon them—he does not wish for others to know his virtue. If his virtue were made known to the world, then he would be esteeming himself, which is not the way of the Dao.\"*\n\n○ *Lin Shi said:*\n*\"Though the sage acts in the world, he does not rely on his deeds; though his accomplishments are realized, he does not claim them; though his conduct is the most virtuous, he does not wish to be seen for it. This is the Dao’s principle of continual diminishment—until one diminishes even the act of diminishment.\"*\n\n○ *Wu Shi said:*\n*\"The sage’s achievements can cover the world—this is his excess. Yet he does not rely on his own ability, as though he had none; he does not claim his own accomplishments, as though he had none; he does not desire to display his ability as superior to others. All of these are acts of diminishing his own excess.\"*\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight**\n*\"In the world, there is none softer or weaker than water, yet none better at overcoming hardness and strength—nothing can replace it.\"*\n\n○ *Lü Shi said:*\n*\"The things of the world vary, yet none surpasses water in its extreme softness and weakness. It levels mountains, erodes stone, clears blockages, overcomes hardness and strength, benefiting all things and entering all things. It follows the dictates of man—whether confined or released—and adapts to the shape of its vessel, whether square or round. It transforms into vapor, into clouds and rain, into frost and snow. Hence, Heaven first generates water, from which springs the ceaseless flow of sources and streams, vast and boundless, though winding a thousand times or turning a million times, it never ceases to be water. This is the embodiment of the marvelous unity of the harmonious qi.*\n\n*Yet in its application to all things, water can be strong or weak, rigid or soft—thus it can overcome all things, approaching the Dao, and nothing can replace it.*\n\n*In the body, there is none softer or weaker than the essence of Hua Tu (华池灵液). The perfected one circulates and directs it, reaching every place. Sometimes they rinse and swallow it to irrigate the five viscera; sometimes they manipulate and transport it to reach the three pass points. Even to the point of permeating the lower back’s aperture (透尾闾), passing the spine’s interstices (过夹脊), flowing upward against the current (泝流直上), and supplementing the brain (而补於脑)—none but the divine water could achieve this.\"*\n\n○ *He Shi said:*\n*\"Water can be directed east or west to flow. In the world, there is none more supremely soft and weak than water. It erodes the stone of Tai Mountain (穿太山之石), breaches a thousand-golden floodbank (决千金之堤), and overcomes hardness and strength—this is an unalterable truth from ancient to modern times.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「○ Lin Shi said: Water is supremely weak yet can overcome hardness and strength—none in the world can rival it. The thousand-golden floodbank (千金之堤) is undone by the leak of an ant’s burrow (蚁穴之漏), thus proving that weakness can triumph over strength, and none can surpass water in this.\n\nWeakness triumphing over strength, softness overcoming hardness—none in the world does not know this, yet none can practice it.\n\n○ Lü Shi said: Water extinguishes fire, yin subdues yang; the tongue is soft yet the teeth are hard, yet when the tongue survives, the teeth perish. None in the world does not know this, yet it is a common saying among the vulgar.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven does not contend with things, yet thus overcomes them. Common folk always desire to contend with things, yet few can overcome them.\n\nIndeed, those who know yet cannot practice it cannot achieve their aims in the world; those who know and can practice it may achieve their aims in the world.\n\n○ He Shi said: In the *Liezǐ* (《列子》), it is said that there are unchanging ways of victory and unchanging ways of defeat. The unchanging way of victory is called *softness* (柔), the unchanging way of defeat is called *strength* (强). These two principles are easy to know, yet people do not recognize them. Master Huangshi (黄石公) instructed Zhifang (子房), yet only spoke of *softness overcoming hardness* (柔胜刚) and *weakness overcoming strength* (弱胜强). This is a principle easy to know yet not understood, and even those who know it cannot practice it—only the sage can know and practice it.\n\n○ Lin Shi said: Weakness overcoming strength, softness overcoming hardness—like water, this is plainly visible, yet none in the world can practice it. The supreme Dao/Way lies in those who can be soft and weak, yet none can practice this.\n\n○ Li Shi said: Softness overcomes hardness, weakness overcomes strength—all know this yet none can practice it. Why? Because they refuse to humble themselves. Hence, the sage says:\n\n*\"To bear the filth of the state (受国之垢) is to be called its sovereign (社稷主).\nTo bear the misfortunes of the state (受国之不祥) is to be called the King of the world (天下王).\nTo speak straight yet reverse the meaning (正言若反).\"*\n\n○ Lü Shi said: The sage’s virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth are supremely vast, encompassing all things great and small, coarse and fine, and their likes and dislikes. The sage is supremely exalted, and all—wise and foolish, noble and ignoble—turn to him for support.\n\nAgain, the sage can endure filth and conceal it, tolerate insults and embrace chaos, thus aiding the Dao/Way of *ren* (仁) and *yi* (义), of softness and weakness overcoming strength. Then the people revere his virtue and do not scatter. He can perpetually serve as the sovereign of the state (社稷主).\n\nThe sage practices humility and submission, following Heaven’s course. Wars, calamities, droughts, and locust plagues are all the fate of *effort* (劫运), which Heaven sometimes uses to admonish people. If the sage does not lay blame upon others but instead takes it upon himself, then the Four Seas will return to *ren* (仁), and the Six Directions will find their home in his heart. Thus, he can become the King of the world (天下王).\n\nHence it is said: *\"To bear the misfortunes of the state (受国不祥) is to be called the King of the world (天下王).\"*\n\nThe vulgar regard bearing filth and misfortunes as something to be reviled, yet the sage regards them as something to be rejoiced in. Rejoicing in what others revile may not necessarily bring fortune; reviling what others rejoice in may not necessarily bring disaster.\n\nTo speak straight yet reverse the meaning (正言若反)—this is because the vulgar conceal their own faults while exposing others’, whereas the sage acknowledges his own faults while concealing others’. Thus, their words diverge; only the sage’s words are truly upright, hence *\"to speak straight yet reverse the meaning.\"*\n\n○ He Shi said: The term *\"orphans, widows, and the destitute\"* (孤寡不谷) is used by kings and nobles, all of which reflect the principle of *softness overcoming hardness* (柔胜刚). This is the true principle of the world, yet people do not know or practice it. When they hear the sage speak of *softness overcoming hardness*, they think it contradictory, yet it is truly the correct teaching.\n\n○ Dong Shi said: This chapter states that softness and weakness, when able to contain, become what all things turn to. The seventy-ninth chapter says: *\"To reconcile great grievances (和大怨) must leave some remnant grievance; how can this be called a good Dao/Way?\"*\n\n○ Lin Shi said: Only when one forgets both恩 (恩) and怨 (grievance) does one know the supreme Dao/Way. If a person harbors great怨 (grievance) against me yet I still desire to reconcile it, though I have no lingering resentment, I still recognize that it is a grievance. Then this heart is not yet transformed.\n\nThough it is said that I can reconcile it, my heart is not yet transformed, so the remnant grievance remains. How can this be called a good Dao/Way? This is indeed a profound statement, yet it is also an analogy.\n\n○ Lü Shi said: Grievances and enmities have already run deep, and the chasm between enemies is already vast. Even if one ultimately concedes what is right and wrong, affirming what is wrong and denying what is right, repays them with virtue, and straightens them with righteousness, how could there ever be no lingering regret?\n\nIt is better to forget both恩 (恩) and怨 (grievance), and let the Dao/Way reconcile and transform them. Then the grieved will not need reconciliation before they are already reconciled.\n\nBiqiuzi (碧虚子) said that knowing of a grievance yet reconciling it is not as good as having no grievance to reconcile. If one reconciles and repays grievances with laws and governance, how can this be called a good Dao/Way?\n\n○ Li Shi said: Building upon the previous chapter’s principle of *hardness and softness*, to reconcile with恩 (恩), though grievances may be resolved, the heart remains unchanged. How can this be called a good Dao/Way? It is better to blame oneself and forget both恩 (恩) and怨 (grievance). When恩 (恩) and怨 (grievance) are both forgotten, the people will naturally feel gratitude and respond with loyalty.\n\nHence, the sage holds the *left contract* (执左契) yet does not demand repayment from others.\n\n○ Lin Shi said: The *left contract* (左契) is like the written agreements of today. One party holds the left half, the other holds the right half, hence the term *left contract*.\n\nIf this contract is held by me, then the other party must fulfill their obligations. Though the sage holds this contract, he does not demand repayment from others, but instead forgets and transforms.\n\n○ Lü Shi said: In ancient times, people tied knots in ropes to make agreements, yet the people did not deceive. They split wooden tablets to make contracts, yet the people did not violate them. Thus, the sage harmonized human Dao/Way with Heaven’s Dao/Way, and human heart with Heaven’s heart. Hence, holding the contract on the left (执左契) signifies agreement, and combining it on the right (合之于右) signifies trust. Not demanding repayment from others also corresponds with Heaven’s will. Here, there is no blame; there, there is no fault. Above and below are in harmony, and there is no blame for grievances. Hence it is said: *\"The sage holds the left contract yet does not demand repayment from others.\"*\n\n○ Wu Shi said: *\"The sage holds the left contract yet does not demand repayment from others\"* means he has no expectations of things.\n\nThe *contract* (契) is a wooden tablet split in two, with each party keeping one half to demonstrate sincerity. When one demands repayment of money or goods from another, it is called *responsibility* (责). The contract has left and right halves: the left half is held by the party who gives the money or goods, and the right half is given to the party who comes to take them. Master Lin of Lichuan (临川王氏) said: The *Shiji* (《史记》) states: *\"He held the left contract to demand repayment\"* (操左契以责事), and the *Liji* (《礼记》) states: *\"Those who offer land and residences hold the left contract\"* (献田宅者操左契). Thus, it is known that the left half is held by the party who receives responsibility.»",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the virtuous govern through trust, while the unvirtuous demand clarity.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven favors none, yet always aids the good.\nMaster Lin said: The virtuous hold the contract, yet seek nothing in return. The unvirtuous, however, demand only clarity.\n*Simply* (彻) means to make clear.\nIt is like when people today say, *\"Let us settle this clearly\"* (必与之讨分晓).\n\nThose who govern through virtue are the good—Heaven, without favor, aids such people, hence it is said: *\"Heaven always aids the good.\"*\n\nMaster He said: The contract is a binding agreement, like written covenants or pacts.\nThe virtuous gain the Dao/Way and many allies—like the contract held within, merging without demand. The unvirtuous lose the Dao/Way and have few allies—even if they forcefully demand clarity from others, who would answer them? *Zhuangzi* despised those who sought to force connections—this is the case.\n\nIf one truly possesses virtue and morality, why would Heaven alone not aid them? The august Heaven favors none, only virtue does it support. Thus it is said: *\"I do not know those who do good, nor those who do evil.\"* Accumulated goodness attracts benevolent qi; accumulated evil attracts malevolent qi. Accumulated goodness summons divine assistance—Heaven’s Dao/Way naturally aids the good.\n\nMaster Li said: The contract is a pledge of trust; *simply* (彻) means to make clear.\nThe virtuous hold their pledges, while the unvirtuous demand only clarity—knowing only to judge by law, yet unaware that such strictness would leave no people. Those who govern through virtue preserve sincerity, aligning with the people’s hearts.\n\nMaster Lü said: The *Classic of Documents* states: *\"The august Heaven is impartial, aiding only virtue.\"* The *I Ching* says: *\"Heaven aids them—auspicious, with no misfortune.\"* Heaven’s Dao/Way never distinguishes between giving or taking; doing good generates benevolent qi, doing evil generates malevolent qi—naturally corresponding.\nFor the supremely virtuous, harmony arises naturally, favoring only the good—why demand contracts or responsibility from others? This is the way of the ancient past.\n\n**Chapter Eighty: Small States, Few People**\nIn small states with few people, let there be weapons numbering in tens and hundreds, yet unused. Let the people value life so deeply that they do not wander far.\n\nMaster Lin said: Small states with few people—like Mencius’ saying that even a hundred *li* of land could be used to gather lords and unify the world. Laozi meant that those who embody the Dao/Way, if granted even a small state and few people, would govern them simply. Let there be *shí-bǎi* (什伯) formations—like today’s neighborhood watches—where each person has usable skills, yet does not seek personal gain. Thus, all act like gentlemen, content in retreat, valuing life so deeply that they do not wander far. The common people fear doing wrong and remain settled in their homes.\n\nMaster He said: Small states with few people are not inferior to vast lands and many subjects. Governing by the Dao/Way means even smallness can illuminate greatness.\n*Shí-bǎi* refers to communal tools—according to a Western Han decree prohibiting officials’ residences from storing *shí* (什, ten) items, Preface Master Yan (颜师古) noted: *\"Five men form a *wǔ* (伍), ten form a *shí*—sharing tools, hence called *shí-wǔ* equipment, or *shí* goods, like today’s military units where ten form a team, sharing supplies and logistics.\"* Ten make a *shí*, a hundred make a *bǎi*—calculable numbers. If the people have *shí-bǎi* tools yet do not use them, there is no need for travel or storage, sparing labor and taxes—this is the ideal of *\"no affairs where there are none.\"*\n\nStates, whether small or vast in Heaven and Earth, thrive with non-action and falter with interference. If the people once fled lightly for their lives, now that they cherish life, none would stray—who would compel them?\n\nMaster Wu said: Ten make a *shí*, a hundred make a *bǎi*—*shí-bǎi* tools are heavy implements shared by many. *\"Unused\"* means no scheming or greed, so heavy tools serve no purpose. *\"Valuing death\"* means treating life as precious and nurturing it. *\"Not wandering far\"* means living and dying in the same place, never relocating. Laozi sought to reverse the decline of the Zhou, restoring the simplicity of antiquity. Since large states with many people are hard to govern, he spoke modestly: if even a small state with few people could be governed thus, the people would have no desire for the outside, content within.\n\nThough there are boats and carriages, they are not used. Though there are armor and weapons, they are not displayed. The people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\n\nTheir food is sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, their customs joyful.\nNeighboring states are close enough to hear the sounds of roosters and dogs, yet the people die of old age without visiting one another.\n\nMaster Lin said: Though there are boats and carriages, they are not used for distant journeys seeking profit. Though there are armor and weapons, they are not displayed for reliance on force to win. Abandoning written contracts, they return to using knotted cords—reverting to primordial simplicity. Sweet food, fine clothing, secure homes, and joyful customs: neighboring states are near, roosters crow and dogs bark, yet the people die of old age without traveling—each self-sufficient, seeking nothing.\n\nMaster He said: Boats and carriages serve desires—now that the people have few desires, what need is there to ride them? Armor and weapons are used for conflict—now that the people have no conflicts, why display them? Knotted cords were used before writing—now to revive them is to return to ancient purity. Sweet food and fine clothing come from tilling and weaving—no hunger, no cold. Secure homes and joyful customs: their movements are slow, their awareness serene, content and at ease. Neighboring states are close, roosters crow and dogs bark, yet none go nor come—seeking nothing from the world, they age and die. This flourishing of ancient customs comes from the ancient sage’s governance.",

      "translated_text": "Master Wu said: This speaks of having myriad tools yet not using them. Boats, carriages, armor, and weapons—none are things a single person can employ alone; these are what is meant by \"myriad tools.\" To have nothing to ride upon, nothing to display—this means they are not used. Without need for travel, there is no use for boats and carriages; without strife, there is no use for armor and weapons. When the people are pure and their affairs simple, even the ancient system of knotted cords could be revived. Though writing replaced knotted cords, it too would not be used.\n\nNot only are myriad tools unused, but the food they eat is deemed sweet, the clothing they wear deemed fine—self-sufficient, nurturing life with what they have. This is what is meant by valuing death. They find contentment in their dwellings and joy in their customs—this is to say they do not migrate far. Those who value death will age and die in the place of their birth; who would lightly abandon it for distant lands?\n\nWhen the people cherish their native soil, even neighboring states—visible to the eye, their roosters crowing and dogs barking audible to the ear—though so near, none go to visit, let alone migrate far.\n\n**Chapter 81**\n*\"True words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not true.\nThe virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\"*\n\nMaster Lü said: Words of truth are plain and unadorned, like water—water is bland yet enduring. What is not beautiful is because its essence is bitter. Beautiful words are sweet and nourishing, pleasing to the ear, like fine wine—yet wine’s sweetness fades quickly. What is untrue is hollow beneath its ornamentation. Hence, *\"True words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not true.\"*\n\nThose who are truly virtuous value action over eloquence, holding to simplicity. Those skilled in argument prize persuasion, entangled in right and wrong, yet lacking true understanding. Hence, *\"The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\"*\n\nThose who grasp the Dao understand principles and penetrate to their roots, seizing the essential—this is to be unified in one, completing all things. Why seek breadth? The broadly learned are versed in things, immersed in affairs, their substance obscured by ornamentation, their minds drowned in multiplicity, seeking only what is right—yet unaware that excess leads to confusion. Hence, *\"The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\"*\n\nMaster Lin said: True words lack adornment; what is adorned is not true. *The Zhuangzi* conceals itself in splendor, taking broad knowledge as skill, boasting of it—this is not the way of the wise.\n\nMaster Li said: *\"True words are not beautiful\"*—loyal words are harsh to hear. *\"Beautiful words are not true\"*—flattering speech is deceitful. True words are plain and unadorned; false words are embellished. Those who truly follow the Dao make no distinctions, hence do not argue. Those skilled in argument are the cause of strife. Hence, the truly wise are luminous yet not dazzling, hence not broadly learned. The broadly learned are superficial in sight, hence lack true knowledge.\n\nThe Sage does not hoard. The more one gives to others, the more one possesses; the more one shares, the more one has. Master Lü said: *The Zhuangzi* speaks of the Dao’s movement without accumulation, thus all under heaven revere it. The Sage’s \"not hoarding\" means spreading virtue for others—those who receive it see their virtue grow ever brighter, like a mirror’s clarity, never diminished. To distribute wealth to the poor: the poor accept the gift, yet the giver’s wealth grows ever fuller, like a wellspring’s clear, unending flow, from which all things draw without depletion. Master Liezi said that giving wealth is the mark of an accomplished person, while sharing virtue is the mark of the Sage—both embody \"not hoarding.\"\n\nBecause there is accumulation, there is lack; because there is no hoarding, there is abundance. Hence, *\"The Sage does not hoard; the more one gives to others, the more one possesses; the more one shares, the more one has.\"*\n\nMaster He said: Why does the Sage not hoard? *The Zhuangzi* says the Dao moves without accumulation, thus all things flourish. The Sage acts without hoarding, thus all under heaven revere them. Hence, *\"Because there is accumulation, there is lack; because there is no hoarding, there is abundance.\"* The Sage’s giving to others only increases their own abundance, sharing with others only multiplies their own wealth—whether through virtue or wealth, demonstrating sincerity, doing good for others, accumulating yet dispersing, broadly learned yet transforming—all embody the intent of making the world public.\n\nMaster Lin said: The Sage’s Dao is but emptiness and unity—what is there to hoard? They never fail to benefit others, yet their own abundance grows ever greater. They never fail to share with others, yet their own wealth multiplies evermore. It is like the Dao of Heaven: empty yet unyielding, moving yet ever producing. To benefit others and be benefited in return, to speak the Dao and transform things—this is the Dao of Heaven.\n\n*\"The Dao of Heaven benefits all without harming.\nThe Sage’s Dao acts without strife.\"*\n\nMaster Lü said: The Dao of Heaven is the Yang—it loves life and abhors killing, hence is beneficial without harm. Spring and summer nurture growth; autumn and winter bring maturation. In its utter impartiality, it fulfills what is good in people yet does not complete what is evil. It gives benefit to all without inflicting harm. Hence, *\"The Dao of Heaven benefits all without harming.\"*\n\nHeaven speaks not yet responds perfectly, always answering with substance, not with empty words. The Sage embodies this as harmony, establishes it as practice, and applies it—thus aligned with Heaven, in accord with the Sage. This is the *\"six penetrations and four openings,\"* the root of all things, yet without strife.\n\nMaster He said: The Dao of Heaven benefits all without harm; the Sage’s Dao accomplishes all without strife.",

Clouds move, rain falls—all things are at peace.**\n\nThe Sage who embodies Qián [the Creative] fulfills the Dao completely and brings beauty to all. With boundless generosity, he aids and rescues the people, accomplishing much yet never striving—all from the wondrous application of the Qián essence.\n\nIn the final chapter of *Lǎozǐ* [Laozi], the first words are removed, then the Sage and the people are discussed, finally aligning with the Dao of Heaven and the Sage.

If one speaks of its benefiting, then harm also becomes apparent. The Sage’s Dao is effortless yet accomplishes all, yet he never relies on his own power—thus he does not contend with things, yet the world cannot contend with him.\n\nThe essence of this text is largely centered on *non-contention*—hence it concludes with these words.\n\n○ **Lǐ Shì** said: The greatest *virtue/power* of Heaven and Earth is *generation*—hence it is said, *\"benefit without harm.\"* The Sage upholds his station with *rén* [benevolence/heart-mind]—hence it is said, *\"accomplish without contention.\"*\n\nIf one practices the principle of *non-contention* in daily life, over time and with purity, one will naturally attain the realm of *Hùn Yuán* [the Primordial Chaos], the *true constant Dao*, and reach its utmost perfection.
