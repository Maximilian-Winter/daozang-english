  "full_translation": "**Treatise on the Heart and Eyes**\n\n*Title:* Treatise on the Heart and Eyes. The author is unknown but is believed to be Wu Jun of the Tang dynasty. The base text is from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Tai Xuan Section.\n\nThe Treatise on the Heart and Eyes\n\nWhat animates man is spirit; what houses him is form. Within the square inch of the breast lies the numinous abode. When still, spirit flourishes and form harmonizes; when restless, spirit labors and form perishes. To deepen the root and settle the utmost—this is how one cultivates nature and feeling.\n\nYet the heart moves the spirit, and the eyes disorder the heart. Nothing strays from truth and severs from the root more than these. Thus, I borrow the heart and eyes to expound this discourse, hoping to dispel stagnation and clarify the spirit.\n\nOne day, the heart, aspiring to non-action, was disturbed by the eyes. It reproached them, saying: \"I wish to forget emotion and withdraw into reclusion, to follow my nature and embrace the subtle and tranquil. I would repose in the realm of Great Harmony, wander the crossroads of the four directions, depart the domain of life and death, and enter the utmost of spirit and illumination. I would ride the primordial chaos into the distant, boundless expanse. Why, when I seek stillness, do you gaze? When I seek purity, do you scheme?\n\nYou survey the myriad forms to muddy my rectitude, delight in beauty to drain my essence. You cast me into the boundless unseen, bask me in fleeting pleasures, sway me upon the spring terrace, grieve me in the autumn fields. You congeal my emotions upon the swallow’s mound, alter my hair at the sight of the vast gate. Gazing toward Chu, I am lost in longing; looking down upon Qi’s outskirts, I weep in attachment. The myriad thoughts that stir my feelings—all are the dizziness of your glance. Though my body craves adornment, my mouth rich flavors, my ears fine sounds, my nose fragrant scents—all that moves me most is your doing. Thus, you are my greatest affliction, the source of my faults. If not your folly, whose enmity is this?\"\n\nThe eyes, indignant, replied: \"Have you not heard that one man governs the realm, and the nine provinces follow his model? Order arises from the upright above; chaos stems from the wayward below. Thus, Yao’s customs could be praised, and Jie’s multitudes could be led. Even distant lands and alien peoples all submit to the imperial norm.\n\nThe heart is the lord of the body, the numinous abode. When it rebels, I am cast aside; when it obeys, I am employed. Fortune is summoned by joy, regret and shame gather by folly. Thus, the ruler of men governs before disorder arises; the preserver of the Dao concentrates the mind before it scatters. How can one wait for the four seas to sunder before quelling rebellion, or for the five passions to overflow before attaining steadfast observation?\n\nWhy not still your mechanism, preserve your subtlety? Instead, you distinguish self from other, illuminate right and wrong, rejoice in glory, grieve in disgrace, exult in excess, lament in want. Like wind lifting into clouds, like stars racing or lightning flashing, you churn and whirl, stirring your desires. Having muddied your truth and confused your spirit, you defy the celestial mind and rebel against the celestial lord. How can you not drown in the Creator’s vistas, lose your way at nature’s ford?\n\nThus, I am sent forth to serve your inclinations. Having contracted this filth, you now blame me. Alas! What fault is mine?\"\n\nThe heart, sighing long, then said to the eyes: \"Consider this: between you and me, who grasps the intent? Why is the division between concealment and revelation so profound, yet the mystery so alike?\n\nSince the myriad things are our affliction, let us now choose our path. Together, let us transcend the turmoil of the dusty world and ascend to the realm of purity and stillness. You shall pluck the dark, inhale the morning light, chew jade blossoms, and sip nectar. Thus, we shall await spiritual transformation into wings, soaring through clouds and mist, ascending to the Three Clarities, leaving the Eight Wastes far below. We shall befriend Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao, aligning with heaven and earth as our constant. What can praise or blame reach? What need is there for acceptance or rejection?\n\nSurely, this is my design. Tell me: do you conceal or reveal?\"\n\nThe eyes said: \"You are closer, yet not yet at the utmost. If so, this is what is called seeking stillness while restlessness follows, renouncing dust only to be tainted by sediment—still far from the use of returning to the root, standing alone in remoteness.\n\nThe essence of the subtle and tranquil is this: rolled up, it has no inside; unfurled, it has no outside. Vast and boundless, dark and without counterpart. To discard this and take that is to gain the small and lose the great, to forget the shade and extinguish the shadow. How can one escape advantage and harm?\n\nWhen the empty chamber gives birth to brightness, it is where the Dao and virtue are borne. To cut off human schemes before they arise is to meet the natural principle of itself.\n\nThus, the Mysterious Origin blunted its sharpness to observe the wondrous; Wenxuan abandoned the heart to employ form. The Yellow Emperor attained it in the formless; Guangcheng grasped it in the profound darkness. Yan Hui sat in forgetfulness to achieve great penetration; Zhuangzi harmonized with heaven to perfect his essence. Surveying the sages to examine virtue, none relied on cunning schemes.\n\nWhen water stills its waves, it becomes clear; when dust ceases to stir, the mirror brightens. Without fleeing the world to soar high, the square inch of the breast finds peace. Thus, one can dwell in tranquil constancy, respond and yet emerge, shine without radiance, be secret without concealment. Darkly uniting beginning and end, who is different? With the myriad things, it is one.\n\nThereby, nothing is gained, and thus nothing is lost. Truly following the level path, one may eternally preserve primordial auspiciousness. But if one abandons the center to pursue the surface, one will stray into the minute and find no obstruction. Why? Water accumulates, and dragons coil; forests flourish, and beasts dwell. Spirit wields the empty and vast; the Dao gathers in the mysterious void. If one does not dissect what one has, how can one attain what one lacks?\n\nUnless one forgets form and stills the mind, polishes flaws and cleanses the mirror, the mysterious gate will not brighten of itself, the hidden latch will not open. How can one cross into freedom from entanglement?\n\nOtherwise, how can one ride the Eight Effulgences, ascend the Nine Heavens, behold the resplendent Golden Towers, tread the vast Purple Courts? How can one share the boundlessness of the kalpa, making ten thousand springs a single morning?\"\n\nThe heart, thereupon, released its myriad cares, settled its hesitation, clarified itself gradually, and employed itself without haste. It thanked the eyes, saying: \"You have blessed me with the good Dao, expanded me with the utmost words, awakened me from the great dream, opened for me the profound mystery, raised me upon the true steps, admitted me through the wondrous gate, set me free in the vast wilderness, and roamed me through the inexhaustible source.\"\n\nNeither bound to the many nor solitary in itself,\nwhy seek stillness or strive for movement?\nHarmonizing with the eternal ease of utmost joy,\nembracing true essence to endure forever—\nto dismiss it is not dismissal,\nto plumb its depths is ever deeper.\nThrough it, one penetrates the Ancestor of creation,\nand reaches the heart of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThus I empty desire to see beyond the blindness of eyes,\nand block vision to perceive within the forest of the dark and yellow.\nI glimpse being yet behold emptiness and quiescence,\nhear the *Shao* music as though listening to the echo of valleys.\nWith Nature I take the lead in song,\nwith desirelessness I make a companion.\nI cease racing after lords and rulers,\npreserving what comes after Heaven can achieve.\nI seal off desire before its signs arise,\nuntangle knots before disturbance begins.\nI forget the vastness of Heaven and Earth,\ndisregard the minuteness of autumn down.\nAbiding in solitude, I hear harmony;\nsubmerged in chaos, I witness dawn.\nResponding to things in their cycles,\nI contain radiance and seal the gate.\nThough whirlwinds shake the sea,\nswift thunder shatters mountains,\nfloods scorch the marshes to the sky—\nI remain at leisure.\nTheir going and staying, speech and silence—\nwhat need is there to ponder between them?\n\nHeart and eyes conclude their discourse.",
