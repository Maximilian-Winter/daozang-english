By attaining emptiness and cultivating tranquility, stilling the mechanism and washing away dust, the Great Dao extends and spreads. Thus, the ancients who guarded the Dao turned away from chariots and crowns, unmoved by their glory, and took no delight in grand chambers or fine delicacies. They stood apart from worldly concerns, roaming freely in the mysteries of the profound. What Dao could not be cultivated? What mystery could not be established?\n\nYet how is it that later generations, though often possessing the integrity of the middling scholar, cling to thoughts of both existence and annihilation—some loving life but failing to cultivate it, others fearing death but neglecting to avoid it? Thus, the calamities of anxiety and peril arrive daily, and unforeseen changes arise without cease. Though they may harbor the intention to refine themselves, they lack the resolve; though they may entertain the thought of transcendence, they hold no hope. How then do they differ from the mediocre masses of the dusty world?\n\nFor this reason, in the present age, those who study the Dao are many, but those who attain it are few. Since I have long regarded this matter with reverence, I shall now raise my voice to admonish them: value purity and sincerity in practice, lest you abandon the path halfway.\n\nThe scripture says: If one wishes to guard the Dao, one must first guard the heart. The heart can be stirred or stilled, can give life or bring death—its depths are unfathomable. Like a monkey racing after deviant pleasures, it is difficult to restrain. Like five thieves stealing the true sovereign, if one does not guard it with the Dao, attainment is far indeed.\n\n*The Scripture of Thorough Penetration* states: The heart belongs to the mysterious sovereign, and the Great Dao accompanies it. Thus, those who guard the Dao must make this their foremost task.\n\nWhen the heart is properly guarded, the mind remains undisturbed, and its governance will surely return to my command. The heart and mind govern both inner and outer, and they must not be lost. Therefore, one should rectify one’s form, restrain desires, moderate conduct, and humble oneself. In movement and stillness, observe propriety, entering the realm of the noble person. In advance and retreat, maintain measure, never transgressing the bounds of the worthy. Then, arrogance and indolence will cease, and one will no longer deceive oneself.\n\nIf this is not so, why did Confucius say that when the body is upright, commands are obeyed without being issued? If even governance relies on this principle, how much more so the cultivation of the Dao? Thus, one must first guard the heart, and then guard the body.\n\nWhen the heart is upright within, the body is upright without, and the eyes must not be allowed to stray. One should reject gaudy splendor and be cautious of sounds and sights. When the five colors are properly aligned, the deviant will not invade one’s eyes. When the five tones are measured, the licentious will not disturb one’s ears. Thus, red and purple cannot usurp vermilion, and the music of Zheng and Wei cannot disrupt elegance. The ears and eyes will receive their proper nourishment, and their true nature will not be led astray.\n\nIf this is not so, why did Boyi refuse to look upon evil colors or listen to lewd sounds? If even a man of Boyi’s purity adhered to this, how much more so the cultivation of the Dao? Thus, the ears and eyes must also be guarded.\n\nHaving secured the eyes and ears in their proper place, one must also be cautious of fragrance and taste. The sweetest perfumes cannot nourish one’s nature; simple fare can suffice to fill one’s belly. When the five flavors arise, guard against their savor. When the five fragrances arise, attain their absence. In vast emptiness and profound stillness, the nose and tongue will no longer be one’s afflictions. Thus, fragrance and taste must also be guarded.\n\nIf this is not so, why did the ancients say that dwelling in stench corrupts the true, and indulging in sweetness ruins the dark? If even the common people of the world observe this, how much more so the cultivation of the Dao? Thus, the nose and tongue must not be indulged.\n\nWhen all these are properly aligned and each is guarded, the six roots will be at peace, and the Great Dao will reside within. Internally, one will not be enslaved by the dark; externally, one will not be disturbed by affairs. Serene upon the mysterious couch, at ease within the wondrous abode, vexations will not trouble the three realms, and thoughts will not disturb the myriad spirits. The elixir may be refined nine times without error, and the true may be arrayed with the seven treasures without confusion. Traversing non-action, one reaches the other shore; crossing merit, one enters the misty clouds. Thus, the six roots returning to the Dao is no small matter—it depends entirely on how one guards them.\n\n*The Six Roots Returning to the Dao* concludes.",
