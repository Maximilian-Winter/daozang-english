(P.87) **Dao Yuan (The Origin of the Dao/Way)**:\nThe Dao/Way is constant from its beginning, harmonizing with the Great Void.\nThe Great Void becomes one, and constancy makes it cease.\nDamp and dreamy, it lacks clarity—no distinction between bright and dim.\nIts essence subtly pervades, its vitality quietly unfolds (does not flourish).\nBefore anything existed, all things had no form.\nBefore anything took shape, the Great Dao/Way was named.\nHeaven could not cover it, Earth could not bear it.\nSmall forms emerge to become small, great forms to become great.\nFilling the realm within the Four Seas, yet still encompassing beyond.\nIn the shade, it does not rot; in the sun, it does not wither.\nWith one measure unchanging, it can adapt to all transformations (rules and movements).\nBirds gain it and fly, fish gain it and swim, beasts gain it and run—\nall things gain it and thrive, all affairs gain it and succeed.\nAll people use it, yet none know its name.\nAll people rely on it, yet none see its form.\nOne is its designation, the Void its dwelling,\nits nature is plain, its application harmonious.\nThus, the Dao/Way of the highest is lofty yet unseen,\nprofound yet unfathomable.\nBright and clear, yet it cannot be named;\nvast and great, yet it cannot be formed.\nStanding alone, yet unpaired—\nno thing can command it.\nHeaven and Earth, yin and yang,\nthe Four Seasons, Sun and Moon,\nstars, clouds, and **qi**—\nall movements and transformations (rules and shifts),\nthose who follow the roots (primordial essence),\nall draw life from it—\nthe Dao/Way does not make some gain less;\nall return to it—\nthe Dao/Way does not make some gain more.\nFirm yet not brittle, yielding yet not corruptible.\nThe subtle cannot reach it, the extreme cannot surpass it.\nThus, only the **sage** can perceive its form,\nlisten to its **sound**.\nKnowing the reality of the Void,\nthey can then attain the Great Void.\nThus, they grasp the essence of Heaven and Earth,\nunite with the harmonious yet remain distinct,\nsurround all yet are never full.\nThose who embody this Dao/Way\nare called **able to refine**.\nThe enlightened can perceive the utmost,\nknow what people cannot know—\npeople embody what they cannot attain.\nThis is called **perceiving the extreme and knowing the utmost**.\n**Sage-kings** who practice this\nmake the world submit.\nIf the highest hate evil,\nthey govern with **rectitude** and the people are not confused.\nIf the highest embrace the Void below and remain tranquil,\nthe Dao/Way finds its proper order.\n**Trust** can desire—\nit can be the people’s command.\nIf the highest trust in governance,\nall things will be universally **rectified**.\nAllot to them their due,\nand the myriad people will not contend.\nGrant them their names,\nand all things will naturally settle.\nThey do not **govern** with coercion,\nnor **relax** with disorder.\nVast and great—\nthey do not **exhaust** its reach.\nProfound and subtle—\nthey do not **seek** to grasp it.\nThus, they hold to the One yet do not transform.\nThe root of attaining the Dao/Way:\nclutching the few to know the many.\nThe key to managing affairs:\ngrasping the proper to rectify the unusual.\nKnowing the Great Ancient Dao/Way beforehand,\nattaining its essence afterward.\nEmbrace the Dao/Way and hold fast to its measure—\nthe world can be unified.\nObserve it in the Great Ancient Dao/Way,\nand you will know its source.\nSeek it in its beginning,\nand you will attain its source.\n\n**Dao Yuan** (The Origin of the Dao/Way) contains **four hundred and sixty-four** characters.\n\nThe *Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (Volume I) – Laozi A Text and Others*: 130.\nThe *Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (Volume I)* Laozi B Text (P.89) **Dharma/Virtue-Power Chapter**:\nThe highest **virtue/power** does not cling to **virtue/power**—\nthus, it has **virtue/power**.\nThe lowest **virtue/power** does not lose **virtue/power**—\nthus, it retains **virtue/power**.\nThe highest **virtue/power** acts yet does not act.\nThe highest **benevolence** acts yet does not act.\nThe highest **virtue/power** (in *Daoist* sense) acts yet has **virtue/power** in its action.\nThe highest **rites** act yet none respond—\nthen they flail their arms and cast it aside.\nThus, after losing the Dao/Way, **virtue/power** arises;\nafter losing **virtue/power**, **benevolence** follows;\nafter losing **benevolence**, **righteousness** follows;\nafter losing **righteousness**, **rites** follow.\n**Rites**, though, are but the **thin veneer** of loyalty and trust,\nand the beginning of chaos.\nKnowledge beforehand is the **flowering** of the Dao/Way,\nand the beginning of folly.\nThus, the **great man** abides in its **thickness** (substance),\nnot in its **thin veneer**,\ndwelling in its reality, not its **flowering**.\nHence, they abandon that and take this.\n\nThe *Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (Volume I) – Laozi A Text and Others*: 131.\nThe *Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (Volume I)* Laozi B Text (P.89) **Dharma/Virtue-Power Chapter**:\nOf old, those who attained the One—\nHeaven gained the One to become clear,\nEarth gained the One to become tranquil,\nthe **spirit** gained the One to become **alive/nimble**,\nthe **valley** gained the One to become full,\nthe **feudal lords and kings** gained the One to govern the world.\nIf they pushed it to its utmost,\nHeaven would fear it might shatter if too clear,\nEarth would fear it might erupt if too tranquil,\nthe **spirit** would fear it might falter if too **alive/nimble**,\nthe **valley** would fear it might dry up if too full,\nthe **feudal lords and kings** would fear their height might topple if too noble.\nThus, they must be noble yet humble as their root,\nhigh yet low as their foundation.\nHence, the **feudal lords and kings** call themselves \"lonely and childless\" (without descendants),\nfor this is their humble root—\nis it not? Thus, the utmost **principle** is **universal** (or \"the utmost number is the vehicle\").\n\nThus, one should not desire wealth that glitters like jade,\nnor rigidity that clings like stone.\n\n---\nThe **noble** who hears the Dao, strives diligently to practice it.\nThe **middle-ranking** who hears the Dao, holds it as if it exists, as if it does not.\nThe **lowly** who hears the Dao, laughs at it.\nHe who does not laugh is not worthy of the Dao.\n\nTherefore, it is said:\nTo manifest the Dao is like obscuring it;\nTo advance the Dao is like retreating from it;\nTo level the Dao is like blending with it.\n\n**Highest virtue** is like the **valley**,\nGreat brightness is like being sullied,\nExtensive virtue is like insufficiency.\nEstablishing virtue is like stealing,\nAuthenticity is like returning to the uncarved block,\nGreat rectitude is like having corners,\nGreat skill is like clumsiness,\nGreat music is like silence,\nGreat art is like the unformed shape,\nThe Dao is nameless.\n\nOnly the Dao can begin well and complete well.\n\n---\n**Returning** is the movement of the Dao.\n**Weakness** is the function of the Dao.\nAll things under Heaven arise from **Being**,\n**Being** arises from **Non-Being**.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to **One**,\n**One** gives birth to **Two**,\n**Two** gives birth to **Three**,\n**Three** gives birth to **all things**.\nAll things bear **yin** while embracing **yang**,\nAnd through **harmonious qi**, they achieve balance.\n\nWhat people most detest\nAre the lonely, childless, and barren—\nYet rulers and lords claim these titles for themselves.\nSome things are gained by giving,\nAnd given by gaining.\n\nWhat people are taught to do,\nThey in turn teach others.\nHe who dares to act without restraint\nWill not meet a natural end—\nI shall take him as my teacher.\n\n---\nThe most **gentle** under Heaven\nOvercomes the most **unyielding** under Heaven.\nWhat emerges from **Being**\nReturns to the **interstices**.\n\nThus, I know the benefit of action.\n\nUnspoken teaching is most beneficial—\nFew under Heaven can attain it.\n\n---\nWhich is more cherished: name or body?\nWhich yields more: body or wealth?\nWhich brings greater harm: gain or loss?\nExcessive love leads to great expenditure,\nExcessive hoarding leads to great loss.\nThus, he who knows sufficiency is not humiliated,\nHe who knows when to stop is not in peril,\nAnd he may endure long.\n\n---\nGreat completion resembles deficiency,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat fullness resembles emptiness,\nYet its use is unfailing.\nGreat straightness resembles crookedness,\nGreat eloquence resembles stammering,\nGreat skill resembles clumsiness,\nGreat abundance resembles scarcity.\n\n**Quiet** overcomes **heat**,\n**Stillness** overcomes **loudness**.\nHe who knows **clarity and tranquility**\nMay govern the world.\n\n---\nWhen the Dao prevails under Heaven,\nSteeds are used for manure.\nWhen the Dao declines,\nWarhorses are bred in the wilds.\n\nNo crime is greater than excessive desire,\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,\nNo fault is deeper than covetousness.\nThus, he who knows sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\n---\nWithout leaving his door,\nHe knows the world.\nWithout peering through the window,\nHe knows the **Way of Heaven**.\nThe farther one goes,\nThe less he knows.\n\nThus, the sage acts without moving,\nKnows without seeing,\nAccomplishes without doing.\n\n---\nThe scholar’s learning increases daily,\nThe Daoist’s understanding diminishes daily.\nDiminish, yet again diminish,\nUntil action is no longer action.\nTo seek to take the world,\nOne must first serve it—\nYet when the time comes to act,\nIt is no longer sufficient to take the world.\n\n---\nThe sage’s heart is ever constant,\nUsing the hearts of a hundred families as his own.\n\nThe good man does good, and the wicked man also does good—\nThus he attains the good.\nThe trustworthy man is trusted, and the untrustworthy man is also trusted—\nThus he attains virtue/power.\n\nThe sage, dwelling in the world, is ever serene,\nWith a unified heart for all under Heaven.\nAll creatures pour their ears and eyes into him—\nYet the sage breathes them all away.\n\nLife enters, death departs.\nOf those who cling to life, thirteen perish;\nOf those who embrace death, thirteen survive—\nYet the people persist in living,\nEver moving toward death’s thirteenfold path.\nWhy so?\nBecause they cling to life.\n\nI have heard that those who hold life firmly\nFear not rhinoceros or tiger on the heights,\nNor arms in battle.\nThe rhinoceros may gore with its horn,\nThe tiger may strike with its claws,\nThe blade may cut—\nYet why?\nBecause they dwell in death’s domain.\n\nThe Dao gives birth, virtue/power nourishes it,\nForm shapes it, and tools are completed.\nThus all things honor the Dao and revere virtue/power.\nThe Dao’s eminence, virtue/power’s worth—\nNone bestow them,\nYet they abide naturally.\n\nThe Dao gives birth, nourishes, grows, matures, shelters, protects, and rears.\nIt gives birth yet does not possess,\nActs yet does not rely,\nGrows yet does not rule—\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue/power.\n\nUnder Heaven there is a beginning—\nThe mother of all things.\nHaving obtained the mother,\nOne knows her children.\nHaving known the children,\nOne returns to guard the mother—\nAnd never meets peril.\nClose the orifices, shut the gates,\nAnd one never labors to the end of life.\nOpen the orifices, attend to affairs,\nAnd one never meets obstacles to the end of life.\nSeeing the small is clarity,\nHolding to softness is strength.\nUsing its brilliance, yet returning to its clarity—\nTo abandon oneself to calamity\nIs called the constant way.\n\nIf I were to walk the Great Dao,\nOnly reverence would I fear.\n\nThe Great Dao is most smooth,\nYet the people love strife.\nMorning rituals are neglected,\nFields lie fallow,\nGranaries are empty;\nThey wear ornate robes,\nBear sharp swords,\nFeast sumptuously while hoarding wealth—\nThis is called *excessive* [corruption].\nExcessive [corruption] is not the Dao.\n\nThose who build well are unshaken,\nThose who embrace well are not cast off.\nTheir descendants continue in sacrifice without ceasing.\n\nCultivate virtue/power in oneself, and its virtue/power becomes true.\nCultivate it in the family, and its virtue/power is abundant.\nCultivate it in the village, and its virtue/power grows strong.\nCultivate it in the state, and its virtue/power becomes flourishing.\nCultivate it in the world, and its virtue/power becomes universal.\n\nObserve oneself to understand the self,\nObserve the family to understand the family,\nObserve the state to understand the state,\nObserve the world to understand the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nThose rich in virtue/power are like the unborn babe.\nScorpions, centipedes, snakes do not sting,\nFierce birds and wild beasts do not clutch—\nTheir bones are weak, their sinews soft, yet their grasp is firm.\nThey do not know the union of male and female yet are aroused—\nThis is the utmost of essence.\nThey wail all day yet do not grow hoarse—\nThis is the utmost of harmony.\nKnowing harmony is called constancy,\nKnowing constancy is called clarity,\nIncreasing life is called auspicious,\nThe will directing qi is called strength.\n\nWhen things reach their peak, they grow old—\nThis is called *not the Dao*.\nNot the Dao brings early decay.\n\nThe wise do not speak; those who speak do not know the Dao.\n\nBlock its openings, close its doors,\nHarmonize its brightness, blend with its dust,\nDull its sharpness and untangle its disputes—\nThis is called *the unity of the mysterious*.\n\nThus it cannot be approached with familiarity,\nNor can it be pushed away with coldness;\nIt cannot be exploited for gain,\nNor can it be harmed by enmity;\nIt cannot be prized for nobility,\nNor can it be belittled for lowliness.\nThus it is held in highest esteem by the world.\n\nHow do I know this is so? By this.\n\nThe world abounds with taboos and prohibitions,\nYet the people grow ever poorer.\nThe people abound with sharp tools,\nYet the state and home grow ever more chaotic.\nWhen clever devices proliferate,\nThe people’s confusion grows thick.\nWhen laws and regulations multiply,\nThieves and bandits abound.\n\nTherefore the words of the *sage* say:\nI act for the people, yet they transform themselves;\nI love stillness, yet the people grow upright;\nI tend to affairs, yet the people grow wealthy;\nI desire yet do not desire, yet the people return to simplicity.\n\nWhen governance is gentle and compassionate,\nThe people are simple and earnest.\nWhen governance is sharp and scrutinizing,\nThe people grow weary and depleted.\nWhere fortune lies hidden, who knows its limits?\nGovernance that is too rigid becomes perverse,\nGoodness that is too excessive becomes unnatural—\nThe people’s bewilderment has long endured.\n\nThus it is square yet not rigid,\nModest yet not mean,\nTrue yet not harsh,\nBright yet not dazzling.\n\nTo govern the people and serve Heaven,\nNothing surpasses *frugality*.\n\nIt is only through *frugality* that one may early serve [Heaven].\n\nEarly service is to say [the accumulation of] **virtue/power**.\n\n[The accumulation of] **virtue/power** that is too heavy cannot be achieved,\nCannot be achieved, then one cannot know its limits.\nCannot know its limits, then one may have a state.\nA state’s foundation, one may endure long.\n\nThis is to say [the attainment of] **deep-rooted and firmly established** Dao,\nThe Way of long life and enduring vision.\n\n---\n*Daoist Classic of the Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (First Part) – Old Master Laozi (Version A and B): 152. Daoist Classic of the Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (First Part) – Laozi Version B, P.91*\n\nTo govern a great state as one cooks a small fish,\nTo establish the Dao/Way under Heaven,\nIts spirits do not become numinous.\nNot because its spirits do not become numinous,\nBut because its numinous spirits do not harm the people.\nNot because its numinous spirits do not harm the people,\nFor even the **sage** does not harm them.\n\nThus, the two do not harm each other,\nHence **virtue/power** returns and exchanges are made.\n\n---\n*Daoist Classic of the Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (First Part) – Old Master Laozi (Version A and B): 153. Daoist Classic of the Mawangdui Han Tomb Silk Texts (First Part) – Laozi Version B, P.91*\n\nA great state is the **lowly** one, the **receptive** (牝) of Heaven and Earth. It is the **gathering place** (交) of all under Heaven. The **receptive** (牝) ever, by its stillness, overcomes the **assertive** (牡).\n\nBecause of its stillness, it is fitting to be lowly. Thus, when a great state is lowly to small states, it takes them; when a small state is lowly to great states, it is taken by them. Hence, sometimes it is lowly and takes, sometimes it is taken while remaining lowly.\n\nThus, the great state does not merely wish to **amass** (并畜) people, and the small state does not merely wish to **submit** (入事) to others. When both attain their desires, the greater should still act lowly.\n\nThe Dao/Way is the **source** (注) of all things, the **treasure** (宝) of the virtuous, and the **refuge** (所保) of the unvirtuous. Fine words can be used to **trade** (市), noble actions can be **added** (加) to others. If people are not virtuous, how could they be **abandoned** (弃)?\n\nTherefore, when establishing the Son of Heaven, appointing the Three Ministers (三卿), even if one has a **shared** (共) jade tablet to precede four horses, it is better than sitting and offering this instead.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao/Way in such esteem? Not to **obtain** what is sought, nor to **avoid** guilt by pardoning.\n\nThus, this Dao/Way is most precious for all under Heaven.\n\n**Action** (為) is **matter** (事) and **flavor** (味). Great or small, many or few—**respond** to resentment with **virtue/power** (德). **Plotting** (图) difficulties is easier than **plotting** greatness, and **plotting** greatness is easier than **plotting** subtleties. The difficulty of governing all under Heaven lies in its ease, and the greatness of governing all under Heaven lies in its subtlety. Therefore, the sage never **plots** greatness, and thus can achieve it.\n\nThe sage finds it difficult to govern, hence he **finally** achieves difficulty.\n\nWhen things are at ease, they are easily maintained; when their signs are not yet apparent, they are easily **planned** (谋); when they are brittle, they are easily **judged** (判); when they are subtle, they are easily **dispersed** (散). Begin **action** (為) when things are not yet formed, and govern when things are not yet in disorder.\n\nA tree with a trunk thick enough to encircle with both arms begins as a **sprout** (毫末). A nine-tiered (九成) tower begins with a **clod of earth** (蔂土). A height of ten thousand feet begins at the **foundation** (足下).\n\nThose who **act** (為) are doomed to **fail** (敗), and those who **grasp** (执) are doomed to **lose** (失). Therefore, the sage **acts** but does not **fail**, **grasps** but does not **lose**.\n\nWhen the people engage in affairs, they are always prone to **fail** upon completion. Therefore it is said:\n\n*\"Be cautious at the **end** (終) as you are at the **beginning** (始), and affairs will be **ruined** (敗).\"*\n\nThus, the sage **desires** what others do not **desire**, and does not value **difficult-to-obtain goods** (难得之货); he **learns** what others do not **learn**, and **repeats** the mistakes of the multitude.\n\nHe can **assist** the natural unfolding of all things, yet does not **dare** to act.\n\nThe ancients who **established** the Dao/Way did not do so to **enlighten** the people, but rather to **delude** them.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern because of their **wisdom** (智). Thus, knowing (以知) a state with **wisdom** is the **ruin** (贼) of the state; knowing (以不知) a state without **wisdom** is the **virtue/power** (德) of the state.\n\nEver knowing these two principles is the **standard** (稽式). Ever knowing the standard is to speak of **mysterious virtue/power** (玄德).\n\n**Mysterious virtue/power** is profound and distant, **contrary** (反) to things, yet **reaches** the **great harmony** (大顺).\n\nThe rivers and seas are able to be the rulers of all the valleys (谷),\nbecause they **are good at yielding** to what is below them (以其善下之也).\nThus, they can be the rulers of all the valleys (谷).\n\nTherefore, the **sages** (圣) who wish to **elevate** the people (欲上民),\nmust **lower their words** to them (必以其言下之);\nthose who wish to **lead** the people (欲先民),\nmust **follow with their bodies** (必以其身后之).\n\nHence, though they **reside above** (居上),\nthe people do not **hold them in contempt** (弗重);\nthough they **stand before** (居前),\nthe people are not **harmed** (弗害).\n\nThe world all **delights in pushing them forward** (乐推) yet does not **weary of them** (弗厌),\nnot because they **contend** (争) with it!\nThus, **heaven and earth** (天下) and all things (莫能) cannot **contend with them** (与争).\n\nTherefore, in a **small state with few people** (小国寡民),\nlet there be **ten thousand** (十百) **tools** (人器) yet **not employ them** (而勿用),\nso that the people **hold death in reverence** (重死) and **avoid migration** (远徙).\n\nThere are **boats and chariots** (周舟车) for their **use** (所乘),\nand **armor and weapons** (甲兵) **displayed** (所陈).\nYet let the people **return to knotting cords** (复结绳) for their **practical needs** (而用之).\n\nLet them **find their food sweet** (甘其食),\n**their clothing fine** (美其服),\n**their customs delightful** (乐其俗),\nand **their dwellings secure** (安其居).\n\nNeighboring states lie in view of one another,\nyet the barking of dogs is all that passes between them—\nthe people grow old and die without ever visiting one another.\n\n**True words are not beautiful**; beautiful words are not true.\nThe wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\nThe virtuous do not hoard; the hoarders are not virtuous.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of the **sage** accumulates—\ngiving to others, yet **virtue/power** only grows;\ntaking from others, yet **virtue/power** only increases.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** of **heaven** benefits without harming;\nthe **Dao/Way** of humanity acts without contending.\n\nThe world **all** calls me great,\ngreat yet not resembling.\nBecause I do not resemble,\nonly then can I be great.\nIf I were to resemble,\nlong ago I would have been insignificant.\n\nI always possess three **treasures**,\nhold them and **treasure** them:\none is **Daoist compassion** (慈),\nthe second is **Daoist frugality** (俭),\nthe third is **not daring to act first under heaven**.\n\n**Daoist compassion** (慈) enables **virtue/power** (勇);\n**Daoist frugality** (俭) enables daring, **therefore** abundance;\n**not daring to act first under heaven** enables completion of the task and **leadership** (成器长).\n\nNow if one abandons **Daoist compassion** (慈) and instead seeks **virtue/power** (勇),\nabandons **Daoist frugality** (俭) and instead seeks abundance,\nabandons **the Way of yielding** (后) and instead acts first,\nthen one will perish.\n\n**Daoist compassion** (慈),\nwhen waging **war** (战), brings **victory** (胜);\nwhen defending, brings **steadfastness** (固).\n**Heaven** will establish it—\nas if **Daoist compassion** (慈) were its **boundary/wall** (垣).\n\nThus, those skilled in **Daoist governance** (为士) are not belligerent;\nthose skilled in **war** (战) do not grow angry;\nthose skilled in **victory** (胜) over enemies do not contend;\nthose skilled in **using people** (用人) place them below themselves.\n\nThis is called **the Way of non-contention** (不争之德).\nThis is called **using people** (用人);\nthis is called **harmonizing with Heaven** (配天),\nthe ultimate standard of antiquity.\n\nWhen wielding arms, there is a saying:\n*\"I dare not take the offensive but only defend,\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"*\n\nThis is called **moving without moving** (行行),\n**brandishing arms** (攘臂),\n**grasping weapons** (执兵),\nyet **not engaging the enemy** (乃敌).\n**Disaster is greatest when facing the enemy** (祸莫大于敌).\nWhen the enemy is near, **my treasure is lost** (亡吾宝矣).\nThus, when armies confront each other in equal strength,\n**the one who laments will prevail** (哀者胜矣).\n\nMy words are easy to know, easy to follow;\nyet the world cannot know them, cannot follow them.\nWords have their **roots** (宗),\naffairs have their **lords** (君).\nOnly because **they do not know** (知),\nthey do not know me.\nThe few who know make me **precious** (贵矣).\nThus, the **Sage** wears coarse cloth while **embracing jade** (被褐怀玉).\n\nTo know what is unknown—\nthis is **exalted** (尚矣).\n\nTo know what one does not know—this is **illness** (病矣).\nThus, the **Sage** does not **suffer** (病) because **they treat illness as illness** (以其病病也), and so they do not suffer.\n\n---\n\nWhen the people do not fear what is **awful** (畏),\nthen **great awe** (大畏) will surely come.\nDo not **despise** (狎) where you dwell,\ndo not **satiate** (厌) what sustains you.\nOnly because they do not **satiate** (厌),\nthey are not **satiated** (厌).\nThus, the **Sage** knows themselves yet does not **boast** (自见),\nloves themselves yet does not **exalt** (自贵).\nTherefore, they abandon that and embrace this.\n\n---\n\nTo dare boldly is to slay,\nto dare not to dare is to **preserve** (活).\nThese two—one brings **benefit**, one brings **harm**.\nWhat the **Heavenly** (天) **abhors** (恶), who knows its reason?\nThe **Way of Heaven**—\nit does not **wage war** (战) yet **excellently conquers** (善胜),\nit does not **speak** (言) yet **excellently responds** (善应),\nit does not **summon** (召) yet **comes of its own accord** (自来),\n**plain** (坦) yet **excellently strategizes** (善谋).\n**Heaven’s net** (网) is **vast** (罔罔),\n**spread wide yet loses none**.\n\n---\n\nIf the people **constantly** do not fear death,\nhow can one **terrify** (惧) them?\nIf one makes the people **constantly** fear death,\nthen those who act **strangely** (奇) [I] **seize and kill** (得而杀之),\nwho then would dare?\nIf the people **constantly** must fear death,\nthen there will always be those who **execute** (司杀者).\nFor those who **replace the executioner** to kill—\nthis is to **replace the master carpenter** to **hew** (斲).\nTo **replace the master carpenter** to hew—\nfew would not **injure their hands**.\n\nWhen the people are hungry,\nit is because their means of taking food are excessive,\nthus they hunger.\n\nWhen the myriad surnames are not governed,\nit is because their rulers take for themselves,\nthus they are not governed.\n\nWhen the people lightly regard death,\nit is because their desire for life is excessive,\nthus they lightly regard death.\n\nHe who constantly takes for himself in life—\nthis is to esteem life as virtue and honor.\n\nThe way of life for man is soft and weak,\nyet in death it is firm and strong.\nThe way of life for all things—grass and wood—\nis soft and brittle,\nyet in death they wither and dry.\n\nThus it is said:\n**\"Firm and strong are the companions of death;\nsoft and weak are the companions of life.\"**\n\nIf one relies on strength in battle, one will not prevail;\nif wood is strong, it will be cracked.\nThus, strength dwells below,\nwhile softness and weakness dwell above.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow:\nthe high it presses down,\nthe low it lifts up,\nthe overabundant it diminishes,\nthe insufficient it supplements.\nThus the Dao/Way of the world is:\nto diminish the overabundant and benefit the insufficient;\nthe Dao/Way of man is:\nto diminish the insufficient and hoard the overabundant.\n\nWho then can hoard the overabundant\nand yet offer it to Heaven?\nOnly those who possess the Dao/Way.\n\nTherefore the Sage acts yet does not hoard,\nachieves yet does not dwell upon it.\nThus it is that he does not wish to be seen as virtuous.\n\nIn the world, nothing is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing can overcome the firm and strong as water does.\nIt is because water has no equal in yielding.\n\nWater’s victory over the hard,\nweakness’s victory over the strong—\nthe world knows this yet cannot emulate it.\n\nTherefore the Sage’s words say:\n\"To bear the reproach of a state,\nthis is called the guardian of its soil and grain.\nTo bear the inauspiciousness of a state,\nthis is called the sovereign of the world.\"\n\nRight speech is like returning to its source.\n*[And]* great harmony with resentment,\nthere must be excess resentment—\nhow can this be considered good?\n\nThus the Sage holds the left [side of] the covenant\nyet does not blame others for it.\nTherefore there is virtue in keeping the covenant,\nvirtue in fulfilling it.\nHeaven’s Dao/Way is close,\nconstantly favoring those of good virtue.\n\nThe Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Dao/Way.\nThe name that can be named is not the constant name.\nThe name is the origin of all things.\nThat which has a name is the mother of all things.\nThus, always desiring to observe its subtlety,\nalways desiring to observe its manifestations.\nBoth arise from the same source, though named differently yet share the same essence.\nMysterious beyond measure, the gateway to all marvels.\n\nWhen all under heaven know beauty as beauty,\nugly is already present.\nWhen all know goodness, evil is already there.\nBeing and non-being produce each other,\ndifficulty and ease define each other,\nlong and short shape each other,\nhigh and low fill each other,\nsound and voice harmonize each other,\nbefore and after follow each other—\nthis is the constant way.\nTherefore the Sage acts without doing,\nteaches without speaking.\nThings arise yet he does not claim them as his own,\nacts yet does not rely on them,\nsucceeds yet does not dwell upon it.\nIt is precisely because he does not dwell upon it\nthat he never loses it.\n\nDo not exalt the virtuous,\nand the people will not compete.\nDo not prize hard-to-obtain goods,\nand the people will not steal.\nDo not display what is desirable,\nand the people will not be confused.\nThus the Sage’s governance:\nempties their minds, fills their bellies,\nweakens their ambitions, strengthens their bones.\nAlways let the people know desire—\nyet if they dare not act against it, governance fails.\n\nThe Dao/Way is boundless,\nyet its use is inexhaustible.\nDeep and vast, it seems the ancestor of all things.\nIt blunts the sharp, untangles the tangled,\nsoftens the bright, harmonizes the dusty.\nProfound and vast, it seems to exist yet not.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nit precedes the Sovereign like an image.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not kind;\nthey treat all things as straw dogs.\nThe Sage is not kind;\nhe treats the people as straw dogs.\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nwhat is their likeness?\nEmpty yet not bent,\nmoving yet ever more abundant.\nMuch hearing leads to exhaustion;\nbetter to guard the inner essence.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao/Way of the Mysterious Feminine never dies—\nit is called the *Dark Mother*.\nThe gate of the Dark Mother—\nthat is the root of Heaven and Earth.\nIts breath seems to exist—\nuse it without exhaustion.\n\nHeaven endures, Earth persists.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth endure so long\nis that they do not act for themselves—\nthus they endure forever.\nTherefore, the Sage withdraws his self, yet leads;\nsets himself aside, yet stands foremost;\ndoes not cling to his own—\nthus his own is fulfilled.\n\nThe highest virtue is like water.\n\nWater excels in benefiting all things yet does not contend—\nit dwells where people despise.\nThus it nears the Dao/Way.\n\nDwelling, it chooses the lowly ground;\nits heart, the depths;\nits giving, the natural;\nits speech, truthfulness;\nits governance, skillful order;\nits actions, timely;\nits movement, measured.\nOnly by not contending does it attain its superiority.\n\n---\nTo hold and fill is not as good as stopping in time.\nTo grasp and clutch is not as good as enduring.\nGold and jade filling the halls—\nnone can guard them.\nWealth and arrogance bring ruin.\nTo complete a task and withdraw—\nthis is the Dao/Way of Heaven.\n\nTo wear the vital essence and embrace unity—\ncan one not remain undivided?\nTo gather qi into supreme softness—\ncan one not return to infantile purity?\nTo polish the Mysterious Mirror—\ncan one not be without blemish?\nTo love the people and nourish the state—\ncan one not act without knowing?\nTo open and close the Heavenly Gate—\ncan one not be receptive?\nTo be clear and all-encompassing—\ncan one not act without knowing?\nTo give birth and nurture—\nto give birth yet not possess,\nto grow yet not control—\nthis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nThirty spokes converge at a single hub,\nyet it is the emptiness that gives the wheel its use.\nMold clay into vessels,\nyet it is the emptiness that gives them their use.\nCarve doors and windows,\nyet it is the emptiness that gives the room its use.\nThus, what is filled is used for advantage,\nwhat is empty is used for function.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nhunting in the wild drives the heart to madness,\nrare treasures hinder one’s conduct.\nThe five tastes dull the palate,\nthe five tones deaf the ears.\nTherefore, the **sage** in governing does\nwhat benefits the body, not what pleases the eyes.\nThus, he discards that and takes this.\n\nTo cherish and be humiliated as if struck by fear—\nhow is this called cherishing and being humiliated as if struck by fear?\nCherishing is a lowly thing;\nto gain it is like being struck by fear,\nto lose it is like being struck by fear—\nthis is called cherishing and being humiliated as if struck by fear.\n\nHow is this called valuing great calamity as if it were the body?\nIt is because of my body that I have great calamity.\nWhen I have no body,\nwhat calamity can there be?\nTherefore, to value the body above all else in the world,\none can **entrust** the world;\nto love the body above all else in the world,\none can **rely upon** the world.\n\nLook at it yet cannot see—\nthis is called **subtle**.\nListen to it yet cannot hear—\nthis is called **rare**.\nGrasp at it yet cannot attain—\nthis is called **plain**.\nThese three cannot be defined by reasoning,\nso I blend them into one.\nOne: its highest aspect is not erroneous,\nits lowest aspect is not slighted.\n\nSeeking and inquiring cannot be named—\nit returns to the **essence**.\nThis is called **the form of forms**,\n**the image of images**.\nThis is called **the dim and hazy**.\nFollow it and you do not see its back,\nmeet it and you do not see its head.\nHold to the **Dao/Way** of today\nto govern the **possessions** of today.\nTo know the ancient beginnings—\nthis is called **the record of the Dao/Way**.\n\nThe ancients who **practiced the Dao/Way**—\ntheir **subtle** and **mysterious** virtue was profound and far-reaching,\ndeep and beyond comprehension.\nBecause it was beyond comprehension,\nthey strenuously described it as follows:\nLike crossing water in winter, cautious and alert,\nlike fearing on all sides, wary and watchful,\nlike treating a guest with reverence, solemn and respectful,\nlike melting ice, clear and dissolving,\nlike returning to simplicity, pure and unadorned,\nlike settling mud, still and turbid,\nlike flowing in valleys, muddy yet yielding.\nTurbid yet still, it gradually clears.\nDisturbed yet settled, it gradually comes to life.\nTo preserve this **Dao/Way**\nis to never seek fullness—\nthus one can be **worn out** yet never complete.\n\nWhen **emptiness** reaches its utmost,\none guards **stillness** with vigilance.\nAll things arise together,\nand I observe their return.\nThe **vital essences** of Heaven and Earth\neach return to their own roots.\nThis is called **stillness**.\n**Stillness** is called **returning to the vital essence**.\nReturning to the vital essence is called **constancy**.\nKnowing **constancy** is called **clarity**.\nNot knowing **constancy** is **recklessness**,\nand **recklessness** brings disaster.\nKnowing **constancy**, one is **tolerant**—\n**tolerance** becomes **impartiality**,\n**impartiality** becomes **kingly**,\n**kingly** becomes **heavenly**,\n**heavenly** becomes **Dao/Way**,\n**Dao/Way** becomes **itself**.\nThus, one’s life is never in peril.\n\nThe greatest is known yet has **possessions**;\nthe next is loved for its reputation;\nthe next is feared;\nthe lowest is despised.\nTrust is insufficient,\nand without trust there is no trustworthiness.\nIt is like valuing words.\nWhen tasks are accomplished,\nthe people say, “It happened naturally.”\n\nTherefore, when the **Great Dao/Way** is abandoned,\nwhere do **virtue/power** and **benevolence/rightness** arise?\nWhen **wisdom** emerges,\nwhere does **great deception** arise?\nWhen the six relationships are discordant,\nwhere do **filial piety** and **compassion** arise?\n\nWhen a state is in **turmoil and confusion**,\nwhere do **loyal ministers** arise?\n\nThus, when the **Sage** abandons **wisdom**,\nthe people benefit a hundredfold.\nWhen **virtue/power** and **benevolence/rightness** are discarded,\nthe people return to **filial piety** and **compassion**.\nWhen **artifice** and **profit** are forsaken,\nthe **lowly** are held in esteem.\nThese three principles—\nthough insufficient as doctrine—\nare thus made to have their place.\n\nSeeing **unadorned simplicity** and embracing **primordial purity**,\nwith few **private desires** and scant **cravings**.\n\nAbandon **learning** and **worry**.\n\nHow far apart are **approval** and **reproach**?\nHow different are **beauty** and **evil**?\nThat which people **fear**,\none must also not fail to **fear**.\n\nDazed and bewildered—\nhow vast and boundless it is!\nThe multitude **revels**,\nfeasting as if at a grand banquet,\nascending platforms in spring.\n\nI alone am **serene and unassuming**,\nlike an infant before it cries.\nLayered and obscured—\nit seems to have a destination.\n\nThe multitude all have **excess**,\nwhile my **simple-hearted** mind\nis **pure and uncluttered**.\n\nThe **common folk** are **bright and clear**,\nyet I alone seem **confused**.\nThe **common folk** are **sharp and discerning**,\nyet I alone am **grieving and sorrowful**.\n\nFloating like the sea,\ndazed as if at rest.\nThe multitude all have **some means**,\nwhile I alone am **obstinate and coarse**.\n\nI wish to differ from others,\nyet **revere the nourishing Mother**.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the **Great One**—\nonly the **Dao/Way** follows it.\nThe **Dao/Way’s** essence—\nonly **dazed** and **boundless**.\nBoundless and dazed—\nwithin it lies **form**.\nDazed and boundless—\nwithin it lies **substance**.\n**Profound** and **obscure**—\nwithin it lies **essence**.\nIts essence is **most true**,\nwithin it lies **trust**.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nits name does not fade—\nit conforms to the **Great Parent**.\n\nHow do I know the **Great Parent** is so?\nThus.\n\nThe **cook** does not stand.\n\nHe who **shows himself** does not **shine**,\nhe who **praises himself** is not **clear**.\n\nHe who **boasts of his own merits** achieves **virtue/power**,\nyet he who **vaunts himself** does not **endure**.\n\nIn the **Dao/Way**, it is said:\n*\"**Excessive food**, **superfluous actions**.\"*\n\nSome may **despise** this,\nso those with **desires** do not **abide** by it.\n\n**Flexible** is **whole**,\n**crooked** is **straight**,\n**lowly** is **filled**,\n**worn** is **renewed**.\n\n**Few** is **gain**,\n**many** is **confusion**.\n\nThus, the **sage** holds to **One**,\nto **shepherd** the world.\n\nHe does not **show himself**, so he **shines**,\nhe does not **praise himself**, so he is **clear**.\nHe does not **boast of his own merits**, so he has **virtue/power**,\nhe does not **vaunt himself**, so he can **endure**.\n\nOnly he who does not **contend**,\ncan **none** **contend** with him.\n\nOf old, those who spoke of **\"**Flexible** is **whole**\"**—how few their words were!\nIndeed, **whole** returns to it.\n\n**Hopeful speech** comes from **naturalness**.\n\n「轻风不终朝，暴雨不终日。\n孰为此？天地，而弗能久，又况于人乎？\n故从事而道者同于道，得者同于德，失者同于失。\n同于德者，道亦得之；同于失者，道亦失之。\n\n有物混成，先天地生。\n寂寥独立，不改，可以为天下母。\n吾未知其名，字之曰**Dao/Way**。\n吾强为之名曰大。\n大曰**逝**，逝曰远，远曰反。\n**Dao/Way**大，天大，地大，王亦大。\n天下有四大，而王居一焉。\n人法地，地法天，天法**Dao/Way**，**Dao/Way**法自然。\n\n重为轻根，静为躁君。\n是以君子终日行，不远其辎重，虽有环馆，燕处则昭若。\n若何万乘之王而以身轻于天下？\n轻则失本，躁则失君。\n\n善行者达，善言者谪，善数者不用筹策。\n善闭者关钥而不可启，善结者约而不可解。\n是以圣人恒善救人，而弃人，物弃财，是谓曳明。\n故善人，善人之师；不善人，善人之资也。\n不贵其师，不爱其资，虽智大迷。\n是谓妙要。\n\n知其雄，守其雌，为天下谷。\n为天下谷，恒德乃足。\n恒德乃足，复归于朴。\n知其白，守其黑，为天下式。\n为天下式，恒德不忒。\n恒德不忒，复归于极。\n朴散则为器，圣人用则为官长。\n夫大制割。\n\n将欲取天下而为之，吾见其弗得已。\n夫天下，神器也，非可为者也。\n为之者败之，执之者失之。\n物或行或随，或热或寒，或培或堕。\n是以圣人去甚，去大，去奢。\n\n以**Dao/Way**佐人主，不以兵强于天下。\n其事好还，师之所处，荆棘生之。\n善者果而已矣，毋以取强焉。\n果而勿骄，果而勿矜，果而勿伐，果而勿得已居，是谓果而强。\n物壮而老，谓之不**Dao/Way**，不**Dao/Way**早已。」\n\nWeapons are an inauspicious instrument.\nMen may detest them, yet those with desires cannot refrain from wielding them.\n\nThe noble man, when at rest, honors the left;\nwhen wielding arms, honors the right.\nThus, weapons are not the instrument of the noble man.\n\nWeapons are an inauspicious instrument—\nwhen used, sharpness is paramount, not adornment.\nTo adorn them is to delight in killing.\nHe who delights in killing cannot prevail in the world.\n\nTherefore, for joyous rites, the left is honored;\nfor funeral rites, the right is honored.\nThus, the general of the left wing takes his place on the left,\nwhile the general of the right wing takes his place on the right—\nthis is to treat them with funeral rites.\n\nWhen many are slain, establish them with sorrowful mourning;\nwhen victorious, treat them with funeral rites.\n\nThe Dao/Way is nameless,\nyet when simplicity is small, the world dares not serve it.\n\nIf lords and kings can guard it,\nall things will willingly submit themselves.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nand all things flourish with sweet dew.\n\nThe people do not command it,\nyet they naturally align themselves.\n\nOnce institutions are established, names are given;\nwhen names are given, one must know when to stop—\nto know when to stop is to avoid ruin.\n\nCompare the Dao/Way in the world\nto a tiny valley among great rivers and seas.\n\nThe noble man, when he can make all things submit yet does not lord over them,\nis ever desiring, and thus may be called *small*.\nWhen he makes all things submit yet does not lord over them,\nhe may be called *great*.\nThus, the sage’s ability to accomplish greatness\nlies in his not claiming greatness,\nand so he can accomplish greatness.\n\nHold to the great image,\nand the world will follow.\nFollow without harm,\nand the world will be at peace and great.\n\nJoy and indulgence—\nwhen guests depart, they are stopped.\n\nThus, when the Dao/Way speaks,\nit says:\n*\"Its taste is subtle,\nyet not visible when seen.\nIts sound is faint,\nyet not heard when listened to.\nIts use is inexhaustible.\"*\n\nWhen you wish to gather it,\nyou must first let it disperse.\nWhen you wish to weaken it,\nyou must first let it grow strong.\nWhen you wish to take it away,\nyou must first give it.\nWhen you wish to seize it,\nyou must first yield it.\nThis is called *subtle efficacy*.\n\nThe soft overcomes the strong.\nThe fish cannot escape the deep,\nnor the sharpest tools reveal their danger to the world.\n\nThe Dao/Way is nameless;\nif lords and kings can guard it,\nall things will naturally transform.\n\nWhen transformed yet inclined to act,\nI will restrain them with the simplicity of its name.\nRestrained by the simplicity of its name,\nthey will not be humiliated.\nNot humiliated, they will remain tranquil,\nand Heaven and Earth will naturally restore themselves.\n\n*Dao/Way* in **246** words.",

Book (P.87) **Dao Yuan (The Origin of the Dao/Way)**:\nThe Dao/Way is constant from its beginning, harmonizing with the Great Void.\nThe Great Void becomes one, and constancy makes it cease.\nDamp and dreamy, it lacks clarity—no distinction between bright and dim.\nIts essence subtly pervades, its vitality quietly unfolds (does not flourish).\nBefore anything existed, all things had no form.\nBefore anything took shape, the Great Dao/Way was named.\nHeaven could not cover it, Earth could not bear it.\nSmall forms emerge to become small, great forms to become great.\nFilling the realm within the Four Seas, yet still encompassing beyond.\nIn the shade, it does not rot; in the sun, it does not wither.\nWith one measure unchanging, it can adapt to all transformations (rules and movements).\nBirds gain it and fly, fish gain it and swim, beasts gain it and run—\nall things gain it and thrive, all affairs gain it and succeed.\nAll people use it, yet none know its name.\nAll people rely on it, yet none see its form.\nOne is its designation, the Void its dwelling,\nits nature is plain, its application harmonious.\nThus, the Dao/Way of the highest is lofty yet unseen,\nprofound yet unfathomable.\nBright and clear, yet it cannot be named;\nvast and great, yet it cannot be formed.\nStanding alone, yet unpaired—\nno thing can command it.\nHeaven and Earth, yin and yang,\nthe Four Seasons, Sun and Moon,\nstars, clouds, and **qi**—\nall movements and transformations (rules and shifts),\nthose who follow the roots (primordial essence),\nall draw life from it—\nthe Dao/Way does not make some gain less;\nall return to it—\nthe Dao/Way does not make some gain more.\nFirm yet not brittle, yielding yet not corruptible.\nThe subtle cannot reach it, the extreme cannot surpass it.\nThus, only the **sage** can perceive its form,\nlisten to its **sound**.\nKnowing the reality of the Void,\nthey can then attain the Great Void.\nThus, they grasp the essence of Heaven and Earth,\nunite with the harmonious yet remain distinct,\nsurround all yet are never full.\nThose who embody this Dao/Way\nare called **able to refine**.\nThe enlightened can perceive the utmost,\nknow what people cannot know—\npeople embody what they cannot attain.\nThis is called **perceiving the extreme and knowing the utmost**.\n**Sage-kings** who practice this\nmake the world submit.\nIf the highest hate evil,\nthey govern with **rectitude** and the people are not confused.\nIf the highest embrace the Void below and remain tranquil,\nthe Dao/Way finds its proper order.\n**Trust** can desire—\nit can be the people’s command.\nIf the highest trust in governance,\nall things will be universally **rectified**.\nAllot to them their due,\nand the myriad people will not contend.\nGrant them their names,\nand all things will naturally settle.\nThey do not **govern** with coercion,\nnor **relax** with disorder.\nVast and great—\nthey do not **exhaust** its reach.\nProfound and subtle—\nthey do not **seek** to grasp it.\nThus, they hold to the One yet do not transform.\nThe root of attaining the Dao/Way:\nclutching the few to know the many.\nThe key to managing affairs:\ngrasping the proper to rectify the unusual.\nKnowing the Great Ancient Dao/Way beforehand,\nattaining its essence afterward.\nEmbrace the Dao/Way and hold fast to its measure—\nthe world can be unified.\nObserve it in the Great Ancient Dao/Way,\nand you will know its source.\nSeek it in its beginning,\nand you will attain its source.\n\n**Dao Yuan** (The Origin of the Dao/Way)

*Daoist* sense) acts yet has **virtue/power** in its action.\nThe highest **rites** act yet none respond—\nthen they flail their arms and cast it aside.\nThus, after losing the Dao/Way, **virtue/power** arises;\nafter losing **virtue/power**, **benevolence** follows;\nafter losing **benevolence**, **righteousness** follows;\nafter losing **righteousness**, **rites** follow.\n**Rites**, though, are but the **thin veneer** of loyalty and trust,\nand the beginning of chaos.\nKnowledge beforehand is the **flowering** of the Dao/Way,\nand the beginning of

attained the One—\nHeaven gained the One to become clear,\nEarth gained the One to become tranquil,\nthe **spirit** gained the One to become **alive/nimble**,\nthe **valley** gained the One to become full,\nthe **feudal lords and kings** gained the One to govern the world.\nIf they pushed it to its utmost,\nHeaven would fear it might shatter if too clear,\nEarth would fear it might erupt if too tranquil,\nthe **spirit** would fear it might falter if too **alive/nimble**,\nthe **valley** would fear it might dry up if too full,\nthe **feudal lords and kings** would fear their height might topple if too noble.\nThus, they must be noble yet humble as their root,\nhigh yet low as their foundation.\nHence, the **feudal lords and kings** call themselves \"lonely and childless\" (without

      "translated_text": "A great state is the **lowly** one, the **receptive** (牝) of Heaven and Earth. It is the **gathering place** (交) of all under Heaven. The **receptive** (牝) ever, by its stillness, overcomes the **assertive** (牡).\n\nBecause of its stillness, it is fitting to be lowly. Thus, when a great state is lowly to small states, it takes them; when a small state is lowly to great states, it is taken by them. Hence, sometimes it is lowly and takes, sometimes it is taken while remaining lowly.\n\nThus, the great state does not merely wish to **amass** (并畜) people, and the small state does not merely wish to **submit** (入事) to others. When both attain their desires, the greater should still act lowly.\n\nThe Dao/Way is the **source** (注) of all things, the **treasure** (宝) of the virtuous, and the **refuge** (所保) of the unvirtuous. Fine words can be used to **trade** (市), noble actions can be **added** (加) to others. If people are not virtuous, how could they be **abandoned** (弃)?\n\nTherefore, when establishing the Son of Heaven, appointing the Three Ministers (三卿), even if one has a **shared** (共) jade tablet to precede four horses, it is better than sitting and offering this instead.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao/Way in such esteem? Not to **obtain** what is sought, nor to **avoid** guilt by pardoning.\n\nThus, this Dao/Way is most precious for all under Heaven.\n\n**Action** (為) is **matter** (事) and **flavor** (味). Great or small, many or few—**respond** to resentment with **virtue/power** (德). **Plotting** (图) difficulties is easier than **plotting** greatness, and **plotting** greatness is easier than **plotting** subtleties. The difficulty of governing all under Heaven lies in its ease, and the greatness of governing all under Heaven lies in its subtlety. Therefore, the sage never **plots** greatness, and thus can achieve it.\n\nThe sage finds it difficult to govern, hence he **finally** achieves difficulty.\n\nWhen things are at ease, they are easily maintained; when their signs are not yet apparent, they are easily **planned** (谋); when they are brittle, they are easily **judged** (判); when they are subtle, they are easily **dispersed** (散). Begin **action** (為) when things are not yet formed, and govern when things are not yet in disorder.\n\nA tree with a trunk thick enough to encircle with both arms begins as a **sprout** (毫末). A nine-tiered (九成) tower begins with a **clod of earth** (蔂土). A height of ten thousand feet begins at the **foundation** (足下).\n\nThose who **act** (為) are doomed to **fail** (敗), and those who **grasp** (执) are doomed to **lose** (失). Therefore, the sage **acts** but does not **fail**, **grasps** but does not **lose**.\n\nWhen the people engage in affairs, they are always prone to **fail** upon completion. Therefore it is said:\n\n*\"Be cautious at the **end** (終) as you are at the **beginning** (始), and affairs will be **ruined** (敗).\"*\n\nThus, the sage **desires** what others do not **desire**, and does not value **difficult-to-obtain goods** (难得之货); he **learns** what others do not **learn**, and **repeats** the mistakes of the multitude.\n\nHe can **assist** the natural unfolding of all things, yet does not **dare** to act.\n\nThe ancients who **established** the Dao/Way did not do so to **enlighten** the people, but rather to **delude** them.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern because of their **wisdom** (智). Thus, knowing (以知) a state with **wisdom** is the **ruin** (贼) of the state; knowing (以不知) a state without **wisdom** is the **virtue/power** (德) of the state.\n\nEver knowing these two principles is the **standard** (稽式). Ever knowing the standard is to speak of **mysterious virtue/power** (玄德).\n\n**Mysterious virtue/power** is profound and distant, **contrary** (反) to things, yet **reaches** the **great harmony** (大顺).",
