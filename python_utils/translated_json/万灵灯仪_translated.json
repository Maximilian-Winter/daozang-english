One fascicle.\n*Source Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Weiyi* Category.\n\n**Rite of the Myriad Spirits Lamp**\n*Proceedings Conducted According to Ritual Form*\n\nWe humbly declare: Between Heaven and Earth, none is more numinous than humanity.\nThe Way of uprightness—none is more sagely than the spirits.\nAble to be numinous, able to be sagely, they are worthy of reverence and veneration.\nSome emerge from darkness into obscurity; some ascend on high or descend below.\nAll receive the virtue of molding and transformation—who knows the source of their workings?\nThose who bestow blessings upon the people establish illustrious names and receive sacrifices;\nThose who render service to the state are granted honorific titles and temples are erected.\nManifestly, this principle is no falsehood;\nProfoundly, its words are difficult to recount.\n\nWe reverently recall [Name of Spirit], whose majestic form is resplendent, whose numinous power blazes forth.\nGuardian of the state, savior of the people, benefactor of all beings.\nResponsive to all prayers, unobstructed in every supplication.\nRevered across the Four Seas, worshipped by all living things.\nEverywhere, temples are built and shrines established; in every household, images are painted and forms depicted.\nWith devotion, we take refuge; with sincerity, we make offerings.\n\nToday, [Name of Person] respectfully follows the ritual regulations, establishing the altar.\nPurifying and preparing incense and lamps, we invite the divine chariot to descend.\nWe humbly pray that the great creation may bestow its radiance, and vast grace may descend in response.\nAccept this earnest offering, and witness these auspicious signs of virtuous action.\nWe bow our heads in reverence, chanting with devotion:\n\n*\"We, your servants, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in [Name of Spirit].\"*\n\nWe humbly consider: The Way of the divine spirits is approachable only through virtue.\nFortune and misfortune arise from the people’s own deeds.\nThough boundless compassion is responsive, the workings of creation are impartial.\nYet rewards and punishments are ever just, and transformation is never withheld.\nIf one awakens to faults and errors, may grace and protection be restored.\n\nToday, [Name of Person] purifies heart and mind, turning toward the Dao and returning to the True.\nPreparing the lamp rite with devotion, we take refuge in [Name of Spirit].\nWe humbly pray for compassion, kindness, and harmonious virtue.\nThrough scorching summers and freezing winters, may afflictions of harm and oppression be dispelled;\nMay we dwell in peace and joy, and receive the utmost blessings of good fortune.\nWe bow our heads in reverence, chanting with devotion:\n\n*\"The Way of the divine spirits, revered through the ages.\nMajestic and awe-inspiring, no wish goes unfulfilled.\nAssisting Heaven and Earth, transforming and soaring through the skies.\nWith wholehearted devotion, all prayers are answered.\nDispelling disaster, bestowing fortune, bringing peace to people and homes.\nWith one heart, we take refuge, wishing for eternal life.\"*\n\n*\"We, your servants, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in [Name of Spirit].\"*\n\nWe humbly consider: Assisting the numinous and upholding harmony, they receive sacrifices from all directions;\nEstablishing virtue and merit, they are enfeoffed as lords across ten thousand leagues.\nEver upholding loyalty to protect the state, ever executing punishments to instruct the people.\nMajestically enthroned in the temple, solemnly revered in the ancestral hall.\nMay manifold blessings return, and their merits flourish.\nToday, [Name of Person], indebted to your sheltering grace, looks up to your profound favor.\nPurifying the dwelling, preparing incense and lamps with devotion, we take refuge in [Name of Spirit].\nWe humbly pray that your fame resound throughout the cosmos, spreading the benevolence of life and nurture;\nThat your might guard the state, expanding the radiant virtue of illumination.\nEver benevolently saving people without abandon, extending perfect kindness to all things without exception.\nProtecting the state and family with prosperity, bringing supreme fortune to homes and courtyards.\nWe bow our heads in reverence, chanting with devotion:\n\n*\"Spreading merit and virtue, establishing transformations for the benefit of people.\nIn manifold expedient ways, majestically enthroned in the temple.\nGuarding the people with the Dao, manifesting numinous power in governing the world.\nDispelling disaster, bestowing fortune, bringing peace to households and families.\"*\n\n*\"We, your servants, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in [Name of Spirit].\"*\n\nWe humbly consider: Dwelling in the Yellow Path, we turn our hearts in sincerity to take refuge;\nThe divine perceives our crimson devotion, radiating numinous light to illuminate.\nPerfect kindness delights in life, extending life and delivering from distress;\nGreat compassion pities suffering, dispersing calamity and dissolving disaster.\nToday, [Name of Person] reverently follows the Daoist canon, respectfully adhering to the immortal’s regulations.\nPreparing the rite of incense and lamp offerings, displaying the majestic image of the divine sage, we take refuge in [Name of Spirit].\nWe humbly pray that the divine spirits universally bestow salvation, and Heaven’s virtue be evenly distributed.\nManifesting a heart of compassion and beneficence, granting the blessings of longevity and well-being.\nWe bow our heads in reverence, chanting with devotion:\n\n*\"Divine and sagely, martial and civil.\nMerits resplendent, governing fate and truth.\nBringing fortune to the people, delivering from distress and misfortune.\nGrace pervading homes and courtyards, virtue universally bestowed.\nSolemnly reverent, like an echo responding to a valley.\nDispelling disaster, bestowing fortune, extending goodness to households.\"*\n\n*\"We, your servants, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in [Name of Spirit].\"*\n\nWe humbly consider: Enthroned on high in Heaven’s position, the divine heart responds with kindness.\nEntrusted with authority over the earth below, commanded by Heaven above.\nAll prayers and supplications are surely granted response.\nLooking up to the benevolence of sheltering and sustaining, we receive the vast gift of boundless grace.\nToday, [Name of Person] prostrates with utmost reverence, taking refuge with wholehearted devotion.\nPreparing pure offerings, arranging incense and lamps, we take refuge in [Name of Spirit].\nWe humbly pray that virtue pervade without limit, and grace extend without end.\nProtecting and preserving great abundance, sheltering all living beings.\nSecuring blessings and longevity in flourishing prosperity, perpetuating the foundation of fortune.\nWe bow our heads in reverence, chanting with devotion:\n\n*\"Wise and upright, divine and sagely in majesty.\nAssisting Heaven’s mandate above, vanquishing demons below.\nSheltering all beings, magnifying meritorious deeds.\nAll prayers answered, boundless virtue.\nDispelling disaster, bestowing fortune, grace extending to the people.\"*\n\n*\"We, your servants, with wholehearted devotion, take refuge in [Name of Spirit].\"*\n\nWe humbly consider: Heaven gives birth to the myriad things, accomplishing the work of nurturing and growth;\nThe hundred affairs of human life all rely on the protection of the divine.\nEvery attainment of warmth and sustenance for the body arises from the molding of the many sages.\nDeeply moved by profound grace, we should receive abundant blessings.\nThus, with reverent devotion, we invoke the august majesty of the sagely.\nHumbly revealing our sincere hearts, we repay our long-held gratitude.\nToday, [Name of Person] respectfully follows the ritual form, preparing incense and lamps, taking refuge in the host of spirits.\nWe humbly pray that divine power silently assist, and sagely grace widely bestow.\nThrough the four seasons, protect the household with purity and fortune;\nEach year, bring peace and well-being to the old and young.\n\nMay official rank and longevity ever ascend, may the sprouts of goodness grow ever lush.\nWith bowed heads we take refuge, in reverent devotion we chant praises:\nMost divine, most sagely, of virtue alone, of fragrance alone.\nAbove, you receive the Mandate of the Emperor; below, you guard and protect the myriad people.\nRepelling evil and establishing right, you deliver and succor all living beings.\nThrough the four seasons, you follow the proper measures, thus ensuring timely abundance.\nDispelling calamities and bestowing blessings, within and without are made equal.\n\nRecitation of sutras—hitherto—dedication.\nThe Rite of the Ten Thousand Spirits’ Lamps is now complete.",
