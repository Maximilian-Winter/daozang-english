  "full_translation": "**Preface to the *Four Hundred Characters on Golden Elixir* with Annotations by Lü Xīxīng**\n*Composed by Zhang Zǐyáng Zhēnrén of Song Tiāntái, Annotated by Lü Xīxīng of the Ming*\n\nThe **Seven Refunds and Nine Returns Golden Elixir**—seven denotes the number of fire, nine the number of metal.\nTo refine metal with fire, returning to the origin and restoring the essence, is called **Golden Elixir**.\nDivide the body and mind into upper and lower strings,\nDistinguish the spirit-*qi* at the winter and summer solstices,\nAlign the form and spirit with the **Kàn-Lí** (water-fire) hexagrams.\nGather the five phases:\nEast—**arcanum** (hún, soul) of wood,\nWest—**pò** (corporeal essence) of metal,\nSouth—**shén** (spirit) of fire,\nNorth—**jīng** (essence) of water,\nCenter—**yì** (intent) of earth.\nThus, the five phases converge.\n\nTo **contain the luminous gaze**, **condense the resonant breath**,\n**harmonize the nasal breath**, **seal the tongue’s *qi***—\nthis is the **unification of the four symbols**.\n\nWhen the eyes do not see yet the *arcanum* abides in the liver,\nWhen the ears do not hear yet the essence resides in the kidneys,\nWhen the tongue does not speak yet the spirit dwells in the heart,\nWhen the nose does not scent yet the *pò* lingers in the lungs,\nWhen the limbs do not move yet the intent rests in the spleen—\nthis is called **Five *Qi* Returning to the Primordial**.\n\nRefine essence into *qi*,\nRefine *qi* into spirit,\nRefine spirit into the **Void**—\nthus it is called **Three Flowers Converging at the Crown**.\n\nWhen the *arcanum* is in the liver yet does not leak through the eyes,\nWhen the *pò* is in the lungs yet does not leak through the nose,\nWhen the spirit is in the heart yet does not leak through the mouth,\nWhen the essence is in the kidneys yet does not leak through the ears,\nWhen the intent is in the spleen yet does not leak through the orifices—\nthis is called **Leakless**.\n\nEssence, spirit, *arcanum*, *pò*, and intent\nintermingle and coalesce into one *qi*,\nInvisible, inaudible, nameless—\nthus it is called **Primordial Void**.\n\nRefining essence means refining **Primordial Essence**—\nnot the lustful essence from carnal indulgence.\nRefining *qi* means refining **Primordial *Qi***—\nnot the breath inhaled through mouth and nose.\nRefining spirit means refining **Primordial Spirit**—\nnot the mental projections of heart and mind.\nThus, this **spirit, *qi*, and essence**\nshare the same root as Heaven and Earth,\nthe same body as all things.\nObtain them and live; lose them and die.\n\nRefine with **yang fire**, and it becomes **yang *qi**;\nNourish with **yin符 (talisman)**, and it becomes **yin essence**.\nThus it is said:\n*Perceived, it cannot be used;\nUsed, it cannot be perceived.*\n\nThe body is the **dwelling of the heart**;\nThe heart is the **sovereign of the body**.\nWhen the heart rages like a dragon,\nThe body becomes fierce as a tiger.\nWithin the body lies a point of **true yang *qi***;\nWithin the heart lies a point of **true yin essence**.\nThus it is called **Two Substances**.\n\nThe heart belongs to **Kàn (water)**;\nThe body belongs to **Kūn (earth)**—\nthus it is called the **Kàn-Kūn Cauldron**.\n\n**Yang *qi*** belongs to **Lí (fire)**;\n**Yin essence** belongs to **Kàn (water)**—\nthus it is called **Wu-Tù (Tortoise-Hare) Medicine**.\n\nEmbrace the One, guard the Center,\nRefine the Primordial, nourish the Substantial—\nthus it is called **Harvesting the Primordial Mixed-Essence *Qi***.\n\nMorning **Zhèn (thunder, ☳)**, evening **Méng (darkness, ☴)**,\nNoon **Dù (midday, ☲)**, midnight **Zǐ (child, ☉)**—\nthus it is called **Circulating the Fire of the Heavenly Cycle**.\n\nWood’s **liquid** thrives at **Mǎo (3–5 AM)**,\nMetal’s **essence** thrives at **Yǒu (5–7 PM)**—\nthus one must **bathe**.\n\n**Zhèn (thunder, ☳)**-male drinks **west wine**,\n**Duì (lake, ☱)**-female plucks **north blossoms**,\n**Xùn (wind, ☴)**-wind stirs the six yangs,\n**Kūn (earth, ☷)**-soil conceals the seven numbers—\nthus one must **draw and supplement**.\n\nAt the onset of gathering medicine,\nOne moves the **Kàn-Kūn (water-earth) latchkey**,\nExtracts the **Kàn-Lí (water-fire) blade and pill**.\nInitially, like clouds filling a thousand peaks,\nThen like the moon embracing ten thousand waters—\nnaturally like the **tortoise and serpent’s union**,\nLike the **ox and horse’s pacing**.\n\nThe **Dragon contends for the *arcanum***,\nThe **Tiger contends for the *pò***,\nThe **Crow battles for essence**,\nThe **Hare battles for spirit**—\nIn the **dim haze**, true **lead** appears;\nIn the **obscure void**, true **mercury** emerges.\n\nWith **Yellow Nurse** as matchmaker,\nGuarded in the **Central Palace**.\nLead meets fire and **ascends**,\nMercury meets fire and **flees**.\nThus, with **Non-Being as oil**, it is blended,\nAnd with **Nameless Crude**, it is **settled**.\nLead returns to the **Kūn Palace**,\nMercury returns to the **Kàn Position**—\nTrue earth merges, **luminous and silent**.\n\nExcessive fire causes **dryness**,\nExcessive water causes **overflow**—\nDryness and overflow must be **regulated**,\nHence the **scales and measures**.\n\nAt this stage of cultivation:\nThe **cinnabar field** generates wind,\nThe **vermilion palace** shines with moon,\nThe **elixir field** blazes with fire,\nThe **grain sea** ripples clear,\nThe **spine’s groove** resembles a chariot wheel,\nThe limbs become like mountains,\nThe pores open as after bathing,\nThe bones and vessels relax as in deep sleep,\nThe spirit unites like husband and wife,\nThe *arcanum* and *pò* cling like mother and child—\nThis is the **true realm**, not metaphor.\n\nRefine with **scales and measures**,\nAnd it **congeals without dispersing**.\nRefine with **weights and balances**,\nAnd it **coalesces ever firmer**.\nThe *arcanum* is hidden, the *pò* is extinguished,\nEssence condenses, spirit solidifies—\nOne intent harmonizes, the flesh becomes **luminous and transparent**.\nDay by day, hour by hour,\nIt **gradually congeals and gathers**,\nFrom **formlessness to form**,\nStructuring the **Sacred Embryo**.\n\nA year has **twelve months**,\nA month has **thirty days**,\nA day has **one hundred *kè* (quarter-hours)**.\nA month totals **three thousand *kè***,\nTen months total **thirty thousand *kè***.\nIn **sitting, standing, walking, resting**,\nIt persists **unbroken**.\n\nOnce the **embryonic *qi*** congeals,\nThe **infant form** manifests,\nThe **dark pearl** takes shape,\n**Taiyi** embraces the **True**.\nWithin **thirty thousand *kè***,\nOne can **seize the thirty thousand years** of Heaven.\nHow so?\nEach *kè* contains a **year’s seasonal shifts**.\nThus, **thirty thousand *kè*** can **seize thirty thousand years**.\nHence, a year’s **twelve months** total **thirty-six thousand**.\n\nEven the **foolish commoner**, practicing this,\nInstantly ascends to the **Sacred Realm**.\nYet the masses, in their daily lives,\nUnknowingly **lose their Primordial Essence**,\n**exhaust their Primordial *Qi***,\n**sever their Primordial Spirit**.\nThus, every *kè* must be **harmonized**.\nIf even one *kè* is amiss,\nThe **medicinal materials decay**,\nThe **fire’s timing falters**.\nThus it is said:\n*A hair’s breadth of deviation—no elixir is made.*\nTherefore, one must **attend to each *kè***,\nYet do so **without effort**.\n\nTrue *qi* congeals, the Primordial Spirit expands.\nInternally, one refines **thirty thousand *kè*** of elixir in a year;\nExternally, one **seizes thirty thousand years**.\nOn a grand scale, one **forms a fetus** of **thirteen thousand five hundred breaths** in a day;\nOn a small scale, one **circulates eighty-four thousand *lǐ*** in twelve *shí* (two-hour periods).\n\n「Therefore, it is said: **Seize the Yang** of a single point from Heaven and Earth,\nAnd **harvest the Qi** of the two wheels of Sun and Moon.\n\n**Circulate the True Water** in the Lead Furnace,\nAnd **move the True Fire** in the Mercury Tripod.\n\nWhen Lead encounters Mercury,\nIt is called the **Flowering Pool**.\nWhen Mercury enters Lead,\nIt is called **Divine Water**.\n\nOne must not **cling to inaction**,\nNor **manifest in overt action**,\nNor **fixate on visualization**,\nNor **obsessionally adhere to retention**,\nNor **sit in vain and lose resolve**,\nNor **practice blindly and refine recklessly**.\n\n**True Earth subdues True Lead**,\nAnd **True Lead restrains True Mercury**.\nWhen Lead and Mercury **return to True Earth**,\nThe body and mind **become still and unmoved**.\n\nThe Dao of the Golden Elixir\nHas no other principle than Lead, Mercury, and Earth—\nLead is the **True Water of Metal**,\nMercury is the **True Fire of Wood**.\n\nThe methods of the Elixir **reverse the Five Phases** to achieve wondrous effects,\nThus, Earth **subdues Lead**,\nAnd Lead **restrains Mercury**,\n**Devouring and being devoured**,\nAll **die and return to the thick Earth**,\nAnd only then does the Golden Elixir **begin to take form**.\n\n**True Earth** refers to the **Earth of the Self**.\nThe Master of Upper Yang said:\n*\"To **subdue Water** and seek Lead with the **Earth of the Self**—this is correct.\nFor the **Qi of True Lead** is concealed within the **Gate of the Twenty-Eight**,\nAnd I **ride its movement** to take it.\nIf there is no **Earth of the Self**,\nThen the **resonance and response** will be misaligned,\nAnd the **medicinal material** will never be obtained.*\n\nThe **true adept** must **discern and extract the True Mind** here.\nWhen the **True Mind** issues forth a **True Intent**,\n**Twisting and probing** it,\n**Searching and refining** it,\n**Nurturing it with gentleness**,\nThis is the **pith and marrow**—\nAs the *Paramartha Contract* says:\n*\"**Embrace the subtle and profound**,\n**Unfold and reveal the treasure**.\"*\n\nThis is the **essential key** to seeking Lead.\n\nYet, when it is called **True**,\nIt is taken in the sense of **unadulterated and pure**.\nIf Lead is **True Lead** but Earth is not **True Earth**,\nThen **True cannot contain True**,\nAnd **impurity cannot align with the Dao**.\n\nWhen the **medicinal material is obtained** and **returned to the Tripod**,\nIt is the **Mercury of my own Yin**,\nNaturally **subdued and controlled**,\n**Summoning Lead** yet **neither scattering nor fleeing**—\nFor what reason?\nFire is extinguished by Water,\nWood is subdued by Metal—\nThese are the **natural ways** of no great wonder.\n\nThe *Paramartha Contract* states:\n*\"When Water is excessive, Fire is extinguished—annihilation.\nAll return to the thick Earth.\"*\n\nThe **wondrous interplay of the Five Phases** is such:\nWater meets Earth and is **smothered**,\nFire meets Earth and is **concealed**.\nAll things **cannot be born without Earth**,\nThus the Elixir method **culminates in returning to Earth**.\n\n**Nourishing the Holy Fetus**,\n**Perfecting the Elixir**,\nHas no other path than this.\nYet when **returning to Earth**,\nThe body and mind **both become still and unmoved**—\nFor the **body and mind** are the **two strings** of **Yin and Yang Qi**,\nAs the *Canon* says:\n*\"Divide the body and mind into upper and lower,\nThe two strings are the Dao of the Golden Elixir—\n**Movement** is its **function**,\n**Stillness** is its **substance**.\nWhen **still and unmoved**, it is **stillness**—\nThus, from here onward, the **mysteries of returning to stillness** are spoken of.\"*\n\n**Emptiness and Nothingness** generate **White Snow**,\n**Stillness and Quietude** sprout **Yellow Sprouts**.\nThe **Jade Furnace** warms with **gentle Fire**,\nThe **Golden Tripod** ascends **Purple Mist**.\n\n**Emptiness and stillness**—\nThe **peak of immobility**—\n**\"White Snow\"** and **\"Yellow Sprouts\"** are both **alternate names for the Elixir**.\nFor **\"White Snow\"** is the **essence of Yin**,\nAnd **\"Yellow Sprouts\"** are the **emerging vitality of Lead**,\nAs the *Paramartha Contract* says:\n*\"Yin Fire is white,\nYellow Sprouts are Lead.\"*\n\nWhen the body and mind are **still and unmoved**,\nThe Elixir resides in the **Central Palace**,\nAnd only **harmonious Qi** of spring warmth is seen—\n**Vitality and movement** flourish abundantly,\nLike **White Snow** drifting in the **void**,\nLike **Yellow Sprouts** bursting from the **soil**.\nAt this time, the **refinement of Fire** must not be too **dry**,\nBut should **nurture it gently**,\nAnd **preserve it softly**.\n\nAs our **Holy Master** spoke:\n*\"The Elixir furnace of the River East rests in **tranquility**,\nThe **Fetus of the Crane** and the **Breath of the Tortoise** naturally **soften**.\"*\n\nAs for the **mists ascending the Tripod**,\nIt is the **Yang Light striking the crown**—\nA metaphor for **external Elixir** using the **furnace’s fire**,\nEasily understood.\n\n**Flowering Pool blooms the Lotus**,\n**Divine Water** stirs **Golden Waves**.\nThe night is deep, the moon is bright and clear—\n**Heaven and Earth** as a **single wheel of mirror**.\n\n**Flowering Pool** and **Divine Water** have many interpretations.\nAn ancient verse says:\n*\"The **foundation of life** lies only in the **Golden Flowering Pool**.\"*\nNow, applying the words of **enlightenment**,\n**\"Flowering Pool blooms the Lotus\"** refers to the **virgin maiden’s first bloom** in the **Northern Land**.\n**\"Divine Water\"** is the **True Mercury of the Self**.\n**\"Golden Waves\"**—\nThe **ultimate clarity of water and stillness**.\n\n**\"The night is deep, the moon is bright and clear\"**—\nAt the **midnight hour**, the **moonlight shines** in the **Northern Sea**.\n**\"Deep night\"** is the **juncture of Hài and Zǐ**,\nThe **time of the Winter Solstice**.\n**\"Heaven and Earth as a single wheel of mirror\"**—\nThe **peak of luminous purity**.\n\nFor the **medicinal material** must first **be rich in Qi** before it is **born**,\nAnd **still and settled** before it is **harvested**.\nWhen the **Metal Essence is robust and flourishing**,\nAnd the **Moon’s Radiance** is **clear and pure**,\nThe **Golden Lotus** half-unfolds,\nThe **Elixir Sprout** is fresh and new.\nTo **harvest it at this moment**,\nOne must **guard it with serenity**,\nAnd **prioritize it with non-contention**—\nThis is called **clear water and pure waves**,\nAnd only then can it **reflect all phenomena**,\nAnd the **Pearl of the Tortoise** be obtained.\n\nOtherwise, if there is **disturbance within**,\nThe **essence will scatter**,\nAnd **calamity, regret, and remorse** will arise from it,\nAnd the **medicinal material** will never be obtained.\n\n**Cinnabar refines the Yang Qi**,\n**Quick-silver cooks the Metal Essence**.\nThe **Metal Essence** and the **Yang Qi**—\n**Cinnabar** and **Quick-silver**—\nAre both **alternate names for the Elixir**.\nWhen speaking of **\"Cinnabar\"**, it is the **Yang Qi** being refined.\nWhen speaking of **\"Quick-silver\"**, it is the **Metal Essence** being cooked.\nFor the Elixir **relies on Fire** to transform,\nThus, in the **twelve double-hours**,\nWhen **Yang Fire** refines it,\nIt becomes **Yang Qi**.\nAnd **\"Cinnabar\"** is where the **Yang Qi** **congeals**.\nWhen **Yin Symbols** nurture it,\nIt becomes **Yin Essence**.\nAnd **\"Quick-silver\"** is where the **Yin Essence** **forms**.\nYet the **Metal Essence** and the **Yang Qi** are **one and the same**.\n\nThus, it is summarized:\n*\"The **Metal Essence** and the **Yang Qi**—\n**Cinnabar** and **Quick-silver**.\"*\n\nNow it is known:\n**One substance in two forms**,\nWhich cannot be **clearly divided** into two—\nOnly **according to the Fire and Symbols** does it **shift**.\n\nThe sequence states:\n*\"When refined by Yang Fire, it becomes Yang Qi;\nWhen nurtured by Yin Symbols, it becomes Yin Essence.\"*\nThis is its intent.\n\n◎ The **Sun’s soul** is the **fat of the Jade Rabbit**,\nThe **Moon’s shadow** is the **marrow of the Golden Crow**.\nWhen gathered into the **Cauldron**, they merge as **one pool of water**.\nFor the **precise essences of Yin and Yang** intermingle within,\nThus it is said: *\"The soul\"*—the **essence of the Great Yang**—\nIs the **fat of the Jade Rabbit**, the **central line of Kan**,\nWhich is **true lead**.\n\nThe **Moon’s shadow**—the **substance of Great Yin**—\nIs the **marrow of the Golden Crow**, the **central line of Li**,\nWhich is **true mercury**.\n\nThus, the **two medicines of Crow and Rabbit**,\nWhen gathered into the **Cauldron**, dissolve into **water**,\nAnd become the **Golden Elixir**.\nAs the *Paramartha Agreement* says:\n*\"Dissolving into water, the horse-tooth lapis.\"*\n\nIndeed, the **medicine’s origin** knows no greater than **one breath ascending from the steamer-mountain**,\nThen transforming into **water**—first as **liquid**, then congealing—\nAnd thus the **Returning Elixir** is complete.\nAll texts speak of **Jade Nectar and Sweet Dew**,\n**Bathing the Crown with Curdled Milk**—\nNone exceed this.\n\n◎ The **medicine’s birth** lies in the **Mysterious Aperture**,\nThe **fire’s timing** ignites the **Yang Furnace**.\nWhen **Dragon and Tiger** cease their union,\nThe **Treasure Cauldron** births the **Mysterious Pearl**.\n\nAs above, the **medicine and fire’s timing** have been clearly expounded.\nThe **Immortal Sage** feared others might not grasp their **interaction**,\nThus further revealing this **one aperture**.\nIts meaning is already seen in the sequence:\n\n*\"Within the body, there is one aperture called the **Mysterious Female**—\nNot the heart, not the kidneys,\nNot the mouth or nose,\nNot the spleen or stomach,\nNot the anal passage or bladder,\nNor the **Elixir Field** or **Mud Ball**.\nTo know this **one aperture** is to know the **Winter Solstice** within,\nThe **medicine** within,\nThe **fire’s timing** within,\nThe **bathing** within,\nThe **gestation** within,\nThe **shedding of the body** within.\n\nThis **one aperture** has no boundaries, no inside or outside—\nIt is the **root of spirit-qi** and the **valley of emptiness**.\nThus, seeking it within the body,\nOne must not seek it elsewhere.\"*\n\nSuch instruction is concise yet exhaustive.\n\n◎ This **aperture** is no ordinary one—\nIt is the **union of Heaven and Earth**, formed together.\nNamed the **Spirit-Qi Cavity**,\nWithin it dwell the **essences of Kan and Li**.\n\n*\"Someone asks: What are the **medicines**?\nThe **medicine** is the **true Yin-Yi qi of Kan**—**true lead**.\nThe **substance** is the **long-accumulated essence of Li**—**true mercury**.\"*\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says:\n*\"Faint and indistinct, yet within it lies the **substance**.\"*\nThis refers to the **substance**.\n\n*\"Dark and obscure, yet within it lies the **essence**.\nIts essence is most true, within it lies the **verity**.\"*\nThis refers to the **medicine**.\n\nThe **medicine and substance** arise from the **dark and indistinct**,\nYet it is said they arise from the **Mysterious Aperture**—\nFor the **dwellings of Yin and Yang** hold their **true essences** intermingled.\nAt this time, **Dragon and Tiger** have not yet united,\nThe **Mysterious Female** has not yet formed.\nThus, they still belong to **two families**.\nOnce gathered in one place,\nThe **spirit-qi** naturally returns to its **root**,\nAnd within the **void**, this **one aperture**—the **Mysterious Female**—emerges.\nWithin it, the **medicine and substance** grow daily and monthly,\nUntil at **three hundred cycles**, the **transformation is complete**—\n**gestation, shedding the body, divine metamorphosis**—\nAll stem from this.\nThus it is said: *\"Gestation is here, shedding the body is here.\"*\n\nWhen asked why the **fire’s timing** and **Winter Solstice** are within,\nIt is said: *\"The **fire’s timing** is the **circuit of Heaven’s numbers**,\nThe **surrounding revolutions** are all within this place.\nThe **Winter Solstice** is here—from **obscurity to dawn**,\nWhen **Thunder arrives to receive the Symbols**,\nThe **Yang Furnace** ignites—\nAll occur within this.\nYet this is not the **Winter Solstice** of others.\nThus it is said: *‘Seek it within the body, not elsewhere.’*\nThe **Immortal Sage’s words** carry deep meaning—\nSaying *‘seek it within’* teaches one to **first recognize it in the body**,\nSaying *‘not elsewhere’* shows that **seeking it elsewhere** is also possible at times.\"\n\n◎ **One point of Wood Mercury** glows red,\n**Four catties of Gold Lead** are black.\nWhen **Lead and Mercury** coalesce into a **pearl**,\nIt shines **bright and wondrous—wisteria gold**.\n\n**Wood Mercury** is the **spirit of the previous cycle’s mercury**,\nWith not even a **dram’s weight**, hence *\"one point.\"*\nThe **Upper Yang Master** said:\n*\"Take a **nearby true mercury** to welcome it.\"*\n**Gold Lead** is the **true Yin-Yi water of Kan**,\nFrom which **gold is born in water**, hence *\"day-gold lead.\"*\nSpeaking of **three catties** means **forty-eight taels**.\nEach **tael of true lead** weighs **three chins**—\nTotaling **one hundred forty-four chins**,\nThe **strategy number of Kun**.\n\nFor **Gold Lead’s** complete form remains unbroken,\nIts **chins and taels** are whole—\nThus this count.\n**Cinnabar** is another name for the **Returning Elixir’s Golden Liquid**.\n**Wisteria** is the color of **red and black combined**.\nThe *Paramartha Agreement* says:\n*\"Its hue shifts to wisteria, then **brightly becomes the Returning Elixir**.\"*\n**Bright and wondrous** is the same as *\"brightly.\"*\nThe **Golden Elixir** is the **substance without substance**,\nNot to be sought by **form or appearance**.\nThe **Immortal Sage**, through **prescriptions and symbols**, reverses the analogy to guide others—\nThe intent lies beyond the **words and meaning**.\nIf one insists on seeking the so-called *\"bright wisteria gold\"*\nBefore calling it **Elixir**, then such a person speaks in **dreams**,\nFar from the truth.\n\n◎ The **homestead’s scenery** is splendid,\n**Spring rains** deepen as the **wind blows**.\nPlowing and hoeing require **no effort**—\nThe **entire earth turns to gold**.\n\n*\"The **homestead**\" refers to the **body within**.\n*\"Splendid scenery\"* means the **medicine is complete**.\n*\"Spring rains\"* and *\"wind\"* signify the **fire’s timing is sufficient**.\n\nWhen the **medicine is gathered into the Cauldron**,\nAnd one **embraces unity**, **abiding in the center**—\nAll must be **harmonized with the Oil of Non-Action**,\n**Settled by the Nameless Pebble**—\nThus, though there is **plowing and hoeing**, no **labor is spent**.\nWhen the **work is complete** and the **medicine transforms**,\nThe **entire earth becomes gold**.\nThe **earth** also refers to **the body**.\nAs when **blood turns to white grease**,\n**Bones become jade and alabaster**,\n**Yin is exhausted, Yang is pure**,\n**Form and substance are altered**—\nA **golden body of sixteen feet**,\n**Unspoiled for ten thousand kalpas—**\nHow could this be empty words?\n\n「One version reads *\"not exhausting labor\"* (不废力), meaning one does not neglect its work. Yet, considering the sense of *\"using without strain\"* (用之不勤) and *\"difficult to exhaust with toil\"* (难以愁劳), the reading *\"not expending\"* (不费) is superior.\n\n◎ **True Lead (真铅)** is born in **Kan (坎)**, its use lies in the **Li Palace (离宫)**.\nWith black turning to red, a single cauldron’s **qi** becomes dense.\nThis refers to the **land where the medicine is produced** and the **place where it is used**.\n**True Lead** born in **Kan** means **gold is produced from water**, and its use in the **Li Palace** is to subdue **Mercury (汞)**.\nThe **elixir method** uses black to invest red—at this moment, the **True Qi (真气)** ascends and descends, fusing the essence like **mist rising from mountains and lakes**.\nYet the *\"initial dense clouds filling the thousand mountains\"* (初时云满千山) in the sequence hints at this very stage.\n\n◎ **True Mercury (真汞)** is produced in **Li (离)**, its use however returns to **Kan (坎)**.\nA **lovely maiden (姹女)** passes through the **Southern Garden (南园)**, holding a **jade olive (玉橄榄)**.\n**True Mercury** produced in **Li** means **fire generates the southern realm**, and its use in **Kan** is to seek **Lead (铅)**.\nThe **lovely maiden** is **Mercury**, the **Southern Garden** its native domain; *\"passing through the Southern Garden\"* means departing from its own southern realm.\nDeparting from the **Southern Garden**, traveling to the **western neighbor** (西邻), then **they contend and support each other**, and the **Dark Pearl (玄珠)** manifests its form.\n**Jade olive (玉橄榄)** is another name for the **Dark Pearl**.\nOlives are **bitter yet sweet**—taking this to illustrate is most clear and apt.\n\n◎ **Zhen (震)** and **Dui (兑)** are neither east nor west,\n**Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)** are neither south nor north.\nThe **Big Dipper’s handle (斗柄)** traverses the **Celestial Cycle (周天)**,\nIts essence lies in **human gathering and compression (攒簇)**.»\n\nThe **Zhen (震)** and **Dui (兑)**, **Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)**—these are the four **symbols (象)** of the **Dao (道)**.\nEast, west, south, north—these are the four **symbols'** positions (位)**.\nWhen crafting the **elixir (丹)**, gather and compress the **Five Phases (五行)**, harmonize the four **symbols**, and return them to the **Central Palace (中宫)**, then east, west, south, and north blend into one.\nThus, **Metal (金)** does not dwell in the west,\n**Wood (木)** does not dwell in the east,\n**Fire (火)** does not dwell in the south,\n**Water (水)** does not dwell in the north.\nWhen neither **hexagram (卦)** nor **trigram (爻)** exists, nor their respective positions,\nand one forgets form and obscures symbol,\nit cannot be sought or questioned—\nyet it is named the **elixir (丹)**.\nBut its essence lies in using the **Big Dipper’s handle (斗柄)** to traverse the **Celestial Cycle (周天)**,\nwith **Fire’s conditions (火侯)** fully observed,\nthen the blending and compression may be achieved.\n\nFor the **Celestial Cycle (周天)** is governed by the **Big Dipper (北斗)**, which distributes the **original qi (元气)**.\nAs the **Celestial Cycle** revolves, the **Five Qi (五气)** flow in sequence, completing the year’s work.\nHumans also possess this.\nIf one cannot *\"observe the Dao of Heaven (观天之道), grasp Heaven’s movements (执天之行)\"*,\nand instead seeks the **human gathering and compression (攒簇)**—the **so-called Celestial Pivot (辰极)**—\nhow can one compress and blend to produce the **true elixir of immortality (真乙之丹)**?\n\n◎ **Fire’s conditions (火侯)** do not require set times,\nnor does the **winter solstice (冬至)** necessarily fall on **zi hour (子)**.\nIn the **bathing method (沐浴法)**, at **mao (卯)** and **you (酉)** hours, the **empty comparison (虚比)** occurs.\nFor the **elixir’s Fire’s conditions (金丹火侯)**,\nthe twelve hours from **zi (子)** onward are **yang (阳)**,\nand the twelve hours from **wu (午)** onward are **yin (阴)**.\nWhen **hai (亥)** and **zi (子)** hours meet,\none **yang** returns—this is called the **winter solstice (冬至)**.\nIn the months of **mao (卯)** and **you (酉)**,\n**Wood (木)** and **Metal (金)** qi flourish,\nand the **bathing method (沐浴)** should be applied.\nAt this point, the **principles of yin and yang (阴阳之定理)** and the **numbers of transformation (造化之成数)**\nmust not differ by even a hair’s breadth.\nYet though the **method (法)** is fixed,\nthe **principles (理)** are boundless and flexible—\nits subtleties lie in the practitioner’s mind.\nThus, the **administration of medicines (入药)** and the **ignition of fire (起火)** have their own advances and retreats;\none need not adhere strictly to **zi (子)** and **wu (午)** hours.\nWhen **Zhen (震)** arrives and receives its **talisman (符)**,\nthere is **true faith (真信)**—\nnot confined to the month of **zi (子)**.\nWhen bathing in the **elixir’s Fire’s conditions (金丹)**,\nat the proper time and season,\nit is not confined to **mao (卯)** and **you (酉)** months.\nThe **medicine administration (入药)** states:\n*\"Within one day, twelve hours;\nWhere the mind reaches, all may be done.\"*\nIt also says:\n*\"At the initial embryo formation, examine one’s natal **command (本命)**;\nAt the final **shedding of the mortal frame (脱胎)**, observe the **four cardinal directions (四正)**.\"*\nThis fully elucidates the matter.\n\n◎ **Crow’s liver (乌肝)** and **rabbit’s marrow (兔髓)**—\nwhen seized, they are found in one place.\nOne **elixir grain (一粒)** follows another,\nfrom the subtle to the manifest.\n**Crow’s liver (乌肝)** and **rabbit’s marrow (兔髓)** are the **essence of Kan and Li (坎离之精)**;\nthey must be seized and returned to one place\nbefore the **golden elixir (金丹)** can be formed.\nWhen **Fire’s conditions (火)** traverse the **Celestial Cycle (周天)**,\nand the work is complete after **three hundred days (三百)**,\nthis is called **one grain per day (日复一粒)**—\nfrom the subtle to the manifest.\nThe **embryo (婴儿)** reveals its form,\nand the **shedding of the mortal frame (脱胎)** achieves **spiritual transformation (神化)**.\n\n◎ **Chaos (混沌)** embraces the **void (虚空)**,\nthe **void** encompasses the **Three Realms (三界)**.\nYet when seeking its roots,\none finds a **grain of millet (黍米)** in size.\nThe **Three Realms (三界)**—the **Realm of Desire (欲界)**, the **Realm of Form (色界)**, and the **Realm of Formlessness (无色界)**—\nall are contained within the **void (虚空)**,\nand **Chaos (混沌)** embraces them.\n**Chaos (混沌)** is the **preheaven undifferentiated (先天无极)**.\nWhen the **elixir method (丹法)** returns the **spiritual qi (神气)** to its root,\nthe **void (虚无)** gives rise to **orifices (生窍)**,\nand within the **formless (无质)** arises **sacred substance (灵质)**—\nthis is the **void** encompassing the **Three Realms**.\nAfter **shedding of the mortal frame (脱胎)**,\nall return to the **void (虚无)**,\nto **Chaos (混沌)**,\nand are then called **accomplished (了当)**—\nthis is **Chaos** embracing the **void**.\nYet when seeking the **foundation of one’s life (立命之根源)**,\nit is still just a **grain-sized Dark Pearl (一黍玄珠)**,\nfrom the subtle to the manifest.\nFor the **grain of millet (黍米)**,\nit is the **having within the none (无中之有)**;\nwhen **shedding of the mortal frame (脱胎)** achieves **spiritual transformation (神化)**,\nit returns once more to the **none (无)**—\nthen the **sage (圣人)** is beyond knowing,\nand the **Way (道)** is truly united.\n\n◎ When **Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)** interact, **true fluid (真液)** emerges;\nwhen **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)** contain **true essence (真精)**.\nIf one grasps the **foundation of Kan and Li (坎离基)**,\nthen the **Three Realms (三界)** return to one body.\n**Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)** are the **body of yin and yang’s union (阴阳配合之体)**,\nwhile **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)** are the **essence of yin and yang’s mutual concealment (阴阳互藏之精)**.\nWhen **Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)** interact,\nthe **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)**’s essences merge—\n**true essence (真精)** merges, then **Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)**’s **true fluid (真液)** flows.\n**Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)** are the **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)**;\nif humans grasp this to establish the **elixir’s foundation (丹基)**,\nthen the **cosmos lies within the hand (宇宙在乎手)**,\nand **transformation arises from the body (万化生乎身)**—\nthus the **Three Realms (三界)** return to one body.\nThe **Three Realms (三界)** are the **upper, middle, and lower (上中下)**,\nall inherently possessed by the human body.\nUsing **essence (精)** achieves the **Realm of Desire (欲界)**,\nusing **qi (气)** achieves the **Realm of Form (色界)**,\nusing **spirit (神)** achieves the **Realm of Formlessness (无色界)**.\n\n◎ The **Dragon (龙)** emerges from the **Eastern Sea (东海)**,\nthe **Tiger (虎)** rises from the **Western Mountain (西山)**.\nThe two beasts wage war in one battle,\ntransforming into **Heaven and Earth’s marrow (天地髓)**.\nSince the **medicines (药物)** belong to **Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)**,\nwhat are the **Dragon (龙)** and **Tiger (虎)**?\nThe **elixir scriptures (丹书)** blend varied names and characters,\nyet they originate from one source.\nFor **Kan (坎)**’s **Lead (铅)** is hard to obtain,\nyet easy to **devour (咥)** humans—\nthus it is symbolized by the **Tiger (虎)**;\n**Li (离)**’s **Mercury (汞)** is fond of **fleeing (飞)**,\nyet hard to **control (控御)**—\nthus it is symbolized by the **Dragon (龙)**.\nThe **Dragon (龙)** comes from the **Eastern Sea (东海)**,\nand then **subdues the Tiger (就虎)**;\nThe **Tiger (虎)** rises from the **Western Mountain (西山)**,\nand then **follows the Dragon (超而从龙)**.\nThe **elixir method (丹法)** drives the **Dragon (龙)** to subdue the **Tiger (虎)**,\nand harnesses the **Tiger (虎)** to follow the **Dragon (龙)**.\nThus these two beasts **devour and are devoured (相呑相啖)**,\nclashing in the **pentagon (戊己之宫)**,\nthen blending and merging harmoniously—\ntransforming into **Heaven and Earth’s marrow (天地髓)**,\nand thus the **returned elixir (还丹)** may be achieved.\nIndeed, **Heaven and Earth’s marrow (天地髓)** is the **essence of Kan and Li (坎离之精)**—\nhow could there be two?\n\n◎ The **golden flower (金花)** blooms on **Mercury’s (汞)** leaf,\nthe **jade embryo (玉蒂)** grows on **Lead’s (铅)** branch.\n**Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)** never separate—\n**Heaven (乾)** and **Earth (坤)** endure through time.\nGrasses and trees hold flowers within their leaves,\nwhile **embryos (蒂)** grow on branches above—\nall are the **marvel of yin and yang’s mutual roots (阴阳互根)**,\n**intertwining and binding (相纽相结)**.\nApplied to the **elixir method (丹法)**,\nthe **golden flower (金华)** blooms on **Mercury’s (汞)** leaf—\n**yin (阴)** containing **yang (阳)**, the **symbol of Kan’s Lead (坎铅)**.\nThe **jade embryo (玉蒂)** is the **embryo of the hexagram wuji (己之命蒂)**—\n**Yin (鄞)** and **Yang (鄂)** are its names.\nThe **foundation of life (命基)** cannot stand alone;\nit must obtain **true Lead (真铅)** to merge with **its own Mercury (己汞)**,\nthen **spiritual qi (神气)** intertwines and binds,\ngiving birth to the **sacred embryo (圣胎)**—\nthus the **jade embryo (玉蒂)** grows on **Lead’s (铅)** branch.\nThis marvel of **yin and yang’s mutual roots (阴阳构精)**,\n**intertwining and binding (相纽相结)**,\nare all the **natural workings of transformation (造化之自然)**.\nThe **sage (圣人)** names them **Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)**,\nto reveal their **mutually concealed essence (互藏之精)**,\nand symbolizes them as **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)**,\nto capture their **intermingling brilliance (交光之妙)**.\n\nThen the **Dao of the Elixir** becomes manifest,\nand one observes the **Heaven and Earth** in their appointed places,\nthe **Sun and Moon** in their courses,\nthe **day and night** in their ceaseless cycles—\nnot a single breath’s pause exists,\nyet the **Heaven and Earth** remain unbroken.\nThus is the **eternal day of ten thousand ages** realized.\nTherefore, the **Heaven and Earth** of ten thousand ages\nare the **Sun and Moon** of ten thousand ages;\nthe **Sun and Moon** of ten thousand ages\nare the **Dao of the Elixir** of ten thousand ages.\nWere the **Sun and Moon** to ever halt in their motion,\nall things would cease to arise,\nand the **Heaven and Earth** would nearly perish—\nhow then could the **Elixir Body** endure its eternal vitality?\n\nNow, who speaks of the **eternal day of ten thousand ages**?\nSome interpret the **moment’s work** within the sequence\nas seizing the **measure of a year**—\nthis reasoning falls far short of the truth.\n\n◎ **Bathing** to avert peril, **refining and supplementing** with utmost caution.\nAll depends on **three ten-thousand moments**—\na single misstep risks ruin by a hair’s breadth.\nWhen the **Moon** aligns with **Mao-Wei** (卯酉),\nand **Yin and Yang’s virtue** confronts the threshold,\nthe method demands **bathing**.\n**Bathing** is precisely what averts peril.\nFor **bathing** encompasses two meanings:\nFirst, in **Mao-Wei months**, **Wood and Metal qi** flourish;\nadding **Fire** risks **flight and dispersion**.\nSecond, in **Mao-Wei months**, **Yin and Yang qi** balance;\nadding **Fire** risks **imbalance and excess**.\nThus, **bathing** and **halting Fire** avert peril.\n**Refining** means extracting **Lead**,\n**supplementing** means adding **Mercury**.\n**Utmost caution** means advancing and retreating,\nascending and descending—\nall must conform to **Heaven’s measure**.\nA single thought’s deviation invites **regret and calamity**,\nand the **three ten-thousand moments’** labor will be lost.\n**Three ten-thousand moments** span **ten months**.\nThe terms **refining** and **supplementing**—\nmany scholars fail to grasp them;\nI have already expounded them in the *Play of Mystic Hide*.\n\n◎ When **Yin and Yang** unite in copulation,\nthe **Cloud-Rain Chamber** stirs with passion.\nA year’s gestation yields a child—\neach child born astride a crane.\nThe **Dao of the Golden Elixir**:\nif followed, it **perfects the Sage**;\nif reversed, it **forges the Elixir**.\nThus, the **Old Immortal’s** final verse\nillustrates the **Cloud-Rain Chamber’s** union—\na means to make it plain to all.\nYet it is not the **worldly** union of **husband and wife**.\nThe **Sage** penetrates **Yin and Yang**,\nand in their **mutually concealed abode**,\nsteals their mechanism and inverts its use.\nThus, **conception within the womb** remains unchanged,\nbut **emergence from the womb** defies all measure.\nYet whether **riding the Dragon** or **controlling the Crane**,\nthese are but **manifestations of Yang essence’s** power.\n**Spirit** accomplishes all,\n**Spirit** transcends all—\nhow can it be confined by ordinary perception or reasoning?",

Ming*\n\nThe **Seven Refunds and Nine Returns Golden Elixir**—seven denotes the number of fire, nine the number of metal.\nTo refine metal with fire, returning to the origin and restoring the essence, is called **Golden Elixir**.\nDivide the body and mind into upper and lower strings,\nDistinguish the spirit-*qi* at the winter and summer solstices,\nAlign the form and spirit with the **Kàn-Lí** (water-fire) hexagrams.\nGather the five phases:\nEast—**arcanum** (hún, soul) of wood,\nWest—**pò** (corporeal essence) of metal,\nSouth—**shén** (spirit) of fire,\nNorth—**jīng** (essence) of water,\nCenter—**yì** (intent) of earth.\nThus, the five phases converge.\n\nTo **contain the luminous gaze**, **condense the resonant breath**,\n**harmonize the nasal breath**, **seal the tongue’s *qi***—\nthis is the **unification of the four symbols**.\n\nWhen the eyes do not see yet the *arcanum* abides in the liver,\nWhen the ears do not hear yet the essence resides in the kidneys,\nWhen the tongue does not speak yet the spirit dwells in the heart,\nWhen the nose does not scent yet the *pò* lingers in the lungs,\nWhen the limbs do not move yet the intent rests in the spleen—\nthis is called **Five *Qi* Returning to the Primordial**.\n\nRefine essence into *qi*,\nRefine *qi* into spirit,\nRefine spirit into the **Void**—\nthus it is called **Three Flowers Converging at the Crown**.\n\nWhen the *arcanum* is in the liver yet does not leak through the eyes,\nWhen the *pò* is in the lungs yet does not leak through the nose,\nWhen the spirit is in the heart yet does not leak through the mouth,\nWhen the essence is in the kidneys yet does not leak through the ears,\nWhen the intent is in the spleen yet does not leak through the orifices—\nthis is called **Leakless**.\n\nEssence, spirit, *arcanum*, *pò*, and intent\nintermingle and coalesce into one *qi*,\nInvisible, inaudible, nameless—\nthus it is called **Primordial Void**.\n\nRefining essence means refining **Primordial Essence**—\nnot the lustful essence from carnal indulgence.\nRefining *qi* means refining **Primordial *Qi***—\nnot the breath inhaled through mouth and nose.\nRefining spirit means refining **Primordial Spirit**—\nnot the mental projections of heart and mind.\nThus, this **spirit, *qi*, and essence**\nshare the same root as Heaven and Earth,\nthe same body as all things.\nObtain them and live; lose them and die.\n\nRefine with **yang fire**, and it becomes **yang *qi**;\nNourish with **yin符 (talisman)**, and it becomes **yin essence**.\nThus it is said:\n*Perceived, it cannot be used;\nUsed, it cannot be perceived.*\n\nThe body is the **dwelling of the heart**;\nThe heart is the **sovereign of the body**.\nWhen the heart rages like a dragon,\nThe body becomes fierce as a tiger.\nWithin the body lies a point of **true yang *qi***;\nWithin the heart lies a point of **true yin essence**.\nThus it is called **Two Substances**.\n\nThe heart belongs to **Kàn (water)**;\nThe body belongs to **Kūn (earth)**—\nthus it is called the **Kàn-Kūn Cauldron**.\n\n**Yang *qi*** belongs to **Lí (fire)**;\n**Yin essence** belongs to **Kàn (water)**—\nthus it is called **Wu-Tù (Tortoise-Hare) Medicine**.\n\nEmbrace the One, guard the Center,\nRefine the Primordial, nourish the Substantial—\nthus it is called **Harvesting the Primordial Mixed-Essence *Qi***.\n\nMorning **Zhèn (thunder, ☳)**, evening **Méng (darkness, ☴)**,\nNoon **Dù (midday, ☲)**, midnight **Zǐ (child, ☉)**—\nthus it is called **Circulating the Fire of the Heavenly Cycle**.\n\nWood’s **liquid** thrives at **Mǎo (3–5 AM)**,\nMetal’s **essence** thrives at **Yǒu (5–7 PM)**—\nthus one must **bathe**.\n\n**Zhèn (thunder, ☳)**-male drinks **west wine**,\n**Duì (lake, ☱)**-female plucks **north blossoms**,\n**Xùn (wind, ☴)**-wind stirs the six yangs,\n**Kūn (earth, ☷)**-soil conceals the seven numbers—\nthus one must **draw and supplement**.\n\nAt the onset of gathering medicine,\nOne moves the **Kàn-Kūn (water-earth) latchkey**,\nExtracts the **Kàn-Lí (water-fire) blade and pill**.\nInitially, like clouds filling a thousand peaks,\nThen like the moon embracing ten thousand waters—\nnaturally like the **tortoise and serpent’s union**,\nLike the **ox and horse’s pacing**.\n\nThe **Dragon contends for the *arcanum***,\nThe **Tiger contends for the *pò***,\nThe **Crow battles for essence**,\nThe **Hare battles for spirit**—\nIn the **dim haze**, true **lead** appears;\nIn the **obscure void**, true **mercury** emerges.\n\nWith **Yellow Nurse** as matchmaker,\nGuarded in the **Central Palace**.\nLead meets fire and **ascends**,\nMercury meets fire and **flees**.\nThus, with **Non-Being as oil**, it is blended,\nAnd with **Nameless Crude**, it is **settled**.\nLead returns to the **Kūn Palace**,\nMercury returns to the **Kàn Position**—\nTrue earth merges, **luminous and silent**.\n\nExcessive fire causes **dryness**,\nExcessive water causes **overflow**—\nDryness and overflow must be **regulated**,\nHence the **scales and measures**.\n\nAt this stage of cultivation:\nThe **cinnabar field** generates wind,\nThe **vermilion palace** shines with moon,\nThe **elixir field** blazes with fire,\nThe **grain sea** ripples clear,\nThe **spine’s groove** resembles a chariot wheel,\nThe limbs become like mountains,\nThe pores open as after bathing,\nThe bones and vessels relax as in deep sleep,\nThe spirit unites like husband and wife,\nThe *arcanum* and *pò* cling like mother and child—\nThis is the **true realm**, not metaphor.\n\nRefine with **scales and measures**,\nAnd it **congeals without dispersing**.\nRefine with **weights and balances**,\nAnd it **coalesces ever firmer**.\nThe *arcanum* is hidden, the *pò* is extinguished,\nEssence condenses, spirit solidifies—\nOne intent harmonizes, the flesh becomes **luminous and transparent**.\nDay by day, hour by hour,\nIt **gradually congeals and gathers**,\nFrom **formlessness to form**,\nStructuring the **Sacred Embryo**.\n\nA year has **twelve months**,\nA month has **thirty days**,\nA day has **one hundred *kè* (quarter-hours)**.\nA month totals **three thousand *kè***,\nTen months total **thirty thousand *kè***.\nIn **sitting, standing, walking, resting**,\nIt persists **unbroken**.\n\nOnce the **embryonic *qi*** congeals,\nThe **infant form** manifests,\nThe **dark pearl** takes shape,\n**Taiyi** embraces the **True**.\nWithin **thirty thousand *kè***,\nOne can **seize the thirty thousand years** of Heaven.\nHow so?\nEach *kè* contains a **year’s seasonal shifts**.\nThus, **thirty thousand *kè*** can **seize thirty thousand years**.\nHence, a year’s **twelve months** total **thirty-six thousand**.\n\nEven the **foolish commoner**, practicing this,\nInstantly ascends to the **Sacred Realm**.\nYet the masses, in their daily lives,\nUnknowingly **lose their Primordial Essence**,\n**exhaust their Primordial *Qi***,\n**sever their Primordial Spirit**.\nThus, every *kè* must be **harmonized**.\nIf even one *kè* is amiss,\nThe **medicinal materials decay**,\nThe **fire’s timing falters**.\nThus it is said:\n*A hair’s breadth of deviation—no elixir is made.*\nTherefore, one must **attend to each *kè***,\nYet do so **without effort**.\n\nTrue *qi* congeals, the Primordial Spirit expands.\nInternally, one refines **thirty thousand *kè*** of elixir in a year;\nExternally, one **seizes thirty thousand years**.\nOn a grand scale, one **forms a fetus** of **thirteen thousand five hundred breaths** in a day;\nOn a small scale, one **circulates eighty-four thousand *lǐ*** in twelve *shí* (two-hour periods).",

Water**.\n\nOne must not **cling to inaction**,\nNor **manifest in overt action**,\nNor **fixate on visualization**,\nNor **obsessionally adhere to retention**,\nNor **sit in vain and lose resolve**,\nNor **practice blindly and refine recklessly**.\n\n**True Earth subdues True Lead**,\nAnd **True Lead restrains True Mercury**.\nWhen Lead and Mercury **return to True Earth**,\nThe body and mind **become still and unmoved**.\n\nThe Dao of the Golden Elixir\nHas no other principle than Lead, Mercury, and Earth—\nLead is the **True Water of Metal**,\nMercury is the **True Fire of Wood**.\n\nThe methods of the Elixir **reverse the Five Phases** to achieve wondrous effects,\nThus, Earth **subdues Lead**,\nAnd Lead **restrains Mercury**,\n**Devouring and being devoured**,\nAll **die and return to the thick Earth**,\nAnd only then does the Golden Elixir **begin to take form**.\n\n**True Earth** refers to the **Earth of the Self**.\nThe Master of Upper Yang said:\n*\"To **subdue Water** and seek Lead with the **Earth of the Self**—this is correct.\nFor the **Qi of True Lead** is concealed within the **Gate of the Twenty-Eight**,\nAnd I **ride its movement** to take it.\nIf there is no **Earth of the Self**,\nThen the **resonance and response** will be misaligned,\nAnd the **medicinal material** will never be obtained.*\n\nThe **true adept** must **discern and extract the True Mind** here.\nWhen the **True Mind** issues forth a **True Intent**,\n**Twisting and probing** it,\n**Searching and refining** it,\n**Nurturing it with gentleness**,\nThis is the **pith and marrow**—\nAs the *Paramartha Contract* says:\n*\"**Embrace the subtle and profound**,\n**Unfold and reveal the treasure**.\"*\n\nThis is the **essential key** to seeking Lead.\n\nYet, when it is called **True**,\nIt is taken in the sense of **unadulterated and pure**.\nIf Lead is **True Lead** but Earth is not **True Earth**,\nThen **True cannot contain True**,\nAnd **impurity cannot align with the Dao**.\n\nWhen the **medicinal material is obtained** and **returned to the Tripod**,\nIt is the **Mercury of my own Yin**,\nNaturally **subdued and controlled**,\n**Summoning Lead** yet **neither scattering nor fleeing**—\nFor what reason?\nFire is extinguished by Water,\nWood is subdued by Metal—\nThese are the **natural ways** of no great wonder.\n\nThe *Paramartha Contract* states:\n*\"When Water is excessive, Fire is extinguished—annihilation.\nAll return to the thick Earth.\"*\n\nThe **wondrous interplay of the Five Phases** is such:\nWater meets Earth and is **smothered**,\nFire meets Earth and is **concealed**.\nAll things **cannot be born without Earth**,\nThus the Elixir method **culminates in returning to Earth**.\n\n**Nourishing the Holy Fetus**,\n**Perfecting the Elixir**,\nHas no other path than this.\nYet when **returning to Earth**,\nThe body and mind **both become still and unmoved**—\nFor the **body and mind** are the **two strings** of **Yin and Yang Qi**,\nAs the *Canon* says:\n*\"Divide the body and mind into upper and lower,\nThe two strings are the Dao of the Golden Elixir—\n**Movement** is its **function**,\n**Stillness** is its **substance**.\nWhen **still and unmoved**, it is **stillness**—\nThus, from here onward, the **mysteries of returning to stillness** are spoken of.\"*\n\n**Emptiness and Nothingness** generate **White Snow**,\n**Stillness and Quietude** sprout **Yellow Sprouts**.\nThe **Jade Furnace** warms with **gentle Fire**,\nThe **Golden Tripod** ascends **Purple Mist**.\n\n**Emptiness and stillness**—\nThe **peak of immobility**—\n**\"White Snow\"** and **\"Yellow Sprouts\"** are both **alternate names for the Elixir**.\nFor **\"White Snow\"** is the **essence of Yin**,\nAnd **\"Yellow Sprouts\"** are the **emerging vitality of Lead**,\nAs the *Paramartha Contract* says:\n*\"Yin Fire is white,\nYellow Sprouts are Lead.\"*\n\nWhen the body and mind are **still and unmoved**,\nThe Elixir resides in the **Central Palace**,\nAnd only **harmonious Qi** of spring warmth is seen—\n**Vitality and movement** flourish abundantly,\nLike **White Snow** drifting in the **void**,\nLike **Yellow Sprouts** bursting from the **soil**.\nAt this time, the **refinement of Fire** must not be too **dry**,\nBut should **nurture it gently**,\nAnd **preserve it softly**.\n\nAs our **Holy Master** spoke:\n*\"The Elixir furnace of the River East rests in **tranquility**,\nThe **Fetus of the Crane** and the **Breath of the Tortoise** naturally **soften**.\"*\n\nAs for the **mists ascending the Tripod**,\nIt is the **Yang Light striking the crown**—\nA metaphor for **external Elixir** using the **furnace’s fire**,\nEasily understood.\n\n**Flowering Pool blooms the Lotus**,\n**Divine Water** stirs **Golden Waves**.\nThe night is deep, the moon is bright and clear—\n**Heaven and Earth** as a **single wheel of mirror**.\n\n**Flowering Pool** and **Divine Water** have many interpretations.\nAn ancient verse says:\n*\"The **foundation of life** lies only in the **Golden Flowering Pool**.\"*\nNow, applying the words of **enlightenment**,\n**\"Flowering Pool blooms the Lotus\"** refers to the **virgin maiden’s first bloom** in the **Northern Land**.\n**\"Divine Water\"** is the **True Mercury of the Self**.\n**\"Golden Waves\"**—\nThe **ultimate clarity of water and stillness**.\n\n**\"The night is deep, the moon is bright and clear\"**—\nAt the **midnight hour**, the **moonlight shines** in the **Northern Sea**.\n**\"Deep night\"** is the **juncture of Hài and Zǐ**,\nThe **time of the Winter Solstice**.\n**\"Heaven and Earth as a single wheel of mirror\"**—\nThe **peak of luminous purity**.\n\nFor the **medicinal material** must first **be rich in Qi** before it is **born**,\nAnd **still and settled** before it is **harvested**.\nWhen the **Metal Essence is robust and flourishing**,\nAnd the **Moon’s Radiance** is **clear and pure**,\nThe **Golden Lotus** half-unfolds,\nThe **Elixir Sprout** is fresh and new.\nTo **harvest it at this moment**,\nOne must **guard it with serenity**,\nAnd **prioritize it with non-contention**—\nThis is called **clear water and pure waves**,\nAnd only then can it **reflect all phenomena**,\nAnd the **Pearl of the Tortoise** be obtained.\n\nOtherwise, if there is **disturbance within**,\nThe **essence will scatter**,\nAnd **calamity, regret, and remorse** will arise from it,\nAnd the **medicinal material** will never be obtained.\n\n**Cinnabar refines the Yang Qi**,\n**Quick-silver cooks the Metal Essence**.\nThe **Metal Essence** and the **Yang Qi**—\n**Cinnabar** and **Quick-silver**—\nAre both **alternate names for the Elixir**.\nWhen speaking of **\"Cinnabar\"**, it is the **Yang Qi** being refined.\nWhen speaking of **\"Quick-silver\"**, it is the **Metal Essence** being cooked.\nFor the Elixir **relies on Fire** to transform,\nThus, in the **twelve double-hours**,\nWhen **Yang Fire** refines it,\nIt becomes **Yang Qi**.\nAnd **\"Cinnabar\"** is where the **Yang Qi** **congeals**.\nWhen **Yin Symbols** nurture it,\nIt becomes **Yin Essence**.\nAnd **\"Quick-silver\"** is where the **Yin Essence** **forms**.\nYet the **Metal Essence** and the **Yang Qi** are **one and the same**.\n\nThus, it is summarized:\n*\"The **Metal Essence** and the **Yang Qi**—\n**Cinnabar** and **Quick-silver**.\"*\n\nNow it is known:\n**One substance in two forms**,\nWhich cannot be **clearly divided** into

      "translated_text": "The sequence states:\n*\"When refined by Yang Fire, it becomes Yang Qi;\nWhen nurtured by Yin Symbols, it becomes Yin Essence.\"*\nThis is its intent.\n\n◎ The **Sun’s soul** is the **fat of the Jade Rabbit**,\nThe **Moon’s shadow** is the **marrow of the Golden Crow**.\nWhen gathered into the **Cauldron**, they merge as **one pool of water**.\nFor the **precise essences of Yin and Yang** intermingle within,\nThus it is said: *\"The soul\"*—the **essence of the Great Yang**—\nIs the **fat of the Jade Rabbit**, the **central line of Kan**,\nWhich is **true lead**.\n\nThe **Moon’s shadow**—the **substance of Great Yin**—\nIs the **marrow of the Golden Crow**, the **central line of Li**,\nWhich is **true mercury**.\n\nThus, the **two medicines of Crow and Rabbit**,\nWhen gathered into the **Cauldron**, dissolve into **water**,\nAnd become the **Golden Elixir**.\nAs the *Paramartha Agreement* says:\n*\"Dissolving into water, the horse-tooth lapis.\"*\n\nIndeed, the **medicine’s origin** knows no greater than **one breath ascending from the steamer-mountain**,\nThen transforming into **water**—first as **liquid**, then congealing—\nAnd thus the **Returning Elixir** is complete.\nAll texts speak of **Jade Nectar and Sweet Dew**,\n**Bathing the Crown with Curdled Milk**—\nNone exceed this.\n\n◎ The **medicine’s birth** lies in the **Mysterious Aperture**,\nThe **fire’s timing** ignites the **Yang Furnace**.\nWhen **Dragon and Tiger** cease their union,\nThe **Treasure Cauldron** births the **Mysterious Pearl**.\n\nAs above, the **medicine and fire’s timing** have been clearly expounded.\nThe **Immortal Sage** feared others might not grasp their **interaction**,\nThus further revealing this **one aperture**.\nIts meaning is already seen in the sequence:\n\n*\"Within the body, there is one aperture called the **Mysterious Female**—\nNot the heart, not the kidneys,\nNot the mouth or nose,\nNot the spleen or stomach,\nNot the anal passage or bladder,\nNor the **Elixir Field** or **Mud Ball**.\nTo know this **one aperture** is to know the **Winter Solstice** within,\nThe **medicine** within,\nThe **fire’s timing** within,\nThe **bathing** within,\nThe **gestation** within,\nThe **shedding of the body** within.\n\nThis **one aperture** has no boundaries, no inside or outside—\nIt is the **root of spirit-qi** and the **valley of emptiness**.\nThus, seeking it within the body,\nOne must not seek it elsewhere.\"*\n\nSuch instruction is concise yet exhaustive.\n\n◎ This **aperture** is no ordinary one—\nIt is the **union of Heaven and Earth**, formed together.\nNamed the **Spirit-Qi Cavity**,\nWithin it dwell the **essences of Kan and Li**.\n\n*\"Someone asks: What are the **medicines**?\nThe **medicine** is the **true Yin-Yi qi of Kan**—**true lead**.\nThe **substance** is the **long-accumulated essence of Li**—**true mercury**.\"*\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says:\n*\"Faint and indistinct, yet within it lies the **substance**.\"*\nThis refers to the **substance**.\n\n*\"Dark and obscure, yet within it lies the **essence**.\nIts essence is most true, within it lies the **verity**.\"*\nThis refers to the **medicine**.\n\nThe **medicine and substance** arise from the **dark and indistinct**,\nYet it is said they arise from the **Mysterious Aperture**—\nFor the **dwellings of Yin and Yang** hold their **true essences** intermingled.\nAt this time, **Dragon and Tiger** have not yet united,\nThe **Mysterious Female** has not yet formed.\nThus, they still belong to **two families**.\nOnce gathered in one place,\nThe **spirit-qi** naturally returns to its **root**,\nAnd within the **void**, this **one aperture**—the **Mysterious Female**—emerges.\nWithin it, the **medicine and substance** grow daily and monthly,\nUntil at **three hundred cycles**, the **transformation is complete**—\n**gestation, shedding the body, divine metamorphosis**—\nAll stem from this.\nThus it is said: *\"Gestation is here, shedding the body is here.\"*\n\nWhen asked why the **fire’s timing** and **Winter Solstice** are within,\nIt is said: *\"The **fire’s timing** is the **circuit of Heaven’s numbers**,\nThe **surrounding revolutions** are all within this place.\nThe **Winter Solstice** is here—from **obscurity to dawn**,\nWhen **Thunder arrives to receive the Symbols**,\nThe **Yang Furnace** ignites—\nAll occur within this.\nYet this is not the **Winter Solstice** of others.\nThus it is said: *‘Seek it within the body, not elsewhere.’*\nThe **Immortal Sage’s words** carry deep meaning—\nSaying *‘seek it within’* teaches one to **first recognize it in the body**,\nSaying *‘not elsewhere’* shows that **seeking it elsewhere** is also possible at times.\"\n\n◎ **One point of Wood Mercury** glows red,\n**Four catties of Gold Lead** are black.\nWhen **Lead and Mercury** coalesce into a **pearl**,\nIt shines **bright and wondrous—wisteria gold**.\n\n**Wood Mercury** is the **spirit of the previous cycle’s mercury**,\nWith not even a **dram’s weight**, hence *\"one point.\"*\nThe **Upper Yang Master** said:\n*\"Take a **nearby true mercury** to welcome it.\"*\n**Gold Lead** is the **true Yin-Yi water of Kan**,\nFrom which **gold is born in water**, hence *\"day-gold lead.\"*\nSpeaking of **three catties** means **forty-eight taels**.\nEach **tael of true lead** weighs **three chins**—\nTotaling **one hundred forty-four chins**,\nThe **strategy number of Kun**.\n\nFor **Gold Lead’s** complete form remains unbroken,\nIts **chins and taels** are whole—\nThus this count.\n**Cinnabar** is another name for the **Returning Elixir’s Golden Liquid**.\n**Wisteria** is the color of **red and black combined**.\nThe *Paramartha Agreement* says:\n*\"Its hue shifts to wisteria, then **brightly becomes the Returning Elixir**.\"*\n**Bright and wondrous** is the same as *\"brightly.\"*\nThe **Golden Elixir** is the **substance without substance**,\nNot to be sought by **form or appearance**.\nThe **Immortal Sage**, through **prescriptions and symbols**, reverses the analogy to guide others—\nThe intent lies beyond the **words and meaning**.\nIf one insists on seeking the so-called *\"bright wisteria gold\"*\nBefore calling it **Elixir**, then such a person speaks in **dreams**,\nFar from the truth.\n\n◎ The **homestead’s scenery** is splendid,\n**Spring

      "original_text": "震兑坎离者，四象之卦也。 东西南北者，四象之位也。 作丹之时、攒簇五行，和合四象，而归于中宫，则东西南北混合为一矣。 故金不在西。 木不在东。 火不居南，水不居北。 既无卦爻，亦无方位，忘形罔象，不可致诘，而名之曰丹。 然其要在于以斗柄而运周天，火侯数足，然后混合之功可成。 盖天以北斗鲜酌元气，周天运转，夫是以五气顺布而成岁功，人亦有之。 苟或不能「观天之道，执天之行」，求吾人之所谓辰极者执而运之，焉能攒簇混合而成真乙之丹乎。 ◎火候不须时、冬至岂在子。 及其沐浴法、卯酉时虚比。 金丹火侯，自子以后六时为阳，自午以后六时为阴。 至于亥子之交，一阳来复，名为冬至。 卯酉之月，木金气旺，法当沐浴。 当此盖阴阳之定理，造化之成数，有不可以毫发差殊者。 然法虽死定，理实圆活，运移之妙，存乎一心。 故入药起火自有进退，不用子午也。 震来受符，自有真信，不在子月也。 沐浴金丹，至有时节，不在卯酉也。 入药镜云：「一日内，十二时； 意所到，皆可为。 」又云：「初结胎，看本命； 终脱胎，看四正。 」此足相发明矣。 ◎乌肝与兔髓、擒来共一处。 一粒复一粒、从微而至着。 乌肝兔髓，坎离之精也，是必擒归一处而后金丹始成。 及乎火运周天，功圆三百，是谓日复一粒，从微至者，婴儿显相，而脱胎神化矣。 ◎混沌包虚空、虚空括三界。 及寻其根源、一粒黍米大。 三界者，欲界色界无色界也，三者皆括于虚空之中，而混沌包之。 混沌者，先天无极也。 丹法神气归根虚无生窍，能以无质之中而生灵质，是虚空括三界也。 脱胎之后，莫不以返于虚无，归于混沌，而后谓之了当，是混沌包虚空也。 然而求其立命之根源，则亦不过一黍玄珠，从微至着耳。 盖黍米之珠，乃无中之有，脱胎神化，复归于无，则圣不可知，而与道为之合真矣。 ◎天地交真液、日月含真精。 会得坎离基、三界归一身。 天地者，阴阳配合之体也，日月者，阴阳互藏之精也，天地交则日月之精合矣，真精合则天地之液行矣。 坎离即日月也，人能会此以立丹基，则宇宙在乎手，万化生乎身，而三界归于一身矣。 三界即上意，皆人身所自有者。 以精用者，则成欲界，以气用者，则成色界。 以神用者，则成无色界。 ◎龙从东海来、虎向西山起。 两兽战一场、化作天地髓。 药物既属坎离，龙虎复为何物。 丹书异名殊字融通，实出一原。 盖坎铅难得，而易于咥人，故象之以虎； 离汞好飞，而难于控御，故象之以龙。 龙从东海来，来而就虎也； 虎从西山起，超而从龙也。 丹法驱龙就虎，驾虎从龙，故此两兽相呑相啖，交战于戊己之宫，则混合和融，化为天地之髓，而还丹可成矣。 其实天地之髓，即坎离之精也，岂有二哉。 ◎金花开汞叶、玉蒂长铅枝。 坎离不曾间、乾坤经几时。 草木花含叶中，蒂生枝上，是皆阴阳互根，相纽相结之妙。 比之丹法，则金华开于汞叶，阴中含阳，坎铅之象也。 玉蒂者，己之命蒂，鄞鄂是也。 命基不能自立，必得真铅合以己汞，然后神气交结而生圣胎，故玉蒂长于铅枝。 惟此阴阳构精，相纽相结，要皆造化之自然。 圣人名之坎离，以泄其互藏之精，象之日月，以取其交光之妙。",
      "translated_text": "The **Zhen (震)** and **Dui (兑)**, **Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)**—these are the four **symbols (象)** of the **Dao (道)**.\nEast, west, south, north—these are the four **symbols'** positions (位)**.\nWhen crafting the **elixir (丹)**, gather and compress the **Five Phases (五行)**, harmonize the four **symbols**, and return them to the **Central Palace (中宫)**, then east, west, south, and north blend into one.\nThus, **Metal (金)** does not dwell in the west,\n**Wood (木)** does not dwell in the east,\n**Fire (火)** does not dwell in the south,\n**Water (水)** does not dwell in the north.\nWhen neither **hexagram (卦)** nor **trigram (爻)** exists, nor their respective positions,\nand one forgets form and obscures symbol,\nit cannot be sought or questioned—\nyet it is named the **elixir (丹)**.\nBut its essence lies in using the **Big Dipper’s handle (斗柄)** to traverse the **Celestial Cycle (周天)**,\nwith **Fire’s conditions (火侯)** fully observed,\nthen the blending and compression may be achieved.\n\nFor the **Celestial Cycle (周天)** is governed by the **Big Dipper (北斗)**, which distributes the **original qi (元气)**.\nAs the **Celestial Cycle** revolves, the **Five Qi (五气)** flow in sequence, completing the year’s work.\nHumans also possess this.\nIf one cannot *\"observe the Dao of Heaven (观天之道), grasp Heaven’s movements (执天之行)\"*,\nand instead seeks the **human gathering and compression (攒簇)**—the **so-called Celestial Pivot (辰极)**—\nhow can one compress and blend to produce the **true elixir of immortality (真乙之丹)**?\n\n◎ **Fire’s conditions (火侯)** do not require set times,\nnor does the **winter solstice (冬至)** necessarily fall on **zi hour (子)**.\nIn the **bathing method (沐浴法)**, at **mao (卯)** and **you (酉)** hours, the **empty comparison (虚比)** occurs.\nFor the **elixir’s Fire’s conditions (金丹火侯)**,\nthe twelve hours from **zi (子)** onward are **yang (阳)**,\nand the twelve hours from **wu (午)** onward are **yin (阴)**.\nWhen **hai (亥)** and **zi (子)** hours meet,\none **yang** returns—this is called the **winter solstice (冬至)**.\nIn the months of **mao (卯)** and **you (酉)**,\n**Wood (木)** and **Metal (金)** qi flourish,\nand the **bathing method (沐浴)** should be applied.\nAt this point, the **principles of yin and yang (阴阳之定理)** and the **numbers of transformation (造化之成数)**\nmust not differ by even a hair’s breadth.\nYet though the **method (法)** is fixed,\nthe **principles (理)** are boundless and flexible—\nits subtleties lie in the practitioner’s mind.\nThus, the **administration of medicines (入药)** and the **ignition of fire (起火)** have their own advances and retreats;\none need not adhere strictly to **zi (子)** and **wu (午)** hours.\nWhen **Zhen (震)** arrives and receives its **talisman (符)**,\nthere is **true faith

months.\nThe **medicine administration (入药)** states:\n*\"Within one day, twelve hours;\nWhere the mind reaches, all may be done.\"*\nIt also says:\n*\"At the initial embryo formation, examine one’s natal **command (本命)**;\nAt the final **shedding of the mortal frame (脱胎)**, observe the **four cardinal directions (四正)**.\"*\nThis fully elucidates the matter.\n\n◎ **Crow’s liver (乌肝)** and

are the **essence of Kan and Li (坎离之精)**;\nthey must be seized and returned to one place\nbefore the **golden elixir (金丹)** can be formed.\nWhen **Fire’s conditions (火)** traverse the **Celestial Cycle (周天)**,\nand the work is complete after **three hundred days (三百)**,\nthis is called **one grain per day (日复一粒)**—\nfrom the subtle to the manifest.\nThe **embryo (婴儿)** reveals its form,\nand the **shedding of the mortal frame (脱胎)** achieves **spiritual transformation (神化)**.\n\n◎ **Chaos (混沌)** embraces the **void (虚空)**,\nthe **void** encompasses the **Three Realms (三界)**.\nYet when seeking its roots,\none finds a **grain of millet (黍米)** in size.\nThe **Three Realms (三界)**—the **Realm of Desire (欲界)**, the **Realm of Form (色界)**, and the **Realm of Formlessness (无色界)**—\nall are contained within the **void (虚空)**,\nand **Chaos (混沌)** embraces them.\n**Chaos (混沌)** is the **preheaven undifferentiated (先天无极)**.\nWhen the **elixir method (丹法)** returns the **spiritual qi (神气)** to its root,\nthe **void (虚无)** gives rise to **orifices (生窍)**,\nand within the **formless (无质)** arises **sacred substance (灵质)**—\nthis is the **void** encompassing the **Three Realms**.\nAfter **shedding of the mortal frame (脱胎)**,\nall return to the **void (虚无)**,\nto **Chaos (混沌)**,\nand are then called **accomplished (了当)**—\nthis is **Chaos** embracing the **void**.\nYet when seeking the **foundation of one’s life (立命之根源)**,\nit is still just a **grain-sized Dark Pearl (一黍玄珠)**,\nfrom the subtle to the manifest.\nFor the **grain of millet (黍米)**,\nit is the **having within the none (无中之有)**;\nwhen **shedding of the mortal frame (脱胎)** achieves **spiritual transformation (神化)**,\nit returns once more to the **none (无)**—\nthen the **sage (圣人)** is beyond knowing,\nand the **Way (道)** is truly united.\n\n◎ When **Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)** interact, **true fluid (真液)** emerges;\nwhen **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)** contain **true essence (真精)**.\nIf one grasps the **foundation of Kan and Li (坎离基)**,\nthen the **Three Realms (三界)** return to one body.\n**Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)** are the **body of yin and yang’s union (阴阳配合之体)**,\nwhile **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)** are the **essence of yin and yang’s mutual concealment (阴阳互藏之精)**.\nWhen **Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)** interact,\nthe **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)**’s essences merge—\n**true essence (真精)** merges, then **Heaven (天)** and **Earth (地)**’s **true fluid (真液)** flows.\n**Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)** are the **Sun (日)** and **Moon (月)**;\nif humans grasp this to establish the **elixir’s foundation (丹基)**,\nthen the **cosmos lies within the hand (宇宙在乎手)**,\nand **transformation arises from the body (万化生乎身)**—\nthus the **Three Realms (三界)** return to one body.\nThe **Three Realms (三界)** are the **upper, middle, and lower (上中下)**,\nall inherently possessed by the human body.\nUsing **essence (精)** achieves the **Realm of Desire (欲界)**,\nusing **qi (气)** achieves the **Realm of Form (色界)**,\nusing **spirit (神)** achieves the **Realm of Formlessness (无色界)**.\n\n◎ The **Dragon (龙)** emerges from the **Eastern Sea (东海)**,\nthe **Tiger (虎)** rises from the **Western Mountain (西山)**.\nThe two beasts wage war in one battle,\ntransforming into **Heaven and Earth’s marrow (天地髓)**.\nSince the **medicines (药物)** belong to **Kan (坎)** and **Li (离)**,\nwhat are the **Dragon (龙)** and **Tiger (虎)**?\nThe **elixir scriptures (丹书)** blend varied names and characters,\nyet they originate from one source.\nFor **Kan (坎)**’s **Lead (铅)** is hard to obtain,\nyet easy to **devour (咥)** humans—\nthus it is symbolized by the **Tiger (虎)**;\n**Li (离)**’s **Mercury (汞)** is fond of **fleeing (飞)**,\nyet hard to **control (控御)**—\nthus it is symbolized by the **Dragon (龙)**.\nThe **Dragon (龙)** comes from the **Eastern Sea (东海)**,\nand then **subdues the Tiger (就虎)**;\nThe **Tiger (虎)** rises from the **Western Mountain (西山)**,\nand then **follows the Dragon (超而从龙)**.\nThe **elixir method (丹法)** drives the **Dragon (龙)** to subdue the **Tiger (虎)**,\nand harnesses the **Tiger (虎)** to follow the **Dragon (龙)**.\nThus these two beasts **devour and are devoured (相呑相啖)**,\nclashing in the **pentagon (戊己之宫)**,\nthen blending and merging harmoniously—\ntransforming into **Heaven and Earth’s marrow (天地髓)**,\nand thus the **returned elixir (还丹)** may be
