  "full_translation": "**Title:** *The Oral Precepts of the Great Daoist Elixir of Gold*\n\n**Source:** *Oral Precepts of the Great Daoist Elixir of Gold* (經名：*金液大丹口诀*)\nTransmitted by the White-Garbed Daoist, annotated by Zheng De’an (靜寧真子鄭德安序).\nLikely originating from the Song or Yuan dynasties.\nOne scroll.\nFound in: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon* (《正統道藏》), *Dongzhen* (洞真) section, *Miscellaneous Alchemy* (眾術類).\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Oral Precepts of the Great Daoist Elixir of Gold**\nTransmitted by the White-Garbed Daoist of Taowei Cavern (太微洞天白衣道者) to Zheng De’an, the Master of Serene and Mysterious Stillness (冲虚妙静宁真子).\n\nTo seek **Daoist** transcendence (修真), one must exhaustively explore **principle** (理) and **nature** (性), extending even to the **fate** (命)—thus it may be achieved.\nWhen **nature** (性) is yet unclear, **fate** (命) cannot be known.\nHence, the **Buddhist** school (釋氏) regards **nature** as the primary essence (主), while **fate** is its attendant (伴);\nThe **Supreme One** (太上) holds **fate** as the primary essence (主), with **nature** as its attendant (伴).\nThese two doctrines are most profound:\nFor those who take **nature** as the primary essence (主), they must first clarify the state before one’s parents gave birth to oneself—what was it then?\nHaving pierced through all phenomena and all illusions (萬境萬緑悉－皆看破),\none realizes that only this **point of pristine, empty, and luminous essence** (此個一點虚靈) is the primary essence (主),\nand that this very body is also **empty and illusory** (虚幻).\nIf such is the case, then in the final stage (末後一着),\nhow does one **settle and return** (作么收拾回去)?\nThe **Buddha** (佛) says:\n*\"The ultimate step (向上一着) is something the thousand sages (千聖) do not impart.\"*\n\nThe adept who attains this is called the **Six Transcendental Liberties** (六通無礙六自在如來). Without this step, one remains a stubborn void (顽空).\n\nThe Ancestral Master says:\n*\"Though you may penetrate the true nature (真如性),\nyou still risk abandoning the body only to re-enter it.\nFrom now on, you must further refine the Great Elixir (大藥),\nsuddenly transcending imperfection (無漏) to become a True Person (真人).\"*\n\nFor those who follow the **Supreme One’s** teaching of **fate** as the primary essence (主),\none must first practice **hollow-stomach cultivation** (實腹養身),\npreserve essence to generate **blackness** (保精生黑),\ntransform **blackness** into **spirit** (以黑化神),\nand merge **spirit** with the **Dao** (以神合道).\nEven then, one may still achieve **freedom in movement** (纵横猶得),\ngrow as a **jade tree** (長以玉樹),\nwith branches, stems, flowers, and leaves flourishing in abundance (枝茎花葉，茂盛之喻).\nThrough alchemical refinement (工夫鍛煉),\none’s essence becomes **pure yang** (純陽為體),\na body within the body (身外有身),\nwith myriad transformations (千千變化)—\npiercing metal, traversing stone (穿金透石),\nmanifesting all manner of **spiritual powers** (現種種之神通).\nWhat difference is there from the Buddha?\n\nThe two terms, **nature** and **fate**, cannot be split as two,\nnor can they be conflated as one.\nThus, the **Immortal’s** alchemical elixir (金液大丹) is a wondrous secret (妙訣),\nthe **Golden Chest and Jade Bamboo** (金箱玉笋) passed down through ten thousand kalpas (萬劫一傳).\n\nThe *Mystic Canon* (《玄科》） states:\n*\"If one reveals this to the unworthy, the Heavenly Dao is sealed.\nIf one carelessly transmits to the unfit, Heaven’s treasure is spilled.\nTo leak it lightly is to invite slow death—\nthe Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors will judge in the underworld (冥考).\"*\n\nMaster **Bo Yang** (伯陽祖師) said:\n*\"I dare not lightly speak of this with those who possess the kidney essence (窃與腎者談),\nlest I write of it on bamboo or silk (寫情記竹帛),\nfor fear of revealing Heaven’s decree (泄天符).\nIf I were to speak recklessly, my tongue would fester,\nthe Dao would be sealed, and I would face execution (閉道獲罪誅).\nThough it may be transmitted orally (可以口訣),\nit cannot be written down (難以書傳).*\nReflect deeply—no need for further debate.\nGuard it in silence, do not transmit it in writing (深藏守，莫傳文).\"\n\nMaster **Ping Shu** (平叔祖師) said:\n*\"In my past, I transmitted this three times to others,\nand three times met with calamity.\nFrom now on, I shall seal my lips and close my tongue.\nEven if the cauldron is before me and the blade at my neck,\nI shall dare not speak again!\"*\n\nI ponder this: if all under Heaven were to grasp this Dao,\nhow should such strict observance be upheld?\nThough one has received transmission from a teacher,\nleaks are inevitable—\neven if one’s bones are ground to powder and body shattered,\nit is difficult to repay the teacher’s virtue (師德).\nThe Master said:\n*\"One who transmits the Dao benefits nine generations of ancestors.\nThe **Supreme One’s** enduring wish for longevity\nshall not be cut off by force.\"*\n\nThus, I composed the **Sixty-Four-Character Oral Precepts** (六十四句口訣),\ntitled *The Supreme One’s Direct Pointer to the True Fire Symbol in Seven-Character Verse* (《太一含真火符直指七言詩》) seventeen stanzas,\nand *The One-Catty Gold* (《一秤金》), *The Western River Moon* (《西江月》) six stanzas,\naligned with the **Pure Heaven** (純乾) hexagram.\nWithin, all essential techniques are encompassed:\nthe **alchemical openings** (下手工夫玄),\nthe **single orifice** (關一竅),\nthe **sources of medicines and minerals** (藥物川源),\nthe **fire alchemy** (火候),\nthe **secret principles** (秘旨),\nthe **refinement and withdrawal** (進退抽添),\nthe **ritual bathing, nourishment, and spirit transformation** (沐浴溫養脫胎神化)—\nall are thoroughly detailed.\n\nThis is what I have personally attained through practice.\nI hope scholars will diligently refine their efforts,\nseeing daily results.\nAfter verification, one must:\n- **Measure the daily progress** (消息拟時),\n- **Distinguish clarity and turbidity** (要準辨),\n- **Recognize stagnation and vitality** (認浮沉),\n- **Discern obscurity and luminosity** (識昏明),\n- **Know the early and late stages** (知早晚),\n- **Avoid drowsiness** (莫瞌睡),\n- **Regulate diet and drink** (節飲食).\nWhen the alchemical work is complete,\n**descend to receive** (降則取),\n**ascend to welcome** (升則迎),\n**forge into a radiant mass** (打成團),\nand **emit luminous clarity** (發光明).\n\n「The **Dao** is subtle and continuous—yet free from great excess;\n**Qi** rages wildly—then fear of deficiency arises.\n\nAcquiring it is no easy task, practicing it is no easy task,\nbut preserving it is the most difficult of all.\n\nWith the labor of ten months’ toil,\none may forever enjoy boundless ease.\n\nYet few know who is truly decisive and bold,\nwho reaches profound compassion,\nor who understands the **Dao** and attains it.\n\nThose who practice it silently,\nwith every word in harmony,\nshall fulfill their wish for **virtue** and tranquility.\n\nIf one encounters a master’s precepts,\nwhether sincere or not,\nwhether practiced or neglected,\nwhether diligent or slack—\nthen it is not the fault of **virtue** and tranquility.\n\nI swear by the **Dao**:\nIf I, a future sage, fail to teach others,\nI shall bear the **Dao’s** judgment through countless kalpas.\n\nShould any who read this text\ngrow careless or negligent,\nthey will forever become lower ghosts,\nand their misfortune shall extend to the Nine **Abysses**.\nLet scholars take heed!\n\n**The Golden Elixir’s Oral Precepts**\n\nThe precepts say:\nAt age nineteen, I sought my master,\nand met the **Most Authentic** Old White-Browed Sage.\nIn one word, he pointed out the **Mysterious Pass** (玄关窍),\nyet few grasp its essence or absence.\n\nUpon returning with the **Pass**,\nI focused solely on **inner vision**,\nfor the Yellow Nurse lies within these very realms.\nNow I dare not shirk the **Dao’s** retribution—\nI reveal this to those who seek immortality.\n\nBeneath the heart, above the kidneys, in the high center,\nwhere the **Hairy Buddha** (髻佛) serves as foundation,\ndo not cling to mere forms and fabricate actions—\ninstead, **concentrate** and **settle** the spirit’s essence.\n\nWhen practicing, sit cross-legged in **great stillness**,\nforgetting all worldly dust, fixing the gaze downward.\nLet the breath flow softly and **refine** itself—\nif it does not settle, even by a hair’s breadth.\n\nOnce this stage is reached, all thoughts must cease,\nfor if the mind still stirs, **qi** and spirit will depart.\nEndure as if your body were falling into a thousand pieces,\naccept life or death without hesitation or doubt.\n\nSuddenly, the hundred vessels gather **qi**,\nand the heart grows dim as strength wanes.\nThe **Golden Elixir** fills the mouth in gentle waves—\nthen a cool breeze stirs at the crown of the head.\n\nWithin the center, a single **Dao**-channel of heat surges,\nuntil it reaches the **Tail Vein** (尾闻), where it transforms into **Yin**.\nFierce and ascending, it pierces the **Kunlun Peak**,\nand coalesces into a single **jewel-like pearl** suspended there.\n\nIt descends steadily, clear as snow pear—\nthen drips into the **Jade Pool**,\nwhere the **Elixir** is gently guided to its proper course.\n\nPassing through layered chambers into the **Earthen Furnace** (土釜),\nthe **Red Lotus** contains its essence, a marvelous sight.\nWith **intent**, send it into the **Golden Cauldron** (黄金鼎),\nwhere the fire ignites without human aid.\n\nThis is the **Dao’s** natural true fire—\nwhen it arises, its timing is known to few.\nAn instant’s **elixir** yields an instant’s harvest,\na moment’s fire brings a moment’s revelation.\n\nThousands of scriptures and treatises record it not—\nnow I disclose it, yet wish you to keep it secret.\n\nEach day, the **One Yang** (一阳) rises and subsides,\nso **advance the fire** without delay.\nNo other method need be considered—\nonly guide the heart’s **intent** to welcome it.\n\nIf the fire is **forceful**, let the heart be **forceful**;\nif the fire is **gentle**, let the **intent** follow suit.\n\nGradually, **Mercury** dries as **Lead** is exhausted,\n**refinement and withdrawal** mirror the waxing and waning phases.\n**Ritual bathing** must avoid the **Mao** and **You** months,\nfor adding fire then would risk collapse.\n\nOnce this stage is reached, **regulate** the **qi** to preserve and guard,\nand beyond it, act with caution.\n\nIn ten months, **conception and nourishment** take form,\nand on that day, a **sage’s** appearance reveals itself.\n\nTheir countenance is identical—no two are alike—\nonly then does the **Dao’s** wondrous **virtue** fully manifest.\n\nOne final word I entrust to you:\nDo not abandon **spirit transformation** (脱胎) in reckless haste.\nIf the **spirit** departs too soon, it cannot wander freely.\nWait until the **Three Thousand Practices** (三千功) are complete,\nthen enter the **Jade Emperor’s** **Celestial Court** (玉皇下韶) and ascend to the **Elixir Platform** (丹墀).\n\n**Seventeen Verses on Initial Practice**\n\n**First Sitting:**\nSit cross-legged in **great stillness** for half a year,\nthen cultivate **purity and tranquility**, severing all dusty ties.\nAfterward, apply my **True and Wondrous Precepts**,\nwith sincere devotion and single-minded focus on the **Central Field** (中田).\n\n**Initial Practice:**\n**Concentrate** the spirit and **settle** the will within the **Yellow Palace** (黄宫),\nas the hundred **vessels** (百豚) ascend to the **Celestial Source** (朝元).\nHeavy as a mountain, pure as rain,\nthe fire surges forth in an instant.\n\n**When the Practice is Complete:**\nFrom **Great Ultimate** (太极), formless **qi** is born,\nand silently, **one qi** transforms into **Yin and Yang**.\nWithin the clear, **Yin** descends from Heaven,\nwhile **Yin**-enfolded **Yin** reveals the **Red** from Earth.\n\n**Fire’s Timing:**\nThe **Sages** pass down medicines but not fire,\nfor few have ever known its proper measure.\nNow I reveal Heaven’s **Dao**-secret:\nthe fire’s first stir begins at **Child Hour** (子时).\n\n**Measuring Time and Clarity:**\nWithin the furnace, a **flame** blazes red—\nalso welcome it with the heart into the **Earthen Palace** (土宫).\nEach day, the **One Yang** must be **regulated**—\ndo not err, lest your **Dao**-labor be wasted.\n\n**Medicine and Its Manifestations:**\nBefore the **One** (守一), the furnace’s **seed** sprouts,\nas **Cinnabar** (朱砂) in the **Golden Cauldron** glows bright.\nWithin the **Central Palace**, the **Jade Elixir** drips steadily,\nwhile the **Luminous Moon** hangs in the sky, purifying the **qi**.\n\n**Ascension and Descension, Binding and Uniting:**\n**Water** issues from the **High Source**, descending to **Jade Capital** (玉京),\nwhile **Fire** arises from the **Earthly Gate**, emitting **Luminous Clarity**.\nWith each ascension and descension, it returns to the **Central Earth** (中土),\nand when bound, it forms a **clustered** **Yin** within the **Abyss** (坎).\n\n**Refinement and Withdrawal’s Marvelous Use:**\n**Mercury** returns to the **Golden Cauldron** as **Lead** lies hidden,\nwhile **Lead** emerges from the **Jade Furnace** as **Mercury** dissipates.\nThe **two substances**’ presence or absence yield the **Ultimate Treasure**,\nfor their **refinement and withdrawal**’s **Dao**-law naturally transcends.\n\n**Stagnation and Vitality, Ritual Bathing:**\nThe cause of **ritual bathing** lies in two subtle **intents**,\nand practitioners must not contravene its timing.\nLet the **True Qi** permeate and **nourish** the body’s every part,\nthen **one qi**’s **stagnation and vitality** shall harmonize.\n\n**The Purple River Cart:**\n**Nourishing** the **Original Spirit** with **qi** and **essence**,\nthe **Purple River Cart** moves like a windmill.\nThe **plashing** of water echoes within the **Flowering Pool** (华池),\nwhile **radiant** gold light suffuses the body, bringing **Spring Vitality** (体春).\n\n**Gathering and Scattering, Transformation:**\nThe **shortening** arises when the **two substances** unite,\nwhile **lengthening** disperses as the **form** returns.\nWhen **Yang** exhausts, **Mercury** dries up—all ceases.\nWait until the **Full Cycle** (周天) reignites its **Dao**-mechanism.\n\n**Nurturing the Qi-Mother:**\nThe **Golden Womb** (金胎) and **Spirit Chamber** (神室) reside in the **Central Palace** (中官),\nwhether present or absent, **practice** must accumulate.\nIn three months, its form resembles an **orange**,\nand in a year, its **refinement** reaches the **Heavenly Red** (亘天红).\n\n**A Hundred Days’ Foundation:**\nWithin ten **decades** (旬), **refine** with caution and **fullness**,\ngradually sensing the **fragrance of chrysanthemum** (菊馨) at the furnace’s edge.\nNow it is half-formed—**progress** is evident—\nso tread lightly and await its emergence into the **Yellow Court** (黄庭).\n\n**Days to Avoid for Ritual Bathing:**\nIn the **Mao** and **You** months, **open** your **womb**,\nand **preserve** the **Sacred Embryo** without stirring the fire.\nWhen ten months’ **refinement** is complete, **Luminous Clarity** pierces the body,\nand the **Heavenly Gate** blazes open, splitting the **nape** (项).\n\n**Transferring Spirit and Exchanging the Nape.**»\n\n**The Daoist Alchemical Ascension**\n\nThe **Waxing Moon** shifts the spirit straight upward—\nonce the **Three Passes** are pierced, **Spiritual Clarity** flows.\nThe **Celestial Maiden** gazes upward at **Kunlun’s Peak**,\npiercing the **Yellow Court** to enter the **Purple Palace**.\n\n**Nurturing the Embryonic Immortal**\nWhen **qi** is full, the **Divine Embryo** enters the **Purple Palace**,\nand for three years, it must be **warmly nourished** with **composure**.\nIf even a thread of **mundane desire** intervenes,\nthe **Path to Penglai** vanishes in ten thousand layers.\n\n**Natural Transfiguration**\nAfter nine years, the **Outer Body** is **lifted**—\nnow **entering and exiting** is no longer under one’s control.\nWhen the **Decree is fulfilled**, the **Celestial Summons** arrives,\nand the **Crane-Carriage** glides gracefully to the **Purple Court**.\n\n---\n\n**Six *West River Moon* Poems**\n\nThe **One Yang** is fully peeled—**Returning Rebirth** begins,\n**Warmly** nurturing the **Soul-Spring** from the **Well’s Depth**.\n**White Snow** descends in endless flurries across the **Heavenly Expanse**,\nwhile the **Immortal** feasts in the **Jade Pavilion**.\n\nSuddenly, the **Yellow Court’s Herald** reports—\nthe **Emerald Maiden** has arrived at the **Palace Gate**.\nThe two meet and **seal their bond with green vows**,\nknowing no mortal may witness this union.\n\nWhen the **Two Yangs** arrive, the **Summons** must be hastened—\nthe **Golden Sage** is urgently invoked.\nThe three reunite in the **Yellow Palace**,\nsharing **Grace and Virtue** in joyous harmony.\nThey drink **Dragon’s Blood** and **Tiger’s Marrow**,\nsavoring **fragrant wine** from the **Celestial Vessel**.\nSuch **wealth and honor** belong to the **Daoist Sage**,\nfar surpassing the pleasures of mortal opulence.\n\nSuddenly, the **Three Yangs** harmonize—\n**Misty vapors** fill the cosmos, spring reborn.\nThe **Land prospers**, the **Nation thrives**—**New Year’s blessings** abound,\nand all beneath the **Heavenly Vault** rejoice.\nUnbeknownst, the **Lantern Festival** arrives,\nas the **Imperial Court** illuminates the **Flowering Lanterns**.\nChildren and elders alike **secretly exult**,\nremembering the **Moon’s Fullness**—\nwhen **Heaven’s Thunder** roared, **Great Boldness** descended,\nand all **feared** to **cultivate the self**.\n**Mountains shrouded in qi-vapors** steamed,\nas **Bathing in the Void** brought **Purity and Stillness**.\nOnly the **Wise** perceive this truth—\nthen they must **grasp the Essentials of the True Ones**.\n\nWhen **Yin and Yang** reach this **equilibrium**,\nthe **Eight Trigrams’ Virtue and Penalty** align.\nThe **Old Yang** expels the **Young Maiden**,\nand the **entire clan** becomes **male**.\nWhen the **Five Phases** and **Four Symbols** flourish,\n**Wealth and Honor** arise from this **auspice**.\nThe **Central Palace** is **gilded with gold**,\nits **stairs** paved with **layers of jade**.\nMoreover, within the **body** lies the **Diamond**—\ncomparable to **Yuanshi’s Suspended Pearl**.\nIn **Pure Summer’s Fourth Month**, the **Flowering Pool’s** old blossoms bloom anew,\nas **Golden Waves** reflect the **Lunar Tower**,\nand **Pearl Dew** drips from the **Lotus**, worthy of love.\n**Heaven’s Natural Transformation** must be **guided by Divine Movement**—\n**Void-Cultivation’s Practice** is the **strange marvel**,\nunfathomable to the common mind.\n\n---\n\n**Song of Ease**\n\nDo you not see?\nIn the **Easeful Nest**, the **idle man** seeks neither wealth nor fame,\nbut **finds the Existent** within the **None**—\nonly when he **discerns True from False** does he **awaken**.\n\nThe **Dao** is originally **dim and vague**,\nyet **Yin and Yang** restraining each other **give rise to things**.\nThe **scholar**, **foolish and confused**, knows not—\nthrough **ten thousand histories** and **a thousand scriptures**, he **finds no answer**.\n\nWhen the **Clear Teacher** appears,\nand **directly points to the secret**—\nit lies in the **eyebrows and eyelashes**.\nTo reach the **High Peak** in an instant,\nwithout it, one **wanders in vain**.\n\n**Establish the Furnace**, **root the Foundation**—\n**Mercury** hides in **Receptive**, **Lead** in **Creative**.\nThe two **unite** in the **Earthen Tripod**,\nwith **Yellow Mother** as the **matchmaker**, **perfectly paired**.\n\nThis **substance** is **nowhere to be found**—\nonly the **Mysterious and Subtle** may recognize it.\n**One’s own labor** is **one’s own harvest**,\nno **tyrant’s force** can **plunder it**.\n\nAll have **qi, essence, and spirit**—\nnot **cinnabar** nor **mercury**.\nIn the **Crescent Furnace**, **fire is constantly fed**,\nuntil the **Golden Essence** is **refined to a single jin**.\n\nWith the **Root secured**, why **fear the branches**?\n**Effortless and unbounded**, **naturally at ease**,\n**Adverse and favorable**—the **body itself** aligns.\nWhen **Symbols are grasped**, **words are forgotten**, and **True Awakening** dawns.\n\nMen laugh at my **poverty**, yet I am not poor—\nhow can the **body** be poor when the **Dao** is not?\nThe **Mysterious Pearl**, my **precious friend**,\nnurtured in the **Dan Field**, is **beyond price**.\n\n**Empty yet not empty**, **form yet not form**—\n**Transformation’s Cycle** knows **no end**.\nIf asked how this is done,\nI cannot **share it** with you.\n\n**Wasting the Spirit**, **exhausting effort**—\nthe **fate of the shallow** is **unfathomable**.\nThey **know not** **South from North**, nor **East from West**,\nnor can they **distinguish** **Green from Yellow**, **Qi from White**.\n\n**Washing in the Sweet Spring**, **cleansing filth**—\neven **Immortal Adepts** were once **common folk**.\nThe **Marvelous Use** is **clear before one’s eyes**,\nyet the **path is rugged**, the **journey far**.\n\n**Guest becomes Host**, **Host becomes Guest**—\n**Guest and Host** regard each other, **ever closer**.\n**Discussing the Dao-Canon** relies on **oral precepts**,\nand within lies the **natural truth**.\n\n**Preserve the Mind**, **nurture the Nature**—\nwhen **Nature is preserved**, the **Mind is naturally correct**.\n**Non-action in action**, **nothing left undone**—\nall **phenomena forgotten**, the **Spirit responds**.\n\n**True or False**, **False or True**—\n**True-False-False-True** twists into **delusion**.\nThe **unawakened** fail to **grasp the Primordial Principle**,\nwhile the **Enlightened** ascend to **Taiwei’s Heights**.\n\nWhen the **fish is caught**, why **keep the net**?\nWhen the **river is crossed**, why **retain the raft**?\nThe **Song of Ease in the Easeful Nest**—\nthis is the **Secret of Eternal Life**.\n\n---\n\n**The *Return-to-Truth* Essay for Later Learners**\n\nThe **Dao is the Mind**, the **Mind is the Dao**—\nthe **Dao arises from the Mind**, the **Mind has the Dao**.\nThrough **Mind**, the **Dao is illuminated**; through the **Dao**, the **Mind is awakened**.\nThe **Mind gives rise to Nature**, the **Nature follows the Mind**.\n\nThis **Nature** is the **True Nature**—\n**neither born nor extinguished**, **neither coming nor going**,\n**neither increasing nor decreasing**,\n**thus and such**, **naturally luminous and penetrating**,\n**round and free**, the **Great Void** itself.\n\n**Transformation and Response** are called **Spirit**—\nits **origin** is such that **Spirit without Mind cannot stand**,\n**Mind without qi cannot form**,\n**qi without essence cannot manifest**, **essence without qi cannot generate**;\n**qi without Spirit cannot move**, **Spirit without qi cannot act**;\n**qi without essence cannot settle**, **essence without Spirit cannot congeal**;\n**Spirit without Mind cannot be guarded**, **Mind without Spirit cannot be alert**.\n\nThe **Spirit’s alertness**—\n**swift yet not hasty**, **arrives yet not sought**,\n**transformation beyond measure**, **naturally so**,\nyet **unknowable in its so-ness**.\n\nI know the **wondrous functions of Mind and Spirit**!\nThus, **Bodhidharma** came from the West,\n**not establishing scriptures**,\n**facing the wall for nine years**,\n**directly pointing to the Mind**—\n**seeing Nature and becoming Buddha** is this.\n\nThis **Mind** is not the **thinking, scheming, imagined heart**,\nbut the **Heavenly Heart**, the **Heart within Man**.\n\nIn the human body to seek it,\none must not seek it elsewhere.\n\nEncountering the Sage of the highest order,\none cannot hear nor see it unless divinely granted.\nThough one may encounter such a Sage,\nand he teaches in secret,\nif one does not cultivate the **self-downward** stillness and refinement of **gongfu**,\neven in the **Great Death Field** recognizing it clearly,\none still may not know it.\n\nOnce known, truly known,\nonce awakened—\none from this **has** the Dao,\ntwo from this **obtains** the Way,\nthree from this **generates** the ten thousand things,\nand **creates** boundless transformation!\n\nThus, Buddhas, immortals, and sages,\nprofoundly understanding the **Great Dao**,\npenetrating the **Heavenly Heart**,\nmastering the **yin-yang** transformations,\nand perceiving the **wondrous principles** and **mystic mechanisms**,\nall derive from this **Mind**.\n\nThe **Mind** of the sage,\nthe **Mind** of the common man—\nin truth, it is but **one Mind**.\nThose who awaken become sages,\nthose who remain lost are common.\n\nAlas!\nThe **Dao is near yet sought afar**,\nthe matter is easy yet pursued with difficulty—\nwhy so?\n\nThe **True Suchness** of wondrous Nature,\neach individual **perfectly complete**,\nyet through **greed** and **attachment**,\nthey are nowhere to be found.\n\nA **true man** must be resolute and bold,\ndirectly assuming responsibility—\nto grasp these words,\nto apply oneself thus,\nand **align with the Dao**—this is authenticity!\n\n**Poetic Insight** to the **Mystic Gateway**:\nPlucking the **hundred veins** of meaning,\n**True Lead** at the ocean’s depths releases **golden light**,\n**Spirit returns** to the **Chaos of Primordium**,\n**Mystic Elixir** atop the mountain becomes **jade nectar**.\nThe **Great Elixir** of **Golden Liquid**—\nthe **oral formula** of the **Great Alchemy** is complete.",

profound compassion,\nor who understands the **Dao** and attains it.\n\nThose who practice it silently,\nwith every word in harmony,\nshall fulfill their wish for **virtue** and tranquility.\n\nIf one encounters a master’s precepts,\nwhether sincere or not,\nwhether practiced or neglected,\nwhether diligent or slack—\nthen it is not the fault of **virtue** and tranquility.\n\nI swear by the **Dao**:\nIf I, a future sage, fail to teach others,\nI shall bear the **Dao’s** judgment through countless kalpas.\n\nShould any who read this text\ngrow careless or negligent,\nthey will forever

**Pass**,\nI focused solely on **inner vision**,\nfor the Yellow Nurse lies within these very realms.\nNow I dare not shirk the **Dao’s** retribution—\nI reveal this to those who seek immortality.\n\nBeneath the heart, above the kidneys, in the high center,\nwhere the **Hairy Buddha** (髻佛) serves as foundation,\ndo not cling to mere forms and fabricate actions—\ninstead, **concentrate** and **settle** the spirit’s essence.\n\nWhen practicing, sit cross-legged in **great stillness**,\nforgetting all worldly dust, fixing the gaze downward.\nLet the breath flow softly and **refine** itself—\nif it does not settle, even by a hair’s breadth.\n\nOnce this stage is reached, all thoughts must cease,\nfor if the mind still stirs, **qi** and spirit will depart.\nEndure as if your body were falling into a thousand pieces,\naccept life or death without hesitation or doubt.\n\nSuddenly, the hundred vessels gather **qi**,\nand the heart grows dim as strength wanes.\nThe **Golden Elixir** fills the mouth in gentle waves—\nthen a cool breeze stirs at the crown of the head.\n\nWithin the center, a single **Dao**-channel of heat surges,\nuntil it reaches the **Tail Vein** (尾闻), where it transforms into **Yin**.\nFierce and ascending, it pierces the **Kunlun Peak**,\nand coalesces into a single **jewel-like pearl** suspended there.\n\nIt descends steadily, clear as snow pear—\nthen drips into the **Jade Pool**,\nwhere the **Elixir** is gently guided to its proper course.\n\nPassing through layered chambers into the **Earthen Furnace** (土釜),\nthe **Red Lotus** contains its essence, a marvelous sight.\nWith **intent**, send it into the **Golden Cauldron** (黄金鼎),\nwhere the fire ignites without human aid.\n\nThis is the **Dao’s** natural true fire—\nwhen it arises, its timing is known to few.\nAn instant’s **elixir** yields an instant’s harvest,\na moment’s fire brings a moment’s revelation.\n\nThousands of scriptures and treatises record it not—\nnow I disclose it, yet wish you to keep it secret.\n\nEach day, the **One Yang** (一阳) rises and subsides,\nso **advance the fire** without delay.\nNo other method need be considered—\nonly guide the heart’s **intent** to welcome it.\n\nIf the fire is **forceful**, let the heart be **forceful**;\nif the fire is **gentle**, let the **intent** follow suit.\n\nGradually, **Mercury** dries as **Lead** is exhausted,\n**refinement and withdrawal** mirror the waxing and waning phases.\n**Ritual bathing** must avoid the **Mao** and **You** months,\nfor adding fire then would risk collapse.\n\nOnce this stage is reached, **regulate** the **qi** to preserve and guard,\nand beyond it, act with caution.\n\nIn ten months, **conception and nourishment** take form,\nand on that day, a **sage’s** appearance reveals itself.\n\nTheir countenance is identical—no two are alike—\nonly then does the **Dao’s** wondrous **virtue** fully manifest.\n\nOne final word I entrust to you:\nDo not abandon **spirit transformation** (脱胎) in reckless haste.\nIf the **spirit** departs too soon, it cannot wander freely.\nWait until the **Three Thousand Practices** (三千功) are complete,\nthen enter the **Jade Emperor’s** **Celestial Court** (玉皇下韶) and ascend to the **Elixir Platform** (丹墀).\n\n**Seventeen Verses on Initial Practice**\n\n**First Sitting:**\nSit cross-legged in **great stillness** for half a year,\nthen cultivate **purity and tranquility**, severing all dusty ties.\nAfterward, apply my **True and Wondrous Precepts**,\nwith sincere devotion and single-minded focus on the **Central Field** (中田).\n\n**Initial Practice:**\n**Concentrate** the spirit and **settle** the will within the **Yellow Palace** (黄宫),\nas the hundred **vessels** (百豚) ascend to the **Celestial Source** (朝元).\nHeavy as a mountain, pure as rain,\nthe fire surges forth in an instant.\n\n**When the Practice is Complete:**\nFrom **Great Ultimate** (太极), formless **qi** is born,\nand silently, **one qi** transforms into **Yin and Yang**.\nWithin the clear, **Yin** descends from Heaven,\nwhile **Yin**-enfolded **Yin** reveals the **Red** from Earth.\n\n**Fire’s Timing:**\nThe **Sages** pass down medicines but not fire,\nfor few have ever known its proper measure.\nNow I reveal Heaven’s **Dao**-secret:\nthe fire’s first stir begins at **Child Hour** (子时).\n\n**Measuring Time and Clarity:**\nWithin the furnace, a **flame** blazes red—\nalso welcome it with the heart into the **Earthen Palace** (土宫).\nEach day, the **One Yang** must be **regulated**—\ndo not err, lest your **Dao**-labor be wasted.\n\n**Medicine and Its Manifestations:**\nBefore the **One** (守一), the furnace’s **seed** sprouts,\nas **Cinnabar** (朱砂) in the **Golden Cauldron** glows bright.\nWithin the **Central Palace**, the **Jade Elixir** drips steadily,\nwhile the **Luminous Moon** hangs in the sky, purifying the **qi**.\n\n**Ascension and Descension, Binding and Uniting:**\n**Water** issues from the **High Source**, descending to **Jade Capital** (玉京),\nwhile **Fire** arises from the **Earthly Gate**, emitting **Luminous Clarity**.\nWith each ascension and descension, it returns to the **Central Earth** (中土),\nand when bound, it forms a **clustered** **Yin** within the **Abyss** (坎).\n\n**Refinement and Withdrawal’s Marvelous Use:**\n**Mercury** returns to the **Golden Cauldron** as **Lead** lies hidden,\nwhile **Lead** emerges from the **Jade Furnace** as **Mercury** dissipates.\nThe **two substances**’ presence or absence yield the **Ultimate Treasure**,\nfor their **refinement and withdrawal**’s **Dao**-law naturally transcends.\n\n**Stagnation and Vitality, Ritual Bathing:**\nThe cause of **ritual bathing** lies in two subtle **intents**,\nand practitioners must not contravene its timing.\nLet the **True Qi** permeate and **nourish** the body’s every part,\nthen **one qi**’s **stagnation and vitality** shall harmonize.\n\n**The Purple River Cart:**\n**Nourishing** the
