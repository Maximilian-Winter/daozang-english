  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Method of the Golden Mother of Highest Clarity for Seeking Immortality**\n\n*Scripture Title:* The Supreme Method of the Golden Mother of Highest Clarity for Seeking Immortality\n*Composed by:* Li Xuanzhen, Daoist of Mount Lu, Tang Dynasty\n*Compiled and translated from talismanic scripts in the* Scripture of Numinous Treasure\n\nOne scroll. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Section of Mysterious Cavern*, *Category of Spirit Talismans*.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Method of the Golden Mother of Highest Clarity for Seeking Immortality**\n*Expounded by* Li Xuanzhen of Mount Lu\n\nThe Queen Mother of Highest Clarity addressed the Supreme Lord of the Dao, saying: \"I humbly inquire—within the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure*, there exist talismanic diagrams and written texts. Their script is arcane and concealed, and I have not yet received their instruction. Day and night, I revere and gaze upon them, yet dare not presume to approach the numinous countenance.\n\nThough I am unworthy and dwell in the office of Governing Perfection, I have not yet discerned the talismanic formulae. Might they be transmitted to me now? If I could be enlightened in what I have not yet heard, it would be as though I were lifted from obscurity, and my destiny would unfold naturally.\"\n\nThe Lord of the Dao replied: \"The texts of the *Numinous Treasure* originated in the Dragon Han era and have endured to this day, passing through kalpas as numerous as grains of sand. The talismanic diagrams are treasured and secret, their script profound and obscure. In ancient times, the Primordial Beginning refined the true script with fire, causing it to gleam and radiate. Once the script became manifest, I came to understand it.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning then commanded the Five Elders to assist in guarding the talismanic formulae of the Five True Scripts, which were concealed within the Golden Tower. None but those who attain the Dao and achieve perfection may come to know them fully.\n\nIn former times, the Primordial Heavenly King, upon the Golden Lattice and Jade Terrace, bestowed the talismanic sounds and formulae, permitting their transmission to those of the Dao. It was foretold that in the span of one kalpa, a distant age would produce a sage of lofty virtue, one of the White Emperor’s Western Numinous essence, who would seek these texts.\n\nNow that you have inquired, the sign is already clear. I shall not conceal them but shall expound and proclaim them. You should treasure and record them, taking care not to disseminate them lightly. Should one obtain them, the immortal Dao is thereby attained.\n\nHerein, I have transcribed them into a single scroll. First, the true talismans are drawn, and their sounds are explained. There are nineteen talismans of the Great Simplicity and Yang Generation, their script sealed and secret. Within the great and lesser kalpas, their destined time of emergence may yet be awaited.\n\nNow, I transmit to you the true talismans as revealed in the *Numinous Treasure*, with their sounds explained as follows. The talismans within this scroll are all inscribed in vermilion.\"\n\n---\n\n**First: Explanation of the Sounds of the Ten True Scripts of the Five Directions**\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"The Nine Qi of Azure Heaven illuminate the true Dao. Gather the qi—treasured by all perfected beings.\"*\n*(Seventeen characters.)*\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"Sun and moon are fixed; mountains and rivers unfold. The great celebration of the Three Heavens—all perfected ones wander in joy.\"*\n*(Sixteen characters.)*\n\n**Right: Sounds of the two talismans of the East.**\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"The Primordial August Thearch opens heaven and earth.\"*\n*(Eight characters.)*\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"The Jade Tone exhales qi; the Three Simplicities follow the law. Preserve life, fix immortality—sealed by the Jade Calendar.\"*\n*(Sixteen characters.)*\n\n**Right: Sounds of the two talismans of the South.**\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"Gather and command all immortals; restrain and summon the sources of rivers.\"*\n*(Eight characters.)*\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"Summon heaven and earth; the Nine Origins are judged. United with the Kingly Qi, the August Thearch gazes from afar.\"*\n*(Yellow Emperor. Eighteen characters.)*\n\n**Right: Sounds of the two talismans of the Center.**\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"Practice perfection, gather qi, rectify the myriad spirits.\"*\n*(Seven characters.)*\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"Urge the Five Elders’ chariot; gaze west to the Nine Capitals. In kalpas beyond count, they assemble—brightly fixing the Nine Rivers.\"*\n*(Luo Heaven. Eighteen characters.)*\n\n**Right: Sounds of the two talismans of the West.**\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"The Mysterious Loftiness of Jade Clarity summons and commands the Northern Feng.\"*\n*(Eight characters.)*\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"The Northern Dipper fixes the assembly; the nine cycles scatter like radiance. The Eight Poles shine like stone; the Mysterious Essence flourishes.\"*\n*(Fourteen characters.)*\n\n**Right: Sounds of the two talismans of the North.**\n\n**Second: Sounds of the Two Talismans on the Upper and Lower Divination Boards**\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"Heavenly Numinous Marshal, the Great One ascends to heaven; on earth, it opens the Gate of Life. The Mandate of Heaven commands awe; the Lord of Corpses, the Star King, the Mandate of Earth issues forth. The Moon measures heaven and earth.\"*\n*(Twenty-eight characters.)*\n\n**Right: Sound of the upper talisman on the divination board.**\n\n**Middle board, alternate text**\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"Wisdom flourishes, slashing open the mountain courtyard of humanity.\"*\n*(Seven characters.)*\n\n**Third: Sounds of the Five Talismans in the Crimson Staff**\n\n**Right: Sounds of the five talismans in the crimson staff.**\n*(The Life Talisman follows the directional script.)*\n\n**Fourth: Sounds of the Three Divisions’ Twenty-Four Life Talismans**\n\n**Upper Division: Sounds of the eight talismans.**\n*(Each four characters form one verse, totaling thirty-two sounds.)*\n\n**Right: Sounds of the eight talismans of the Middle Division.**\n*(Each four characters form one verse, totaling thirty-two sounds.)*\n\n**Right: Sounds of the eight talismans of the Lower Division.**\n*(Each four characters form one verse, totaling thirty-two sounds.)*\n\n**Fifth: Sounds of the Eight Radiant Registers’ Talismans of the Five Directions’ Demon Kings’ Names and Taboos**\n\n**Right: Sounds of the Eight Radiant Registers’ talismans of the Five Directions’ Demon Kings’ names and taboos.**\n*(The script is uniform; the incantations consist of two verses.)*\n\n**Sixth: Sounds of the Three Divisions’ Eight Radiant Three Chapters of Jade Text Talismans**\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"The heavens above are void and nonexistent; the Mysterious Cavern’s nine and five, the Supreme’s E-Pang, governs the numinous and awesome portal. The Jade Balance gathers qi; the brain’s blossom gazes into the Mysterious. It commands the Upper Division, communicating with spirits and reaching antiquity.\"*\n*(Thirty-two characters, written in blue-green ink.)*\n\n**Sound says:**\n*\"Vermilion Clarity opens the true; the Three Heavens’ qi harmonizes.

The great scriptures of the hidden treasuries remain undisclosed in their full manifestation. The essential decisions of the Lingbao One Vehicle’s talisman-diagrams have yet to be fully revealed to the world. In this latter age, those who rely on and receive them grow ever fewer, while errors and omissions multiply. The texts and meanings are rife with discrepancies, deviating from the ancient forms. With few enlightened masters, there is no means to seek or obtain them.\n\nSurveying the scriptures and diagrams revered by fellow practitioners, errors and distortions abound. Though some have concentrated their true essence and steadfastly preserved them, the texts remain largely spurious. The vulgar and competitive crowd, recklessly grasping at scriptures and methods, all claim that by forming covenants with the Five Thearchs and binding themselves to the Dao’s Primordial Beginning, wielding numinous talismans and wearing the insignia of immortal offices, they may rely on their lofty positions to ascend as immortals. Some conceal their forms in secluded peaks, ingesting arts for years on end, their aspirations aligned with herding sheep, their grasp reaching the source of the Dao.\n\nYet I observe that among fellow practitioners in the world, many bury themselves in remote regions. Advancing, they find no enlightened masters to emulate; retreating, they lack the teachings of the Three Perfected of the Ge lineage. Presumptuously claiming transcendence, they in truth remain mired in emptiness. Upon earnestly examining the principles, it is not that transformation is inherently difficult—rather, it is due to the shallow knowledge of masters and companions, the incomplete transmission of the heritage. Desiring to fathom the luminous mechanism, they are hindered by vast distances and obstacles. Hoping to cross the vast waves, they lack the boat and oars. Their lives pass in sorrow, the path of seeking severed, their years spent in vain, with no awakening or realization.\n\nI, in my humble and lowly state, have fortunately encountered this era. Formerly, I was molded by my teacher’s Perfected guidance, gradually undergoing transformation. Unworthily, I have been extended and supported for over seventy years, yet I have not been able to refine the returning elixir or sustain myself through ingestion and control. Gazing upward at the supreme texts, I have truly forgotten the frost and summer. Studying and perusing the secret records, I have roughly sought to encompass them, yet what I have pursued remains unseen, and I have gathered but a handful.\n\nOn the eighth day of the third month in the *gengwu* year, at the lecture seat, I commanded my disciple Wang Yanzhen to open the treasure terrace of my late teacher. Suddenly, from within a brocade-woven bundle, this single scroll was discovered. The assembled disciples gazed in astonishment, their joy and felicity profound. From birth to maturity, they had never heard of or witnessed its transmission.\n\nThereupon, I offered three taels of gold into the limpid depths of the abyss, reverently receiving the instruction of the Mysterious Master and accepting this text. By the *bingzi* year, seven years had passed, and I transmitted this text to fifty-eight disciples.\n\nThe Dao is magnified through people; the supreme transformation should be equitably shared. Now, I dispatch my disciple Wang Yanzhen to proclaim what has not yet been heard. If you have not yet formed an altar covenant, you may receive the decision at the altar. If you have already received the covenant, you may transcribe this scroll onto plain silk, purifying yourself for seven days—or five days or three days—then reverently open and commence the fast.\n\nIf transmitting to a new covenant, cease at the former pledge. Receiving this scroll alone may be done with one-third of the original pledge. The Heavenly Perfected treasure their worth; they cannot be summoned in vain. People possess inherent conduct; affairs arise from the heart’s resolve. Do not coerce or entice others to comply with their wishes.\n\nGuard this well; keep it secret.\n\n**The Supreme Method of the Golden Mother of Shangqing for Seeking Immortality concludes.**",

The great scriptures of the hidden treasuries remain undisclosed in their full manifestation. The essential decisions of the Lingbao One Vehicle’s talisman-diagrams have yet to be fully revealed to the world. In this latter age, those who rely on and receive them grow ever fewer, while errors and omissions multiply. The texts and meanings are rife with discrepancies, deviating from the ancient forms. With few enlightened masters, there is no means to seek or obtain them.\n\nSurveying the scriptures and diagrams revered by fellow practitioners, errors and distortions abound. Though some have concentrated their true essence and steadfastly preserved them, the texts remain largely spurious. The vulgar and competitive crowd, recklessly grasping at scriptures and methods, all claim that by forming covenants with the Five Thearchs and binding themselves to the Dao’s Primordial Beginning, wielding numinous talismans and wearing the insignia of immortal offices, they may rely on their lofty positions to ascend as immortals. Some conceal their forms in secluded peaks, ingesting arts for years on end, their aspirations aligned with herding sheep, their grasp reaching the source of the Dao.\n\nYet I observe that among fellow practitioners in the world, many bury themselves in remote regions. Advancing, they find no enlightened masters to emulate; retreating, they lack the teachings of the Three Perfected of the Ge lineage. Presumptuously claiming transcendence, they in truth remain mired in emptiness. Upon earnestly examining the principles, it is not that transformation is inherently difficult—rather, it is due to the shallow knowledge of masters and companions, the incomplete transmission of the heritage. Desiring to fathom the luminous mechanism, they are hindered by vast distances and obstacles. Hoping to cross the vast waves, they lack the boat and oars. Their lives pass in sorrow, the path of seeking severed, their years spent in vain, with no awakening or realization.\n\nI, in my humble and lowly state, have fortunately encountered this era. Formerly, I was molded by my teacher’s Perfected guidance, gradually undergoing transformation. Unworthily, I have been extended and supported for over seventy years, yet I have not been able to refine the returning elixir or sustain myself through ingestion and control. Gazing upward at the supreme texts, I have truly forgotten the frost and summer. Studying and perusing the secret records, I have roughly sought to encompass them, yet what I have pursued remains unseen, and I have gathered but a handful.\n\nOn the eighth day of the third month in the *gengwu* year, at the lecture seat, I commanded my disciple Wang Yanzhen to open the treasure terrace of my late teacher. Suddenly, from within a brocade-woven bundle, this single scroll was discovered. The assembled disciples gazed in astonishment, their joy and felicity profound. From birth to maturity, they had never heard of or witnessed its transmission.\n\nThereupon, I offered three taels of gold into the limpid depths of the abyss, reverently receiving the instruction of the Mysterious Master and accepting this text. By the *bingzi* year, seven years had passed, and I transmitted this text to fifty-eight disciples.\n\nThe Dao is magnified through people; the supreme transformation should be equitably shared. Now, I dispatch my disciple Wang Yanzhen to proclaim what has not yet been heard. If you have not yet formed an altar covenant, you may receive the decision at the altar. If you have already received the covenant, you may transcribe this scroll onto plain silk, purifying yourself for seven days—or five days or three days—then reverently open and commence the fast.\n\nIf transmitting to a new covenant, cease at the former pledge. Receiving this scroll alone may be done with one-third of the original pledge. The Heavenly Perfected treasure their worth; they cannot be summoned in vain. People possess inherent conduct; affairs arise from the heart’s resolve. Do not coerce or entice others to comply with their wishes.\n\nGuard this well; keep it secret.\n\n**The Supreme Method of the Golden Mother of Shangqing for Seeking Immortality concludes.**",
