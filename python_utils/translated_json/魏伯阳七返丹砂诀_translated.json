This is the very text in question. It likely emerged in the late Northern and Southern Dynasties (Nanbei Chao) or early Sui-Tang period.\n\nThe *Tang Dynasty Treatise on the Seven Transformations of Soul Cinnabar (Qishuan Lingsha Lun)* by Chen Shaowei shares much the same content as this work. One volume.\n\nSource of the Base Text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era), in the *Dongshen* (Cavernly Divine) section under *Zhongjie* (Miscellaneous Arts).\n\n---\n\n**Wei Boyang’s Seven Transformations of Cinnabar Elixir**\n*Commentary by the Yellow Boy*\n\nThe Dao/Way was born from the Heavenly Maiden,\nThe Heavenly Maiden—mercury—dwells in the Great Yin, hence called *Xuan* (Heavenly) Maiden.\nThe Earth produced the Yellow Male,\nThe Yellow Male—sulfur—is the essence of the Great Yang, hence called *Huang* (Yellow) Male.\nBoth inherit the nature of the Supreme Harmony,\nAnd respond to the subtle, numinous *qi*.\nThis means both substances draw upon the pure, harmonious, and subtle *qi*.\nThe Yang defends the Yin, borrowing its position to reside.\nMercury, born from cinnabar, transforms into liquid mercury, residing in the Yin—this is borrowing its position.\nThe Yin returns to the Yang, restoring its original nature.\nRefining mercury back into cinnabar—restoring its original nature.\n\nZhang and Weifei’s celestial exchange—this is the first transformation.\nZhang—southern constellation—Weifei—northern constellation.\nCinnabar transforms into mercury, mercury returns to cinnabar,\nShifting between south and north, altering its form—this is the first transformation.\n\nLife-giving through seven returns, divine and boundless transformations.\nThrough seven cycles of refinement, it becomes divine and transformative.\nThe Great Yang’s white mercury inherently contains the red water.\nMercury originates from within cinnabar—hence, it contains the red water.\nThe mercury returns to its cinnabar essence—this is the union of exchange.\nMercury is the essence and fluid of cinnabar,\nIts back-and-forth transformation is the union of forming elixir and returning to source.\n\nThe Primordial *qi* is vague and indistinct,\nTransforming and taking form.\nThe pure *Yuanqi* (Primordial *qi*) and *Taiyi* (Supreme Unity) are vague and indistinct, without form,\nYet within, the numinous essence coalesces,\nAnd generates the form of cinnabar and mercury.\n\nOnce the form is manifest,\nIt transforms into Yin essence.\nFrom the void, it generates cinnabar and mercury,\nCinnabar resides in the Yang,\nAnd then transforms into Yin—becoming liquid mercury.\n\nSouls and spirits disperse,\nYet return and bind to one another.\nThe Yin and Yang disperse,\nYet return and bind—this is the symbol of boundless transformation.\nHaving established the forms of Yin and Yang,\nIt ascends and returns to the Upper Palace.\nThe Upper Palace is the southern realm;\nHaving established the forms of Yin and Yang,\nIt ascends, transforms, and returns to its southern source palace.\nOnce the Primordial *qi* is void and indistinct,\nIt governs all things.\nCinnabar and mercury are the Primordial *qi*,\nVoid yet generating transformation,\nUntil they become liquid mercury.\nNow, no longer confused,\nThey return to their source palace—\nThis is the Dao/Way’s origin,\nAnd its governance over all transformations.\n\nMoreover, when the two natures harmonize,\nThey become husband and wife,\nSon and mother,\nLord and subject.\nThe two natures harmonized cannot be counted—\nEach is singular, yet boundless.\nNow, having obtained the talisman and control,\nYou command them as water extinguishes fire—\nTheir form naturally returns,\nAnd they descend to the Earthly realm.\n\n---\n\n**Ten Verses**\n\nThe crucible is round and firm, the porcelain vessel fully luminous.\nA single crucible, with a lid—\nA harmonious, static, and firm vessel.\nThe top and bottom correspond, interlocking like teeth.\nThe top and bottom align,\nHidden yet perfectly matched.\n\nThe third part of the whole—\nThis is the constant of Heaven and Earth.\nDivide the elixir ingredients into thirds—\nConforming to Heaven and Earth’s natural measure.\n\nAn inch in diameter, broad or narrow,\nHolds a little over one *sheng*.\nThe vessel can contain one and a half *sheng*—\nThis is twenty-four *liang* of medicine.\n\nNot confined to high hills or low valleys,\nNor limited to *yuanyang*’s domain.\nDo not discard the Pure Primordial—\nThe outer clay is urgent.\n\nThe outer clay’s earth,\nUnbound by height or depth,\nMust be of pure soil.\n\nUse vine tendrils to stir and blend,\nEnsuring thorough integration.\nWith vine paper as the sinew,\nEnsure their fusion.\n\nSeal it twice,\nEach time exhausting internal moisture.\nApply clay to the crucible twice,\nEach time waiting until dry.\n\nMeasure the *zhu* and *liang* precisely,\nAs melting and refining harmonize.\nDetermine the weight,\nThen cast into fire—\nIn an instant, they naturally blend.\n\nNow purple, now yellow,\nSometimes white, sometimes black.\nIn the melting process,\nColors shift unpredictably.\n\nStirring the chaos,\nUnchanging in south or north.\nAt the critical moment,\nThe two substances merge—\nIndivisible, never to part.\n\nHeaven and Earth’s natural transformations\nAre the sages’ guiding principle.\nThey follow the subtleties of the Great Void,\nCreating movement as law.\n\nFire is the sole foundation,\nOyster shell powder must be moist.\nEstablish the method—\nOnly fire makes it excellent,\nOyster shell powder’s luster is its marvel.\n\nBut let it be firm and dense,\nNo need for five-to-two ratios.\nAncients used seven flavors and six-to-one clay—\nThis method discards the old ways.\n\nWhen the moment arrives, seal it,\nThen draw in the *qi*.\nClose it tightly,\nNext, draw in the internal *qi* completely,\nThen seal it.\n\nThe sages’ transmitted method\nLies in the ebb and flow of intent.\nThough past masters grasped the method,\nAt the moment of practice,\nThey observed the transformations,\nJudging carefully by intent.\n\nFirst, establish the city walls,\nThen complete the martial array.\nPerform the Five Phases’ gentle fire first,\nTo set the *qi*’s boundaries.\nThen apply the Six Times’ fierce fire,\nTo perfect its essence.\n\nRadiance ascends and descends,\nAwe-inspiring with patterns.\nAs the form dissolves,\nThe spirit essence transforms.\nPressured by gentle fire,\nThe upper and lower shift—\nMelting and refining,\nBecoming sacred sand.\n\nThe enlightened find it easy,\nThe confused struggle.\nError lies in extraction or addition,\nSuccess in receiving *qi*.\nA difference of a single *zhu*,\nForever separates one from the Dao.\n\nThose who extract mercury or add sulfur\nAre mistaken.\nAll are lost to the Way,\nFalling into delusion,\nUnaware of *qi*’s true source.\n\nThe art of immortality\nIs not mere technique—it must be kept secret.\nI transmit to the Celestial Master,\nCarved on the *Kongtong* stone record.\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nScholars by the thousands\nFail to grasp its essence,\nExhausting their fortunes in pursuit.\n\nTo know its core,\nOne must master the Three Flowers.\nThe Three Flowers—fire.\nIts essence lies in timing and intent.\nWithout this key,\nAll effort is in vain.\n\nChaos returns to obscurity,\nDispersing like scattered clouds.\nThen it reverses—\nChaos returns to obscurity,\nSuddenly like clouds dispersing,\nForming elixir clouds.\n\nTo achieve spiritual penetration,\nSeven transformations are supreme.\nTo reverse and attain eternal life,\nSeven cycles must forge the elixir sand—\nThis is the ancient gods’ safeguard.\n\nIts hue surpasses cinnabar’s glow,\nIts radiance rivals the sun’s.\nAncient sages’ secret transmission,\nThe essence of immortality.\n\nThe medicine, once formed,\nSubmerge in cold springs seven days,\nDriving away the sun’s heat.\nThen steam it three days,\nWarding off yin toxicity,\nOnly then fit for consumption.\n\nGrind it finely—\nThis is the standard method.\nPill it like mung beans,\nNot too large.\nGrind it meticulously,\nPill it like peas,\nNot too coarse.\n\nTake three grains each dawn,\nBeginning on *jiazi* day.\nOn this medicine’s first day,\nAt dawn, face south,\nSit still and composed,\nWith wine, swallow three grains.\nVisualize the medicine as crimson clouds\nDescending from heaven into the five *zang*,\nThe clouds dispersing through the four limbs.\nHold your breath for thirty-six breaths,\nTap your teeth thirty-six times.\nAt the moment of transformation,\nThe medicine enters the limbs—\nEars and eyes sharpen,\nThis is its effect.\n\nAfter a thousand days,\nSpiritual penetration is complete.\nFollowing the method faithfully,\nEach day’s dose fulfilled,\nYour vision knows no night or day,\nGhosts cannot hide their forms,\nYou recite ten thousand words daily.\nYour complexion red and white,\nLike a child’s.\n\nYour spirit calms, your breath steadies.\nA thousand autumns—no death.\n\nWhen the spirit is calmed and the mind composed,\nEntering the Nine Chambers,\nEternal life is attained—\nThe Dao is complete.\n\nThus concludes the *Wei Boyang’s* Seven Refining Secrets of *dansha*.",
