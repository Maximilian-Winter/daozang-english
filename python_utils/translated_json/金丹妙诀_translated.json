  "full_translation": "**\"The Alchemical Secret of *Jindan*: *Shoushi Fan ting* (Gathering Vision, Returning Hearing)**\n\nThe Master of Ji Yang said:\n\n*\"Shoushi* means drawing the eye’s light inward from the external world into the *Xuan Guan* (Mysterious Pass), where it settles and stills, transforming into sweet dew. Swallow it down into the *Dantian* (Elixir Field), then guide it with intent into the *Qi Xue* (Qi Cavity). When the eye’s light gazes downward upon the *Qi Xue*, the spirit manifests in stillness—this is the *Kuanzi* (Self-Sovereign) Bodhisattva.\n\nWhat is called *returning observation* is the inward contemplation of the ever-still true heart, the dual cultivation of essence and spirit to escape the wheel of suffering.\n\nThe scripture says: *'First, master the two eyes.'* The eyes are the repository of the spirit; one must observe inwardly, never gaze outward. I say: Do not observe near, do not observe far—constantly observe the void of non-doing, this aperture being the *Xuan Guan* (Mysterious Aperture).\n\nThe Dao Ancestor taught: *'Observe with constant desire to perceive its aperture; observe without desire to grasp its mystery.'* The mystery is the marvel within the aperture—when one perceives the aperture’s marvel, it is called *defining insight*.\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor obtained the *Cai Feng Book*, which stated:\n*'If swallowing does not cease, the body grows heavy;\nIf thought does not cease, the spirit grows clouded;\nIf sounds and colors do not cease, the heart grows restless.\nA restless heart dulls the spirit;\nA dulled spirit fails to attain the Dao.'*\nIts essence lies not in gazing at stars or bowing to constellations, nor in exhausting the body—\nbut in the stillness of the mind’s inch, free from all striving.\nThus, the Dao of immortality is attained.\n\nIt is said: *For every measure of emptiness in the heart, a measure of true nature is revealed; for every ten measures of emptiness, ten measures of true nature appear.* When this clarity suddenly penetrates, it is called *enlightening the heart and seeing true nature.*\n\nTherefore, when the original spirit strays outward, swiftly return the light, drawing it back into the *Qiangzi* (Vital Chamber). Even a moment’s practice brings natural stillness to body and mind, dispersing all malevolent influences—then the radiant sun shines clear.\n\nWhen thought arises, the spirit departs; when thought ceases, the spirit returns.\nThus, the Zen school values *stillness of thought*, the Confucian school values *self-mastery*, and the Daoist path values *self-refinement*.\n\n*Fanti* (Returning Hearing) refers to returning to the marvel of the *Dantian*.\nIf one’s ears unconsciously follow sounds, swiftly gather the resonance, drawing it back into the *Qi Xue*, returning to the marvel of the *Dantian*.\nNaturally, the Zen mechanism falls silent, and profound stillness prevails.\nWith time and practice, it becomes immovably serene, effortlessly harmonized and great.\n\nThus it is said:\n*'Though the eyes see colors, I return the light and do not receive them within;\nThough the ears hear sounds, I return the resonance and do not take them in;\nThough the spirit responds to things, I remain still and do not let thoughts arise;\nWhen the original yang stirs and perceives things, I awaken inwardly and do not stray—\nSwiftly refine with wind and fire.'*\n\nIn moments of no-thought, when the *jing* (essence) leaks—whether through seminal emission, the male’s *waiguan* (external gate) rising, or the female’s monthly flow—this is the *Guanyuan* (Pass Gate) stirring, called *living in time*.\nSeeing this without falling into delusion, one steadies the will and *qi*, gathering the subtle original spirit into the moving *qi*.\nMindful at every breath, returning to the root without pause, like silk threads unbroken.\nWhen essence and blood transform into *qi*, guide this *qi* back into the *Qi Xue*, sealing the heart.\nPurge the turbid *qi* from the *Yongquan* (Gushing Spring), then guard the original spirit at the *Qi Xue*, gently inhaling and exhaling—\nthe *qi* will naturally spiral upward, passing the Three Passes, ascending to the *Nihuan* (Eye Cavity), entering the *Xuanqiao* (Mysterious Bridge).\nWith *Xuanqiao* breathing, the *Dharma Wheel* turns.\nStillness and clarity transform into sweet dew, descending into the *Dantian Qi Xue*, returning to the root and reclaiming life.\nEven a moment’s practice blends spirit and *qi* unconsciously—\nbody and spirit both refined, mind and body joyful.\nThis is the wondrous method of cultivating immortality.\n\nThe human spirit resides in the heart; the heart’s mechanism is in the eyes.\nIf the eyes gaze ten *li* away, the heart-spirit follows ten *li* distant.\nWhen the eyes do not stray far, returning inward, the heart-spirit follows within.\nNot only is it within—it is also still.\nWhen the heart is greatly still, the kidney waters rise to the *Nihuan*, and the heart fire descends to the *Dantian*.\nDrinking the sweet essence, the whole body feels joy.\nThus it is said:\n*'At every moment, returning the light and inward reflection is easy to learn;\nA heart without delusion is the Dao itself.'*\n\nIn ancient times, the Yellow Emperor obtained the *Shenzhi Diagram* and sought instruction from the *Taiyi Huangren* (Great Unity Sovereign).\nHe said: *'This is the Dao of the Three-One.'*\nIf one constantly guards the Three-One, true immortality is achieved.\nWhat are the Three?\n*Jing* (essence), *qi* (vital breath), *shen* (spirit).\n\nBefore Heaven, they were one; after Heaven, they became three.\nThe eyes do not gaze but gather the spirit;\nthe ears do not listen but preserve the essence;\nthe mouth does not speak but nurtures the *qi*.\nWhen the three apertures—eyes, ears, mouth—are tightly sealed,\nthe methods of *preserving essence, nourishing qi, and storing spirit* are attained.\n\nIt is said: *'The outer Three Treasures do not leak; the inner Three Treasures do not dissipate.'*\nRefining the three to return to one is called *Three Flowers Converging at the Crown*.\nThe Crown refers to the *Xuan Guan* aperture—\nthe root of Heaven and Earth, the source of the Three Realms,\nthe *Dharma Storehouse Eye*, the *Total-Holding Gate*,\nthe ladder to Heaven, the path to the Southern Pole,\ncalled the *Mysterious Female*, the *Wuji* (Five-Six),\nthe *Knife and Chisel*, the *True One*—\nnone other than the convergence of metal and wood,\nthe meeting place of the infant and the maiden.\n\nThe scripture says: *'Only the pure and singular, steadfastly holding the center.'*\n\nThe Sage Confucius said: *'My Dao is one, threading through all things.'*\n\n「’ *\"Damo said: 'Once attained, all matters are complete.'*\nAh! Though names and forms vary greatly,\nthey all point to the singular *Xuan Guan* aperture!\n\nThe ancient sages declared:\n*'This aperture is no ordinary orifice—\nHeaven and Earth coalesce therein.\nCalled the *Shen Qi* Hole,\nwithin it lies the *Kan Li* Essence.*\n\nTo grasp this aperture,\none must not rely on mere cleverness—\nonly the true teacher knows its way.\n\nThus it is said:\n*'Though your wisdom surpasses Yan Min’s,\nwithout the true teacher’s guidance, no amount of guessing will suffice.\nFor without the *Golden Elixir*’s oral formula,\nwhere would you anchor the sacred embryo?’*\n\nIf a person attains this aperture,\never keep the ears, eyes, and mouth\ndrawn inward—this is *Three Flowers Converging at the Crown*.\n\nThen, refine the breath softly and continuously,\nthis is called *Four Phases Returning to Wuji* (Five-Six).\n*Wu* (Steward) soil resides in the *Dantian*,\n*Ji* (Earth) soil is entrusted to the *Xuan Guan*.\nTo master *Ji*,\nnaturally restore *Wu*—\nthat is, to condense the spirit into the *Dantian*,\nwhile the true *qi* returns to the *Xuan Guan*.\nThis is what is meant by *Taking Kan to Fill Li*,\nthis is it. ’\n**Condense the spirit into the *qi*.**」\n\nThe **Jìyáng Zǐ** said:\n\n*\"The human spirit, by day, scatters and strays without foundation,\nby night, dreams in myriad forms.\nIf one does not condense and return it to stillness,\nhow then can the form and spirit both attain perfection?\n\nThe method lies in the instant return of light to its source,\ncondensing the original spirit back into the *Zǔqiào* (Ancestral Aperture) and *Xuán Guān* (Mysterious Pass).\nHold it in stillness and refine it into *Gānlù* (Sweet Dew) to swallow inward,\nthen send it downward to the *Qíxué* (Qi Cavern) at the *Qìlún* (Navel Wheel).\nThis cavern lies just before the navel, slightly behind it,\nwhere a void circle exists—this is called the *Tàijí* (Great Polarity).\nHere, the vital essence that sustains life is knotted and formed.\nMy mind rests here, and I observe within.\nI then gather all the spirit previously condensed\nand return it fully to this cavern,\nlike a cat seizing a mouse or a dragon nurturing a pearl.\nThe true *qi* naturally flows inward,\ngenerating warmth and the rise of *Yáng* (Yang).\n\nSince the moment we severed the umbilical cord,\nthe true *qi* within this cavern cannot communicate with the *Xuán Guān*.\nWithout the union of water and fire,\nthe *Rèn Dū* (Conception and Governing Vessels) are blocked—\nthis is the seed of death.\nBut once the formula is obtained,\ncondense the spirit and focus on the *Xuán Guān*,\nholding still for long durations.\nThen, the breath of life,\nfrom the *Gānlù*, penetrates deeply into the *Qi Cavern*,\nwith every breath returning to the root,\nsoft and continuous as if preserved.\nAt times of stillness,\nthe original *qi* of the cavern ascends backward to the *Xuán Guān*,\nrefines into *Gānlù*, and descends again into the cavern—\nparent and child reunite, like a broken mirror restored.\nOne ascent, one descent—water and fire now harmonized.\nGradually, it condenses and solidifies,\nstrengthening the foundation of the elixir.\n\nThe *Guīzhǐ* (Jade Instructions) says:\n*'Nurture the original source,\nprotect the vital essence.'*\n\nThe **Yùchán Zǔshī** (Jade Hare Patriarch) says:\n*'Once you grasp the master’s oral formula,\nsimply condense the spirit into the *Qi Cavern*.'*\n\nThe **Xìnglín Shī** (Apricot Grove Master) says:\n*'All things have death,\nyet the original spirit dies and is reborn.\nBy entering the spirit into the *Qi Cavern*,\nthe elixir’s Dao naturally manifests.'*\n\n**Refine the breath softly and continuously:**\nThe **Jìyáng Zǐ** says:\nAs previously written, the spirit condensed and the *qi* gathered,\nthe vital root now full, the elixir’s foundation firm.\nYet without refining the true breath,\nthere is fear that the fire will grow cold and the elixir slow,\nand the sacred medicine will not sprout.\n\nThe method of refining the breath is hard to speak of,\nbut when one attains the great equilibrium of stillness,\nthe true breath is naturally refined.\nThe ancient immortals said:\n*'Refining the breath must refine the true breath,\ncultivating the spirit must cultivate the non-spirit spirit.*\nThis true breath and that non-spirit spirit—\nthese two are the true *Lónghǔ* (Dragon and Tiger),\ntrue *Yīnyáng* (Yin and Yang),\ntrue *Shuǐhuǒ* (Water and Fire),\ntrue *Fūfù* (Husband and Wife),\ntrue *Tāixī* (Parental and Child Essences),\ntrue *Xuán Pìn* (Mysterious Female),\ntrue *Tǔoqiào* (Diaphragmatic Key).\n\nAh!\nWith the *Xuán Pìn*’s inhalation and exhalation,\nand the *Tǔoqiào*’s closing and opening,\nthey come and go in mutual exchange.\nThe natural fire’s potency—\nwhy should it rely on chaotic actions through mouth and nose?\n\nYet there are methods that combine both.\nThus, the ancient sages said:\n*'Refine the breath by following the breath,\nknow the mind without using the mind.\nStable and unmoving, it produces true gold in an instant.'*\n\nWonderful!\nGold indeed!\"\n\n「\"The *Biánmián* (Continuous Refinement) practice is to maintain uninterrupted awareness of the true breath at every moment throughout the twelve times [of the day].\n\n\"The true breath of humanity is like the sun and moon of heaven. Heaven’s sun and moon revolve without ceasing, day and night, coming and going endlessly; the true breath of humanity rises behind and descends before—how could it ever stop? And yet, how could it ever be interrupted? One must guide it from the *Xuán Guān* (Mysterious Pass) above to the *Qì Xué* (Qi Cavern) below, stabilize the *Qì Xué*, and let each breath return to its root, continuous and unbroken. Through repeated cultivation and refinement, it naturally ascends and descends without pause.\n\n*Zhōnglí Zǔ* said: *\"If one can attend to each breath in turn,\nthe mortal form will be transformed—pure and flowing like jade essence.\"*\n\nBut if one practices for a time and then rests,\nor practices for a day and then rests a day,\nhow could this ever be the Dao of *Jīndān* (Alchemical Elixir)?\n\n*Confucius* said: *\"The Dao is something one cannot for a moment depart from.\"*\nIs this not worth pondering?\n\n**The Unity of Heart and Breath** — *Jìyáng Zǐ* said:\n*\"The heart is not a clump of flesh or the daily mind,\nbut the original nature, the true *Rú* (Thusness) of the heavenly heart.\nThe Confucianists say: 'When human desires are purified away,\nthe *Tīanlǐ* (Heavenly Principle) flows freely.'\nThis is how one can perceive the heavenly heart.\nThe *Journey to the West* is entirely due to *Wùkōng* (Awakened to Emptiness).\nWùkōng’s original nature perceives *Rú* (Thusness),\nthus it is called 'seeing the *Rúlái* (Thusness-Comer).'\nIt departs and arrives according to principle.\nTo empty the mundane heart is to see the heavenly heart.\nTo see the heavenly heart is to see the Thusness-Comer.\nTo see the Thusness-Comer, one must grasp the moment.\"\n\n*Shào Fūzǐ* said:\n*\"When the moon reaches the heavenly heart,\nand the wind stirs the surface of the waters—*\nthat is the time.\nThe *Heart Sutra* states:\n*'At this moment, it is the time of the heavenly heart,\nthe time of *Yángqì* (Yang Qi) arising,\nthe time of the *Yīyuán* (One Source) beginning anew.\nWhen the time arrives, the spirit knows—\nthe heavenly heart is present,\nand the Thusness-Comer is seen.\nThe *Dāntián* (Elixir Field) grows warm and hot,\nand all things meet with spring.\nWonderful!\nWonderful!\"*\n\n\"Now, the **breath** spoken of is not the gross breath taken through the mouth and nose, but the **true breath** within the **Qi Cavern**.\n\nTo perceive this breath, one must eliminate stray thoughts, attain utmost emptiness, and steadfastly guard stillness. When the mind is empty, the nature reveals itself, and the mouth and nose cease their breath. Yet the mundane breath halts while the true breath moves. In a state of **dim, boundless obscurity**, the **Qi Cavern** manifests a single aperture—**mysterious and indistinct**, called the **Aperture within the Aperture**, which is exactly the moment when, as mentioned earlier, the spirit knows.\n\nHumans attain this utmost stillness during the night, when sleep is just awakened, and the mind is at its purest quiet. The **Elixir** is born, and the spirit knows. Those who do not recognize it pass it by in plain sight. One must concentrate the spirit into the **Qi Cavern**, returning each breath to its root. Whether forgotten or remembered, **fervently boil and refine** with utmost intensity. **Refine essence into qi**, and reverse it, returning it to the **Qi Cavern**. When the **Yang Qi** grows warm and hot, let it circulate and govern the **Lesser Heaven**—\n\nThe mind and breath are interdependent; the spirit’s illumination must never be separated, for separation leads to **dryness and imbalance**.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*'When the spirit moves, the qi moves;\nwhen the spirit dwells, the qi dwells.'*\nInterdependent and inseparable, one must remain sincere and resolute. **Harvest and refine**, inhaling and exhaling. In **dynamic stillness**, advance and retreat as needed—**harmonizing and tranquil**, the **Great Stillness** manifests boundless natural wonders.\n\nFrom the **Golden Elixir’s** beginning to its end, it must never stray from this method to succeed. Truly vast!\n\nThis is the profound essence of **heart-breath harmony**.\n\nNow, in **walking, standing, sitting, or lying**, one must regulate the breath through the mouth and nose. If unregulated, one cannot perceive the **true breath**. The method lies in concentrating the spirit into the **Qi Cavern**, guarding the mind at the **Qi Cavern**, and letting the intention follow the **breath’s ascent and descent**. Inhaling, connect with the **Heavenly Root** at the **Mysterious Pass**; exhaling, connect with the **Earthly Root** at the **Qi Cavern**. This is called **internal communion with true qi**, preserving the breath—**naturally transforming and restoring the childlike countenance**.\n\nAs **Chen Zhichu** said:\n*'A single great path few seek,\nwhere the **Wind Tiger** and **Cloud Dragon** freely roam.\nWhen seated, know the breath’s motion is key—\nthe **True Person’s** breath is deep and profound.'*\n\nThe *Guizhi* states:\n*'Not the **Mysterious Gate’s** subtle teachings,\nbut the high mountain’s flowing waters lack true resonance.\nIf one can trace the path of its coming,\nthe **Red Boy** remains in **primordial chaos** of the heart.'*\nIf asked about the **path of its coming**, it is the single aperture of the **Qi Cavern**. Concentrate and condense it into **Elixir**; transcend the **Mysterious Pass**; **nurture and refine** it with reverence, and ascending through the **Heaven Gate** is achieved.\n\n**Red-Belly Child** said:\n*'Between the **Qi Cavern**—\nancients named it the **Gate of Life** and **Door of Death**,\nalso the **roots of Heaven and Earth**.\nConcentrating the spirit here,\nthe **Primordial Qi** daily grows full,\nthe **Primordial Spirit** daily flourishes.\nWhen the spirit flourishes, the qi flows freely;\nwhen the qi flows freely, the blood harmonizes;\nwhen the blood harmonizes, the bones strengthen;\nwhen the bones strengthen, the marrow fills;\nwhen the marrow fills, the abdomen swells;\nwhen the abdomen swells, the **lower dantian** solidifies—\nthen, walking is light and effortless,\nmovement knows no fatigue,\nthe four limbs are healthy,\nthe complexion glows like peach blossoms,\nand **immortality is not far away.**'*",

      "translated_text": "\"Now, the **breath** spoken of is not the gross breath taken through the mouth and nose, but the **true breath** within the **Qi Cavern**.\n\nTo perceive this breath, one must eliminate stray thoughts, attain utmost emptiness, and steadfastly guard stillness. When the mind is empty, the nature reveals itself, and the mouth and nose cease their breath. Yet the mundane breath halts while the true breath moves. In a state of **dim, boundless obscurity**, the **Qi Cavern** manifests a single aperture—**mysterious and indistinct**, called the **Aperture within the Aperture**, which is exactly the moment when, as mentioned earlier, the spirit knows.\n\nHumans attain this utmost stillness during the night, when sleep is just awakened, and the mind is at its purest quiet. The **Elixir** is born, and the spirit knows. Those who do not recognize it pass it by in plain sight. One must concentrate the spirit into the **Qi Cavern**, returning each breath to its root. Whether forgotten or remembered, **fervently boil and refine** with utmost intensity. **Refine essence into qi**, and reverse it, returning it to the **Qi Cavern**. When the **Yang Qi** grows warm and hot, let it circulate and govern the **Lesser Heaven**—\n\nThe mind and breath are interdependent; the spirit’s illumination must never be separated, for separation leads to **dryness and imbalance**.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*'When the spirit moves, the qi moves;\nwhen the spirit dwells, the qi dwells.'*\nInterdependent and inseparable, one must remain sincere and resolute. **Harvest and refine**, inhaling and exhaling.

Truly vast!\n\nThis is the profound essence of **heart-breath harmony**.\n\nNow, in **walking, standing, sitting, or lying**, one must regulate the breath through the mouth and nose. If unregulated, one cannot perceive the **true breath**. The method lies in concentrating the spirit into the **Qi Cavern**, guarding the mind at the **Qi Cavern**, and letting the intention follow the **breath’s ascent and descent**. Inhaling, connect with the **Heavenly Root** at the **Mysterious Pass**; exhaling, connect with the **Earthly Root** at the **Qi Cavern**. This is called **internal communion with true qi**, preserving the breath—**naturally transforming and restoring the childlike countenance**.\n\nAs **Chen Zhichu** said:\n*'A single great path few seek,\nwhere the **Wind Tiger** and **Cloud Dragon** freely roam.\nWhen seated, know the breath’s motion is key—\nthe **True Person’s** breath is deep and profound.'*\n\nThe *Guizhi* states:\n*'Not the **Mysterious Gate’s** subtle teachings,\nbut the high mountain’s flowing waters lack true resonance.\nIf one can trace the path of its coming,\nthe **Red Boy** remains in **primordial chaos** of the heart.'*\nIf asked about the **path of its coming**, it is the single aperture of the **Qi Cavern**. Concentrate and condense it into **Elixir**; transcend the **Mysterious Pass**; **nurture and refine** it with reverence, and ascending through the **Heaven Gate** is achieved.\n\n**Red-Belly Child** said:\n*'Between the **Qi Cavern**—\nancients named it the **Gate of Life** and **Door of Death**,\nalso the **roots of Heaven and Earth**.\nConcentrating the spirit here,\nthe **Primordial Qi** daily grows full,\nthe **Primordial Spirit** daily flourishes.\nWhen the spirit flourishes, the qi flows freely;\nwhen the qi flows freely, the blood harmonizes;\nwhen the blood harmonizes, the bones strengthen;\nwhen the bones strengthen, the marrow fills;\nwhen the marrow fills, the abdomen swells;\nwhen the abdomen swells, the **lower dantian** solidifies—\nthen, walking is light and effortless,\nmovement knows no fatigue,\nthe four limbs are healthy,\nthe complexion glows like peach blossoms,\nand **immortality is not far away.**'*",
