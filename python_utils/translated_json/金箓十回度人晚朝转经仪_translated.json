Celestial Sovereign of the Boundless Dao/Way** in the Upper Realm,\nThe **Long-Living Great Sage, the Flight-Heaven Deva King of Infinite Salvation**.\n\nSeated upon the **Circular Luo**, His **merits cover all**—\nHis **jewel-like brilliance** lets Him hear the **Golden Mouth’s exposition**,\nHis **lofty cloud-canopy** ever attends the **Jade Capital’s governance**.\n\nWe humbly pray for His **radiant descent** and **command of restorative power**—\nMay **yin-yang, cold-heat** find their balance, **no creature suffer blemish or plague**,\nMay the **sun, moon, and stars** shine in their proper order, **the land abound in auspicious omens**.\n\nWith **manifest decrees** in hand, we now **solemnly proclaim**.\n\n**Proclamation of the Decree**\n*Burning the Offering*\n\n*\"Attending the

of the Boundless Lower Realm, the Most Sacred and Precious Heavenly Venerable**,\nAnd the **Boundless Lower Realm’s Flying Celestial Deity-King, the Eternal Great Sage, the Infinite Liberator of

total—\nAnd **kneels in homage to the Ten Directions** before retiring.\n\nFacing east, with **heartfelt reverence**, I **bow three times**,\nClosing my eyes, I **recite the secret mantra**:\n*\"I, [Name], have reverently recited the **Sutra of the Supreme Origin’s Liberating Sentient Beings in the Highest Grade**—\nTen full circuits now completed.\n\nI beseech the **Celestial Dragon Palanquin**

again, they shall **return as before**.\n\nAfter the Master **concentrates and returns the Officials**,\nHe **knocks the teeth three times**,\nAnd **swallows the saliva three times**.\n\n**Making the Vow**—\nThe **Incense Furnace** is restored as originally.\n\n**Summoning the Celestial Officials**—\nThe **Immortal Sovereigns and Celestial Officials**,\nThe **Golden Boys and Jade Girls**,\nThe **Five Emperors and Five Sacred Mountains’ Immortal Worthies**,\nThe **Three Qi’s Pure Deities**,\nThe **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**,\nThe **Heavenly and Earthly Immortals**,\nThe **Five

**Piercing Clarity**.\n\nI have **reverently received** the **Imperial Edicts**,\nAnd **devoutly observed** the **Golden Talismans and Grand Fast**,\n**Reciting** the *Supreme Scripture of the Dao/Way’s Mystic Treasures, Infinite Degrees of Humanity, and Highest Perfection* **ten times**,\nAnd **hope** for **Divine Inspection and Verification**—\nFortunately, it has been **completed**.\n\nI now **devoutly present** my **sincere vows**,\nAnd **directly proffer** my **thanks**.\n\nI **humbly reflect** that my **physique** is not **immortal**,\nAnd my **corporeal form** is still **impure**.\nTo **declare** the **Cloud-Signs and Talismans**,\nHow could I **grasp** them with my **hands** or **heart**?\nTo **recite** the **Celestial Scriptures**,\nIs merely to **speak** with my **mouth** and **hear** with my **ears**.\n\nMy **meditation** is **confused and erroneous**,\nAnd my **chanting** is **hollow and discordant**.\nI have **not yet attained** the **Mystic Insight of Piercing Clarity**,\nYet I **first invite** the **faults of carelessness and arrogance**.\n\nI **pray** for **Spring’s Nurturing Grace**,\nAnd **beg** for **Oceanic Tolerance**.\nI **knock my teeth three times**,\nAnd **swallow my saliva ten times**—\n**Having recited the Talismanic Sutra to completion**,\nI **humbly await** Your **Merciful Inspection**.\n\nI **vow** that Your **Sacred Heart** be **broad and encompassing**,\nAnd the **Cosmos** **embrace** the **Great Mercy**.\nMay You **not exact** the **punishment of the Axe and Cleaver**,\nAnd **instead bestow** the **blessing of the Silk Canopy**.\n\nThus, the **teachings** shall **radiate** across the **world**,\nAnd the **Dao’s grace** **shine** upon the **land**.\n\nMay the **assemblage of devotees** **sincerely** **deliver** this **vow**.\n\n**Returning to the Altar**,\nI **bow** before the **Curtain** and **take leave of the Master**.\n\nThe **Master** **presents incense** and **performs two prostrations**.\n\nAll the **Celestial Officials**,\nI **once more** **sincerely** **pray** to the **True Lord of the Mystic Treasures’ Highest Dao**,\nThe **True Lords of the Mystic Treasures Scripture**, the **Scripture Master**, the **Master of Degrees**,\nThe **Supreme Lord of the Rectified Dao**,\nThe **Female, Successor, and System Masters**,\nThe **True Lord of the Mystic Treasures’ Grand Supervisor of the Fast**,\nThe **Opener of the Red Diagram** and the **Receptor of the Millet Pearl Transmission**—\nThe **One Lineage of Teachers**.\n\nI **reverently** **behold** Your **Mercy**,\nAnd **humble myself** in **gratitude**.\n\nI **humbly** **acknowledge** that I have **frequently relied** upon Your **teachings**,\nAnd **broadly proclaimed** Your **precious texts**.\nI have **already been enlightened**,\nAnd **fortunate** to **fulfill** the **completion**.\n\nI **reverently approach** Your **steps**,\nAnd **specially express** my **gratitude**.\n\nI have **previously led** the **Celestial Officials**,\nAnd **ascended the altar** to **recite** the *Supreme Scripture of the Dao/Way’s Mystic Treasures, Infinite Degrees of Humanity, and Highest Perfection* **from the Ninth to the Tenth Section**,\nAnd **successfully fulfilled** the **completion**.\n\nI **rely** upon Your **Grace**,\nAnd **achieve** the **good intentions**.\n\nI **directly exhaust** my **humble sincerity**,\nAnd **pay homage** to the **Mystic Hall**.\n\nI **once more reflect** that my **body** has **not yet penetrated** the **True Dao**,\nSo I **cannot fathom** the **Mystic Profoundness**;\nMy **learning** has **not reached** the **Dao**,\nAnd I **am ashamed** not to have **attained** the **Pure Void**.\n\nI **humbly pray** for **Great Compassion’s Grace**,\nAnd **beg** for **Mystic Teachers’ Blessings**.\nMay You **look down** upon the **unworthy disciple**,\nAnd **not condemn** him with **rebuke**.\n\nThus, my **family and nation** may **benefit** from Your **Grace**,\nAnd **both the living and dead** **gain blessings**.\n\nWhen **good deeds are perfected**,\nThe **rankings of merit** shall **take form**.\nI **dare** not **violate** Your **strictures**—\nMy **lowly feelings** are **unutterably** **deep**.\nI **gaze** upon the **Heavenly Steps**,\nAnd **bow** with a **devoted heart**.\n\n**Performing the Fast**—\nThe **Cloud-Carriage**.\n\n**In past observances,**\nI **recited** the *Golden Talisman Sutra* ten times,\n**conducting** the **Evening Scripture Turning** for **deliverance of beings**,\n**following** the **proper ritual etiquette**.",
