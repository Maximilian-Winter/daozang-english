  "full_translation": "**The Profound Principles of the Numinous Treasure’s Mysterious Gate**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Profound Principles of the Numinous Treasure’s Mysterious Gate* (Dongxuan Lingbao Xuemen Dayi). Also known as *The Great Treatise of the Mysterious Gate* (Xuemen Dalun) or *The Great Treatise of the Daoist Gate* (Daomen Dalun). The author is unknown, though it likely emerged between the Sui and Tang dynasties. According to the *Catalogue of Missing Scriptures in the Daoist Canon*, the original text comprised twenty scrolls, of which only one now remains. The base text is derived from the *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Taiping Section. See also *The Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel*, Scroll Six.\n\n---\n\n### **The Profound Principles of the Numinous Treasure’s Mysterious Gate**\n\n#### **Chapter One: The Orthodox Meaning**\nThe Twelve Categories of Scriptures are the wondrous canon that unites the Three Vehicles and encompasses the grand principles of the Seven Divisions. Those who study them attain true knowledge; those who contemplate them awaken to principle. They are the bridge that leads beyond birth and death and the path that enters the great Dao.\n\nThus, the *Scripture of Orthodox Unity* states: \"The Three Vehicles each cultivate the Twelve Categories.\"\n\n#### **Chapter Two: Explanation of Names**\nThe meaning of the Twelve Categories extends across the Three Vehicles. Here, we explain them in order for the Secondary Vehicle; the rest may be inferred by analogy.\n\nThe Twelve Categories are as follows:\n1. **Original Text** (Benwen)\n2. **Divine Talismans** (Shenfu)\n3. **Jade Instructions** (Yujue)\n4. **Numinous Diagrams** (Lingtu)\n5. **Genealogies and Records** (Pulu)\n6. **Precepts and Disciplines** (Jielü)\n7. **Dignified Rituals** (Weiyi)\n8. **Methods and Techniques** (Fangfa)\n9. **Various Arts** (Zhongshu)\n10. **Records and Biographies** (Jizhuan)\n11. **Hymns and Eulogies** (Zansong)\n12. **Memorials and Petitions** (Biaozou)\n\n**Original Text** refers to the writings of the Three Origins and Eight Assemblies, as well as the foundational narratives of the long passages—such is the example. The Perfected Lady of the Purple Tenuity states in *The True Traces*: \"The writings of the Three Origins and Eight Assemblies are employed by the Supreme Perfected of the Great Ultimate.\" *Original* (本) means \"beginning\" and \"root,\" for these are the origin of scriptural teachings, the root of written language, the source of attaining principle, and the foundation of all methods. *Text* (文) means \"division\" and \"principle,\" for it can distinguish the Two Modes (yin and yang) and arrange the characteristics of dharmas; it can order all affairs and elucidate the ultimate principle. Just as wood has grain, it is also called *principle*. It is further named *True Text* because the Twelve Categories all convey the True Text of the Three Vehicles. The teaching master of the Central Cavern is not included in this general meaning.\n\n**Divine Talismans** refer to the writings of dragon scripts and phoenix seal-characters, as well as the numinous traces and talismanic graphs. *Divine* (神) signifies the unfathomable, while *talisman* (符) denotes the matching of tally marks. These numinous traces possess boundless divine efficacy, benefiting sentient beings as surely as a tally matches its counterpart.\n\n**Jade Instructions** are like the commentaries of *The Venerable Master on the River* (Heshang), which explain the golden writings—such is the example. *Jade* (玉) signifies unstained purity, while *instructions* (诀) resolve doubts. Once decisively understood, no further uncertainty or defilement remains.\n\n**Numinous Diagrams** are like the images of the Five Emperors within the radiance or the diagrams of the Three Ones in their configurations—such is the example. *Numinous* (灵) means \"wondrous,\" and *diagram* (图) means \"to measure.\" They measure and depict wondrous forms to transmit them to the world below.\n\n**Genealogies and Records** are like the Three Lords described in *The Scripture of Generating the Spirit* or the Five Emperors recounted in *The Record of Fundamental Conduct*—such is the example. *Genealogy* (谱) means \"lineage,\" and *record* (录) means \"to inscribe.\" They trace the lineage of the sages to establish teachings, also outlining their origins so that beings may inscribe and uphold them.\n\n**Precepts and Disciplines** are like the examples of the Six Passions and Ten Evils. *Precepts* (戒) mean \"to release,\" \"to demarcate,\" and \"to halt,\" for they can release the bonds of myriad evils, distinguish the boundary between good and evil, and prevent all wrongdoing. *Disciplines* (律) mean \"to regulate,\" \"to straighten,\" and \"to instill fear,\" for they calculate transgressions, judge straightly without bias, and inspire awe.\n\n**Dignified Rituals** are like the models of purification rites or the protocols for invoking scriptures—such is the example. *Dignity* (威) conveys solemnity and awe, while *ritual* (仪) denotes proper standards. They also adapt flexibly to circumstances to establish dignified methods.\n\n**Methods and Techniques** are like the practices of preserving the Three Ones or restraining the po and summoning the hun—such is the example. *Method* (方) refers to direction, and *technique* (法) to regulation. Cultivation and bodily governance follow specific directions and regulations.\n\n**Various Arts** are like the transmutation of cinnabar, the refinement of minerals, or the transformation of form and concealment of radiance—such is the example. *Various* (众) means \"many,\" and *arts* (术) means \"Dao.\" They are the many paths leading to the ultimate sagely Dao.\n\n**Records and Biographies** are like the fundamental deeds of the Dao Lord or the past conduct of the August Person—such is the example. *Record* (记) means \"to inscribe,\" and *biography* (传) means \"to transmit.\" They inscribe fundamental deeds and transmit them to learners.\n\n**Hymns and Eulogies** are like the *Eulogies of the Five Perfected* or the ancient compositions of the Nine Heavens—such is the example. *Hymns* (赞) declare matters, and *eulogies* (颂) sing of virtue. Thus, the *Book of Songs* says of eulogies: \"They beautifully depict the forms of great virtue.\" They are also called *gatha-eulogies*, which are composed in four- or five-character verses.\n\n**Memorials and Petitions** are like the petitions of the Six Purifications or the supplications of the Three Assemblies—such is the example. *Memorial* (表) means \"to clarify,\" and *petition* (奏) means \"to converge.\" They clarify the heart’s affairs and converge them upward toward the great Dao.\n\nIn general, *category* (部) refers to classification, for categories distinguish meanings and group them by kind. The twelve explanations above are boundless, their distinctions and regulations profoundly interconnected, as previously explained.\n\nAmong the Twelve Categories, only the **Original Text** possesses both general and specific aspects. Since all Twelve Categories are written language—the root text for attaining principle—they are also alternative names for scriptures. As the Twelve Categories are collectively called *scriptures*, this is the general aspect of the Original Text. Within this general text, a separate category is distinguished: the *Five Chapters of True Text*, which possess the power to generate heaven and establish earth and are the root of all dharmas—this is the specific aspect of the Original Text. One cannot say that among the Twelve Categories, the Jade Instructions are a separate category, thus forming a specific aspect of Jade Instructions. The same applies to the other categories.\n\nThere are also long passages that are verses, originally called the Original Text. The scriptures of the other Two Vehicles may be understood by analogy.\n\n#### **Chapter Three: The Substance**\nThe Twelve Categories of scriptures are universally constituted by text. Upon investigation, some are named entirely after text, some entirely after the elucidation of principle, and some combine both text and principle in their names.\n\nFour sections are distinguished solely by textual names to define their substance: these are the *Original Text*, *Divine Verses*, *Talismanic Odes*, and *Numinous Diagrams*. Examining these four names, none possesses a definitive meaning; they are all constituted by text as their substance. *Numinous Diagrams*, though not textual, depict forms and images and are thus subsumed under the category of text.\n\nNext, four sections are distinguished entirely by names that elucidate principle to define their substance: these are *Dignified Observances*, *Genealogical Records*, *Biographical Accounts*, and *Memorial Petitions*. *Dignified Observances* pertain to the rules of deportment; *Genealogical Records* trace the origins of ancestral lineages; *Biographical Accounts* narrate achievements and reputations; *Memorial Petitions* reveal the intentions and deeds of the heart—thus, all are constituted by the workings of principle and phenomena.\n\nThe following four sections are distinguished by names that combine both text and principle to define their substance: these are *Precepts and Regulations*, *Jade Instructions*, *Methods*, and *Various Arts*. *Precepts and Regulations* encompass both the mind and the teachings: precepts pertain to the goodness of the mind and also extend to admonitions, while regulations involve the weighing of words and also govern the uprightness of the mind. *Jade Instructions* elucidate the principles and phenomena of the Dao. *Jade Instructions* are the textual principles and phenomena of the Dao, guiding practice and method, encompassing both text and technique. They unify the arts of the scriptures, hence their textual aspect; they comprise the calculations of collective wisdom, hence their principled aspect.\n\n**Chapter Four: Identity and Difference**\nThe identity and difference of substances may be expressed in four propositions: first, difference; second, identity; third, both identity and difference; fourth, neither identity nor difference.\n\nThe proposition of difference: these Twelve Categories all possess distinct substances. The four textual substances are separate, hence they cannot be identical. The eight functional meanings differ, each forming its own distinct category. However, though the eight functions do not depart from the four texts, the Twelve Categories are said to have distinct substances for two reasons. First, there exist four texts that lack the capacity for the eight functions. Second, from a profound perspective, if a function resides within one text, it differs in substance from the other three; if it resides within three texts, it differs in substance from the one. Thus, all are distinct.\n\nThe proposition of identity: the Twelve Categories do not depart from their universal aspect, and the *Original Text* shares a common substance.\n\nThe proposition of both identity and difference: there exist both specific and universal aspects of the *Original Text*. The specific aspect of the *Original Text* is constituted by 1,109 characters. Of these, 256 characters in their contemplative meaning resemble the substance of *Genealogical Records*, *Biographical Accounts*, and *Eulogistic Odes*; 63 characters share the substance of *Various Arts*; and 122 characters lack annotations, their meaning yet undetermined. The universal aspect of the *Original Text* refers to the ever-abiding scriptures, which are the foundational texts from which verses derive. These share a substance with the eight functions but differ in substance from the three texts. *Divine Talismans* may share a substance with *Jade Instructions*—for if the characters of a talisman are transformed into standard script within the *Jade Instructions*, the talisman and the *Jade Instructions* share the same substance. If the characters remain unaltered, even if the meaning of the talisman is understood, they do not share the same substance. The rest may be inferred by analogy. When considering the annotations of *Numinous Diagrams*, they are neither identical nor different in substance.\n\nThe proposition of neither identity nor difference: when literature and meaning are empty, there is no basis for discussing identity or difference. To summarize this principle: if identical, all are text; if different, the twelve textual and functional aspects converge, hence identity and difference cannot be definitively determined, and thus they are neither identical nor different.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Order**\nThe *Original Text* is the root of all generated dharmas and naturally occupies the foremost position. After generation, nurturance is required, hence *Divine Talismans* are next discussed. The *Eight Assemblies of Cloud Script* and the *Three Primordial Jade Characters*—without familiarity and refinement, how can they bring benefit? Thus, *Jade Instructions* are needed to explicate their principles and phenomena. Beings are dull and obtuse; merely hearing the vocal teachings, they cannot comprehend. Therefore, images are established to assist in clarification. Once the sagely merit is manifest, if not rooted in the sentiments of ancestral lineages, empty words may be falsely attributed. Thus, *Genealogical Records* are necessary to make them evident.\n\nThese five principles suffice for the generation of beings. To further their completion, one must heed warnings and precepts. When evil dharmas intermingle and corrupt, prevention must come first—hence the *Precepts and Regulations*. Having renounced the secular to enter the Dao and received the precepts as a monastic, one relies on the treasure of the master and must cultivate proper demeanor—thus, *Dignified Observances* are next elucidated. The preceding measures prevent evil, but past transgressions remain unexpiated; hence, one must perform purification rituals and repent the evils of three lifetimes. With demeanor refined and past karmic roots purified, one must advance in learning. To realize the truth of principle, one must rely on Daoist arts. The subtleties of Daoist arts are revealed in *Biographical Accounts*, which narrate the sequence of study and practice. As one’s work in learning becomes evident, one’s name is transmitted on bamboo and silk—hence, *Biographical Accounts* follow in order.\n\nFrom the generation of beings to the completion of practice, all is worthy of praise—thus, *Eulogistic Odes* come next. The preceding verbal teachings are mostly in prose and unstructured discourse; here, *Eulogistic Odes* consist of metered verses and structured phrases. With merit fulfilled and virtue perfected, one must express the intentions of the numinous mind, as in the example of reporting merits after purification rituals—hence, *Memorial Petitions* are presented. The preceding Twelve Categories elucidate transcendent practices, while subsequent *Memorial Petitions* dispel worldly calamities, such as the *Three Primordials*, *Mud and Ash*, and *Midnight and Noon Petitions for Longevity*—all pertain to memorials.\n\n**Chapter Six: Detailed Exegesis**\nThis comprises twelve layers of exegesis, the first being the exegesis of the *Original Text*. Previously, the exegesis was based on the *Cavernous Mystery*; if fully expounded, it is called the *Exegesis of Emptiness*. The *Vermilion Script of the Radiant August Emperor* and the *True Text of Sagely Responses* are but a single scripture. According to the Five Thearchs to whom they pertain, they are divided into five chapters. The thearchs and their chapters each have names, as recorded in the *Upper Scroll of the True Text*.\n\nThe August Thearch of the East, Lord of the Azure Spirit of the Flourishing Forest of Treasured Jewels, named *Lingwei Yang*, presides over the *True Text* titled *The Treasured True Cavernous Mystery of the Divine Generation*, also known as *The Eight Divine Strategies of the Eastern Mountain*.\n\nThe August Thearch of the South, Lord of the Vermilion Spirit of the Flourishing Yang of Treasured Jewels, named *Chibiao Nu*, presides over the *True Text* titled *The Heaven-Pervading Treasured Girdle of the Southern Clouds*, also known as *The Divine Incantations of the Nine Heavens* and *The Eight Divine Strategies of the Vermilion Thearch*.\n\nThe August Thearch of the Center, Lord of the Primordial Spirit of the Treasured Jewel of the Jade Mystery, named *Hanzhuniu*, presides over the *True Text* titled *The Nine Heavens’ Numinous Writ of the Treasured Kalpa of the Cavernous Clarity*, also known as *The Divine Strategies of the August Thearch of the Yellow Emperor*.\n\nThe August Thearch of the West, Lord of the Radiant Spirit of the Seven Treasures of the Golden Gate, named *Yaobaobao*, presides over the *True Text* titled *The Golden Perfection of Treasured Brilliance of the Cavernous Subtlety*, also known as *The Divine Incantations of the Western Mountain* and *The Eight Divine Strategies of the Dragon-Summoning Writ*.\n\nThe August Thearch of the North, Lord of the Fivefold Numinous Mystery of the Profound Darkness of Solitary Brilliance, named *Xieguangji*, presides over the *True Text* titled *The Primordial Spirit’s Treasured Writ of True Generation*, also known as *The Divine Incantations of the Northern Mountain* and *The Eight Divine Strategies of Heavenly Dominion*.\n\nThe *Jade Chapters of the Five Elders* are all texts of the empty cavern’s natural spontaneity. Their explication flows like a current, for their essential meaning is none other than the celestial writ.\n\nNow, broadly discussing past and present, variant texts number six in kind:\nFirst, at the initial separation of yin and yang, there were the *qi* of the Three Origins, Five Powers, and Eight Convergences, which formed the *flying celestial writ*. Later, these were compiled into the *Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal of Luminous Radiance*. Master Lu’s exegesis of the Three Powers calls them the Three Origins. Once the Three Origins were established, the Five Phases were fully present. Taking the Five Phases as positions and harmonizing the Three and Five is called the Eight Convergences, the origin of all writings. There is also the *Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal of Luminous Radiance*, wherein the *qi* of natural flying mystery coalesces in the void to form script. Each character spans a square *zhang*, originating within the Unheaven to generate and establish all things.\n\nAccording to the *True Traces* of Lady Ziwei, the Three Origins and Eight Convergences are the progenitors of all literary compositions. The *Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal* is their root and origin, the beginning of all writing. Yet Master Lu states that the Eight Convergences are the Three Powers and Five Phases, existing only after the division of the cosmos. The *Red Writ* further declares that the *Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s Red Writ* emerged prior to the Primordial Beginning. Thus, the Three Origins cannot refer to the Three Powers, nor the Five Powers to the Five Phases. These must instead be the three *qi* of the Three Treasures Venerable One, along with the Five Powers.\n\nTherefore, the *Chapter on the Generation of the Nine Heavens’ Spirits* states: “Heaven and earth, the myriad things—without the nurturance of the Three Origins and the guidance of the Nine *Qi*, none can be born.” It further says: “The Three *Qi* are the honor of heaven and earth; the Nine *Qi* are the root of the myriad things.” Thus, the Three Origins existed before the opening of heaven and earth and the birth of the Three Powers.\n\nOne school, following Master Song’s method, holds that the Eight Convergences are merely the Three Origins and Five Powers. The Three Origins are: first, the *qi* of the *Hundun Taiwu* of the Primordial Lofty Jade Void; second, the *qi* of the *Chihun Taiwu* of the Supreme Purple Void; third, the *qi* of the *Mingji Xuantong* of the Primordial Supreme Clear Void. The Five Powers derive from three: yin, yang, and harmony. Yin comprises lesser yin and greater yin; yang comprises lesser yang and greater yang. The harmony within harmony constitutes the Five Powers.\n\nThe term *seal* refers to compilation, while *cloud writ* is called *cloud seal*. These—the Three Origins and Eight Convergences, the *Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal*—are all celestial writ. The Three Origins and Eight Convergences correspond to the example of the five texts and eight characters. The *Cloud Seal of Luminous Radiance* corresponds to the examples of the *Five Talismans* and *Five Victories*. The original text of the Eight Convergences totals 1,109 characters. The *Five Chapters of the True Writ* comprise 668 characters, which are the primordial roots of the Three Powers, generating heaven, establishing earth, transforming humans and spirits, and giving rise to the myriad things. Hence, it is said there are the Dao of heaven, the Dao of earth, the Dao of spirits, and the Dao of humans—this is what is meant.\n\nThe *Jade Exegesis* states that in practicing this method, the Five Chapters are divided by character count, each with four applications:\n1. To summon the Nine Heavens’ Thearchs, verify the registers of divine immortals, and seek transcendence to attain perfection;\n2. To summon the stellar officials of the celestial lodges, rectify the celestial divisions, and secure the state and pacify the people;\n3. To subdue the Six Heavens of Fengdu, wherein the Inner Tone Heaven possesses a *qi* of eight characters;\n4. To command the Water Thearch and summon or restrain dragons and fish.\n\nWithin the various heavens, the Inner Tone Heaven has eight characters, and the thirty-two heavens together comprise 256 characters. These expound the celestial degrees, the great assemblies of sages, the names and titles of perfected immortals, the palaces and bureaus they govern, the terraces and cities of their abodes, the transformations and ascents of immortals, the ranks of their ascent, the kinds of demons, the life and death of humans and ghosts, and the causes and conditions of the turning wheel. The sixty-three characters are the names of the primordial essences of the five directions, methods for ingesting and refining to seek transcendence, refining the spirit to transform the body, and ascending to the void in the white moon. The remaining 122 characters lack phonetic explanations.\n\nSecond, the Eight Convergences are rendered into dragon and phoenix script, called *earthly tone* or *earthly writ*. All below this are writings transmitted by the mysterious sages to transcribe celestial texts.\n\nThird, during the time of the Yellow Thearch, Cang Jie, observing the forms of dragons and phoenixes and gathering bird tracks, created ancient script to replace knotted cords, embodying their shapes.\n\nFourth, during the Zhou dynasty, Scribe Zhou altered ancient script into greater seal script.\n\nFifth, during the Qin dynasty, Li Si transformed greater seal script into lesser seal script.\n\nSixth, after the Qin, Cheng Miao altered lesser seal script into clerical script. Some say clerical script is called *assistant script*, for Cheng Miao created it while imprisoned, emerging to manage convict laborers, hence the name *clerical*.\n\nThese constitute the six.\n\nWithin the second category, there is also the *Cloud Seal of Luminous Radiance*, which, following its forms, became Brahmi script, further divided into sixty-four kinds. Disseminated across the thirty-six heavens, scriptures were transmitted, all explained through clerical characters to interpret celestial writ, each proceeding independently.\n\nThe first transmission of ancient script was by Handan Chun. There were also eight styles:\n1. Greater seal script,\n2. Lesser seal script,\n3. Engraved talisman script,\n4. Worm script,\n5. Seal-impression script,\n6. Signboard script,\n7. *Shu* script,\n8. Clerical script.\n\nDuring Wang Mang’s reign, the Minister of Education Zhen Feng was tasked with standardizing script, and six further categories were established:\n1. Ancient script, the texts from Confucius’ wall;\n\nSecond, *odd characters*, those ancient and unusual;\nThird, *seal script*;\nFourth, *assisting script*, which is clerical script;\nFifth, *border seal*, used for seal impressions;\nSixth, *bird seal*, used for writing banners.\n\nWhen Cang Jie first created writing, brushes must already have existed. The *Book of Songs* speaks of \"vermilion tubes,\" which were indeed brushes. Yet it is said that Meng Tian invented the brush—Meng Tian, a general of Qin, whose three generations were renowned, crafted brushes with such precision and skill that he alone claimed this extraordinary fame.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor He of Han, Cai Lun first created paper; before this, only bamboo slips and wooden tablets were used. *Tablets* recorded events in detail, while *slips* were brief, lest the text become too cumbersome. Yet it is known that originally, celestial writ was inscribed on golden tablets. The remaining eight styles and six scripts all derive from the true origin, though external scholars may further elaborate on these.\n\nIt is unknown when this scripture was first transcribed onto paper and made into scrolls. Yet one must consider: if brushes existed from the beginning of the kalpa, and the Supreme Perfected inscribed the text, how could there be no paper, nor the eight styles and six scripts? This is to honor the workings of creation, for the Dao encompasses all methods. Later generations merely followed and applied them, with differences only in sequence.\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of Spirit Talismans (Second Section)**\n\nAll myriad methods rely upon the use of refined *qi*. Thus, the Two Modes and Three Luminaries all operate through refined *qi* within them; once the ten thousand things exist, they too are governed by refined *qi*. Therefore, the Five Phases and Six Substances all possess refined *qi*.\n\nBy spreading the Dao’s refined *qi* onto bamboo and ink, and uniting it with the refined *qi* of things, one repels deceit, aids the true and real, summons and assembles the host of spirits, governs life and death, safeguards the kalpa’s course, and pacifies and stabilizes the Five Directions.\n\nThese talismanic characters originate from the structuring of emptiness. The Supreme Perfected, gazing upward, transcribed celestial patterns, arranging them by direction and distinguishing between diagrams, talismans, and script. *Talismans* universally adopt the forms of clouds, phenomena, and celestial bodies; *script* separately analyzes sounds, phrases, and measured meanings; *diagrams* depict the configurations of numinous transformations.\n\nYet within talismans there is script, interspersed with eight diagrams; within script there are diagrams, employing both form and sound. Thus, the eight styles and six scripts mutually elucidate one another.\n\nThe six scripts are:\n1. *Pictographs*, such as the sun and moon;\n2. *Indicatives*, such as \"above\" and \"below\";\n3. *Phono-semantic compounds*, such as \"river\" and \"stream\";\n4. *Associative compounds*, such as \"martial\" and \"trust\";\n5. *Mutually explanatory characters*, such as \"elder\" and \"aged\";\n6. *Phonetic loans*, such as \"command\" and \"chief.\"\n\nThe eight styles are:\n1. *Celestial script*, the Eight Convergences;\n2. *Divine script*, cloud seal;\n3. *Earthly script*, the forms of dragons and phoenixes;\n4. *Inner script*, that which dragons, turtles, fish, and birds disgorge;\n5. *Outer script*, borne by scales, shells, feathers, and wings;\n6. *Demonic script*, miscellaneous and subtle forms;\n7. *Xia script*, modeled on cloud seal;\n8. *Barbarian script*, resembling insects and worms.\n\nThese six scripts and eight styles sometimes share modern and ancient forms, or ancient forms and talismans, mutually augmenting and diminishing to constitute a single method, unified in function. Thus, their similarities and differences are not fixed.\n\nIn the Three Caverns scriptures, talismans may appear in modern characters, for even in the *Old Text Documents of the Zhou* there are instances where ancient and modern characters coincide.\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of Jade Formulas (Third Section)**\n\nThere are two additional scrolls of scripture. The Supreme Dao Lord, at the Upper Observatory of Vermilion Yang in the Southern Cavern, expounded these numinous texts and jade-character formulas to the scholar Wang Long. However, it is unknown to which dynasty the annotations definitively belong; scholars must investigate this.\n\nThese texts also discuss methods for cultivation, talismanic diagrams of the Five Directions, visualization, and disaster aversion. They precisely elucidate the Eight Convergences, while within the original text’s principles, further clarifications emerge—such as the principles of resonance and communication in the explanation of the *True Writ*, or the subtle meanings of focused intention in *Stabilizing the Will*. Matters contain further matters, as in the jade formulas, which also clarify the transmission of scriptures and the rituals of covenant bestowal.\n\nAll explanations within the formulas are collectively termed *jade formulas*.\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of Numinous Diagrams (Fourth Section)**\n\nThe creation of diagrams and texts arises from form and sound. As for the works of the dark sages, each serves a distinct function. *Diagrams* transmit the manifest; *texts* transmit the unmanifest. The *unmanifest* refers to words and principles without form or trace, as in the examples of *Stabilizing the Will* and *Dwelling in Seclusion*. The *manifest* refers to that which has form and trace, as in the Eight Luminaries and the examples of humans and birds.\n\nTexts and diagrams may also bridge the manifest and unmanifest, as previously discussed in the context of contemplation. Some are buried within the Five Peaks to safeguard the kalpa’s course; others are disseminated across the Ten Directions to universally transform and enlighten. Some are concealed in golden caskets to demonstrate the solemnity of celestial patterns; others are hidden in famous mountains, to be revealed only upon proper assembly. Some are inscribed upon palace gates, installed wherever one travels; others are written in empty groves to display the power of spiritual penetration. Some circulate through the Five States to mark karmic suitability; others reach the Three Clarities to distinguish the destinies of ascent and descent. Some were proclaimed in high antiquity to rescue beings from delusion; others are transmitted to later ages to alleviate the suffering of beings.\n\nAll these stem from the virtue of great compassion, prescribing remedies according to affliction, and the heart of great mercy, expounding the Dao in response to conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of Genealogies and Records (Fifth Section)**\n\nExamples include the *Three Treasure Lords* preceding the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit*, and the *Dao Lord’s* own account of his past-life roots in the *Fundamental Practice*.\n\n*Records* systematically distinguish deities, their ranks, names, and titles, as in the examples of the Eight Luminaries and inner sounds. *Genealogies* serve to elucidate the principles of existence and cessation for sentient beings, which arise and vanish in an instant, like grass and trees, without apparent cause. Thus, they recount past-life origins to awaken understanding.\n\nRecords also systematically list names and titles, bestowed upon disciples to guide their contemplation and self-protection, ensuring the preservation of the human body for ascent to heaven. The *Great Cavern*’s teachings exemplify the *Jade Records of the Supreme Sovereign*.\n\n**Chapter on Interpreting Precepts and Disciplines**\n\n**Sixth: On Precepts and Disciplines**\nPrecepts (*jie fa*) are the cessation of evil. \"Cessation\" means restraining the mind and speech from wrongdoing, vowing never to commit evil. The meaning of precepts may be detailed or concise.\n\nDetailed precepts include: the *Taiqing*’s foundational Dao with its boundless dharma gates of one hundred twenty-nine articles; the *Lord Lao*’s and *Three Primes’ Precepts* of one hundred eighty articles; the *Great Precepts on Contemplating the Body* of three hundred articles; and the *Taiyi*’s sixty precepts.\n\nConcise precepts include: the Daoist’s Three Precepts, the *Recorded Lives*’ Five Precepts, the Libationer’s Eight Precepts, the *Xianger*’s Nine Precepts, the *Wisdom’s Upper Grade*’s Ten Precepts, and the *Mingzhen Regulations*’ Twenty-Four Precepts.\n\nDisciplines (*lü*) emerge from precepts without separate categories, primarily addressing the statutes of karmic retribution, as seen in the Celestial Master Lord Lao’s *Xuandu Disciplines* and the *Nüqing Disciplines*.\n\nThus, precepts govern causes, while disciplines govern effects; precepts prevent evil, while disciplines address transgressions. Whether descending from the void or transmitted orally, all adapt to the recipient’s capacity, with variations in conferral.\n\nFor instance, in the *Upper Grade Precepts*, the disciple faces east; in the *Fixed Resolve Precepts*, the disciple faces south; in the *Golden Register Simplified Texts*, the Heavenly Worthy faces north.\n\nFacing east aligns with the sun’s position. According to the *Three Primes’ Precepts*, the eastern and southern directions are left-official realms, belonging to *Taiyang*; the western and northern directions are right-official realms, belonging to *Taiyin*. First, one repents sins and seeks deliverance, thus facing *Taiyin* (north) and bowing to the ten directions. Next, one requests life and seeks meaning, thus facing *Taiyang* (east) to receive the precepts.\n\nIn the *Fixed Resolve* teachings, the dharma master resides in the south while the disciple faces the master, bowing with their head turned toward them. Logically, the dharma master often faces north, as in the *Golden Register*. In the *Upper Grade Precepts*, the disciple faces east; in the *Fixed Resolve Precepts*, the disciple faces south—both direct the disciple toward the *qi* of life.\n\nOne may ask: In the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* and the *Twenty-Four Lives Diagram*, the dharma master faces south or north, differing from these examples. What is the reason?\n\nThe answer: In those scriptures, the Heavenly Worthy personally commanded the Three Heavenly Perfected Ones to transmit the *Twenty-Four Lives Diagram* to the Dao Lord, and ordered the Nine Heavens’ Marshal and Jade Attendant Immortal to transmit the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* to the Flying Heaven Spirit King. At that time, the Flying Heaven Spirit King and the Dao Lord faced north to petition the Heavenly Worthy. The messengers, bearing the Heavenly Worthy’s command, came from his side to confer the texts. These were transmissions of scriptures, distinct from the conferral of precepts, and thus cannot serve as precedents.\n\n**Seventh: On Interpreting Ritual Demeanor**\nThe Three Primes originally possessed three thousand four hundred standards of ritual demeanor—postures and movements. After the Dragon Han era, many texts became incomplete. Today, only two hundred forty remain, as later generations were deemed unworthy, and the rest were not transmitted.\n\n**On the Merits of Fasts and Offerings**\nFormer Song masters listed six categories; our school now clarifies two: *Ultimate Dao* and *Deliverance*.\n\n*Ultimate Dao*: As the *Scripture of Cavernous Spirit* states, \"Fasting the mind and sitting in forgetfulness—this is the Ultimate Dao.\"\n\n*Deliverance*: According to the scriptures, there are three registers and seven grades.\n\nThe *Three Registers* are:\n1. *Golden Register Fast*: Dispels celestial calamities and safeguards the emperor.\n2. *Jade Register Fast*: Delivers the people, beseeching blessings and repenting transgressions.\n3. *Yellow Register Fast*: Liberates those suffering in the earth prisons and the Nine Dark realms.\n\nThe *Seven Grades* are:\n1. *Three Sovereigns Fast*: Seeks immortality and protects the state.\n2. *Natural Fast*: Cultivates truth and harmonizes with the Dao.\n3. *Upper Clarity Fast*: Ascends to the void and enters the subtle.\n4. *Instruction Fast*: Averts disasters and heals illnesses.\n5. *Mud and Ashes Fast*: Repents transgressions and pleads for life.\n6. *Illuminating Truth Fast*: Rescues souls from the dark night.\n7. *Three Primes Fast*: Repents sins before the Three Officials.\n\nThese fasts may last one day and night, three days and nights, or seven days and nights, each with its own ritual procedures.\n\nAdditionally, there are the Six Fasts, Ten Upright Days, Jiazi, Gengshen, Eight Nodal Days, Life-Destiny Days, Hundred-Day, Thousand-Day Fasts, and others, all employing natural methods.\n\nThe *Six Fast Months* are the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh lunar months. The *Three Long Fast Months* are the first, seventh, and tenth lunar months.\n\nThe *Ten Upright Days* are the first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of the lunar month.\n\nThe *Eight Nodal Days* are the *Beginning of Spring*, *Spring Equinox*, *Beginning of Summer*, *Summer Solstice*, *Beginning of Autumn*, *Autumn Equinox*, *Beginning of Winter*, and *Winter Solstice*.\n\nFurther distinctions among these fast days will not be elaborated here.\n\n**Eighth: On Interpreting Methods**\n\nThe former teachings broadly outline nine methods: first, coarse food; second, vegetable food; third, moderated food; fourth, consuming essences; fifth, consuming sprouts; sixth, consuming light; seventh, consuming qi; eighth, primordial qi; and ninth, embryonic nourishment.\n\nCoarse food refers to hemp and wheat; vegetable food refers to greens and eggplants; moderated food refers to balanced meals; consuming essences refers to talismanic water and cinnabar elixirs; consuming sprouts refers to the cloud-sprouts of the five directions; consuming light refers to the sun, moon, Seven Origins, and Three Luminaries; consuming qi refers to the qi of the six senses and the wondrous qi of heaven, earth, and the four directions; consuming primordial qi refers to all that is endowed with the qi of the Three Origins, the essence of Great Harmony, abiding in the Great Void; embryonic nourishment refers to the harmony of one’s own original essence, the origin of the embryonic sac, where pure emptiness descends as qi through the four limbs, no longer dependent on external sources.\n\nCoarse food curbs all indulgent cravings; vegetable food moderates rich and fatty foods; moderated food eliminates vexation and turbidity; consuming essences refines the body and spirit into radiant splendor; consuming sprouts transforms one into sprouts; consuming light transforms one into light; consuming the six qi transforms one into the six qi, roaming the ten directions; consuming primordial qi transforms one into primordial qi, merging with heaven and earth as one body; consuming embryonic qi reverts one to an infant, blending with the Dao as one.\n\nThrough these transformations, the workings of destiny are altered, and one no longer awaits the abandonment of the body to receive a new form or undergo the cycles of life and death. The present interpretation of methods need not be limited to matters of diet; they may also involve medicinal formulas, massage, and other practices.\n\n**Ninth: On Interpreting the Myriad Techniques**\n\nAll techniques are interconnected. Broadly speaking, there are five practices: first, contemplating the spirit and preserving the true; second, fasting the mind and sitting in forgetfulness; third, pacing the void and soaring through space; fourth, ingesting and absorbing primordial qi; and fifth, guiding and drawing in the Three Luminaries. These all involve the mind and qi working in concert, enabling the spirit and Dao to communicate in hidden harmony.\n\nRegarding their transformations, there are three kinds: first, ascending to heaven in broad daylight; second, liberation through the corpse; and third, extinction where the form remains unharmed.\n\nAscending to heaven in broad daylight occurs when merit is perfected and the Dao is complete, when the thirty-six thousand spirits, the Three Ones, and the Imperial One merge into one body, and the body attains wondrous unity. Thus, one can ascend to heaven with the spirits in the same form. Alternatively, by reciting the *Great Cavern Scripture* and the *Human-Bird Mountain*, one may be welcomed by cloud chariots without the need for ingestion, for the body has already transformed and ascends to the Vermilion Numinosity to receive refinement.\n\nLiberation through the corpse follows the principles of rank and karma. Extinction, as in the case of the Great One guarding the corpse, may last for years, after which the corpse revives as a person.\n\n**Tenth: On Records and Biographies**\n\nRecords trace the events of the past, while biographies may also foretell future events. The bodies of all sages and spirits arise from two sources: first, natural attainment, and second, cultivation.\n\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* speaks of progressing from death to life, from life to the Dao, from the Dao to immortality, from immortality to perfection, and from perfection to becoming the Supreme Clarity Yellow Elder Lord, such as the Thirty-Nine Perfected, the Twenty-Four Emperors, the One Hundred Eighty Dao Lords, and the Heavenly Worthies. Some of these exalted beings arise from natural wondrous qi and spontaneous transformation, while others achieve this through cultivation. The natural and the cultivated merge as one.\n\nThough the ranks of these sages and perfected beings number in the myriad grades, the general meaning is as described in the principles of rank and karma. The *Seven Perfected and Arrayed Records*, the biographies of the Dao Lords, and other genealogical records fall into this category.\n\n**Eleventh: On Hymns and Eulogies**\n\nFour-character verses correspond to the four seasons and four qi; five-character verses align with the five phases and five virtues; seven-character verses correspond to the Seven Origins and Seven Luminaries. These include original hymns and eulogies, such as those in the *Nine Heavens’ Generation of the Spirit*, which employ the flying and mysterious qi of the Three Caverns as their foundation.\n\nIn later scriptures, there may be hymns and eulogies composed by Dao Lords, Perfected Ones, and various heavenly beings. These are all works of the mysterious sages, included within the scriptures.\n\nThough the jade characters of celestial texts originally derive from Sanskrit sounds, when teaching and expounding scriptures, they are understood according to their categories. For instance, the writing of true texts originates from the Sanskrit of the Three Origins and Eight Assemblies of Brahma Heaven. Today, using clerical script and translating these sounds into written form preserves both seal and clerical scripts, making the translation manifest while the Sanskrit remains hidden. In the *Nine Heavens’ Generation of the Spirit Chapter*, the original text is not transmitted, nor are the Sanskrit sounds revealed; only the clerical script and its sounds remain.\n\nAs for the *Inner Sounds and Jade Characters*, there are similarities and differences. The similarity lies in transmitting seal script through clerical script; the difference is that the sounds are not translated from Sanskrit, rendering the text’s singularity or complexity incomprehensible. Yet when the Heavenly Perfected and August Ones expound upon it, they still employ the great Sanskrit sounds to articulate these matters, aligning this world’s phenomena with the affairs of the Mystic Capital. Thus, it is known that the sounds of the true sages can universally apply to all things.\n\n**Twelfth: On Memorials and Petitions**\n\nThis section pertains primarily to the Orthodox Unity tradition. Though all myriad affairs differ in their manifestations, the sages established methods to regulate them through specific practices.\n\nThe Dao resides in the human heart, yet memorials and petitions are necessary because, when direct mystical union is unattainable, one relies on affairs to make it manifest. When affairs are made manifest, the heart becomes clear, and thus the outward forms are fully expressed.\n\nThe human heart has no substance, yet when set in motion, it encounters circumstances. When circumstances are purified, the heart becomes clear; when the heart is clear, conduct becomes pure. Pure conduct enables communion with the divine, and a clear heart enables union with the Dao of heaven. Thus, ascending the altar to make vows, relying on memorials and petitions, reveals both heart and form, fully uniting the human and the divine.\n\nThe *Regulations on Chapter Pledges* states: offering goods demonstrates sincerity; sincerity in the Dao involves relinquishing wealth to dispel calamities and disperse misfortune. There are many names for this, but its essentials are three: first, bestowing upon common people, extending even to birds, beasts, creeping insects, and flying creatures, all equally receiving alms; second, making offerings to the three ranks, adorning and honoring the Three Treasures, and providing for sages and worthies, collectively called *supply and support*.\n\n**Clarifying the Teachings (First)**\n\nTo clarify the teachings is to elucidate the meaning of the thirty-six divisions. Within the Three Vehicles, each vehicle possesses its own first twelve divisions, thus combining to form thirty-six. Regarding their mutual inclusion: the Great Vehicle encompasses all thirty-six divisions, the Middle Vehicle comprises twenty-four, and the Lesser Vehicle only twelve. Why is this so? Because the Great may subsume the Small. Moreover, the Great Vehicle may be studied comprehensively, while the Small cannot encompass the Great, being limited to twelve; the Middle Vehicle may be inferred accordingly. This broadly addresses the intent of the *Inner Transformation Gate for Men*.\n\nIn discussing the Three Caverns, it is to unite the preceding Three Vehicles into this One Vehicle—thus, the Three Caverns ultimately belong to the One Great Vehicle. Yet, when the Three Caverns are further divided into three, it is to demonstrate that within the One Vehicle, nothing is left unencompassed. Hence, what follows clarifies that three also reveals one, three is not three, and three-one is neither one nor three—this is the orthodox meaning.\n\n**Question:** In unifying the three into one, do the Three Vehicles remain?\n**Answer:** They are fundamentally neither present nor absent. If absent, what is there to unify? If present, why speak of unification?\n\n---\n\n**Cultivating Conduct (Second)**\n\nThere are two scriptures that differ in their exposition:\n\n**First,** *The Natural Rites of the Supreme Mystery Capital and Laozi* states that the Mystery Scripture comprises three sections:\n1. The *Scripture of Heaven*, cultivated by celestial perfected beings;\n2. The *Scripture of Earth*, practiced in the grotto-heavens;\n3. The *Scripture of Man*, followed in the world.\n\nThe methods of these three realms interpenetrate, and each category is called the Three Vehicles. The application of the Three Vehicles each consists of twelve principles, which interweave and interconnect, collectively termed the thirty-six divisions. The twelve principles are:\n1. Non-action;\n2. Action;\n3. Non-action yet action;\n4. Action yet non-action;\n5. Continuing attachment;\n6. Severing attachment;\n7. Neither severing nor continuing;\n8. Segmented existence;\n9. Non-segmented existence;\n10. Discerning the subtle;\n11. Discerning the manifest;\n12. Universal application.\n\nIn terms of the realm, these are also called the twelve divisions. When both the hidden and manifest are employed, there are seventy-two divisions. Here, the preceding three scriptures are referred to as teachings in themselves, while the latter twelve principles pertain to conduct.\n\n**Second,** the *Orthodox Unity* expounds twelve principles as follows:\n1. Both mind and traces in non-action;\n2. Mind in non-action, traces in action;\n3. Mind in action, traces in non-action;\n4. Abandoning the household to dwell among people;\n5. Bringing the household into rivers and marshes;\n6. Leaving the world, isolated from others;\n7. Harmonizing with the world, blending with the dust;\n8. Severing desires to sever them utterly;\n9. Not severing;\n10. Roaming the void;\n11. Dwelling beneath the earth;\n12. Abiding in the heavens.\n\nEach of the Three Vehicles possesses twelve, thus forming thirty-six. The general explication of this text has already been addressed in the *Meaning of Ranks and Practices*.\n\nThe disparity in the names and flavors of these two scriptures lies in their distinct approaches to teaching. The *Supreme Mystery* primarily grounds its exposition in the mind, while the *Orthodox Unity* comprehensively discusses both mind and traces. In the *Supreme Mystery*’s twelve principles, the eighth—*segmented existence*—pertains to matters involving traces and is thus manifest.\n\n*The Great Meaning of the Cavern Mystery and Numinous Treasure’s Gate of Mystery concludes here.* (Note: Before *Boundless*, there appears to be missing text. The character *二* was originally miswritten as *一* and has been corrected.)",

      "translated_text": "**The Profound Principles of the Numinous Treasure’s Mysterious Gate**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Profound Principles of the Numinous Treasure’s Mysterious Gate* (Dongxuan Lingbao Xuemen Dayi). Also known as *The Great Treatise of the Mysterious Gate* (Xuemen Dalun) or *The Great Treatise of the Daoist Gate* (Daomen Dalun). The author is unknown, though it likely emerged between the Sui and Tang dynasties. According to the *Catalogue of Missing Scriptures in the Daoist Canon*, the original text comprised twenty scrolls, of which only one now remains. The base text is derived from the *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Taiping Section. See also *The Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel*, Scroll Six.\n\n---\n\n### **The Profound Principles of the Numinous Treasure’s Mysterious Gate**\n\n#### **Chapter One: The Orthodox Meaning**\nThe Twelve Categories of Scriptures are the wondrous canon that unites the Three Vehicles and encompasses the grand principles of the Seven Divisions. Those who study them attain true knowledge; those who contemplate them awaken to principle. They are the bridge that leads beyond birth and death and the path that enters the great Dao.\n\nThus, the *Scripture of Orthodox Unity* states: \"The Three Vehicles each cultivate the Twelve Categories.\"\n\n#### **Chapter Two: Explanation of Names**\nThe meaning of the Twelve Categories extends across the Three Vehicles. Here, we explain them in order for the Secondary Vehicle; the rest may be inferred by analogy.\n\nThe Twelve Categories are as follows:\n1. **Original Text** (Benwen)\n2. **Divine Talismans** (Shenfu)\n3. **Jade Instructions** (Yujue)\n4. **Numinous Diagrams** (Lingtu)\n5. **Genealogies and Records** (Pulu)\n6. **Precepts and Disciplines** (Jielü)\n7. **Dignified Rituals** (Weiyi)\n8. **Methods and Techniques** (Fangfa)\n9. **Various Arts** (Zhongshu)\n10. **Records and Biographies** (Jizhuan)\n11. **Hymns and Eulogies** (Zansong)\n12. **Memorials and Petitions** (Biaozou)\n\n**Original Text** refers to the writings of the Three Origins and Eight Assemblies, as well as the foundational narratives of the long passages—such is the example. The Perfected Lady of the Purple Tenuity states in *The True Traces*: \"The writings of the Three Origins and Eight Assemblies are employed by the Supreme Perfected of the Great Ultimate.\" *Original* (本) means \"beginning\" and \"root,\" for these are the origin of scriptural teachings, the root of written language, the source of attaining principle, and the foundation of all methods. *Text* (文) means \"division\" and \"principle,\" for it can distinguish the Two Modes (yin and yang) and arrange the characteristics of dharmas; it can order all affairs and elucidate the ultimate principle. Just as wood has grain, it is also called *principle*. It is further named *True Text* because the Twelve Categories all convey the True Text of the Three Vehicles. The teaching master of the Central Cavern is not included in this general meaning.\n\n**Divine Talismans** refer to the writings of dragon scripts and phoenix seal-characters, as well as the numinous traces and talismanic graphs. *Divine* (神) signifies the unfathomable, while *talisman* (符) denotes the matching of tally marks. These numinous traces possess boundless divine efficacy, benefiting sentient beings as surely as a tally matches its counterpart.\n\n**Jade Instructions** are like the commentaries of *The Venerable Master on the River* (Heshang), which explain the golden writings—such is the example. *Jade* (玉) signifies unstained purity, while *instructions* (诀) resolve doubts. Once decisively understood, no further uncertainty or defilement remains.\n\n**Numinous Diagrams** are like the images of the Five Emperors within the radiance or the diagrams of the Three Ones in their configurations—such is the example. *Numinous* (灵) means \"wondrous,\" and *diagram* (图) means \"to measure.\" They measure and depict wondrous forms to transmit them to the world below.\n\n**Genealogies and Records** are like the Three Lords described in *The Scripture of Generating the Spirit* or the Five Emperors recounted in *The Record of Fundamental Conduct*—such is the example. *Genealogy* (谱) means \"lineage,\" and *record* (录) means \"to inscribe.\" They trace the lineage of the sages to establish teachings, also outlining their origins so that beings may inscribe and uphold them.\n\n**Precepts and Disciplines** are like the examples of the Six Passions and Ten Evils. *Precepts* (戒) mean \"to release,\" \"to demarcate,\" and \"to halt,\" for they can release the bonds of myriad evils, distinguish the boundary between good and evil, and prevent all wrongdoing. *Disciplines* (律) mean \"to regulate,\" \"to straighten,\" and \"to instill fear,\" for they calculate transgressions, judge straightly without bias, and inspire awe.\n\n**Dignified Rituals** are like the models of purification rites or the protocols for invoking scriptures—such is the example. *Dignity* (威) conveys solemnity and awe, while *ritual* (仪) denotes proper standards. They also adapt flexibly to circumstances to establish dignified methods.\n\n**Methods and Techniques** are like the practices of preserving the Three Ones or restraining the po and summoning the hun—such is the example. *Method* (方) refers to direction, and *technique* (法) to regulation. Cultivation and bodily governance follow specific directions and regulations.\n\n**Various Arts** are like the transmutation of cinnabar, the refinement of minerals, or the transformation of form and concealment of radiance—such is the example. *Various* (众) means \"many,\" and *arts* (术) means \"Dao.\" They are the many paths leading to the ultimate sagely Dao.\n\n**Records and Biographies** are like the fundamental deeds of the Dao Lord or the past conduct of the August Person—such is the example. *Record* (记) means \"to inscribe,\" and *biography* (传) means \"to transmit.\" They inscribe fundamental deeds and transmit them to learners.\n\n**Hymns and Eulogies** are like the *Eulogies of the Five Perfected* or the ancient compositions of the Nine Heavens—such is the example. *Hymns* (赞) declare matters, and *eulogies* (颂) sing of virtue. Thus, the *Book of Songs* says of eulogies: \"They beautifully depict the forms of great virtue.\" They are also called *gatha-eulogies*, which are composed in four- or five-character verses.\n\n**Memorials and Petitions** are like the petitions of the Six Purifications or the supplications of the Three Assemblies—such is the example. *Memorial* (表) means \"to clarify,\" and *petition* (奏) means \"to converge.\" They clarify the heart’s affairs and converge them upward toward the great Dao.\n\nIn general, *category* (部) refers to classification, for categories distinguish meanings and group them by kind. The twelve explanations above are boundless, their distinctions and regulations profoundly interconnected, as previously explained.\n\nAmong the Twelve Categories, only the **Original Text** possesses both general and specific aspects. Since all Twelve Categories are written language—the root text for attaining principle—they are also alternative names for scriptures. As the Twelve Categories are collectively called *scriptures*, this is the general aspect of the Original Text. Within this general text, a separate category is distinguished: the *Five Chapters of True Text*, which possess the power to generate heaven and establish earth and are the root of all dharmas—this is the specific aspect of the Original Text. One cannot say that among the Twelve Categories, the Jade Instructions are a separate category, thus forming a specific aspect of Jade Instructions. The same applies to the other categories.\n\nThere are also long passages that are verses, originally called the Original Text. The scriptures of the other Two Vehicles may be understood by analogy.\n\n#### **Chapter Three: The Substance**\nThe Twelve Categories of scriptures are universally constituted by text. Upon investigation, some are named entirely after text, some entirely after the elucidation of principle, and some combine both text and principle in their names.",

      "translated_text": "Four sections are distinguished solely by textual names to define their substance: these are the *Original Text*, *Divine Verses*, *Talismanic Odes*, and *Numinous Diagrams*. Examining these four names, none possesses a definitive meaning; they are all constituted by text as their substance. *Numinous Diagrams*, though not textual, depict forms and images and are thus subsumed under the category of text.\n\nNext, four sections are distinguished entirely by names that elucidate principle to define their substance: these are *Dignified Observances*, *Genealogical Records*, *Biographical Accounts*, and *Memorial Petitions*. *Dignified Observances* pertain to the rules of deportment; *Genealogical Records* trace the origins of ancestral lineages; *Biographical Accounts* narrate achievements and reputations; *Memorial Petitions* reveal the intentions and deeds of the heart—thus, all are constituted by the workings of principle and phenomena.\n\nThe following four sections are distinguished by names that combine both text and principle to define their substance: these are *Precepts and Regulations*, *Jade Instructions*, *Methods*, and *Various Arts*. *Precepts and Regulations* encompass both the mind and the teachings: precepts pertain to the goodness of the mind and also extend to admonitions, while regulations involve the weighing of words and also govern the uprightness of the mind. *Jade Instructions* elucidate the principles and phenomena of the Dao. *Jade Instructions* are the textual principles and phenomena of the Dao, guiding practice and method, encompassing both text and technique. They unify the arts of the scriptures, hence their textual aspect; they comprise the calculations of collective wisdom, hence their principled aspect.\n\n**Chapter Four: Identity and Difference**\nThe identity and difference of substances may be expressed in four propositions: first, difference; second, identity; third, both identity and difference; fourth, neither identity nor difference.\n\nThe proposition of difference: these Twelve Categories all possess distinct substances. The four textual substances are separate, hence they cannot be identical. The eight functional meanings differ, each forming its own distinct category. However, though the eight functions do not depart from the four texts, the Twelve Categories are said to have distinct substances for two reasons. First, there exist four texts that lack the capacity for the eight functions. Second, from a profound perspective, if a function resides within one text, it differs in substance from the other three; if it resides within three texts, it differs in substance from the one. Thus, all are distinct.\n\nThe proposition of identity: the Twelve Categories do not depart from their universal aspect, and the *Original Text* shares a common substance.\n\nThe proposition of both identity and difference: there exist both specific and universal aspects of the *Original Text*. The specific aspect of the *Original Text* is constituted by 1,109 characters. Of these, 256 characters in their contemplative meaning resemble the substance of *Genealogical Records*, *Biographical Accounts*, and *Eulogistic Odes*; 63 characters share the substance of *Various Arts*; and 122 characters lack annotations, their meaning yet undetermined. The universal aspect of the *Original Text* refers to the ever-abiding scriptures, which are the foundational texts from which verses derive. These share a substance with the eight functions but differ in substance from the three texts. *Divine Talismans* may share a substance with *Jade Instructions*—for if the characters of a talisman are transformed into standard script within the *Jade Instructions*, the talisman and the *Jade Instructions* share the same substance. If the characters remain unaltered, even if the meaning of the talisman is understood, they do not share the same substance. The rest may be inferred by analogy. When considering the annotations of *Numinous Diagrams*, they are neither identical nor different in substance.\n\nThe proposition of neither identity nor difference: when literature and meaning are empty, there is no basis for discussing identity or difference. To summarize this principle: if identical, all are text; if different, the twelve textual and functional aspects converge, hence identity and difference cannot be definitively determined, and thus they are neither identical nor different.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Order**\nThe *Original Text* is the root of all generated dharmas and naturally occupies the foremost position. After generation, nurturance is required, hence *Divine Talismans* are next discussed. The *Eight Assemblies of Cloud Script* and the *Three Primordial Jade Characters*—without familiarity and refinement, how can they bring benefit? Thus, *Jade Instructions* are needed to explicate their principles and phenomena. Beings are dull and obtuse; merely hearing the vocal teachings, they cannot comprehend. Therefore, images are established to assist in clarification. Once the sagely merit is manifest, if not rooted in the sentiments of ancestral lineages, empty words may be falsely attributed. Thus, *Genealogical Records* are necessary to make them evident.\n\nThese five principles suffice for the generation of beings. To further their completion, one must heed warnings and precepts. When evil dharmas intermingle and corrupt, prevention must come first—hence the *Precepts and Regulations*. Having renounced the secular to enter the Dao and received the precepts as a monastic, one relies on the treasure of the master and must cultivate proper demeanor—thus, *Dignified Observances* are next elucidated. The preceding measures prevent evil, but past transgressions remain unexpiated; hence, one must perform purification rituals and repent the evils of three lifetimes. With demeanor refined and past karmic roots purified, one must advance in learning. To realize the truth of principle, one must rely on Daoist arts. The subtleties of Daoist arts are revealed in *Biographical Accounts*, which narrate the sequence of study and practice. As one’s work in learning becomes evident, one’s name is transmitted on bamboo and silk—hence, *Biographical Accounts* follow in order.\n\nFrom the generation of beings to the completion of practice, all is worthy of praise—thus, *Eulogistic Odes* come next. The preceding verbal teachings are mostly in prose and unstructured discourse; here, *Eulogistic Odes* consist of metered verses and structured phrases. With merit fulfilled and virtue perfected, one must express the intentions of the numinous mind, as in the example of reporting merits after purification rituals—hence, *Memorial Petitions* are presented. The preceding Twelve Categories elucidate transcendent practices, while subsequent *Memorial Petitions* dispel worldly calamities, such as the *Three Primordials*, *Mud and Ash*, and *Midnight and Noon Petitions for Longevity*—all pertain to memorials.\n\n**Chapter Six: Detailed Exegesis**\nThis comprises twelve layers of exegesis, the first being the exegesis of the *Original Text*. Previously, the exegesis was based on the *Cavernous Mystery*; if fully expounded, it is called the *Exegesis of Emptiness*. The *Vermilion Script of the Radiant August Emperor* and the *True Text of Sagely Responses* are but a single scripture. According to the Five Thearchs to whom they pertain, they are divided into five chapters. The thearchs and their chapters each have names, as recorded in the *Upper Scroll of the True Text*.\n\nThe August Thearch of the East, Lord of the Azure Spirit of the Flourishing Forest of Treasured Jewels, named *Lingwei Yang*, presides over the *True Text* titled *The Treasured True Cavernous Mystery of the Divine Generation*, also known as *The Eight Divine Strategies of the Eastern Mountain*.\n\nThe August Thearch of the South, Lord of the Vermilion Spirit of the Flourishing Yang of Treasured Jewels, named *Chibiao Nu*, presides over the *True Text* titled *The Heaven-Pervading Treasured Girdle of the Southern Clouds*, also known as *The Divine Incantations of the Nine Heavens* and *The Eight Divine Strategies of the Vermilion Thearch*.\n\nThe August Thearch of the Center, Lord of the Primordial Spirit of the Treasured Jewel of the Jade Mystery, named *Hanzhuniu*, presides over the *True Text* titled *The Nine Heavens’ Numinous Writ of the Treasured Kalpa of the Cavernous Clarity*, also known as *The Divine Strategies of the August Thearch of the Yellow Emperor*.",

      "translated_text": "The August Thearch of the West, Lord of the Radiant Spirit of the Seven Treasures of the Golden Gate, named *Yaobaobao*, presides over the *True Text* titled *The Golden Perfection of Treasured Brilliance of the Cavernous Subtlety*, also known as *The Divine Incantations of the Western Mountain* and *The Eight Divine Strategies of the Dragon-Summoning Writ*.\n\nThe August Thearch of the North, Lord of the Fivefold Numinous Mystery of the Profound Darkness of Solitary Brilliance, named *Xieguangji*, presides over the *True Text* titled *The Primordial Spirit’s Treasured Writ of True Generation*, also known as *The Divine Incantations of the Northern Mountain* and *The Eight Divine Strategies of Heavenly Dominion*.\n\nThe *Jade Chapters of the Five Elders* are all texts of the empty cavern’s natural spontaneity. Their explication flows like a current, for their essential meaning is none other than the celestial writ.\n\nNow, broadly discussing past and present, variant texts number six in kind:\nFirst, at the initial separation of yin and yang, there were the *qi* of the Three Origins, Five Powers, and Eight Convergences, which formed the *flying celestial writ*. Later, these were compiled into the *Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal of Luminous Radiance*. Master Lu’s exegesis of the Three Powers calls them the Three Origins. Once the Three Origins were established, the Five Phases were fully present. Taking the Five Phases as positions and harmonizing the Three and Five is called the Eight Convergences, the origin of all writings. There is also the *Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal of Luminous Radiance*, wherein the *qi* of natural flying mystery coalesces in the void to form script. Each character spans a square *zhang*, originating within the Unheaven to generate and establish all things.\n\nAccording to the *True Traces* of Lady Ziwei, the Three Origins and Eight Convergences are the progenitors of all literary compositions. The *Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal* is their root and origin, the beginning of all writing. Yet Master Lu states that the Eight Convergences are the Three Powers and Five Phases, existing only after the division of the cosmos. The *Red Writ* further declares that the *Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure’s Red Writ* emerged prior to the Primordial Beginning. Thus, the Three Origins cannot refer to the Three Powers, nor the Five Powers to the Five Phases. These must instead be the three *qi* of the Three Treasures Venerable One, along with the Five Powers.\n\nTherefore, the *Chapter on the Generation of the Nine Heavens’ Spirits* states: “Heaven and earth, the myriad things—without the nurturance of the Three Origins and the guidance of the Nine *Qi*, none can be born.” It further says: “The Three *Qi* are the honor of heaven and earth; the Nine *Qi* are the root of the myriad things.” Thus, the Three Origins existed before the opening of heaven and earth and the birth of the Three Powers.\n\nOne school, following Master Song’s method, holds that the Eight Convergences are merely the Three Origins and Five Powers. The Three Origins are: first, the *qi* of the *Hundun Taiwu* of the Primordial Lofty Jade Void; second, the *qi* of the *Chihun Taiwu* of the Supreme Purple Void; third, the *qi* of the *Mingji Xuantong* of the Primordial Supreme Clear Void. The Five Powers derive from three: yin, yang, and harmony. Yin comprises lesser yin and greater yin; yang comprises lesser yang and greater yang. The harmony within harmony constitutes the Five Powers.\n\nThe term *seal* refers to compilation, while *cloud writ* is called *cloud seal*. These—the Three Origins and Eight Convergences, the *Eight Dragons’ Cloud Seal*—are all celestial writ. The Three Origins and Eight Convergences correspond to the example of the five texts and eight characters. The *Cloud Seal of Luminous Radiance* corresponds to the examples of the *Five Talismans* and *Five Victories*. The original text of the Eight Convergences totals 1,109 characters. The *Five Chapters of the True Writ* comprise 668 characters, which are the primordial roots of the Three Powers, generating heaven, establishing earth, transforming humans and spirits, and giving rise to the myriad things. Hence, it is said there are the Dao of heaven, the Dao of earth, the Dao of spirits, and the Dao of humans—this is what is meant.\n\nThe *Jade Exegesis* states that in practicing this method, the Five Chapters are divided by character count, each with four applications:\n1. To summon the Nine Heavens’ Thearchs, verify the registers of divine immortals, and seek transcendence to attain perfection;\n2. To summon the stellar officials of the celestial lodges, rectify the celestial divisions, and secure the state and pacify the people;\n3. To subdue the Six Heavens of Fengdu, wherein the Inner Tone Heaven possesses a *qi* of eight characters;\n4. To command the Water Thearch and summon or restrain dragons and fish.\n\nWithin the various heavens, the Inner Tone Heaven has eight characters, and the thirty-two heavens together comprise 256 characters. These expound the celestial degrees, the great assemblies of sages, the names and titles of perfected immortals, the palaces and bureaus they govern, the terraces and cities of their abodes, the transformations and ascents of immortals, the ranks of their ascent, the kinds of demons, the life and death of humans and ghosts, and the causes and conditions of the turning wheel. The sixty-three characters are the names of the primordial essences of the five directions, methods for ingesting and refining to seek transcendence, refining the spirit to transform the body, and ascending to the void in the white moon. The remaining 122 characters lack phonetic explanations.\n\nSecond, the Eight Convergences are rendered into dragon and phoenix script, called *earthly tone* or *earthly writ*. All below this are writings transmitted by the mysterious sages to transcribe celestial texts.\n\nThird, during the time of the Yellow Thearch, Cang Jie, observing the forms of dragons and phoenixes and gathering bird tracks, created ancient script to replace knotted cords, embodying their shapes.\n\nFourth, during the Zhou dynasty, Scribe Zhou altered ancient script into greater seal script.\n\nFifth, during the Qin dynasty, Li Si transformed greater seal script into lesser seal script.\n\nSixth, after the Qin, Cheng Miao altered lesser seal script into clerical script. Some say clerical script is called *assistant script*, for Cheng Miao created it while imprisoned, emerging to manage convict laborers, hence the name *clerical*.\n\nThese constitute the six.\n\nWithin the second category, there is also the *Cloud Seal of Luminous Radiance*, which, following its forms, became Brahmi script, further divided into sixty-four kinds. Disseminated across the thirty-six heavens, scriptures were transmitted, all explained through clerical characters to interpret celestial writ, each proceeding independently.\n\nThe first transmission of ancient script was by Handan Chun. There were also eight styles:\n1. Greater seal script,\n2. Lesser seal script,\n3. Engraved talisman script,\n4. Worm script,\n5. Seal-impression script,\n6. Signboard script,\n7. *Shu* script,\n8. Clerical script.\n\nDuring Wang Mang’s reign, the Minister of Education Zhen Feng was tasked with standardizing script, and six further categories were established:\n1. Ancient script, the texts from Confucius’ wall;",

      "translated_text": "Second, *odd characters*, those ancient and unusual;\nThird, *seal script*;\nFourth, *assisting script*, which is clerical script;\nFifth, *border seal*, used for seal impressions;\nSixth, *bird seal*, used for writing banners.\n\nWhen Cang Jie first created writing, brushes must already have existed. The *Book of Songs* speaks of \"vermilion tubes,\" which were indeed brushes. Yet it is said that Meng Tian invented the brush—Meng Tian, a general of Qin, whose three generations were renowned, crafted brushes with such precision and skill that he alone claimed this extraordinary fame.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor He of Han, Cai Lun first created paper; before this, only bamboo slips and wooden tablets were used. *Tablets* recorded events in detail, while *slips* were brief, lest the text become too cumbersome. Yet it is known that originally, celestial writ was inscribed on golden tablets. The remaining eight styles and six scripts all derive from the true origin, though external scholars may further elaborate on these.\n\nIt is unknown when this scripture was first transcribed onto paper and made into scrolls. Yet one must consider: if brushes existed from the beginning of the kalpa, and the Supreme Perfected inscribed the text, how could there be no paper, nor the eight styles and six scripts? This is to honor the workings of creation, for the Dao encompasses all methods. Later generations merely followed and applied them, with differences only in sequence.\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of Spirit Talismans (Second Section)**\n\nAll myriad methods rely upon the use of refined *qi*. Thus, the Two Modes and Three Luminaries all operate through refined *qi* within them; once the ten thousand things exist, they too are governed by refined *qi*. Therefore, the Five Phases and Six Substances all possess refined *qi*.\n\nBy spreading the Dao’s refined *qi* onto bamboo and ink, and uniting it with the refined *qi* of things, one repels deceit, aids the true and real, summons and assembles the host of spirits, governs life and death, safeguards the kalpa’s course, and pacifies and stabilizes the Five Directions.\n\nThese talismanic characters originate from the structuring of emptiness. The Supreme Perfected, gazing upward, transcribed celestial patterns, arranging them by direction and distinguishing between diagrams, talismans, and script. *Talismans* universally adopt the forms of clouds, phenomena, and celestial bodies; *script* separately analyzes sounds, phrases, and measured meanings; *diagrams* depict the configurations of numinous transformations.\n\nYet within talismans there is script, interspersed with eight diagrams; within script there are diagrams, employing both form and sound. Thus, the eight styles and six scripts mutually elucidate one another.\n\nThe six scripts are:\n1. *Pictographs*, such as the sun and moon;\n2. *Indicatives*, such as \"above\" and \"below\";\n3. *Phono-semantic compounds*, such as \"river\" and \"stream\";\n4. *Associative compounds*, such as \"martial\" and \"trust\";\n5. *Mutually explanatory characters*, such as \"elder\" and \"aged\";\n6. *Phonetic loans*, such as \"command\" and \"chief.\"\n\nThe eight styles are:\n1. *Celestial script*, the Eight Convergences;\n2. *Divine script*, cloud seal;\n3. *Earthly script*, the forms of dragons and phoenixes;\n4. *Inner script*, that which dragons, turtles, fish, and birds disgorge;\n5. *Outer script*, borne by scales, shells, feathers, and wings;\n6. *Demonic script*, miscellaneous and subtle forms;\n7. *Xia script*, modeled on cloud seal;\n8. *Barbarian script*, resembling insects and worms.\n\nThese six scripts and eight styles sometimes share modern and ancient forms, or ancient forms and talismans, mutually augmenting and diminishing to constitute a single method, unified in function. Thus, their similarities and differences are not fixed.\n\nIn the Three Caverns scriptures, talismans may appear in modern characters, for even in the *Old Text Documents of the Zhou* there are instances where ancient and modern characters coincide.\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of Jade Formulas (Third Section)**\n\nThere are two additional scrolls of scripture. The Supreme Dao Lord, at the Upper Observatory of Vermilion Yang in the Southern Cavern, expounded these numinous texts and jade-character formulas to the scholar Wang Long. However, it is unknown to which dynasty the annotations definitively belong; scholars must investigate this.\n\nThese texts also discuss methods for cultivation, talismanic diagrams of the Five Directions, visualization, and disaster aversion. They precisely elucidate the Eight Convergences, while within the original text’s principles, further clarifications emerge—such as the principles of resonance and communication in the explanation of the *True Writ*, or the subtle meanings of focused intention in *Stabilizing the Will*. Matters contain further matters, as in the jade formulas, which also clarify the transmission of scriptures and the rituals of covenant bestowal.\n\nAll explanations within the formulas are collectively termed *jade formulas*.\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of Numinous Diagrams (Fourth Section)**\n\nThe creation of diagrams and texts arises from form and sound. As for the works of the dark sages, each serves a distinct function. *Diagrams* transmit the manifest; *texts* transmit the unmanifest. The *unmanifest* refers to words and principles without form or trace, as in the examples of *Stabilizing the Will* and *Dwelling in Seclusion*. The *manifest* refers to that which has form and trace, as in the Eight Luminaries and the examples of humans and birds.\n\nTexts and diagrams may also bridge the manifest and unmanifest, as previously discussed in the context of contemplation. Some are buried within the Five Peaks to safeguard the kalpa’s course; others are disseminated across the Ten Directions to universally transform and enlighten. Some are concealed in golden caskets to demonstrate the solemnity of celestial patterns; others are hidden in famous mountains, to be revealed only upon proper assembly.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Interpreting Precepts and Disciplines**\n\n**Sixth: On Precepts and Disciplines**\nPrecepts (*jie fa*) are the cessation of evil. \"Cessation\" means restraining the mind and speech from wrongdoing, vowing never to commit evil. The meaning of precepts may be detailed or concise.\n\nDetailed precepts include: the *Taiqing*’s foundational Dao with its boundless dharma gates of one hundred twenty-nine articles; the *Lord Lao*’s and *Three Primes’ Precepts* of one hundred eighty articles; the *Great Precepts on Contemplating the Body* of three hundred articles; and the *Taiyi*’s sixty precepts.\n\nConcise precepts include: the Daoist’s Three Precepts, the *Recorded Lives*’ Five Precepts, the Libationer’s Eight Precepts, the *Xianger*’s Nine Precepts, the *Wisdom’s Upper Grade*’s Ten Precepts, and the *Mingzhen Regulations*’ Twenty-Four Precepts.\n\nDisciplines (*lü*) emerge from precepts without separate categories, primarily addressing the statutes of karmic retribution, as seen in the Celestial Master Lord Lao’s *Xuandu Disciplines* and the *Nüqing Disciplines*.\n\nThus, precepts govern causes, while disciplines govern effects; precepts prevent evil, while disciplines address transgressions. Whether descending from the void or transmitted orally, all adapt to the recipient’s capacity, with variations in conferral.\n\nFor instance, in the *Upper Grade Precepts*, the disciple faces east; in the *Fixed Resolve Precepts*, the disciple faces south; in the *Golden Register Simplified Texts*, the Heavenly Worthy faces north.\n\nFacing east aligns with the sun’s position. According to the *Three Primes’ Precepts*, the eastern and southern directions are left-official realms, belonging to *Taiyang*; the western and northern directions are right-official realms, belonging to *Taiyin*. First, one repents sins and seeks deliverance, thus facing *Taiyin* (north) and bowing to the ten directions. Next, one requests life and seeks meaning, thus facing *Taiyang* (east) to receive the precepts.\n\nIn the *Fixed Resolve* teachings, the dharma master resides in the south while the disciple faces the master, bowing with their head turned toward them. Logically, the dharma master often faces north, as in the *Golden Register*. In the *Upper Grade Precepts*, the disciple faces east; in the *Fixed Resolve Precepts*, the disciple faces south—both direct the disciple toward the *qi* of life.\n\nOne may ask: In the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* and the *Twenty-Four Lives Diagram*, the dharma master faces south or north, differing from these examples. What is the reason?\n\nThe answer: In those scriptures, the Heavenly Worthy personally commanded the Three Heavenly Perfected Ones to transmit the *Twenty-Four Lives Diagram* to the Dao Lord, and ordered the Nine Heavens’ Marshal and Jade Attendant Immortal to transmit the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit* to the Flying Heaven Spirit King. At that time, the Flying Heaven Spirit King and the Dao Lord faced north to petition the Heavenly Worthy. The messengers, bearing the Heavenly Worthy’s command, came from his side to confer the texts. These were transmissions of scriptures, distinct from the conferral of precepts, and thus cannot serve as precedents.\n\n**Seventh: On Interpreting Ritual Demeanor**\nThe Three Primes originally possessed three thousand four hundred standards of ritual demeanor—postures and movements. After the Dragon Han era, many texts became incomplete. Today, only two hundred forty remain, as later generations were deemed unworthy, and the rest were not transmitted.\n\n**On the Merits of Fasts and Offerings**\nFormer Song masters listed six categories; our school now clarifies two: *Ultimate Dao* and *Deliverance*.\n\n*Ultimate Dao*: As the *Scripture of Cavernous Spirit* states, \"Fasting the mind and sitting in forgetfulness—this is the Ultimate Dao.\"\n\n*Deliverance*: According to the scriptures, there are three registers and seven grades.\n\nThe *Three Registers* are:\n1. *Golden Register Fast*: Dispels celestial calamities and safeguards the emperor.\n2. *Jade Register Fast*: Delivers the people, beseeching blessings and repenting transgressions.\n3. *Yellow Register Fast*: Liberates those suffering in the earth prisons and the Nine Dark realms.\n\nThe *Seven Grades* are:\n1. *Three Sovereigns Fast*: Seeks immortality and protects the state.\n2. *Natural Fast*: Cultivates truth and harmonizes with the Dao.\n3. *Upper Clarity Fast*: Ascends to the void and enters the subtle.\n4. *Instruction Fast*: Averts disasters and heals illnesses.\n5. *Mud and Ashes Fast*: Repents transgressions and pleads for life.\n6. *Illuminating Truth Fast*: Rescues souls from the dark night.\n7. *Three Primes Fast*: Repents sins before the Three Officials.\n\nThese fasts may last one day and night, three days and nights, or seven days and nights, each with its own ritual procedures.\n\nAdditionally, there are the Six Fasts, Ten Upright Days, Jiazi, Gengshen, Eight Nodal Days, Life-Destiny Days, Hundred-Day, Thousand-Day Fasts, and others, all employing natural methods.\n\nThe *Six Fast Months* are the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh lunar months. The *Three Long Fast Months* are the first, seventh, and tenth lunar months.\n\nThe *Ten Upright Days* are the first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of the lunar month.\n\nThe *Eight Nodal Days* are the *Beginning of Spring*, *Spring Equinox*, *Beginning of Summer*, *Summer Solstice*, *Beginning of Autumn*, *Autumn Equinox*, *Beginning of Winter*, and *Winter Solstice*.\n\nFurther distinctions among these fast days will not be elaborated here.\n\n**Eighth: On Interpreting Methods**",

      "translated_text": "The former teachings broadly outline nine methods: first, coarse food; second, vegetable food; third, moderated food; fourth, consuming essences; fifth, consuming sprouts; sixth, consuming light; seventh, consuming qi; eighth, primordial qi; and ninth, embryonic nourishment.\n\nCoarse food refers to hemp and wheat; vegetable food refers to greens and eggplants; moderated food refers to balanced meals; consuming essences refers to talismanic water and cinnabar elixirs; consuming sprouts refers to the cloud-sprouts of the five directions; consuming light refers to the sun, moon, Seven Origins, and Three Luminaries; consuming qi refers to the qi of the six senses and the wondrous qi of heaven, earth, and the four directions; consuming primordial qi refers to all that is endowed with the qi of the Three Origins, the essence of Great Harmony, abiding in the Great Void; embryonic nourishment refers to the harmony of one’s own original essence, the origin of the embryonic sac, where pure emptiness descends as qi through the four limbs, no longer dependent on external sources.\n\nCoarse food curbs all indulgent cravings; vegetable food moderates rich and fatty foods; moderated food eliminates vexation and turbidity; consuming essences refines the body and spirit into radiant splendor; consuming sprouts transforms one into sprouts; consuming light transforms one into light; consuming the six qi transforms one into the six qi, roaming the ten directions; consuming primordial qi transforms one into primordial qi, merging with heaven and earth as one body; consuming embryonic qi reverts one to an infant, blending with the Dao as one.\n\nThrough these transformations, the workings of destiny are altered, and one no longer awaits the abandonment of the body to receive a new form or undergo the cycles of life and death. The present interpretation of methods need not be limited to matters of diet; they may also involve medicinal formulas, massage, and other practices.\n\n**Ninth: On Interpreting the Myriad Techniques**\n\nAll techniques are interconnected. Broadly speaking, there are five practices: first, contemplating the spirit and preserving the true; second, fasting the mind and sitting in forgetfulness; third, pacing the void and soaring through space; fourth, ingesting and absorbing primordial qi; and fifth, guiding and drawing in the Three Luminaries. These all involve the mind and qi working in concert, enabling the spirit and Dao to communicate in hidden harmony.\n\nRegarding their transformations, there are three kinds: first, ascending to heaven in broad daylight; second, liberation through the corpse; and third, extinction where the form remains unharmed.\n\nAscending to heaven in broad daylight occurs when merit is perfected and the Dao is complete, when the thirty-six thousand spirits, the Three Ones, and the Imperial One merge into one body, and the body attains wondrous unity. Thus, one can ascend to heaven with the spirits in the same form. Alternatively, by reciting the *Great Cavern Scripture* and the *Human-Bird Mountain*, one may be welcomed by cloud chariots without the need for ingestion, for the body has already transformed and ascends to the Vermilion Numinosity to receive refinement.\n\nLiberation through the corpse follows the principles of rank and karma. Extinction, as in the case of the Great One guarding the corpse, may last for years, after which the corpse revives as a person.\n\n**Tenth: On Records and Biographies**\n\nRecords trace the events of the past, while biographies may also foretell future events. The bodies of all sages and spirits arise from two sources: first, natural attainment, and second, cultivation.\n\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* speaks of progressing from death to life, from life to the Dao, from the Dao to immortality, from immortality to perfection, and from perfection to becoming the Supreme Clarity Yellow Elder Lord, such as the Thirty-Nine Perfected, the Twenty-Four Emperors, the One Hundred Eighty Dao Lords, and the Heavenly Worthies. Some of these exalted beings arise from natural wondrous qi and spontaneous transformation, while others achieve this through cultivation. The natural and the cultivated merge as one.\n\nThough the ranks of these sages and perfected beings number in the myriad grades, the general meaning is as described in the principles of rank and karma. The *Seven Perfected and Arrayed Records*, the biographies of the Dao Lords, and other genealogical records fall into this category.\n\n**Eleventh: On Hymns and Eulogies**\n\nFour-character verses correspond to the four seasons and four qi; five-character verses align with the five phases and five virtues; seven-character verses correspond to the Seven Origins and Seven Luminaries. These include original hymns and eulogies, such as those in the *Nine Heavens’ Generation of the Spirit*, which employ the flying and mysterious qi of the Three Caverns as their foundation.\n\nIn later scriptures, there may be hymns and eulogies composed by Dao Lords, Perfected Ones, and various heavenly beings. These are all works of the mysterious sages, included within the scriptures.\n\nThough the jade characters of celestial texts originally derive from Sanskrit sounds, when teaching and expounding scriptures, they are understood according to their categories. For instance, the writing of true texts originates from the Sanskrit of the Three Origins and Eight Assemblies of Brahma Heaven. Today, using clerical script and translating these sounds into written form preserves both seal and clerical scripts, making the translation manifest while the Sanskrit remains hidden. In the *Nine Heavens’ Generation of the Spirit Chapter*, the original text is not transmitted, nor are the Sanskrit sounds revealed; only the clerical script and its sounds remain.\n\nAs for the *Inner Sounds and Jade Characters*, there are similarities and differences. The similarity lies in transmitting seal script through clerical script; the difference is that the sounds are not translated from Sanskrit, rendering the text’s singularity or complexity incomprehensible. Yet when the Heavenly Perfected and August Ones expound upon it, they still employ the great Sanskrit sounds to articulate these matters, aligning this world’s phenomena with the affairs of the Mystic Capital. Thus, it is known that the sounds of the true sages can universally apply to all things.\n\n**Twelfth: On Memorials and Petitions**\n\nThis section pertains primarily to the Orthodox Unity tradition. Though all myriad affairs differ in their manifestations, the sages established methods to regulate them through specific practices.\n\nThe Dao resides in the human heart, yet memorials and petitions are necessary because, when direct mystical union is unattainable, one relies on affairs to make it manifest. When affairs are made manifest, the heart becomes clear, and thus the outward forms are fully expressed.\n\nThe human heart has no substance, yet when set in motion, it encounters circumstances. When circumstances are purified, the heart becomes clear; when the heart is clear, conduct becomes pure. Pure conduct enables communion with the divine, and a clear heart enables union with the Dao of heaven. Thus, ascending the altar to make vows, relying on memorials and petitions, reveals both heart and form, fully uniting the human and the divine.\n\nThe *Regulations on Chapter Pledges* states: offering goods demonstrates sincerity; sincerity in the Dao involves relinquishing wealth to dispel calamities and disperse misfortune. There are many names for this, but its essentials are three: first, bestowing upon common people, extending even to birds, beasts, creeping insects, and flying creatures, all equally receiving alms; second, making offerings to the three ranks, adorning and honoring the Three Treasures, and providing for sages and worthies, collectively called *supply and support*.",

      "translated_text": "**Clarifying the Teachings (First)**\n\nTo clarify the teachings is to elucidate the meaning of the thirty-six divisions. Within the Three Vehicles, each vehicle possesses its own first twelve divisions, thus combining to form thirty-six. Regarding their mutual inclusion: the Great Vehicle encompasses all thirty-six divisions, the Middle Vehicle comprises twenty-four, and the Lesser Vehicle only twelve. Why is this so? Because the Great may subsume the Small. Moreover, the Great Vehicle may be studied comprehensively, while the Small cannot encompass the Great, being limited to twelve; the Middle Vehicle may be inferred accordingly. This broadly addresses the intent of the *Inner Transformation Gate for Men*.\n\nIn discussing the Three Caverns, it is to unite the preceding Three Vehicles into this One Vehicle—thus, the Three Caverns ultimately belong to the One Great Vehicle. Yet, when the Three Caverns are further divided into three, it is to demonstrate that within the One Vehicle, nothing is left unencompassed. Hence, what follows clarifies that three also reveals one, three is not three, and three-one is neither one nor three—this is the orthodox meaning.\n\n**Question:** In unifying the three into one, do the Three Vehicles remain?\n**Answer:** They are fundamentally neither present nor absent. If absent, what is there to unify? If present, why speak of unification?\n\n---\n\n**Cultivating Conduct (Second)**\n\nThere are two scriptures that differ in their exposition:\n\n**First,** *The Natural Rites of the Supreme Mystery Capital and Laozi* states that the Mystery Scripture comprises three sections:\n1. The *Scripture of Heaven*, cultivated by celestial perfected beings;\n2. The *Scripture of Earth*, practiced in the grotto-heavens;\n3. The *Scripture of Man*, followed in the world.\n\nThe methods of these three realms interpenetrate, and each category is called the Three Vehicles. The application of the Three Vehicles each consists of twelve principles, which interweave and interconnect, collectively termed the thirty-six divisions. The twelve principles are:\n1. Non-action;\n2. Action;\n3. Non-action yet action;\n4. Action yet non-action;\n5. Continuing attachment;\n6. Severing attachment;\n7. Neither severing nor continuing;\n8. Segmented existence;\n9. Non-segmented existence;\n10. Discerning the subtle;\n11. Discerning the manifest;\n12. Universal application.\n\nIn terms of the realm, these are also called the twelve divisions. When both the hidden and manifest are employed, there are seventy-two divisions. Here, the preceding three scriptures are referred to as teachings in themselves, while the latter twelve principles pertain to conduct.\n\n**Second,** the *Orthodox Unity* expounds twelve principles as follows:\n1. Both mind and traces in non-action;\n2. Mind in non-action, traces in action;\n3. Mind in action, traces in non-action;\n4. Abandoning the household to dwell among people;\n5. Bringing the household into rivers and marshes;\n6. Leaving the world, isolated from others;\n7. Harmonizing with the world, blending with the dust;\n8. Severing desires to sever them utterly;\n9. Not severing;\n10. Roaming the void;\n11. Dwelling beneath the earth;\n12. Abiding in the heavens.\n\nEach of the Three Vehicles possesses twelve, thus forming thirty-six. The general explication of this text has already been addressed in the *Meaning of Ranks and Practices*.\n\nThe disparity in the names and flavors of these two scriptures lies in their distinct approaches to teaching. The *Supreme Mystery* primarily grounds its exposition in the mind, while the *Orthodox Unity* comprehensively discusses both mind and traces. In the *Supreme Mystery*’s twelve principles, the eighth—*segmented existence*—pertains to matters involving traces and is thus manifest.\n\n*The Great Meaning of the Cavern Mystery and Numinous Treasure’s Gate of Mystery concludes here.* (Note: Before *Boundless*, there appears to be missing text.
