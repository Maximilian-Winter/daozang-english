  "full_translation": "**The Transmission of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue**\n\n*Title:* The Transmission of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue. Transmitted by Lu Xisheng of the Tang. Four fascicles.\n\n*Source of the Base Text:* \"Washing the Spirit\" Section, Jade Category, *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*.\n*Collated Edition:* Wuqiu Beizhai’s photolithographic reprint of the *Zhihai* edition, published by Qian Xizuo during the Daoguang reign of the Qing (hereafter referred to as the *Zhihai* edition). This work does not divide chapters by name.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Transmission of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue***\n\nThe Preface states:\n\nWhen the Great Dao lay hidden and worldly teachings declined, the realm descended into chaos. At such times, Heaven inevitably gives rise to sages. These sages, grieving that the people had not attained order, devised methods to uphold the declining and rescue the chaotic.\n\nBy the late Zhou, such a moment had nearly arrived. Thus, Confucius expounded the culture of the Five Dynasties to uphold its decline, while Laozi grounded himself in the simplicity of the Three Sovereigns to remedy its chaos—their aims were one.\n\nConfucius’s teachings flourished through culture, using culture to govern the emotions. Laozi’s teachings originated in simplicity, employing simplicity to restore nature. The ultimate of nature and emotion cannot differ for sages; yet the transformations of culture and simplicity cannot be uniform across the ages.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Manifesting through benevolence.\" This refers to teaching through culture. Such teaching is evident in its affairs, thus open and clear. Being open and clear, refined speech becomes detailed.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Concealing through application.\" This refers to teaching through simplicity. Such teaching is subtle in its principles, thus profound and unrecognizable. Being profound and unrecognizable, those who fabricate falsely multiply.\n\nOnly Laozi’s teachings take the Dao as their essence and names as their function, practicing non-action yet accomplishing all, aligning with the imperial standard. Yang Zhu adhered to Laozi’s essence but fell short, valuing the self and belittling things. Zhuang Zhou expounded Laozi’s function but overreached, striving to abolish sages and discard wisdom. Shen [Buhai] and Han [Fei] misapplied Laozi’s names, leading to harshness and rigidity. Wang [Bi] and He [Yan] lost Laozi’s Dao, drifting into emptiness and recklessness. These six masters were all transgressors against Laozi.\n\nYet the world claims that Laozi’s intent does not align with Confucius. Thus, they slander his name, accusing him of striking down benevolence and righteousness, abolishing ritual and learning. They criticize his Dao, saying it relies solely on purity and emptiness—how could this govern? Alas, the world’s delusion has persisted for long. This has caused Laozi to suffer slander for a thousand years, his Dao unfulfilled in his own era, and there is good reason for it.\n\nMoreover, Laozi traced the origins of Heaven and Earth, recounted the changes of past and present, first clarifying Dao and virtue, then expounding benevolence and righteousness, and finally exposing the failures of ritual and music, the excesses of punishments and governance. His words describe how things naturally come to be. Holding to the essential and grasping the root, he focused on the ultimate of nature and emotion. Thus, his Dao begins with body and mind, takes form in family and state, and extends to the world—so comprehensive is it. Yet some still speak recklessly—is this not a grave slander?\n\nOf old, Fuxi drew the Eight Trigrams, symbolizing the myriad things, exhausting the principles of nature and destiny, and harmonizing with the Dao and virtue. Laozi, too, preceded Heaven and Earth, rooted in yin and yang, deduced the ultimate of nature and destiny, and explored the mysteries of Dao and virtue—this aligns with Fuxi in origin.\n\nKing Wen observed the movements of the nine and six in the *Great Change*, valuing firmness and esteeming transformation, yet centering on the mean. Laozi also examined the correctness of the seven and eight in the *Great Change*, attaining softness and maintaining stillness, yet unifying them in the great—this shares a lineage with King Wen.\n\nConfucius followed the examples of Yao and Shun, modeled himself on Wen and Wu, and guided the people with the teaching of benevolence and righteousness. Laozi likewise emulated Fuxi, encompassed the Yellow Emperor, and covered the world with the transformation of Dao and virtue—this aligns in principle with the Master.\n\nThese three noble ones were the pinnacle of sages. Laozi transformed and connected with them, returning to unite with them, investigating the mechanism of ultimate change and exploring the subtleties of utmost refinement—this may be called the most divine.\n\nYet Wang Bi claimed that sages unite with the Dao in substance, while Laozi could not embody the Dao. Thus, Ruan Ji called him a \"superior worthy, a near-sage,\" aligning with [Wang] Fusi. Could it be that Laozi’s traces in governing the world were insufficient to fulfill his words? This is not so.\n\nAlas, when sages are in the world, some leave traces, some do not. Thus, when the Dao is not practiced, some humble themselves and journey through the realm, taking the world’s troubles as their own; others conceal their names and flee, showing that worldly affairs cannot entangle them. Whether leaving traces or not, different paths lead to the same end—this is truly the gateway of Dao and righteousness, not merely opposition.\n\nThus, Confucius’s emergence and Laozi’s seclusion, Laozi’s silence and Confucius’s speech—these are the extremes of yielding and extending, concealing and revealing. How could those two masters comprehend this?\n\nSima Qian, in compiling the histories of the various schools, placed Dao and virtue first—this may be called understanding root and branch. Ban Gu, in composing the *Table of Ancient and Modern Personages*, demoted Laozi to the third rank. Though his name may be mocked, can his Dao truly be denigrated?\n\nAlas, Laozi’s teachings have long been discarded in his own era—this is the doing of those few masters. Moreover, Confucius personally met Laozi and sighed, saying his Dao was \"like a dragon.\" He followed him to inquire about ritual without finding fault—this is recorded in the annals. Later generations could not fathom his intent, giving rise to heterodox theories. Those who transmitted his teachings did not exhaust their source, so those who opposed them did not grasp their subtleties.\n\nAlas, if this transmission had not been made, Laozi’s intent might have nearly vanished. Now, I have thoroughly explored its subtleties and revealed its profundities, making it clearly harmonize with the intentions of the multitude of sages. Those who can embody his Dao, employ his names, grasp the ancient to steer the present—achieving order will be as easy as turning one’s palm.\n\nAmong those who have spoken of Laozi’s teachings, only the Grand Historian [Sima Qian] came close.\n\nThe governance that slightly grasped its Dao was only that of Emperor Wen of Han. All other perverse words and deceptive theories are not worth adopting.\n\n*Preface to the Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue by Lu Xisheng of Wu Commandery*\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue*\n**Author:** Lu Xisheng of the Tang dynasty\n**Format:** Four scrolls\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, Jade Category\n**Collated Edition:** Wuqiu Beizhai reprint of the *Zhihai* edition published by Qian Xizuo during the Daoguang reign of the Qing (referred to as the *Zhihai* edition)\n*Note:* This work does not mark chapter divisions.\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on the Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue, Scroll One**\n*Transmitted by Lu Xisheng of Wu Commandery*\n\n**Classic:**\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the constant name.\nThe nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth;\nThe named is the mother of the myriad things.\nThus, always without desire, observe its mystery;\nAlways with desire, observe its manifestations.\nThese two emerge together but differ in name.\nTogether they are called the profound. Profound and again profound—\nThe gate of all mysteries.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe Dao is the essence; the name is its function. Function arises from essence, yet essence is originally without function. Names are established by the Dao, yet the Dao is originally without name.\nEssence is originally without function, so no function is impossible—hence it is said, \"can be spoken.\" What can be spoken refers to essence fulfilling function. Essence fulfilling function is the principle of things, not the constancy of the Dao—hence it is said, \"not the constant Dao.\"\nThe Dao is originally without name, so no name is impossible—hence it is said, \"can be named.\" What can be named refers to seeking essence through name. Seeking essence through name is the transformation of things, not the constancy of names—hence it is said, \"not the constant name.\"\nThe so-called constant Dao and constant name are not the Dao that \"can be spoken\" or the name that \"can be named.\" Why? The constant Dao and constant name cannot be spoken and cannot be named; only by understanding the discourse on essence and function can one profoundly penetrate their ultimate depths.\nThus, one who embodies the Dao is the Sovereign, who follows the principles of things. One who employs names is the Emperor, who adapts to the transformations of things. Following principles and adapting to transformations, descending to ascend—such a one is the King.\nTherefore, those who attain it supremely become spirits; those who attain it moderately become sages; those who attain it minimally become wise; those who attain it partially become worthies; and those who do not attain it become the common people.\nThe so-called nameless is the essence of the Dao, prior to movement and stillness. The named is the function of the Dao, the origin of good and evil.\nEssence is the root of names, thus it transcends movement and stillness—tracing it back, it is the beginning of heaven and earth. Names arise from function, thus they generate good and evil—pushing it to the limit, it is the mother of the myriad things.\nThus, the Sovereign upholds the nameless, while the Emperor practices the named. Upholding the nameless, one acts without acting and yet nothing is left undone. Practicing the named, one acts yet does not rely on action.\nThe Sovereign follows the principles of things, responding to their lack of desire by maintaining clarity and stillness—hence it is said, \"always without desire, observe its mystery.\" Mystery refers to stillness illuminating principle, the subtly profound and profoundly penetrating.\nThe Emperor adapts to the transformations of things, responding to their desires by acting with restraint and pattern—hence it is said, \"always with desire, observe its manifestations.\" Manifestations refer to movement illuminating affairs, where divergent paths converge as one.\nThe so-called \"these two\" refer to the beginning and the mother, that is, the arts of the nameless and the named—emerging from the same essence yet differing in function.\nThe profound is that which illuminates both affairs and principle. One who knows the subtly profound and profoundly penetrating art of the nameless, and the art of the named where divergent paths converge as one—using stillness to control transformation, movement to return to the root, so that movement and stillness are not distinct—then affairs and principle profoundly converge.\nWhen affairs and principle profoundly converge, things cannot burden one. Thus, one retreats and hides in secrecy, sharing fortune and misfortune with the people, yet the drumming of the world does not share the sage’s concerns—this is the utmost profundity of the spirit.\nEmerging, one becomes the multitude; entering, one becomes the mystery. There is nothing that does not proceed from this Dao.\n\n**Classic:**\nWhen all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.\nThus, being and non-being produce each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short shape each other,\nHigh and low incline toward each other,\nSound and voice harmonize with each other,\nFront and back follow each other.\nTherefore, the sage abides in the affairs of non-action and practices the teaching without words.\nThe myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them,\nHe gives them life yet does not possess them,\nHe acts yet does not rely on them,\nHis work is accomplished yet he does not dwell in it.\nIt is precisely because he does not dwell that it does not depart.\n\n**Commentary:**\nWhat people call beauty and ugliness all arise from emotion. Adapting to emotion is beauty; opposing emotion is ugliness. The same applies to utmost goodness and not-goodness.\nYet what is deemed beautiful is not necessarily beautiful; what is deemed ugly is not necessarily ugly. What is deemed good is not necessarily good; what is deemed not-good is not necessarily not-good. Why is this? Emotion causes it.\nHuman nature is largely the same, but emotions differ. When divergent emotions are externally stirred by things, likes and dislikes become entangled, and beauty and ugliness lack a foundation—how can they be rectified? It lies in returning to nature.\nFormerly, what emotions give rise to must originate from nature. Thus, the sage transforms emotion to return to nature, reaching great unity.\nThe so-called \"being and non-being producing each other\" refers to emotion and nature. The mutual dependence of emotion and nature is like difficulty and ease completing each other.\nIn governance, if emotion disorders nature, it is difficult to succeed; if nature rectifies emotion, it is easy to succeed.\nThe so-called \"long and short shaping each other\" refers to beauty and ugliness. The mutual contention of beauty and ugliness is like high and low inclining toward each other.\nThe so-called \"sound and voice harmonizing with each other\" refers to goodness and not-goodness. The mutual reliance of goodness and not-goodness is like front and back following each other.\nAlas, the world’s many troubles arise from these six. This is why all under heaven is not well-governed, and the myriad things cannot fulfill their natures.\nThe sage, wishing to restore their natures, first transforms their emotions.\n\nThe Way of the Good is to nurture goodness within oneself, yet the ungood I also nurture and make good. Thus, the good is cultivated.\n\nThe Way of the Faithful is to trust within oneself, yet the unfaithful I also make trustworthy. Thus, faith is cultivated.\n\nTherefore, governance does not discard any thing, and teaching does not discard any person. When things are governed, there is no evil; when people are taught, there is none ungood—yet the world still remains ungoverned.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nIts Dao is most vast, and nothing is left to waste.\nThis is what is spoken of.\n\nThus, the sage embodies the formless Dao and acts without doing, yet affairs are naturally settled.\nThey employ the named Dao and speak not, yet teaching proceeds of itself.\nSo they allow all things to fulfill their natures, as if no one compelled them—\nlike the heavens and earth producing myriad things yet not claiming their use,\nlike the myriad artisans crafting tools yet not relying on their completion,\nlike the four seasons fulfilling their yearly tasks yet not dwelling on their results.\n\nOnly thus can their Dao be constant, and their name never fade.\n\nThe Canon states:\nDo not exalt the worthy, lest the people contend;\nDo not prize hard-to-obtain goods, lest the people become thieves;\nDo not display what is desirable, lest the heart be disordered.\nThus, the sage’s governance empties the mind, fills the belly, weakens the will, and strengthens the bones—\never making the people ignorant of knowledge and free from desire,\nso that even those who know do not dare act.\nWhen there is no doing, nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nThe Transmission says:\nIf one cherishes what is exalted, then things yield to their desires.\nYielding breeds falsehood, falsehood breeds deceit.\nThus, exalting the worthy stirs the competitive heart,\nand prizing goods invites thievery.\n\nOnly by correcting emotion with nature does one\nnot see the desire for exaltation,\nand follow the Dao without deceit or falsehood.\n\nTherefore, the sage governs the people by\ndispersing surplus wealth, thus emptying the greedy, thieving heart.\nManuring barren fields, thus filling the hungry people’s stomachs.\nNot exalting the skilled, thus weakening their ambitions,\nand not burdening them with military service, thus strengthening their bones.\n\nEver making the people of all under heaven\nignorant of knowledge yet knowing it,\nfree from desire yet desiring it—\nthough some may know what is exalted,\nthey dare not act upon it,\nfor the armies will not dare to do so.\n\nThe sage who acts without doing,\nwho uses the named yet embodies the formless,\nthus brings all under heaven to governance.\n\nThe Canon states:\nThe Dao is boundless yet employed—\nsometimes it does not overflow.\nDeep as the source of all things.\n\nIt blunts the sharp, resolves the tangled,\nharmonizes the bright, aligns with the dust,\nsettles as if it might exist.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nit precedes the Emperor.\n\nThe Transmission says:\nThe Dao’s essence is its true substance,\nits boundlessness is its function.\nAll under heaven turns to it, yet it never overflows;\nit is the source of all things, its depths unfathomable.\n\nTo grasp its function is to blunt the harshness of worldly desires,\nto resolve the entanglements of worldly affairs.\nTo embody its essence is to harmonize the luminous without brilliance,\nto align with the dust without obscurity.\nThough settled beyond measure, it endures like existence—\nthus first it is likened to \"as if,\" and later to \"as if it exists.\"\n\nI cannot finally know its origin—\nit is like the One before heaven and earth were born.\n\nThe Canon states:\nHeaven is long, Earth is enduring.\nHeaven and Earth endure long because they do not generate themselves—\nthus they can long endure.\n\nTherefore, the sage follows his own body yet his body precedes,\nsets it aside yet his body remains.\nIs it not because of their lack of self-interest?\nThus they achieve their own ends.\n\nThe Transmission says:\nHeaven and Earth produce myriad things yet do not generate themselves—\nthus they endure without decay,\nlast forever without ceasing.\nThe people rely on the sage for governance,\nyet the sage does not depend on the people.\n\nIt is like the ritual sacrifice (*chúdǎo*) relying on divine illumination to complete,\nyet the divine illumination has no use for the sacrifice.\nOnly when there is no use is there no partiality,\nand when there is no partiality, no favoritism.\nThus, Heaven and Earth, though without favor, generate great favor,\nand the sage, though not \"仁\" (*rén*), achieves great \"仁.\"\nTherefore, the people do not refuse virtue from the sage,\nand myriad things do not withhold life from Heaven and Earth.\n\nHow do I know this to be true?\nI observe between Heaven and Earth—\nit is like the bellows (*tuóqiào*) without heart.\nThe bellows, without heart, thus its sound does not tire,\nits breath ever emerges.\nHeaven and Earth, without heart, thus they generate and complete without ceasing,\nand governance does not require much speaking.\nMuch speaking without reverence leads to exhaustion—\nit is better to attend to affairs of non-action,\nto practice teaching that requires no words.\n\nThis is the substance of embracing the Dao,\nthe essence of preserving life—\nthe art of guarding the center.\n\nThe Canon states:\nThe spirit of the valley does not die—\nthis is called the mysterious mother.\nThe mysterious mother’s gate—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nEnduring as if it exists, yet its use is not exhausted.\n\nThe Transmission says:\nThe \"valley\" symbolizes the Dao’s essence,\nthe \"spirit\" signifies the Dao’s function.\nTrue essence, wondrous function—\nresponding to things without end.\nThus it is said: the spirit of the valley does not die.\n\nOnly when the spirit of the valley does not die\ncan one exhaust the essence and function of Heaven and Earth.\nThe \"mysterious\" is Heaven’s essence,\nthe \"mother\" is Earth’s function.\nTo embody the mysterious and employ the mother—\nthis is the sage’s art,\nthus it is called the mysterious mother.\n\nThe mysterious mother’s art\nis the opening and closing of yin and yang,\nthe unmeasurable transformations.\nOpening and closing are the Dao of yin and yang,\nand yin and yang are the foundation of Heaven and Earth—\nthus the mysterious mother’s gate is called the root of Heaven and Earth,\nenduring as if it has no end.\n\nIts essence does not perish,\nits function does not labor—\nthis is called: the king follows Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nthe Dao follows Nature.\n\nThe Sage nourishes the people yet does not nourish himself,\nthus his teaching endures long, resembling Heaven and Earth.\nTherefore, he does not dare to lead the world first—\nthen he delights in promoting others without tiring;\nhe does not dare to possess himself—\nthen he sacrifices his body without peril.\nTruly, only because he does not selfishly hold onto himself\ncan he then possess the world.\n\n**Scripture:** The highest excellence is like water.\nWater excels in benefiting all things without striving,\ndwelling where people despise—\nthus it approaches the Dao.\nIts dwelling is good as Earth,\nits mind is deep as a well,\nits giving is kind as virtue,\nits speech is trustworthy as truth,\nits governance is orderly as skill,\nits actions are capable as ability,\nits movements are timely as nature.\nOnly because it does not contend\nis it without blame.\n\n**Commentary:** Those who follow the Dao have no failing,\nthus they are called the highest excellence.\nWater always rests in filth below,\ndoes not contend with things,\nso all things gain their benefit—\ntruly, it is close to the Dao.\nThus, the highest excellence is like this water’s virtue:\nits dwelling in the world is like water on the earth,\nits mind is like water’s depth and return,\nits giving is like water’s nourishment,\nits speech is like water’s truthfulness,\nits governance is like water’s clarity and stillness,\nits actions are like water’s adaptability,\nits changes are like water’s response to time.\nOnly because it always rests in filth below,\nno one can harm it;\nonly because it does not contend with things,\nno thing contends with it.\nThe *Classic of Changes* says: \"The humble hold the key to virtue.\"\nWater embodies this.\n\n**Scripture:** To grasp and fill is not as good as stopping in time;\nto sharpen by measuring is not long preserved.\nGold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them;\nwealth and honor bring arrogance, and one invites disaster.\nWhen the work is done and the name is complete,\nwithdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven.\n\n**Commentary:** To hold a great vessel and fill it to the brim,\nthough feared, is not as good as stopping early;\nto occupy a high position and exceed limits,\nthough worried, is not as good as retiring early.\nTo grasp power and sharpen ambition,\nthough obtained, cannot be long preserved;\nto hoard gold and jade in the hall,\nthough possessed, cannot be long guarded.\nNoble yet arrogant invites ruin;\nrich yet arrogant increases fault.\nArrogance arises from the heart,\ndisaster stems from oneself—\nhow can one blame Heaven or people?\nThus, those with the Dao,\nwhen their work is done, do not claim it;\nwhen their name is complete, they do not retain it;\nthey withdraw their body to preserve their return,\nyield their position to avoid danger.\nLike the cycles of the four seasons,\ncold and heat alternate, and all things flourish—\nis this not the Dao of Heaven?\n\n**Scripture:** To carry the spirit and embrace Oneness—\ncan one avoid separation?\nTo concentrate the vital breath and govern softness—\ncan one be like an infant?\nTo purify and gaze into the mysterious—\ncan one be without flaw?\nTo love the people and govern the state—\ncan one act without action?\nTo open and close the Heavenly Gate—\ncan one be receptive as the female?\nTo be clear and all-pervading—\ncan one be without knowledge?\nTo give birth and nurture—\nto give birth yet not possess,\nto act yet not rely,\nto grow yet not dominate—\nthis is called the mysterious virtue.\n\n**Commentary:** *Load* means \"husband,\" the beginning of speech.\nThe *spirit* is the start of life.\nThe *One* is the child of the Dao.\nTo nurture the beginning, to embrace the child—\nthen spirit and form do not separate.\nTo focus on the harmonious and gentle,\nto achieve a tranquil mind—\nthen nature and vital breath are like an infant.\nTo cleanse the heart and abandon perception—\nwhat thought, what worry—\nthen the Dao and virtue are without blemish.\nTo love the people as one’s own children,\nto govern the state as a small fresh fish—\neach corrects themselves,\nthen one can act without action.\nTo follow Heaven and respond to change,\nopening and closing in turn—\nthings transform of themselves,\nthen one can guard the receptive.\nThe Dao is not obscured,\nvirtue spreads broadly—\nthe people follow with their ears and eyes,\nthe Sage treats them as children,\nthen one can be without knowledge.\nThe first three are for cultivating oneself,\nthe latter three for governing the state.\nTo cultivate for oneself, its virtue is true;\nto cultivate for the world, its virtue is universal.\nThus, only in this way\ncan one give birth and complete all things,\nnurture and feed the people.\nOnly if one can give birth without possession,\nact without arrogance,\nnurture without domination—\nthen the Dao’s use extends deeply to things,\nthus it is called the mysterious virtue.\n\n**Scripture:** Thirty spokes meet at one hub,\nyet it is the emptiness that gives the cart its use;\nclay is shaped into vessels,\nyet it is the emptiness that gives them their use;\ndoors and windows are carved for a room,\nyet it is the emptiness that gives it its use.\nThus, what is has its advantage,\nbut what is not has its use.\n\n**Commentary:** What is above form is called the Dao,\nwhat is below form is called the instrument.\nThe Dao uses *not-being* for its function,\nthe instrument uses *being* for its advantage.\nYet what is has its advantage only because of what is not,\nwhat is not has its use only because of what is.\nThus, the cart has spokes and hub to symbolize Heaven,\nthe room has doors and windows to symbolize Earth—\nthe cart and room’s full advantage\nalways lies in their emptiness,\nis this not like the space between Heaven and Earth?\nAs for shaping clay into vessels,\ntheir utility depends on fire and water—\nonly then can their use be spoken of,\njust as the Sage, in completing instruments and lengthening life,\nmust first establish virtue and the Dao,\nonly then can teaching and transformation be practiced.\nThus, vessels of clay,\nsymbolizing humanity between Heaven and Earth,\nillustrate the boundary between the Dao and instruments.\n\n**Scripture:** The five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deafen the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the palate,\ngalloping and hunting madden the mind,\nrare treasures disrupt conduct.\nTherefore, the Sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes,\nthus he discards the latter for the former.\n\n**Commentary:** The eyes do not see formless rites—this is blindness,\nthe ears do not hear soundless music—this is deafness,\nthe mouth does not taste the Dao’s flavor—this is dullness.\nThese three afflictions arise from the bewitchment of the five colors, five tones, and five flavors.\nBewildered by externals, one is confused within—\nthus the Sage fears them.\n\nThe Sage does not fall ill because he fears illness itself.\nAlas! Among desires, none is more rampant than hunting in wilds—\nwhen indulged, the heart grows mad as if stricken by disease.\nAmong possessions, none is more burdensome than a hall filled with treasures—\nto hoard them brings obstruction to conduct.\nTo remove this obstruction, one must not accumulate excess;\nto cure this madness, one must only conquer the mind and become Sage#1.\nThus, acting for the belly brings contentment,\nwhile acting for the eyes breeds craving.\nHence, discard the great bewitchment;\nembrace this mysterious virtue.\n\n**Scripture:**\nHonor and disgrace strike like sudden alarm—\ntreating great calamity as one’s own body.\nWhat is meant by \"honor and disgrace strike like alarm\"?\nHonor is lowly—gaining it causes alarm,\nlosing it causes alarm—\nthis is called \"honor and disgrace strike like alarm.\"\nWhat is meant by \"treating great calamity as one’s own body\"?\nMy great calamity arises from having a body.\nWhen I have no body, what calamity do I have?\nThus, to hold the body as the world’s treasure is as if one could entrust the world to it;\nto love the body as the world is as if one could deposit the world in it.\n\n**Commentary:**\nHonor and disgrace are the constant emotions of flourishing and withering.\nTo be alarmed is the ordinary mind toward gain and loss.\nWhen virtue and Dao fill the inner self,\nexternal things cannot sway one—\nthus, when honor and disgrace arrive, the heart never stirs.\nThis is the highest of scholars.\nIf the inner self is not at peace,\nand one is moved by external things,\nemotions cling to honor and disgrace,\ngain and loss both strike like alarm—\nthis is the lesser path.\nSince the heart’s movements differ only in degree from alarm,\nit is called \"as if\" alarmed.\nElevation must have lowliness as its foundation,\ndisgrace must have honor as its root—\nthus, disgrace and honor are like echoes following sound.\nFortune harbors misfortune within,\nhonor leans on disgrace.\nWhen sound is struck, the echo responds;\nwhen honor arrives, disgrace follows.\nCommon sentiment pursues superficiality,\nthus alarmed by disgrace but not by honor,\nwhile the Dao-heart observes the root—\nalarmed by honor and more so by disgrace.\nThus it is said, \"Honor is lowly,\"\nmeaning honor is the root of disgrace,\nthe reason it can strike like alarm.\nInitially, \"honor and disgrace strike like alarm\" seems balanced,\nbut later, only honor is called lowly,\nwhile gain and loss strike like alarm—\nthis clarifies that alarm at honor is the root.\n\nMoreover, great calamity refers to matters of fortune and misfortune.\nHaving a body is the source of great calamity.\nThus, clinging to one’s body brings great calamity—\nso to value the body is to value great calamity.\nAlas! To value great calamity is already extreme confusion.\nSpeaking of common sentiment’s deeper delusion,\nit has not yet reached valuing the body—\nthus it says, \"value calamity as one’s body,\"\nmocking the extreme of valuing the body.\n\nWhat the world calls fortune is wealth, honor, celebration, and reward—\nyet one constantly fears losing them.\nWhat the world calls misfortune is poverty, lowliness, punishment, and penalty—\nyet one constantly fears gaining them.\nTo fear gaining and fear losing brings anxiety—\nthus, the world’s anxieties are none greater than fortune and misfortune.\nThe Sage takes the people’s heart as his own,\nso he also takes fortune and misfortune as his anxieties.\nYet the root of anxiety lies in the body—\nwho in the world has no self?\nThe body does not merge with things,\nand groups divide, clustering in kinds,\nlove and hate attacking each other—\nonce fortune and misfortune arise, anxiety follows.\nThe Perfect Man embodies the Dao without self,\nharmonizing with all things, blending with dust,\ngrowing without domination—\nthough he shares breath with the people,\nhe does not share the Sage’s anxieties.\nBut if one’s heart is moved by gain and loss,\nand distinctions of self and other linger in the mind,\nthen honor and disgrace never bring lasting peace,\nfortune and misfortune never cease—\nhow can one be the world’s standard,\nor dwell in the center’s greatness?\n\nOnly those who value using their body for the world,\nand love using their body for the world,\nare truly valuing and loving the world,\nnot their bodies.\nThus, gain and loss lie beyond themselves,\nand anxiety is not their burden.\nThis is as if the great position could be entrusted to them—\nyet they dare not rule it themselves,\nmuch less claim ownership.\nThis is the Way’s practice,\nthe intention of making the world public.\n\n**Scripture:**\nTo gaze and not see is called *yí* (夷),\nto listen and not hear is called *xī* (希),\nto grasp and not hold is called *wēi* (微).\nThese three cannot be questioned or examined,\nso they merge into one.\nIts upper reaches are not bright,\nits lower depths are not dark—\nendless and nameless, returning to nothingness,\nthis is called the form of formlessness,\nthe image of no-image—\nthis is called *hǔnhǔn* (惚怳).\nApproach it and you see no head,\nfollow it and you see no tail.\nHolding the ancient Way,\nto govern the present.\nTo know the ancient beginning\nis called the Dao’s foundation.\n\n**Commentary:**\nWhat is visible when gazed upon is color.\nWhat is heard when listened to is sound.\nWhat is grasped when seized is form.\nAll things under Heaven possess these,\nyet the Dao lies between Heaven and all things,\nneither color, sound, nor form—\nthus it cannot be obtained by ear, eye, hand, or foot.\nYet though formless, it shapes all forms,\ncolors all colors, sounds all sounds—\nhence it is forcibly named *xī-yí-wēi*.\nBut since it cannot be questioned or examined,\nthese three merge into one.\nAbove, the sun and moon shine together, yet its light is not bright;\nbelow, it rests with tiles and rubble in stillness, yet its clarity is not dark.\nEndlessly flowing without interruption,\nit cannot be named—\nthough it undergoes myriad transformations, it returns to nothingness.\nYet the Dao’s essence is true and refined,\noriginally not nothingness—\nit is simply not obtainable by sight, hearing, or touch.\nThus it is called the form of no-form,\nthe image of no-image.\nSpeaking of its form, it suddenly seems nonexistent;\nspeaking of its image, it faintly seems present.\nNo one knows its beginning,\nso approaching it reveals no head;\nno one knows its end,\nso following it reveals no tail.\n\nOnly those who grasp the Dao of ancient *wuwei*—\nwho wield the names of present *youwei*—\ncan thus return to primordial simplicity,\nrecovering the purity of the earliest antiquity.\n\nTo know the pristine simplicity of antiquity’s beginning\nis the very framework of the Great Dao,\nthe essential foundation of teaching and transformation.\n\n**Scripture says:**\nThe ancient adept was subtle, profound, and unfathomable,\nso deep that none could truly perceive him.\n\nSince he could not be perceived,\nhe feigned outward forms:\nCautious as one crossing a winter river,\napprehensive as if fearing watchful neighbors,\nsolemn as a guest,\ndissolving like ice about to thaw,\nsolid yet unadorned—\nplain as uncarved wood,\nvast as an empty valley,\nmuddy yet undisturbed.\n\nWho could still the turbid and let clarity emerge?\nWho could remain still and yet let life stir?\n\nThose who uphold this Dao do not seek fullness.\nBecause they do not seek fullness,\nthey endure without renewal—\ntheir essence never fades.\n\n**Transmission says:**\nThe virtue’s workings are subtle and profound,\nthe Dao’s essence unfathomable.\nSince its depths are hidden and hard to know,\nit is given outward symbols:\nIn advancing, cautious as one crossing a boundless river;\nin halting, wary as if neighbors were aware;\nin solemnity, dignified as host and guest in audience.\n\nIn its expansion, vast as spring ice about to dissolve.\n\nIts substance is solid yet plain as uncarved wood,\nits vessel is spacious as mountains with valleys,\nits heart is muddy yet undisturbed.\n\nThese are the outward forms of the virtuous scholar’s Dao and virtue—\nyet common folk cannot recognize them.\n\nWho could follow the world’s turbidity and still it to clarity,\nletting its flow emerge pure?\nWho could embrace the world’s ease and stir it to action,\nletting its teachings arise?\n\nOnly those who deeply grasp the subtle interplay of ebb and flow,\nof fullness and emptiness,\ncan uphold this Dao and align with Heaven’s course.\n\nFor only when virtue is not full does the Dao not falter—\nfollowing its light to govern with clarity,\nembracing its stillness to observe life’s stir—\nthen can one act through decay and achieve governance,\nwithout needing novelty to transform.\n\n**Scripture says:**\nTo perfect emptiness and steadfastly guard stillness—\nwhen all things arise together, I observe their return.\n\nAll things teeming, each returns to its root.\nReturning to root is called stillness,\nstillness is called restoring the Mandate,\nrestoring the Mandate is called constancy,\nknowing constancy is called wisdom.\nTo not know constancy is reckless action—disaster.\nTo know constancy is to bear with it,\nto bear with it is to be impartial,\nimpartiality is called kingship,\nkingship is called Heaven,\nHeaven is called the Dao,\nthe Dao is called enduring,\ndying without beginning.\n\n**Transmission says:**\nTo govern with profound emptiness and subtle perfection—\nthis is the use of virtue.\nTo guard stillness with focused sincerity—\nthis is the essence of the Dao.\n\nIts use knows no bounds, so all things arise together;\nits essence is serene, thus it observes their return.\n\nThunder in the earth—this is Heaven and Earth’s return;\nmovement within stillness—this is the Sage’s return.\nReturn reveals Heaven and Earth’s heart.\nHeaven and Earth take the Sage’s heart as their own.\n\nThus all things, teeming, return to their root;\nall affairs, scattered, return to principle.\nPrinciple is the source of affairs,\nstillness is the sovereign of movement,\nnature is the root of emotion.\n\nMan is born in stillness—Heaven’s nature;\nwhen moved by things, it is human emotion.\nWhen emotion returns to nature,\nwhen movement returns to stillness,\nthen Heaven’s principle is fulfilled.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nTo exhaust principle and perfect nature until reaching Mandate.\nThus to exhaust Heaven’s principle is to perfect human nature;\nto perfect human nature is to know Heaven’s Mandate.\n\nHence it is said:\nReturning to root is called stillness,\nstillness is called restoring the Mandate.\nFrom the perspective of Heaven’s Mandate,\nthe nature of all things becomes visible.\n\nThus it is said:\nHeaven’s Mandate is called nature,\nthe utmost of nature and Mandate is called profound mystery.\nYet nature and Mandate’s principle arise from this mystery,\nso to follow one’s nature is to enter the profound.\n\nThe profound can illuminate principle,\nilluminating principle is called the Dao—\nto cultivate the Dao is to return to nature.\nTo interact with things is called teaching,\nthus it is said:\nFollowing nature is called the Dao,\ncultivating the Dao is called teaching.\n\nThus the teaching that can be passed on lies in perfecting it,\nthe Dao that can endure lies in nature’s fulfillment.\nThe profound’s essence is deep and unrecognizable—\nthe benevolent are hindered by their perceptions,\nthe common folk use it without knowing,\nso those who embody the Dao are rare indeed.\n\nHence it is said:\nTo inherit is perfection,\nto perfect is nature.\nThe benevolent see it as benevolence,\nthe wise see it as wisdom,\nthe common folk use it daily without knowing—\nthus the Sage’s Way is scarce.\n\nManifest in benevolence, hidden in use,\nstirring all things yet not sharing the Sage’s concerns—\ngreat virtue and achievement indeed!\n\nThis is Confucius’ ultimate discourse on the depths of Dao and virtue,\nthe mystery of nature and Mandate.\n\nThe Dao endures because it skillfully responds to all things,\nyet all things cannot burden it.\nOnly those who know the Dao’s constancy\ncan constantly benefit all things without being burdened.\n\nIts use is subtle, its principle clear—\nthus to know its constancy is called inheriting clarity.\n\nTo not know how to benefit all things,\nyet to recklessly impose laws and teachings—\nthen the people of the world will suffer harm.\n\nOnly those who know the constant Dao and clearly benefit all things,\nlike Heaven and Earth’s nurturing cover,\nwithout partiality toward any,\nwill have the people follow and revere them,\nthus aligning with the Dao’s constancy\nand enduring without regret throughout life.\n\n**Scripture says:**\nThe most exalted—\nthe next rank knows of their existence;\nthe next, they are cherished and praised;\n\nThe next rank fears them and reviles them.\nTrust is insufficient, so there is distrust.\nYet they still prize their words.\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs completed,\nthe people say of them, *\"It was as if by nature.\"*\n\n**Tradition says:**\nIn the age of ancient virtue, the sovereigns\ndid nothing and made no advances,\nso the common folk knew only of their rulers’ existence,\nsaying, *\"What power does the Emperor have over me?\"*\n\nWhen virtue declined, seven principles were instituted for governance.\nThe world was covered by their benevolence, so they were cherished;\nthey were held in their righteousness, so they were praised.\n\nWhen benevolence and righteousness were insufficient to govern the heart,\nthey ruled through penal codes and laws, so the people feared them.\nWhen penal codes and laws were insufficient to restrain their intentions,\nthey resorted to stratagems and deceit, so the common folk reviled them.\n\nAh! When the heart is sincere, it is called *xìn* (trustworthiness);\nwhen words can be relied upon, it is called *xìn* (faithfulness).\nIf sincerity is not genuine and words cannot be trusted,\nyet they still prize empty boasts—\ncan this be called *chéngxìn* (sincerity and trustworthiness)?\n\nWhen Dao and virtue are obscured,\nbenevolence and righteousness become prominent.\nWhen benevolence and righteousness fail to take root,\npenal codes and laws are enforced—\nyet they still exalt superficial techniques—\ncan this be called *dàodé* (Dao and virtue)?\n\nThe Sage acts differently:\nholding fast to the ancient while governing the present,\ncutting away ornament to return to simplicity,\naccomplishing deeds without clinging,\ncompleting affairs without action,\nhaving law yet no law,\nadapting to the times for their work.\n\nThus the people naturally fulfill their true nature,\nall saying, *\"It is as if by nature, naturally so,\"*\nso the hearts of cherishing, praising, fearing, and reviling\nnever arise in the world.\n\n**Scripture says:**\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned,\nthere is benevolence and righteousness.\n\nWisdom arises, yet great deceit follows;\nsix kinds of kin grow discordant, yet filial piety and kindness emerge.\nWhen states fall into chaos, loyal ministers appear.\n\n**Commentary says:**\nThe Master Lao’s teachings hold fast to the ancient while governing the present,\nthus discerning the inevitable principles—\nthese are actions taken when there is no other choice.\nLater generations failed to grasp his intent,\nand so claimed his teachings conflicted with Confucius—\nthis is the case here and in the following chapter.\nAlas, the Master Lao has been maligned for so long—\nnow I clarify and illuminate his words.\n\nDoes not the *Records* say:\nWhen the Great Dao prevails,\npeople do not merely love their own kin,\nnor merely cherish their own children.\nThey abhor wealth discarded upon the earth,\nyet do not hoard it for themselves;\nthey abhor strength unused in service,\nyet do not claim it for themselves alone.\nThus, deceitful plots do not arise,\nbandits and rebels do not act,\nouter doors remain unbarred—\nthis is called *Dàtóng* (Great Harmony).\nAt such times,\npeople draw water from wells,\ntill fields for food,\nrise with the sun and rest with the setting—\nwhat power does the Sage exert over them?\nThe common folk merely recognize its existence—\nhow could benevolence and righteousness intervene?\n\nWhen the Great Dao is obscured,\npeople love only their own kin,\ncherish only their own children,\nhoard wealth and strength for themselves,\nand employ benevolence and righteousness to govern—\nto rectify the relations of ruler and subject,\nto strengthen father and son,\nto harmonize brothers,\nto unite husband and wife.\nThe people cherish and praise them,\nand thus benevolence and righteousness become prominent.\nFrom this perspective,\nwhen simplicity scatters into tools,\nis it not the case that when the Great Dao is abandoned,\nbenevolence and righteousness arise?\nHence, Confucius sighed at the *Zhuō Bīn* banquet,\nwhile the Master Lao expounded in *Dàodé Jīng*—\ntheir intent was one and the same.\n\nThe Sage’s wisdom encompasses all things yet does not adorn conduct,\nhis enlightenment benefits the world yet does not flaunt righteousness.\nAt such times, people do not yet recognize wisdom as wisdom.\nAs the age declines and contention spreads,\nmen use wisdom to conceal deceit,\nuse enlightenment to undermine righteousness—\nthen the arts of wisdom become apparent,\nwhile the traces of deceit are concealed.\nIs it not so that wisdom arises, yet great deceit follows?\n\nThus, the *Two Observances* condemned Zhòng Zhèng Mào,\nand the *Spring and Autumn Annals* recorded the treachery of Chu Zǐ Qián—\nthen how different were Confucius’ intentions from those of the Master Lao?\n\nAs for the Way of father and son,\nit is innate human nature.\nFollowing nature’s harmony,\nparents and children naturally grow close—\nwho would know filial piety and kindness?\nYet when external influences seduce,\nnature transforms into emotion,\nand when questioned, some stray from their innate nature.\nThe Sage cultivates the Dao as teaching to harmonize the world,\nso that parents and children mutually love one another,\nand the names of filial piety and kindness become prominent—\nthus it is said: *When six kinds of kin are discordant, filial piety and kindness emerge.*\nHence, even though the blind historian was dull-witted,\nShun was called a great filial son;\nthough Zēng Zhè was stern,\nZǐ Sān was praised for his filial care—\nthis is the inevitable principle.\nHow could the Master Lao oppose it?\n\nWhen a flying dragon soars in the sky,\nvirtuous men occupy high positions,\nand ministers support the ruler without obstruction—\nthen loyal ministers do not appear.\nBut when the ruler above is benighted\nand the people below are in chaos,\nonly then do ministers risk their lives for the state,\nutter words that grieve the heart and offend the ear—\nthus it is said: *When states fall into chaos, loyal ministers appear.*\nHence, when Jiè of Xia was enthroned,\nLóng Féng’s loyalty shone forth;\nwhen Jǐn of Shang perished,\nBǐ Gān’s defiance emerged—\nthese are actions taken when there is no other choice—\nhow could the Master Lao oppose them?\n\nIf scholars grasp his intent,\nthen the methods of Confucius and Lao are not in conflict.\n\n**Scripture says:**\nAbandon the Sage, discard wisdom—\nthe people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness—\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nAbandon cleverness, discard profit—\nthieves and robbers vanish.\nThese three are insufficient as doctrine,\nso they are assigned their proper place.\nEmbrace simplicity, hold fast to purity,\nreduce private desires and few wants.\n\n**Commentary says:**\nThe Sage’s wisdom benefits creatures,\nyet some suffer harm from its use—\nthus blame is wrongly placed upon the Sage’s wisdom,\nand some say to abandon and discard it,\nso that the people’s benefit may increase a hundredfold.\nBenevolence and righteousness harmonize the people,\nyet some incur resentment from their use—\nthus blame is wrongly placed upon benevolence and righteousness,\nand some say to abandon and discard them,\nso that the six kinds of kin may be harmonized.\nCleverness and profit aid people,\nyet some turn to theft from their use—\nthus blame is wrongly placed upon cleverness and profit,\nand some say to abandon and discard them,\nso that robberies and assaults may cease.\n\nHarm and benefit arise together,\nlike form and shadow inseparable—\nnatural principles cannot be extinguished.\nSome, blinded by the decay of the age,\nfail to perceive how decay begets renewal—\nthey say to abandon and discard,\nso as to return to ancient beginnings—\nthis is like hating shadows yet unaware that light requires darkness,\nand thus seeking to erase form itself.\n\nThe Master Lao lamented that people had long strayed from the Dao,\nand refuted these erroneous arguments,\nclaiming that doctrine alone is insufficient to govern—\nthus he especially emphasized these three,\nclarifying that this was not his intent.\n\nI differ.\nThe Sage’s wisdom is the master of crafted tools.\nBenevolence and righteousness are the virtues of social relations.\nCleverness and profit are the skills of artisans.\nIf their use becomes corrupt,\nI must adjust and rectify them—\nthis is the principle: *Decay begets renewal*,\nthe constant way to rescue what is flawed.\n\nThus, the method of rectification is to assign them their proper place—\nto still the turbid with quiet patience,\nto move the settled with gentle action.\nBy guiding transformation gradually,\npeople naturally embrace simplicity and purity,\nreduce private desires and few wants.\n\nAlas, those who embrace simplicity and purity\nbecome honest and approach benevolence;\nthose who reduce private desires and few wants\nbecome sincere and love righteousness.\nFrom this point backward, the progression is clear—\nhow could the Master Lao’s teachings conflict with Confucius’?\n\nMoreover, this chapter concludes with *reduce private desires and few wants*—\nhow then could *abandon benevolence and discard righteousness* be his intent?\n\n**Scripture says:**\nAbandon learning, have no worries.\n\nThe **\"Yes\" and the \"Ah\"**—how far apart are they?\nThe **good and the evil**—how distant are they?\n\nWhat people fear, one must not fail to fear.\nOh, the vastness! It knows no end.\n\nThe multitude bustles joyfully,\nas if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\nas if ascending the Spring Terrace.\nYet I alone stand trembling, still unmanifest—\nlike an infant before its first smile.\n\nDull and listless, as if lacking,\nas if homeless with nowhere to return.\nThe multitude all have abundance,\nwhile I alone seem forsaken.\n\nAh, my foolish heart—\npure and unadorned.\nThe vulgar shine brightly,\nwhile I alone seem dim;\nthe vulgar scrutinize keenly,\nwhile I alone remain obscured.\n\nSerene as the boundless sea,\nswift as the wind with no rest.\nThe multitude all act with purpose,\nwhile I alone seem stubborn and crude.\n\nI alone differ from others,\nand cherish the **Mother**.\n\n**Commentary says:**\nThis chapter’s profound meaning aligns with the last.\nThe **Sage’s** learning is for the **Dao**—\nwhen the **Dao** prevails, the world is ordered.\nThe vulgar’s learning is for gain—\nwhen gain prevails, the world descends into chaos.\n\nSome detest the vulgar’s learning for its chaos,\nand thus claim abandoning it brings no worry—\nyet this leads the superficial to never grasp the **Dao**.\n\nThe Master Lao outlines its essence,\ndiscussing its gains and losses.\nHe says: In human responses, a single word suffices.\nSpeak **\"Yes\"** and people call it **reverence**,\nspeak **\"Ah\"** and people call it **arrogance**.\nYet to use arrogance as reverence,\nwithout adding more words,\nyet failing to use **\"Ah\"** as **\"Yes\"**\nmakes for a rude exchange.\n\nSimilarly, the world’s learners all study for learning’s sake—\nstudying the **Dao**, the world calls it **good**,\nstudying for gain, the world calls it **evil**.\nTo take gain as the **Dao**,\nwhen reflected upon, may seem right,\nyet failing to turn **evil** into **good**\nleads only to the world’s chaos.\n\n**\"Yes\" and \"Ah\"**—when compared, how slight their difference—\nyet **good and evil**—how vast their separation!\n\nNow, at the most simple truth,\none can achieve the most difficult deeds,\nyet cannot reverse and act upon it—\nthis is why the Master Lao sighs in lament.\n\nThus, he lays bare the world’s failings,\nto correct what the **Dao** attains.\n\nThe terror of laws and punishments—\nwhat the world commonly fears.\nEven the virtuous cannot fail to fear them.\nWhy?\nFor as the teachings decay,\ncalamities arise,\nexcessive punishments prevail,\nand threaten even the good—\noh, the ruin! It knows no end—how fearful!\n\nThe joy of rank and reward—\nwhat the world delights in.\nTo fulfill desire,\nit is like arraying the finest vessels for the grandest feast;\nto achieve ambition,\nit is like ascending the terrace to behold the spring blossoms.\n\nEven the virtuous cannot refuse them—\nyet when obtained, they take it calmly, without joy,\nlike an infant before its first smile.\nIn their possession, they are dull and listless,\nas if lacking, as if a homeless man with nowhere to return.\n\nThe vulgar prize intelligence and strength,\nalways seeming to have excess.\nThe virtuous, however, embrace simplicity and weakness,\nalways seeming to lack.\n\nIs it not like the dull and ignorant,\nwhose hearts know nothing?\nNo—it is their nature, pure and unadorned,\nwithout striving for cleverness.\n\nThe vulgar, shining brightly, take clarity as virtue,\nwhile the virtuous, dimly obscured, take obscurity as **virtue**.\nThe vulgar, keenly discerning, take exposing deceit as skill,\nwhile the virtuous, quietly steadfast, take knowing the constant as the **Dao**.\n\nThus, in stillness, they are vast as the unfathomable sea,\nin motion, swift as the wind with no end.\nThe multitude act with purpose—\nI alone seem idle, crude, and base.\n\nThus, while all chase after trifles,\nloving to nourish their **child**—\nI alone return to the root,\nand cherish the **Mother**.\n\nThe **Mother** is the **Dao**.\nThe **child** is the **One**.\nTo love and nourish the **child** is to indulge desires with the vital essence;\nto cherish the **Mother** is to return to purity and stillness in the **Dao**.\n\n**End of Volume One of the *Dao De Jing* Transmission**\n**Chapter One: \"Strive in Thought to Become Sage\"**\n(*Original text had \"兄\" [elder brother],

indistinct.\nVague and indistinct it is,\nYet within it there are forms;\nIndistinct and elusive it is,\nYet within it there are things.\nDeep and dark it is,\nYet within it there is **qi**—\nIts **qi** is most true,\nWithin it lies **faith**.\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nIts name does not vanish,\nTo observe and encompass all **spontaneity**.\nHow do I know that all **spontaneity** is thus?\nBy this.\n\n**Transmission:**\nThe **virtue** of emptiness and space\nEncompasses all things—\nIt follows only the **Dao** of true **qi**.\nYet the **Dao** as a thing—\nVague as if it exists,\nElusive as if it does not,\nCannot be fixedly spoken of.\nHow so?\nFor it is **stillness** and **void** without form,\nUnable to be grasped as existing yet manifesting myriad forms,\nOr as **thousand transformations and ten thousand changes**,\nUltimately returning to **nothingness**.\nThough vague and elusive, existing and non-existing are indeterminate,\nDeep and dark, yin and yang are unfathomable,\nYet the **faith** of true **qi** abides between them.\n\nWhen **pure** and **unadulterated**, it is called **qi**;\nWhen **spontaneous**, it is called **true**;\nWhen **utter sincerity**, it is called **faith**.\nThus, **utter sincerity** is its function,\n**Pure qi** is its **body**;\nWhen **body** and function merge mysteriously,\nIt is called **spontaneous**—\nThe **Dao** follows **spontaneity**.\n\nHow do I know that **spontaneity** is true?\nFor its name, from ancient times to the present,\nEndures as the **Dao**—\nIts name never departs.\nBecause its name never departs,\nIt can observe and encompass all **spontaneity**.\n\n**Spontaneity** refers to those who observe and encompass all things’ **spontaneity**.\nHow do I know that all things’ names can be observed?\nFor all things’ names are not fixed names,\nThus their names change with the world and perish.\nOnly the **Dao**’s enduring name does not vanish,\nThus it can observe names that can be named.\n\nOnly those who know the **Dao**’s name\nCan govern and respond to affairs.\nThough myriad things arise daily before us,\nI alone remain **non-doing** yet govern.\n\n**Scripture:**\nThe crooked becomes whole,\nThe bent becomes straight,\nThe hollow becomes full,\nThe worn becomes new,\nThe few gain,\nThe many are confused.\nThus the Sage embraces **One** as the model for all under heaven.\nNot self-assertive, hence **illuminated**;\nNot self-righteous, hence **manifest**;\nNot self-praising, hence **accomplished**;\nNot self-glorifying, hence **enduring**.\nOnly because he does not contend,\nAll under heaven cannot contend with him.\n\nThe ancients’ saying *\"The crooked becomes whole\"*—\nWas it mere idle talk?\nThus I sincerely affirm it as whole and return to it.\n\n**Transmission:**\nWhen the crooked is fulfilled without omission, affairs are whole;\nWhen one bends himself to extend things, principles become straight.\nWhen desires are few, affairs return to their root—\nThus the hollow becomes full;\nWhen the turbid is still, principles become clear—\nThus the worn becomes new;\nWhen affairs return to principles,\nThus the few gain;\nWhen principles conflict with affairs,\nThus the many are confused.\n\nThe Sage knows the **Dao**’s **laws**,\nEmbraces the **Dao**’s **One**,\nTo harmonize affairs with principles,\nTo harmonize principles with affairs—\nWhen affairs and principles merge in **mystery**,\nThus he can serve as the **Dao**’s pattern for all under heaven.\n\nNot self-assertive yet **illuminating** others,\nNot self-righteous yet **manifesting** truth;\nNot self-praising his talents,\nThus affairs return to reality—\nHence governance achieves **accomplishment**;\nNot self-glorifying his abilities,\nThus principles attain their due—\nHence the **Dao** endures.\n\nOnly by following the **Dao**’s principles,\nNot contending with things,\nAll under heaven’s affairs follow him.\n\nThus he can fulfill all things’ crookedness without omitting the minute and hidden,\nThis is the ancients’ saying *\"The crooked becomes whole\"*—\nWas it mere idle talk?\nIf he can truly fulfill the crookedness,\nThen all under heaven will be whole and return to him.\n\n**Scripture:**\nDesiring few words, **spontaneity** is achieved.\nA gusting wind does not last through the morning,\nA sudden rain does not last through the day.\nWho does this?\nThe heavens and earth.\nHeaven and earth still cannot endure,\nHow much more so for man?\nThus those who practice the **Dao**—\nThe **Dao**-practitioner aligns with the **Dao**,\nThe **virtue**-practitioner aligns with **virtue**,\nThe **loss**-practitioner aligns with **loss**.\nThe **Dao**-practitioner,\nThe **Dao** also attains;\nThe **virtue**-practitioner,\n**Virtue** also attains;\nThe **loss**-practitioner,\n**Loss** also attains.\nThus, **faith** insufficient,\nThere is **unfaith**.\n\n**Transmission:**\nThe Master Lao was about to implement the **teaching of non-speaking**,\nTo align with **spontaneity**’s principles,\nThus he marked and named it.\nThe **Scripture** says:\n*\"Listening yet not hearing\"* is called **few words**.\nThus, **few words** is akin to **non-speaking**.\n\nZhongni said:\n*\"How does the heavens speak?\nThe four seasons proceed in its course,\nThe myriad things are born from it.\"*\nAgain it says:\n*\"The heavens does not speak yet is **faith**-ful.\"*\nThis is the **Dao**’s **spontaneity**.\n\nThe **spontaneity**’s principles\nAre the **Dao**’s constant.\nLike the four seasons’ course,\nThe heavens and earth’s constant,\nThus they endure unceasingly,\nEnding yet beginning anew.\n\nThe gusting wind and sudden rain\nAre not the heavens and earth’s constant,\nThus their arising is abrupt,\nTheir cessation is fleeting.\n\nThough the heavens and earth are vast,\nThey still cannot endure this unnaturalness,\nHow much more so for humanity,\nCan it endure unnaturalness for long?\n\n**Virtue** and **Dao** hidden,\n**Ren** and **yi** not practiced,\n**Ritual propriety** and **punishments** become burdensome—\nThey are done only out of necessity.\nYet the confused cannot know **ritual propriety**,\nTaking **punishments** as the greatest **punishment**,\nAspiring to the **Dao**’s **non-action**,\nYet desiring to grasp one side,\nSaying it can be practiced for **hundred generations**—\nThis is an error.\n\nAh! The gusting wind and sudden rain\nHave their time to cease,\nThe four seasons’ course never ends,\n**Spontaneity**’s principles\nCannot be altered.\n\nThus those who practice the **Dao**\nAre **Dao**-embodiments.\nFollowing **spontaneity**,\nThey do not lose the **Dao**’s constant,\nThus the **Dao** also attains them—\nThey align with the **Dao**.\n\nThose who practice **virtue**\nAre **virtue**-users.\nThough they lose the **Dao**’s constant,\nThey do not lose **virtue**’s constant—\nThus **virtue** also attains them—\nThey align with **virtue**.\n\nThose who practice **loss**\nHave already lost in **virtue** and **Dao**,\nAnd also lost in **Ren** and **yi**,\nThus **loss** also attains them—\nThey align with **loss**.\n\nThe *Records* say:\n*\"Doing good differently, yet all return to **governance**;\nDoing evil differently, yet all return to **chaos**.\"*\n\nAh, this is nearly true.\n\nAlas, how unreliable is trust when it falters!\nThus, when one is forced to act against their will,\nYet still acts—how deeply confused they are!\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"Those who stand on tiptoe cannot stand firm,\nThose who stride cannot walk steadily.\nThose who see only themselves are blind,\nThose who insist on being right are never clear,\nThose who boast of their own deeds achieve nothing,\nThose who pride themselves in their abilities do not endure.\nAs for the Dao,\nIt is like surplus food or burdensome baggage—\nThings others despise, so those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\"*\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"Those who cling to profit cannot stand firm in the constant Dao,\nThose who straddle desire cannot walk steadily in the constant name.\nIf the roots of desire and profit are not forgotten,\nYet one claims, ‘I can bring governance,’\nThere is no way to do so.\"*\n\nThus, when one obscures others by self-regard, affairs become unclear;\nWhen one contradicts others by self-righteousness, principles are not revealed;\nWhen one boasts of one’s talents, governance yields no fruit;\nWhen one vaunts one’s abilities, the Dao does not endure.\nThese four afflictions share the same malady as tiptoeing and striding—\nNone are sufficient to achieve governance.\n\nIf we speak of the Dao,\nTo discard surplus food is not enough to satisfy hunger,\nTo bear burdensome baggage is exceedingly ugly—\nEven ordinary things are despised, so how can those who follow the Dao dwell upon them?\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"There exists a formless substance,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\nSilent and boundless,\nIt stands alone yet never changes,\nCirculates endlessly yet never falters—\nIt can be the mother of all under Heaven.\nI do not know its name,\nSo I call it the Dao.\nForced to name it, I call it Great.\nGreat means passing,\nPassing means distant,\nDistant means returning.\"*\n\nThus, the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nThe Sage-King is great.\nTherefore, within the realm, there are four greats,\nAnd the Sage-King occupies one of them.\n\nHumans model Earth,\nEarth models Heaven,\nHeaven models the Dao,\nThe Dao models spontaneity.\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*The *Yijing* says: \"The Great Polarity (*Taiji*) is the origin of the Two Principles (*liangyi*).\"\nThus, we know that the formless substance\nWas born before Heaven and Earth.\nSilent and without trace,\nIt stands independent beyond all transformations,\nYet its essence never changes;\nBoundless and formless,\nIt circulates within all things,\nYet its function never falters.\nThus, it can generate all kinds,\nAnd be the master of all affairs.*\n\n*The *Zhongyong* says: \"Its nature is not dual,\nThus its creation of things is unfathomable.\"\nTherefore, the Great Polarity is the beginning of the Great Unfolding (*Taiyuan*),\nAnd the formless substance is the mother of all under Heaven.\nIts essence cannot be named and grasped,\nThus its name is unknown.\nIts function cannot be said to lack a name,\nThus it is called the Dao.\nNames arise from things, and things give rise to names—\nSince we have given it a name, we know it has a name.\nYet tracing its name reveals no clear meaning,\nExamining its function reveals its utmost greatness—\nThus, we forcibly name its function as Great.\nWhen speaking of its function, we call it Great,\nBut when speaking of its essence, it has already passed away.\nHow distant is the name from the reality?\nIt is said: its distance is not far—\nIt lies in knowing its return.\nTo return from name to reality,\nTo return from affairs to principle—\nGreatly applied to family and state,\nSlightly applied to self and mind—\nIf one cannot reflect inwardly, the principle of Heaven is extinguished.\nThus, the *Records* say:\n*\"The Dao is not distant from people;\nPeople distance themselves from the Dao,\nAnd those who distance themselves cannot be the Dao.*\nAgain, it says:\n*\"The Dao cannot be separated for even a moment;\nIf it can be separated, it is not the Dao.\"*\n\nThus, the earlier statement—\n*\"There exists a formless substance,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth\"*—\nIs the nameless Dao.\nThe later statement—\n*\"Passing means distant,\nDistant means returning\"*—\nIs the named Dao.\nTherefore, when the four greats of the realm are raised,\nThe Sage-King occupies one of them,\nTo make clear that the Sage-King participates in Heaven and Earth’s Dao,\nAnd assists in the transformation and nurturing of all things.\n\nAh, the realm’s clouds—\nThis makes clear that the Dao is not beyond the six directions.\nThus, those who rule over people\nShould model Earth’s stillness,\nTo make their essence still;\nThen model Heaven’s movement,\nTo make their function active;\nThen model the Dao’s effortless yet all-accomplishing.\nOnce they can effortlessly yet all-accomplish,\nThen they can model spontaneity,\nAnd all under Heaven will not know how it is done.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"Substance is the root of the insubstantial,\nStillness is the master of the restless.*\nThus, the virtuous person walks all day without leaving their baggage.\nThough they enjoy splendid sights,\nTheir hearts remain serene and detached.\n\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nLightly cast aside the weight of all under Heaven?\nLightness leads to losing one’s foundation,\nRestlessness leads to losing one’s master.\"\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"All things, though diverse,\nEach return to their roots—\nThus, substance can be the root of the insubstantial.\nAll under Heaven’s movement is steadfast in One—\nThus, stillness can be the master of the restless.*\n\nThose who travel far carry their baggage all day,\nYet never stray far from their heavy loads—\nFor their clothing and food depend upon them.\nIf they abandon it and stray far,\nThey will soon be exhausted and stranded upon the road.\nThus, the virtuous person’s heart always aligns with the Dao,\nThough externally surrounded by dazzling splendor and luxury,\nInternally they remain settled in simplicity,\nSerene and unattached—\nThis is the art of taking substance as root and stillness as master.\n\nThe ruler of ten thousand chariots\nDoes so because all under Heaven is their burden.\nHow can they lightly use their body without regard for all under Heaven?\nLightness leads to losing the foundation of national stability,\nRestlessness leads to losing Earth’s masterly stillness.\n\nThe people are the root of the state—\nIf the root is firm, the state is at peace.\nThis is the constant way of all sovereigns.\nTo cherish them brings loyalty,\nTo harm them brings vengeance—\nThis is the constant sentiment of all under Heaven.\n\nIf those who rule over people\nLightly use their bodies,\nIndulge desires without restraint,\nOppress the people,\nAnd disregard all under Heaven,\nThen the people will abandon them in droves.\nNot only will they abandon them,\nBut they will rise to harm them as well.\n\nThus, the Old Master, moved with pity,\nRepeatedly sighed and said:\n*\"To govern the self and mind,\nLightness leads to losing the return to root,\nRestlessness leads to losing steadfast unity.\nTo govern all under Heaven,\nLightness leads to losing the foundation of national peace,\nRestlessness leads to losing Earth’s masterly stillness.\"*\n\nAh, O Sovereign of the myriad chariots,\nHow can you not be weighty and tranquil?\n\n**Scripture:**\nThe skilled traveler leaves no tracks,\nThe skilled speaker leaves no flaws to censure,\nThe skilled strategist needs no reckoning tools,\nThe skilled guardian needs no locks yet cannot be opened,\nThe skilled binder needs no cords yet cannot be undone.\n\nThus, the Sage always excels in saving people,\nSo there are none abandoned;\nAlways excels in saving things,\nSo there are none discarded—\nThis is called *clinging to clarity*.\n\nTherefore, the virtuous become teachers for the unvirtuous,\nAnd the unvirtuous become resources for the virtuous.\nTo not honor one’s teacher,\nTo not cherish one’s resource—\nThough one may know much, it is utter confusion—\nThis is called the supreme subtlety.\n\n**Transmission:**\nThe skilled traveler acts through the Dao.\nThe Dao is vast, so virtue spreads broadly—\nThus, no tracks remain to follow.\nThe skilled speaker relies on *name*.\nWhen *name* is correct, reality is attained—\nThus, no flaws exist to censure.\nThe skilled strategist relies on *measure*.\nWhen *measure* is clear, calculations are simple—\nThus, no reckoning tools are needed, yet intricate calculations are achieved.\nThe skilled guardian seals the *mouth* (of excess),\nSo the mind does not stir—\nThus, no locks are needed, yet it cannot be breached.\nThe skilled binder binds with *truth*,\nSo the mind does not stray—\nThus, no cords are needed, yet it cannot be undone.\n\nHence, the *Records* say:\nBefore mourning was practiced among the people,\nThe people mourned;\nBefore reverence was practiced among the people,\nThe people revered.\nThe Yin made oaths, and the people began to rebel;\nThe Zhou held assemblies, and the people began to doubt.\nIf one lacks the loyal, sincere, and grieving heart to govern,\nEven the most firmly bound people will not remain steadfast.\n\nThus, these five skills are all the Sage’s essential methods of salvation.\n\nAs for people’s unvirtue—\nWhat is there to abandon?\n\nTherefore, the Son of Heaven establishes the Three Dukes,\nTo teach them.\nTo the virtuous, I am virtuous;\nTo the unvirtuous, I am also virtuous—\nThus, teaching abandons no one,\nAnd use discards nothing—\nThis is the subtle art of *knowing the constant*,\nHence called *clinging to clarity*.\n\nWhy?\nWhat the world values most is the teacher,\nWhat the world cherishes most is the resource—\nYet the virtuous become teachers for the unvirtuous\nPrecisely because the unvirtuous become resources for the virtuous.\nIf there were no unvirtuous as resources,\nThe virtuous would have no one to teach.\n\nAlas, when all under Heaven know virtue as virtue,\nThat is unvirtue;\nWhen all under Heaven do not know virtue as virtue,\nThat is perfect virtue.\n\nNow, those who do not honor their teachers\nDo not wish to conform to what the multitude calls virtuous,\nBut to display what is unvirtuous;\nThose who do not cherish their resources\nDo not wish to use others’ unvirtue to perfect their own virtue.\n\nThough one may know these words on dishonoring and disdaining teachers and resources\nAre greatly misguided for the age,\nTheir essence is the subtle art of salvation—\nThe supreme refinement of method.\n\n**Scripture:**\nKnow the *heroic* and hold to the *receptive*—\nThus, you become the valley of the world.\nTo be the valley of the world,\nYour virtue remains unchanging—\nReturning to the infant.\nKnow the *white* and hold to the *black*—\nThus, you become the model of the world.\nTo be the model of the world,\nYour virtue does not err—\nReturning to the boundless.\nKnow the *honored* and hold to the *humiliated*—\nThus, you become the valley of the world.\nTo be the valley of the world,\nYour virtue is complete—\nReturning to the uncarved.\n\nThe uncarved scatters to become things;\nThe Sage uses them to become officials and leaders—\nThus, the great measure is not cut.\n\n**Transmission:**\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nAll things function with the *heroic* strong and the *receptive* weak,\nThe male active and the female tranquil—\nEven in rank and precedence, none deviate from this.\n\nThe Old Master delved deeply into the nature of things,\nEstablished methods accordingly,\nKnowing that weakness overcomes strength,\nThus using weakness as function,\nKnowing that tranquility overcomes action,\nThus taking tranquility as master.\n\nTherefore, he places himself last, yet leads first;\nHe lowers his path, yet it is held in highest esteem—\nThus, though he stands foremost, the people do not weary of him;\nThough he is above, the people do not resent him.\n\nHence, knowing that the *heroic* cannot endure,\nHe guards himself with the *receptive*—\nThus, he can become the valley of the world.\n\nThe valley is used through its lowliness.\nOnly by embracing lowliness\nDoes virtue never depart.\nWhen virtue does not depart,\nOne can align with the Dao—\nThus, returning to the infant,\nCalm as if without knowledge.\nOnly by having no knowledge\nDoes the mind become clear.\nThough one knows it is clear,\nYet guarding it in silent mystery—\nThus, one can become the model of the world.\n\nThe *model* is what can be imitated and followed.\nOnly what can be imitated and followed\nDoes virtue never stray.\nWhen virtue does not stray,\nOne harmonizes with the Dao—\nThus, returning to the boundless, deep and unrecognizable.\nThough unrecognizable,\nIt shines forth daily—\nThus, its path is honored and bright.\nThough one knows it is honored and bright,\nYet guarding it with the muddled and humiliated—\nThus, one can become the valley of the world.\n\nThe *valley* is substantial in being yet empty in use.\nOnly by being substantial in being and empty in use\nIs virtue fully sufficient.\nWhen virtue is fully sufficient,\nOne can return to the nameless uncarved—\nAlso, one will have no desires.\n\nAh! The Great Dao is abandoned, and *ren* and *yi* arise;\nThe Great Uncarved scatters into things.\nThe Sage uses these things,\nThus becoming the leader of the multitude.\nOnly the Great Dao, not being a thing,\nCan use these formed things;\nThe great measure, not being cut,\nCan govern the myriad things.\nIf one is not immersed in the Dao yet wishes to use the world’s things,\nOr is constrained by things yet wishes to govern the world’s multitude,\nI must see it as perilous.\n\nThe *Records* say:\nProfit and righteousness,\nWisdom and benevolence—\nThese are the tools of the hegemons and kings.\nTo use them—\nHow can one avoid this path?\n\n**Scripture:**\nIf one seeks to take the world and act upon it,\nI see it as inevitable failure.\nThe world is a divine vessel—\nIt cannot be acted upon.\nTo act upon it is to ruin it;\nTo grasp it is to lose it.\n\nThus, things sometimes advance, sometimes follow,\nSometimes exhale, sometimes inhale,\nSometimes strong, sometimes weak,\nSometimes uplifted, sometimes collapsed.\n\nThus, the Sage removes excess, removes extravagance, removes excessiveness.\n\n**Scripture:**\nThe world is the world of the world, not the Sage’s alone.\nTherefore, Yao could not give the world to Shun by force, nor could Yu give it to Qi by force—\nit was the world that gave itself to Shun and Qi.\nThus, Yao and Yu merely followed its will.\n\nIf the world does not give itself, and one seeks to seize it by force,\nI have never seen one who could take it,\nlet alone hold it.\n\nWhy is this?\nThe world is like a divine vessel of great clarity—\nnot something one can seize by intelligence or strength.\nIf one seizes it by force though it does not give itself,\nthe endeavor will surely fail.\nIf one grasps it though the world does not willingly yield,\none’s own person will surely perish.\n\nFor when things advance before,\nthere will be those who follow after;\nwhen warmth is given,\nthere will be cold to follow;\nwhen strength is used to dominate,\nthere will be force to counter it;\nwhen one plants and nurtures,\nthere will be those who uproot and destroy.\n\nThus, if one seizes by force,\nothers will seize it back by force.\nTherefore, the Sage knows the world cannot be taken by intelligence or strength,\nand so takes it by doing nothing.\nWhen the Dao is complete and virtue established,\nthe world gives itself willingly,\nand thus the world gladly follows without tiring.\n\nThe Sage governs by non-action,\nand so removes excess by not seizing by force,\nremoves extravagance by not grasping possession,\nremoves excessiveness by not refusing to yield.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"The overbearing dragon regrets it.\"*\nThe meaning of *overbearing*—\nknowing how to advance but not how to retreat,\nknowing how to preserve but not how to perish,\nknowing how to gain but not how to lose—\nonly the Sage knows how to advance and retreat,\npreserve and perish,\nwithout losing the proper way.\nOnly the Sage understands this—\nthis is its meaning.\n\n**Scripture:**\nThose who assist the sovereign with the Dao\ndo not use force to compel the world,\nfor their deeds return to them.\nWhere the army encamps,\nthorns and brambles grow.\nAfter great armies pass,\nthere will surely be years of famine.\n\nThus, the virtuous act decisively but do not seize by force.\nAct decisively but do not boast,\nact decisively but do not vaunt,\nact decisively but do not be arrogant—\nthough decisive, they do not act by force.\nWhen things are strong, they grow old—\nthis is called *not the Dao*,\nand *not the Dao* brings early ruin.\n\n**Scripture:**\nThose who assist the sovereign with the Dao\nmust win hearts with virtue,\nnot use arms to compel the world.\nFor if one seizes strength from others,\nothers will hate it.\nIf the world’s people hate it,\nthe world’s armies will rise against it.\nThus, if I seize strength from others,\nothers will seize victory from me.\nWhat is done to oneself returns to oneself—\nthus, their deeds return to them.\n\nWhere armies dwell,\nfarming is neglected,\nand thorns grow in the fields.\nLooms stand idle in the villages,\nand the people are burdened with slaughter,\ndisturbing the harmonious *qi*—\nthen drought and flood will surely follow,\nand years of famine will ensue.\n\nHuman affairs are as they are,\nand Heaven’s will is as it is—\nthen can war be avoided?\nIt is said:\nHeaven produces the five elements;\nto neglect one is impossible—\nwho can abolish war?\n\nWar cannot be abolished,\nbut its use must follow the Dao.\nThus, the ancients who skillfully used war\nacted decisively but did not seize by force.\n\nWhat is meant by *decisive*?\nDo not boast in one’s abilities,\ndo not vaunt one’s achievements,\ndo not be arrogant in one’s heart.\nThough decisive in these three things,\none must still act only when unavoidable,\nand though decisive in achieving victory,\none must still not dare to seize by force—\nthis is *decisive yet not forceful*.\n\nTo boast in one’s abilities is to love war;\nto love war is to be unable to settle the people.\nTo vaunt one’s achievements is to invite contention;\nto invite contention is to be unable to harmonize the masses.\nTo be arrogant is to provoke strife;\nto provoke strife is to be unable to enrich the realm.\n\nIf these three *decisive* virtues are lost,\nthe seven virtues are all abandoned,\nand the love of victory knows no end—\nrelying on strength to seize by force,\nthis is the path to ruin.\n\nAh! When things are strong, they grow old;\nwhen armies are strong, they meet defeat—\nthis is the natural order,\nand one must take heed.\n\nMoreover, the Dao uses weakness for effectiveness,\nwhile war uses strength to win—\nthis clearly does not align with the Dao.\nIf one does not retreat in time, regret will come;\nif one does not abandon the Dao early, great defeat will follow.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Lost and returning—disaster.\nThere will be calamity and misfortune.\nUsing armies—surely there will be great defeat.\nThe sovereign’s misfortune will last ten years without victory—\nthis is what is meant by not abandoning early.\"*\n\n**Scripture:**\nFine weapons are ominous instruments—\nthings often hate them,\nand so those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\n\nThe gentleman, at home, values the left;\nin war, values the right.\nWar is an ominous instrument,\nnot the instrument of the gentleman—\nit is used only when unavoidable,\nand calmness is supreme.\n\nTo win yet not rejoice in victory,\nbut to rejoice is to delight in killing.\nThose who delight in killing\ncannot achieve their desires in the world.\n\nAuspicious matters favor the left,\nominous matters favor the right.\nThe left general is placed on the left,\nthe right general on the right—\nthis is to treat war as a funeral rite.\nWhen many are killed,\none should weep in sorrow,\nand victory should be treated as a funeral rite.\n\n**Scripture:**\nThose who excel in military strategy\nare not auspicious or virtuous materials.\nEven ordinary things may hate their intent—\nhow could those who follow the Dao comfortably engage in such matters?\n\nFor the Dao of Heaven and Earth:\nthe left is yang, the right is yin.\nYang governs virtue and life,\nyin governs punishment and death.\nThus, in peace, the gentleman places the virtuous on the left—\nthis is why the left is honored.\nIn war, the brave are placed on the right—\nthis is why the right is honored.\n\nThe gentleman values life as virtue,\nwhile warriors value killing as achievement—\nthus, those who know war are wielding ominous instruments,\nnot the instruments of the gentleman.\n\n「If one encounters the barbarous and the alien, the cunning and the treacherous, the marauders and the deceitful—\nthen one must reluctantly employ them,\nyet never be the first to initiate conflict.\nThus it is said:\n*\"One does not dare to be the aggressor but the defender,\nnor to advance an inch while retreating a foot.\"*\n\nTo remain tranquil in the face of gain,\nand indifferent to the desire for victory—\nthis is the highest virtue.\nTo dare boldly to advance through valor,\nand to delight in slaughter—\nthis is not the noble pursuit.\n\nThe true art lies in bending others without battle,\nnot in glorifying conquest through war—\nwhy so?\n\nFor all wars are won by the multitude of slain—\nthose who praise such victory are those who take pleasure in killing.\nThose who take pleasure in killing,\nothers will also take pleasure in killing them—\nnot only will others kill them,\nbut Heaven itself will punish them.\nWhy so?\n\nLife is the greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth—\nthose who take pleasure in killing defy Heaven’s virtue.\nIf such men were to prevail in the world,\nthen nearly all people would perish.\n\nHeaven will not aid them,\nand what of men?\n\nMoreover, in auspicious rites, one bows and honors the left,\nwhile in inauspicious rites, one bows and honors the right.\nThe subordinate general, an aide to the military,\nthus resides on the left.\nThe supreme general, the master of the military,\nthus resides on the right.\nThis is why he resides on the right—\nhe holds the higher position of command.\nThose who occupy the higher position are honored on the right,\nand thus victory is treated as a funeral rite.\n\nThe conqueror in battle is he who slays many—\nyet he should weep in sorrow for the slain,\nfor victory is treated as a funeral rite.\nThe earlier words spoke of an inauspicious instrument,\nand now it is said that victory is treated as a funeral rite—\nboth are repeated laments,\nfor the cruelty of killing is deeply abhorred.\n\n**Scripture:**\nThe Dao is always nameless,\nyet the Uncarved (朴) is small—\nthough small, the world dare not enslave it.\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nall things would come willingly.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth combine,\nsweet dew descends—\nno one commands it,\nyet it is evenly distributed.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe Dao endures because of its nameless essence.\nThis nameless essence is also called the nameless Uncarved (朴),\nwhose form is exceedingly subtle and minute,\nyet whose Dao is supremely noble and vast—\nthus it becomes the origin of Heaven and Earth,\nand the world dare not enslave it.\nIf lords and kings could guard this nameless Uncarved (朴),\nthen all things would submit in service.\n\nThus, when mountains are high, the wild rams come,\nand when waters are deep, the dragon spirits arrive.\nIf mountains were not high,\nor waters not deep,\neven divine creatures would not come—\nhow much more so for ordinary things?\n\nWhen the central harmonious *qi* of Heaven and Earth combines,\nthen nourishing dew descends upon all things,\nand all things are evenly blessed by its grace—\nnone can command it to be so.\n\nIf lords and kings could emulate the central harmony of Heaven and Earth,\nand uphold the Dao of the Uncarved and its application,\nthen their virtue would spread universally throughout the world,\nand the world would not know how it came to be—\nthis is what is meant by:\n*\"If lords and kings could guard it,\nall things would come willingly.\"*\n\n**Scripture:**\nWhen naming first began,\nonce names were established,\none would also know when to stop—\nto know when to stop is to avoid peril.\n\nThe Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the great seas.\n\n**Explication:**\nBy \"beginning,\" it refers to the nameless.\nOnly the nameless essence can govern the use of names—\nonce names are established,\nthey will wander without restraint.\nThus one must also know when to stop,\nto halt at the proper place—\nnames halt at their proper place,\naffairs halt at their proper principles.\nTo know when to stop and do so,\nis to avoid danger and peril.\n\nThen, what is meant by \"names halt at their proper place\"?\nIt means to fulfill the names—\nthus one follows names to supervise their fulfillment,\nand examines fulfillment to rectify the names.\nWhen names and fulfillment correspond,\nthe state is well-ordered;\nwhen they do not correspond,\nthe state is chaotic.\nNames arise from fulfillment,\nfulfillment arises from names—\nnames and fulfillment give rise to each other,\nyet they also oppose each other—\nthus the sagely ruler uses the *契* (契) to hold names accountable.\n\nNames are the world’s net,\nthe sage’s talisman.\nTo cast the world’s net,\nand wield the sage’s talisman,\nthen the emotions of all things have no place to escape.\n\nThus, to scrutinize names and restore their fulfillment,\nand to examine fulfillment and correct the names,\nthen right and wrong become as clear as white and black.\nThus, to separate them is to make them two,\nto unite them is to make them one—\nright and wrong follow names and fulfillment,\nrewards and punishments follow right and wrong.\nThus, to perceive their forms,\nto achieve their shapes,\nto follow their principles,\nto correct their names—\nthis is why it is said:\n*\"Names are self-appointed,\nthen affairs are self-determined.\"*\n\nOne follows names to appoint them,\nand examines affairs to rectify them.\nThus, when Yao governed the world,\nhe used names—\nhis names were correct,\nand the world was well-ordered.\nWhen Jie governed the world,\nhe also used names—\nhis names were perverse,\nand the world was chaotic.\nThus, names are what the sage holds most dear.\n\nMaster Zhongni said:\n*\"It must be so—\none must correct the names!\"*\nIf names are not corrected,\nthen the ruler will be burdened with cares and labors;\nif the ruler is burdened with cares and labors,\nthen the offices and duties will be disorderly.\nThe more one seeks the black,\nthe more one finds the white—\nyet the more one seeks it,\nthe more one fails to obtain it.\nIf names are corrected,\nthen the ruler will have no cares or labors;\nwithout cares or labors,\nhe will not tax the ears and eyes of his people—\nand all undertakings will be steadfast.\nHe will follow forms to assign roles,\nnot be constrained by things,\nand govern without action—\nclearly and impartially,\nhis spirit will permeate the six directions,\nhis intent will survey the boundless—\nthis is what is meant by:\n*\"To know when to stop is to avoid peril.\"*\n\nThe great seas are where rivers and valleys converge,\nand the nameless is where all names cease.\nThus, all undertakings of the world\nreturn to the Dao in this manner.\n\n**Scripture:**\nHe who knows others is wise,\nhe who knows himself is enlightened.\nHe who conquers others has strength,\nhe who conquers himself is powerful.\nHe who knows contentment is rich,\nhe who perseveres in action has resolve.\nHe who does not lose his place endures,\nhe who dies yet does not perish attains longevity.\n\n**Explication:**\nKnowledge that comes from without is called wisdom—\nlike the external radiance of the sun and fire.\nKnowledge that reflects inward is called enlightenment—\nlike the internal reflection of metal and water.\n\nTo use gentleness to overcome others’ violence\nis the strength of one who follows the Dao;\nto uphold softness and conquer one’s own agitation\nis the power of one who possesses virtue.\n\nHe who knows contentment in worldly gains and desires\ndoes not lose his great undertaking—\nthus he is called rich.\nHe who perseveres in benevolence and righteousness\ncan attain great virtue—\nthus he is called one of resolve.\n\nHe who does not lose his place endures,\nhe who dies yet does not perish attains longevity.»\n\n---\n\n**Explication:**\nThe Dao moves without losing its place—\nthus the body may endure long.\nDeath comes, yet the Way does not perish—\nthus it is called longevity.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe Great Dao flows unrestrained,\nyet it may be found on either side.\nAll things depend upon it for life,\nyet it does not decline to bestow.\nIt fulfills its function yet does not dwell upon it,\nnurturing all things yet claiming no mastery.\n\nEver without desire, it may be called *small*—\nyet when all things return to it without making it their lord,\nit may be called *great*.\n\nTherefore, the Sage never claims to be great,\nand thus he achieves his greatness.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe application of the Great Dao,\nis it not like the virtue of ghosts and spirits?\nIt flows freely, found on left or right.\nIt drifts boundlessly, as if above or before and behind.\n\nAs the mother of all things, it is relied upon for life.\nIn harmony with Heaven and Earth in virtue, its work is easily accomplished.\nBecause its intimacy is supreme, it never denies its virtue.\nBecause its magnitude is absolute, it never claims its deeds.\n\nIt cherishes all creatures, fostering them without slaughter,\nthus ever without desire, observing its marvel—\nthen its simplicity may be named *small*.\nAll things return to it without making it their sovereign lord,\nlike streams and valleys yielding to rivers and seas—\nthen its Dao may be named *great*.\n\nWhen streams and valleys flow into the rivers and seas,\nthey receive without satiety—\nthis is because they never exalt themselves.\nWhen all under Heaven return to the Sage,\nhe accepts them without weariness—\nthis is because he never claims to be great.\n\nThe Sage upholds the humble simplicity of the *small* (undifferentiated),\nyet never considers himself great—\nthus he becomes the guest of all things,\nand ultimately achieves his greatness.\n\n**Explication:**\nHold the Great Image, and all under Heaven will follow.\nFollow yet cause no harm—\nthen peace and tranquility prevail.\n\nJoy and bait,\nyet travelers pass on without lingering.\nThe Way, when spoken of, is bland without flavor.\nTo gaze upon it is insufficient to see,\nto listen to it is insufficient to hear—\nyet its use is never exhausted.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe Great Image is the Way.\nHe who can grasp the ancient Way to govern the present,\nall things under Heaven will return and follow.\n\nThe Sage views the people as tender children,\nfearing to harm them—\nhow much more would he avoid harming them in times of crisis?\nIf he never harms them, then those who return and follow\nwill suffer no injury from him.\n\nIf none suffer injury, then all under Heaven will dwell in ease and tranquility.\nJoy can delight the ear,\nbait can satisfy the palate—\nthen wayfarers will linger, travelers will revel,\nthough they may feel pleasure in the moment,\nyet it is not their true resting place,\nand they cannot remain long.\n\nThus the *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"The bird burns its nest,\nthe wayfarer laughs first, then weeps bitterly.\"*\n\nHe who upholds the Great Image is not thus.\nHe does not display desire for pleasure to the people,\nso when his words leave his mouth, they are bland without flavor;\nwhen his teachings enter the heart, they are serene without adornment.\nThough faint and subtle, they are not sufficient for sight or hearing,\nyet their use is inexhaustible,\ntheir measure never depleted—\nspanning myriad ages without end.\n\n**Explication:**\nHe who would gather must first disperse;\nhe who would weaken must first strengthen;\nhe who would discard must first promote;\nhe who would take away must first give.\nThis is called *subtle enlightenment*.\n\nSoftness overcomes hardness—\nfish cannot escape the depths,\nthe sharpest tools of state\nshould not be displayed to the people.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe Sage’s profound depths are most wondrous in *power and expedience* (权实).\n*Expedience* (权) takes *harmony with nature* (顺常) as its essence,\n*power* (实) employs *contrary measures* (反经) as its function.\n*Expedience* aids *power*,\n*power* implements *expedience*—\nthough they differ in name,\ntheir purpose converges in unity.\n\nThe Master Lao first guided with *power*,\nestablishing the teaching of *constant knowledge*;\nthen he employed *expedience* to aid the people,\nillustrating the principle of *contrary action*.\n\nThis is what the *Classic of Changes* speaks of:\n*\"The bending completes all things without loss,\nthe encompassing contains Heaven and Earth without excess.\"*\n\nTo remove the strong and violent,\nto overturn the obscurantist and cruel—\none must rely upon their hearts of gain and desire,\nand employ the arts of *gathering and dispersing*.\n\nThe use of these arts is thus:\nWhen their hearts of gain and desire are at their peak,\none must indulge them to the fullest, letting them expand.\nThey delight in indulgence, and their true nature is revealed—\nthen one may gather them to bring them to order.\n\nAs in the *Classic of Changes*’ **\"#2\" (明夷)**—\nthe fourth hexagram:\n*\"Entering the left flank, capturing the heart of the obscurantist,\nnot stepping outside the gate.\"*\n\nWhen indulgence is indulged to its utmost,\nthe heart of excess grows ever greater—\nthus it is gathered by all.\n\nThis art is subtle yet clear,\nthe Sage’s hidden means of action.\n\nAs for weakening their resolve and *qi*,\none must first strengthen their cravings and desires.\nGreat love brings great expenditure,\ndesire pushed to its limit weakens the resolve.\n\nSmall use is upon the body and heart,\ngreat use is upon all under Heaven.\nDiscarding and promoting, taking and giving,\nmutually reinforce each other—\nthis is the natural principle,\nwhere *contrary* becomes *harmonious*.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe Way’s motion is *contrary*;\nthe Way’s function is *weakening*.\nTo govern with softness and weakness,\novercoming hardness and strength—\nthis is the *contrary* in use,\nand the *contrary* in use truly governs *expedience*.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"The *submissive* (巽) moves to apply *expedience*.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"The *submissive* is steady when it conforms.\"*\n\nThe *submissive* (巽) as an image is the wind.\nWind responds to the four seasons,\nbending all things—\nyet no one sees its form.\n\n*Expedience* rides the natural course of Heaven,\nadapts to the changes of the world—\nyet no one knows its use.\n\nThe meaning of *submissive* (巽) is *yielding*.\nYielding and submission can apply *expedience*,\nand when *expedience* is applied,\nit can govern the world—\nthus softness and weakness can overcome hardness and strength,\nand the meaning is most evident while the function is most hidden.\n\nHow can this be made clear?\nIn ancient times, King Wen ruled one-third of all under Heaven,\nyet he still bowed and submitted to the tyrant Zhou (纣).\nHe offered the lands of *Lacquer* (漆) and *Stagnant* (沮),\nand requested the abolition of the *Branding* (炮烙) punishment.\n\nWhen Zhou’s greedy heart burned fiercely,\nKing Wen offered the lands—\nthis was indulging them to let them expand.\nZhou, once he gained the lands, rejoiced—\nthus King Wen requested the removal of his punishment,\nthis was gathering them to bring them to order—\nthis was King Wen’s *expedience*.\n\nIn ancient times, King Wu surveyed his troops at the *Ming River Crossing* (盟津),\nsaying, *\"The evil of Zhou has not yet reached its peak.\"*\nThus he returned his army for two years,\nbefore raising the *Mao Field* (牧野) campaign.\n\n「Thus, King Wu’s return to the Ming River Crossing was to fully indulge the tyrant’s arrogance, while his campaign at the Mao Field was to gather the people’s resentment to its extreme—this was King Wu’s *expedience*.\n\nIn ancient times, King Wen, through the Dao of gentle softness, though aware that the Yin people could not endure Zhou’s cruelty, still wished to completely remove Zhou before accepting them—this was King Wen’s *substance*.\n\nKing Wu, through the virtue/power of resolute strength, swiftly recognized that the Yin people could not bear Zhou’s tyranny, and thus hastened to slay Zhou before claiming their lands—this was King Wu’s *substance*.\n\nThe brothers Bo Yi (伯夷) and Shu Qi (叔齐) upheld King Wen’s *substance* and corrected King Wu’s *expedience*, declaring that a subject should not overthrow a sovereign as a precedent. They sought to establish the Three Bonds (三纲) for future generations, thus they collectively abandoned King Wu and starved to death at Shouyang (首阳).\n\nThe Duke of Zhou (太公) aided King Wu’s *expedience* and inverted King Wen’s *substance*, asserting that slaying the tyrannical Zhou would bring peace to the realm. He aimed to rescue the myriad people in the present age, thus he soared like an eagle and followed King Wu, unleashing devastation upon the Great Shang (大商).\n\nThe Duke of Zhou (周公) and the Duke of Shao (召公) completed the deeds of Wen and Wu, intending to secretly preserve the *expedience* of rectifying chaos while openly promoting the *substance* of governance and peace. Thus, they rested the oxen and released the horses, overturned the chariots and laid down the weapons, inquired about the *Great Response* (洪范) from Ji Zi (箕子), relocated the stubborn people to Luoyi (洛邑), established rituals and composed music, laid down arms and cultivated culture, spreading the influence of the Two Southern Schools (二南) and securing the eight-hundred-year prosperity of the Zhou (八百之祚). This was another instance of using *expedience* to invert *substance* on the grandest scale.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* (《易》) states:\n*\"The opening and closing of one gate is called change (变),*\n*and the ceaseless movement between extremes is called harmony (通).\"*\n\nThese are subtle teachings,\nwhereby *expedience* and *substance* complement each other.\n\nAh! The Sage’s use of *expedience* aligns with the Dao,\nwhile the petty man’s misuse of *expedience* serves his deceit.\nA fish that escapes the deep pool cannot swim,\n*Expedience* that departs from *substance* cannot be applied.\n\nFor *expedience* is a sharp instrument of statecraft—\nit must be deeply concealed,\nsecretly employed,\nand never openly displayed,\nlest men seize it to incite disorder.\n\nThus Confucius said:\n*\"One may be capable of following the Dao,*\n*but not yet of establishing it.*\n*One may be capable of establishing it,*\n*but not yet of wielding *expedience*.*\"\n\nIn the *Hexagram of Qian* (□乾) at line four:\n*\"One leaps into the deep pool—*\n*no blame.\"*\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"There is no fixed hierarchy of high and low,*\n*this is not perverse (邪).*\n*There is no constant forward or retreat,*\n*this is not abandonment of the group (离群).*\n*The Noble One advances in virtue/power and cultivates his undertakings,*\n*seeking to fulfill his potential in due time—*\n*thus there is no blame.\"*\n\nIn the *Hexagram of Kun* (《坤》) at line four:\n*\"Gather the sack—*\n*no blame, no praise.\"*\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"When Heaven and Earth undergo transformation,*\n*grasses and trees flourish.*\n*When Heaven and Earth close in stillness,*\n*virtuous men withdraw.*\n*To gather the sack is without blame,*\n*for it signifies restraint (谨),*\n*and caution (慎) does no harm.*\n\nThus, the use of *expedience* is something the Sage finds difficult and cautious—\nhow can it not be guarded with care?\nHow can it not be guarded with care?\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The Dao endures without action,*\n*yet nothing remains undone.*\n*If lords and kings can uphold*\n*this art of the Origin and the Mother,*\n*all things shall naturally transform.*\n*When transformation is complete,*\n*I shall govern with the nameless simplicity (无名之朴).*\n*The nameless simplicity,*\n*too, shall not desire action.*\n*Without desire, it remains tranquil—*\n*thus the realm shall naturally rectify itself.\"*\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"The Dao endures as constant*\n*because its essence is nameless,*\n*thus it acts without action,*\n*and its function is named,*\n*thus it accomplishes all things without omission.*\n*If lords and kings can uphold*\n*this art of the Origin and the Mother,*\n*then the principles of all things shall be attained,*\n*and the affairs of the realm shall be set right—*\n*this is what is meant by*\n*'I act without action, yet the people transform themselves.'*\n\nOnce virtue/power and transformation become pure,\nthe realm attains clarity and tranquility.\nIf the emotions of profit and desire begin to sprout,\nI shall firmly establish and rectify this great Dao\nwith its fundamental simplicity,\nso that nothing may stir them.\n\nThe *Highest Virtue* (上德) acts without action,\nyet nothing is left undone—\nthus it aligns with the Dao.\nThe *Lower Virtue* (下德) acts with action,\nyet something is left undone—\nthus it aligns with virtue/power.\n\nThose who attain virtue/power\nmust inevitably lose the Dao,\nthus one who has the heart of non-action\nshall naturally display the traces of non-action.\nFuture generations shall seek its traces\nwhile forgetting its root—\nthus they arrive at non-action\nyet fall into action.\nHence it is said:\n*'The nameless simplicity,*\n*too, shall not desire action'*\n—meaning to make both heart and trace forgotten,\nthus reaching the *Mysterious of Mysteries* (玄之又玄).\n\nIf one can forget both heart and trace,\nand harmonize with the mysterious principles,\nthen all under Heaven shall naturally fulfill their true nature,\nand bear no burden from the traces of things.\n\nThe first chapter takes the constant Dao as its essence,\nconstant names as its function,\nand culminates in the *Triply Mysterious* (重玄).\nThis chapter takes non-action as its essence,\nand the fulfillment of all things as its function,\nunifying them in the principle of *comprehensive forgetting* (兼忘).\nThe beginning and end are interconnected,\nthus exhausting its essence and function.\n\n*Transmission of the True

(吴郡).*」\n\n*The True Dao/Virtue Classic, Volume III*\n\n**The Classic:**\nThe highest virtue does not claim virtue—thus it truly has virtue.\nThe lowest virtue does not abandon virtue—thus it lacks virtue.\nThe highest virtue acts without striving, yet nothing is left undone—thus it has no striving.\nThe lowest virtue strives, yet nothing is accomplished—thus it has striving.\n\nThe highest benevolence acts without striving—thus it is truly benevolent.\nThe highest righteousness acts with striving—thus it is truly righteous.\nThe highest propriety acts with striving, yet none respond—so it forces arms and persists.\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;\nwhen virtue is lost, benevolence follows;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;\nwhen righteousness is lost, propriety follows.\n\nFor propriety, though thin as loyalty and trust,\nis the first root of chaos.\nDiscernment#1, though the bloom of the Dao,\nis the beginning of folly.\nHence, the true man dwells in its substance, not its bloom;\ninhabits its depth, not its thinness—\nthus he discards that and takes this.\n\n**The Transmission:**\nThe highest virtue aligns with the Dao,\nnot claiming virtue, thus having constant virtue.\nThe lowest virtue loses the Dao yet clings to virtue—\nclaiming virtue, thus lacking constant virtue.\nThe highest virtue’s function follows Nature—\nthus, without striving, it is without striving.\nThe lowest virtue’s function follows non-action—\nthus, with striving, it strives.\n\nBenevolence is universal love—\nall actions are striving, yet he who does not claim benevolence as his deed is the highest.\nRighteousness is the prohibition of wrong—\nall actions are striving, yet he who does not claim righteousness as his gain is the highest.\nWhy so? If benevolence is claimed as a deed, then one is hindered by the act of benevolence itself.\nIf righteousness is not claimed as a gain, then one will yield to what is unrighteous.\n\nFor the highest propriety,\nit serves to distinguish rank and settle the people’s resolve.\nBut when it comes to displaying jade and silk,\nvaluing etiquette and reciprocity—\nthese are the trivial extremities of propriety.\nNow, if one reveres propriety toward others,\nyet others do not respond,\nhe is indeed one who has slighted propriety.\nBut if I, in turn, change countenance and strain to draw him forth,\nthen my offense is far greater than his.\nFor propriety exists to prevent strife—\nwhen lost to its trivialities, it instead provokes strife.\nThis is the common fate of the world,\nthose who do not grasp propriety’s great foundation.\n\nThe Master Lao held forth these extreme violations of propriety,\nmocking their cause of strife,\nto urge men to return to propriety’s root\nand rejoin the *Great Unity* (太一).\n\n*The Record* says:\nLove others without intimacy—then you have inverted benevolence.\nRevere propriety yet receive no response—then you have inverted respect.\nThus, conquer yourself and restore propriety without reproaching others.\n\n*The Book of Changes* says:\nUse humility to regulate propriety.\nAnd again:\nHumility is the handle of virtue.\nIf one can grasp humility’s handle,\nthe root of propriety restored,\nthen all will proceed without obstruction—\nhow could there be any loss from forcing or persisting?\n\nMoreover, the highest virtue aligns with non-action by Nature—\nwhen lost from the highest virtue,\nit follows non-action—\nthus it is said, *\"When the Dao is lost, virtue follows.\"*\n\nIf one follows non-action,\nvirtue’s works are established;\nif one acts with striving,\nbenevolence’s deeds appear;\nif one restrains and benefits,\nthe highest righteousness is clear;\nif one regulates and prevents,\nthe highest propriety is set.\nThus it is said,\n*\"When virtue is lost, benevolence follows;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;\nwhen righteousness is lost, propriety follows.\"*\n\nFor what is lost in one is gained in another—\nthis is the universal principle.\nThus, the essence of loyalty and trust decays within,\nwhile the seeds of chaos take root—\nso propriety is established to prevent its outbreak,\nand propriety stands at the head of chaos.\n\nThe Dao’s bloom manifests externally,\nwhile folly and confusion arise—\nso discernment is exalted to guide the foolish.\nThus, discernment is the origin of folly.\n\nDiscernment is foresight’s clarity,\nilluminating principles yet to take form.\nYet benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and discernment\nare all the Sage’s timely applications,\nto rise or fall with the times,\nto flourish or decline with the age.\nThus, clinging to the ancient while governing the present,\nthe Dao and virtue are its foundation,\nwhile propriety and discernment are its extremities.\nTransforming the present to restore the ancient,\npropriety’s regulation is its beginning,\nwhile the Dao and virtue are its end—\nthis is what is meant by *\"reduce it, reduce it, until it reaches non-action.\"*\n\nTo raise swine for wine is not to make wine a calamity,\nyet wine’s spread brings calamity.\nBenevolence, righteousness, propriety, and discernment\nare not to make chaos,\nyet their misuse brings chaos as a consequence.\nThe perplexed do not know that desire for gain is the source of chaos,\nand so blame the Sage’s wisdom,\nsaying that to sever and abandon them\nwould restore the governance of ancient times—\nhow far astray are they, how far astray!\n\nThus it is said:\nTo discuss propriety in the age of purity—\neither madness or perversity.\nTo forget propriety in the age of corruption—\neither stupidity or slander.\n\nIn seeking the source and returning to the origin,\ndiscarding trivialities and reclaiming the root,\nrestoring righteousness and propriety to return to benevolence and virtue,\nemploying named forms while dwelling in the formless—\nthen the Dao of Nature will not be distant before it is restored.\n\nThis is what is meant by the true man—\nhe will sever this without doubt,\ndwelling securely in the foundation of the Dao and virtue,\nnot hindered by the extremities of propriety and discernment.\nWhy is this so? Laws established in governance still breed chaos;\nlaws established in chaos—what would their consequences be?\nThus, discard that which is trivial and superficial,\ntake this which is profound and substantial—\nthis is the deep intention of clinging to the ancient while governing the present.\n\nAh! Even propriety has its place—\noffering sacrifices to Heaven with a single libation, valuing sincerity.\nUsing earthenware and gourds for vessels, valuing simplicity.\nRevealing wine’s practical use while esteeming its mysterious worth,\nsettling coarse baskets with care while arranging reeds for adornment—\nall these value the root.\nHow can they be neglected?\n\n**The Classic:**\nIn ancient times, those who attained *Oneness* (一),\nHeaven attained it and became clear,\nEarth attained it and became tranquil,\nThe *Spirit* (神) attained it and became responsive,\nThe *Grains* (谷) attained it and became full,\nAll things attained it and flourished,\nRulers attained it and became steadfast for the world.\n\nTheir attainment was through Oneness—\nHeaven without clarity would fear collapse,\nEarth without tranquility would fear eruption,\nThe Spirit without responsiveness would fear extinction,\nThe Grains without fullness would fear depletion,\nAll things without flourishing would fear annihilation,\nRulers without steadfastness would fear ruin—\nand so the noble would fear elevation.\n\nThus, nobility must have humility as its root,\nelevation must have lowliness as its foundation—\nso it takes this and discards that.\n\nThus, the noble rulers call themselves *Lone* (孤), *Few* (寡), and *Not Grains* (不谷)—this is their way of taking lowliness as root.\nIs it not so?\nHence, they do not seek the splendor of *glittering jade* (琭琭), nor the rigidity of *flint-like stone* (珞珞).\n\nThe *Classical* says:\nThe *One* (一) is the child of the *Dao/Way* (道), the origin of all things.\nIf one can embrace its child and restore its origin, then all things will naturally fulfill their *principle of life* (生之理).\nEven the *Dao/Way* of Heaven and its *Divine Brilliance* (神明), the *Dao/Way* of Earth and its *Mountainous Depths* (山谷),\nall achieve clarity and responsiveness, tranquility and fullness, because of their attainment of the *One*.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* (《易》) says: *\"All movement under Heaven is rooted in the steadfastness of the One.\"*\nThus, when rulers attain it, they become steadfast for the world—\nthe means by which they attain it is through the *One Dao/Way*.\nYet, though they attain it,\nthey must not rely upon it—\ntherefore, they guard against making it their sole foundation.\nIf they rely upon clarity and responsiveness, tranquility and fullness,\nthen they will surely fear collapse and eruption, extinction and depletion.\nAlas! All things rely upon their *principle of life*—\nif they rely upon it, the *Heavenly Principle* (天理) will surely perish.\nRulers rely upon steadfastness—\nif they rely upon it, their *nobility and elevation* (貴高) will surely falter.\nThe words *\"nobility and elevation\"* are added to warn of the profound intent for rulers.\n\nThey have both warned and expounded upon it, saying:\n*\"The reason rulers attain nobility and kingship is because they take the lowly as their root,\nthe reason they occupy high positions is because they take the common people as their foundation.\nAs for calling themselves Lone, Few, and Not Grains—\nthese are terms of lowliness,\nyet rulers who use them to describe themselves\nare truly taking lowliness as their root.\"*\n\nTo exhaust its meaning, how shall we explain it?\nThe *scholar* (士), *farmer* (农), *artisan* (工), and *merchant* (商) all exist within the people—\nonly then does the state exist.\nThe *wheels* (輪), *axles* (辕), *chests* (箱), and *shafts* (轴) are prepared for use—\nonly then does the carriage exist.\nNow, if one points to the carriage and counts its parts,\nthey are but wheels, axles, chests, and shafts—\none does not see the carriage itself.\nIf one points to the state and counts its elements,\nthey are but scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants—\none does not see the state itself.\nThus, the scholar, farmer, artisan, and merchant\nare the lowly and base of the state—\nthe state’s existence depends upon the lowly and base as its root.\nHence, rulers should warn themselves against nobility,\nnot desiring the brilliance of jade-like splendor,\nbut should take the lowly and base as their root—\nthus, they should be like flint-like stone in their common humility.\n\nThe *Classical* says:\n*\"The contrary is the movement of the Dao/Way,\nthe weak is its application.*\nAll things under Heaven arise from *Being* (有),\n*Being* arises from *Non-Being* (无).\"\nThe *Commentary* says:\n*\"The *power* (权) is that which, through contrariness, moves and aligns with the proper.\nThe *substance* (实) is that which, through weakness, applies and is governed by the strong.*\nAll things under Heaven arise from *having form* (有形),\n*having form* must arise from *having no form* (无形).\nAll affairs under Heaven arise from *having signs* (有兆),\n*having signs* must arise from *having no signs* (无兆).\nThus, knowing that contrariness is movement,\nit must arise from weakness as application—\nthen the subtle beginning of motion\nmust arise from the principle of stillness and obscurity.\nYet, the subtle beginning of motion arises from principle,\nand in the end, it returns to principle.\nPower arises from substance,\nand in the end, it returns to substance—\nthese are all the *universal transformations* (通变) of the Dao/Way,\nthe *reversals and recoveries* (覆却) that mutually aid each other.\n\nThe *Classical* says:\n*\"The superior person hears the Dao/Way and diligently practices it;\nthe middle person hears the Dao/Way and clings to it uncertainly;\nthe inferior person hears the Dao/Way and laughs at it—\nif they do not laugh, it is not the Dao/Way.\"*\n\nThe *Commentary* builds upon this:\n*\"The Dao/Way, though clear, is as if obscured;\nadvancing the Dao/Way is as if retreating;\nleveling the Dao/Way is as if crooked;\nsuperior virtue is as if lacking;\ngreat brightness is as if stained;\nexpansive virtue is as if insufficient;\nestablished virtue is as if stolen;\npure truth is as if muddy;\nthe greatest square has no corners;\nthe greatest vessel takes long to form;\nthe greatest sound is faint;\nthe greatest form is shapeless;\nthe Dao/Way is hidden and nameless.\"*\n\nThe Dao/Way alone is good at lending and completing.\nThe *Commentary* says:\nThe *Book of Changes* (《易》) states:\n*\"That which is above form is called the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way is that which transcends form.\nThat which is below form is called the vessel.\nThe vessel is that which is confined within form.*\nThe superior person knows the subtle and the manifest,\ntranscends form, and thus hears the Dao/Way and believes it—\nthey diligently practice it.\nThe middle person is caught between the subtle and the manifest,\ndwelling in the space between the Dao/Way and the vessel—\nthus, when they hear the Dao/Way, they doubt and half-believe—\nhence, they cling to it uncertainly.\nThe inferior person knows only the manifest and not the subtle,\nis confined within form—\nthus, when they hear the Dao/Way, they laugh at it.\nNot only do they laugh,\nbut they would also deny it.\nThe Dao/Way is subtle, mysterious, and profoundly penetrating,\ndeep beyond recognition—\nif it were not laughed at and denied by the inferior,\nthen it would not be the true and refined Dao/Way.\nYet, why is it laughed at and denied by the inferior?\nIt is because the *Commentary* says:\n\n*\"The one who embodies the Dao/Way,\naligns with the Heavenly Principle of the sun and moon in their steadfast clarity,\nyet their light does not dazzle—\nthis is the Dao/Way, though clear, as if obscured.\nThey align with the Heavenly Principle of Heaven and Earth in their ease and simplicity,\nyet their application cannot be made into laws and decrees—\nthis is the Dao/Way, though level, as if crooked.\nThey align with the Heavenly Principle of the four seasons in their movement,\nyet their action must return to the mysterious and profound—\nthis is advancing the Dao/Way as if retreating.\nThey constantly dwell in lowliness,\nyet are never corrupted—\nthis is superior virtue as if lacking.\nThey constantly reside in filth and impurity,\nyet are never stained—\nthis is great brightness as if stained.\nThey clothe and shelter all under Heaven,\nyet do not claim credit for their kindness—\nthis is expansive virtue as if insufficient.\nThey nurture and sustain all things,\nyet do not display their efforts—\nthis is established virtue as if stolen.\nThey restore their nature to govern their emotions—\nthis is pure truth as if muddy.\nThey are correct within and act properly without—\nthis is the greatest square having no corners.\nWith the skill of a clumsy artisan,\nthey mold and refine all under Heaven yet do not seek immediate results—\nthis is the greatest vessel taking long to form.\nWith teaching that is not spoken,\nthey stir and move all things yet do not indulge in trifling words—\nthis is the greatest sound being faint.\nIn affairs where there is no affair,\none does not see their use—\nthis is the greatest form being shapeless.\nIn doing that which is *Non-Doing* (无为),\none does not recognize their body—\nthis is the Dao/Way being hidden and nameless.\n\nThe Dao/Way alone is good at lending and completing to all things,\nyet does not demand repayment—\nthus, all things receive its nurturing and completion yet do not know its virtue,\nand so the inferior person hears this Dao/Way and laughs at it,\nnot believing it could be so.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Scripture:**\nThe Dao/Way gives birth to One,\nOne gives birth to Two,\nTwo gives birth to Three,\nThree gives birth to all things.\nAll things bear yin and embrace yang,\nand through the interplay of *qi* achieve harmony.\n\nWhat people detest—\nthe titles *Orphan, Widow, and Without Grain*—\nyet kings and lords claim them as their own.\nThus, some things are diminished to be enhanced,\nwhile others are enhanced to be diminished.\n\nWhat people teach as *benefit*,\nI teach as *subduing*—\nthe violent and domineering shall not meet their end,\nand I shall make them my teacher.\n\nThe most yielding in all under Heaven\novercomes the most rigid in all under Heaven.\nThere is no entry into the unspanned.\n\nThus, I know the virtue of *Non-Doing*.\n\nThe teaching of *Non-Speaking*,\nthe benefit of *Non-Doing*—\nfew under Heaven attain it.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe essence of true *qi* generates the wondrous functions of all things.\nWhen the form of *qi* is complete, all things arise.\nYin and yang intermingle to form the harmonizing *qi*,\nand this harmonizing *qi* circulates and transforms to produce all things.\n\nYet when all things are born,\nthey inevitably turn their backs to yin and face yang,\nwith harmonizing *qi* coursing between them—\nthis is how their natural order is maintained.\n\nThe Sage establishes teaching by tracing the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth,\nand exhausting the principles of all things,\nand thus knows that human life too is governed by harmonizing *qi*.\n\nHow may this be made clear?\nHumans receive the central *qi* of Heaven and Earth at birth—\nthis is called *fate*.\nAt its beginning, there is a luminous vitality, called *hun* and *po*.\nThe *po* is yin,\nthe *hun* is yang.\nWhen yin and yang blend in purity,\nharmonizing *qi* flows between them,\nand thus the form and spirit are perfected.\n\nIf harmonizing *qi* is preserved whole,\nspirit and form are in accord,\nand spirit and form in accord mean life.\nIf harmonizing *qi* is scattered,\nspirit and form separate,\nand spirit and form separated mean death.\n\nThe dead cannot be revived,\nthe scattered cannot be restored—\nthus, one must nurture the vast harmonizing *qi*\nto align with the Dao/Way of Nature.\n\nDoes not the *Classic of Changes* say:\n*The greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth is generation.*\nGeneration is what the Sage holds most precious.\nThe Sage values life so highly\nbecause through it the Dao/Way is realized.\n\nThe Dao/Way is what the world reveres—\nthough it encompasses Heaven and Earth,\nand penetrates the finest hairs,\nits essence lies in body and mind alone.\n\nThus, those who follow the Dao/Way cultivate the vital principles of body and mind,\nand the key to this lies in dwelling where people detest.\n\nNow, *Orphan, Widow, and Without Grain*—\nthese are what people detest,\nyet kings and lords claim them as their own,\nfor they seek to diminish the violent and domineering\nand benefit from virtue and power.\n\nIn the *Classic of Changes*, *Diminishing* is a virtue,\nand none excel it more than restraining anger and suppressing desire.\nTo restrain anger and suppress desire\nis to clarify the mind daily,\nand a clarified mind can benefit from principle.\n\nThe finest enhancement is to change what is bad and amend what is wrong.\nTo change what is bad and amend what is wrong\nis to rectify the body daily,\nand a rectified body can diminish its affairs.\n\nThis is what is meant by:\n*Some things are diminished to be enhanced,\nothers enhanced to be diminished.*\n\nPeople’s teaching is to increase daily,\nbut I teach to diminish daily.\nThus, diminish again and again,\nuntil one reaches *Non-Doing*.\n\nThe Dao/Way employs softness and weakness in action,\ndoes not contend with things,\nand thus nothing can contend with it—\nthis is the *Non-Diminishing, Non-Enhancing*.\n\nThe violent and domineering harm things violently,\nand things harm them in return,\nso they cannot fulfill their natural order—\nthis is the *Not-Enhanced, but Struck*.\n\nI know that the violent and domineering are detested by all things,\nso I take this softness and weakness as the parent of all teachings.\n\nHow may this be made clear?\nWater, though supremely yielding in use,\nerodes the most rigid stone.\n*Qi*, though formless in essence,\npenetrates the unspanned in all things.\n\nThus, I see water attacking the most rigid,\nand *qi* entering the unspanned,\nand so I know the benefit of *Non-Doing*\nand the harm of *Doing*.\n\nTo practice the teaching of much speech,\nto be entangled in *Doing*—\nthis is the harm of *Doing*.\n\nTo practice the teaching of *Non-Speaking*,\nto embody the principle of *Non-Doing*—\nthis is the benefit of *Non-Doing*.\n\nThe teaching of much speech brings the harm of *Doing*—\nall under Heaven are thus.\nThe teaching of *Non-Speaking* brings the benefit of *Non-Doing*—\nyet few under Heaven attain it.\n\nAh! Those who truly know me are rare,\nso I am held in trustworthy esteem.\n\n**Scripture:**\nWhich is closer to me—*name* or *body*?\nWhich is more abundant—*body* or *wealth*?\nWhich brings greater harm—*gain* or *loss*?\n\nThus, the more one loves excessively,\nthe greater the expenditure.\nThe more one hoards,\nthe greater the loss.\n\nTo know sufficiency is to avoid disgrace,\nto know cessation is to avoid peril—\nthus one may endure long.\n\n**Commentary:**\n*Name* is the banner of one’s standing.\nIf it is genuine, the body is honored in its time,\nand the name endures in posterity.\nBut if it is contrived and exaggerated,\nunworthy of reality,\nthough the name may be heard by others,\nthe body will be abandoned by those of the Dao.\n\n*Wealth* is the resource for one’s livelihood.\nIf used properly, the body is esteemed for generous giving,\nand wealth is not hoarded for oneself.\nBut if acquired through greed and deceit,\nand not dispersed in benevolence and kindness,\nthough wealth may fill the halls,\nthe body will be slighted by those of virtue.\n\nTo lose both the censure of usurping names and squandering wealth,\nwhile neglecting the way of cultivating oneself and restraining desires—\nwhich of these brings greater harm?\n\nThus, those who love *name* excessively\ngive rise to deceit,\nand thus greatly damage reality.\nThose who hoard wealth excessively\ninvite thieves,\nand thus greatly lose their resources.\n\nTo know sufficiency is to not covet wealth,\nto know cessation is to not covet *name*.\nNot coveting wealth avoids disgrace,\nnot coveting *name* avoids peril.\n\nOnly thus can one’s *name* endure,\nand one’s wealth be long preserved.\n\n**经:**\nThe greatest fullness appears as if incomplete—\nits use is inexhaustible.\nThe greatest abundance seems empty—\nits use is boundless.\nThe most upright seems bent,\nthe most skillful seems clumsy,\nthe most eloquent seems tongue-tied.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold,\nstillness overcomes heat—\nthus, clarity and tranquility are the Way’s foundation for all under Heaven.\n\n**传:**\nThe Sage’s Dao nourishes all under Heaven,\nyet fears even one thing left unplaced—\nthus, all affairs are accomplished without exhaustion.\nVirtue fills the four seas,\nyet does not dare to swell with self-conceit—\nthus, all affairs are managed without depletion.\n\nWalking the Way of utmost ease yet never straying,\nrelying on self-perfected instruments without carving,\nlaying out the most fitting principles without embellishment—\nthus, things follow their nature,\npeople fulfill their capacities,\nand the world’s affairs settle without effort.\n\nExamine why this is so—\nit is simply the power of spontaneity.\nLike agitation overcoming bitter cold,\nstillness overcoming scorching heat—\nnot by contriving cold or heat,\nyet cold and heat cannot assail it.\n\nThus, without action, the people transform themselves;\nwithout preference for stillness, the people align themselves.\nAll movement under Heaven originates from One—\nthus, clarity and tranquility can govern all under Heaven.\n\n**经:**\nWhen the Way prevails in the world,\nwarhorses are driven out to manure fields.\nWhen the Way is lost in the world,\nwarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo guilt is greater than craving what is improper,\nno calamity is greater than insatiability,\nno fault is graver than demanding possession.\nThus, the sufficiency of sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\n**传:**\nIn an age where the Way prevails,\nthe Son of Heaven guards against the four barbarians,\nthe feudal lords guard against neighboring states—\nthough arms and steeds exist, they serve no purpose.\nThe people follow their teachings,\nreturn to farming and sericulture,\nclear the wilds to plant trees,\nmanure the fields and sow seeds—\nthus, the people cherish their land\nand strengthen their kinship.\n\nWhen the Way is lost,\nthe Son of Heaven repels the four barbarians,\nthe feudal lords invade neighboring states—\nthus, arms stir within the borders,\nwarhorses gallop through the suburbs.\nThe people weary from labor,\nabandon their livelihoods,\nmulberry groves turn to firewood,\nbriers and thorns grow in the fields—\nthe people flee their homelands and betray their lords.\n\nAlas, the tyranny of the Wayless ruler poisons all under Heaven.\nTrace its origin—three evils of the heart:\nSeeking what is improper yet unjust—\nthus, no guilt is greater.\nSeeking without restraint harms others—\nthus, no calamity is greater.\nDemanding possession only inflames the heart—\nthus, no fault is heavier.\n\nYet, only the Sage can be without desire.\nDesire leads to seeking,\nseeking without sufficiency brings the greatest calamity.\nAlas, none have ever sought much and gained much—\nthus, those who seek with sufficiency\nseek little and thus supply easily,\nand their seeking is ever sufficient.\n\n**经:**\nWithout stepping outside,\none knows all under Heaven.\nWithout peering through windows,\none perceives the Way of Heaven.\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.\nThus, the Sage acts without moving,\nnames without seeing,\naccomplishes without doing.\n\n**传:**\nThe Sage’s governance\nextends from self and heart to all under Heaven—\nthus, when eating, think of the world’s hunger;\nwhen clothing, think of the world’s cold;\nlove for one’s parents extends to the world’s aged;\nlove for one’s children extends to the world’s young.\nThus, without leaving home,\none knows all under Heaven.\n\nThe Sage’s governance\nreturns to self and heart to align with Heaven’s Way—\nthus, delighting in life reveals Heaven’s nurturing of all things,\ncompleting tasks reveals Heaven’s perfecting of the four seasons,\nfavoring goodness reveals Heaven’s favor toward the virtuous.\nHeaven displays its symbols to manifest its Way,\nthe Sage aligns self and heart with the Way—\nwhy gaze through windows to perceive Heaven’s Way?\n\nThose who cannot reflect inward,\nyet clamorously take all under Heaven as their burden,\nexhaust their spirit,\ntorment their form,\ntoiling ceaselessly in worldly affairs—\nI see they cannot govern.\n\nWhy? The world’s affairs are myriad daily,\nyet if they grasp not the essentials,\nfixate on trifles,\ntheir form and spirit grow weary.\nWhen the spirit is overtaxed, it is depleted;\nwhen the form is overtaxed, it is worn;\nwhen both are overtaxed, peril follows.\nLaboring in trivialities yet never attaining even a fraction—\nthus, the farther they go, the less they know.\n\nHence the *Record* says:\nTo govern the world, first govern one’s state;\nto govern one’s state, first govern one’s family;\nto govern one’s family, first govern oneself;\nto govern oneself, first govern one’s heart;\nto govern one’s heart, first rectify one’s intentions.\nThus, the noble one without sincerity achieves nothing—\nall must return to self and heart.\n\nWithout traversing the world yet knowing human nature,\nwithout observing celestial omens yet naming Heaven’s Way—\nwithout toiling in affairs yet achieving perfect governance—\nthis is the power of reflecting on self and heart.\n\nConfucius said:\nOnly Heaven is vast—\nonly Yao followed it.\nHe also said:\nTo govern without action—\nwas it not Shun?\n\nThis is what is meant.\n\n**经:**\nFor learning, daily increase;\nfor the Dao, daily decrease.\nDecrease again, decrease again,\nuntil reaching non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing remains undone.\nTaking the world with non-interference,\nwhen interference arises,\nit is insufficient to take the world.\n\n**传:**\nThe scholar broadens knowledge and accumulates insight\nto grasp principles—\nthus, daily increase.\nThe Daoist holds fast to the essentials,\nsimplifies affairs—\nthus, daily decrease.\n\nWhen principles are clear, affairs settle—\nthus, the scholar’s daily increase\nrelies on the Daoist’s daily decrease.\n\nTo calm turbulent governance,\nstillness can gradually clarify—\nthus, decrease is gradual,\nnot to be removed abruptly—\nhence, decrease again, decrease again.\n\n「。\n　　**Experience:** Resting in flawed customs, movement can gradually bring forth change—\nthus, decrease until reaching non-action,\nand then one can achieve nothing left undone.\n\n　　**The Way of the Sage:**\nThe one who acts relies on human inclinations to establish laws and regulations,\nso there is interference.\nInterference exhausts the people,\nand exhaustion leads to rebellion.\nThe one who does not act follows the natural inclinations of things,\nsupporting their inherent spontaneity,\nso there is no interference.\nNo interference brings ease to the people,\nand ease leads them to return willingly.\n\n　　The Sage’s mind ever considers\none thing out of place—\nto address flaws and chaos,\nthe key lies in winning the hearts of the people.\nWinning the hearts of the people\nmeans letting them come willingly of their own accord.\nThus, through non-action, no interference,\nand customs transformed into clarity and stillness,\nthe people take delight in being guided\nwithout ever growing weary.\n\n　　If there is action and interference,\ngovernment becomes burdensome and the people weary,\nthen the populace will recoil in fear\nand thus it is insufficient to win the hearts of the people.\n\n　　**Experience:** The Sage has no fixed heart,\nbut takes the hearts of the people as their own.\nIf they are virtuous, I nurture their virtue;\nif they are not virtuous, I also nurture them with virtue—\nthus, virtue is attained.\nIf they are trustworthy, I trust them;\nif they are not trustworthy, I also trust them—\nthus, trust is attained.\n\n　　The Sage moves through the world in humble reverence,\nunifying the hearts of the people,\nwhile all the people focus their ears and eyes on the Sage,\nas if the Sage were their tender child.\n　　**Transmission:** The Sage embodies the Dao and does nothing,\nresponding only to the stirrings of things—\nresponding to what is stirred,\nthus having no fixed heart.\n\n　　Yet the hearts of the people\never seek to secure their lives\nand fulfill their nature.\nThe Sage ever ensures that each person\nreceives what they desire—\nis this not taking the hearts of the people as their own?\n\n　　If the people have a heart for virtue,\nthe Sage also responds with virtue to nurture them—\nthose inherently virtuous,\nI assist with virtue to reinforce their goodness.\nIf the people have a heart for non-virtue,\nI also treat them with virtue,\nso that they feel my goodness\nand transform, becoming virtuous—\nthen the world has no one who is not virtuous,\nand the people all attain the virtue they desire.\n\n　　As for the people who have a heart for trust,\nI also transform them with this,\nso that the people all attain the trust they desire,\nand the world has no one who is untrustworthy.\n\n　　Thus, the Sage moves through the world,\nhumble and responsive to the stirrings of things,\nnever resting,\nyet their heart is unified with the world,\nnever acting for themselves.\n\n　　Hence, Confucius’ four prohibitions:\nDo not impose your will,\ndo not be rigid,\ndo not be obstinate,\ndo not be self-centered.\nThus, they can have no preferences,\nno fixed course of action,\nno interference,\nno non-action—\nso the people focus their ears and eyes on the Sage,\nas a babe gazes upon its loving mother,\nand the Sage fears only that they might be harmed.\n\n　　**Experience:** Born to life, born to death.\nThose born to life are thirteen in ten,\nthose born to death are thirteen in ten,\nand those born to life,\nwhen moved, also die thirteen in ten.\nWhy so?\nBecause the abundance of life’s vitality\nleads to death’s domain.»\n\nThe cover of the *Daoist Classic of Vitality* states:\n\n*\"The adept at preserving life*\nwalks upon land without fearing rhinoceros or tiger,\nenters battle without shunning armor and weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to hurl its horn,\nthe tiger finds no place to strike with its claws,\nthe weapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy so?\nBecause there are no grounds for death within them.\n\n**Scripture:** Life must inevitably meet death—\nthis is the natural order.\nTo grasp the order of life and death,\none must accept it as constant.\n\nIf one defies this order,\nthey stray beyond the bounds of vitality.\nStraying beyond the bounds of vitality,\nthey must inevitably fall into death’s domain.\nYet even so, those who know life’s order\nand do not defy it to preserve their own—\nthree in ten.\nThose who know death’s order\nand do not defy it to avoid death—\nthree in ten as well.\nBut if they love life and defy the order to preserve it,\nthey lose it instead;\nif they hate death and defy the order to avoid it,\nthey gain it instead—\nthe same holds true.\nHow does this come about?\nBecause the pursuit of life’s excess\ntransgresses beyond its natural bounds,\nand thus, when moved from constancy,\nthey are drawn into death’s domain.\n\nHence, the adept at preserving life is different:\nknowing life’s order, they uphold the *Dao* and embrace *virtue*\nwithout indulging in life’s excess;\nknowing death’s order, they find joy in *Heaven’s* ways\nand accept their *fate* without fearing death.\nLife and death cannot sway their heart,\ncalamities cannot shake their resolve,\nso they walk upon land and meet fierce beasts\nwithout alarm,\nenter battle and brave the sharp blades\nwithout flinching—\nthough facing hardship and misfortune alike.\nHow do they achieve this?\nIf one harms with their heart,\nthings will harm them in return;\nif one trusts with their sincerity,\nthings will trust them in return.\nI do not harm with my heart,\nso rhinoceros and tiger find no place to strike with claws or horns;\nI trust with my sincerity,\nso armor and weapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nThus, when life’s order does not dwell within,\ndeath’s domain does not appear before.\n\n*The Master Zhongni* said:\n‘*Loyalty* and *trustworthiness* make even fire and water passable.’\nThis is indeed close to the truth.\n\n**Scripture:** The *Dao* gives birth to them,\n*virtue* nurtures them,\nthings shape their form,\nand *power* completes their function.\nThus, all things revere the *Dao* and honor *virtue*.\nThe *Dao’s* reverence,\nthe *virtue’s* honor—\nnone bestow them upon it,\nyet they arise naturally and everlastingly.\n\nTherefore, the *Dao* gives birth and nurtures,\nlengthens and matures,\nshelters and poisons,\nrears and protects.\nIt gives birth without possession,\nacts without reliance,\nlengthens without control—\nthis is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\n\n**Scripture:** Things are born and then nurtured,\nnurtured and then shaped,\nshaped and then completed.\nThat which gives birth to them is the *Dao*;\nthat which nurtures them is *virtue*;\nthat which shapes their forms is *affairs*;\nthat which completes their function is *power*.\nAll things honor the *Dao* because it gives birth,\nand they revere *virtue* because it nurtures.\nThe *Dao* and *virtue* give birth and nurture,\nso they are naturally revered by all things—\nhow could they be honored only after titles and ranks are conferred?\n\nYet the *Dao* is the essence of the true subtlety,\nand *virtue* is the function of the wondrous.\nThe essence can encompass the function,\nbut the function cannot encompass the essence.\nThe *Dao* can encompass *virtue*,\nbut *virtue* cannot encompass the *Dao*.\nThus, receiving its essence is called *birth*,\nembracing its *qi* is called *nurture*,\nfulfilling its form is called *lengthening*,\nmarking its substance is called *maturing*,\nbalancing its completion is called *sheltering*,\nmeasuring its function is called *poisoning*,\npreserving its harmony is called *rearing*,\nguarding its injury is called *protecting*—\nthis is called the *Great Dao*.\nHaving given birth without clinging to possession,\nhaving acted without boasting of reliance,\nhaving lengthened without controlling—\nthis is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\n\nThe *Chapter of Vital Essence* speaks of how humans align with *Dao* and *virtue*,\nwhile this chapter speaks of how *Dao* and *virtue* align with humans,\nthus their words are similar yet their meaning is unified.\n\n**Scripture:** The world has a beginning,\nwhich we call the *Mother of the World*.\nHaving obtained this *Mother*,\none knows her offspring.\nHaving known the offspring,\none returns to guard the *Mother*—\nthus, one’s body remains unharmed through life’s end.\n\n**Scripture:** The world’s myriad things indeed have a beginning,\nand the beginning of all things—\nis it not the *Nameless*?\nAll things indeed have a source,\nand the source that gives birth to all—\nis it not the *Named*?\nThus, the *Nameless* is the world’s beginning,\nand the *Named* is all things’ *Mother*.\nThe *Nameless* and the *Named* exist in essence and function,\nfor function arises from essence,\nso the *Nameless* is also the *Mother* of the *Named*.\n\nTherefore, it is said:\n‘The world has a beginning,\nwhich we call the *Mother of the World*’—\nthis is the *Dao* giving birth to One.\nOne is the *Dao’s* offspring,\nthe *Dao* is One’s *Mother*.\nThe *Dao* refers to the essence of true subtlety,\nand One refers to the function of wondrous things.\nHaving obtained its essence,\none knows its function.\nHaving obtained its function,\none returns to guard its essence.\nWhen essence and function merge as One,\nresponding to stimuli without end,\nthen one can govern without action—\nthus, one’s body remains unharmed through life’s end.\n\n**Scripture:** Seal its *mouth* (兑),\nshut its *path*,\nand one will never tire through life’s end.\nOpen its *mouth*,\ncomplete its *affairs*,\nand one will never be saved through life’s end.\nSeeing what is small is called *clarity*,\nguarding what is soft is called *strength*.\nUsing its *light*,\nthen returning to its *clarity*—\nleaving no harm to one’s body,\nthis is called *following the constant*.\n\n**Scripture:** The *mouth* is where desires take root.\nThe *path* is where actions arise.\nWith nature rectifying emotions,\nthe source of desires is sealed;\nwith principle governing affairs,\nthe path of actions is closed.\nThus, one can act without doing,\nand do without acting—\nso one never tires through life’s end.\n\nOpening the source without sealing it,\none lengthens the desires of the emotions;\nunblocking the path without closing it,\none completes the affairs of actions.\nThus, form and spirit both labor,\nand one will never be saved through life’s end.\n\nKnowing the art of sealing the *mouth* and closing the *path*,\nthis is called seeing the *minute* and *small*;\ndulling the sharpness of desires,\ndissolving the confusion of actions—\nthis is called guarding the *soft* and *weak*.\nGuarding the *soft* and *weak*,\nthings cannot overpower one—\nthis is called *strength*.\nSeeing the *minute* and *small*,\naffairs cannot be muddled—\nthis is called *clarity*.\n*Clarity* refers to inner vision (essence),\nand *light* refers to outward radiance (function).\"\n\nOutwardly responding to affairs,\ninwardly returning to the Way—\nthus function returns to essence,\nand one says: *\"Use its light,\nthen restore its clarity.\"*\n\nBy returning function to essence,\none aligns with the Dao.\nThe Dao employs softness and weakness,\nand desires do not arise—\nthus one may roam through actions,\nyet never be harmed by all things.\n\nIf desires are not eliminated,\none forces oneself upon affairs;\nwhen affairs grow troublesome,\nthey harm the Way—\nthis is self-inflicted calamity.\n\nThus, to use seeing the *minute* and guarding the *soft*\nis to employ the hidden and the eternal.\n\n**Sutra:**\n*\"Let me be resolutely aware,\nwalking the Great Dao,\nand only fear what is proper.\"*\n\nThe Great Dao is most level,\nyet people prefer shortcuts.\nPalaces are grandly cleared,\nfields lie fallow,\ngranaries stand empty.\nGarments are richly adorned,\nbelts hold sharp blades,\nfeasts are gluttonous,\nwealth overflows—\nthis is called *robber’s vanity*.\nIt is not the Dao.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe Master Lao said,\n*\"If I were recklessly ignorant,\nseeking only to conform to the age,\nI would merely strive to fit in.\nBut if I am resolutely aware of constant clarity,\nwalking the Great Dao,\nI would only fear what strays from it.\"*\n\nThe Great Dao is like a broad thoroughfare—\nlevel and easy, reaching everywhere,\nits great straightness fears no small detours.\nYet people, desiring speed,\ntake winding paths,\nlost in confusion,\nnever reaching their goal.\n\nThus the Sage laments this,\ncarefully guiding teachings,\nfearing to lead people astray,\nlest they never align with the Great Dao.\n\nAlas, enter a land,\nand its governance is known:\nIf palace gates are grandly cleared,\nwalls and halls finely carved,\nits ruler delights in construction,\nseeking frivolous pleasures.\nIf fields lie barren,\nits ruler loves forced labor,\nstealing the people’s time.\nIf granaries stand empty,\nits ruler favors frivolous pursuits,\nneglecting the roots of livelihood.\nIf garments are richly adorned,\nits ruler loves licentious craftsmanship,\nexhausting artisans.\nIf belts hold sharp blades,\nits ruler loves martial prowess,\nbringing strife to the land.\nIf feasts are gluttonous,\nits ruler loves drunkenness,\nforgetting the people’s needs.\nIf wealth overflows,\nits ruler loves taxation,\nimpoverishing the people.\n\nAll these are *robber’s vanity*—\nstealing the people’s strength for empty display.\nThus it is called *robber’s vanity*.\n*Robber’s vanity* is not the governance of the Dao.\n\nYet stealing takes place in secret,\nand the people remain unaware.\n*\"Only proper action is to be feared\"*—\nis this not so?\n\n**Sutra:**\nThe well-built cannot be uprooted,\nthe well-embraced cannot slip away—\nancestors’ sacrifices never cease.\nCultivate the self,\nand virtue becomes genuine;\ncultivate the family,\nand virtue overflows;\ncultivate the village,\nand virtue endures;\ncultivate the state,\nand virtue flourishes;\ncultivate the world,\nand virtue is universal.\n\nThus, observe the self with the self,\nthe family with the family,\nthe village with the village,\nthe state with the state,\nthe world with the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe well-built grounds the state’s foundation in the Dao,\ndeep-rooted and unshakable.\nThe well-embraced holds the people’s hearts with virtue,\nunbinding and unbreakable.\nThus descendants enjoy long prosperity,\nand ancestral sacrifices never fail.\n\nCultivate the Dao in the self,\nand virtue is pure and true.\nCultivate the Dao in the family,\nand virtue is abundant.\nCultivate the Dao in the village,\nand virtue endures long.\nCultivate the Dao in the state,\nand virtue is vast and grand.\nCultivate the Dao in the world,\nand virtue spreads universally.\n\nThus, reflect on the self with the Dao of self-cultivation—\nif the self aligns with the Dao,\nvirtue is genuine.\nReflect on the family with the Dao of family governance—\nif family members harmonize with kin,\nvirtue overflows.\nReflect on the village with the Dao of village order—\nif neighbors trust one another,\nvirtue endures.\nReflect on the state with the Dao of statecraft—\nif the people thrive,\nvirtue flourishes.\nReflect on the world with the Dao of universal governance—\nif all desire ceases,\nvirtue is universal.\n\nHow do I know the world, states, and even self and heart are thus?\nBy this reflection alone.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Observe my birth—observe the people.\"*\nIs this not the meaning?\n\n**Sutra:**\nThe depth of virtue compares to an infant.\nPoisonous creatures do not sting,\nferocious beasts do not seize,\ngrasping birds do not strike.\nBones are weak, sinews soft, yet grip is firm;\nunaware of male and female union, yet virility arises—\nthis is the peak of *essence*.\nAll day it cries yet never hoarse—\nthis is the peak of *harmony*.\nKnowing harmony is constancy,\nknowing constancy is clarity,\nincreasing life is auspicious,\nthe heart directing *qi* is strength.\nWhen things grow robust, they age—\nthis is called *not the Dao*.\n*Not the Dao* brings early decay.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe Sage’s virtue is divine—\nhow else could it be thus?\n\nThe infant’s nature is pure and thick,\ndesires nonexistent,\ntranquil and unformed.\nThe infant harms no thing,\nnor does any thing harm it—\nbees, wasps, serpents pass without sting,\ngrasping birds and fierce beasts encounter it without attack.\nThough sinews and bones are frail,\nits grasp is unyielding;\nthough desires are unborn,\nits vigor is natural;\nthough it cries all day,\nits voice is smooth and unstrained—\nall from undispersed *essence*,\never-present *harmony*.\n\nThus the Sage follows the infant’s softness and harmony,\nmaking it the constant virtue.\nKnowing harmony and softness as constant virtue,\nand applying it,\nis the heart’s clarity.\n\nThe birth of life is the Way’s great principle;\nto follow this principle is the first of blessings.\nIf one thickens life and adds to blessings,\none has strayed from the Way’s principle—\ndisaster will surely follow.\nThus, to nourish life is called *auspicious*.\n\nThe will moves *qi*, and *qi* moves the will;\nwhen the heart entrusts itself to *qi*,\n*qi* flourishes and the heart grows strong—\nthis is called *strength*.\n\nAll things in their vigor must grow old,\nand a strong heart must grow violent.\nThe Dao uses softness and weakness—\nthus, strength and vigor are called *not the Dao*.\nKnowing this *not the Dao*, one may cease early.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"Not distant, return—*\n*no regret remains.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nThe *Scripture* says:\n*\"The wise do not speak,*\n*those who speak are not wise.\"*\nClose the *ui* (mouth),\nshut the gate,\nblunt the sharp,\nuntangle the tangled,\nharmonize the bright,\nalign with the dust—\nthis is called *mystic unity*.\n\nThus, one cannot be too close,\nnor too distant.\nCannot be exploited,\nnor harmed.\nCannot be honored,\nnor debased.\nThus, one is noble in the world.\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\nThose who know the Dao act with the heart, not with argument;\nthose who discuss the Dao use argument, not the heart.\nThus, the great man abandons these arguments,\ntakes this heart-awakening,\nblocks the roots of cravings,\nshuts the path of false pretenses,\nblunts the edge of worldly passions,\nuntangles the knots of worldly schemes,\nabove harmonizes the radiance without glare,\nbelow aligns with the dust without obscurity—\nthis is called *subtle, mysterious, and all-pervasive*,\nin great harmony with all things.\n\nIn high company, he does not flatter—\nthus, he cannot be too familiar.\nIn low company, he does not degrade—\nthus, he cannot be too distant.\nModest and yielding, he does not contend—\nthus, he cannot be exploited or harmed.\nIn high station, he does not weigh heavily—\nthus, he cannot be overly honored.\nIn low station, he does not soil himself—\nthus, he cannot be debased.\nHis virtue and power are self-noble,\nnot made so by others—\nthis is why he is the world’s supreme nobility.\n\nThe *Scripture* says:\n*\"Rule with rectitude, act with the unexpected,*\n*conquer the world with non-action.\"*\nHow do I know this is so?\n\nWhen the world is filled with taboos,\nthe people grow poorer.\nWhen the people have many tools,\nthe state grows corrupt.\nWhen the people are clever,\nwicked deeds multiply.\nWhen laws proliferate,\nthieves abound.\nThus, the Sage says:\n*\"I act with non-action, and the people transform themselves;\nI do nothing, and the people grow rich;\nI love stillness, and the people become upright;\nI desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"To name correctly is to avoid excess—\nthis can govern the state.\"*\n*\"To use the unexpected is to avoid exhaustion—\nthis can employ the army.\"*\nThese two talents suffice to remedy disasters,\nbut they are not enduring or grand.\nWhat endures and is grand\nis nothing more than winning the world’s heart.\nTo truly win the world’s heart,\nnothing surpasses *non-action*—\nonce action begins,\nit is no longer sufficient to win the world’s heart.\nHow do I know this is so?\n\nWhen the world has affairs,\ntaboos and prohibitions multiply,\nintended to govern the people.\nThe people, seeing these affairs,\ncannot settle into their work—\nthus, they grow poorer.\nWhen the people have desires,\ntools and instruments multiply,\nintended to aid the state.\nYet the state, with its desires,\ncannot maintain stillness in governance—\nthus, it grows corrupt.\nWhen the people are clever,\nthis is to prevent deceit—\nyet deceit grows more cunning—\nthus, wicked deeds multiply.\nWhen laws proliferate,\nthis is to prevent crime—\nyet criminals find more ways—\nthus, thieves abound.\nAll these are attempts to dam the flow\nwithout blocking the source—\nthus, the harm grows worse and cannot be stopped.\n\nSince action cannot win the world’s heart,\nit is known that only *non-action* can.\nThus, the Master of Lao cites the Sage’s words,\nnot daring to claim them as his own—\nhis cited words are from the *Three Containers*.\nThe Master of Lao, as Keeper of Records beneath the Zhou pillars,\nsurveyed the remnants of ancient texts,\nthus citing them to confirm their necessity.\n\nThe *Transmission*’s preface says:\n*\"He wove together the teachings of the Yellow Emperor.\"*\nThis is of the same kind.\n\nIf I act with non-action,\nthe people follow their nature—\nthus, their customs transform themselves.\nIf I do nothing,\nthe people return to their work—\nthus, their households grow rich.\nIf I love stillness,\nthe people preserve their true nature—\nthus, their affairs become upright.\nIf I desire nothing,\nthe people abandon pretension—\nthus, their nature returns to simplicity.\nIf one has affairs and desires,\nyet hopes to bring the people to wealth and longevity,\nI have never seen it possible.\n\nThe *Scripture* says:\n*\"When governance is dim and broad,*\n*the people are pure and simple;\nwhen governance is sharp and probing,*\n*the people grow weary and depleted.*\n*Disaster, oh disaster—*\n*where fortune hides;\nfortune, oh fortune—*\n*where disaster lurks.*\nWho knows their end?\nPerhaps there is no rectitude.\nRectitude becomes the unexpected,\ngoodness becomes ominous—\nthe people have long been confused in their days.\"*\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\nThe ruler who follows the Dao\ngoverns with dim, broad, inclusive tolerance—\nthe people delight in life and follow their nature,\nthus, they return to simplicity and sincerity.\nThe ruler without virtue\ngoverns with sharp, clever, and harsh measures—\nthe people lose their livelihood and abandon their roots,\nthus, they grow weary and depleted.\nThus, dim governance, which the world calls *slack*,\nbrings true joy to the people;\nsharp governance, which the world calls *competent*,\nbrings true ruin to the people.\nJust as the world’s so-called disasters\nare all feared and hated—\nbecause they are feared and hated,\nfortune lies within them.\nAnd the world’s so-called fortunes\nare all cherished—\nbecause they are cherished,\ndisaster hides within them.\n\nThough calamity and fortune arise in tandem,\nnone can fathom their ultimate end—\nyet when examined for good and ill,\nhow could there be no principle?\n\nBroad governance and sincere people—\nthis may be called the True Way.\nFortune arising from disaster—\nthis may be called wise instruction.\n\nYet the world’s delusion endures long,\nknowing the True Way yet not following it,\nturning instead to perverse oddity;\nhearing wise instruction yet not believing it,\ninstead embracing monstrous deceit—\nthis is what the Sage laments.\n\nThus, the Sage upholds vast simplicity as virtue,\nwithout severing the True Way;\npractices utmost integrity in conduct,\nwithout causing grievous harm;\nholds to great rectitude in heart,\nwithout indulging in slander;\nemploys natural luminosity in action,\nwithout dazzling display—\nthis is the dim governance spoken of,\nhow could it be compared to the sharp rule of the world?\n\nThe **Daoist Classic** speaks:\n\nTo govern the people and serve the **Way** of Heaven,\nnothing surpasses **frugality**.\nFor only through **frugality** does one achieve **early return**—\nthe **early return** is called the **accumulation of virtue/power**,\nand the **accumulation of virtue/power** means nothing is unvanquished.\nIf nothing is unvanquished,\nthen its limits are beyond measure.\nBeyond measure in limits,\none may establish a state.\nThe state’s foundation,\none may endure long.\nThis is called the **Way** of deep roots and firm foundations,\nof **long life** and enduring vision.\n\nThe **Transmission** says:\nTo govern the people and serve the **Way** of Heaven,\nthe key lies in **frugality**.\n**Frugality** is the utmost of **simplicity** and restraint.\nIn **affairs**, **frugality** brings **plainness**,\nand in **principle**, it brings **substance**.\n**Substance** in serving the **Way** of Heaven\nwill earn Heaven’s blessings and aid—\nthis is called **\"sincerity brings fulfillment.\"**\nWith **plainness** in governing the people,\nthe people ascend to wealth and longevity—\nthis is called **\"restraint brings abundance.\"**\nOnly those who can guard **plainness** and **substance**\nwill swiftly revert to **primordial virtue/power**,\nthus achieving **early return**.\n**Early return** means refining excess into **plainness**,\ntransforming artificiality into **primordiality**—\nthis is called the **accumulation of enduring virtue/power**.\nThe **accumulation of enduring virtue/power**\nallows one to act with purpose,\nthus nothing remains unvanquished.\nIf nothing remains unvanquished,\none may act without force,\nthus its limits are beyond measure.\nBeyond measure in limits,\none’s life will not perish in vain,\nthus one may establish a state.\nThe state’s foundation lies in **frugality**,\nhence **frugality** is the mother of establishing a state.\nIf one guards the mother of establishing a state,\nthen its **Way** may endure long,\nits **virtue/power** may last forever.\nAs the state’s foundation,\nits roots are deep and cannot be uprooted,\nits trunk is firm and cannot be dug through.\nAs the state’s destiny,\nit grows long and knows no premature decay,\nits vision endures and never grows dim.\n\nThe **Daoist Classic** speaks:\nTo govern a great state,\none should treat it as cooking a small fish.\nThose who rule the world with the **Dao**—\ntheir spirits are not **divine**.\nNot that their spirits are not **divine**,\nbut that the **divine** does not harm people;\nNot that the **divine** does not harm people,\nbut that the Sage does not harm people.\nWhen both do not harm each other,\n**virtue/power** and **spirit** return in harmony.\n\nThe **Transmission** says:\nTo govern a state with ten thousand chariots\nis like cooking a fish no larger than a palm—\nthough one may adjust the water and fire,\nthe key is to avoid **overt manipulation**.\n**Overt manipulation** will harm the fish,\nand the fish harmed will spoil in the cauldron.\nSo too with ruling the world by the **Dao**—\nthough one may harmonize governance and teachings,\nthe key is to avoid **disturbance**.\n**Disturbance** will harm the people,\nand the people harmed will scatter in chaos within the state.\nThus, the Sage’s governance of the world\nlies in not harming people.\nIf so, then spirits and **divine** beings will be moved by the Sage’s **virtue/power**,\nand dare not harm people.\nNow, when speaking of ruling the world by the **Dao**,\nit says the spirits are not **divine**—\nfor the Sage’s **virtue/power** is the most beneficial in the **manifest**,\nwhile spirits’ harm is most insidious in the **hidden**.\nThus, it raises the extreme contrast\nto seek their **reconciliation**,\nto explore the **hidden** and **manifest** in depth.\nIn the *Book of Changes*’s *□* (hexagram of **dispersion**),\nthe ninth line says:\n*\"Seeing a boar trampling the mud,\na spirit loaded in a cart.\nFirst, the taut bow,\nthen, the slackened bow.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\nThe Sage’s **virtue/power** of not harming begins with this,\nand now it first speaks of spirits not being **divine**,\nto return and align with the Sage.\nFor spirits are **divine** only in their capacity to harm,\nand now they cannot harm because the **manifest** and **divine** do not harm people.\nThe spirits cannot be **divine**,\nand they do not harm people,\nbecause the Sage does not harm people.\nThe Sage does not harm people,\nso spirits and **divine** beings do not harm people.\nNow, having first raised that spirits and **divine** beings do not harm people,\nit returns to say the Sage does not harm people.\nThe Sage—\nwould they only prevent spirits and **divine** beings from harming people?\nThey also ensure people do not harm spirits and **divine** beings.\nWhen people and spirits rely upon each other,\nand neither harms the other,\nthen the **hidden** and **manifest** respond in harmony to the Sage’s **virtue/power**,\nhence it says **\"virtue/power and spirit return in harmony.\"**\n\nThe **Daoist Classic** speaks:\nThe great state is the **lowering** of the world,\nthe **intercourse** of the world—\nthe **intercourse** of the world is **feminine**.\nThe **feminine** always overcomes the **masculine** through **stillness**,\nand **stillness** is **lowering**.\nThus, the great state, in **lowering** itself to the small state,\ntakes the small state;\nThe small state, in **lowering** itself to the great state,\ntakes the great state.\nThus, sometimes **lowering** brings **taking**,\nsometimes **lowering** is **taking**.\nThe great state seeks only to **encompass and nurture** others,\nThe small state seeks only to **submit and serve** others—\nboth achieve their desires,\nhence the great should **lower** itself.\n\nThe **Transmission** says:\nThe great state is where all states converge,\nThe **lowering** is where all currents gather.\nWhere all currents gather,\nit becomes the **intercourse** of the world;\nWhere all states converge,\nit becomes the **feminine** of the world.\nThe **feminine**—\nin its **humility** and **stillness**, it guards itself,\nand is beloved by all the **masculine**.\nThe **feminine** always overcomes the **masculine**,\nnot because it is **soft** and **still**,\nbut because it can be the **foundation** for all things?\nThus, the **feminine**’s **stillness** and **humility**,\ntruly can overcome the **turbulent** and the **forceful**.\nHence, the ruler of the great state,\nif they grasp this **art**, will take the small state;\nThe ruler of the small state,\nif they grasp this **art**, will take the great state.\nThe great state **lowers** itself to the small state—\nthis is the **Dao**’s **action**,\nhence it says *\"sometimes **lowering** brings **taking**.\"*\nThe small state **lowers** itself to the great state—\nthis is the **Dao**’s **practice**,\nhence it says *\"sometimes **lowering** is **taking**.\"*\nThe great state seeks only to **encompass and nurture** the small state,\nto fulfill its greatness;\nThe small state seeks only to **submit and serve** the great state,\nto preserve its smallness.\nIf both are to fulfill their wishes,\nthen the ruler of the great state should **lower** themselves first,\nand the ruler of the small state will gladly submit to the great state.\nThus, this is truly the **intercourse** of the world, the **feminine** of the world.\nThe small state, in **lowering** itself to the great state,\nseeks only its own **preservation**,\nwhile the great state, in **lowering** itself to the small state,\ngains the world’s **convergence**—\nhence the great state should **lower** itself first.\n\nThe **Daoist Classic** speaks:\nThe **Dao** is the **hidden essence** of all things,\na treasure for the **good**,\na safeguard for the **not good**.\nFine words can **trade**,\nnoble conduct can **bestow** upon others.\nIf people are **not good**,\nwhat need is there to abandon them?\nThus, when establishing the **Son of Heaven**,\nappointing the **Three Exalted Ministers**,\neven if one has **arching jade** and **four-horse chariots** to precede them,\nit is not as good as **sitting and advancing** this **Dao**.\n\nThe ancients held this **Dao** in such high esteem—why not say that one may *daily* seek it and attain it, or that one may *avoid punishment* through it? Thus, it is the most precious for the world.\n\nThe **Commentary** states:\nThe **Dao** is vast and all-encompassing,\nhence it is the hidden essence of all things.\n\nThe **virtuous** obtain its use as if holding a treasure,\nwhile the **not virtuous** rely upon it for **preservation**—\nthus it is their safeguard.\nThose who adorn their speech can **trade** with the masses,\nthose who exalt their conduct can **bestow** upon others.\nHow much more so the **Dao**, subtle and profound,\nwhere nothing is beyond its reach!\nThe **virtuous** obtain it as a treasure,\nthe **not virtuous** find their safeguard—\nwhy then should the **virtuous** be honored,\nwhile the **not virtuous** are abandoned?\n\nThe **Master Lao** held **utter compassion** as his heart,\nthus he extolled and praised it.\nHow could one abandon the **not virtuous**?\n\nTherefore, when establishing the **Son of Heaven** and appointing the **Three Exalted Ministers**,\nit is precisely to teach the **not virtuous**.\nIf one honors the **virtuous** while abandoning the **not virtuous**,\nthen the **not virtuous** will have no further incentive to turn toward **self-renewal** and goodness,\nbut will instead be perpetually cast aside by the world—\nwhat use then would the **Son of Heaven** and the **Three Exalted Ministers** have in teaching and transforming?\n\nThus, even if one presents **arching jade** and precedes it with **four-horse chariots**,\nwhile frantically seeking **accomplished talent**,\nit is not as good as **sitting and advancing** this **Dao**.\n\nNow then, why from ancient times to the present has this **Dao** been held in such high esteem?\nIs it not because one may *daily* seek it and attain it,\nor that one may *avoid punishment* through it?\nWhy is it so?\n\nThe **Dao** lies near, yet people seek it afar—\nthen it cannot be attained.\nThus, seeking the **Dao** does not require distance;\nit lies in knowing its **return** (反).\nIf one can **return** to one’s own **body-mind** (身心),\nthen seeking will yield attainment—\nis this not the case that one may *daily* seek it and attain it?\n\nYet, why do people harbor so many **guilt and evils**?\nBecause they do not know the **Dao**.\nIf one can grasp the **Dao’s essence** and obtain its use,\nthen one may resolve conflicts and blunt sharpness,\novercome firmness and conquer strength—\nno one can contend, no thing can harm—\nis this not the case that one may *avoid punishment* through it?\n\nTherefore, the *Records* say:\nThe **Dao** is something one cannot for a moment depart from;\nwhat one can depart from is not the **Dao**.\nIf one is not thus **virtuous**,\nhow could one be worthy of the world’s highest honor?\n\nThe **Classic** states:\n**Act without acting**, **do without doing**, **savor without savoring**.\nGreat or small, much or little—\n**respond to resentment with virtue**.\nThe **Commentary** states:\nThose who embody the **Dao** are subtle and profound in their penetration of the world;\nthey **act** in response to the world, yet their root is **non-action**;\nthey **do** in response to the times, yet their essence is **non-doing**;\nthey **savor** in response to things, yet their foundation is **non-savoring**.\n\nThough their **embodiment** may be vast, their **primordial simplicity** (朴) is most minute;\nthough their **use** may be manifold, their **essence** (要) is most sparse.\nTheir **method** lies in **tranquil simplicity** and **stillness**,\nso that they are not bent by the myriad things.\n\nOnly thus may they be **without desire**;\n**without desire**, they are **without self-interest**.\n**Favor** is where **self-interest** resides,\n**resentment** is where **favor** takes root.\nOnly the **Sage** can be **without self-interest**,\n**without self-interest**, they have no **private favor**,\n**without private favor**, they have no **private resentment**.\nCommon people are not so;\nbecause they possess **self-interest**,\nthey have **favor and resentment**.\n\nYet, if the world harbors **resentment**,\nthe **Sage** **responds with virtue** to **resentment**;\nif people are **not virtuous**,\nthe **Sage** **nurtures virtue** in the **virtuous**.\nThus, the people live in harmony,\nand there is no **resentment** between ruler and ruled.\n\n**Responding to resentment with virtue**—\nis this what the *Records* call **the compassion that widens the self**?\nDid **Zhongni** (仲尼) say that one who fulfills the **Dao** throughout the world has no **resentment or guilt**?\nDid he ever speak of the **Sage** having **resentment** toward things?\n\nThe **Classic** states:\n**Plan difficulties** while they are easy,\n**achieve greatness** while they are small.\nThe world’s difficult matters must be begun when they are easy,\nthe world’s great matters must be begun when they are small.\nThus, the **Sage** never strives for the great,\nand so can accomplish the great.\n\nThe **Sage** who makes **light promises** will be **few in trustworthiness**,\nwho takes **many easy paths** will meet **many difficulties**—\nthus the **Sage** treats even the easy with caution,\nand so ultimately faces no difficulty.\n\nThe **Commentary** states:\nThe **pivot of action** (枢机) is the world’s most easy thing,\nyet when it moves the heavens and earth,\nit becomes the world’s most difficult thing.\nThe **most sincere clarity** is the world’s most minute thing,\nyet when it leads to **enduring longevity**,\nit becomes the world’s greatest thing.\n\nThus, to move the heavens and earth,\none must take **speech with utmost care** as primary;\nto achieve **enduring longevity**,\none must **cultivate flexibility** as foundation.\nHolding fast to the primary and grasping the foundation,\nthen the **principles of the world** are attained.\n\nAll begin with what is **easy and small**,\nyet complete in what is **difficult and great**—\nthus the **Sage** never strives for the great,\nand so can accomplish the great.\n\nThose who make **light promises** are **few in trustworthiness**,\nwho take **many easy paths** meet **many difficulties**—\nthus, it is better to have **self-resentment** than to fail in **promises**,\nbetter to have **actions float above words** than to have **words float above actions**.\nEven the **Sage** finds this difficult,\nhow much more so for the common people?\n\nOnly because one begins with what is **not easy**,\ndoes one end with what is **not difficult**—\nthus, if one does not make **light promises** at the start,\none will not be **few in trustworthiness** at the end.\nThis is an inevitable principle—\ncan one not strive to uphold it?\n\nThe **Classic** states:\nWhen its **stability** is easy to maintain,\nwhen its **ominous signs** are easy to **plot against**,\nwhen its **fragility** is easy to **shatter**,\nwhen its **subtlety** is easy to **dissipate**—\n**act before it exists**, **govern before it is disordered**.\nA tree thick enough to embrace grows from a tiny sprout;\na nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;\na journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath one’s feet.\n\nThe **Commentary** states:\nIf the world is yet **stable**, it is easy to maintain its **fullness**;\nif a **state** is already **dangerous**, it is difficult to **settle its decline**.\nIf **deceitful intent** has not yet **manifested**, it is easy to **devise plots** and **eliminate it**;\nif **evil appearance** has already **taken shape**, it is difficult to **erase its extinction**.\nIf **sprouts** are still **tender**, their **calamities** are easy to **break**;\nif **branches and trunks** have already **formed**, their **disasters** are difficult to **blunt**.\nIf **regret and stinginess** are yet **subtle**, their **worries** are easy to **dispel**;\nif **wickedness and retribution** have already **become evident**, their **sin** is difficult to **pursue**.\nThus, the **Sage** **acts before it exists**,\nso that its **evil** does not **sprout**;\n**governs before it is disordered**,\nso that **harm** does not **arise**.\n\nTherefore, the **Sage’s governance** is **without knowing** and **without desire**;\nthey **perceive its mechanisms**,\ntake **caution in its subtleties**,\nso that the common people may **daily use** it without knowing.\n\nIf one does not **prevent** it beforehand or **govern** it early,\nit is like planting a tree beginning with its **sprout**—\none may **pluck** it and **sever** it while still **tender**,\nbut once it reaches **embrace-thickness** and beyond,\nit becomes **unfellable**.\n\nIt is like building a terrace beginning with a **mound of earth**—\none may **kick** it and **collapse** it while still **low**,\nbut once it rises to **nine layers** and beyond,\nit becomes **indestructible**.\n\nIt is like embarking on a **long journey** beginning with the **first step**—\none may **retreat** it with a **single tread**,\nbut once it extends to **a thousand li** and beyond,\nit becomes **irreversible**.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Treading frost, solid ice arrives.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"The doer brings about its ruin; the grasper loses it.\"*\nThus, the Sage, by **non-action**, knows no ruin,\nby **non-grasp**, knows no loss.\n\nThe people’s undertakings\nare ever **nearly complete** when they **fail**.\nTo **revere the end as the beginning** is to know no ruin.\n\nThus, the Sage **desires without desiring**,\ndoes not **value** hard-to-obtain wealth;\n**learns without learning**,\nreversing the common people’s **errors**.\n\nTo **assist** the **natural unfolding** of all things\nwithout **daring to act**.\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"Position\"* is the Sage’s **greatest treasure**.\n*\"The realm\"* is the **divine instrument** of the world.\nThe **divine instrument** cannot be **seized** and **wielded**—\nto seize and wield it is to **ensure ruin**.\nThe **greatest treasure** cannot be **held** and **possessed**—\nto hold and possess it is to **ensure loss**.\n\nThus, when the Sage **holds the realm**,\nthey **delight in yielding** without **satiation**,\nso there is **nothing to seize**.\nTo **seize nothing** is to **know no ruin**.\nWhen the Sage **possesses the greatest treasure**,\nthey **complete the work** without **dwelling upon it**,\nso there is **nothing to grasp**.\nTo **grasp nothing** is to **know no loss**.\n\nThe common people’s nature **loves action**—\naction brings **many affairs**, many affairs bring **ruin**.\nThus, in their **undertakings in the world**,\nthey are ever **nearly complete** when they **fail**.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they do not **take care at the beginning**.\n\nIf one **takes care at the beginning**,\n**considering the end**,\nthen nothing surpasses **few desires**.\nFew desires mean few affairs,\nfew affairs mean no ruin.\nBecause they **take care at the beginning**,\nthey can **complete without ruin**.\nRooted in **taking care at the beginning**,\nthey make **completion without ruin**.\n\nThis is why **both ruin and no ruin** are **held up**—\nto show the **vast difference** between the common and the Sage.\n\nNow, what the common people **desire** is **wealth and beauty**.\nWhat they **do not desire** is **clarity and tranquility**.\nThe Sage **desires what they do not desire**,\nthus does not **value** hard-to-obtain wealth.\n\nWhat the common people **learn** is **worldly deeds**.\nWhat they **do not learn** is **non-action**.\nThe Sage **learns what they do not learn**,\nthus **reverses** the common people’s **errors**.\n\nThey **thicken** what **is so**,\nonly to **assist** the **natural unfolding** of all things.\nThus, they **dare not act**, **dare not grasp**,\nand so **know no ruin, no loss**.\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"The ancients who excelled in the Dao*\ndid not **enlighten** the people,\nbut **made them ignorant** instead.\nThe people are **difficult to govern** because they are **too clever**.\nThus, governing with **cleverness** is the **ruin** of the realm;\nnot governing with **cleverness** is the **blessing** of the realm.\nTo know these two is the **standard**.\"\n\nTo **constantly know the standard** is called **mysterious virtue**.\n**Mysterious virtue** is profound, distant,\n**contrary to things**—\nonly then does it reach **great harmony**.\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"The reason the rivers and seas can be the **sovereigns** of all valleys*\nis that they **excel in humility**,\nthus they become the **sovereigns** of all valleys.\nThus, the Sage **desires to be above** others—\nby **speaking humbly** beneath them;\n**desires to lead** others—\nby **placing themselves behind** them.\nThus, though **placed above**, others do not **feel burdened**;\nthough **placed before**, others do not **feel harmed**.\nThus, the world **delights in yielding** without **satiation**.\nBecause they **do not contend**, the world cannot **contend with them**.\"\n\n**Scripture** says:\nThe *Classic of Changes* states:\n*\"The Way of Heaven diminishes the **excessive** and benefits the **modest**;\nthe Way of Earth transforms the **excessive** and flows toward the **modest**;\nspirits and gods **harm the excessive** and **bridge the modest**;\nthe Way of humanity **hates the excessive** and **loves the modest**.\n**Modesty** as a virtue—\n**lowly** yet **nurturing itself**—\nthus the rivers and seas, by **modesty**, become the virtue\nto which all valleys **turn**.\nThe Sage, by **modesty**, becomes the virtue\nto which the world **first ascends**.\nDoes the Sage **desire to ascend first**?\nNo—\nthe world **delights in yielding** without **satiation**.\nThus, it is said **‘desire to ascend first’**—\nto **exhort** the people with the Sage’s example.\n\nNow, when the Sage **occupies the highest position**,\ndo they **contend** to attain it?\nThe *Book of Documents* says:\n*\"You alone do not contend,\nthus none contend with your ability;\nyou alone do not **boast**,\nthus none contend with your **merits.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"The world all say my Dao is great,\nyet seems **unworthy**.\"*\n\n**The Great, thus appearing unworthy.**\nIf it were worthy for long, then it would be trifling indeed.\nI possess three treasures—guard them and uphold them:\nFirst, **compassion**; second, **frugality**; third, **not daring to act first under Heaven**.\n\n**Compassion**, thus one can be **courageous**; **frugality**, thus one can be **abundant**; **not daring to act first under Heaven**, thus one can become the **master of implements and leader**.\n\nNow, if one **discards compassion** and yet **pretends to courage**, **discards frugality** and yet **pretends to abundance**, **discards humility** and yet **pretends to act first**, then one is **undone**.\n\n**Compassion**, in war makes one **upright**; in defense makes one **steadfast**. When Heaven intends to save a people, it does so with **compassion as their shield**.\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"All under Heaven say the Dao of Laozi is vast and broad,\nyet seems unilluminated and wise—\nlike an unworthy person.\nLaozi alone knows his Dao is most great,\nthus he appears as such an unworthy one.\nIf the world were to deem him worthy,\nthen his Dao would have long been trifling—\nhow could it still be called great?\"*\n\n**Commentary** says:\n*\"Ning Wuzi’s wisdom may be imitated,\nbut his folly cannot—\nthis is close indeed.\nYet though my Dao appears unworthy,\nits three treasures are precious—\nif guarded and upheld, they can govern.\nThey are **compassion**, **frugality**, and **not daring to act first under Heaven**.\"*\n\nThose who **take pity on all things** must be **bold in rescue**—\nthis is the **courage of the virtuous**.\nThose who **are frugal in use** must be **generous in giving**—\nthis is **moderation in expenditure and love for the people**.\nThose who **do not act first under Heaven** must become **masters of implements and leaders**—\nthis is **using the nine [trigrams] and seeing the group of dragons without a head—auspicious indeed**.\n\nNow, what the world calls **worthy** is not so:\nThey **discard compassion** and yet **pretend to righteous courage**, plunging others into ruin—\nthis is **excessive to the point of self-destruction**.\nThey **discard frugality** and yet **pretend to lavish giving**, depleting wealth and harming the people.\nThey **abandon what would place them last** and yet **pretend to act first under Heaven**—\nthis is **rebellion and treason**.\n\nSuch actions **do not accord with the Dao**,\nand they **invite their own ruin**.\nYet of these three treasures, **compassion is most precious**.\nTo **take pity on all things** is to **grieve and love them**.\nThose who love others are loved in return;\nthose who grieve for others are grieved for in return.\nWhen others grieve for you, they aid you—\nthus, in battle, your ranks stand **upright**.\nWhen others love you, they protect you—\nthus, in defense, your **walls and cities stand firm**.\nThis is why, when Heaven intends to save a people,\nit **endows them with compassion and love**.\nWhen a people have compassion, their battle lines are **upright**,\ntheir defenses **unshaken**—\nthus, **compassion is their shield**.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"When Heaven aids them, it is auspicious—\nnothing is unfavorable.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nWhen Heaven intends to **abandon a people**,\nit **loads them with calamitous virtue**.\nA people with calamitous virtue have **disordered battle lines**,\n**collapsing defenses**—\nthus, **calamitous virtue brings defeat**.\n\n*The Sayings* say:\n*\"When Heaven thickens their wickedness,\ntheir wickedness thickens—\nthey are near to collapse.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"The skilled warrior is not fierce,\nthe skilled fighter does not rage,\nthe skilled victor does not contend,\nthe skilled ruler places himself below others.\nThis is called the **virtue of non-contention**,\nthis is called **using the strength of others**,\nthis is called **harmonizing with Heaven**—\nthe ultimate of the ancients.\"*\n\n**Commentary** says:\n*\"The skilled commander of soldiers\nloves the people with compassion,\ndoes not strike first,\nthus is not **brutally fierce**.\nThe skilled in battle\n**leads and waits for response**,\ndoes not delight in **overwhelming the enemy**,\nthus does not **threaten with anger**.\nThe skilled in victory\ndoes not **move for gain**,\nbut **follows the momentum** to take,\nthus does not **act first**.\nThe skilled in using others\n**humbles themselves**, **diminishes their own worth**,\nand **aligns with the lowest**—\nthus they are always **below others**.\n\nWhen using troops, they **conquer with harmony**—\nthis is the **virtue of non-contention**.\nWhen leading the people, they **delight them in facing danger**—\nthis is **using the strength of others**.\nSuch is the **natural way of Heaven**,\nwith no artifice—\nthus they can **conquer and harmonize with the Divine**,\nthe ultimate of the ancients.\"*\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"In the use of arms, there is a saying:\n‘I do not dare to be the aggressor but the defender,\nI do not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot.’\nThis is called **moving without movement**,\n**pushing without arms**,\n**grasping without weapons**,\n**confronting without enemies**.\nNo greater calamity than **underestimating the enemy**—\nto underestimate the enemy is nearly to **lose my treasures**.\nThus, when armies clash,\nthe **compassionate prevail**.\"*\n\n**Commentary** says:\n*\"Laozi laments the world’s use of arms,\ntaking **killing as their foundation**,\nthus he cites ancient military strategies\nto show the **reluctance of necessary warfare**.\n\nThe laws of wielding troops:\nThe aggressor **plans to raise arms**,\nthe defender **responds to the enemy**.\nThough advancing little, they **draw near to killing**;\nthough retreating much, they **turn toward life**—\nthus, **one does not dare to be the aggressor but the defender**,\n**does not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot**—\nthis is **bold in daring to kill**,\nbut **bold in not daring is to preserve life**.\n\nThus, when the general **moves forward with the front foot in order**,\nit seems as if there is **no formation to follow**.\nWhen the general **raises his arm to charge first**,\nit seems as if there is **no arm to raise**.\nWhen the general **takes up his weapons**,\nit seems as if there are **no weapons to wield**.\nHis enemy seems **without resistance**—\nconstantly rooted in **compassion and love**,\nnot delighting in killing,\nthe people **move for him in response**,\nas if **hands rescue the head**,\nas if **sons rescue their fathers**—\nultimately, **unmatched under Heaven**.\n\nThose who are **unmatched under Heaven**—\nthis is **victory in war**.\nVictory in war **necessarily involves much killing**,\nand **much killing is the greatest calamity**.\nYet if one **abandons compassion**,\nthis is **extreme unworthiness**—\nso why say it is **near to losing my treasures**?\n\nI **originally relied on compassion and love**,\nnot delighting in killing—\nonly when **forced** did I become unmatched,\nnot my true intent.\nSince it was not my original intent,\nthis is **a loss**—\nthough not yet **utter ruin**,\nthus it is said **near to losing**.\n\nFrom this, when armies clash\nand victory is **not yet decided**,\nif one **loves their people**,\nthey will **preserve their victory whole**.\"*\n\n「Who then? The one who loves their people\nwill necessarily grieve over their deaths.\nWhen the people know their ruler grieves over their deaths,\nthey will in turn grieve over their ruler’s loss of life—\nthus they rally to give their lives,\nand the ruler secures their victory whole.\n\nAt the outset, love for the people is the foundation;\nat the end, grief over death brings victory—\nthus it is said: *grief brings victory*.\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"My words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to follow.\nYet none under Heaven can know them,\nnone can follow them.\nWords have a principle,\naffairs have a sovereign—\nit is only because they lack knowledge,\nthat they do not know me.\"*\n\nThose who know me are few,\nso those who follow me are precious.\nThus the Sage wears coarse robes while cherishing jade within.\n\n**Commentary** says:\nLaozi’s words are,\n*\"My words must have substance,\nthus they are very easy to follow—\nyet people under Heaven are benighted by desire,\nso none can follow them.\nYet my actions have sovereigns—\nsovereigns meaning *principles*.\nIt is only because none under Heaven can know these,\nthat they do not know me.*\n\nIf one speaks of *subtle and profound* [微妙玄通],\ndeep and unrecognizable,\nthen those who know me are few indeed.\nIf only I possess what others cannot recognize,\nthen what I have is precious indeed.\nThus the Sage wears coarse robes to obscure his exterior,\ncherishes jade to preserve his interior.\nThis is what the **Scripture** means by:\n*'True substance is like unrefined jade'* [质真若渝].\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"To know what one does not know is noble;\nto not know what one knows is sickness.\nIt is only through sickness of sickness,\nthat one does not fall ill.\nThe Sage does not fall ill,\nbecause they can be sickened by sickness—\nthus they do not fall ill.\"*\n\n**Commentary** says:\n*\"To be clear and far-reaching,\nyet appear as one who does not know,\nthis is noble knowing.\nTo not know this clear and far-reaching,\nthis is knowing as sickness.\nIt is only through being able to be sickened by what is sick,\nthat what is sick cannot sicken them.\nThus the Sage is not afflicted by knowing,\nbecause they can be afflicted by the sickness of knowing—\nso knowing cannot afflict them.\"*\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"If the people do not fear great threats,\nthen greater threats will come.\nDo not trample where you reside,\ndo not exhaust what you are born with.\nIt is only through not exhausting,\nthat one does not exhaust.\nThus the Sage knows themselves but does not display themselves,\nloves themselves but does not exalt themselves—\ntherefore they discard that and take this.\"*\n\n**Commentary** says:\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"The petty man, seeing no profit, does not exert himself;\nseeing no threat, does not fear.\nSmall punishments and great warnings—\nthis is the petty man’s blessing.\nThus it is said: *‘A wooden clog destroys the foot, yet there is no blame.’*\nThe petty man, treating minor vices as harmless and not removing them,\nallows them to accumulate beyond concealment,\nand their crimes grow beyond absolution.\nThus it is said: *‘A load of clogs destroys the ear, bringing disaster.’*\nThis is the meaning of: *‘If the people do not fear great threats, then greater threats will come.’*\n\nThe petty man’s reason for not fearing threats and not removing vices\nis the *error of the heart*.\nWhen great threats come and cannot be absolved,\nthis is the *calamity of the body*.\nThe Sage is otherwise:\nthey know the heart’s errors and remove them,\nlove their body and fear its calamities—\nthus they can nourish life and preserve form whole.\n\nThe heart is where the *spirit* [神] habitually resides.\nIf one does not profane it with indulgent desires,\nthen it will not be trampled.\nThe *spirit* is what gives life to form.\nIf one does not weary it with excessive affairs,\nthen it will not be exhausted.\nIt is only because people do not exhaust the *spirit*,\nthat the *spirit* does not exhaust people—\nthus it is said: *‘To know the heart’s errors and remove them,\nnot to display oneself yet nourish life.’*\nTo love one’s body and fear calamities,\nnot to exalt oneself yet preserve form whole.\nIf one exalts and can preserve form whole,\nif one displays and can nourish life,\nthen this is teaching the people to nourish life by *non-Dao* means,\nto preserve form by *non-principle* means.\nThus one discards that display and exaltation,\nand takes this knowing and loving.\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"To dare with courage is to kill;\nto not dare with courage is to live.\nThese two paths—\none brings benefit, one brings harm.\nWhat does Heaven abhor?\nWho knows its reason?\"*\nThus the Sage finds it difficult.\n\nThe *Dao of Heaven*,\ndoes not contend yet wins well,\ndoes not speak yet responds well,\ndoes not summon yet comes of its own accord,\nis humble yet plans well.\nThe Heavenly net is vast and sweeping,\nloose yet never misses.\n\n**Commentary** says:\n*\"To dare with resolute courage—\nthis is the path of killing.\nTo dare without resolute courage—\nthis is the path of life.\nBoth require courage,\nyet their applications differ:\nto dare with courage harms life,\nto dare without courage benefits life.\nThen does Heaven abhor this daring courage?\nThis obstinacy?\nThe daring courage harms life,\nthe obstinacy harms oneself—\nwho knows Heaven’s reason for abhorring daring courage and obstinacy?\nPerhaps it is because they cannot use *gentleness and yielding* [巽顺柔弱]?\nThe *Book of Documents* says:\n*'High and exalted, yielding overcomes.'*\nThus Heaven takes *gentleness and yielding* as *virtue*.\n\nHow is this proven?\nHeaven does not contend with all things,\nyet all things submit of their own accord—\nthis is *well-winning*.\nHeaven does not speak to the people,\nyet the people trust naturally—\nthis is *well-responding*.\nHeaven does not contend with the four seasons,\nyet the four seasons come in their time—\nthis is *coming of its own accord*.\nThough possessing three *virtues*,\nHeaven does not act first—\nyet it manifests symbols and reveals auspicious or inauspicious signs,\nknowing them before their appearance.\nIt blesses the good and punishes the licentious,\nnot differing by a hair’s breadth—\nthis may be called *well-planning*.\nThus the Heavenly net, though vast and loose,\nnever misses those who reverse the *Dao* or ruin *virtue*.\nThe *Book of Documents* says:\n*'For goodness, Heaven bestows a hundred blessings;\nfor evil, Heaven bestows a hundred calamities.'*\nThis is what is meant.\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"The people are always not afraid of death—\nhow can one frighten them with death?\nIf one makes the people always afraid of death,\nand they act strangely,\nI can seize and kill them—\nwho would dare?\nThere are always those charged with killing who kill.\nBut if those who are not charged with killing kill,\nthis is like substituting for the master carpenter.\nTo substitute for the master carpenter,\nthere are few who do not injure their hands.\"*»\n\n**Commentary** says:\n*\"People under Heaven are always ensnared by profit and desire,\nthough threatened with death, they still do not cease—\nhow then should the rulers of this age\ncreate harsh punishments and cruel laws,\nand drive them by fear of death?\"*\n\nIf the people are always made to fear death,\nthen I may seize and kill those who act strangely—\nwho would dare to do so again?\nEven now, though I may kill them,\nthose who act strangely do not cease,\nand thus it is clear that the people do not truly fear death.\n\nThen why impose harsh punishments and cruel laws,\nwhich cannot even awe the masses?\nIf so, those guilty under Heaven\nshould be entrusted to the most just executioners.\nThus, the Sage follows Heaven’s will and clarifies its authority,\nto govern the Five Punishments.\nThe master of just execution is called the *司杀者* [Executor].\nThe *Scripture* says:\n*\"Heaven punishes the guilty—\nthe Five Punishments are fully applied.\"*\nTherefore, punishment aims not to punish,\nbut to show mercy in punishment.\nIf the ruler does not let the Executor judge crimes by the most just principles,\nbut arbitrarily kills at will,\nthis is like a substitute carpenter hewing wood—\none who is unskilled in hewing but still takes the place of another.\nIf one is unskilled in hewing yet still takes another’s place,\ntheir hands will surely be injured,\ntheir work ruined—\nthis is what is meant by *\"few who do not injure their hands.\"*\n\nThus, Guan Zhong said:\n*\"The ruler should perfect the Way of the high officials,\nyet not meddle in their affairs.\nTherefore, when the ruler interferes in matters below,\nthe officials cannot fulfill their duties—\nthe horses cannot run as they should,\nthe birds cannot fly as they should.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"The people’s hunger comes from their rulers taking too much in taxes—\nthus they hunger.\nThe people are hard to govern because their rulers act too much—\nthus they are hard to govern.\nThe people treat death lightly because their rulers provide too much for life—\nthus they treat death lightly.\nOnly those who do not seek life are wiser than those who cherish life.\"*\n\n**Commentary** says:\n*\"In ancient times, public fields were recorded but not taxed;\nlater, the tithe was imposed—\nthis was the standard for all under Heaven.\nNow, if those above take too much in taxes,\nthe people cannot help but hunger.\nIn ancient times, those above had no desires, no actions,\nso their people had little to do,\neach following their nature.\nNow, those above act and desire,\nso their people have much to do,\ncannot secure their lives,\nand thus governance becomes difficult.\nThe people’s lives have inherent limits—\nthey cannot be overindulged.\nIf their lives are overindulged,\nthey will exceed natural limits,\nand exceeding limits in life\nwill surely bring death.\nThus, treating death lightly comes from overindulgence in life.\nOnly those who do not cling to life\nare wiser than those who cherish it.\"*\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"When people are born, they are soft and weak;\nwhen they die, they become stiff and strong.\nAll plants and grasses, when born, are soft and fragile;\nwhen they die, they wither and decay.\nThus, stiffness and strength belong to death,\nsoftness and weakness belong to life.\nTherefore, strong armies do not conquer,\nrigid trees split.\nThe strong and great are placed below.\nThe weak and soft are placed above.\"*\n\n**Commentary** says:\n*\"Life is soft and weak, death is stiff and strong—\nthis is the shared fate of all things.\nThus, the Sage cherishes softness and weakness,\nrejects stiffness and strength.\nIf armies are strong against the people,\nthe lords will unite against their state;\nif trees are rigid in their trunks,\ntheir branches and leaves will wither above.\nThus, strong trunks and great roots are always below,\nweak branches and tender shoots are always above.\nIf even trees are so,\nhow much more so for people?\nHow much more so for states?\"*\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"The Way of Heaven—\nis it not like drawing a bow?\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised.\nThe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\nThe Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient.\nBut the Way of humanity does the opposite:\nit diminishes the deficient and bestows upon the excessive.\nWho can bestow upon the world with their excess?\nOnly the Sage can do so.\nThus, the Sage acts but does not rely on it,\nachieves success but does not claim it—\nis this not because they do not wish to appear virtuous?\"*\n\n**Commentary** says:\n*The *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Establishing Heaven’s Way is called yin and yang.\nYang ascends, yin descends.\nWhen yang ascends to its peak in Heaven, it descends;\nwhen yin descends to its peak on Earth, it ascends.\nThis is lowering the high and raising the low—\nthe image of a drawn bow.\nHeaven’s Way of fullness and emptiness:\none cycle, seven intercalations,\ndiminishing the excess of days,\nsupplementing the deficiency of months.\nBut the Way of humanity does the opposite:\nit diminishes the deficient people,\nwhile bestowing upon the excessive ruler.\nWho can follow Heaven’s Way to make it the Way of humanity,\ndiminishing their own excess\nto bestow upon the world’s deficiencies?\nOnly the Sage can do so.\nIn the *Classic of Changes*, ‘diminishing below and supplementing above’ is called *Punishment* [损],\n‘diminishing above and supplementing below’ is called *Benefit* [益],\nwith the low as the root.\nThus, the Sage can act without relying on their deeds,\ncan achieve success without claiming it—\nbecause they do not wish to appear virtuous to others,\nand thus the world calls them ‘seemingly unworthy,’\nall in accordance with the principle of diminishing excess and bestowing deficiency.\"*\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"Under Heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than water,\nyet nothing can overcome the strong and rigid like it—\nthere is nothing to replace it.\nThus, the soft overcomes the hard,\nthe weak overcomes the strong—\nall under Heaven know this,\nyet none can practice it.\nTherefore, the Sage says:\n‘To bear a state’s filth is called the Lord of Soil and Grain;\nto bear a state’s misfortunes is to be King of all under Heaven.’\nThus, correct speech seems contrary.\"*\n\n**Commentary** says:\n*\"The flow of water, though fine, can drill through stone—\nthis is because of its softness and weakness,\nand nothing can replace it.\nThus, it is clear that softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength.\nAll under Heaven know this,\nyet none can emulate and practice it,\nso Laozi cites the Sage’s words to exhort them—\nthis is also the remnant of the *Three Ancient Classics*.\nTo bear a state’s filth and impurity,\none may become its Lord of Soil and Grain;\nto bear a state’s misfortunes,\none may become King of all under Heaven—\nthese words are very correct,\nyet they seem contrary when observed.\nThe *Commentary* says:\n‘Mountains and marshes receive filth,\nthe sovereign bears shame.’\nThis is close to the meaning.\"*\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"To reconcile great grudges,\nthere must be remaining grudges—\nhow can this be considered good?\"*\n\nThus the Sage holds the left tablet of the contract,\nyet does not demand repayment from others.\nTherefore, one of virtue oversees the contract,\nwhile one without virtue oversees the receipt.\nThe Dao of Heaven shows no favoritism,\nyet always aligns with the virtuous.\n\n*The Commentary* says:\n‘When ruler and people are in harmony,\nthe people harbor no grudges.\nWhen ruler and people are estranged,\ngreat grudges arise.\nThough one may reconcile them,\nthe harm remains unhealed.\nWith lingering grudges,\nhow can this be considered good?\nMust it not be that there be no grudges at all?’\n\nIn ancient times, when knots were tied to make covenants,\nthe people did not deceive.\nWhen wooden tablets were split to record agreements,\nthe people did not violate them.\nWhy?\nBecause the Sage had no fixed intentions,\ntaking the hearts of the people as their own.\nThus, the Sage’s heart and the people’s heart\nwere like the left and right tablets of a contract.\nWhen the contract was presented, it was fulfilled without demand,\nso ruler and people were in harmony,\nand grudges never arose.\n\nLater generations could not hold the left tablet to respond to affairs,\nbut instead upheld the fixed receipt to govern the people.\nSeeking harmony in this way\ninevitably left lingering grudges.\n\nThus, it is known:\nA ruler of virtue oversees the heart-contract to avoid grudges—\nthis alone attains goodness.\nA ruler without virtue oversees only the written record to reconcile grudges—\nhow can this be considered good?\n\nThe Dao of Heaven shows no partiality,\nbestowing itself only upon the virtuous,\njust as the Sage holds the left tablet,\ntaking only the hearts of others as their own.\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"In small states with few people,\nlet the people have ten-fold or hundred-fold tools,\nyet they shall not use them.\nLet the people hold death in reverence\nand not wander far.\nThough there be boats and carriages,\nthey shall have no need to ride them.\nThough there be armor and weapons,\nthey shall have no need to display them.\nLet the people return to using knotted cords for contracts.\nLet their food be savored,\ntheir garments fine,\ntheir dwellings secure,\ntheir customs joyous.\nNeighboring states, though near enough to hear roosters crow and dogs bark,\nlet the people reach old age and die\nwithout visiting one another.\"*\n\n*The Commentary* says:\n‘Small states with few people,\nby nature unable to sustain themselves,\nyet if one of the Way governs them,\nthey can still prevent the people from using their ten-fold or hundred-fold tools\nfor warfare.\nThus, the people cherish life and revere death,\nare content with their land and do not migrate.\nThey do not seek distant allies for aid,\nso though there be boats and carriages,\nthey have no need to ride them.\nThey do not engage in aggression for gain,\nso though there be armor and weapons,\nthey have no need to display them.\nRuler and people live in harmony,\nthe living and the dead are without deceit.\nThe people return to using knotted cord covenants,\nand do not violate them.\nTheir desires are few,\nso they savor their coarse food,\nadmire their frugal garments.\nTheir taxes are light,\nso they are content in their dwellings,\nand their customs flourish.\nThough neighboring states are close enough to hear roosters crow and dogs bark,\nyet without desires or demands,\neach attains what they need,\nand thus they reach old age and die\nwithout visiting one another.\nThis is the pinnacle of governance.\nLaozi’s exposition of the teaching of Dao and virtue—\nhis intent lies here.’\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"Faithful words are not ornate,\nornate words are not faithful.\nThe virtuous do not argue,\nthose who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise are not learned,\nthe learned are not wise.\nThe Sage accumulates nothing.\nThe more one gives to others, the more one possesses.\nThe more one bestows upon others, the more one has.\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming,\nthe Dao of the Sage acts without contending.\"*\n\n*The Commentary* says:\n‘Faithful and true words need not be ornate,\nfor they are plain in substance.\nOrnate and beautiful words need not be faithful,\nfor they are superficial in form.\nThe virtuous in heart need not argue,\nfor they are rooted in simplicity.\nThose skilled in speech need not be virtuous,\nfor they value eloquence.\nThe wise in essence need not be learned,\nfor less is more in understanding.\nThe learned in affairs need not be wise,\nfor excess leads to confusion.\nThe Sage bestows virtue without private gain,\nso they accumulate nothing.\nExhausting virtue for others,\none’s own virtue grows ever greater;\nexhausting benefit for others,\none’s own benefit grows ever more abundant.\nThe Dao of Heaven—\nin spring and summer it nurtures and stores,\nin autumn and winter it matures and ripens—\nthis is to benefit without harming.\nThe Dao of the Sage—\nit follows the natural order of things,\nyet does not contend with them,\nfor it models itself after Heaven.’",

      "translated_text": "**The Transmission of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue**\n\n*Title:* The Transmission of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue. Transmitted by Lu Xisheng of the Tang. Four fascicles.\n\n*Source of the Base Text:* \"Washing the Spirit\" Section, Jade Category, *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*.\n*Collated Edition:* Wuqiu Beizhai’s photolithographic reprint of the *Zhihai* edition, published by Qian Xizuo during the Daoguang reign of the Qing (hereafter referred to as the *Zhihai* edition). This work does not divide chapters by name.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Transmission of the True Classic of Dao and Virtue***\n\nThe Preface states:\n\nWhen the Great Dao lay hidden and worldly teachings declined, the realm descended into chaos. At such times, Heaven inevitably gives rise to sages. These sages, grieving that the people had not attained order, devised methods to uphold the declining and rescue the chaotic.\n\nBy the late Zhou, such a moment had nearly arrived. Thus, Confucius expounded the culture of the Five Dynasties to uphold its decline, while Laozi grounded himself in the simplicity of the Three Sovereigns to remedy its chaos—their aims were one.\n\nConfucius’s teachings flourished through culture, using culture to govern the emotions. Laozi’s teachings originated in simplicity, employing simplicity to restore nature. The ultimate of nature and emotion cannot differ for sages; yet the transformations of culture and simplicity cannot be uniform across the ages.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Manifesting through benevolence.\" This refers to teaching through culture. Such teaching is evident in its affairs, thus open and clear. Being open and clear, refined speech becomes detailed.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Concealing through application.\" This refers to teaching through simplicity. Such teaching is subtle in its principles, thus profound and unrecognizable. Being profound and unrecognizable, those who fabricate falsely multiply.\n\nOnly Laozi’s teachings take the Dao as their essence and names as their function, practicing non-action yet accomplishing all, aligning with the imperial standard. Yang Zhu adhered to Laozi’s essence but fell short, valuing the self and belittling things. Zhuang Zhou expounded Laozi’s function but overreached, striving to abolish sages and discard wisdom. Shen [Buhai] and Han [Fei] misapplied Laozi’s names, leading to harshness and rigidity. Wang [Bi] and He [Yan] lost Laozi’s Dao, drifting into emptiness and recklessness. These six masters were all transgressors against Laozi.\n\nYet the world claims that Laozi’s intent does not align with Confucius. Thus, they slander his name, accusing him of striking down benevolence and righteousness, abolishing ritual and learning. They criticize his Dao, saying it relies solely on purity and emptiness—how could this govern? Alas, the world’s delusion has persisted for long. This has caused Laozi to suffer slander for a thousand years, his Dao unfulfilled in his own era, and there is good reason for it.\n\nMoreover, Laozi traced the origins of Heaven and Earth, recounted the changes of past and present, first clarifying Dao and virtue, then expounding benevolence and righteousness, and finally exposing the failures of ritual and music, the excesses of punishments and governance. His words describe how things naturally come to be. Holding to the essential and grasping the root, he focused on the ultimate of nature and emotion. Thus, his Dao begins with body and mind, takes form in family and state, and extends to the world—so comprehensive is it. Yet some still speak recklessly—is this not a grave slander?\n\nOf old, Fuxi drew the Eight Trigrams, symbolizing the myriad things, exhausting the principles of nature and destiny, and harmonizing with the Dao and virtue. Laozi, too, preceded Heaven and Earth, rooted in yin and yang, deduced the ultimate of nature and destiny, and explored the mysteries of Dao and virtue—this aligns with Fuxi in origin.\n\nKing Wen observed the movements of the nine and six in the *Great Change*, valuing firmness and esteeming transformation, yet centering on the mean. Laozi also examined the correctness of the seven and eight in the *Great Change*, attaining softness and maintaining stillness, yet unifying them in the great—this shares a lineage with King Wen.\n\nConfucius followed the examples of Yao and Shun, modeled himself on Wen and Wu, and guided the people with the teaching of benevolence and righteousness. Laozi likewise emulated Fuxi, encompassed the Yellow Emperor, and covered the world with the transformation of Dao and virtue—this aligns in principle with the Master.\n\nThese three noble ones were the pinnacle of sages. Laozi transformed and connected with them, returning to unite with them, investigating the mechanism of ultimate change and exploring the subtleties of utmost refinement—this may be called the most divine.\n\nYet Wang Bi claimed that sages unite with the Dao in substance, while Laozi could not embody the Dao. Thus, Ruan Ji called him a \"superior worthy, a near-sage,\" aligning with [Wang] Fusi. Could it be that Laozi’s traces in governing the world were insufficient to fulfill his words? This is not so.\n\nAlas, when sages are in the world, some leave traces, some do not. Thus, when the Dao is not practiced, some humble themselves and journey through the realm, taking the world’s troubles as their own; others conceal their names and flee, showing that worldly affairs cannot entangle them. Whether leaving traces or not, different paths lead to the same end—this is truly the gateway of Dao and righteousness, not merely opposition.\n\nThus, Confucius’s emergence and Laozi’s seclusion, Laozi’s silence and Confucius’s speech—these are the extremes of yielding and extending, concealing and revealing. How could those two masters comprehend this?\n\nSima Qian, in compiling the histories of the various schools, placed Dao and virtue first—this may be called understanding root and branch. Ban Gu, in composing the *Table of Ancient and Modern Personages*, demoted Laozi to the third rank. Though his name may be mocked, can his Dao truly be denigrated?\n\nAlas, Laozi’s teachings have long been discarded in his own era—this is the doing of those few masters. Moreover, Confucius personally met Laozi and sighed, saying his Dao was \"like a dragon.\" He followed him to inquire about ritual without finding fault—this is recorded in the annals. Later generations could not fathom his intent, giving rise to heterodox theories. Those who transmitted his teachings did not exhaust their source, so those who opposed them did not grasp their subtleties.\n\nAlas, if this transmission had not been made, Laozi’s intent might have nearly vanished. Now, I have thoroughly explored its subtleties and revealed its profundities, making it clearly harmonize with the intentions of the multitude of sages. Those who can embody his Dao, employ his names, grasp the ancient to steer the present—achieving order will be as easy as turning one’s palm.\n\nAmong those who have spoken of Laozi’s teachings, only the Grand Historian [Sima Qian] came close.",

Profound and again profound—\nThe gate of all mysteries.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe Dao is the essence; the name is its function. Function arises from essence, yet essence is originally without function. Names are established by the Dao, yet the Dao is originally without name.\nEssence is originally without function, so no function is impossible—hence it is said, \"can be spoken.\" What can be spoken refers to essence fulfilling function. Essence fulfilling function is the principle of things, not the constancy of the Dao—hence it is said, \"not the constant Dao.\"\nThe Dao is originally without name, so no name is impossible—hence it is said, \"can be named.\" What can be named refers to seeking essence through name. Seeking essence through name is the transformation of things, not the constancy of names—hence it is said, \"not the constant name.\"\nThe so-called constant Dao and constant name are not the Dao that \"can be spoken\" or the name that \"can be named.\" Why? The constant Dao and constant name cannot be spoken and cannot be named; only by understanding the discourse on essence and function can one profoundly penetrate their ultimate depths.\nThus, one who embodies the Dao is the Sovereign, who follows the principles of things. One who employs names is the Emperor, who adapts to the transformations of things. Following principles and adapting to transformations, descending to ascend—such a one is the King.\nTherefore, those who attain it supremely become spirits; those who attain it moderately become sages; those who attain it minimally become wise; those who attain it partially become worthies; and those who do not attain it become the common people.\nThe so-called nameless is the essence of the Dao, prior to movement and stillness. The named is the function of the Dao, the origin of good and evil.\nEssence is the root of names, thus it transcends movement and stillness—tracing it back, it is the beginning of heaven and earth. Names arise from function, thus they generate good and evil—pushing it to the limit, it is the mother of the myriad things.\nThus, the Sovereign upholds the nameless, while the Emperor practices the named. Upholding the nameless, one acts without acting and yet nothing is left undone. Practicing the named, one acts yet does not rely on action.\nThe Sovereign follows the principles of things, responding to their lack of desire by maintaining clarity and stillness—hence it is said, \"always without desire, observe its mystery.\" Mystery refers to stillness illuminating principle, the subtly profound and profoundly penetrating.\nThe Emperor adapts to the transformations of things, responding to their desires by acting with restraint and pattern—hence it is said, \"always with desire, observe its manifestations.\" Manifestations refer to movement illuminating affairs, where divergent paths converge as one.\nThe so-called \"these two\" refer to the beginning and the mother, that is, the arts of the nameless and the named—emerging from the same essence yet differing in function.\nThe profound is that which illuminates both affairs and principle. One who knows the subtly profound and profoundly penetrating art of the nameless, and the art of the named where divergent paths converge as one—using stillness to control transformation, movement to return to the root, so that movement and stillness are not distinct—then affairs and principle profoundly converge.\nWhen affairs and principle profoundly converge, things cannot burden one. Thus, one retreats and hides in secrecy, sharing fortune and misfortune with the people, yet the drumming of the world does not share the sage’s concerns—this is the utmost profundity of the spirit.\nEmerging, one becomes the multitude; entering, one becomes the mystery. There is nothing that does not proceed from this Dao.\n\n**Classic:**\nWhen all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, not-goodness arises.\nThus, being and non-being produce each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short shape each other,\nHigh and low incline toward each other,\nSound and voice harmonize with each other,\nFront and back follow each other.\nTherefore, the sage abides in the affairs of non-action and practices the teaching without words.\nThe myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them,\nHe gives them life yet does not possess them,\nHe acts yet does not rely on them,\nHis work is accomplished yet he does not dwell in it.\nIt is precisely because he does not dwell that it does not depart.\n\n**Commentary:**\nWhat people call beauty and ugliness all arise from emotion. Adapting to emotion is beauty; opposing emotion is ugliness. The same applies to utmost goodness and not-goodness.\nYet what is deemed beautiful is not necessarily beautiful; what is deemed ugly is not necessarily ugly. What is deemed good is not necessarily good; what is deemed not-good is not necessarily not-good. Why is this? Emotion causes it.\nHuman nature is largely the same, but emotions differ. When divergent emotions are externally stirred by things, likes and dislikes become entangled, and beauty and ugliness lack a foundation—how can they be rectified? It lies in returning to nature.\nFormerly, what emotions give rise to must originate from nature. Thus, the sage transforms emotion to return to nature, reaching great unity.\nThe so-called \"being and non-being producing each other\" refers to emotion and nature. The mutual dependence of emotion and nature is like difficulty and ease completing each other.\nIn governance, if emotion disorders nature, it is difficult to succeed; if nature rectifies emotion, it is easy to succeed.\nThe so-called \"long and short shaping each other\" refers to beauty and ugliness. The mutual contention of beauty and ugliness is like high and low inclining toward each other.\nThe so-called \"sound and voice harmonizing with each other\" refers to goodness and not-goodness. The mutual reliance of goodness and not-goodness is like front and back following each other.\nAlas, the world’s many troubles arise from these six. This is why all under heaven is not well-governed, and the myriad things cannot fulfill their natures.\nThe sage, wishing to restore their natures, first transforms their emotions.",

When things are governed, there is no evil; when people are taught, there is none ungood—yet the world still remains ungoverned.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nIts Dao is most vast, and nothing is left to waste.\nThis is what is spoken of.\n\nThus, the sage embodies the formless Dao and acts without doing, yet affairs are naturally settled.\nThey employ the named Dao and speak not, yet teaching

artisans crafting tools yet not relying on their completion,\nlike the four seasons fulfilling their yearly tasks yet not dwelling on their results.\n\nOnly thus can their Dao be constant, and their name never fade.\n\nThe Canon states:\nDo not exalt the worthy, lest the people contend;\nDo not prize hard-to-obtain goods, lest the people become thieves;\nDo not display what is desirable, lest the

states:\nThe Dao is boundless yet employed—\nsometimes it does not overflow.\nDeep as the source of all things.\n\nIt blunts the sharp, resolves the tangled,\nharmonizes the bright, aligns with the dust,\nsettles as if it might exist.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nit precedes the Emperor.\n\nThe Transmission says:\nThe Dao’s essence is its true substance,\nits boundlessness is its function.\nAll under heaven turns to it, yet it never overflows;\nit is the source of all things, its depths unfathomable.\n\nTo grasp its function is to blunt the harshness of worldly desires,\nto resolve the entanglements of worldly affairs.\nTo embody its essence is to harmonize the luminous without brilliance,\nto align with the dust without obscurity.\nThough settled beyond measure, it endures like existence—\nthus first it is likened to \"as if,\" and later to \"as if it exists.\"\n\nI cannot finally know its origin—\nit is like the One before heaven and earth were born.\n\nThe Canon states:\nHeaven is long, Earth is enduring.\nHeaven and Earth endure long because they do not generate themselves—\nthus they can long endure.\n\nTherefore, the sage follows his own body yet his body precedes,\nsets it aside yet his body remains.\nIs it not because of their lack of self-interest?\nThus they achieve their own ends.\n\nThe Transmission says:\nHeaven and Earth produce myriad things yet do not generate themselves—\nthus they endure without decay,\nlast forever without ceasing.\nThe people rely on the sage for governance,\nyet the sage does not depend on the people.\n\nIt is like the ritual sacrifice (*chúdǎo*) relying on divine illumination to complete,\nyet the divine illumination has no use for the sacrifice.\nOnly when there is no use is there no partiality,\nand when there is no partiality, no favoritism.\nThus, Heaven and Earth, though without favor, generate great favor,\nand the sage, though not \"仁\" (*rén*), achieves great \"仁.\"\nTherefore, the people do not refuse virtue from the sage,\nand myriad things do not withhold life from Heaven and Earth.\n\nHow do I know this to be true?\nI observe between Heaven and Earth—\nit is like the bellows (*tuóqiào*) without heart.\nThe bellows, without heart, thus its sound does not tire,\nits breath ever emerges.\nHeaven and Earth, without heart, thus they generate and complete without ceasing,\nand governance does not require much speaking.\nMuch speaking without reverence leads to exhaustion—\nit is better to attend to affairs of non-action,\nto practice teaching that requires no words.\n\nThis

female?\nTo be clear and all-pervading—\ncan one be without knowledge?\nTo give birth and nurture—\nto give birth yet not possess,\nto act yet not rely,\nto grow yet not dominate—\nthis is called the mysterious virtue.\n\n**Commentary:** *Load* means \"husband,\" the beginning of speech.\nThe *spirit* is the start of life.\nThe *One* is the child of the Dao.\nTo nurture the beginning, to embrace the child—\nthen spirit and form do not separate.\nTo focus on the harmonious and gentle,\nto achieve a tranquil mind—\nthen nature and vital breath are like an infant.\nTo cleanse the heart and abandon perception—\nwhat thought, what worry—\nthen the Dao and virtue are without blemish.\nTo love the people as one’s own children,\nto govern the state as a small fresh fish—\neach corrects

oneself,\nthe latter three for governing the state.\nTo cultivate for oneself, its virtue is true;\nto cultivate for the world, its virtue is universal.\nThus, only in this way\ncan one give birth and

use.\n\n**Commentary:** What is above form is called the Dao,\nwhat is below form is called the instrument.\nThe Dao uses *not-being* for its function,\nthe instrument uses *being* for its advantage.\nYet what is has its advantage only because of what is not,\nwhat is not has its use only because of what is.\nThus, the cart has spokes and hub to symbolize Heaven,\nthe room has doors and windows to symbolize Earth—\nthe cart and room’s full advantage\nalways lies in their emptiness,\nis this not like the space between Heaven and Earth?\nAs for shaping clay into vessels,\ntheir utility

other choice.\nLater generations failed to grasp his intent,\nand so claimed his teachings conflicted with Confucius—\nthis is the case here and in the following chapter.\nAlas, the Master Lao has been maligned for so long—\nnow I clarify and illuminate his words.\n\nDoes not the *Records* say:\nWhen the Great Dao prevails,\npeople do not merely love their own kin,\nnor merely cherish their own children.\nThey abhor wealth discarded upon the earth,\nyet do not hoard it for themselves;\nthey abhor strength unused in service,\nyet do not claim it for themselves alone.\nThus, deceitful plots do not arise,\nbandits and rebels do not act,\nouter doors remain unbarred—\nthis is called *Dàtóng* (Great Harmony).\nAt such times,\npeople draw water from wells,\ntill fields for food,\nrise with the sun and rest with the setting—\nwhat power does the Sage exert over them?\nThe common folk merely recognize its existence—\nhow could benevolence and righteousness intervene?\n\nWhen the Great Dao is obscured,\npeople love only their own kin,\ncherish only their own children,\nhoard wealth and strength for themselves,\nand employ benevolence and righteousness to govern—\nto rectify the relations of ruler and subject,\nto strengthen father and son,\nto harmonize brothers,\nto unite husband and wife.\nThe people cherish and praise them,\nand thus benevolence and righteousness become prominent.\nFrom this perspective,\nwhen simplicity scatters into tools,\nis it not the case that when the Great Dao is abandoned,\nbenevolence and righteousness arise?\nHence, Confucius sighed at the *Zhuō Bīn* banquet,\nwhile the Master Lao expounded in *Dàodé Jīng*—\ntheir intent was one and the same.\n\nThe Sage’s wisdom encompasses all things yet does not adorn conduct,\nhis enlightenment benefits the world yet does not flaunt righteousness.\nAt such times, people do not yet recognize wisdom as wisdom.\nAs the age declines and contention spreads,\nmen use wisdom to conceal deceit,\nuse enlightenment to undermine righteousness—\nthen the arts of wisdom become apparent,\nwhile the traces of deceit are concealed.\nIs it not so that wisdom arises, yet great deceit follows?\n\nThus, the *Two Observances* condemned Zhòng Zhèng Mào,\nand the *Spring and Autumn Annals* recorded the treachery of Chu Zǐ Qián—\nthen how different were Confucius’ intentions from those of the Master Lao?\n\nAs for the Way of father and son,\nit is innate human nature.\nFollowing nature’s harmony,\nparents and children naturally grow close—\nwho would know filial piety and kindness?\nYet when external influences seduce,\nnature transforms into emotion,\nand when questioned, some stray from their innate nature.\nThe Sage cultivates the Dao as teaching to harmonize the world,\nso that parents and children mutually love one another,\nand the names of filial piety and kindness become prominent—\nthus it is said: *When six kinds of kin are discordant, filial piety and kindness emerge.*\nHence, even though the blind historian was dull-witted,\nShun was called a great filial son;\nthough Zēng Zhè was stern,\nZǐ Sān was praised for his filial care—\nthis is the inevitable principle.\nHow could the Master Lao oppose it?\n\nWhen a flying dragon soars in the sky,\nvirtuous men occupy high positions,\nand ministers support the ruler without obstruction—\nthen loyal ministers do not appear.\nBut when the ruler above is benighted\nand the people below are in chaos,\nonly then do ministers risk their lives for the state,\nutter words that grieve the heart and offend the ear—\nthus it is said: *When states fall into chaos, loyal ministers appear.*\nHence, when Jiè of Xia was enthroned,\nLóng Féng’s loyalty shone forth;\nwhen Jǐn of Shang perished,\nBǐ Gān’s defiance emerged—\nthese are actions taken when there is no other choice—\nhow could the Master Lao oppose them?\n\nIf scholars grasp his intent,\nthen the methods of Confucius and Lao are not in conflict.\n\n**Scripture says:**\nAbandon the Sage, discard wisdom—\nthe people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness—\nthe people return to filial piety and kindness.\nAbandon cleverness, discard profit—\nthieves and robbers vanish.\nThese three are insufficient as doctrine,\nso they are assigned their proper place.\nEmbrace simplicity, hold fast to purity,\nreduce private desires and few wants.\n\n**Commentary says:**\nThe Sage’s wisdom benefits creatures,\nyet some suffer harm from its use—\nthus blame is wrongly placed upon the Sage’s wisdom,\nand some say to abandon and discard it,\nso that the people’s benefit may increase a hundredfold.\nBenevolence and righteousness harmonize the people,\nyet some incur resentment from their use—\nthus blame is wrongly placed upon benevolence and righteousness,\nand some say to abandon and discard them,\nso that the six kinds of kin may be harmonized.\nCleverness and profit aid people,\nyet some turn to theft from their use—\nthus blame is wrongly placed upon cleverness and profit,\nand some say to abandon and discard them,\nso that robberies and assaults may cease.\n\nHarm and benefit arise together,\nlike form and shadow inseparable—\nnatural principles cannot be extinguished.\nSome, blinded by the decay of the age,\nfail to perceive how decay begets renewal—\nthey say to abandon and discard,\nso as to return to ancient beginnings—\nthis is like hating shadows yet unaware that light requires darkness,\nand thus seeking to erase form itself.\n\nThe Master Lao lamented that people had long strayed from the Dao,\nand refuted these erroneous arguments,\nclaiming that doctrine alone is insufficient to govern—\nthus he especially emphasized these three,\nclarifying that this was not his intent.\n\nI differ.\nThe Sage’s wisdom is the master of crafted tools.\nBenevolence and righteousness are the virtues of social relations.\nCleverness and profit are the skills of artisans.\nIf their use becomes corrupt,\nI must adjust and rectify them—\nthis is the principle: *Decay begets renewal*,\nthe constant way to rescue what is flawed.\n\nThus, the method of rectification is to assign them their proper place—\nto still the turbid with quiet patience,\nto move the settled with gentle action.\nBy guiding transformation gradually,\npeople

**spontaneity**.\nHow do I know that all **spontaneity** is thus?\nBy this.\n\n**Transmission:**\nThe **virtue** of emptiness and space\nEncompasses all things—\nIt follows only the **Dao** of true **qi**.\nYet the **Dao** as a thing—\nVague as if it exists,\nElusive as if it does not,\nCannot be fixedly spoken of.\nHow so?\nFor it is **stillness** and **void** without form,\nUnable to be grasped as existing yet manifesting myriad forms,\nOr as **thousand transformations and ten thousand changes**,\nUltimately returning to **nothingness**.\nThough vague and elusive, existing and non-existing are indeterminate,\nDeep and dark, yin and yang are unfathomable,\nYet the **faith** of true **qi** abides between them.\n\nWhen **pure** and **unadulterated**, it is called **qi**;\nWhen **spontaneous**, it is called **true**;\nWhen **utter sincerity**, it is called **faith**.\nThus, **utter sincerity** is its function,\n**Pure qi** is its **body**;\nWhen **body** and function merge mysteriously,\nIt is called **spontaneous**—\nThe **Dao** follows **spontaneity**.\n\nHow do I know that **spontaneity** is true?\nFor its name, from ancient times to the present,\nEndures as the **Dao**—\nIts name never departs.\nBecause its name never departs,\nIt can observe and encompass all **spontaneity**.\n\n**Spontaneity** refers to those who observe and encompass all things’ **spontaneity**.\nHow do I know that all things’ names can be observed?\nFor all things’ names are not fixed names,\nThus their names change with the world and perish.\nOnly the **Dao**’s enduring name does not vanish,\nThus it can observe names that can be named.\n\nOnly those who know the **Dao**’s name\nCan govern and respond to affairs.\nThough myriad things arise daily before us,\nI alone remain **non-doing** yet govern.\n\n**Scripture:**\nThe crooked becomes whole,\nThe bent becomes straight,\nThe hollow becomes full,\nThe worn becomes new,\nThe few gain,\nThe many are confused.\nThus the Sage embraces **One** as the model for all under heaven.\nNot self-assertive, hence **illuminated**;\nNot self-righteous, hence **manifest**;\nNot self-praising, hence **accomplished**;\nNot self-glorifying, hence **enduring**.\nOnly because he does not contend,\nAll under heaven cannot contend with him.\n\nThe ancients’ saying *\"The crooked becomes whole\"*—\nWas it mere idle talk?\nThus I sincerely affirm it as whole and return to it.\n\n**Transmission:**\nWhen the crooked is fulfilled without omission, affairs are whole;\nWhen one bends himself to extend things, principles become straight.\nWhen desires are few, affairs return to their root—\nThus the hollow becomes full;\nWhen the turbid is still, principles become clear—\nThus the worn becomes new;\nWhen affairs return to principles,\nThus the few gain;\nWhen principles conflict with affairs,\nThus the many are confused.\n\nThe Sage knows the **Dao**’s **laws**,\nEmbraces the **Dao**’s **One**,\nTo harmonize affairs with principles,\nTo harmonize principles with affairs—\nWhen affairs and principles merge in **mystery**,\nThus he can serve as the **Dao**’s pattern for all under heaven.\n\nNot self-assertive yet **illuminating** others,\nNot self-righteous yet **manifesting** truth;\nNot self-praising his talents,\nThus affairs return to reality—\nHence governance achieves **accomplishment**;\nNot self-glorifying his abilities,\nThus principles attain their due—\nHence the **Dao** endures.\n\nOnly by following the **Dao**’s principles,\nNot contending with things,\nAll under heaven’s affairs follow him.\n\nThus he can fulfill all things’ crookedness without omitting the minute and hidden,\nThis is the ancients’ saying *\"The crooked becomes whole\"*—\nWas it mere idle talk?\nIf he can truly fulfill the crookedness,\nThen all under heaven will be whole and return to him.\n\n**Scripture:**\nDesiring few words, **spontaneity** is achieved.\nA gusting wind does not last through the morning,\nA sudden rain does not last through the day.\nWho does this?\nThe heavens and earth.\nHeaven and earth still cannot endure,\nHow much more so for man?\nThus those who practice the **Dao**—\nThe **Dao**-practitioner aligns with the **Dao**,\nThe **virtue**-practitioner aligns with **virtue**,\nThe **loss**-practitioner aligns with **loss**.\nThe **Dao**-practitioner,\nThe **Dao** also attains;\nThe **virtue**-practitioner,\n**Virtue** also attains;\nThe **loss**-practitioner,\n**Loss** also attains.\nThus, **faith** insufficient,\nThere is **unfaith**.\n\n**Transmission:**\nThe Master Lao was about to implement the **teaching of non-speaking**,\nTo align with **spontaneity**’s principles,\nThus he marked and named it.\nThe **Scripture** says:\n*\"Listening yet not hearing\"* is called **few words**.\nThus, **few words** is akin to **non-speaking**.\n\nZhongni said:\n*\"How does the heavens speak?\nThe four seasons proceed in its course,\nThe myriad things are born from it.\"*\nAgain it says:\n*\"The heavens does not speak yet is **faith**-ful.\"*\nThis is the **Dao**’s **spontaneity**.\n\nThe **spontaneity**’s principles\nAre the **Dao**’s constant.\nLike the four seasons’ course,\nThe heavens and earth’s constant,\nThus they endure unceasingly,\nEnding yet beginning anew.\n\nThe gusting wind and sudden rain\nAre not the heavens and earth’s constant,\nThus their arising is abrupt,\nTheir cessation is fleeting.\n\nThough the heavens and earth are vast,\nThey still cannot endure this unnaturalness,\nHow much more so for humanity,\nCan it endure unnaturalness for long?\n\n**Virtue** and **Dao** hidden,\n**Ren** and **yi** not practiced,\n**Ritual propriety** and **punishments** become burdensome—\nThey are done only out of necessity.\nYet the confused cannot know **ritual propriety**,\nTaking **punishments** as the greatest **punishment**,\nAspiring to the **Dao**’s **non-action**,\nYet desiring to grasp one side,\nSaying it can be practiced for **hundred generations**—\nThis is an error.\n\nAh! The gusting wind and sudden rain\nHave their time to cease,\nThe four seasons’ course never ends,\n**Spontaneity**’s principles\nCannot be altered.\n\nThus those who practice the **Dao**\nAre **Dao**-embodiments.\nFollowing **spontaneity**,\nThey do not lose the **Dao**’s constant,\nThus the **Dao** also attains them—\nThey align with the **Dao**.\n\nThose who practice **virtue**\nAre **virtue**-users.\nThough they lose the **Dao**’s constant,\nThey do not lose **virtue**’s constant—\nThus **virtue** also attains them—\nThey align with **virtue**.\n\nThose who practice **loss**\nHave already lost in **virtue** and **Dao**,\nAnd also lost in **Ren** and **yi**,\nThus **loss** also attains them—\nThey align with **loss**.\n\nThe *Records* say:\n*\"Doing good differently, yet all return to **governance**;\nDoing evil differently, yet all return to **chaos**.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Ah, this is nearly true.\n\nAlas, how unreliable is trust when it falters!\nThus, when one is forced to act against their will,\nYet still acts—how deeply confused they are!\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"Those who stand on tiptoe cannot stand firm,\nThose who stride cannot walk steadily.\nThose who see only themselves are blind,\nThose who insist on being right are never clear,\nThose who boast of their own deeds achieve nothing,\nThose who pride themselves in their abilities do not endure.\nAs for the Dao,\nIt is like surplus food or burdensome baggage—\nThings others despise, so those who follow the Dao do not dwell upon them.\"*\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"Those who cling to profit cannot stand firm in the constant Dao,\nThose who straddle desire cannot walk steadily in the constant name.\nIf the roots of desire and profit are not forgotten,\nYet one claims, ‘I can bring governance,’\nThere is no way to do so.\"*\n\nThus, when one obscures others by self-regard, affairs become unclear;\nWhen one contradicts others by self-righteousness, principles are not revealed;\nWhen one boasts of one’s talents, governance yields no fruit;\nWhen one vaunts one’s abilities, the Dao does not endure.\nThese four afflictions share the same malady as tiptoeing and striding—\nNone are sufficient to achieve governance.\n\nIf we speak of the Dao,\nTo discard surplus food is not enough to satisfy hunger,\nTo bear burdensome baggage is exceedingly ugly—\nEven ordinary things are despised, so how can those who follow the Dao dwell upon them?\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"There exists a formless substance,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\nSilent and boundless,\nIt stands alone yet never changes,\nCirculates endlessly yet never falters—\nIt can be the mother of all under Heaven.\nI do not know its name,\nSo I call it the Dao.\nForced to name it, I call it Great.\nGreat means passing,\nPassing means distant,\nDistant means returning.\"*\n\nThus, the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nThe Sage-King is great.\nTherefore, within the realm, there are four greats,\nAnd the Sage-King occupies one of them.\n\nHumans model Earth,\nEarth models Heaven,\nHeaven models the Dao,\nThe Dao models spontaneity.\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*The *Yijing* says: \"The Great Polarity (*Taiji*) is the origin of the Two Principles (*liangyi*).\"\nThus, we know that the formless substance\nWas born before Heaven and Earth.\nSilent and without trace,\nIt stands independent beyond all transformations,\nYet its essence never changes;\nBoundless and formless,\nIt circulates within all things,\nYet its function never falters.\nThus, it can generate all kinds,\nAnd be the master of all affairs.*\n\n*The *Zhongyong* says: \"Its nature is not dual,\nThus its creation of things is unfathomable.\"\nTherefore, the Great Polarity is the beginning of the Great Unfolding (*Taiyuan*),\nAnd the formless substance is the mother of all under Heaven.\nIts essence cannot be named and grasped,\nThus its name is unknown.\nIts function cannot be said to lack a name,\nThus it is called the Dao.\nNames arise from things, and things give rise to names—\nSince we have given it a name, we know it has a name.\nYet tracing its name reveals no clear meaning,\nExamining its function reveals its utmost greatness—\nThus, we forcibly name its function as Great.\nWhen speaking of its function, we call it Great,\nBut when speaking of its essence, it has already passed away.\nHow distant is the name from the reality?\nIt is said: its distance is not far—\nIt lies in knowing its return.\nTo return from name to reality,\nTo return from affairs to principle—\nGreatly applied to family and state,\nSlightly applied to self and mind—\nIf one cannot reflect inwardly, the principle of Heaven is extinguished.\nThus, the *Records* say:\n*\"The Dao is not distant from people;\nPeople distance themselves from the Dao,\nAnd those who distance themselves cannot be the Dao.*\nAgain, it says:\n*\"The Dao cannot be separated for even a moment;\nIf it can be separated, it is not the Dao.\"*\n\nThus, the earlier statement—\n*\"There exists a formless substance,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth\"*—\nIs the nameless Dao.\nThe later statement—\n*\"Passing means distant,\nDistant means returning\"*—\nIs the named Dao.\nTherefore, when the four greats of the realm are raised,\nThe Sage-King occupies one of them,\nTo make clear that the Sage-King participates in Heaven and Earth’s Dao,\nAnd assists in the transformation and nurturing of all things.\n\nAh, the realm’s clouds—\nThis makes clear that the Dao is not beyond the six directions.\nThus, those who rule over people\nShould model Earth’s stillness,\nTo make their essence still;\nThen model Heaven’s movement,\nTo make their function active;\nThen model the Dao’s effortless yet all-accomplishing.\nOnce they can effortlessly yet all-accomplish,\nThen they can model spontaneity,\nAnd all under Heaven will not know how it is done.\n\nThe *Classics* say:\n*\"Substance is the root of the insubstantial,\nStillness is the master of the restless.*\nThus, the virtuous person walks all day without leaving their baggage.\nThough they enjoy splendid sights,\nTheir hearts remain serene and detached.\n\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nLightly cast aside the weight of all under Heaven?\nLightness leads to losing one’s foundation,\nRestlessness leads to losing one’s master.\"\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"All things, though diverse,\nEach return to their roots—\nThus, substance can be the root of the insubstantial.\nAll under Heaven’s movement is steadfast in One—\nThus, stillness can be the master of the restless.*\n\nThose who travel far carry their baggage all day,\nYet never stray far from their heavy loads—\nFor their clothing and food depend upon them.\nIf they abandon it and stray far,\nThey will soon be exhausted and stranded upon the road.\nThus, the virtuous person’s heart always aligns with the Dao,\nThough externally surrounded by dazzling splendor and luxury,\nInternally they remain settled in simplicity,\nSerene and unattached—\nThis is the art of taking substance as root and stillness as master.\n\nThe ruler of ten thousand chariots\nDoes so because all under Heaven is their burden.\nHow can they lightly use their body without regard for all under Heaven?\nLightness leads to losing the foundation of national stability,\nRestlessness leads to losing Earth’s masterly stillness.\n\nThe people are the root of the state—\nIf the root is firm, the state is at peace.\nThis is the constant way of all sovereigns.\nTo cherish them brings loyalty,\nTo harm them brings vengeance—\nThis is the constant sentiment of all under Heaven.\n\nIf those who rule over people\nLightly use their bodies,\nIndulge desires without restraint,\nOppress the people,\nAnd disregard all under Heaven,\nThen the people will abandon them in droves.\nNot only will they abandon them,\nBut they will rise to harm them as well.\n\nThus, the Old Master, moved with pity,\nRepeatedly sighed and said:\n*\"To govern the self and mind,\nLightness leads to losing the return to root,\nRestlessness leads to losing steadfast unity.\nTo govern all under Heaven,\nLightness leads to losing the foundation of national peace,\nRestlessness leads to losing Earth’s masterly stillness.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Ah, O Sovereign of the myriad chariots,\nHow can you not be weighty and tranquil?\n\n**Scripture:**\nThe skilled traveler leaves no tracks,\nThe skilled speaker leaves no flaws to censure,\nThe skilled strategist needs no reckoning tools,\nThe skilled guardian needs no locks yet cannot be opened,\nThe skilled binder needs no cords yet cannot be undone.\n\nThus, the Sage always excels in saving people,\nSo there are none abandoned;\nAlways excels in saving things,\nSo there are none discarded—\nThis is called *clinging to clarity*.\n\nTherefore, the virtuous become teachers for the unvirtuous,\nAnd the unvirtuous become resources for the virtuous.\nTo not honor one’s teacher,\nTo not cherish one’s resource—\nThough one may know much, it is utter confusion—\nThis is called the supreme subtlety.\n\n**Transmission:**\nThe skilled traveler acts through the Dao.\nThe Dao is vast, so virtue spreads broadly—\nThus, no tracks remain to follow.\nThe skilled speaker relies on *name*.\nWhen *name* is correct, reality is attained—\nThus, no flaws exist to censure.\nThe skilled strategist relies on *measure*.\nWhen *measure* is clear, calculations are simple—\nThus, no reckoning tools are needed, yet intricate calculations are achieved.\nThe skilled guardian seals the *mouth* (of excess),\nSo the mind does not stir—\nThus, no locks are needed, yet it cannot be breached.\nThe skilled binder binds with *truth*,\nSo the mind does not stray—\nThus, no cords are needed, yet it cannot be undone.\n\nHence, the *Records* say:\nBefore mourning was practiced among the people,\nThe people mourned;\nBefore reverence was practiced among the people,\nThe people revered.\nThe Yin made oaths, and the people began to rebel;\nThe Zhou held assemblies, and the people began to doubt.\nIf one lacks the loyal, sincere, and grieving heart to govern,\nEven the most firmly bound people will not remain steadfast.\n\nThus, these five skills are all the Sage’s essential methods of salvation.\n\nAs for people’s unvirtue—\nWhat is there to abandon?\n\nTherefore, the Son of Heaven establishes the Three Dukes,\nTo teach them.\nTo the virtuous, I am virtuous;\nTo the unvirtuous, I am also virtuous—\nThus, teaching abandons no one,\nAnd use discards nothing—\nThis is the subtle art of *knowing the constant*,\nHence called *clinging to clarity*.\n\nWhy?\nWhat the world values most is the teacher,\nWhat the world cherishes most is the resource—\nYet the virtuous become teachers for the unvirtuous\nPrecisely because the unvirtuous become resources for the virtuous.\nIf there were no unvirtuous as resources,\nThe virtuous would have no one to teach.\n\nAlas, when all under Heaven know virtue as virtue,\nThat is unvirtue;\nWhen all under Heaven do not know virtue as virtue,\nThat is perfect virtue.\n\nNow, those who do not honor their teachers\nDo not wish to conform to what the multitude calls virtuous,\nBut to display what is unvirtuous;\nThose who do not cherish their resources\nDo not wish to use others’ unvirtue to perfect their own virtue.\n\nThough one may know these words on dishonoring and disdaining teachers and resources\nAre greatly misguided for the age,\nTheir essence is the subtle art of salvation—\nThe supreme refinement of method.\n\n**Scripture:**\nKnow the *heroic* and hold to the *receptive*—\nThus, you become the valley of the world.\nTo be the valley of the world,\nYour virtue remains unchanging—\nReturning to the infant.\nKnow the *white* and hold to the *black*—\nThus, you become the model of the world.\nTo be the model of the world,\nYour virtue does not err—\nReturning to the boundless.\nKnow the *honored* and hold to the *humiliated*—\nThus, you become the valley of the world.\nTo be the valley of the world,\nYour virtue is complete—\nReturning to the uncarved.\n\nThe uncarved scatters to become things;\nThe Sage uses them to become officials and leaders—\nThus, the great measure

the *receptive*—\nThus, he can become the valley of the world.\n\nThe valley is used through its lowliness.\nOnly by embracing lowliness\nDoes virtue never depart.\nWhen virtue does not depart,\nOne can align with the Dao—\nThus, returning to the infant,\nCalm as if without knowledge.\nOnly by having no knowledge\nDoes the mind become clear.\nThough one knows it is clear,\nYet guarding it in

knows it is honored and bright,\nYet guarding it with the muddled and humiliated—\nThus, one can become the valley of the world.\n\nThe *valley* is substantial in being yet empty in use.\nOnly by being substantial in being and empty in use\nIs virtue fully sufficient.\nWhen virtue is fully sufficient,\nOne can return to the nameless uncarved—\nAlso, one will have no desires.\n\nAh! The Great Dao is abandoned, and *ren* and *yi* arise;\nThe Great Uncarved scatters into things.\nThe Sage uses these things,\nThus becoming the leader of the multitude.\nOnly the Great Dao, not being a thing,\nCan use these formed things;\nThe great measure, not being cut,\nCan govern the myriad things.\nIf one is not immersed in the Dao yet wishes to use the world’s things,\nOr is constrained by things yet wishes to govern the world’s multitude,\nI must see it as perilous.\n\nThe *Records* say:\nProfit and righteousness,\nWisdom and benevolence—\nThese are the tools of the hegemons and kings.\nTo use them—\nHow can one avoid this path?\n\n**Scripture:**\nIf one seeks to take the world and act upon it,\nI see it as inevitable failure.\nThe world is a divine vessel—\nIt cannot be acted upon.\nTo act upon it is to ruin it;\nTo grasp it is to lose it.\n\nThus, things sometimes advance, sometimes follow,\nSometimes exhale, sometimes inhale,\nSometimes strong, sometimes weak,\nSometimes uplifted, sometimes collapsed.",

in killing.\nThose who take pleasure in killing,\nothers will also take pleasure in killing them—\nnot only will others kill them,\nbut Heaven itself will punish them.\nWhy so?\n\nLife is the greatest virtue of Heaven and Earth—\nthose who take pleasure in killing defy Heaven’s virtue.\nIf such men were to prevail in the world,\nthen nearly all people would perish.\n\nHeaven will not aid them,\nand

higher position are honored on the right,\nand thus victory is treated as a funeral rite.\n\nThe conqueror in battle is he who slays many—\nyet he should weep in sorrow for the slain,\nfor victory is treated as a funeral rite.\nThe earlier words spoke of an inauspicious instrument,\nand now it is said that victory is treated as a funeral rite—\nboth are repeated laments,\nfor the cruelty of

would come willingly.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth combine,\nsweet dew descends—\nno one commands it,\nyet it is evenly distributed.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe Dao endures because of its nameless essence.\nThis nameless essence is also called the nameless Uncarved (朴),\nwhose form is exceedingly subtle and minute,\nyet whose Dao is supremely noble and vast—\nthus it becomes the origin of Heaven and Earth,\nand the world dare not enslave it.\nIf lords and kings could guard this nameless Uncarved (朴),\nthen all things would submit in service.\n\nThus, when mountains are high, the wild rams come,\nand when waters are deep, the dragon spirits arrive.\nIf mountains were not high,\nor waters not deep,\neven divine creatures would not come—\nhow much more so for ordinary things?\n\nWhen the central harmonious *qi* of Heaven and Earth combines,\nthen nourishing dew descends upon all things,\nand all things are evenly blessed by its grace—\nnone can command it to be so.\n\nIf lords and

established,\none would also know when to stop—\nto know when to stop is to avoid peril.\n\nThe Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the great seas.\n\n**Explication:**\nBy \"beginning,\" it refers to the nameless.\nOnly the nameless essence can govern the use of names—\nonce names are established,\nthey will wander without restraint.\nThus one must also know when to stop,\nto halt at the proper place—\nnames halt at their proper place,\naffairs halt at their proper principles.\nTo know when to stop and do so,\nis to avoid danger and peril.\n\nThen, what is meant by \"names halt at their proper place\"?\nIt means to fulfill the names—\nthus one follows names to supervise their fulfillment,\nand examines fulfillment to rectify the names.\nWhen names and fulfillment correspond,\nthe state is well-ordered;\nwhen they do not correspond,\nthe state is chaotic.\nNames arise from fulfillment,\nfulfillment arises from names—\nnames and fulfillment give rise to each other,\nyet they also oppose each other—\nthus the sagely ruler uses the *契* (契) to hold names accountable.\n\nNames are the world’s net,\nthe sage’s talisman.\nTo cast the world’s net,\nand wield the sage’s talisman,\nthen the emotions of all things have no place to escape.\n\nThus, to scrutinize names and restore their fulfillment,\nand to examine fulfillment and correct the names,\nthen right and wrong become as clear as white and black.\nThus, to separate them is to make them two,\nto unite them is to make them one—\nright and wrong follow names and fulfillment,\nrewards and punishments follow right and wrong.\nThus, to perceive their forms,\nto achieve their shapes,\nto follow their principles,\nto correct their names—\nthis is why it is said:\n*\"Names are self-appointed,\nthen affairs are self-determined.\"*\n\nOne follows names to appoint them,\nand examines affairs to rectify them.\nThus, when Yao governed the world,\nhe used names—\nhis names were correct,\nand the world was well-ordered.\nWhen Jie governed the world,\nhe also used names—\nhis names were perverse,\nand the world was chaotic.\nThus, names are what the sage holds most dear.\n\nMaster Zhongni said:\n*\"It must be so—\none must correct the names!\"*\nIf names are not corrected,\nthen the ruler will be burdened with cares and labors;\nif the ruler is burdened with cares and labors,\nthen the

overcome others’ violence\nis the strength of one who follows the Dao;\nto uphold softness and conquer one’s own agitation\nis the power of one who possesses virtue.\n\nHe who knows contentment in worldly gains and desires\ndoes not lose his great undertaking—\nthus he is called rich.\nHe who perseveres in benevolence and righteousness\ncan attain great virtue—\nthus he is called one of

      "translated_text": "---\n\n**Explication:**\nThe Dao moves without losing its place—\nthus the body may endure long.\nDeath comes, yet the Way does not perish—\nthus it is called longevity.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe Great Dao flows unrestrained,\nyet it may be found on either side.\nAll things depend upon it for life,\nyet it does not decline to bestow.\nIt fulfills its function yet does not dwell upon it,\nnurturing all things yet claiming no mastery.\n\nEver without desire, it may be called *small*—\nyet when all things return to it without making it their lord,\nit may be called *great*.\n\nTherefore, the Sage never claims to be great,\nand thus he achieves his greatness.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe application of the Great Dao,\nis it not like the virtue of ghosts and spirits?\nIt flows freely, found on left or right.\nIt drifts boundlessly, as if above or before and behind.\n\nAs the mother of all things, it is relied upon for life.\nIn harmony with Heaven and Earth in virtue, its work is easily accomplished.\nBecause its intimacy is supreme, it never denies its virtue.\nBecause its magnitude is absolute, it never claims its deeds.\n\nIt cherishes all creatures, fostering them without slaughter,\nthus ever without desire, observing its marvel—\nthen its simplicity may be named *small*.\nAll things return to it without making it their sovereign lord,\nlike streams and valleys yielding to rivers and seas—\nthen its Dao may be named *great*.\n\nWhen streams and valleys flow into the rivers and seas,\nthey receive without satiety—\nthis is because they never exalt themselves.\nWhen all under Heaven return to the Sage,\nhe accepts them without weariness—\nthis is because he never claims to be great.\n\nThe Sage upholds the humble simplicity of the *small* (undifferentiated),\nyet never considers himself great—\nthus he becomes the guest of all things,\nand ultimately achieves his greatness.\n\n**Explication:**\nHold the Great Image, and all under Heaven will follow.\nFollow yet cause no harm—\nthen peace and tranquility prevail.\n\nJoy and bait,\nyet travelers pass on without lingering.\nThe Way, when spoken of, is bland without flavor.\nTo gaze upon it is insufficient to see,\nto listen to it is insufficient to hear—\nyet its use is never exhausted.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe Great Image is the Way.\nHe who can grasp the ancient Way to govern the present,\nall things under Heaven will return and follow.\n\nThe Sage views the people as tender children,\nfearing to harm them—\nhow much more would he avoid harming them in times of crisis?\nIf he never harms them, then those who return and follow\nwill suffer no injury from him.\n\nIf none suffer injury, then all under Heaven will dwell in ease and tranquility.\nJoy can delight the ear,\nbait can satisfy the palate—\nthen wayfarers will linger, travelers will revel,\nthough they may feel pleasure in the moment,\nyet it is not their true resting place,\nand they cannot remain long.\n\nThus the *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"The bird burns its nest,\nthe wayfarer laughs first, then weeps bitterly.\"*\n\nHe who upholds the Great Image is not thus.\nHe does not display desire for pleasure to the people,\nso when his words leave his mouth, they are bland without flavor;\nwhen his teachings enter the heart, they are serene without adornment.\nThough faint and subtle, they are not sufficient for sight or hearing,\nyet their use is inexhaustible,\ntheir measure never depleted—\nspanning myriad ages without end.\n\n**Explication:**\nHe who would gather must first disperse;\nhe who would weaken must first strengthen;\nhe who would discard must first promote;\nhe who would take away must first give.\nThis is called *subtle enlightenment*.\n\nSoftness overcomes hardness—\nfish cannot escape the depths,\nthe sharpest tools of state\nshould not be displayed to the people.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe Sage’s profound depths are most wondrous in *power and expedience* (权实).\n*Expedience* (权) takes *harmony with nature* (顺常) as its essence,\n*power* (实) employs *contrary measures* (反经) as its function.\n*Expedience* aids *power*,\n*power* implements *expedience*—\nthough they differ in name,\ntheir purpose converges in unity.\n\nThe Master Lao first guided with *power*,\nestablishing the teaching of *constant knowledge*;\nthen he employed *expedience* to aid the people,\nillustrating the principle of *contrary action*.\n\nThis is what the *Classic of Changes* speaks of:\n*\"The bending completes all things without loss,\nthe encompassing contains Heaven and Earth without excess.\"*\n\nTo remove the strong and violent,\nto overturn the obscurantist and cruel—\none must rely upon their hearts of gain and desire,\nand employ the arts of *gathering and dispersing*.\n\nThe use of these arts is thus:\nWhen their hearts of gain and desire are at their peak,\none must indulge them to the fullest, letting them expand.\nThey delight in indulgence, and their true nature is revealed—\nthen one may gather them to bring them to order.\n\nAs in the *Classic of Changes*’ **\"#2\" (明夷)**—\nthe fourth hexagram:\n*\"Entering the left flank, capturing the heart of the obscurantist,\nnot stepping outside the gate.\"*\n\nWhen indulgence is indulged to its utmost,\nthe heart of excess grows ever greater—\nthus it is gathered by all.\n\nThis art is subtle yet clear,\nthe Sage’s hidden means of action.\n\nAs for weakening their resolve and *qi*,\none must first strengthen their cravings and desires.\nGreat love brings great expenditure,\ndesire pushed to its limit weakens the resolve.\n\nSmall use is upon the body and heart,\ngreat use is upon all under Heaven.\nDiscarding and promoting, taking and giving,\nmutually reinforce each other—\nthis is the natural principle,\nwhere *contrary* becomes *harmonious*.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe Way’s motion is *contrary*;\nthe Way’s function is *weakening*.\nTo govern with softness and weakness,\novercoming hardness and strength—\nthis is the *contrary* in use,\nand the *contrary* in use truly governs *expedience*.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"The *submissive* (巽) moves to apply *expedience*.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"The *submissive* is steady when it conforms.\"*\n\nThe *submissive* (巽) as an image is the wind.\nWind responds to the four seasons,\nbending all things—\nyet no one sees its form.\n\n*Expedience* rides the natural course of Heaven,\nadapts to the changes of the world—\nyet no one knows its use.\n\nThe meaning of *submissive* (巽) is *yielding*.\nYielding and submission can apply *expedience*,\nand when *expedience* is applied,\nit can govern the world—\nthus softness and weakness can overcome hardness and strength,\nand the meaning is most evident while the function is most hidden.\n\nHow can this be made clear?\nIn ancient times, King Wen ruled one-third of all under Heaven,\nyet he still bowed and submitted to the tyrant Zhou (纣).\nHe offered the lands of *Lacquer* (漆) and *Stagnant* (沮),\nand requested the abolition of the *Branding* (炮烙) punishment.\n\nWhen Zhou’s greedy heart burned fiercely,\nKing Wen offered the lands—\nthis was indulging them to let them expand.\nZhou, once he gained the lands, rejoiced—\nthus King Wen requested the removal of his punishment,\nthis was gathering them to bring them to order—\nthis was King Wen’s *expedience*.\n\nIn ancient times, King Wu surveyed his troops at the *Ming River Crossing* (盟津),\nsaying, *\"The evil of Zhou has not yet reached its peak.\"*\nThus he returned his army for two years,\nbefore raising the *Mao Field* (牧野) campaign.",

      "translated_text": "「Thus, King Wu’s return to the Ming River Crossing was to fully indulge the tyrant’s arrogance, while his campaign at the Mao Field was to gather the people’s resentment to its extreme—this was King Wu’s *expedience*.\n\nIn ancient times, King Wen, through the Dao of gentle softness, though aware that the Yin people could not endure Zhou’s cruelty, still wished to completely remove Zhou before accepting them—this was King Wen’s *substance*.\n\nKing Wu, through the virtue/power of resolute strength, swiftly recognized that the Yin people could not bear Zhou’s tyranny, and thus hastened to slay Zhou before claiming their lands—this was King Wu’s *substance*.\n\nThe brothers Bo Yi (伯夷) and Shu Qi (叔齐) upheld King Wen’s *substance* and corrected King Wu’s *expedience*, declaring that a subject should not overthrow a sovereign as a precedent. They sought to establish the Three Bonds (三纲) for future generations, thus they collectively abandoned King Wu and starved to death at Shouyang (首阳).\n\nThe Duke of Zhou (太公) aided King Wu’s *expedience* and inverted King Wen’s *substance*, asserting that slaying the tyrannical Zhou would bring peace to the realm. He aimed to rescue the myriad people in the present age, thus he soared like an eagle and followed King Wu, unleashing devastation upon the Great Shang (大商).\n\nThe Duke of Zhou (周公) and the Duke of Shao (召公) completed the deeds of Wen and Wu, intending to secretly preserve the *expedience* of rectifying chaos while openly promoting the *substance* of governance and peace. Thus, they rested the oxen and released the horses, overturned the chariots and laid down the weapons, inquired about the *Great Response* (洪范) from Ji Zi (箕子), relocated the stubborn people to Luoyi (洛邑), established rituals and composed music, laid down arms and cultivated culture, spreading the influence of the Two Southern Schools (二南) and securing the eight-hundred-year prosperity of the Zhou (八百之祚). This was another instance of using *expedience* to invert *substance* on the grandest scale.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* (《易》) states:\n*\"The opening and closing of one gate is called change (变),*\n*and the ceaseless movement between extremes is called harmony (通).\"*\n\nThese are subtle teachings,\nwhereby *expedience* and *substance* complement each other.\n\nAh! The Sage’s use of *expedience* aligns with the Dao,\nwhile the petty man’s misuse of *expedience* serves his deceit.\nA fish that escapes the deep pool cannot swim,\n*Expedience* that departs from *substance* cannot be applied.\n\nFor *expedience* is a sharp instrument of statecraft—\nit must be deeply concealed,\nsecretly employed,\nand never openly displayed,\nlest men seize it to incite disorder.\n\nThus Confucius said:\n*\"One may be capable of following the Dao,*\n*but not yet of establishing it.*\n*One may be capable of establishing it,*\n*but not yet of wielding *expedience*.*\"\n\nIn the *Hexagram of Qian* (□乾) at line four:\n*\"One leaps into the deep pool—*\n*no blame.\"*\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"There is no fixed hierarchy of high and low,*\n*this is not perverse (邪).*\n*There is no constant forward or retreat,*\n*this is not abandonment of the group (离群).*\n*The Noble One advances in virtue/power and cultivates his undertakings,*\n*seeking to fulfill his potential in due time—*\n*thus there is no blame.\"*\n\nIn the *Hexagram of Kun* (《坤》) at line four:\n*\"Gather the sack—*\n*no blame, no praise.\"*\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"When Heaven and Earth undergo transformation,*\n*grasses and trees flourish.*\n*When Heaven and Earth close in stillness,*\n*virtuous men withdraw.*\n*To gather the sack is without blame,*\n*for it signifies restraint (谨),*\n*and caution (慎) does no harm.*\n\nThus, the use of *expedience* is something the Sage finds difficult and cautious—\nhow can it not be guarded with care?\nHow can it not be guarded with care?\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The Dao endures without action,*\n*yet nothing remains undone.*\n*If lords and kings can uphold*\n*this art of the Origin and the Mother,*\n*all things shall naturally transform.*\n*When transformation is complete,*\n*I shall govern with the nameless simplicity (无名之朴).*\n*The nameless simplicity,*\n*too, shall not desire action.*\n*Without desire, it remains tranquil—*\n*thus the realm shall naturally rectify itself.\"*\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"The Dao endures as constant*\n*because its essence is nameless,*\n*thus it acts without action,*\n*and its function is named,*\n*thus it accomplishes all things without omission.*\n*If lords and kings can uphold*\n*this art of the Origin and the Mother,*\n*then the principles of all things shall be attained,*\n*and the affairs of the realm shall be set right—*\n*this is what is meant by*\n*'I act without action, yet the people transform themselves.'*\n\nOnce virtue/power and transformation become pure,\nthe realm attains clarity and tranquility.\nIf the emotions of profit and desire begin to sprout,\nI shall firmly establish and rectify this great Dao\nwith its fundamental simplicity,\nso that nothing may stir them.\n\nThe *Highest Virtue* (上德) acts without action,\nyet nothing is left undone—\nthus it aligns with the Dao.\nThe *Lower Virtue* (下德) acts with action,\nyet something is left undone—\nthus it aligns with virtue/power.\n\nThose who attain virtue/power\nmust inevitably lose the Dao,\nthus one who has the heart of non-action\nshall naturally display the traces of non-action.\nFuture generations shall seek its traces\nwhile forgetting its root—\nthus they arrive at non-action\nyet fall into action.\nHence it is said:\n*'The nameless simplicity,*\n*too, shall not desire action'*\n—meaning to make both heart and trace forgotten,\nthus reaching the *Mysterious of Mysteries* (玄之又玄).\n\nIf one can forget both heart and trace,\nand harmonize with the mysterious principles,\nthen all under Heaven shall naturally fulfill their true nature,\nand bear no burden from the traces of things.\n\nThe first chapter takes the constant Dao as its essence,\nconstant names as its function,\nand culminates in the *Triply Mysterious* (重玄).\nThis chapter takes non-action as its essence,\nand the fulfillment of all things as its function,\nunifying them in the principle of *comprehensive forgetting* (兼忘).\nThe beginning and end are interconnected,\nthus exhausting its essence and function.\n\n*Transmission of the True Dao/Virtue Classic, Volume II ends.*\n#1 *\"亦将不欲\"* (亦将不欲): The original text had three additional characters *\"於不欲\"* (於不欲)* after this sentence, which have been deleted according to the Zhi Hai edition.\n#2 *\"若在其前后\"* (若在其前后): Possibly a corruption, should be *\"若在乎下\"* (若在乎下).\n\n*Transmission of the True Dao/Virtue Classic, Volume III*\n*Transmitted by Lu Xi Sheng (陆希声) of Wu Commandery (吴郡).*」",

All things rely upon their *principle of life*—\nif they rely upon it, the *Heavenly Principle* (天理) will surely perish.\nRulers rely upon steadfastness—\nif they rely upon it, their *nobility and elevation* (貴高) will surely falter.\nThe words *\"nobility and elevation\"* are added to warn of the profound intent for rulers.\n\nThey have both warned and expounded upon it, saying:\n*\"The reason rulers attain nobility and kingship is because they take the lowly as their root,\nthe reason they occupy high positions is because they take the common people as their foundation.\nAs for calling

and merchant\nare the lowly and base of the state—\nthe state’s existence depends upon the lowly and base as its root.\nHence, rulers should warn themselves against nobility,\nnot desiring the brilliance of jade-like splendor,\nbut should take the lowly and base as their root—\nthus, they should be like flint-like stone in their common humility.\n\nThe *Classical* says:\n*\"The contrary is

shunning armor and weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to hurl its horn,\nthe tiger finds no place to strike with its claws,\nthe weapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy so?\nBecause there are no grounds for death within them.\n\n**Scripture:** Life must inevitably meet death—\nthis is the natural order.\nTo grasp the order of life and death,\none must accept it as constant.\n\nIf one defies this order,\nthey stray beyond the bounds of vitality.\nStraying beyond the bounds of vitality,\nthey must inevitably fall into death’s domain.\nYet even so, those who know life’s order\nand do not defy it to preserve their own—\nthree in ten.\nThose who know death’s order\nand do not defy it to avoid death—\nthree in ten as well.\nBut if they love life and defy the order to preserve it,\nthey lose it instead;\nif they hate death and defy the order to avoid it,\nthey gain it instead—\nthe same holds true.\nHow does this come about?\nBecause the pursuit of life’s excess\ntransgresses beyond its natural bounds,\nand thus, when moved from constancy,\nthey are drawn into death’s domain.\n\nHence, the adept at preserving life is different:\nknowing life’s order, they uphold the *Dao* and embrace *virtue*\nwithout indulging in life’s excess;\nknowing death’s order, they find joy in *Heaven’s* ways\nand accept their *fate* without fearing death.\nLife and death cannot sway their heart,\ncalamities cannot shake their resolve,\nso they walk upon land and meet fierce beasts\nwithout alarm,\nenter battle and brave the sharp blades\nwithout flinching—\nthough facing hardship and misfortune alike.\nHow do they achieve this?\nIf one harms with their heart,\nthings will harm them in return;\nif one trusts with their sincerity,\nthings will trust them in return.\nI do not harm with my heart,\nso rhinoceros and tiger find no place to strike with claws or horns;\nI trust with my sincerity,\nso armor and weapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nThus, when life’s order does not dwell within,\ndeath’s domain does not appear before.\n\n*The Master Zhongni* said:\n‘*Loyalty* and *trustworthiness* make even fire and water passable.’\nThis is indeed close to the truth.\n\n**Scripture:** The *Dao* gives birth to them,\n*virtue* nurtures them,\nthings shape their form,\nand *power* completes their function.\nThus, all things revere the *Dao* and honor *virtue*.\nThe *Dao’s* reverence,\nthe *virtue’s* honor—\nnone bestow them upon it,\nyet they arise naturally and everlastingly.\n\nTherefore, the *Dao* gives birth and nurtures,\nlengthens and matures,\nshelters and poisons,\nrears and protects.\nIt gives birth without possession,\nacts without reliance,\nlengthens without control—\nthis is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\n\n**Scripture:** Things are born and then nurtured,\nnurtured and then shaped,\nshaped and then completed.\nThat which gives birth to them is the *Dao*;\nthat which nurtures them is *virtue*;\nthat which shapes their forms is *affairs*;\nthat which completes their function is *power*.\nAll things honor the *Dao* because it gives birth,\nand they revere *virtue* because it nurtures.\nThe *Dao* and *virtue* give birth and nurture,\nso they are naturally revered by all things—\nhow could they be honored only after titles and ranks are conferred?\n\nYet the *Dao* is the essence of the true subtlety,\nand *virtue* is the function of the wondrous.\nThe essence can encompass the function,\nbut the function cannot encompass the essence.\nThe *Dao* can encompass *virtue*,\nbut *virtue* cannot encompass the *Dao*.\nThus, receiving its essence is called *birth*,\nembracing its *qi* is called *nurture*,\nfulfilling its form is called *lengthening*,\nmarking its substance is called *maturing*,\nbalancing its completion is called *sheltering*,\nmeasuring its function is called *poisoning*,\npreserving its harmony is called *rearing*,\nguarding its injury is called *protecting*—\nthis is called the *Great Dao*.\nHaving given birth without clinging to possession,\nhaving acted without boasting of reliance,\nhaving lengthened without controlling—\nthis is called *Mysterious Virtue*.\n\nThe *Chapter of Vital Essence* speaks of how humans align with *Dao* and *virtue*,\nwhile this chapter speaks of how *Dao* and *virtue* align with humans,\nthus their words are similar yet their meaning is unified.\n\n**Scripture:** The world has a beginning,\nwhich we call the *Mother of the World*.\nHaving obtained this *Mother*,\none knows her offspring.\nHaving known the offspring,\none returns to guard the *Mother*—\nthus, one’s body remains unharmed through life’s end.\n\n**Scripture:** The world’s myriad things indeed have a beginning,\nand the beginning of all things—\nis it not the *Nameless*?\nAll things indeed have a source,\nand the source that gives birth to all—\nis it not the *Named*?\nThus, the *Nameless* is the world’s beginning,\nand the *Named* is all things’ *Mother*.\nThe *Nameless* and the *Named* exist in essence and function,\nfor function arises from essence,\nso the *Nameless* is also the *Mother* of the *Named*.\n\nTherefore, it is said:\n‘The world has a beginning,\nwhich we call the *Mother of the World*’—\nthis is the *Dao* giving birth to One.\nOne is the *Dao’s* offspring,\nthe *Dao* is One’s *Mother*.\nThe *Dao* refers to the essence of true subtlety,\nand One refers to the function of wondrous things.\nHaving obtained its essence,\none knows its function.\nHaving obtained its function,\none returns to guard its essence.\nWhen essence and function merge as One,\nresponding to stimuli without end,\nthen one can govern without action—\nthus, one’s body remains unharmed through life’s end.\n\n**Scripture:** Seal its *mouth* (兑),\nshut its *path*,\nand one will never tire through life’s end.\nOpen its *mouth*,\ncomplete its *affairs*,\nand one will never be saved through life’s end.\nSeeing what is small is called *clarity*,\nguarding what is soft is called *strength*.\nUsing its *light*,\nthen returning to its *clarity*—\nleaving no harm to one’s body,\nthis is called *following the constant*.\n\n**Scripture:** The *mouth* is where desires take root.\nThe *path* is where actions arise.\nWith nature rectifying emotions,\nthe source of desires is sealed;\nwith principle governing affairs,\nthe path of actions is closed.\nThus, one can act without doing,\nand do without acting—\nso one never tires through life’s end.\n\nOpening the source without sealing it,\none lengthens the desires of the emotions;\nunblocking the path without closing it,\none completes the affairs of actions.\nThus, form and spirit both labor,\nand one will never be saved through life’s end.\n\nKnowing the art of sealing the *mouth* and closing the *path*,\nthis is called seeing the *minute* and *small*;\ndulling the sharpness of desires,\ndissolving the confusion of actions—\nthis is called guarding the *soft* and *weak*.\nGuarding the *soft* and *weak*,\nthings cannot overpower one—\nthis is called *strength*.\nSeeing the *minute* and *small*,\naffairs cannot be muddled—\nthis is called *clarity*.\n*Clarity* refers to inner vision (essence),\nand *light* refers to outward radiance (function).\"",

*Transmission* says:\nThose who know the Dao act with the heart, not with argument;\nthose who discuss the Dao use argument, not the heart.\nThus, the great man abandons these arguments,\ntakes this heart-awakening,\nblocks the roots of cravings,\nshuts the path of false pretenses,\nblunts the edge of worldly passions,\nuntangles the knots of worldly schemes,\nabove harmonizes the radiance without glare,\nbelow aligns with the dust without obscurity—\nthis is called *subtle, mysterious, and all-pervasive*,\nin great harmony with all things.\n\nIn high company, he does not flatter—\nthus, he cannot be too familiar.\nIn low company, he does not degrade—\nthus, he cannot be too distant.\nModest and yielding, he does not contend—\nthus, he cannot be exploited or harmed.\nIn high station, he does not weigh heavily—\nthus, he cannot be overly honored.\nIn low station, he does not soil himself—\nthus, he cannot be debased.\nHis virtue and power are self-noble,\nnot made so by others—\nthis is why he is the world’s supreme nobility.\n\nThe *Scripture* says:\n*\"Rule with rectitude, act with the unexpected,*\n*conquer the world with non-action.\"*\nHow do I know this is so?\n\nWhen the world is filled with taboos,\nthe people grow poorer.\nWhen the people have many tools,\nthe state grows corrupt.\nWhen the people are clever,\nwicked deeds multiply.\nWhen laws proliferate,\nthieves abound.\nThus, the Sage says:\n*\"I act with non-action, and the people transform themselves;\nI do nothing, and the people grow rich;\nI love stillness, and the people become upright;\nI desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"To name correctly is to avoid excess—\nthis can govern the state.\"*\n*\"To use the unexpected is to avoid exhaustion—\nthis can employ the army.\"*\nThese two talents suffice to remedy disasters,\nbut they are not enduring or grand.\nWhat endures and is grand\nis nothing more than winning the world’s heart.\nTo truly win the world’s heart,\nnothing surpasses *non-action*—\nonce action begins,\nit is no longer sufficient to win the world’s heart.\nHow do I know this is so?\n\nWhen the world has affairs,\ntaboos and prohibitions multiply,\nintended to govern the people.\nThe people, seeing these affairs,\ncannot settle into their work—\nthus, they grow poorer.\nWhen the people have desires,\ntools and instruments multiply,\nintended to aid the state.\nYet the state, with its desires,\ncannot maintain stillness in governance—\nthus, it grows corrupt.\nWhen the people are clever,\nthis is to prevent deceit—\nyet deceit grows more cunning—\nthus, wicked deeds multiply.\nWhen laws proliferate,\nthis is to prevent crime—\nyet criminals find more ways—\nthus, thieves abound.\nAll these are attempts to dam the flow\nwithout blocking the source—\nthus, the harm grows worse and cannot be stopped.\n\nSince action cannot win the world’s heart,\nit is known that only *non-action* can.\nThus, the Master of Lao cites the Sage’s words,\nnot daring to claim them as his own—\nhis cited words are from the *Three Containers*.\nThe Master of Lao, as Keeper of Records beneath the Zhou pillars,\nsurveyed the remnants of ancient texts,\nthus citing them to confirm their necessity.\n\nThe *Transmission*’s preface says:\n*\"He wove together the teachings of the Yellow Emperor.\"*\nThis is of the same kind.\n\nIf I act with non-action,\nthe people follow their nature—\nthus, their customs transform themselves.\nIf I do nothing,\nthe people return to their work—\nthus, their households grow rich.\nIf I love stillness,\nthe people preserve their true nature—\nthus, their affairs become upright.\nIf I desire nothing,\nthe people abandon pretension—\nthus, their nature returns to simplicity.\nIf one has affairs and desires,\nyet hopes to bring the people to wealth and longevity,\nI have never seen it possible.\n\nThe *Scripture* says:\n*\"When governance is dim and broad,*\n*the people are pure and simple;\nwhen governance is sharp and probing,*\n*the people grow weary and depleted.*\n*Disaster, oh disaster—*\n*where fortune hides;\nfortune, oh fortune—*\n*where disaster lurks.*\nWho knows their end?\nPerhaps there is no rectitude.\nRectitude becomes the unexpected,\ngoodness becomes ominous—\nthe people have long been confused in their days.\"*\n\nThe *Transmission* says:\nThe ruler who follows the Dao\ngoverns with dim, broad, inclusive tolerance—\nthe people delight in life and follow their nature,\nthus, they return to simplicity and sincerity.\nThe ruler without virtue\ngoverns with sharp, clever, and harsh measures—\nthe people lose their livelihood and abandon their roots,\nthus, they grow weary and depleted.\nThus, dim governance, which the world calls *slack*,\nbrings true joy to the people;\nsharp governance, which the world calls *competent*,\nbrings true ruin to the people.\nJust as the world’s so-called disasters\nare all feared and hated—\nbecause they are feared and hated,\nfortune lies within them.\nAnd the

strength—\nno one can contend, no thing can harm—\nis this not the case that one may *avoid punishment* through it?\n\nTherefore, the *Records* say:\nThe **Dao** is something one cannot for a moment depart from;\nwhat one can depart from is not the **Dao**.\nIf one is not thus **virtuous**,\nhow could one be worthy of the world’s highest honor?\n\nThe **Classic** states:\n**Act without acting**, **do without doing**, **savor without savoring**.\nGreat or small, much or little—\n**respond to resentment with virtue**.\nThe **Commentary** states:\nThose who embody the **Dao** are subtle and profound in their penetration of the world;\nthey **act** in response to the world, yet their root is **non-action**;\nthey **do** in response to the times, yet their essence is **non-doing**;\nthey **savor** in response to things, yet their foundation is **non-savoring**.\n\nThough their **embodiment** may be vast, their **primordial simplicity** (朴) is most minute;\nthough their **use** may be manifold, their **essence** (要) is most sparse.\nTheir **method** lies in **tranquil simplicity** and **stillness**,\nso that they are not bent by the myriad things.\n\nOnly thus may they be **without desire**;\n**without desire**, they are **without self-interest**.\n**Favor** is where **self-interest** resides,\n**resentment** is where **favor** takes root.\nOnly the **Sage** can be **without self-interest**,\n**without self-interest**, they have no **private favor**,\n**without private favor**, they have no **private resentment**.\nCommon people are not so;\nbecause they possess **self-interest**,\nthey have **favor and resentment**.\n\nYet, if the world harbors **resentment**,\nthe **Sage** **responds with virtue** to **resentment**;\nif people are **not virtuous**,\nthe **Sage** **nurtures virtue** in the **virtuous**.\nThus, the people live in harmony,\nand there is no **resentment** between ruler and ruled.\n\n**Responding to resentment with virtue**—\nis this what the *Records* call **the compassion that widens the self**?\nDid **Zhongni** (仲尼) say that one who fulfills the **Dao** throughout the world has no **resentment or guilt**?\nDid he ever speak of the **Sage** having **resentment** toward things?\n\nThe **Classic** states:\n**Plan difficulties** while they are easy,\n**achieve greatness** while they are small.\nThe world’s difficult matters must be begun when they are easy,\nthe world’s great matters must be begun when they are small.\nThus, the **Sage** never strives for the great,\nand so can accomplish the great.\n\nThe **Sage** who makes **light promises** will be **few in trustworthiness**,\nwho takes **many easy paths** will meet **many difficulties**—\nthus the **Sage** treats even the easy with caution,\nand so ultimately faces no difficulty.\n\nThe **Commentary** states:\nThe **pivot of action** (枢机) is the world’s most easy thing,\nyet when it moves the heavens and earth,\nit becomes the world’s most difficult thing.\nThe **most sincere clarity** is the world’s most minute thing,\nyet when it leads to **enduring longevity**,\nit becomes the world’s greatest thing.\n\nThus, to move the heavens and earth,\none must take **speech with utmost care** as primary;\nto achieve **enduring longevity**,\none must **cultivate flexibility** as foundation.\nHolding fast to the primary and grasping the foundation,\nthen the **principles of the world** are attained.\n\nAll begin with what is **easy and small**,\nyet complete in what is **difficult and great**—\nthus the **Sage** never strives for the great,\nand so can accomplish the great.\n\nThose who make **light promises** are **few in trustworthiness**,\nwho take **many easy paths** meet **many difficulties**—\nthus, it is better to have **self-resentment** than to fail in **promises**,\nbetter to have **actions float above words** than to have **words float above actions**.\nEven the **Sage** finds this difficult,\nhow much more so for the common people?\n\nOnly because one begins with what is **not easy**,\ndoes one end with what is **not difficult**—\nthus, if one does not make **light promises** at the start,\none will not be **few in trustworthiness** at the end.\nThis is an inevitable principle—\ncan one not strive to uphold it?\n\nThe **Classic** states:\nWhen its **stability** is easy to maintain,\nwhen its **ominous signs** are easy to **plot against**,\nwhen its **fragility** is easy to **shatter**,\nwhen its **subtlety** is easy to **dissipate**—\n**act before it exists**, **govern before it is disordered**.\nA tree thick enough to embrace grows from a tiny sprout;\na nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;\na journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath one’s feet.\n\nThe **Commentary** states:\nIf the world is yet **stable**, it is easy to maintain its **fullness**;\nif a **state** is already **dangerous**, it is difficult to **settle its decline**.\nIf **deceitful intent** has not yet **manifested**, it is easy to **devise plots** and **eliminate it**;\nif **evil appearance** has already **taken shape**, it is difficult to **erase its extinction**.\nIf **sprouts** are still **tender**, their

**worries** are easy to **dispel**;\nif **wickedness and retribution** have already **become evident**, their **sin** is difficult to **pursue**.\nThus, the **Sage** **acts before it exists**,\nso that its **evil** does not **sprout**;\n**governs before it is disordered**,\nso that **harm** does not **arise**.\n\nTherefore, the **Sage’s governance** is **without knowing** and **without

clogs destroys the ear, bringing disaster.’*\nThis is the meaning of: *‘If the people do not fear great threats, then greater threats will come.’*\n\nThe petty man’s reason for not fearing threats and

      "translated_text": "Thus the Sage holds the left tablet of the contract,\nyet does not demand repayment from others.\nTherefore, one of virtue oversees the contract,\nwhile one without virtue oversees the receipt.\nThe Dao of Heaven shows no favoritism,\nyet always aligns with the virtuous.\n\n*The Commentary* says:\n‘When ruler and people are in harmony,\nthe people harbor no grudges.\nWhen ruler and people are estranged,\ngreat grudges arise.\nThough one may reconcile them,\nthe harm remains unhealed.\nWith lingering grudges,\nhow can this be considered good?\nMust it not be that there be no grudges at all?’\n\nIn ancient times, when knots were tied to make covenants,\nthe people did not deceive.\nWhen wooden tablets were split to record agreements,\nthe people did not violate them.\nWhy?\nBecause the Sage had no fixed intentions,\ntaking the hearts of the people as their own.\nThus, the Sage’s heart and the people’s heart\nwere like the left and right tablets of a contract.\nWhen the contract was presented, it was fulfilled without demand,\nso ruler and people were in harmony,\nand grudges never arose.\n\nLater generations could not hold the left tablet to respond to affairs,\nbut instead upheld the fixed receipt to govern the people.\nSeeking harmony in this way\ninevitably left lingering grudges.\n\nThus, it is known:\nA ruler of virtue oversees the heart-contract to avoid grudges—\nthis alone attains goodness.\nA ruler without virtue oversees only the written record to reconcile grudges—\nhow can this be considered good?\n\nThe Dao of Heaven shows no partiality,\nbestowing itself only upon the virtuous,\njust as the Sage holds the left tablet,\ntaking only the hearts of others as their own.\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"In small states with few people,\nlet the people have ten-fold or hundred-fold tools,\nyet they shall not use them.\nLet the people hold death in reverence\nand not wander far.\nThough there be boats and carriages,\nthey shall have no need to ride them.\nThough there be armor and weapons,\nthey shall have no need to display them.\nLet the people return to using knotted cords for contracts.\nLet their food be savored,\ntheir garments fine,\ntheir dwellings secure,\ntheir customs joyous.\nNeighboring states, though near enough to hear roosters crow and dogs bark,\nlet the people reach old age and die\nwithout visiting one another.\"*\n\n*The Commentary* says:\n‘Small states with few people,\nby nature unable to sustain themselves,\nyet if one of the Way governs them,\nthey can still prevent the people from using their ten-fold or hundred-fold tools\nfor warfare.\nThus, the people cherish life and revere death,\nare content with their land and do not migrate.\nThey do not seek distant allies for aid,\nso though there be boats and carriages,\nthey have no need to ride them.\nThey do not engage in aggression for gain,\nso though there be armor and weapons,\nthey have no need to display them.\nRuler and people live in harmony,\nthe living and the dead are without deceit.\nThe people return to using knotted cord covenants,\nand do not violate them.\nTheir desires are few,\nso they savor their coarse food,\nadmire their frugal garments.\nTheir taxes are light,\nso they are content in their dwellings,\nand their customs flourish.\nThough neighboring states are close enough to hear roosters crow and dogs bark,\nyet without desires or demands,\neach attains what they need,\nand thus they reach old age and die\nwithout visiting one another.\nThis is the pinnacle of governance.\nLaozi’s exposition of the teaching of Dao and virtue—\nhis intent lies here.’\n\n**Scripture** says:\n*\"Faithful words are not ornate,\nornate words are not faithful.\nThe virtuous do not argue,\nthose who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise are not learned,\nthe learned are not wise.\nThe Sage accumulates nothing.\nThe more one gives to others, the more one possesses.\nThe more one bestows upon others, the more one has.\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming,\nthe Dao of the Sage acts without contending.\"*\n\n*The Commentary* says:\n‘Faithful and true words need not be ornate,\nfor they are plain in substance.\nOrnate and beautiful words need not be faithful,\nfor they are superficial in form.\nThe virtuous in heart need not argue,\nfor they are rooted in simplicity.\nThose skilled in speech need not be virtuous,\nfor they value eloquence.\nThe wise in essence need not be learned,\nfor less is more in understanding.\nThe learned in affairs need not be wise,\nfor excess leads to confusion.\nThe Sage bestows virtue without private gain,\nso they accumulate nothing.\nExhausting virtue for others,\none’s own virtue grows ever greater;\nexhausting benefit for others,\none’s own benefit grows ever more abundant.\nThe Dao of Heaven—\nin spring and summer it nurtures and stores,\nin autumn and winter it matures and ripens—\nthis is to benefit without harming.\nThe Dao of the Sage—\nit follows the natural order of things,\nyet does not contend with them,\nfor it models itself after Heaven.’",
