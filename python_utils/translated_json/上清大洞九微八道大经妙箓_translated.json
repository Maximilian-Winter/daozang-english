Originally the latter half of *The Orthodox Scripture of the Three Heavens’ True Dharma*, later separated into an independent text. One fascicle.\n\n**Source of Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Section Zheng Yi.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Nine Subtleties Eight Dao Sublime Register**\n\nThe *Supreme Clarity Scripture for Eliminating the Six Heavens* and the *Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens* were compiled by command of the Sage Lord of Eastern Mound, the Celestial King of Lesser You of Clear Void. These divine registers of the immortals, collectively titled *The Scripture of the Six Heavens and the Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens’ Perfected Ones*, serve to capture myriad ghosts and restrain all demonic forces.\n\nTransmitted thrice over seven hundred years, and again by a perfected one every hundred years. All recipients must observe a three-day or seven-day retreat. During the retreat, they must offer their master—who possesses the scriptural texts—ten taels of fine gold as a token to commune with the spirits.\n\nThose in the world who violate these precepts shall incur seven generations of retribution, as decreed by the *Statutes of the Four Poles*. The register must not be exposed to yin qi or defilement; if so, the bearer shall surely descend as a lower ghost.\n\nThose who uphold this for Supreme Clarity shall ascend to Supreme Clarity. The Eight August Ones regard it as the unassailable bond of the perfected immortals. Those who possess this bond shall receive jade tablets inscribed by the Great Ultimate.\n\n**Registers of the Most High’s Myriad Scriptures**\nThe talisman above is written in vermilion, the text below in azure, with borders in vermilion.\n\nThis is the Purple Text of the Three Primordial Celestial Ladies, proclaiming to the essences of the Six Heavens’ myriad spirits, commanding them to guide the cloud dragons of the ten directions to attend and escort the diligent cultivator, lest they tread upon yin defilement.\n\nWithout bearing this *Supreme Clarity Scripture for Eliminating the Six Heavens*, when the era of Great Peace arrives, one shall not be received by the Sage Lord in the Palace of Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe *Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens* was transmitted by the Perfected King of Utmost Seclusion.\nThe talisman above is written in vermilion.\n\nAll who bear the true registers of the myriad scriptures shall be attended by ten jade lads by command of the Most High, guarding the bearer of the register. Later, the Sage Lord Li commanded the Celestial King of Lesser You to compile the true texts of the myriad heavens into the *Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens*. Those who bear it shall all be received by the Sage Lord in the Palace of Supreme Clarity.\n\n**The Upper Chapter of the Three Heavens’ Nine Subtleties Mysterious Capital Dark-Yang Numinous Register**\nReceived by the Heavenly Thearch Zhang from the Supreme Perfected Lord of Great Void.\n\n**The Three Directions’ Text of the Supple Perfected One of the Numinous Capital of Grand Tenuity**\nBestowed by the Nine Heavens’ Perfected King upon the Heavenly Thearch Zhang. Those who bear it shall pay homage to the myriad spirits, prolonging life by billions of years, guarded by three hundred talismanic attendants, six thousand jade maidens, and eight attendants of the Six Heavens, all residing in the Perfected Palace of the Numinous Capital of Grand Tenuity.\n\nDisciples who bear this text must vow to cultivate and uphold it with devotion.\n\nThe two talismans above feature vermilion borders and yellow script.\n\n**The three talismans above are all inscribed in vermilion by day. The eight talismans above are all bordered in vermilion with yellow script.**\n\nThe **Nine Subtleties Eight Dao Talismanic Register** is transmitted to immortals and Daoists of resolute aspiration. Once every hundred years, it emerges thrice, sworn before the August Sovereign Lord. Sacrifices are offered to the Nine Thearchs and the Mystic Yellow Maiden of Hua. It must not be recklessly disclosed; those without utmost devotion shall not be shown it. Guard this well, guard this well.\n\nWith reverence, I present this token of sincerity to the **Master of the Three Caverns**, humbly requesting to receive the **Jade Purity Great Cavern Nine Subtleties Eight Dao Supreme Wondrous Treasure Text and Upper Register**. I shall conceal my resolve and cultivate in seclusion, abiding by the master’s covenant of alliance. If there be Daoists of true aspiration or those whose names are inscribed in the immortal roster, transmit it thrice in a hundred years to perpetuate this great legacy.\n\nFrom this day forth into the degenerate age, human hearts grow shallow and dissolute. Yet when such a person appears, I dare not withhold this treasure. Now there is so-and-so, whose nature is refined and elegant, who cherishes and admires these sacred texts, rising early and retiring late with unwavering diligence. Dwelling in seclusion upon a famed peak, freed from worldly entanglements, they present their pledge and token of sincerity, seeking from me the transmission. In accordance with the Dharma, I shall perform the covenant of alliance and bestow it.\n\nShould they violate this trust, may the Seven Mysteries’ parents impose punishment in the Dark Palace, compelling them to carry stones and bear sand to dam the river’s source. Be ever vigilant, be ever vigilant—all as decreed by the covenant’s statutes and ordinances.\n\n**Endorsement and Supervision**\n\nThe Transmission Master has completed the bestowal of the *Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Ninefold Subtle Eightfold Dao Grand Scripture and Wondrous Register*.",
