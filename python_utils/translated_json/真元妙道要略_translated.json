  "full_translation": "**Essentials of the Wondrous Dao of True Primordiality**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *Essentials of the Wondrous Dao of True Primordiality*\n*Originally attributed to Zheng Siyuan. The text cites sayings of Li Ji, Wu Jun, and Yin Luozi, suggesting composition during the Five Dynasties or early Song period. One fascicle.*\n*Source of Base Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era, Dongshen Section, Category of Miscellaneous Arts.*\n\n**Essentials of the Wondrous Dao of True Primordiality**\n*By the Perfected Zheng Siyuan*\n\n**Chapter One: The Mirror for Dismissing the False and Verifying the True**\n\nThe Dao is the Yellow Way and the Crimson Qi, the refinement of the Seven and Nine returning to essence, with the Three-in-One Maiden as its subtlety. It lies in the absorption of qi and the restoration of the Elixir, whereby one attains sagehood, conceals oneself in the Eight Simplicities, and the immortals’ secrets reside in lead and mercury.\n\nThus, the oral instructions state: *\"Recognize the true lead and mercury, and the myriad transformations are exhausted. Penetrate the Eight Simplicities, and the true Dao is established.\"* These are the supreme essentials—if even one is lacking, there can be no accomplishment.\n\nI have privately observed that those who study the Dao without encountering an enlightened master mistake filth for the truth, erroneously refine lead and mercury, wasting their lives and ruining their families. The instances are too numerous to enumerate, so I briefly record them here, explaining the Eight Simplicities, the Maiden, lead, and mercury, listing them as follows:\n\nSome use common cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver, extracting mercury from distillation platforms, calling it *\"Heaven-Born Sprout,\"* yet those who ingest it die.\n\nSome roast mercury with sulfur to make *\"Spiritual Sand,\"* and those who consume it suffer head ruptures and back fissures.\n\nSome use litharge and lead yellow (lead oxide), calling it *\"Yellow Sprout.\"*\n\nSome roast black lead into *\"Water Lead,\"* using lead where it should not be used, resulting in consumptive illness.\n\nSome burn mulberry wood, leach it forty-eight times, and extract frost-like residue, calling it *\"Autumn Stone.\"*\n\nSome burn *jinshuo* grass or dung ash to obtain frost, calling it *\"Lead and Mercury.\"*\n\nSome use afterbirth, calling it *\"River Chariot\"* or *\"Purple Fragrance.\"*\n\nSome refine saltpeter nine times in a gourd, using crystal jade rings to gather moon water and sun fire, calling it *\"Great Medicine.\"*\n\nSome burn tin coins to extract lead pearls, calling them *\"True Lead within the Elixir.\"*\n\nSome use silver eggs to nurture cinnabar and mercury, subduing fire with alum. Zhang Guolao said: *\"Dragon-Tiger Elixir\"* refers to mercury subdued by fire into a uniform substance.\n\nSome roast cinnabar with salt, feed it to sixteen-year-old boys and girls, collect their urine, burn and leach it to extract frost, calling it *\"Lead and Mercury.\"*\n\nSome combine the Four Yellows and Eight Stones, burning them into *\"Great Medicine.\"*\n\nSome use eight kinds of mineral drugs to make *\"Great Medicine.\"*\n\nSome gather *duya* soap beans in the eleventh month, burn and refine them to extract frost, calling it *\"Heaven-Born Sprout.\"*\n\nSome use gourd-grown saltpeter and white quartz, calling it *\"Purple Quartz\"*—a single substance containing the Dao of Five Colors.\n\nSome boil frost, snow, and dew from a hundred plants, calling it *\"Divine Water\"* or *\"Flower Pool\"* for refinement.\n\nSome burn and refine ginger stone, mica, sulfur, and earth, calling them *\"Supreme Medicines.\"*\n\nSome mistake iron rust and verdigris for natural medicines, falsely citing the *Instructions of the Yin Perfected Lord*: *\"Golden Flowers arise as treasures of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nSome use mulberry galls and flea feces with ochre stones, calling them *\"Great and Small Sage Stones\"* or *\"Natural Cinnabar.\"*\n\nSome burn pine soot, calling it *\"True Black Lead of the One Child.\"*\n\nSome burn silk threads, extract ash, and boil it into *\"Great Medicine.\"*\n\nSome refine saltpeter with water from the Two Rivers and green basin water aged three years, intending it as *\"Supreme Medicine.\"*\n\nSome use a water-and-fire cauldron to burn red and white camphor roots, calling it *\"Mysterious Female.\"*\n\nSome combine azurite and malachite with mercury, subdue it with fire, and call it *\"True Gold.\"*\n\nSome mix sulfur, realgar, saltpeter, and honey, then burn them, causing flames to scorch hands and faces or burn down houses.\n\nSome use a water-and-fire furnace with nine partitions to burn mercury and green sand, calling it *\"Nine Cycles, Seven Returns Spiritual Sand.\"*\n\nSome burn red lead, lead white, and unrefined saltpeter into *\"Supreme Medicine.\"*\n\nSome combine and burn realgar and orpiment, calling it *\"The Dao of Knowing the Male and Guarding the Female.\"*\n\nSome refine a catty of black lead to extract a *zhu* of silver, calling it *\"Knowing the White and Guarding the Black,\"* claiming that *\"spiritual illumination comes naturally\"*—this is called *\"True Lead and Silver.\"*\n\nSome place a basin in the earth during the eleventh month to gather yin qi, mistaking it for *\"True Water.\"*\n\nSome burn fire-dung ash, leach it with winter water, boil it into frost, and call it *\"Great Medicine.\"*\n\nSome add an ounce of mercury to a catty of black lead, calling it *\"True One Divine Talisman\"* or *\"White Snow.\"*\n\nAll the aforementioned practices are pursued by those deluded and mistaken in their quest for the Dao. After years of refinement, they only waste wealth, ruin families, harm their bodies, and lose their lives, corrupting customs and undermining teachings. Such people are as numerous as hairs, yet none achieve even a fraction of success.\n\nAs the *Can Tong Qi* states:\n*\"Like the blind walking without a staff,\nThe deaf listening to palace music,\nDiving into water to catch pheasants and hares,\nClimbing mountains to seek fish and dragons.\"*\n\nIt also says:\n*\"Making two women live together,\nHaving Zhang Yi and Su Qin act as matchmakers,\nBidding them to marry—\nTheir hair will rot and teeth decay,\nYet they will never unite.\"*\n\nAnd further:\n*\"Mending a zither with glue,\nCoating a pot with gunpowder,\nRemoving cold by adding ice,\nCuring heat with boiling water,\nMaking turtles fly and snakes dance—\nAll are impossible.\"*\n\nWhy is this so? Because dissimilar things cannot be united.\n\nMaster Wei said: *\"Even if the Yellow Emperor tended the crucible,\nThe Great One wielded the fire,\nThe Eight Lords refined the elixir,\nAnd the Prince of Huainan blended the ingredients,\nErecting a towering altar with jade steps,\nOffering unicorn flesh and phoenix gall,\nHolding the registers and kneeling in reverence,\nPraying to the spirits and beseeching the gods,\nBathing and fasting in purification,\nAwaiting some result—\nIt would still be unattainable.\"*\n\nThe world does not understand that the Maiden is the cord of the *Dui* trigram, the Three-in-One is the ancestor of lead and mercury, the Yellow Way is the beginning of the ten numbers, and the Crimson Qi is the essence of the Seven Primes.\n\nAs the *Mysterious Subtleties Instructions* of Bi Tongzi states: *\"Long whistling and guiding the qi are the mechanisms of esoteric qi circulation. Visualizing the myriad spirits is the initial strategy for cutting off external distractions.\"*\n\nQi takes form through resonance, while essence reverts to the origin to become qi. Lead and mercury are the mother of Heaven and Earth, and the Maiden is another name for Golden Flower. Love of life is the root of all virtues, while delight in death is the source of all evils.\n\nIn brief, the subtlest and most essential Dao: enlightenment comes as swiftly as turning one’s palm, while delusion sets one apart as Heaven from Earth. Without a master to transmit the teachings, and clinging only to written texts, not one in ten thousand will succeed. Thus Master Chunyu states:\n\n*\"The world abounds with scholars,\nMen of lofty talent and fine skill.\nYet if they chance not to meet a true teacher,\nThey waste their wealth on false fires.\nRelying on texts and forcing their own interpretations,\nThey grasp at threads with no beginning,\nMeasure without fixed standards—\nAll in vain.\"*\n\nTruly, one must receive transmission from a master to attain the authentic Way, then never err.\n\nMaster Zhang’s *Five Chapters* also says: *\"If one obtains the true lead and mercury and cultivates without full completion, one may still attain longevity. No vast wealth is required—only the thorough practice of the method.\"*\n\nMaster Wei declares: *\"The sages of old had no innate foreknowledge; they awakened only through their teachers.\"*\n\nThe *Nanhua Treatise*, *Establishing the Universal Calendar*, *Mysterious Principles Discourse*, and *Oral Instructions of the Three Surnames* all state: *\"Fu Xi received the Diagram, the Yellow Emperor the Talisman, Gao Xin the Heavenly Classic, and Great Yu the Luo River Writ—yet how do these benefit men of later times?\"*\n\nThe oral instructions of the ancient sages say: *\"Five, three, and one are the purest essences of Heaven and Earth. They may be transmitted by word of mouth but are difficult to convey in writing.\"* Not daring to reveal the celestial mechanism in full, I record this briefly, awaiting the noble seeker of the Dao to study and practice it with care, to turn from evil and embrace virtue, lest one waste time waiting for the light to dawn.\n\nThe realms of immortals and mortals differ, as do the paths of men and ghosts. No immortal has ever learned from mortals, nor can a worthy person study from ghosts. Though the Way of immortals is profoundly distant, the superior person must cultivate it with utmost sincerity. Yet the paths of men and ghosts diverge entirely: the mediocre and lesser may practice and still align with it, for the sagely Dao cannot be perfected without long cultivation, while the ghostly state may be swiftly attained. Why is this so? Because things of like kind resonate, and sounds of the same nature respond to one another.\n\nThe ancients said: *\"A thousand days of good deeds are not enough, while a single evil act harms the body at once.\"*\n\nAncient texts state: *\"Virtuous blessings are like the five grains—they do not grow without being planted. Evil karma is like the hundred weeds—they flourish without being sown.\"*\n\nThis is because evil belongs to the poisonous yin nature, akin to the qi of autumn and winter. Autumn harms, winter kills, and all things wither, sinking back to their roots. Like water flowing downward when stirred, or man descending to the Yellow Springs in death.\n\nVital blessings belong to the numinous yang, like the growth of spring and the flourishing of summer. All things thrive, emerging from earth and returning to yang, bright as fire, blazing upward with ever-growing flame. Man is born to dwell in the yang realm, thus immortals ascend to the Nine Heavens above, like fire rising. If one cultivates the higher practices, not through accumulated merit or mere breath, the flame will burn ever brighter. Water does not require force to flow downward, just as death comes easily.\n\nThus Laozi said: *\"Habit forms nature.\"* And again: *\"A tree of arm-spanning girth begins as a tiny shoot. A nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth. A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.\"* The principle is clear.\n\nThus, though the gate may seem small, it is the first step to be taught, for through gradual practice one may ascend to the true. The essential method of the First Gate lies in preserving essence and nurturing life above all.\n\nThe way to preserve essence is this: first, banish wayward thoughts; second, take medicines to secure essence; third, reduce toil; fourth, sleep with knees drawn up; fifth, sleep little; sixth, avoid exhausting the will; seventh, guard against sorrow; eighth, harmonize joy and anger; ninth, avoid drunkenness and overindulgence; tenth, abstain from the five pungent foods; eleventh, cultivate equanimity—also called the Mean. These are the first steps of diligent progress. What follows brings further benefit.\n\nThe benefits, as stated in the *Dongyuan* and *Yuanjing Jing*, are these: to benefit oneself and others, linking cause and effect, where the superior practitioner achieves this power and gains profound benefits. The middling practitioner attains mastery over spirit and form, while the inferior practitioner separates body and nature. The superior practitioner ascends to the supreme fruit, the middling attains the rank of middle-grade immortal, and the inferior leaves behind the body to become a numinous ghost—these are the three grades of aspirants.\n\nFor the scholar who cultivates learning, it is essential never to disdain seeking guidance from those below, to broadly study the essential secrets, to refine and immerse oneself in the true, and thus to perceive the principle. When encountering a master who points out the subtleties, then all matters may be accomplished.\n\nAs for benefits, one should not seek blessings but rather aim for carefree ease, avoiding the pursuit of evil deeds. Instead, one should prepare and combine good medicines, distribute and bestow them, speak of goodness, transform others without limit, craft treasures for the world, and aid the poor and weak. These deeds should be performed in secret, while transgressions will inevitably be exposed—this is the mechanism of the great sage’s causal ground. Those who study should practice these actions.\n\nAs for medicines that benefit the world, they must not be made by those who have not mastered true mercury. Those who fabricate false medicines will surely incur misfortune—this must be approached with utmost caution. Transforming copper, iron, or tin into silver lacks essential subtlety and should not be attempted.\n\nHowever, malachite, chalcanthite, and cinnabar can produce the finest gold, far surpassing the transmutation of other substances. To refine malachite with cinnabar: first grind the malachite to an extremely fine powder, then wash it with water to remove all impurities before amalgamating it with mercury, avoiding cold water. One *liang* of good malachite can amalgamate with four *liang* of mercury. After refining and allowing it to settle overnight, it hardens like solid stone, its color resembling gold—this is the sign of well-refined malachite. If not yet transmuted, grind one *liang* into powder and combine it with alchemical fire. Add three *zhū* of realgar and one *fēn* of calomel, then grind and apply it to white stone powder along with two *jīn* of black lead, yielding two and a half *jīn* of red \"jade.\" If three *zhū* of refined arsenic are used instead, it becomes \"medicinal jade,\" the white jade of the marketplace, excluding cinnabar powder.\n\nIf the refinement is successful, the malachite and other cinnabar will be subdued, each transforming into superior gold. When extracted, if its color is red like yellow earth, it will melt into the finest gold. If it is greenish-black, it becomes red silver. If the color is unclear, it will not succeed—such failures, when melted, become mere copper. When the gold, silver, and other cinnabar are properly refined, each will transform into the true substance according to its matrix.\n\nIron-silver and tin-silver, when successfully refined, are called \"sacred mercury,\" capable of transmuting the five metals and hard stones into true treasures. Why is this so? One *jīn* of raw minerals is not as valuable as one *liǎng* of refined minerals. One *jīn* of refined minerals is not as valuable as one *liǎng* of refined saltpeter. One *jīn* of refined saltpeter is not as valuable as one *liǎng* of the Four Yellows. One *jīn* of the Four Yellows is not as valuable as one *liǎng* of purple radiant fragrant cinnabar. One *jīn* of purple radiant fragrant cinnabar is not as valuable as one *liǎng* of Dragon-Tiger sacred cinnabar. One *jīn* of Dragon-Tiger sacred cinnabar is not as valuable as one *zhū* of the Great Nine-Turned Elixir.\n\nAs for the so-called \"true sevenfold numinous cinnabar,\" I do not know its divine power, for I have not obtained its method—only what I have heard from my master. The oral instructions of the Most High Lord Lao were transmitted solely to Yin Xi and Zhang Daoling; these two alone received this method.\n\nYet I have observed that many ordinary people take common mercury, amalgamate it with sulfur to form green cinnabar, then heat it seven times in a water-and-fire crucible, consuming it as the \"Seven-Return Numinous Cinnabar.\" This is greatly mistaken—truly lamentable! I earnestly advise students to carefully examine the true secrets and not treat life lightly. Be cautious, be cautious!\n\nWhen refining the Four Yellows and the eight minerals, if they are contaminated with frost or have not been long-smelted into liquid, they are of no use. This is because the sovereign and ministers are in discord; though temporarily subdued, they will revert. After five smeltings, they gradually wither and darken—such withered substances are unusable. Testing with alchemical fire will confirm this without error.\n\nFor all medicines refined with fire, one must know the proper proportions of sovereign and ministers, ensuring the liquid is rich and viscous. Place a bean-sized amount on red charcoal and burn it; if it melts into oil that flows into the fire without smoke or flame, regardless of color, it can transform worldly benefits, and when consumed, it can also cure illnesses. However, one should not take too much, for excess will cause harm.\n\nRefined sulfur has the power to prepare medicines but lacks the ability to transmute alone. Realgar, orpiment, and refined arsenic all have their uses. Cinnabar, when refined with the proper sovereign and ministers, can also be used in various ways. If it naturally forms red silver, each *liǎng* can transmute three *zhū* of refined orpiment into superior gold. Refined arsenic can also be used to embrittle white copper.\n\nThe five metals, when combined with refined mercury, calomel, or refined cinnabar, become soft and malleable. However, refined cinnabar, while capable of softening substances, can also corrode them. A small amount aids the Four Yellows, but excess damages the five metals. To test this, place a bean-sized amount of refined cinnabar on a copper sheet and burn it three times—the copper will blacken, confirming its effect.\n\nArsenic, orpiment, mercury, and calomel often feign death when subduing the Three Yellows, but with proper refinement, they remain permanently subdued, all possessing the power to instantly transform the five metals. Only refined saltpeter cannot independently transmute the five metals or sulfur; it is suitable for medicinal use and aiding other medicines, but in excess, it spoils them.\n\nRaw saltpeter must not be burned with the Three Yellows, for disaster will immediately follow. When saltpeter is properly refined, testing it on red charcoal—if it melts into oil and enters the fire without reacting, it is subdued. If it melts into liquid in a crucible, it is not yet refined. Thus, one can discern its state of preparation.\n\nAs for green saltpeter that clings to the matrix, if it does not subdue when tested on charcoal, it will immediately burst into flame upon contact with the coals.\n\nWhen refining white alum with fire, if its taste remains as when raw, and it is heated in a crucible until thoroughly red and molten, becoming clear and resembling the color of burned silver or a bluish-white hue, and when struck produces the sound of metal or jade, it is then fit for consumption. Cinnabar and mercury are among the most difficult substances to subdue; they must be refined alone in the matrix. If combined with other medicines for refinement, they lose their potency and spoil the other ingredients.\n\nMoreover, among medicines, there are those stubbornly resistant to fire, those that melt under fire, those that desiccate under fire, and counterfeit medicines—each must be tested. Some sulfur resembles large borax, dyed with orpiment to feign refinement when molten; such sulfur harms those who consume it. Some is counterfeited with pyrite to mimic stubborn cinnabar resistant to fire. Some appears as sulfur mixed with stone, burned to imitate stubborn sulfur resistant to fire. All such are useless. This is briefly described for the scholar’s discernment.\n\nShould one encounter the wondrous cinnabar of Void and Purple Radiance, all the Four Yellows and Eight Stones may be subdued. The twenty-four transmutative essences, Golden Revival Paste, Golden Florescence Elixirs, and other alchemical medicines—even true lead and mercury—will then succeed. Since ancient times, sages have kept the mysteries of lead and mercury secret, transmitting them only orally, never committing them to writing.\n\nInitial-grade sacred cinnabar, when applied to iron, instantly whitens it like silver, though it cannot yet fully serve as a treasure. This tests the authenticity of cinnabar. The medicines of worldly utility have been fully described above; no erroneous accounts remain. A slight trial will reveal their nature.\n\nAll the medicines and sacred cinnabar I have described are found in the *Divine Farmer’s Materia Medica of Jade and Stone*, though Li Jie’s annotations contain many errors and distortions. Thus, I set forth these principles to elucidate the transformations of medicines, enlightening fellow seekers of the Dao. I hope for broader study, lest time be wasted in error and lives squandered. Examine carefully, verify thoroughly.\n\n**Verification of the Authentic, Second Scroll**\n\nEven the sun and moon wax and wane; how can mortals avoid cycles of fortune and misfortune? When the Dao and virtue remain unrefined and yin and yang are confused, the true Dao cannot be attained—only the five phases may be cultivated.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Worthy, Mother of the Great Dao, expounded the reversal of yin and yang to restore the primordial essence of the five phases, bestowing it upon the Most High Lord of the Dao. This was to deliver, across vast kalpas, those beings who study the Dao, enabling them to gather the primordial qi of the sun, moon, heaven, earth, and five phases, refine the Golden Elixir, complete one cyclical revolution, and consume it. Thus, they may become invulnerable to the five phases, move freely between existence and non-existence, ride cranes and dragons, roam the Purple Court, remain pure through ten thousand kalpas, and endure beyond the dust of eons—all by virtue of the divine power of primordial essence.\n\nFools, unaware of the supreme truth, claim that those who attain the Dao must flee beyond the Three Realms to escape the Three Calamities at the great kalpa’s end. How foolish! They do not know that the truly perfected body is of the same kind as primordial essence. As the Azure Lad said: *\"When the Dao is accomplished, the body endures through countless kalpas without suffering or toil, eternally pure and serene.\"* If one flees calamities by leaving one realm only to enter another, evading harm yet never escaping the cycle of labor, how can this be the true Dao? Moreover, if the five phases cannot assail one, how can the Three Calamities cause harm? Why do people not reflect on this?\n\nThe Three-in-One primordial essence is the root of heaven and earth, the origin of the Returned Elixir, the mother of the myriad things, the essence of the Seven Treasures, the body of the Great Dao, the parents of the sun and moon, the primal head of the five phases—first named the True One. Thus, the *Classic of Virtue* states: *\"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; the myriad things attain the One and come to life.\"* The Three Powers unite as One, hence called the Three-in-One.\n\nThe Three are Wood, Earth, and Water. Divided into three positions: in heaven, they are the Three Luminaries; on earth, the Three Treasures; in humans, the Three Clarities. Thus, the *Yellow Court Classic* says: *\"The Three Clarities emerge from brilliance to deliver life and death.\"* It also refers to them as \"nodes.\" Wood is the Dragon, in the positions of *chou*, *yin*, and *mao*. The One is the Water Tiger, in *zi*, *hai*, *xu*, and *you*. These two symbols transform and correspond to the seven attributes—*zi*, *chou*, *yin*, *mao*, *you*, *xu*, *hai*—converging at the position of the Chen star. In heaven, they are the Seven Stars; on earth, the Seven Treasures; in humans, the Seven Orifices. They complete the Three and Five, forming the Eight Essentials. Uniting the Six Harmonies, manifesting the Three and Five—these positions are explained in the third scroll.\n\nAs the scriptures state: *\"The Three and Five order all kinds, harmonize the myriad things, govern and transform yin and yang, cover and bear heaven and earth, illuminate the Four Seas, and regulate wind, rain, thunder, lightning, the four seasons, cold, heat, warmth, and frost, the qi of clarity and turbidity. Without the Three and Five, nothing stands.\"* The Three and Five are the pivot and belt of heaven and earth, the essential convergence of the Six A, the seasonal nodes of the Nine Palaces. Thus, the *Sacred Records* say: *\"The Dao of heaven is not distant; the Three and Five return.\"* This return is the Returned Elixir. When primordial qi coalesces and completes one cycle, the embryo is shed.\n\nBy mastering the revolutions of the Eight Trigrams and their mutual generation, after one year, the Returned Elixir is complete. The field has two eights, the elixir weighs one pound—its body is whole. Consuming it, one may attain immortality.\n\nHumans are originally formed from primordial qi; by replenishing it with the numinous essence of the primordial, one may attain longevity. The body unites with pure yang, forever transcending the yin realm—this is the Returned Elixir. The Elixir embodies the meaning of the yang number nine times nine, the color red. Red belongs to fire; when consumed, it ascends to the Nine Heavens, becoming a yang spirit, like fire that must rise. For those gentlemen who aspire to life and attain this, all affairs are complete—they have grasped the essentials of the Dao.\n\nYet though the ancient sages left behind extensive scriptures and methods, they concealed their essentials, causing later students to misidentify lead and mercury and fail in their cultivation.\n\nWhy say this? For lead and mercury alone lack the full complement of the Five Phases, and the Four Images remain incomplete—such are but sluggish, stagnant substances, ultimately unable to sustain life. Those who seek to trace the origins of the Elixir Way need only reflect: from whence do the self and all things arise? In this, they shall awaken to the sagely principle. Thus, the Old Master declared: \"That which has a name is the mother of the myriad things.\" This is it.\n\nIf one gathers this medicine of the Void, cultivating it as the field that nurtures the essence of sun and moon, the Golden Elixir may then be accomplished. Without encountering this essential Way, one may never attain the living Dao and will inevitably resort to corpse-liberation, leaving the form behind without ever stabilizing its substance. Such are the subtleties of the mysterious—without a luminous teacher, there is no means to comprehend them.\n\nYet I have observed that among students, there are often those who eavesdrop and, in their confusion, mislead one another. Therefore, I set forth this formula so that fellow Daoists may discern the great outline and avoid doubt. Though I do not here recite the common names of Dragon and Tiger, I reveal the workings of yin and yang. These workings are the ancestral source of the Golden Elixir, the intermingling essence of Dragon and Tiger, where Metal and Wood contend, Water and Fire punish, and the five spirits manifest their forms.\n\nAn ancient song says:\nThe sage seizes the intent of Creation,\nHand-gathering sun and moon to place within the crucible.\nSubtly inverting the essence of Heaven and Earth,\nBoring through yin and yang, driving gods and ghosts.\nWho recognizes the sun’s soul and the moon’s radiance?\n\nThe secret scripture states: \"The will must return to unity; the essential meaning admits no duality.\" This is it. Those who recognize this are true immortals—refine and consume it for a thousand days. A thousand days signifies the Great Nine Cycles of the Returned Elixir; once the body is free of yin, how could death occur? This is the song that recounts the beginning and end of the Returned Elixir.\n\nWhen first identifying cinnabar, though one follows the teacher’s instructions and recognizes Dragon and Tiger, there may still be doubt as to their authenticity. One should retreat to a place of profound stillness to convene Dragon and Tiger, where they meet and intermingle their essence. The Dragon roars, the Tiger howls; clouds and mist swirl, bolts seal the gates, and malevolent spirits flee in terror. Fragrant winds arise, Dragon and Tiger withdraw and conceal themselves, leaving their essence at the place of union—a substance like blood, bitter in taste, fragrant in qi, melting like ice upon entering the mouth. This is called the Returned Elixir; the immortals of the highest rank call it \"Galloping Cinnabar.\" Its fragrance fills ten households, and it can instantly transmute iron—though this is no mere alchemy. Such is the divine transformation of cinnabar.\n\nYet when this cinnabar is taken as the Elixir Field, the essence of sun and moon, and nurtured by the revolutions of days, months, and years, it congeals into the Elixir. Once formed, the Elixir departs the womb-field, leaving its mother—the mother being the Elixir Field, also called the crucible. The jade immortals consume its \"empty child,\" not its mother, using it to transmute worldly treasures and relieve the poor and weak. When those of the Dao consume it, they may attain long life. Even if one merely abstains from lust and consumes it, longevity is still achieved. For the hermit who fails to obtain this Elixir Field, the essence of sun and moon and the qi of the Five Phases will never congeal. Without the wondrous intermingling of Dragon and Tiger’s essence, it remains but common minerals or stones, never aligning with the numinous resonance of the sagely.\n\nNot only can this alone perform wondrous transformations—consider how lodestone attracts iron across a distance, or how crystal and clamshells dare the profound and remote. Water and fire respond to their kind; how could the distinction between mortal and sage be difficult? Even on the winter solstice, when wine and vinegar are brewed and lard is preserved, they remain unspoiled for years—how much more so when the primordial essence is refined through four thousand three hundred and twenty seasonal qi phases to become the Golden Elixir?\n\nThe Supreme Way flows abundantly, yet encountering it is not easy. When refining the Great Elixir, one must first secure the Returned Elixir to gradually ascend to transcendence. Before consuming this Elixir, one must thoroughly understand its signs. Without such understanding, doubt may arise, and the true work may be lost.\n\nWhen first consuming the Elixir, one may feel dullness and oppression in the heart and mind, with inauspicious dreams—these are the Three Worms, assailed by the numinous cinnabar, causing confusion. Such disturbances last but ten days. One may dream of vomiting rat droppings, tangled hair, thatch, or mud; or of great sores on the hands and body, from which spiders and lizards emerge. One may dream of the genitals rotting away or of defecating foul matter—do not doubt, for these are signs of the Three Corpses departing.\n\nAfter a hundred days, one may frequently feel warmth along the waist and back, as if scorched by the sun, or sense pearls within the palms, their light casting shadows within the body like the tender skin of an infant. Though initially fragile to the touch, the skin gradually hardens. The flesh may turn red as the cinnabar courses through the blood, dispelling long-standing ailments. Small sores may appear, neither painful nor itchy, gradually oozing pus and blood before falling away like dried bran, leaving the skin luminous. The eyes grow brighter, and in darkness, a yellow floral light, nearly three feet long and as thick as a tendon, may appear before them. Any scars or blemishes on the body gradually smooth over and vanish. One may produce much nasal mucus or clear water, frequent sneezing, or tears—do not be alarmed, for these are signs of pathogenic qi departing.\n\nThe limbs grow light and vigorous, and warmth may often be felt in the legs and knees, as if scorched by the sun. The stool may contain yellow pus or black blood for a day or two before ceasing—this expels long-standing ailments from the five viscera. Anger and vexation diminish, and one’s strength endures without fatigue. There are many other signs, too numerous to list in full. The above are the transmitted oral instructions of the teacher; all other signs follow similarly.\n\nI record this formula lest fellow Daoists, upon consuming this Elixir, fail to recognize its subtle signs. Should any details be lacking, the signs of Dragon and Tiger Elixir have been thoroughly expounded in the formulas of the ancient sages and the teachings of the Hidden Elder of Maiji Mountain, which circulate widely in the world—thus, I do not repeat them here. The ancient sages tested the resolve of mortals through these signs, which is why so few have truly received the transmission. This formula is a true and mutually reinforcing teaching; guard it closely and never transmit it to the unworthy.\n\nMoreover, when consuming the Elixir, one must abstain from scaleless fish, sheep’s blood, dog, soft-shelled turtle, and the flesh of animals that have died of themselves—such as horses and cattle—as well as gibbon meat, ginger, garlic, coriander, bitter greens, and rapeseed. It is best to avoid all these entirely. Those who aspire to long life should eat little rice; if consumed, it brings sensations of cold and heat, and the body grows heavy. This adverse reaction to rice is not part of the transmitted oral instructions. During one sweltering summer, I tended the furnace fire for many days, refining various minor medicines. Even in winter, I remained unaffected by cold or heat—until, by chance, I ate a bowl of rice rinsed in boiled water. For seven days thereafter, I felt feverish. Subsequent trials confirmed the same result. Let those of steadfast purpose take heed.\n\n**Chapter Three: Refining the Form**\n\nThe essence of refining the form lies in the profound mystery of *guarding the One*. The One, when expressed outwardly, becomes the movement of essence; when drawn inward, it becomes the nature of the heart-mind. It is the belt of *Taihe* and the *True One*, the root of all life. Sever the qi of procreation, and one returns to the origin.\n\nAccording to the *Transmitted Records of Intent*:\nFirst, preserve essence and circulate qi;\nSecond, gather the famed Mother of All Beings;\nThird, refine the form to transform its substance—\nthe five viscera become precious sinews,\nthe flesh and bones turn to gold and jade,\nhair regrows black, eyes regain their brightness,\nthe skin becomes smooth as jade, the body radiant.\nOne who masters this may appear or vanish at will,\nsee without limit, hear without end.\nThis is called the *Divine Perfected*;\nthe body unites with the Dao,\nbeyond the reach of creation’s changes,\nunknown even to spirits and gods.\nThe golden bones align with the *Lingyuan*,\nthe jade-like flesh flows with the *Six Wisdoms*.\n\nIt is also said: The *Six Wisdoms* are the true six consciousnesses.\nIn the mortal body, they are the six thieves and six viscera;\nin the sage’s body, they are the six wisdoms and six penetrations,\nthe six *jia* and six *ding* spirits.\nIn heaven and earth, they are the six directions, six pitch-pipes, and six harmonies.\nThus, one who attains the *Six Wisdoms* reaches the rank of immortals who ascend to perfection.\nWith the *Primordial Measure* added, the merit is beyond reckoning—\nthe fruit of the Great Dao.\n\nThis is achieved through an unshakable resolve,\ngrasping the essence of the *Cinnabar Flower*,\nand attaining effortless mastery,\nsurpassing even the path of the *Highest Perfected*.\n\nThe path of the *Highest Perfected* has three grades of true principle.\n\nThe **upper grade** refines the golden bones and jade-like flesh,\nuniting the embodied self with the primordial.\nThe great body has no exterior,\nthe small body has no interior.\nWhen manifest, it is a body of non-being;\nwhen concealed, it is a substance of emptiness.\nThis substance merges with the Great Void,\nits measure boundless—\nthis is the upper grade.\nAt the moment of leaving the mortal realm,\none ascends in broad daylight.\n\nThe **middle grade**, though both form and nature are perfected,\nhas a limited span of spirit.\nYet it moves without gate or barrier,\nmarking the initial attainment of the Dao’s fruit.\nFor those who awaken late in life,\nthey achieve *corpse liberation*,\nusing talismans or medicines to replace the body,\nleaving behind a lifeless husk,\nsevering worldly ties,\nand ascending to heaven at midnight.\nSome may choose seclusion as *earth immortals*,\nremaining pure through eons of dust,\nyet unable to dwell long in the upper realms,\nforever bound to the toils of coming and going.\nSeclusion here means concealing oneself under a different name.\nSuch immortals benefit only themselves,\nhence they are called the middle grade.\n\nThe *Cavern Perfection Scripture of Primordial Essence* states:\nThe **upper grade** cultivates for self and others,\nbody ascends, nature is complete,\nits merit boundless, aiding all within and without.\nThe **middle grade** benefits only the self,\nretreating into seclusion,\nits resolve weak, its virtue thin.\nThe **lower grade** leaks essence and qi,\nfailing to perfect body or nature,\nrequiring rebirth in another form.\nWith insufficient refinement,\na flawed resolve,\nand a withered will,\nthey drift through emptiness,\ntheir bodies already severed.\nStruggling to shed their stagnant forms,\nthey grieve like the moon in an empty night,\nyearning for the warmth of yang.\nOnly then may they bid farewell to birth and death.\n\nThus, those of the **lower grade**,\nunable to preserve both form and nature,\nor refine the body into qi to dissolve stagnation,\nmerging with emptiness,\nare called *ghosts of pure emptiness*—\nbodies of illusory existence,\nable only to briefly transform insubstantial things,\nlacking the power to transform the solid.\nOver time, their use fades,\nno different from mortals—\nmere wandering spirits without a master.\nFor while preserving life is exceedingly difficult,\nembracing death is all too easy,\nhence they are called the *lower immortals*.\n\nThe *Instructions of the Perfected of the Great Ultimate* state:\nThe inferior adept sheds their mortal frame,\nliberating like a cicada’s molt,\nslightly distinct from the common folk.\nIf one practices the *Numinous Kalpa of the Great Ultimate*,\nor the *Five Phases in the Pillow*,\nthe *Seven Transformations of the White Tiger*,\nor *Corpse Substitution and Seclusion*,\none may gradually approach the *Highest Perfected*.\nYet all below this are unworthy of the superior adept’s emulation.\n\nAs for the earlier mention of *emptying the heart* and *abiding in the heart*:\nTo *empty the heart* and concentrate is to lose the form and shed the mortal frame;\nto *abide in the heart* and concentrate is to refine the form.\nAbiding in the *Crimson Palace* leads to forgetting the Dao,\nyet the Dao naturally settles.\nEmptying the heart and forgetting emptiness,\nthe primordial merges with spontaneity—\nsuch is the method of the heart-mind.\n\nThe *Mother of Methods* says:\nMy method is without method,\nmy mystery without mystery—\nthis principle is profoundly subtle.\n\nThe *Scripture of Inner Observation* states:\nThe Dao of inner observation is to calm the spirit and settle the heart-mind,\nso that chaotic thoughts do not arise,\nand deviant delusions do not intrude.\nEncompassing body and all things,\none closes the eyes and seeks within.\n\nTo exhort students of the Dao:\nYou must pursue long life as the highest good,\nand never seek *corpse liberation*.\nFirst, it differs little from the mortal state;\nsecond, it harms the constant teachings;\nthird, it exhausts essence and invites poison;\nfourth, shallow-rooted beings indulge in vain imaginings;\nfifth, even if cultivation succeeds,\nwithout relying on another’s life,\none may be reborn as a heavenly being—\nyet still face the risk of regression.\nIf not reborn as a heavenly being,\none dies forever, never to live again—\nhow is this different from death?\nIt does not guarantee the preservation of one’s true nature.\n\nYou must firm your resolve.\nThough *corpse liberation* is recorded in the scriptures and instructions,\nit is merely a gradual path set forth by sages\nfor dull-witted learners,\nto ease their hearts.\nWhen the heart is at peace, the principle becomes clear.\n\nThus, Lord Lao said:\nDeath does not come again—\nwhy cling to the old?\nMaster Yang said:\nPity the foolish,\nwho value fame and wealth over their own lives,\ntreasure fleeting existence over the ultimate truth.\n\nMoreover, it is said:\nBurying will and qi beneath the mounds,\nshrouding cap and sword in dust and ash.\nAfter the eyes close and the form dissolves,\nall is desolate and hollow—\ndim and drifting,\nfollowing one’s station to be bound by things,\npursuing acquired images to take on new bodies,\nlike the dregs of the five grains,\nlike the graves of the mortal world.\nDescendants plant tokens and bow in offering,\npresenting sacrifices to the spirits.\nOnce the spirits have transformed,\nthe grave itself becomes the body—\nin brief, this is the way of it.\n\nThe Master of Misty Vines also said:\nThe body of the Dao, whole and true, lies in this life;\ndeluded followers wait for death to cultivate anew.\nIf this life does not resolve the matters of past lives,\nfrom what source will future lives arise?\n\nThe *Scripture of the Three Origins* further states:\nThe primordial qi of the Mystic Pearl—\nwho will guard it with the sun and moon?\nIts radiance flickers through images,\nthis is the longevity of divine immortals.\nWorldly men forcefully subdue their qi,\nyet those who subdue it exhaust their spirit.\nThe Great Dao abides in emptiness and non-being,\nits perfect light shines—this is the truth.\nThe true formula for long life,\nresplendent as the sea’s bright clarity.\nMoment by moment, guard the luminous,\nand the body will endure for ten thousand years.\nThe greatest difficulty lies in nothing but the Dao;\nthough the teaching is simple, who will uphold it?\nBeyond the light of images, the outer radiance—\nI and Heaven share the same longevity.\nAs the sun rises over the Eastern Sea,\nits light nourishes the ten thousand things.\nThe immortal enjoys eternal life,\ntransmitting this art of longevity.\n\nLaozi and Zhuangzi said:\n\"Long life and enduring vision—\nthe Valley Spirit does not die.\"\nAnd again:\n\"Those who attain long life and immortality—\nhow could there be any limit to their cultivation?\"\nAnd again:\n\"After a thousand years, weary of the world,\nthey depart as ascending immortals,\nriding the white clouds\nto the celestial realm.\"\nAnd again:\n\"Cultivating the body for twelve hundred years,\nits form never declines.\"\nAnd again:\n\"Riding white clouds,\ndriving flying dragons,\nroaming beyond the four seas.\"\nAnd again:\n\"All men die,\nyet I alone endure.\"\nAnd again:\n\"If the spirit guards the form,\nthe form attains long life.\"\nAnd again:\n\"Those who attain long life do not die;\nthose who enter quiescence are neither born nor die.\nNeither born nor dying—this is true long life,\ntrue quiescence.\nWithin the quiescence of life lies long life;\nbeyond the quiescence of death lies eternal death.\"\n\nThe *Scriptures of the Dao* state:\n\"The Dao gives birth and is called constancy;\nthe heart commands qi and is called strength.\"\n\nThe *Inner Chapters of the Mystic Wondrous* also say:\n\"If you desire long life,\nthe Three Ones must be made clear.\"\nHaving expounded this before—\nif a gentleman studying the Dao comprehends this principle,\nthe Three Essentials will naturally become clear.\nIf the true One can illuminate them,\nthe Three Essentials will naturally appear.\nMay those of steadfast aspiration\nverify and understand this.\nShould one not yet have encountered a teacher,\nlet love of life be the foundation,\nforgetting death the source.\nCarefully examine the secret essential scriptures within,\nand you will comprehend that the myriad vibrations share a single origin.\n\nI have traversed the awakening scriptures\nand the various elixirs,\nthus setting forth this formula,\nawaiting the earnest seeker.\n\n*The Wondrous Essentials of the True Origin* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**Essentials of the Wondrous Dao of True Primordiality**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *Essentials of the Wondrous Dao of True Primordiality*\n*Originally attributed to Zheng Siyuan. The text cites sayings of Li Ji, Wu Jun, and Yin Luozi, suggesting composition during the Five Dynasties or early Song period. One fascicle.*\n*Source of Base Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era, Dongshen Section, Category of Miscellaneous Arts.*\n\n**Essentials of the Wondrous Dao of True Primordiality**\n*By the Perfected Zheng Siyuan*\n\n**Chapter One: The Mirror for Dismissing the False and Verifying the True**\n\nThe Dao is the Yellow Way and the Crimson Qi, the refinement of the Seven and Nine returning to essence, with the Three-in-One Maiden as its subtlety. It lies in the absorption of qi and the restoration of the Elixir, whereby one attains sagehood, conceals oneself in the Eight Simplicities, and the immortals’ secrets reside in lead and mercury.\n\nThus, the oral instructions state: *\"Recognize the true lead and mercury, and the myriad transformations are exhausted. Penetrate the Eight Simplicities, and the true Dao is established.\"* These are the supreme essentials—if even one is lacking, there can be no accomplishment.\n\nI have privately observed that those who study the Dao without encountering an enlightened master mistake filth for the truth, erroneously refine lead and mercury, wasting their lives and ruining their families. The instances are too numerous to enumerate, so I briefly record them here, explaining the Eight Simplicities, the Maiden, lead, and mercury, listing them as follows:\n\nSome use common cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver, extracting mercury from distillation platforms, calling it *\"Heaven-Born Sprout,\"* yet those who ingest it die.\n\nSome roast mercury with sulfur to make *\"Spiritual Sand,\"* and those who consume it suffer head ruptures and back fissures.\n\nSome use litharge and lead yellow (lead oxide), calling it *\"Yellow Sprout.\"*\n\nSome roast black lead into *\"Water Lead,\"* using lead where it should not be used, resulting in consumptive illness.\n\nSome burn mulberry wood, leach it forty-eight times, and extract frost-like residue, calling it *\"Autumn Stone.\"*\n\nSome burn *jinshuo* grass or dung ash to obtain frost, calling it *\"Lead and Mercury.\"*\n\nSome use afterbirth, calling it *\"River Chariot\"* or *\"Purple Fragrance.\"*\n\nSome refine saltpeter nine times in a gourd, using crystal jade rings to gather moon water and sun fire, calling it *\"Great Medicine.\"*\n\nSome burn tin coins to extract lead pearls, calling them *\"True Lead within the Elixir.\"*\n\nSome use silver eggs to nurture cinnabar and mercury, subduing fire with alum. Zhang Guolao said: *\"Dragon-Tiger Elixir\"* refers to mercury subdued by fire into a uniform substance.\n\nSome roast cinnabar with salt, feed it to sixteen-year-old boys and girls, collect their urine, burn and leach it to extract frost, calling it *\"Lead and Mercury.\"*\n\nSome combine the Four Yellows and Eight Stones, burning them into *\"Great Medicine.\"*\n\nSome use eight kinds of mineral drugs to make *\"Great Medicine.\"*\n\nSome gather *duya* soap beans in the eleventh month, burn and refine them to extract frost, calling it *\"Heaven-Born Sprout.\"*\n\nSome use gourd-grown saltpeter and white quartz, calling it *\"Purple Quartz\"*—a single substance containing the Dao of Five Colors.\n\nSome boil frost, snow, and dew from a hundred plants, calling it *\"Divine Water\"* or *\"Flower Pool\"* for refinement.\n\nSome burn and refine ginger stone, mica, sulfur, and earth, calling them *\"Supreme Medicines.\"*\n\nSome mistake iron rust and verdigris for natural medicines, falsely citing the *Instructions of the Yin Perfected Lord*: *\"Golden Flowers arise as treasures of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nSome use mulberry galls and flea feces with ochre stones, calling them *\"Great and Small Sage Stones\"* or *\"Natural Cinnabar.\"*\n\nSome burn pine soot, calling it *\"True Black Lead of the One Child.\"*\n\nSome burn silk threads, extract ash, and boil it into *\"Great Medicine.\"*\n\nSome refine saltpeter with water from the Two Rivers and green basin water aged three years, intending it as *\"Supreme Medicine.\"*\n\nSome use a water-and-fire cauldron to burn red and white camphor roots, calling it *\"Mysterious Female.\"*\n\nSome combine azurite and malachite with mercury, subdue it with fire, and call it *\"True Gold.\"*\n\nSome mix sulfur, realgar, saltpeter, and honey, then burn them, causing flames to scorch hands and faces or burn down houses.\n\nSome use a water-and-fire furnace with nine partitions to burn mercury and green sand, calling it *\"Nine Cycles, Seven Returns Spiritual Sand.\"*\n\nSome burn red lead, lead white, and unrefined saltpeter into *\"Supreme Medicine.\"*\n\nSome combine and burn realgar and orpiment, calling it *\"The Dao of Knowing the Male and Guarding the Female.\"*\n\nSome refine a catty of black lead to extract a *zhu* of silver, calling it *\"Knowing the White and Guarding the Black,\"* claiming that *\"spiritual illumination comes naturally\"*—this is called *\"True Lead and Silver.\"*\n\nSome place a basin in the earth during the eleventh month to gather yin qi, mistaking it for *\"True Water.\"*\n\nSome burn fire-dung ash, leach it with winter water, boil it into frost, and call it *\"Great Medicine.\"*\n\nSome add an ounce of mercury to a catty of black lead, calling it *\"True One Divine Talisman\"* or *\"White Snow.\"*\n\nAll the aforementioned practices are pursued by those deluded and mistaken in their quest for the Dao. After years of refinement, they only waste wealth, ruin families, harm their bodies, and lose their lives, corrupting customs and undermining teachings. Such people are as numerous as hairs, yet none achieve even a fraction of success.\n\nAs the *Can Tong Qi* states:\n*\"Like the blind walking without a staff,\nThe deaf listening to palace music,\nDiving into water to catch pheasants and hares,\nClimbing mountains to seek fish and dragons.\"*\n\nIt also says:\n*\"Making two women live together,\nHaving Zhang Yi and Su Qin act as matchmakers,\nBidding them to marry—\nTheir hair will rot and teeth decay,\nYet they will never unite.\"*\n\nAnd further:\n*\"Mending a zither with glue,\nCoating a pot with gunpowder,\nRemoving cold by adding ice,\nCuring heat with boiling water,\nMaking turtles fly and snakes dance—\nAll are impossible.\"*\n\nWhy is this so? Because dissimilar things cannot be united.\n\nMaster Wei said: *\"Even if the Yellow Emperor tended the crucible,\nThe Great One wielded the fire,\nThe Eight Lords refined the elixir,\nAnd the Prince of Huainan blended the ingredients,\nErecting a towering altar with jade steps,\nOffering unicorn flesh and phoenix gall,\nHolding the registers and kneeling in reverence,\nPraying to the spirits and beseeching the gods,\nBathing and fasting in purification,\nAwaiting some result—\nIt would still be unattainable.\"*\n\nThe world does not understand that the Maiden is the cord of the *Dui* trigram, the Three-in-One is the ancestor of lead and mercury, the Yellow Way is the beginning of the ten numbers, and the Crimson Qi is the essence of the Seven Primes.\n\nAs the *Mysterious Subtleties Instructions* of Bi Tongzi states: *\"Long whistling and guiding the qi are the mechanisms of esoteric qi circulation. Visualizing the myriad spirits is the initial strategy for cutting off external distractions.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Qi takes form through resonance, while essence reverts to the origin to become qi. Lead and mercury are the mother of Heaven and Earth, and the Maiden is another name for Golden Flower. Love of life is the root of all virtues, while delight in death is the source of all evils.\n\nIn brief, the subtlest and most essential Dao: enlightenment comes as swiftly as turning one’s palm, while delusion sets one apart as Heaven from Earth. Without a master to transmit the teachings, and clinging only to written texts, not one in ten thousand will succeed. Thus Master Chunyu states:\n\n*\"The world abounds with scholars,\nMen of lofty talent and fine skill.\nYet if they chance not to meet a true teacher,\nThey waste their wealth on false fires.\nRelying on texts and forcing their own interpretations,\nThey grasp at threads with no beginning,\nMeasure without fixed standards—\nAll in vain.\"*\n\nTruly, one must receive transmission from a master to attain the authentic Way, then never err.\n\nMaster Zhang’s *Five Chapters* also says: *\"If one obtains the true lead and mercury and cultivates without full completion, one may still attain longevity. No vast wealth is required—only the thorough practice of the method.\"*\n\nMaster Wei declares: *\"The sages of old had no innate foreknowledge; they awakened only through their teachers.\"*\n\nThe *Nanhua Treatise*, *Establishing the Universal Calendar*, *Mysterious Principles Discourse*, and *Oral Instructions of the Three Surnames* all state: *\"Fu Xi received the Diagram, the Yellow Emperor the Talisman, Gao Xin the Heavenly Classic, and Great Yu the Luo River Writ—yet how do these benefit men of later times?\"*\n\nThe oral instructions of the ancient sages say: *\"Five, three, and one are the purest essences of Heaven and Earth. They may be transmitted by word of mouth but are difficult to convey in writing.\"* Not daring to reveal the celestial mechanism in full, I record this briefly, awaiting the noble seeker of the Dao to study and practice it with care, to turn from evil and embrace virtue, lest one waste time waiting for the light to dawn.\n\nThe realms of immortals and mortals differ, as do the paths of men and ghosts. No immortal has ever learned from mortals, nor can a worthy person study from ghosts. Though the Way of immortals is profoundly distant, the superior person must cultivate it with utmost sincerity. Yet the paths of men and ghosts diverge entirely: the mediocre and lesser may practice and still align with it, for the sagely Dao cannot be perfected without long cultivation, while the ghostly state may be swiftly attained. Why is this so? Because things of like kind resonate, and sounds of the same nature respond to one another.\n\nThe ancients said: *\"A thousand days of good deeds are not enough, while a single evil act harms the body at once.\"*\n\nAncient texts state: *\"Virtuous blessings are like the five grains—they do not grow without being planted. Evil karma is like the hundred weeds—they flourish without being sown.\"*\n\nThis is because evil belongs to the poisonous yin nature, akin to the qi of autumn and winter. Autumn harms, winter kills, and all things wither, sinking back to their roots. Like water flowing downward when stirred, or man descending to the Yellow Springs in death.\n\nVital blessings belong to the numinous yang, like the growth of spring and the flourishing of summer. All things thrive, emerging from earth and returning to yang, bright as fire, blazing upward with ever-growing flame. Man is born to dwell in the yang realm, thus immortals ascend to the Nine Heavens above, like fire rising. If one cultivates the higher practices, not through accumulated merit or mere breath, the flame will burn ever brighter. Water does not require force to flow downward, just as death comes easily.\n\nThus Laozi said: *\"Habit forms nature.\"* And again: *\"A tree of arm-spanning girth begins as a tiny shoot. A nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth. A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.\"* The principle is clear.\n\nThus, though the gate may seem small, it is the first step to be taught, for through gradual practice one may ascend to the true. The essential method of the First Gate lies in preserving essence and nurturing life above all.\n\nThe way to preserve essence is this: first, banish wayward thoughts; second, take medicines to secure essence; third, reduce toil; fourth, sleep with knees drawn up; fifth, sleep little; sixth, avoid exhausting the will; seventh, guard against sorrow; eighth, harmonize joy and anger; ninth, avoid drunkenness and overindulgence; tenth, abstain from the five pungent foods; eleventh, cultivate equanimity—also called the Mean. These are the first steps of diligent progress. What follows brings further benefit.",

      "translated_text": "The benefits, as stated in the *Dongyuan* and *Yuanjing Jing*, are these: to benefit oneself and others, linking cause and effect, where the superior practitioner achieves this power and gains profound benefits. The middling practitioner attains mastery over spirit and form, while the inferior practitioner separates body and nature. The superior practitioner ascends to the supreme fruit, the middling attains the rank of middle-grade immortal, and the inferior leaves behind the body to become a numinous ghost—these are the three grades of aspirants.\n\nFor the scholar who cultivates learning, it is essential never to disdain seeking guidance from those below, to broadly study the essential secrets, to refine and immerse oneself in the true, and thus to perceive the principle. When encountering a master who points out the subtleties, then all matters may be accomplished.\n\nAs for benefits, one should not seek blessings but rather aim for carefree ease, avoiding the pursuit of evil deeds. Instead, one should prepare and combine good medicines, distribute and bestow them, speak of goodness, transform others without limit, craft treasures for the world, and aid the poor and weak. These deeds should be performed in secret, while transgressions will inevitably be exposed—this is the mechanism of the great sage’s causal ground. Those who study should practice these actions.\n\nAs for medicines that benefit the world, they must not be made by those who have not mastered true mercury. Those who fabricate false medicines will surely incur misfortune—this must be approached with utmost caution. Transforming copper, iron, or tin into silver lacks essential subtlety and should not be attempted.\n\nHowever, malachite, chalcanthite, and cinnabar can produce the finest gold, far surpassing the transmutation of other substances. To refine malachite with cinnabar: first grind the malachite to an extremely fine powder, then wash it with water to remove all impurities before amalgamating it with mercury, avoiding cold water. One *liang* of good malachite can amalgamate with four *liang* of mercury. After refining and allowing it to settle overnight, it hardens like solid stone, its color resembling gold—this is the sign of well-refined malachite. If not yet transmuted, grind one *liang* into powder and combine it with alchemical fire. Add three *zhū* of realgar and one *fēn* of calomel, then grind and apply it to white stone powder along with two *jīn* of black lead, yielding two and a half *jīn* of red \"jade.\" If three *zhū* of refined arsenic are used instead, it becomes \"medicinal jade,\" the white jade of the marketplace, excluding cinnabar powder.\n\nIf the refinement is successful, the malachite and other cinnabar will be subdued, each transforming into superior gold. When extracted, if its color is red like yellow earth, it will melt into the finest gold. If it is greenish-black, it becomes red silver. If the color is unclear, it will not succeed—such failures, when melted, become mere copper. When the gold, silver, and other cinnabar are properly refined, each will transform into the true substance according to its matrix.\n\nIron-silver and tin-silver, when successfully refined, are called \"sacred mercury,\" capable of transmuting the five metals and hard stones into true treasures. Why is this so? One *jīn* of raw minerals is not as valuable as one *liǎng* of refined minerals. One *jīn* of refined minerals is not as valuable as one *liǎng* of refined saltpeter. One *jīn* of refined saltpeter is not as valuable as one *liǎng* of the Four Yellows. One *jīn* of the Four Yellows is not as valuable as one *liǎng* of purple radiant fragrant cinnabar. One *jīn* of purple radiant fragrant cinnabar is not as valuable as one *liǎng* of Dragon-Tiger sacred cinnabar. One *jīn* of Dragon-Tiger sacred cinnabar is not as valuable as one *zhū* of the Great Nine-Turned Elixir.\n\nAs for the so-called \"true sevenfold numinous cinnabar,\" I do not know its divine power, for I have not obtained its method—only what I have heard from my master. The oral instructions of the Most High Lord Lao were transmitted solely to Yin Xi and Zhang Daoling; these two alone received this method.\n\nYet I have observed that many ordinary people take common mercury, amalgamate it with sulfur to form green cinnabar, then heat it seven times in a water-and-fire crucible, consuming it as the \"Seven-Return Numinous Cinnabar.\" This is greatly mistaken—truly lamentable! I earnestly advise students to carefully examine the true secrets and not treat life lightly. Be cautious, be cautious!\n\nWhen refining the Four Yellows and the eight minerals, if they are contaminated with frost or have not been long-smelted into liquid, they are of no use. This is because the sovereign and ministers are in discord; though temporarily subdued, they will revert. After five smeltings, they gradually wither and darken—such withered substances are unusable. Testing with alchemical fire will confirm this without error.\n\nFor all medicines refined with fire, one must know the proper proportions of sovereign and ministers, ensuring the liquid is rich and viscous. Place a bean-sized amount on red charcoal and burn it; if it melts into oil that flows into the fire without smoke or flame, regardless of color, it can transform worldly benefits, and when consumed, it can also cure illnesses. However, one should not take too much, for excess will cause harm.\n\nRefined sulfur has the power to prepare medicines but lacks the ability to transmute alone. Realgar, orpiment, and refined arsenic all have their uses. Cinnabar, when refined with the proper sovereign and ministers, can also be used in various ways. If it naturally forms red silver, each *liǎng* can transmute three *zhū* of refined orpiment into superior gold. Refined arsenic can also be used to embrittle white copper.\n\nThe five metals, when combined with refined mercury, calomel, or refined cinnabar, become soft and malleable. However, refined cinnabar, while capable of softening substances, can also corrode them. A small amount aids the Four Yellows, but excess damages the five metals. To test this, place a bean-sized amount of refined cinnabar on a copper sheet and burn it three times—the copper will blacken, confirming its effect.\n\nArsenic, orpiment, mercury, and calomel often feign death when subduing the Three Yellows, but with proper refinement, they remain permanently subdued, all possessing the power to instantly transform the five metals. Only refined saltpeter cannot independently transmute the five metals or sulfur; it is suitable for medicinal use and aiding other medicines, but in excess, it spoils them.\n\nRaw saltpeter must not be burned with the Three Yellows, for disaster will immediately follow. When saltpeter is properly refined, testing it on red charcoal—if it melts into oil and enters the fire without reacting, it is subdued. If it melts into liquid in a crucible, it is not yet refined. Thus, one can discern its state of preparation.\n\nAs for green saltpeter that clings to the matrix, if it does not subdue when tested on charcoal, it will immediately burst into flame upon contact with the coals.",

      "translated_text": "When refining white alum with fire, if its taste remains as when raw, and it is heated in a crucible until thoroughly red and molten, becoming clear and resembling the color of burned silver or a bluish-white hue, and when struck produces the sound of metal or jade, it is then fit for consumption. Cinnabar and mercury are among the most difficult substances to subdue; they must be refined alone in the matrix. If combined with other medicines for refinement, they lose their potency and spoil the other ingredients.\n\nMoreover, among medicines, there are those stubbornly resistant to fire, those that melt under fire, those that desiccate under fire, and counterfeit medicines—each must be tested. Some sulfur resembles large borax, dyed with orpiment to feign refinement when molten; such sulfur harms those who consume it. Some is counterfeited with pyrite to mimic stubborn cinnabar resistant to fire. Some appears as sulfur mixed with stone, burned to imitate stubborn sulfur resistant to fire. All such are useless. This is briefly described for the scholar’s discernment.\n\nShould one encounter the wondrous cinnabar of Void and Purple Radiance, all the Four Yellows and Eight Stones may be subdued. The twenty-four transmutative essences, Golden Revival Paste, Golden Florescence Elixirs, and other alchemical medicines—even true lead and mercury—will then succeed. Since ancient times, sages have kept the mysteries of lead and mercury secret, transmitting them only orally, never committing them to writing.\n\nInitial-grade sacred cinnabar, when applied to iron, instantly whitens it like silver, though it cannot yet fully serve as a treasure. This tests the authenticity of cinnabar. The medicines of worldly utility have been fully described above; no erroneous accounts remain. A slight trial will reveal their nature.\n\nAll the medicines and sacred cinnabar I have described are found in the *Divine Farmer’s Materia Medica of Jade and Stone*, though Li Jie’s annotations contain many errors and distortions. Thus, I set forth these principles to elucidate the transformations of medicines, enlightening fellow seekers of the Dao. I hope for broader study, lest time be wasted in error and lives squandered. Examine carefully, verify thoroughly.\n\n**Verification of the Authentic, Second Scroll**\n\nEven the sun and moon wax and wane; how can mortals avoid cycles of fortune and misfortune? When the Dao and virtue remain unrefined and yin and yang are confused, the true Dao cannot be attained—only the five phases may be cultivated.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Worthy, Mother of the Great Dao, expounded the reversal of yin and yang to restore the primordial essence of the five phases, bestowing it upon the Most High Lord of the Dao. This was to deliver, across vast kalpas, those beings who study the Dao, enabling them to gather the primordial qi of the sun, moon, heaven, earth, and five phases, refine the Golden Elixir, complete one cyclical revolution, and consume it. Thus, they may become invulnerable to the five phases, move freely between existence and non-existence, ride cranes and dragons, roam the Purple Court, remain pure through ten thousand kalpas, and endure beyond the dust of eons—all by virtue of the divine power of primordial essence.\n\nFools, unaware of the supreme truth, claim that those who attain the Dao must flee beyond the Three Realms to escape the Three Calamities at the great kalpa’s end. How foolish! They do not know that the truly perfected body is of the same kind as primordial essence. As the Azure Lad said: *\"When the Dao is accomplished, the body endures through countless kalpas without suffering or toil, eternally pure and serene.\"* If one flees calamities by leaving one realm only to enter another, evading harm yet never escaping the cycle of labor, how can this be the true Dao? Moreover, if the five phases cannot assail one, how can the Three Calamities cause harm? Why do people not reflect on this?\n\nThe Three-in-One primordial essence is the root of heaven and earth, the origin of the Returned Elixir, the mother of the myriad things, the essence of the Seven Treasures, the body of the Great Dao, the parents of the sun and moon, the primal head of the five phases—first named the True One. Thus, the *Classic of Virtue* states: *\"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; the myriad things attain the One and come to life.\"* The Three Powers unite as One, hence called the Three-in-One.\n\nThe Three are Wood, Earth, and Water. Divided into three positions: in heaven, they are the Three Luminaries; on earth, the Three Treasures; in humans, the Three Clarities. Thus, the *Yellow Court Classic* says: *\"The Three Clarities emerge from brilliance to deliver life and death.\"* It also refers to them as \"nodes.\" Wood is the Dragon, in the positions of *chou*, *yin*, and *mao*. The One is the Water Tiger, in *zi*, *hai*, *xu*, and *you*. These two symbols transform and correspond to the seven attributes—*zi*, *chou*, *yin*, *mao*, *you*, *xu*, *hai*—converging at the position of the Chen star. In heaven, they are the Seven Stars; on earth, the Seven Treasures; in humans, the Seven Orifices. They complete the Three and Five, forming the Eight Essentials. Uniting the Six Harmonies, manifesting the Three and Five—these positions are explained in the third scroll.\n\nAs the scriptures state: *\"The Three and Five order all kinds, harmonize the myriad things, govern and transform yin and yang, cover and bear heaven and earth, illuminate the Four Seas, and regulate wind, rain, thunder, lightning, the four seasons, cold, heat, warmth, and frost, the qi of clarity and turbidity. Without the Three and Five, nothing stands.\"* The Three and Five are the pivot and belt of heaven and earth, the essential convergence of the Six A, the seasonal nodes of the Nine Palaces. Thus, the *Sacred Records* say: *\"The Dao of heaven is not distant; the Three and Five return.\"* This return is the Returned Elixir. When primordial qi coalesces and completes one cycle, the embryo is shed.\n\nBy mastering the revolutions of the Eight Trigrams and their mutual generation, after one year, the Returned Elixir is complete. The field has two eights, the elixir weighs one pound—its body is whole. Consuming it, one may attain immortality.\n\nHumans are originally formed from primordial qi; by replenishing it with the numinous essence of the primordial, one may attain longevity. The body unites with pure yang, forever transcending the yin realm—this is the Returned Elixir. The Elixir embodies the meaning of the yang number nine times nine, the color red. Red belongs to fire; when consumed, it ascends to the Nine Heavens, becoming a yang spirit, like fire that must rise. For those gentlemen who aspire to life and attain this, all affairs are complete—they have grasped the essentials of the Dao.\n\nYet though the ancient sages left behind extensive scriptures and methods, they concealed their essentials, causing later students to misidentify lead and mercury and fail in their cultivation.",

For lead and mercury alone lack the full complement of the Five Phases, and the Four Images remain incomplete—such are but sluggish, stagnant substances, ultimately unable to sustain life. Those who seek to trace the origins of the Elixir Way need only reflect: from whence do the self and all things arise? In this, they shall awaken to the sagely principle. Thus, the Old Master declared: \"That which has a name is the mother of the myriad things.\" This is it.\n\nIf one gathers this medicine of the Void, cultivating it as the field that nurtures the essence of sun and moon, the Golden Elixir may then be accomplished. Without encountering this essential Way, one may never attain the living Dao and will inevitably resort to corpse-liberation, leaving the form behind without ever stabilizing its substance. Such are the subtleties of the mysterious—without a luminous teacher, there is no means to comprehend them.\n\nYet I have observed that among students, there are often those who eavesdrop and, in their confusion, mislead one another. Therefore, I set forth this formula so that fellow Daoists may discern the great outline and avoid doubt. Though I do not here recite the common names of Dragon and Tiger, I reveal the workings of yin and yang. These workings are the ancestral source of the Golden Elixir, the intermingling essence of Dragon and Tiger, where Metal and Wood contend, Water and Fire punish, and the five spirits manifest their forms.\n\nAn ancient song says:\nThe sage seizes the intent of Creation,\nHand-gathering sun and moon to place within the crucible.\nSubtly inverting the essence of Heaven and Earth,\nBoring through yin and yang, driving gods and ghosts.\nWho recognizes the sun’s soul and the moon’s radiance?\n\nThe secret scripture states: \"The will must return to unity; the essential meaning admits no duality.\" This is it. Those who recognize this are true immortals—refine and consume it for a thousand days. A thousand days signifies the Great Nine Cycles of the Returned Elixir; once the body is free of yin, how could death occur? This is the song that recounts the beginning and end of the Returned Elixir.\n\nWhen first identifying cinnabar, though one follows the teacher’s instructions and recognizes Dragon and Tiger, there may still be doubt as to their authenticity. One should retreat to a place of profound stillness to convene Dragon and Tiger, where they meet and intermingle their essence. The Dragon roars, the Tiger howls; clouds and mist swirl, bolts seal the gates, and malevolent spirits flee in terror. Fragrant winds arise, Dragon and Tiger withdraw and conceal themselves, leaving their essence at the place of union—a substance like blood, bitter in taste, fragrant in qi, melting like ice upon entering the mouth. This is called the Returned Elixir; the immortals of the highest rank call it \"Galloping Cinnabar.\" Its fragrance fills ten households, and it can instantly transmute iron—though this is no mere alchemy. Such is the divine transformation of cinnabar.\n\nYet when this cinnabar is taken as the Elixir Field, the essence of sun and moon, and nurtured by the revolutions of days, months, and years, it congeals into the Elixir. Once formed, the Elixir departs the womb-field, leaving its mother—the mother being the Elixir Field, also called the crucible. The jade immortals consume its \"empty child,\" not its mother, using it to transmute worldly treasures and relieve the poor and weak. When those of the Dao consume it, they may attain long life. Even if one merely abstains from lust and consumes it, longevity is still achieved. For the hermit who fails to obtain this Elixir Field, the essence of sun and moon and the qi of the Five Phases will never congeal. Without the wondrous intermingling of Dragon and Tiger’s essence, it remains but common minerals or stones, never aligning with the numinous resonance of the sagely.\n\nNot only can this alone perform wondrous transformations—consider how lodestone attracts iron across a distance, or how crystal and clamshells dare the profound and remote. Water and fire respond to their kind; how could the distinction between mortal and sage be difficult? Even on the winter solstice, when wine and vinegar are brewed and lard is preserved, they remain unspoiled for years—how much more so when the primordial essence is refined through four thousand three hundred and twenty seasonal qi phases to become the Golden Elixir?\n\nThe Supreme Way flows abundantly, yet encountering it is not easy. When refining the Great Elixir, one must first secure the Returned Elixir to gradually ascend to transcendence. Before consuming this Elixir, one must thoroughly understand its signs. Without such understanding, doubt may arise, and the true work may be lost.\n\nWhen first consuming the Elixir, one may feel dullness and oppression in the heart and mind, with inauspicious dreams—these are the Three Worms, assailed by the numinous cinnabar, causing confusion. Such disturbances last but ten days. One may dream of vomiting rat droppings, tangled hair, thatch, or mud; or of great sores on the hands and body, from which spiders and lizards emerge. One may dream of the genitals rotting away or of defecating foul matter—do not doubt, for these are signs of the Three Corpses departing.\n\nAfter a hundred days, one may frequently feel warmth along the waist and back, as if scorched by the sun, or sense pearls within the palms, their light casting shadows within the body like the tender skin of an infant. Though initially fragile to the touch, the skin gradually hardens. The flesh may turn red as the cinnabar courses through the blood, dispelling long-standing ailments. Small sores may appear, neither painful nor itchy, gradually oozing pus and blood before falling away like dried bran, leaving the skin luminous. The eyes grow brighter, and in darkness, a yellow floral light, nearly three feet long and as thick as a tendon, may appear before them. Any scars or blemishes on the body gradually smooth over and vanish. One may produce much nasal mucus or clear water, frequent sneezing, or tears—do not be alarmed, for these are signs of pathogenic qi departing.\n\nThe limbs grow light and vigorous, and warmth may often be felt in the legs and knees, as if scorched by the sun. The stool may contain yellow pus or black blood for a day or two before ceasing—this expels long-standing ailments from the five viscera. Anger and vexation diminish, and one’s strength endures without fatigue. There are many other signs, too numerous to list in full. The above are the transmitted oral instructions of the teacher; all other signs follow similarly.\n\nI record this formula lest fellow Daoists, upon consuming this Elixir, fail to recognize its subtle signs. Should any details be lacking, the signs of Dragon and Tiger Elixir have been thoroughly expounded in the formulas of the ancient sages and the teachings of the Hidden Elder of Maiji Mountain, which circulate widely in the world—thus, I do not repeat them here. The ancient sages tested the resolve of mortals through these signs, which is why so few have truly received the transmission. This formula is a true and mutually reinforcing teaching; guard it closely and never transmit it to the unworthy.",

Red belongs to fire; when consumed, it ascends to the Nine Heavens, becoming a yang spirit, like fire that must rise. For those gentlemen who aspire to life and attain this, all affairs are complete—they have grasped the essentials of the Dao.\n\nYet though the ancient sages left behind extensive scriptures and methods, they concealed their essentials, causing later students to misidentify lead and mercury and fail in their cultivation.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, when consuming the Elixir, one must abstain from scaleless fish, sheep’s blood, dog, soft-shelled turtle, and the flesh of animals that have died of themselves—such as horses and cattle—as well as gibbon meat, ginger, garlic, coriander, bitter greens, and rapeseed. It is best to avoid all these entirely. Those who aspire to long life should eat little rice; if consumed, it brings sensations of cold and heat, and the body grows heavy. This adverse reaction to rice is not part of the transmitted oral instructions. During one sweltering summer, I tended the furnace fire for many days, refining various minor medicines. Even in winter, I remained unaffected by cold or heat—until, by chance, I ate a bowl of rice rinsed in boiled water. For seven days thereafter, I felt feverish. Subsequent trials confirmed the same result. Let those of steadfast purpose take heed.\n\n**Chapter Three: Refining the Form**\n\nThe essence of refining the form lies in the profound mystery of *guarding the One*. The One, when expressed outwardly, becomes the movement of essence; when drawn inward, it becomes the nature of the heart-mind. It is the belt of *Taihe* and the *True One*, the root of all life. Sever the qi of procreation, and one returns to the origin.\n\nAccording to the *Transmitted Records of Intent*:\nFirst, preserve essence and circulate qi;\nSecond, gather the famed Mother of All Beings;\nThird, refine the form to transform its substance—\nthe five viscera become precious sinews,\nthe flesh and bones turn to gold and jade,\nhair regrows black, eyes regain their brightness,\nthe skin becomes smooth as jade, the body radiant.\nOne who masters this may appear or vanish at will,\nsee without limit, hear without end.\nThis is called the *Divine Perfected*;\nthe body unites with the Dao,\nbeyond the reach of creation’s changes,\nunknown even to spirits and gods.\nThe golden bones align with the *Lingyuan*,\nthe jade-like flesh flows with the *Six Wisdoms*.\n\nIt is also said: The *Six Wisdoms* are the true six consciousnesses.\nIn the mortal body, they are the six thieves and six viscera;\nin the sage’s body, they are the six wisdoms and six penetrations,\nthe six *jia* and six *ding* spirits.\nIn heaven and earth, they are the six directions, six pitch-pipes, and six harmonies.\nThus, one who attains the *Six Wisdoms* reaches the rank of immortals who ascend to perfection.\nWith the *Primordial Measure* added, the merit is beyond reckoning—\nthe fruit of the Great Dao.\n\nThis is achieved through an unshakable resolve,\ngrasping the essence of the *Cinnabar Flower*,\nand attaining effortless mastery,\nsurpassing even the path of the *Highest Perfected*.\n\nThe path of the *Highest Perfected* has three grades of true principle.\n\nThe **upper grade** refines the golden bones and jade-like flesh,\nuniting the embodied self with the primordial.\nThe great body has no exterior,\nthe small body has no interior.\nWhen manifest, it is a body of non-being;\nwhen concealed, it is a substance of emptiness.\nThis substance merges with the Great Void,\nits measure boundless—\nthis is the upper grade.\nAt the moment of leaving the mortal realm,\none ascends in broad daylight.\n\nThe **middle grade**, though both form and nature are perfected,\nhas a limited span of spirit.\nYet it moves without gate or barrier,\nmarking the initial attainment of the Dao’s fruit.\nFor those who awaken late in life,\nthey achieve *corpse liberation*,\nusing talismans or medicines to replace the body,\nleaving behind a lifeless husk,\nsevering worldly ties,\nand ascending to heaven at midnight.\nSome may choose seclusion as *earth immortals*,\nremaining pure through eons of dust,\nyet unable to dwell long in the upper realms,\nforever bound to the toils of coming and going.\nSeclusion here means concealing oneself under a different name.\nSuch immortals benefit only themselves,\nhence they are called the middle grade.\n\nThe *Cavern Perfection Scripture of Primordial Essence* states:\nThe **upper grade** cultivates for self and others,\nbody ascends, nature is complete,\nits merit boundless, aiding all within and without.\nThe **middle grade** benefits only the self,\nretreating into seclusion,\nits resolve weak, its virtue thin.\nThe **lower grade** leaks essence and qi,\nfailing to perfect body or nature,\nrequiring rebirth in another form.\nWith insufficient refinement,\na flawed resolve,\nand a withered will,\nthey drift through emptiness,\ntheir bodies already severed.\nStruggling to shed their stagnant forms,\nthey grieve like the moon in an empty night,\nyearning for the warmth of yang.\nOnly then may they bid farewell to birth and death.\n\nThus, those of the **lower grade**,\nunable to preserve both form and nature,\nor refine the body into qi to dissolve stagnation,\nmerging with emptiness,\nare called *ghosts of pure emptiness*—\nbodies of illusory existence,\nable only to briefly transform insubstantial things,\nlacking the power to transform the solid.\nOver time, their use fades,\nno different from mortals—\nmere wandering spirits without a master.\nFor while preserving life is exceedingly difficult,\nembracing death is all too easy,\nhence they are called the *lower immortals*.\n\nThe *Instructions of the Perfected of the Great Ultimate* state:\nThe inferior adept sheds their mortal frame,\nliberating like a cicada’s molt,\nslightly distinct from the common folk.\nIf one practices the *Numinous Kalpa of the Great Ultimate*,\nor the *Five Phases in the Pillow*,\nthe *Seven Transformations of the White Tiger*,\nor *Corpse Substitution and Seclusion*,\none may gradually approach the *Highest Perfected*.\nYet all below this are unworthy of the superior adept’s emulation.\n\nAs for the earlier mention of *emptying the heart* and *abiding in the heart*:\nTo *empty the heart* and concentrate is to lose the form and shed the mortal frame;\nto *abide in the heart* and concentrate is to refine the form.\nAbiding in the *Crimson Palace* leads to forgetting the Dao,\nyet the Dao naturally settles.\nEmptying the heart and forgetting emptiness,\nthe primordial merges with spontaneity—\nsuch is the method of the heart-mind.\n\nThe *Mother of Methods* says:\nMy method is without method,\nmy mystery without mystery—\nthis principle is profoundly subtle.\n\nThe *Scripture of Inner Observation* states:\nThe Dao of inner observation is to calm the spirit and settle the heart-mind,\nso that chaotic thoughts do not arise,\nand deviant delusions do not intrude.\nEncompassing body and all things,\none closes the eyes and seeks within.\n\nTo exhort students of the Dao:\nYou must pursue long life as the highest good,\nand never seek *corpse liberation*.\nFirst, it differs little from the mortal state;\nsecond, it harms the constant teachings;\nthird, it exhausts essence and invites poison;\nfourth, shallow-rooted beings indulge in vain imaginings;\nfifth, even if cultivation succeeds,\nwithout relying on another’s life,\none may be reborn as a heavenly being—\nyet still face the risk of regression.\nIf not reborn as a heavenly being,\none dies forever, never to live again—\nhow is this different from death?\nIt does not guarantee the preservation of one’s true nature.\n\nYou must firm your resolve.\nThough *corpse liberation* is recorded in the scriptures and instructions,\nit is merely a gradual path set forth by sages\nfor dull-witted learners,\nto ease their hearts.\nWhen the heart is at peace, the principle becomes clear.\n\nThus, Lord Lao said:\nDeath does not come again—\nwhy cling to the old?\nMaster Yang said:\nPity the foolish,\nwho value fame and wealth over their own lives,\ntreasure fleeting existence over the ultimate truth.",
