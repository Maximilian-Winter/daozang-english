  "full_translation": "*The Supreme Jade Writ of the Luminous Silk Text for Determining Immortal Registers*\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Jade Writ of the Luminous Silk Text for Determining Immortal Registers*\n**Author:** Unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties, attributed to the Perfected Queen Mother of the Western Citadel (Wang Fu-ren of the Shangqing tradition).\n**Compilation:** Incorporates esoteric graphs and true names from the registers of the Three Caverns.\n**Volume:** One scroll.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Yujue* (Jade Instructions) category of the *Dongzhen* (Cavern of Perfection) section.\n\n---\n\n*The Supreme Jade Writ of the Luminous Silk Text for Determining Immortal Registers*\n**Transmitted by the Queen Mother of the Golden Citadel of the Western Realm**\n\nOn the first day of a certain month and year, marked by the cyclical signs *jiazi*, the adept [Name], styled [Honorific], having been blessed in a former life and now favored in this one, previously received from the Dharma Master [Name] of [Sacred Peak] the inner instructions of the *Luminous Silk Text*, the scriptures of the host of sages, and the Way of ascending as an immortal—thereby determining one’s immortal rank. The chapters were sealed with golden tokens, and the oath was sworn in blood before the White Phoenix, binding for an eon until a worthy successor might receive the transmission.\n\nNow, a fellow aspirant, having begun the study of the *jia-yi* (first stages of Daoist practice) and already received the great covenant of the supreme sacred statutes, governs the myriad spirits, summons demonic and numinous beings, commands dragons and summons perfected ones, seals and oversees the Five Peaks, and supervises the rivers and springs. Having engraved the original text of the oath, it ascends to the mysterious void; having cut blood for the pact, the talismanic ranks of the myriad perfected are established. The seven ancestral generations stand witness to the covenant—this teaching is not lightly transmitted.\n\nShould the secret graphs and texts of the *Luminous Silk* be divulged, the transgressor’s corpse shall be severed in the dark springs, their seven generations of parents shall suffer interrogation by the Three Officials, and they shall be judged according to the statutes of the Four Poles.\n\n**The secret name of the Heavenly Sovereign Lord is *He*.**\n**[Four graphs.]**\n\nThe Earthly Sovereign Lord’s secret name is *Zha*. **[Seven graphs.]**\n\nThe Human Sovereign Lord’s secret name is *Chang*. **[Five graphs.]**\n\nWith the eye aligned to the bright star within the Celestial Heart, the minor luminaries and lesser astral bodies, the Qian and Kun earthly deities, the Dipper’s reception, the forest’s tremor, the mao earthly gate, the xun cyclical branch, the wu noon, the human portal at yong, the dui western gate, the qian celestial gate, the si ghost gate, the gen cyclical branch, the head’s wu, the jia, yi, bing, ding, geng, xin, ren—none may ride the rigid stalwart or approach the human realm. Yang’s lament, benevolence’s longevity, prosperity’s nine heavens, nine heavens’ nine lands, nine humans’ destinies, nine perfected ones, nine Ways, nine transmissions, nine births, nine subtleties, nine mysteries, nine essentials, nine completions—with these, transcend the heavens. Zhang the Valiant, thirty prohibitions, the dragon’s mandate, the nine constructions of morning and night, the nine establishments of removal and fullness, the stabilization of the celestial chambers, the ascent of luminous deities—these are the vital flexions of fate’s phrases. Assist the radiant fire’s three humans, the nine heavens’ scorching flame, the nine celestial reckonings of the spirit’s great emergence. The azure soul’s distant decree commands the earth to bow thrice. Nine stones, nine jade maidens emerge from the young luminaries’ triad. The three qian prohibitions, nine pellets, nine celestial transformations, nine oxen, two humans, the fish of the sun—none may equal thirty days. The nine unities of left and right, the four stone mountains’ deities issue forth destiny’s prosperity. Between the maidens’ intervals, the Ding of Prosperity emerges, entering and exiting within the Five Emperors. The Five Emperors confer upon the Three Sovereigns’ primal heads—once enlightened, the August Right’s excellence enters the Grand Clarity’s fiery Horn, Neck, House, Heart, Tail, Winnowing Basket, Dipper, Ox, Maiden, Emptiness, Rooftop, Chamber, Straddler, Harvester, Stomach, Punishment, Net, Turtle Beak, Triad—destiny seeks immortality. The five unite with the eternal heights, the nine heavens’ Great One, the Northern Army, the Five Peaks, the Four Readings, the Three Rivers, the Six Lords, the Eastern Sea’s thirty-six thousand dark luminaries, the stars and constellations, the ancient ghosts and spirits, the hidden origins, the myriad convergences—those who revere shall preserve; those who lose shall perish. Should one emerge as a true person, they shall not be led astray. Prosperity attends the heavens, awaiting the imperial command. Should the path curve, the nine dukes and marquises’ true persons shall serve the river, augment the Dipper, govern the five hearts, and follow the celestial mandate from youth to age—the immortal artisans.\n\n**[The Heavenly Sovereign’s section comprises 314 graphs.]**\n\nThe eight directions’ cyclic completion does not decree life’s seclusion. The shen sea’s fiery king, the dragon’s jade wall, the great stone’s celestial shen enters the azure sea’s firm canopy. The six ding’s rivers must follow the stars’ flow, investigating antiquity. The Han’s ancestral lineage, the Yin’s five generations’ radiant illumination, the divine Tang’s essence—what celestial chart does the summoned pavilion of the mountain’s separation derive from? The Ming Emperor, having established Ye, harmonized with the divine. The young northern star, Li’s nine gen, the drum’s thunder lord—only when internally bound to the Dipper does it not divide the sun’s governance. Paired with the Ox, they form herds, coming like swallows, departing like rats and insects. The myriad dark destinies lie in wait, with the streaming stars and the twenty cyclical branches. Cherishing the root, the nine heavens’ mountains, stones, and waters—clarity severs sorrow. The assistant studies jade essence, the martial world’s urgent merit, privately embracing the one. The ten above and below, the three eights’ domains, the qian and gen’s nine, the two and four’s xun issue forth destiny. The Yi’s absence from the rivers, seas, and great pools’ depths—within the sorrowful, the divine’s qi communicates. With qian entering kun, the two extremes’ convergence—doubt ceases, the right assists the branches’ beginning. The universal urgency of ghosts, the urgency of sins, the premature doom of blessings—transcend the mountains’ woods, the mounds’ peril. The August Dragon pairs with yin’s extremes. The seven divisions of sun and moon, the Dipper’s entry into the celestial father—nine mysteries encircle the heavens, aiding the celestial maidens’ jade luster. The vermilion eyes’ fiery decree must extinguish the heavens’ center, the waters’ center, the sheep, each celestial arrow. The human and the sun and moon’s great brilliance.\n\n**[The Earthly Sovereign’s section comprises 233 graphs.]**\n\nIn the worldly dragon’s celestial tusk, the great heavens’ Zhang Mingye, the four nines’ mountains flow weakly, emerging from the left eight hundred’s midst. The Zi Celestial Gate collects ghosts, uniting with the nine heavens’ entry into the nine mountains’ urgency. Revering the Horn’s non-Peng, the jia and yi’s celestial grandson, the three heavens’ luminous white—ghosts are thus commanded by the August Heaven’s decree. The six ding comply as the statutes command. The hundred ghosts, not the stars, depart urgently. The three heavens’ mandate—above, it becomes the forest’s ghosts. The young’s sincerity decides the sun’s division into places of emergence and departure. Joy accompanies the azure tiger. The Three Sovereigns’ northern edict—also named the Twenty-Eight Constellations—advances the mandate. The Great One emerges from the vast heavens’ nine tracks, suddenly possessing the statutes’ enclosure. Movement and pacing comply with the almanac’s records. The three urgent commands of the luminous lord differ—thus, the nine rivers’ avoidance texts appear. The Thunder Duke differs—thus, the nine rivers blaze, governing the myriad emergences. The Dipper and Ox extend life without end. The celestial minister’s mutual assistance does not terminate the statutory text.\n\n**[The Human Sovereign’s section comprises 158 graphs.]**\n\nThe nine heavens command the Upper Heaven’s lesser Northern Army, the Eastern Sea’s Azure Lad, the Dark General, the Divine King Father, the responsive jade stars’ positions, the jade maidens, the mysterious deities, the Great Emperor, the Thunder Duke’s arrayed positions, the yang ding, the Three Sovereigns, the Five Lords, the Six Dukes. The exalted names reach the celestial chambers, entering all rivers and peaks.\n\n**[The Great Talisman comprises 50 graphs.]**\n\nThe High Nine Heavens command the August Emperor of the Upper Heaven, the lesser Northern Army, the Eastern Sea’s Lesser Lad, the Dark General’s horse, the Divine King Father, the responsive Queen Mother bearing positions, the jade maidens, the mysterious deities, the Clear Heaven’s Supreme Emperor, the Cloud Thunder Duke’s arrayed positions, the yin and yang’s six ding, the Three Sovereigns, the Five Lords. The urgent memorial commands compliance. The exalted summons the High Heaven’s Western Chamber Lady, entering all rivers and peaks’ forty-eight seated positions. The celestial and earthly various maidens’ talismans arrive as summoned. The Jade Maiden, Plain Maiden, Charming Maiden, Purple Radiance, Mysterious Essence, River Wondrous One, the Five Peaks’ Azure Forest, the Nine Heavens’ parents, the Wind Earl—send names urgently as commanded. The Celestial Chancellor, the Swift Censor, the Fire Lord, the Divine Lady—once the memorial arrives, hasten as the statutes command. The three urgent commands of the luminous lord—Bao Hu’s sudden departure, the Three Ladies, the Old Woman, Peng’s son—inquire urgently to assume positions without delay. The Celestial Day’s Patrol stabs the treacherous and investigates affairs in the Nine Heavens.\n\n**[The Internal Text comprises 162 graphs.]**\n\nThe Three Sovereigns together comprise 933 graphs.\n\nThe Eastern Peak Lord’s tabooed name is Qu Gengsheng.\nThe Southern Peak Lord’s tabooed name is Zhu Changzhong.\nThe Central Peak Lord’s tabooed name is Jade Essence.\nThe Western Peak Lord’s tabooed name is Ru Quzheng.\nThe Northern Peak Lord’s tabooed name is Xuan Yinfeng.\n\nThe Five Azure Pearls, the Nine Heavens’ parents—send names urgently as commanded. The Celestial Chancellor, the Swift Censor, the Most High Divine One—once the memorial arrives, hasten as the statutes command. The three luminous lords—Bao Hu’s sudden departure, the Three Heavenly Persons, the Old Master—inquire urgently to assume positions without delay. The Celestial Day’s Patrol investigates treacherous affairs and reports all who fail to answer the summons.\n\nThe Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Metal Emperors of the Nine Heavens—whose tabooed names reside in the worldly dragon—are commanded by the Nine Heavens to ascend to the heavens. The Lesser Northern Army, the Eastern Sea Youth, the Dark General, the Divine King Father, the Responding King, the Chancellor—take positions. The Jade Maiden, the Mysterious Spirit, the Great Emperor, the Numinous Thunder Duke—send names to their ranks. The yang-ding, the Three Sovereigns, the Five Lords—once the memorial arrives at the Highest, summon the High Heaven’s Western Chamber Lady to enter all the river and mountain forty-eight seats. The celestial and earthly various maidens’ talismans arrive as summoned. The Jade Maiden, Charming Maiden, Purple Radiance, Mysterious Essence, River Wondrous One, the Five Azure Pearls, the Nine Heavens’ parents—send names urgently as commanded. The Celestial Chancellor, the Most High Divine One—once the memorial arrives, hasten as the statutes command.\n\n**[The Five Peaks comprise 164 graphs. The Five Peaks together total one hundred graphs.]**\n\nThe Seventy-Eight Graphs.\nThe Numinous Treasure Lord’s surname and taboo name.\n\n**Eastern Direction (120 graphs):**\nThe Nine Qi’s Primordial Sovereign of the Azure Heaven, the Green Radiance, and the Towering Guardians—within them dwells an Elder who oversees the celestial registers and commands qi to summon immortals. The Year Star assists the liver; Horn, Neck, and the Four Quarters’ revolving scenes are governed by Winnowing Basket, master of the Seven Luminaries. The Dipper’s bright wheel receives qi, seizing the false and sweeping away calamities. The Eastern Mountain’s divine incantation summons the Nine Heavens’ Red Script talismans to bind Fengdu, restrain demons, and dispatch ghosts—none dare evade execution. All are sent to the Wood Palace. Should any delay, the Eastern River and the Vast Sea’s water spirits shall be constrained: great kalpas of floods, dragons bearing disasters, and the Water Palace’s paths—hundreds and thousands of passages—shall be opened by the Supreme Emperor’s Red Writ amid the primordial wind and fire.\n\n**Eastern Direction Talisman (16 graphs):**\nThe Nine Qi’s Azure Heaven illuminates the true Dao; the Jade Talisman commands qi, treasured by all perfected beings.\n\n**Southern Direction (148 graphs):**\nWithin the Vermilion Heaven’s Crimson Emperor and Jade Hall resides a great spirit named the Crimson Sovereign, whose blazing flames and threefold qi radiate brilliance. Immortals receive their mandate in accord with destiny; the Great Fire Star assists the heart. Well and Ghost guard Chamber; Willow, Star, Spread, and Wing resist the Four Quarters. The Seven Lodgings revolve, the celestial constant summoned to hasten convergence upon the true Dao. The Red Writ commands spirits; the north binds Fengdu, dispatching demonic lineages and severing evil roots. The talisman’s decree punishes clearly, enumerating crimes. The Southern Mountain’s divine incantation subdues the Eight Directions’ myriad demons, annihilating all trials. The Southern River’s Water Emperor, Great Earl, and Dragon Kings’ incantations circulate, universally sweeping away inauspicious floods and flying disasters. Dragons are summoned to open and clear waterways—thousands of paths, myriad passages. Should any dare transgress, they shall be sent to the Fire Palace by the Red Writ’s proclamation; none may disobey.\n\n**Southern Direction Talisman (8 graphs):**\nThe Primordial Supreme Emperor opens Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Central Direction (144 graphs):**\nThe Yellow High Heaven’s Central Numinous One, the Primordial, gives birth to the Five Elders. The August Highest commands qi, supervises the perfected, and oversees the immortals’ records and mysterious charts. Jade Writs hasten the ascent of qi, universally notifying the myriad spirits. The Quelling Star assists the spleen; the Northern Culmen revolves, mastering the false and severing evil roots. Dust is swept away, miasmas dispelled. The Mysterious Dipper’s bright degrees traverse the Celestial Pass. The Nine Heavens’ talismanic commands are transmitted by the Golden Horse Post, constraining the Northern Emperor to block the Ghost Gate and excise inauspiciousness. None may stand before it. The Central Mountain’s divine incantation summons dragons to ascend clouds, converging upon the Yellow River’s nine streams. The river’s source may not overflow; good and evil are distinguished. A thousand demons and myriad deceits face the Emperor Lord. Should any dare transgress, the Great Yang’s scorching flames shall burn the Red Writ’s jade graphs, proclaiming universally.\n\n**Central Direction Talisman (9 graphs):**\nMaster all immortals, command and summon the river’s source.\n\n**Western Direction (136 graphs):**\nThe White Emperor of the Pale Heaven’s Seven Gates, the Golden Numinous One, shines resplendently. The Great Hua’s flowing vapors and the towering White Stone’s sevenfold qi billow upward. There dwells the Primordial Elder, a great spirit who oversees lung qi, governs the Nine Heavens’ registers, and commands the ascent of immortals. The Great White Star inspects the lungs; Straddler and Harvester guard the soul; Stomach, Mane, and Net assist. The Seven Passes are mastered by the Three Stars; the Dipper’s handle receives talismans. The Northern Culmen’s Red Writ and jade graphs, the Nine Heavens’ true script, summon the myriad qi to return universally to the Emperor Lord. The Western Mountain’s divine incantation, the Eight Might’s Seven Transmissions, summons dragons from waters and clouds from mountains, all converging at the Emperor’s gate to assist and guard the perfected. Evil roots are severed. Should any inauspiciousness arise, it shall be cut off by the Golden Pass. The Red Writ’s talismanic commands are transmitted by wind and fire.\n\n**Western Direction Talisman (7 graphs):**\nAdvance the true, command the correct, and all spirits obey.\n\n**Northern Direction (120 graphs):**\nThe Dark Heaven’s Five Qi meander; within dwell the Black Emperor and the Twin Sovereigns of the Great Subtlety, who oversee talismanic commands. Immortals refine the Eight Might, clad in azure skirts and feathered capes, dragon-patterned and phoenix-robed. The Supreme Emperor’s decrees ascend the Jade Stairs. The Northern Culmen assists the kidneys; Dipper and Oxguard defend the gates; Girl, Void, Rooftop, and Encampment open the Four Quarters. The Seven Stars grasp the baleful, rectify the false, and sweep away calamities, illuminating the Dao with penetrating radiance. The Northern Mountain’s divine incantation stirs yang to summon thunder, flowing bells, and blazing meteors. The Heavenly Ape shakes the heavens with might. The Northern Fengdu’s legions—myriad demons—are annihilated. The Nine Rivers drain dry; the Crow Mother’s flock scatters. Dragons open waterways; paths are cleared. The Red Writ’s jade graphs are transmitted by galloping dragons and racing winds.\n\n**Northern Direction Talisman (8 graphs):**\nThe Mysterious Highest and Jade Clarity command the Northern Fengdu’s dragons.\n\n**The Five Directions’ Closing Writs:**\nThe sun and moon fix the mountains and waters; the Three Heavens’ great measures cause the myriad perfected to meander. *(Azure Emperor, 16 graphs)*\nJade tones exhale qi; the Three Primes govern, preserving life and determining immortality.

      "translated_text": "The Earthly Sovereign Lord’s secret name is *Zha*. **[Seven graphs.]**\n\nThe Human Sovereign Lord’s secret name is *Chang*. **[Five graphs.]**\n\nWith the eye aligned to the bright star within the Celestial Heart, the minor luminaries and lesser astral bodies, the Qian and Kun earthly deities, the Dipper’s reception, the forest’s tremor, the mao earthly gate, the xun cyclical branch, the wu noon, the human portal at yong, the dui western gate, the qian celestial gate, the si ghost gate, the gen cyclical branch, the head’s wu, the jia, yi, bing, ding, geng, xin, ren—none may ride the rigid stalwart or approach the human realm. Yang’s lament, benevolence’s longevity, prosperity’s nine heavens, nine heavens’ nine lands, nine humans’ destinies, nine perfected ones, nine Ways, nine transmissions, nine births, nine subtleties, nine mysteries, nine essentials, nine completions—with these, transcend the heavens. Zhang the Valiant, thirty prohibitions, the dragon’s mandate, the nine constructions of morning and night, the nine establishments of removal and fullness, the stabilization of the celestial chambers, the ascent of luminous deities—these are the vital flexions of fate’s phrases. Assist the radiant fire’s three humans, the nine heavens’ scorching flame, the nine celestial reckonings of the spirit’s great emergence. The azure soul’s distant decree commands the earth to bow thrice. Nine stones, nine jade maidens emerge from the young luminaries’ triad. The three qian prohibitions, nine pellets, nine celestial transformations, nine oxen, two humans, the fish of the sun—none may equal thirty days. The nine unities of left and right, the four stone mountains’ deities issue forth destiny’s prosperity. Between the maidens’ intervals, the Ding of Prosperity emerges, entering and exiting within the Five Emperors. The Five Emperors confer upon the Three Sovereigns’ primal heads—once enlightened, the August Right’s excellence enters the Grand Clarity’s fiery Horn, Neck, House, Heart, Tail, Winnowing Basket, Dipper, Ox, Maiden, Emptiness, Rooftop, Chamber, Straddler, Harvester, Stomach, Punishment, Net, Turtle Beak, Triad—destiny seeks immortality. The five unite with the eternal heights, the nine heavens’ Great One, the Northern Army, the Five Peaks, the Four Readings, the Three Rivers, the Six Lords, the Eastern Sea’s thirty-six thousand dark luminaries, the stars and constellations, the ancient ghosts and spirits, the hidden origins, the myriad convergences—those who revere shall preserve; those who lose shall perish. Should one emerge as a true person, they shall not be led astray. Prosperity attends the heavens, awaiting the imperial command. Should the path curve, the nine dukes and marquises’ true persons shall serve the river, augment the Dipper, govern the five hearts, and follow the celestial mandate from youth to age—the immortal artisans.\n\n**[The Heavenly Sovereign’s section comprises 314 graphs.]**\n\nThe eight directions’ cyclic completion does not decree life’s seclusion. The shen sea’s fiery king, the dragon’s jade wall, the great stone’s celestial shen enters the azure sea’s firm canopy. The six ding’s rivers must follow the stars’ flow, investigating antiquity. The Han’s ancestral lineage, the Yin’s five generations’ radiant illumination, the divine Tang’s essence—what celestial chart does the summoned pavilion of the mountain’s separation derive from? The Ming Emperor, having established Ye, harmonized with the divine. The young northern star, Li’s nine gen, the drum’s thunder lord—only when internally bound to the Dipper does it not divide the sun’s governance. Paired with the Ox, they form herds, coming like swallows, departing like rats and insects. The myriad dark destinies lie in wait, with the streaming stars and the twenty cyclical branches. Cherishing the root, the nine heavens’ mountains, stones, and waters—clarity severs sorrow. The assistant studies jade essence, the martial world’s urgent merit, privately embracing the one. The ten above and below, the three eights’ domains, the qian and gen’s nine, the two and four’s xun issue forth destiny. The Yi’s absence from the rivers, seas, and great pools’ depths—within the sorrowful, the divine’s qi communicates. With qian entering kun, the two extremes’ convergence—doubt ceases, the right assists the branches’ beginning. The universal urgency of ghosts, the urgency of sins, the premature doom of blessings—transcend the mountains’ woods, the mounds’ peril. The August Dragon pairs with yin’s extremes. The seven divisions of sun and moon, the Dipper’s entry into the celestial father—nine mysteries encircle the heavens, aiding the celestial maidens’ jade luster. The vermilion eyes’ fiery decree must extinguish the heavens’ center, the waters’ center, the sheep, each celestial arrow. The human and the sun and moon’s great brilliance.\n\n**[The Earthly Sovereign’s section comprises 233 graphs.]**\n\nIn the worldly dragon’s celestial tusk, the great heavens’ Zhang Mingye, the four nines’ mountains flow weakly, emerging from the left eight hundred’s midst. The Zi Celestial Gate collects ghosts, uniting with the nine heavens’ entry into the nine mountains’ urgency. Revering the Horn’s non-Peng, the jia and yi’s celestial grandson, the three heavens’ luminous white—ghosts are thus commanded by the August Heaven’s decree. The six ding comply as the statutes command. The hundred ghosts, not the stars, depart urgently. The three heavens’ mandate—above, it becomes the forest’s ghosts. The young’s sincerity decides the sun’s division into places of emergence and departure. Joy accompanies the azure tiger. The Three Sovereigns’ northern edict—also named the Twenty-Eight Constellations—advances the mandate. The Great One emerges from the vast heavens’ nine tracks, suddenly possessing the statutes’ enclosure. Movement and pacing comply with the almanac’s records. The three urgent commands of the luminous lord differ—thus, the nine rivers’ avoidance texts appear. The Thunder Duke differs—thus, the nine rivers blaze, governing the myriad emergences. The Dipper and Ox extend life without end. The celestial minister’s mutual assistance does not terminate the statutory text.\n\n**[The Human Sovereign’s section comprises 158 graphs.]**\n\nThe nine heavens command the Upper Heaven’s lesser Northern Army, the Eastern Sea’s Azure Lad, the Dark General, the Divine King Father, the responsive jade stars’ positions, the jade maidens, the mysterious deities, the Great Emperor, the Thunder Duke’s arrayed positions, the yang ding, the Three Sovereigns, the Five Lords, the Six Dukes. The exalted names reach the celestial chambers, entering all rivers and peaks.\n\n**[The Great Talisman comprises 50 graphs.]**\n\nThe High Nine Heavens command the August Emperor of the Upper Heaven, the lesser Northern Army, the Eastern Sea’s Lesser Lad, the Dark General’s horse, the Divine King Father, the responsive Queen Mother bearing positions, the jade maidens, the mysterious deities, the Clear Heaven’s Supreme Emperor, the Cloud Thunder Duke’s arrayed positions, the yin and yang’s six ding, the Three Sovereigns, the Five Lords. The urgent memorial commands compliance. The exalted summons the High Heaven’s Western Chamber Lady, entering all rivers and peaks’ forty-eight seated positions. The celestial and earthly various maidens’ talismans arrive as summoned. The Jade Maiden, Plain Maiden, Charming Maiden, Purple Radiance, Mysterious Essence, River Wondrous One, the Five Peaks’ Azure Forest, the Nine Heavens’ parents, the Wind Earl—send names urgently as commanded.

The Year Star assists the liver; Horn, Neck, and the Four Quarters’ revolving scenes are governed by Winnowing Basket, master of the Seven Luminaries. The Dipper’s bright wheel receives qi, seizing the false and sweeping away calamities. The Eastern Mountain’s divine incantation summons the Nine Heavens’ Red Script talismans to bind Fengdu, restrain demons, and dispatch ghosts—none dare evade execution. All are sent to the Wood Palace. Should any delay, the Eastern River and the Vast Sea’s water spirits shall be constrained: great kalpas of floods, dragons bearing disasters, and the Water Palace’s paths—hundreds and thousands of passages—shall be opened by the Supreme Emperor’s Red Writ amid the primordial wind and fire.\n\n**Eastern Direction Talisman (16 graphs):**\nThe Nine Qi’s Azure Heaven illuminates the true Dao; the Jade Talisman commands qi, treasured by all perfected beings.\n\n**Southern Direction (148 graphs):**\nWithin the Vermilion Heaven’s Crimson Emperor and Jade Hall resides a great spirit named the Crimson Sovereign, whose blazing flames and threefold qi radiate brilliance. Immortals receive their mandate in accord with destiny; the Great Fire Star assists the heart. Well and Ghost guard Chamber; Willow, Star, Spread, and Wing resist the Four Quarters. The Seven Lodgings revolve, the celestial constant summoned to hasten convergence upon the true Dao. The Red Writ commands spirits; the north binds Fengdu, dispatching demonic lineages and severing evil roots. The talisman’s decree punishes clearly, enumerating crimes. The Southern Mountain’s divine incantation subdues the Eight Directions’ myriad demons, annihilating all trials. The Southern River’s Water Emperor, Great Earl, and Dragon Kings’ incantations circulate, universally sweeping away inauspicious floods and flying disasters. Dragons are summoned to open and clear waterways—thousands of paths, myriad passages. Should any dare transgress, they shall be sent to the Fire Palace by the Red Writ’s proclamation; none may disobey.\n\n**Southern Direction Talisman (8 graphs):**\nThe Primordial Supreme Emperor opens Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Central Direction (144 graphs):**\nThe Yellow High Heaven’s Central Numinous One, the Primordial, gives birth to the Five Elders. The August Highest commands qi, supervises the perfected, and oversees the immortals’ records and mysterious charts. Jade Writs hasten the ascent of qi, universally notifying the myriad spirits. The Quelling Star assists the spleen; the Northern Culmen revolves, mastering the false and severing evil roots. Dust is swept away, miasmas dispelled. The Mysterious Dipper’s bright degrees traverse the Celestial Pass. The Nine Heavens’ talismanic commands are transmitted by the Golden Horse Post, constraining the Northern Emperor to block the Ghost Gate and excise inauspiciousness. None may stand before it. The Central Mountain’s divine incantation summons dragons to ascend clouds, converging upon the Yellow River’s nine streams. The river’s source may not overflow; good and evil are distinguished. A thousand demons and myriad deceits face the Emperor Lord. Should any dare transgress, the Great Yang’s scorching flames shall burn the Red Writ’s jade graphs, proclaiming universally.\n\n**Central Direction Talisman (9 graphs):**\nMaster all immortals, command and summon the river’s source.\n\n**Western Direction (136 graphs):**\nThe White Emperor of the Pale Heaven’s Seven Gates, the Golden Numinous One, shines resplendently. The Great Hua’s flowing vapors and the towering White Stone’s sevenfold qi billow upward. There dwells the Primordial Elder, a great spirit who oversees lung qi, governs the Nine Heavens’ registers, and commands the ascent of immortals. The Great White Star inspects the lungs; Straddler and Harvester guard the soul; Stomach, Mane, and Net assist. The Seven Passes are mastered by the Three Stars; the Dipper’s handle receives talismans. The Northern Culmen’s Red Writ and jade graphs, the Nine Heavens’ true script, summon the myriad qi to return universally to the Emperor Lord. The Western Mountain’s divine incantation, the Eight Might’s Seven Transmissions, summons dragons from waters and clouds from mountains, all converging at the Emperor’s gate to assist and guard the perfected. Evil roots are severed. Should any inauspiciousness arise, it shall be cut off by the Golden Pass. The Red Writ’s talismanic commands are transmitted by wind and fire.\n\n**Western Direction Talisman (7 graphs):**\nAdvance the true, command the correct, and all spirits obey.\n\n**Northern Direction (120 graphs):**\nThe Dark Heaven’s Five Qi meander; within dwell the Black Emperor and the Twin Sovereigns of the Great Subtlety, who oversee talismanic commands. Immortals refine the Eight Might, clad in azure skirts and feathered capes, dragon-patterned and phoenix-robed. The Supreme Emperor’s decrees ascend the Jade Stairs. The Northern Culmen assists the kidneys; Dipper and Oxguard defend the gates; Girl, Void, Rooftop, and Encampment open the Four Quarters. The Seven Stars grasp the baleful, rectify the false, and sweep away calamities, illuminating the Dao with penetrating radiance.

Thirty-nine Emperors, Five Venerables of Highest Clarity, white auspiciousness unfolds at dawn. Exalted Transcendents scatter essence, Eight Effulgences pacing the void. Three Primordials swiftly flow with jade-like truth, descending to gaze upon the empty courtyard. Daring to present this jade writ, I report above to the Three Numinous Officials. The jade tally records the hidden writ, the Three Primordials’ inner names. Contemplate the obscure, invoke the spirits, though you have not beheld their true forms, yet seek the exalted Transcendent. Lofty Mystery comes to reflect the essence of the Nine Heavens, overseeing the myriad in the Cavern’s governance. The Five Venerables and Supreme Perfected explain karmic roots, delivering the Seven Mysteries. Bearing this writ, the Three Primordials instruct below, ascending to the rank of Transcendent King. It is conferred upon the Lord of Longevity of Grand Florescence, the Eastern Florescence Venerable, the Southern Culmen Honored Deity, the Western Terrace Central Attendant, the Northern Thearch Central Perfected, the Nine Numinous Kingly Youth, the Jade Youth of the Supreme Numinous, the Nine Heavens’ Thearch. The natural true writ, hidden taboo, precious register—within it, myriad spirits guard and escort, exiting and entering the void, soaring and flying, ever manifesting in union with the Thearch. Great calamities are swept away, myriad qi incomplete. Mysterious names are recorded; those who behold the true numinous, if they leak the secret, will fall as Transcendents. Seven ancestors will be dragged along, together filling the river’s source. Riding clouds in revolution, naturally clad in feathered skirts, crimson sun fixed in the register, returning to the Golden Gate. Thearch Wang, vast and solitary, act with caution, forget not the Three Primordials, Grand Simplicity, Cavern Mystery’s manifest writ.

The Flying Tiger clenches its body, gathering essence and primordial yellow. Nine ascend to the Heavenly Stone, shattering birds in purple’s midst. Roaming the central mystery, the Dark Chief devours from the mountain, stripping subtlety’s true pattern. No spirit-eye sees the beast’s base; the vermilion comes, qi eternal. Four thousand fierce ones leap in heaven, their fangs in the palace. The Nine Ford Envoys wield blades and axes; the Hundred Scales proclaim the subtle master.

      "translated_text": "**Conveyance Talisman of Daoist Practices**\n\nThe Primordial Qi of the Nine Mysteries generates through natural refinement, merging the Eight Paths to form the Embryonic Immortal, descending into the Purple Void’s Radiant Jade Pavilion. Riding the flow, mastering qi, traversing the heavens, ascending through the Nine Gates, entering the Northern Pass—where the Three Departments’ perfected ones command—this covenant is sworn, its text recorded upon purple and plain silk. At the destined time, mounting the Nine-Five, serving the Sagely Thearch at the River Ford, swiftly guiding the Eight Paths, circulating the Seven Primes, riding the void to soar through space, aiding the Imperial Honored One, dissolving karmic knots. Three thousand Jade Lads and Jade Maidens each are assigned to safeguard and report, protecting this body’s destiny.\n\n**White-Textured Jade Sash with Knotted Patterns**\n\nIn utmost stillness, the empty mystery, the formless numinous script—all derive from the Nine Perfected’s texts, reckoned by cycles, measured by degrees, activated by natural resonance. Momentarily passing through the Mysterious Mother’s transformations, born through the Dark Pass, the Supreme Nine Qi fill the Upper Perfected; the Nine Heavens’ essence congeals to fill the Middle Prime; the Five Emperors’ transformations merge to fill the Five Spirits; the Three Mysteries’ vast numina unite to complete the Imperial Perfected. Those who practice this Dao, govern records, and receive the texts of Central Yellow and Purple Silk shall command the numinous chapters. This body, responsive to the Three Offices, shall mount the Nine Mysteries, ingest the Jade Script, ascend at dawn to receive the mandate, and freely traverse. Dare one violate this covenant? Transgressors shall be bound by law, their bodies submerged in the River Source, eternally consigned to the Dark Night, bearing the fires of the Three Wastes and the Five Sufferings. None shall presume pardon. All who come forth to awaken—henceforth renewed—shall be reported by the Four Offices and Five Emperors, their names submitted above. The Nine Heavens shall proclaim, and the myriad spirits shall respond. Perfected ones shall descend to the chamber, soaring through the clouds beneath light canopies of kingfisher plumes and azure skirts, to welcome this body’s ascent to the Imperial Dawn, where it shall roam the Nine Void-Palaces and feast in the Three Primes’ radiance. On this day, all proclamations and decrees shall be fulfilled without fail.\n\n**Right: Conveyance Record of 460 characters.**\n\n**Azure Primordial’s Vast Numinous Lesser Yang Master**\nThe Nine Qi return to the liver, calming my hun-soul within the Dark Bureau. The Flower Treasury is inwardly bound, its brilliance refined, the visage fortified, the marrow consolidated. White reverts to azure; the spirit transforms within, emitting radiance to ascend the Purple Court. Dare one violate this sincerity? The flowing bells shall be shattered. The Jade Record of the Supreme Clarity’s Perfected Instructions perfects immortality, ferries the perfected, and soars through the Jade Clarity to ascend the Prime, receiving qi and returning amidst cloud chariots.\n\n**Right: Azure Lad’s 72 Jade Characters.**\n\n**Riding Clouds, Flying Chariots, Jade Maidens of the Cassia attend; the Azure Lad receives the mandate.**\n\n**One Talisman of Twelve Characters:**\n*Supreme Perfected, Supreme Minister, Azure Lad’s Sixfold Petition for Immortal Ascension and Life’s Salvation.*\n\n**Later Talisman of Fourteen Characters:**\n**Right: Supreme Minister Azure Lad’s 26 Characters.**\n\n**Crimson Essence supplements and nurtures my body; the High Perfected’s Three Qi return to the heart. This is my Cinnabar Prime, lifting my floating form to swiftly memorialize and report. The heart is steadfast, the spirit tranquil; the Nine Numinous Passes are secured by Golden Perfection. Within, purple mist gathers; clouds form in the Supreme Subtlety. Green script inscribes the name—Divine Immortal.*\n\n**Right: Three-Nine Plain Speech of 47 Characters.**\n\n**Nine Heavens’ Life Talisman restores the hun-soul, ferries life, and ascends to the Supreme Clarity’s Lord.**\n**First: Thirteen Characters.**\n\n**Three Heavens’ Nine-Five Rectifies and Measures Life; the Seven-Nine Three Qi’s Mysterious Prime Cinnabar Talisman ferries life.**\n**Second: Twenty-Eight Characters.**\n\n**The Thearch’s Hun-Essence, Nine Spirits’ Prime Life, Three-Five Essence, Seven Primes’ Mountain.**\n**Third: Thirty-Four Characters.**\n\n**Right: Plain Numinous Cavern Mystery’s Supreme Three Talismans of 45 Jade Characters.**\n\n**Plain Primordial’s Cavern Void, Heavenly Perfected’s Divine Hut—Seven Qi guard the lungs, a hundred spirits cohabit. Refining the Five Viscera, merging their splendor, unfolding purity, clarifying sincerity, the luminous stone roams the Mysterious Void. The White Jade Gold Script of the Nine Emperors’ Perfected Writ enables my flight as an immortal; death’s name is expunged. Roaming the Three Clarities, I go where I please.**\n\n**Right: Transformations’ Seventy-Four Directions of Fifty-Six Characters.**\n\n**Primordial Hundred Heavens’ Left Eye’s Rank Chapter, Great King Mountain’s Five-Six Wu-Ji, Pure Mystery’s Four-Eight Perfected One. The Five Qi’s Supreme Chapter, the Jade Script’s Imperial Chapter, descends to bestow upon this text. At that time, celestial light suffused the jade, reaching the Three Dawns. The Five Lodgings altered their courses; the Seven Primes circulated their numina. Nine hues blazed, resplendent, descending into the Jade Clarity. Flying mists billowed, streaming through the Eight Directions. Beneath the Jade Sovereign’s throne, myriad treasures’ chapters alighted in the court. Flying immortals with feathered canopies flanked the Supreme Perfected. Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, three thousand each, seized the ghostly records, subdued demonic hordes, and vanquished wandering spirits. Soaring through the clouds, they turned and rode the void, descending amidst mist. Divine phoenixes harnessed reins; numinous consorts guided the immortals. Bright stars illuminated the path; the Three Paths merged in brilliance. Lightning flashed, essence scattered. Driving the Nine Mysteries, I surveyed the jade palaces, feasted in the Three Primes’ radiance, and circled the Jade Empyrean. Freely traversing the Purple Dawn, I unfolded the luminous script’s boundlessness, stamping the Imperial Chapter to hasten its form. Azure clouds ordered the lodgings’ roots within the Jade Instructions; majestic numina were stirred within the Jade Script to ferry celestial and human beings. Serene contemplation focused upon the Jade Pavilion; the Two Modes were ordered within the Mysterious Diagram. The Thearch’s records were held among the myriad immortals; the Earth’s offices were governed by the Five Peaks.
