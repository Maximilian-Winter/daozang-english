Once, by the Divine Transformation Stream in the Cavernous Emptiness Grotto of the Western Capital, she encountered the Grand Clarity’s Supreme Mystery Primordial Perfected Lady descending upon the stream’s bank. Marveling at this, the Perfected Lady approached to pay her respects. Together they entered the grotto, where she was bestowed the Primordial Beginning’s Great Dao. Instructed to ride a withered tree and drift with the current, she soon found the tree restored to its original place, the celestial being vanished without a trace. The Perfected Lady thereby unified the four lineages into one.

Indifferent to fame and profit, his learning bridged heaven and humanity. Serving the Song, he rose to the position of Guangxi’s Provincial Governor. Once, he encountered the Preserving Unity Perfected, who bestowed upon him the Supreme Dao, enabling him to command spirits and deities. One day, a crimson-robed official descended into his courtyard and addressed the Perfected: \"The Emperor has heard of your name and now appoints you as the Six Penetrations’ Controller of Waters in the Dipper. You are to propagate the mysterious teachings and broadly deliver living beings. When your merit is complete, you shall be summoned back to the Golden Watchtower.\" With these words, the crimson-robed official ascended into the sky. He secluded himself on Mount Green City.\n\n**The Azure Waters’ Thunder Abyss Perfected**, Huang Shunshen, styled Huibo.\nA native of Jianning, born at the hour of Wei on the fifth day of the intercalary eighth lunar month in the Jiachen year. Precociously intelligent, he perused all books of the Three Teachings and Nine Schools. While accompanying his father on official duties in Guangxi, the Provincial Governor, the Reclusive Perfected of Eyebrow Mountain, saw him and marveled, entrusting him with all his writings.\n\nThe Master delved into mysteries and probed profundities, compiling them into a comprehensive compendium. Scholars flocked to his gate, their caps and carriages like clouds. Later, he was summoned to court, then received the imperial decree to return to the mountains. He secluded himself upon Purple Radiance Isle, becoming the preeminent master of his age.\n\n**On Daoist Practices and Resolving Doubts**\nDaoist cultivation is akin to the Confucian study of investigating things. For in practice, rectifying the mind and sincerity of intent are paramount. If the mind is not rectified, it cannot move things; if intent is not sincere, it cannot communicate with spirits. When spirit operates here, things respond there. Thus, though separated by a thousand miles, one may breathe as if face-to-face—who but the utterly sincere can achieve this?\n\nAlas! Vast and boundless is the mind; subtly interconnected is the spirit. Yet if the mind is not preserved, it remains unclear; if the spirit is not nurtured, it lacks efficacy. Only through long preservation does clarity arise; only through long nurturance does efficacy manifest. Scholars of this world, neglecting daily cultivation, rush to act in a single moment—like drawing sweet water from a dry well or plucking rare blossoms from withered wood. I see they shall not succeed. When their qi is exhausted and their spirit startled, inviting scorn and disdain, they then blame the spirit’s inefficacy or the method’s failure—how lamentable!\n\nSome masters, failing to grasp these profound mysteries, cling to the notion that rituals and sacrifices alone invoke efficacy, thereby misleading later generations. Consequently, disciples focus solely on offerings and sacrifices, harming creatures and wasting life. They summon wandering, food-seeking ghosts, whose numbers grow daily, forming factions. Claiming to command and control spirits at will, they do not realize that using evil to attack evil truly harms the practitioner’s own body.\n\nFrom my youth, I cherished cultivation, collecting several chests of ritual texts and hundreds of seals, believing these were the extent of the methods. Yet my resolve was firm, and Heaven guided my heart. Suddenly, I encountered a perfected one who transmitted oral instructions—no more than a few phrases—and I roamed freely among all methods. Only then did I realize that generals and officials reside within the body, and the divine does not depart from the square inch of the heart. Those of noble aspirations who earnestly seek the Dao and its methods must not be ignorant of this principle.\n\n**The Great Libation Rites of the Numinous Treasure**\nWhen the Primal Chaos divided, it formed the Three Caverns, also called the Three Heavens, designating the Three Treasures. The Cavern of Reality is the Heaven of Pure Tenuity, the Treasure of the Dao, ruled by the Emperor. The Cavern of Mystery is the Heaven of Jade Clarity, the Numinous Treasure, and the Cavern of Divinity is the Heaven of Great Vermilion, the Divine Treasure—both governed by ministers. Thus, they reverently follow the origin of the Primordial Beginning to expound the Dao of Pure Tenuity, producing scriptures.\n\nThe Lord of the Dao of Jade Clarity of the Numinous Treasure was born in the Western Jade Kingdom of Na. From there, phoenix-inscribed decrees and dragon-script edicts were transmitted to the human world.

Through the power of the Dao, may all attain transcendence.\n\nDaring to offend your celestial majesty, your minister trembles with awe, prostrating beneath the heavens and upon the earth, humbly awaiting your decree.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n*On the [day] of the [month] in the year of Tai Sui, Minister of Rank [Name] presents this memorial.*\n\n**Enclosure: Azure Talisman**\n*Memorial Transmission*\n*Minister [Name]*\nSealed in a square vermilion envelope, with credentials, an introductory memorial, a duplicate of the written petition, and talismans—all prepared as previously prescribed.

With due solemnity, I now summon the Sixty-Four Perfected of the Jade Essence, who command the Eight Radiant Great Spirits to emerge. Let those who emerge don ceremonial tassels and robes, observe proper decorum, and accompany me in this memorial.\n\nWith reverence, I summon the Nine Hundred Million Azure *Qi* of my person, the Nine Thousand Numinous Officials, and the myriad billions of mounted clerks. Let those who emerge don ceremonial tassels and robes, observe proper decorum, and accompany me in this memorial.\n\nWith reverence, I summon the Three Hundred Million Vermilion *Qi* of my person, the Three Thousand Numinous Officials, and the myriad billions of mounted clerks.

Let those who emerge don ceremonial tassels and robes, observe proper decorum, and accompany me in this memorial.\n\nWith reverence, I summon the Five Hundred Million Black *Qi* of my person, the Five Thousand Numinous Officials, and the myriad billions of mounted clerks.

Let those who emerge don ceremonial tassels and robes, observe proper decorum, and accompany me in this memorial.\n\nWith reverence, I summon the Celestial Scribe of the Jade Bureau of the Great Tenuity, the Primordial Sovereign of the Mysterious Origin, who presents petitions. Let him emerge to guide me in ascending to the Luminous Primordial Balance Hall of the Jade Clarity Palace of the Great Tenuity, that my memorial may swiftly reach the imperial realm. May what I memorialize be conveyed, and what I address be received. May every earnest plea be answered without delay.\n\nThrough the Direct Envoys of the Two Bureaus, I now, with utmost reverence, address the Jade Sovereign of the August Heaven, the Jade August Thearch.

regular offerings,\nbut it is not used in the Nine Audiences of the Yellow Register.\n\n**Form of the Blue Petition**\nDuring the Tianbao era of the Tang, wooden prayer tablets were replaced with plain petitions written on paper.\nIn the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song, blue paper was adopted, hence the name \"Blue Petition.\"\nThe significance of the pure and the blue—both rooted in primal origins—must not be overlooked.\n\nThe text of such petitions should not exceed sixty or seventy characters,\nand phrases like \"I humbly reflect\" or \"prostrating in thought\" are not to be used.\nThis is the standard format for memorials, strict and solemn.\nThe petition should first state the aspiration, then directly present the matter at hand.\nParallel phrasing and couplets are to be avoided,\nfor while they may ease recitation, they obscure the meaning of the text.\nMoreover, parallelism often leads to redundancy, compromising concision and clarity.\n\nThe principle states:\nThe form of a petition should be substantive rather than ornate,\nunadorned rather than refined,\nplain rather than florid,\ntrue rather than false,\ndirect rather than circuitous,\npersuasive rather than verbose,\nmodest rather than coarse,\npure rather than turbid,\nupright rather than deviant.\nConcise and sincere, it may then move heaven and earth,\nstir gods and spirits,\nascend directly to the celestial bureaus,\nand elicit an immediate response.\n\nThose who violate this shall be held accountable by the officials of the Bureau of Transgressions and the Enforcers of the Law.\n\n**Form of the Yellow Register**\n\n**Lingbao Yanghua Golden Precepts for Ascension to the Yellow Register**\nYellow-split paper, inscribed in black with vermilion talismanic

The case of Zhang Lihua stands as particularly luminous evidence. Records state: upon reciting the scripture nine times—precisely at the moment of repentance—one ignites the tablet and memorial, confirming that the submission of the tablet should occur at the culmination of the meritorious deed.\n\nRecently, some have taken to burning the *Salvation from Suffering* talisman at the outset of the memorial, believing this liberates the deceased from hell. Yet this is unsound. For the extraction of the soul has its own documents, and the white tablet should be proclaimed at the time of transmission, allowing the deceased to ride the power of the ritual’s merits, the vows, the precepts, and the repentance for renewal. Only then, after offering the tablet and proclaiming below, are the sins pardoned and grievances released by the Ten Directions, enabling true liberation from hell and ascent to the Vermilion Palace.\n\nThus the scripture states: *\"When the beings of the Nine Dark Hells hear the Northern Emperor’s broad entreaty, their hearts generate remorse and they seek deliverance. Only then does the Heavenly Worthy expound the precepts and bestow the talisman.\"* This is especially reliable.\n\nMoreover, reciting and inscribing talismans is no arduous task. One who can inscribe the twenty-four faces may commit them to memory, for the meaning of talismans and incantations aligns. Let one attempt this, and they will know these words are not false.\n\n**Three Tablets of the Three Primes**\n*Upper Prime Tablet*\n\n**Upper Prime Tablet**\n*Complete*   *Bright*   *Illuminating*   *Radiant*\n*Subtle*   *Chariot*   *Imperial*   *Court*\nThe Yuan-shi Fu-ming of the Qingwei Inner Talismans, Jade Tablet of the Three Heavens, is proclaimed to the Upper Prime Heavenly Officials of the Tai-ji Palace and the thirty-six bureaus of the Examination and Registry.

Former worthies, upon concluding the altar rites, would reaffirm their vows through the Fast, a practice most excellent.\n\nThe tablets are made of hibiscus wood to signify purity of intent, and borne by Golden Dragons. The tablet’s length and breadth should match the dimensions of a hollow-bottomed wooden stand, upon which it is placed. The dragon rests within the hollow to bear the tablet. Some place the Earth Mansion tablet with the dragon seated to guard the dwelling—a vulgar notion. How could a seated dragon convey the tablet?\n\nBlue silk substitutes for severed hair: for each tablet, twenty-four feet are used to bind the dragon. Each of the Three Mansions has its prescribed number of loops. Twenty-one golden knots are prepared, seven for each tablet, tied upon the silk as the dragon’s bridle, symbolizing steadfastness.\n\nJade disks are added to express reverence, for rites demand precious offerings.

      "translated_text": "The Master delved into mysteries and probed profundities, compiling them into a comprehensive compendium. Scholars flocked to his gate, their caps and carriages like clouds. Later, he was summoned to court, then received the imperial decree to return to the mountains. He secluded himself upon Purple Radiance Isle, becoming the preeminent master of his age.\n\n**On Daoist Practices and Resolving Doubts**\nDaoist cultivation is akin to the Confucian study of investigating things. For in practice, rectifying the mind and sincerity of intent are paramount. If the mind is not rectified, it cannot move things; if intent is not sincere, it cannot communicate with spirits. When spirit operates here, things respond there. Thus, though separated by a thousand miles, one may breathe as if face-to-face—who but the utterly sincere can achieve this?\n\nAlas! Vast and boundless is the mind; subtly interconnected is the spirit. Yet if the mind is not preserved, it remains unclear; if the spirit is not nurtured, it lacks efficacy. Only through long preservation does clarity arise; only through long nurturance does efficacy manifest. Scholars of this world, neglecting daily cultivation, rush to act in a single moment—like drawing sweet water from a dry well or plucking rare blossoms from withered wood. I see they shall not succeed. When their qi is exhausted and their spirit startled, inviting scorn and disdain, they then blame the spirit’s inefficacy or the method’s failure—how lamentable!\n\nSome masters, failing to grasp these profound mysteries, cling to the notion that rituals and sacrifices alone invoke efficacy, thereby misleading later generations. Consequently, disciples focus solely on offerings and sacrifices, harming creatures and wasting life. They summon wandering, food-seeking ghosts, whose numbers grow daily, forming factions. Claiming to command and control spirits at will, they do not realize that using evil to attack evil truly harms the practitioner’s own body.\n\nFrom my youth, I cherished cultivation, collecting several chests of ritual texts and hundreds of seals, believing these were the extent of the methods. Yet my resolve was firm, and Heaven guided my heart. Suddenly, I encountered a perfected one who transmitted oral instructions—no more than a few phrases—and I roamed freely among all methods. Only then did I realize that generals and officials reside within the body, and the divine does not depart from the square inch of the heart. Those of noble aspirations who earnestly seek the Dao and its methods must not be ignorant of this principle.\n\n**The Great Libation Rites of the Numinous Treasure**\nWhen the Primal Chaos divided, it formed the Three Caverns, also called the Three Heavens, designating the Three Treasures. The Cavern of Reality is the Heaven of Pure Tenuity, the Treasure of the Dao, ruled by the Emperor. The Cavern of Mystery is the Heaven of Jade Clarity, the Numinous Treasure, and the Cavern of Divinity is the Heaven of Great Vermilion, the Divine Treasure—both governed by ministers. Thus, they reverently follow the origin of the Primordial Beginning to expound the Dao of Pure Tenuity, producing scriptures.\n\nThe Lord of the Dao of Jade Clarity of the Numinous Treasure was born in the Western Jade Kingdom of Na. From there, phoenix-inscribed decrees and dragon-script edicts were transmitted to the human world. Later, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate descended to the Left Palace Immortal Elder, responding to the era of the Grand Purity. Transforming and governing the Orthodox Unity, they passed down myriad methods—sacred and divine—forming the *Inner Essentials of the Numinous Treasure*.\n\nCollectively called the *Great Libation Rites of the Primordial Azure*, they are practiced under the Primordial Azure Gate’s Branch Office. Also termed the *Numinous Treasure Libation Rites*, they are administered by the Yellow Register Court’s Branch Office. Additionally, they are known as the *Bureau of the Great Numinous Treasure*. The overarching institution is the *Palace of the Primordial’s Mysterious Workings*, which encompasses twenty-four bureaus:\n\n1. Yuanluo Fan Jing Bureau\n2. Yuanluo Tai Xia Bureau\n3.

Fortuitously coinciding with the full moon and the Zhongyuan Festival, we establish a jade altar in the realm of the Perfected and open the jeweled palace of the Liao-Yang Heaven. We uphold the Yellow Register fast, perform the rites of the Qingwei tradition, and prepare for the covenant on [such-and-such] day, secretly communicating with the Six Directions.

We again knock upon the tablet, reiterating the purpose, and conclude by announcing the dispatch.\n\nThe following day, we dismantle the altar and disperse the assembly, manifesting our gratitude for the imperial grace. Having completed the offerings, we establish a pure libation for the High Perfected of the Three Realms, gathering extraordinary blessings of compassion. We pray for the Emperor’s ten-thousand-year reign, the Crown Prince’s thousand-year longevity, and that all participants in the covenant may equally partake in the radiant blessings.\n\nYour subordinate respectfully invokes the wondrous qi of the myriad spirits from the Hongqing Palace.

The case of Zhang Lihua stands as particularly luminous evidence. Records state: upon reciting the scripture nine times—precisely at the moment of repentance—one ignites the tablet and memorial, confirming that the submission of the tablet should occur at the culmination of the meritorious deed.\n\nRecently, some have taken to burning the *Salvation from Suffering* talisman at the outset of the memorial, believing this liberates the deceased from hell. Yet this is unsound. For the extraction of the soul has its own documents, and the white tablet should be proclaimed at the time of transmission, allowing the deceased to ride the power of the ritual’s merits, the vows, the precepts, and the repentance for renewal. Only then, after offering the tablet and proclaiming below, are the sins pardoned and grievances released by the Ten Directions, enabling true liberation from hell and ascent to the Vermilion Palace.\n\nThus the scripture states: *\"When the beings of the Nine Dark Hells hear the Northern Emperor’s broad entreaty, their hearts generate remorse and they seek deliverance. Only then does the Heavenly Worthy expound the precepts and bestow the talisman.\"* This is especially reliable.\n\nMoreover, reciting and inscribing talismans is no arduous task. One who can inscribe the twenty-four faces may commit them to memory, for the meaning of talismans and incantations aligns. Let one attempt this, and they will know these words are not false.\n\n**Three Tablets of the Three Primes**\n*Upper Prime Tablet*",
